CHAPTER I.
WE THREE.



"Sisters and brothers, little maid,
How many may you be?"
      





think the best beginning
is the morning
that grandpapa sent for
us to come down to the
study. Tib and Gerald,
don't think so. They
say I should begin by
telling our names, and
how old we were, and
all that       at least, Gerald says so; Tib isn't
quite sure. Tib very often isn't quite sure.
She has got too grand ideas, and if she
were going to write a story, she would
make it like poetry, very difficult to understand,
and awfully long words, and lots
about feelings and sorrows and mysteries.
I like mysteries, too       I think they are very
interesting, and I have one to tell about,
as you will see, only I must tell it my own
way, and after all, as this story is only to be
read by Tib and Gerald       and our children       we
have settled that when we are all
three grown-up and married, and have
children, it shall be made into a book for
them       I daresay it doesn't much matter
how it is told.

Well, that morning we were all poking
our heads as far as we dared out of the
school-room window       Miss Evans hadn't yet
come       to see the first primrose man that
had passed that year. We heard his "All
a blowing, all a growing," far off down
the street, but we hadn't yet seen him and
his basket with the beautiful light yellow
bunches at the top, and we were wondering
if we could get Fanny to run out and
buy us twopence-worth, when Bland stuck
his solemn and rather crabbed-looking
face in at the door.
Bland is grandpapa's
"own man,"
as they say,
and his
name
doesn't
suit
him
at all       at
least, it didn't then       he's not so bad now
we're older.

"Young ladies and Master Gerald," he
said, "my master wishes you all to come
down stairs to speak to him before he goes
out."

Down we all tumbled from the window-sill.
Tib and I began smoothing our aprons
and tugging at each other's hair       grandpapa
was very particular. Gerald only looked at
his hands.

"They are rather dirty," he said seriously.
"But I did wash them so very well this
morning, and it's not ten o'clock yet. Do
you think, Gussie              ?"

I knew what he was going to say, so I cut
him short.

"Yes, I do think you'd better run and
wash them at once       why, you might have
had them done by now       they are just
perfectly grimy."

For Gerald would any day talk for ten
minutes about why he needn't wash his
hands rather than run off and do them. I
am afraid he was rather a dirty little boy       he'll
be very angry if he sees that, for he is now
getting to be very particular indeed       for
though he liked bathing in the sea, he
would do anything to avoid washing       regular
good soapy washing. But he was
too afraid of grandpapa to stand out when
I said his hands were as bad as "grimy;"
so off he went.

"Are we to come down at once?" asked
Tib.

"Yes, miss. Your grandpapa has ordered
the brougham to be round in ten minutes,"
Bland graciously informed us as Gerald
started off.

"I wonder what it's about?" said Tib.
"I hope he's not vexed with us."

For it wasn't often that grandpapa sent
for us in the morning, except on birthdays
or Christmas Day, when he had presents
for us. He never forgot about that, I
must say.

"Why should he be vexed with us?" I
said. "We've not done anything naughty;"
for Tib was standing there with the tears
on their way to her big blue eyes, as I
could see quite well       and I've no patience
with people who look as if they had been
naughty when they haven't.

"Well, you go in first, then, Gussie," said
Tib. "I wish I wasn't frightened, but I
can't help it."

By this time we were on the stairs, not
far from the study door, and Gerald had
run after us, with very red shiny paws, you
may be sure, and in another moment we
were all three in "the august presence," as
Tib called it afterwards.

Grandpapa had just finished his breakfast.
He used often to have it like that,
just on a little tray in the study. It didn't
look very comfortable, and he might quite
as well have had it in the dining-room
all nicely set out, and Tib and me to pour
out his coffee in turns. But he did not
think of it, I suppose, and at that time I
don't think we did, either. We had never
seen any other "ways;" we didn't know
how other families lived       families where
there were mammas, or any way grandmammas,
or aunts, as well as children, and
we were so young that we just took things
as we found them. I think children are
generally like that, especially if they see
very little outside their own homes.

Grandpapa was not old-looking at all       not
the least like the pictures in old-fashioned
books of a very aged man, with
a gentle and rather silly face, and a white
beard, and a stick, sitting in a big arm-chair
by the fire, and patting a very curly-haired
grandchild on the head. I'm quite
sure grandpapa never patted any of us on
the head; and now, of course, we're too
big. But I didn't mind his not being like
the pictures of grandpapas, and now I mind
it still less, for I'm really proud of his being
so nice-looking. That morning I can remember
quite well how he looked as he
sat by the table, with the tray pushed
away, and a whole bundle of letters before
him. He glanced up at us as we came
trooping in, with his bright dark eyes and
a half smile on his face. We were not
very fond of that half smile of his: it
made it so difficult to tell if he was in
fun or earnest.

"Well, young people," he said, "and how
does the wind blow this morning?"

He looked at Gerald as he spoke. Gerald
was staring at his red hands.

"I don't know, grandpapa," he said; and
then seeing that grandpapa's eyes were still
fixed on him, he got uncomfortable, and
tugged Tib, who was next him. "Tib
knows, p'r'aps," he said. "I'm only seven,
grandpapa."

Grandpapa moved his eyes to Tib.

"It strikes me," he said, "that you're
getting too big, young woman, to be spoken
of as if you were a kitten. You must call
your sister by her proper name, Gerald."

"It's hard for him to say, grandpapa,"
said Tib. "That's why Gussie and he
always say Tib, instead of Mercedes."

"Umph!       yes       Tom-fool name!" said
grandpapa, which made me rather angry.

"No, grandpapa, it's not a Tom-fool
name," I said. "It's Spanish; and it was
because our papa and mamma lived in
Spain that they called it her."

I daresay I spoke pertly. Any way, I
was punished, for my words had the effect
of bringing the eyes upon me in my turn.

"Called it her? called it her?" he
repeated slowly. "What English! Miss
Evans is to be congratulated on her success!
So Mercedes is a Spanish name, is
it? Thank you       thank you very much
indeed for the information. Now perhaps
you will all be good enough to listen to
some information from me."

I had got very red while grandpapa was
speaking, quite as much from anger as from
shame, for I wasn't so easily put down as
Tib and Gerald; I had a quicker temper.
But when grandpapa spoke of having information
to give us, I felt so curious to
know what it could be that I tried to look
as if I hadn't minded what he said. So
he went on:

"I'm going to send you all off to the
country next week; I don't want to keep
this house open. I am very busy, and I
would rather live at my club." Grandpapa
stopped a minute. I think he wanted to
see what we would say.

"Are we to go to Ansdell Friars so
soon?" I said. I suppose I didn't seem
very pleased, and no more did Tib or
Gerald. It wasn't very long       only three
or four months       since we had come from
there, and there was nothing at Ansdell we
much cared about. We knew it all so well.
It was a regular big, grand country house;
but its bigness was not much good to us, as
we were strictly shut up in our own rooms,
and sharply scolded if we were found out
of them; and there was nothing amusing
or interesting there. The country is not
pretty, and the walks are not to be compared
with those at       never mind where; I
shall tell you the name of the place in a
little while. So we had no particular
reason for being glad to go back there; on
the whole, I think we liked London better.
We had less of Miss Evans in London, for
she only came every day; but at Ansdell
Friars she lived with us. Grandpapa had
persuaded her to do so, but she didn't like
it, and we didn't like it, so we were not
very happy together. She didn't like
children, and was only a governess because
she had to be, not because she liked it, and
she was always telling us so. I used to
think then all governesses were the same,
but I know better now. There are some
awfully nice, who really like teaching, and
aren't always scolding the children, as if it
was their own fault that they are children
and have to be taught.

"And is Miss Evans coming?" said
Gerald, dolefully.

"You are not going to Ansdell Friars at
all; and, I am sorry to say," grandpapa
went on, "Miss Evans is not able to go
with you. Nurse will have to look after
you till I can find another Miss Evans."

Our faces fell, I have no doubt, at the
last sentence. Another Miss Evans! Still,
it was very nice to think there'd be no
Miss Evans for a while. Nurse looking
after us meant, as we knew very well, that
we should do pretty much as we liked; for
nurse spoiled us most horribly. It was a
very delightful prospect.

"We'll try to be very good, grandpapa,"
said Tib.

"Umph!" said grandpapa.

"And when are we going, please?" I
could not resist putting in. I was burning
with curiosity, and so, I am sure, were the
others, though they were afraid to ask.
Grandpapa looked at me.

"Upon my word, Gustava," he said, "I
think you might give me time to tell you.
When I was young, children were not
allowed to cross-question their elders. You
are going to a little country house I have
which you have never seen nor heard of.
It is much nearer town than Ansdell Friars,
so I shall be able to come down every
now and then to see you, and to hear if
you are behaving properly. It is a much
smaller place than Ansdell       in fact, it's
quite a small house. But there's a good
garden; you will have plenty of space to
play in. Only I wish you to understand
one thing: there are other houses near       it
isn't like Ansdell, all alone in a park       and
neighbours, of course. Now, I won't
have you make friends with any one unless
I tell you you may. You are not to go
into other people's houses or to chatter to
strangers. Do you understand?"

"Yes, grandpapa," we all three replied,
feeling rather frightened. I don't think
we did quite understand, for we never had
made friends with any one. We had lived
very solitary lives, without any companions
of our own age       for we had scarcely any
relations, and none that we knew anything
of. And as people don't miss what they
have never had, I don't think it would
ever have come into our heads to do what
grandpapa was so afraid of. He certainly
made us think more about other people
than we had ever done before.

"What is the name of the place,
please, grandpapa?" asked Tib in her
soft voice.

If it had been me that had asked it, he
would have snubbed me again. But it was
certainly true, as the servants all said, that
he favoured Tib the most. Perhaps it was
that she was so pretty       perhaps it was for
a reason that I can't tell just yet.

"The name of the place," he repeated       "of
the house, I suppose you mean? The
name of the place does not matter to you.
You will not have to take your own tickets
at the station. The house has an absurd
name, but as it has always been called so,
it is no use thinking of changing it. It is
called 'Rosebuds.'"

Grandpapa stood up as he spoke, and just
then Bland opened the door to announce
the carriage. So we all said good-bye to
him and trotted off. We knew we should
probably not see him again for two or
three days, but we were so used to it we
did not care; and we had plenty to
interest our minds and give us something
to talk of.

"What a very pretty name 'Rosebuds' is,"
Tib exclaimed, as soon as we were safely out
of hearing. "I'm sure it must be a very
pretty place to have such a name. I daresay
it's a white cottage, with beautiful
old-fashioned windows, and roses climbing
all over."

"I don't like cottages with roses growing
over them," said Gerald. "There are always
witches living in cottages like that, in the
fairy tales. There is in Snow-white and
Rose-red."

"Well," said Tib, "it would be rather
fun to have a witch at Rosebuds. I do
hope there'll be something interesting
and out of the common there       something
romantic." Tib said the last word
rather slowly. I don't think she was
quite sure how to say it, and I am
quite sure none of us knew what it
meant.

"I hope there'll be nice hide-and-seek
places in the garden, and nice trees for
climbing up, and perhaps grassy hills for
rolling down," said I. "If grandpapa only
comes to see us now and then, and there's
no Miss Evans, and only old Liddy"       old
Liddy was nurse       "it will be very jolly.
I shouldn't wonder       I really shouldn't       if
it was more jolly than we've ever had
anything in our lives       more like how the
children in story-books are, you know,
Tib."

For about this time we had begun to
read a good deal more to ourselves, and
among the old books in grandpapa's library
we had found a nest which contained great
treasures; many of the volumes had belonged
to our father when he was a boy,
and some even had been grandpapa's own
childish books. Grandpapa had given us
leave to read them, and you can fancy what
a treat it was to us, who had had so little
variety in our lives, to get hold of Holiday
House, and the Swiss Family Robinson,
and the Parent's Assistant, and best of
all perhaps, the dearest little shabby,
dumpy, dark-brown book of real old-fashioned
fairy tales. I have it still       no
shabbier for all our thumbing of it: it is
so strongly bound, though it is so plain
and dingy-looking, and I mean to keep it
for my children.

"But grandpapa said he was going
to find another Miss Evans, Gussie,"
said Gerald.

"Never mind. She isn't found yet; and
I don't believe there could be another quite
as bad as this one," I said, consolingly.

But a brilliant idea struck Tib. She
stopped short on the top step but one       we
were climbing up stairs by this
time       before the school-room landing, and
turned round so as to face us two       Gerald
and me.

"I tell you what, Gussie and Gerald," she
said: "suppose we were to be very, just
dreadfully good at our lessons for a little,
don't you think it might make Miss Evans
tell grandpapa that she really thought we
should be the better for a holiday. I
should think even she would like to
do something good-natured before she
left."

Gerald and I stood listening. It was a
grave matter, and we did not want to
commit ourselves hastily.

"Do you mean being very quiet in the
school-room, never whispering to each
other, or making even the least little bit
of funny faces when she's not looking? or
do you mean doing our lessons for her
just awfully well?"

"Both," said Tib, solemnly.

"Oh, I don't think I could," I replied. "It
is so very nice to be naughty sometimes."

"But, Gussie," said Gerald, "any way,
you might settle to do our lessons terribly
well. Don't you see, if we did them
quite well Miss Evans might think we
knew everything, and she might tell grandpapa
we didn't need to learn anything
more."

"And you might settle to be naughty
with us or with Liddy," said Tib, persuasively.
"Gerald and I will promise not
to mind, won't we, Gerald? And we'll
explain to Liddy."

"I'll think about it," was all I could
say.
      

      
CHAPTER II.
THE SCORED-OUT NAME.


"How new life reaps what the old life did sow."
Edwin Arnold.
      





was the naughty
one of the family.
I dare say you       whoever
you are       that
are going
to read this will
have found this
out already, and
it was best to make
it plain at the beginning.
Tib and Gerald were really very
good       at least, they would have been
if I had let them. But still, as I used
often to say to them as a sort of a make-up
for the troubles I got them into, it
would have been rather dull work had we
all three been extra good. And even the
great thing that I have to write about,
the thing that put it into my head to
write at all, would never have come but
for our being in a way naughty       that is
very queer, isn't it? To think that good
and nice things should sometimes come out
of being naughty! I have often puzzled
about it. I think it must be that there
are different kinds of naughtiness       perfectly
different       for nothing good could
come out of real, wicked naughtiness       telling
lies, or being cruel to each other,
or things like that; but the sort of naughtiness
of just being mischievous, and of being
so bubbling over with the niceness of being
alive, that you can't keep quiet, and
remember about not knocking things over
and tearing yourself, and the naughtiness
of hating your lessons on a beautiful day,
when it's really too tempting out-of-doors       all
these kinds of naughtiness and
lots of others I could tell you, for I've
thought so much about it       all these kinds
are different, surely? And one can fancy
good and nice things coming out of them
without getting one's ideas muddled.
That's one thing I'm going to be very
particular about with my children       I'm
going to explain to them well about the
two kinds of being naughty, so that they
won't get all into a puzzle about it. I
think I even shall settle to have two
kinds of words for them; for I do know,
I am sorry to say, what it is to be really
naughty too. Just a few times in my life I
can remember the dreadful feeling of real,
boiling anger at some one       I had it several
times to Miss Evans, and once or twice
to       no, I won't say; it's all so different
now. And once I told what wasn't true,
quite knowing all about it. But I never
did it again. The horribleness of the
feeling was too bad, and in that way my
naughtiness did me good!

Our plan for getting Miss Evans to help
us to a holiday hadn't much chance, as you
shall hear.

When we got to the school-room we found
she hadn't come, though it was a quarter
to ten, and she generally came at half-past
nine.

"Everything seems going topsy-turvy
to-day," said I, seating myself on the high
guard, and swinging my feet about. It
was a very dangerous seat, as the guard
was anything but steady, and if it toppled
over, there was no saying but that you
might be landed in the middle of the fire.
"Miss Evans late       and us going away to a
place we never heard of before! It's almost
as nice as if the sun had forgotten to get up       what
fun that would be!"

"I don't think that would be fun at all,"
said Gerald. "I'd much rather he should
forget to go to bed some night. Which
would you rather, Tib?"

But Tib wasn't listening. She was pressing
her face against the window, her
thoughts intent upon primroses again.

"Hush!" she said; "I'm sure I heard
him. He can't be far off yet, or else it's
another man. Listen." And as she held
up her finger there came softly through the
distance again the "All a growing, all a
blowing."

"I wonder why things seem so much
prettier far off," said Tib, thoughtfully.
But just then the cry came again, and this
time unmistakably nearer. Off darted Tib.
"I will try to get Fanny to catch him," she
said; and in five minutes she was back
again in triumph.

"Fanny wasn't to be found, of course,"
she said. "But that good Liddy poked up
the little page-boy       he's new, so he hasn't
learnt to be impudent yet       and sent him
down the street. We shall have the primroses
directly. Oh, I say, Gussie and
Gerald"       and Tib flung herself down on
the hearth-rug, and rolled herself over, as if
she were on a lawn of beautiful fresh grass       "just
fancy if we were in the country,
and could gather primroses for ourselves       as
many as ever we wanted. Wouldn't it
be lovely?"

"Perhaps we may       perhaps they won't
be over when we go to that place," said
Gerald.

"I wonder when exactly we shall go?" I
said. And then our thoughts all returned
to Rosebuds, and what our grandfather
had said about it.

"I wonder why he doesn't want us to
make friends with any of the neighbours?"
I said. "I think it's rather crabby of him.
There may be some nice children there, and
we never have any playfellows."

"I suppose he's got some reason for it,"
said Tib. "Perhaps the people who live
there are all very common. You know,
grandpapa is right to be particular about
us."

"I don't think it is that. I think he
has some other reason. Tib, do you know,"
I exclaimed, as a curious idea flashed across
my mind, "I have an idea that              "

But I was interrupted before I could say
more by the entrance of old Liddy, bringing
the primroses. They were not very big
bunches, but they were very sweet and
fresh, and we all sniffed at them in a way
that must have astonished the poor things.
Nurse smiled at us.

"I'd like to see you gathering them for
yourselves, my dears," she said.

"Well, we shall, perhaps, if we go to the
country so soon. Do you know that place
where we're going to, Liddy?" asked Tib.

She shook her head       she had come to us
from mamma's family, and she didn't know
much about the Ansdells.

"No, Miss Tib. I never heard of it till
your grandpapa told me last night about
getting you ready. And that reminds me       Bland
told me just now that his master
forgot to say Miss Evans wouldn't be coming
to-day."

"Miss Evans not coming to-day!" we all
three exclaimed in the greatest astonishment,
for it must be confessed Miss Evans was
the most exact person possible. "Is she
never coming any more, Liddy?"

Nurse shook her head.

"Nay, my dear, how should I know? I
only heard what Bland said. Miss Evans
isn't coming with us to the country, master
said."

"But he's going to get another," said
Gerald. "Will she be just exactly the
same       will she have a big freckle on her
cheek, and will she nip up her mouth the
same, do you think, nursey?"

We all burst out laughing at poor
Gerald.

"It would quite spoil Rosebuds to have
the big freckle there," said Tib. "But,
nursey, do you know grandpapa says we're
not to make any friends there, and not to
know anybody?"

This time Liddy nodded her head.

"I know, my dears. Well, it can't be
helped. It'll be no duller for you there
than at Ansdell Friars, any way, and it's a
beautiful country for walks, cook says. She
comes from somewhere that way."

"But why does grandpapa not want us
to know anybody there       do you know,
nursey? Does cook know, perhaps?"

Liddy looked uncomfortable.

"My dears, there may be reasons for
many things that you're too young to understand,"
she said. "If your grandpapa
had wanted to give his reasons to you, he'd
have done so himself; and if he didn't wish
to give you any, it would ill become me to
be telling you over any fancies or chatter I
might hear about master's affairs."

Tib's eyes grew very round.

"I do believe there's a mystery," she said.
"Oh, how beautiful! Nursey, I'm sure you
know something. What fun it would be if
there was really a mystery, and if we were
to find it out. Gussie, do listen."

But I wouldn't listen just that minute.
The thought which had been put out of my
mind by nurse coming in with the primroses
had come back again.

"Wait a minute, Tib," I said, "I've got
an idea. I'm only going down to the library
to fetch a book. I may go as Miss Evans
isn't coming;" and off I flew.

The library was not a large room       indeed,
it was a good deal smaller than grandpapa's
study       but it held a great many books. It
was nothing but books, for there were shelves
all round it, packed as close as they could
hold. In one corner were all the books that
grandpapa allowed us to read. He had
shown them to us himself, and simply told
us we might read any of them we liked,
provided we always put them back again in
their places, but that we mustn't ever take
any other books without asking his leave.
That was one thing grandpapa was very nice
about; though he was so cold and strict, he
always trusted us, and never doubted our
words. I'm sure that is the best way to
make children quite truthful. Except that
one time I've told you of, I don't remember
any of us telling a story. It didn't seem
to come into our heads to do so       we had
been with grandpapa ever since we could
remember, and he had always been the same.
We had never known what it was to be
loved or petted, except by Liddy, for both
papa and mamma had died of a fever in
Spain, and we had been sent home with old
nurse. (I suppose I should have explained
this at the beginning; but it doesn't
matter.)

Well, I ran down to the library and went
straight to our own corner. They were
funny-looking books       mostly rather shabby,
for they had been children's books for two,
and some of them for three, generations.
It took me a little while to find the one I
was in search of; indeed, I wasn't quite
sure which it was, and I had to take out
several, and open them to see the page at
the beginning before I got the right one.
It was a small book; the name of it was
Ornaments Discovered, and on the first leaf
was written the name of the person it had
belonged to. There were two names, but
the first had been so scored through that one
could only distinguish the first letter of it,
which was "R," and the second name was
our name and grandpapa's name, "Ansdell."
And lower down on the page was the date,
and the name of a place just above it. But
this name also had been scored through,
only not so blackly as the other, so that it
was still easy to make out that it was that
of the house we were going to live at:
"Rosebuds."

I remembered it quite well now       I had
often puzzled over the writing in this book,
and though I had never made out the name
before, "Ansdell," I remembered having
read that the other was "Rosebuds." I
understood now a sort of feeling I had had
when grandpapa had told us the name that
morning, that I had heard it before       or, as
it turned out, seen it before.

I rushed up stairs with the little red book
in my hand.

"Tib," I said, looking and feeling very
excited, "just look at this."


  
    
      
      
    
  
  
    We leant over the book together.

Up jumped Tib       she had been down on
the floor arranging the primroses in some
little glasses that we always kept on the
mantelpiece for any flowers that came our
way. Liddy had left the room, and Gerald
had gone with her. We leant over the book
together.

"You see?" I said, pointing to the word
above the date.

"Yes," said Tib; "it's certainly 'Rosebuds.'
I suppose grandpapa had it when
he was a little boy, there."

"Oh, you stupid!" I exclaimed. "You're
always wanting to make up wonderful stories
of adventures and mysteries, and now, when
I've found you a real mystery, all ready
made, you won't see it. If it had just been
grandpapa's book, what would he have
scored the name out for? Besides, you
know very well that his name is 'Gerald,'
like papa and Gerald. And this name begins
with a 'R.'"

Tib had taken the book in her own hands
by this time, and was peering at it.

"You may call me stupid, if you like,"
she said, "but I've found out something
else. The name is 'Regina'       my second
name;" for Tib's whole name was Mercedes
Regina. "Mercedes Regina Ansdell"       isn't
that an awfully grand name for a little
girl? She was a little girl then.

I seized the book in my turn. Sure
enough, now that Tib had put the idea into
my head, it seemed quite plain       even
through the very thick crossing-out one
could see the confused shapes of the word
"Regina."

"You're right, Gussie," said Tib; "there
is a mystery. You remember that time that
grandpapa was grumbling at my name       like
he did this morning       and I said, 'Mightn't
I be called by my second name?' how
he snapped out, 'No, certainly not.' It
frightened me so, I remember. There must
have been somebody called 'Regina Ansdell'
that he didn't like, or he was angry with,
or something. Oh! how I do wonder who
she was, and why he has never told us
about her?"

"We might ask nurse," I said. "I am
sure she knows something       for you see, this
Regina Ansdell must have lived at Rosebuds,
and it's something about there that
Liddy has heard, and won't tell us. And I
shouldn't wonder if it has to do with grandpapa's
not wanting us to know any of the
people there."

"What can it be?" said Tib, her eyes
growing bigger and rounder. "There can't
surely be any one shut up there       a mysterious
lady called 'Regina.' Oh, no, that
can't be it, for grandpapa would never take
us there if there were. Besides       though
he's rather frightening and strict       grandpapa's
not bad and wicked."

"The Queen wouldn't let him be in the
Parliament if he were," said I. "At least,
I suppose not."

"It's good of him to have all of us living
with him. Nursey says it is. I don't think
we've got any money of our own."

"Well, we're his grandchildren, and it
isn't our fault that papa and mamma died,"
I said. "I don't think that's so very good
of him. Still, he is good to us in some
ways, I know."

Tib was still staring at the book.

"I don't think it's any use asking nurse,"
she said. "If she does know anything she
doesn't want to tell us. And it's no use
telling Gerald: he's too little. If we told
him not to speak of it, he'd very likely get
red the first time grandpapa looked at him       like
that day you filled the hood of Miss
Evans' waterproof with peas, and he kept
staring at it all the time of our lessons, till
she found out there was something the
matter."

"No," said I; "it's better not to tell
him. Of course, Tib, we mustn't do anything
naughty. It would be naughty to go
prying into grandpapa's secrets, if he has
any. But what we've found out hasn't been
with prying. It's impossible not to wonder
a little about it. And it's grandpapa's own
fault for telling us so sharply not to know
anybody or speak to anybody at Rosebuds.
Of course, we'll obey him, but we can't help
our minds wondering       they're made to
wonder."

Tib considered for a while. Then her
face cleared.

"I'll tell you what we can do, Gussie,"
she said; "we can turn it into a play. We
can't leave off wondering, as you say, but
we can mix up our wondering with fancy,
and make up a plan of how it all was. It
will be very interesting, for we shall know
there is something real, and yet we can
make it more wonderful than anything real
could be now that everything's grown so
plain and       and       I don't know the word       the
opposite of poetry and fairy stories,
I mean       in the world. We must think
about it, Gussie. We might make it
an 'ancient times' story, or an ogre story,
or              "

"Yes," I said, "we'll think about it."

I did not want to disappoint Tib, and I
thought, in a way, it was rather a good
idea. But I am not so fond of fancying or
pretending as Tib       I like real things. And
the idea of a real secret or mystery had
taken hold of my mind, and I wanted to
find out about it. Still, the making a play
of it wasn't a bad idea. As Tib said, it
would be more interesting than an altogether
make-up play.

We didn't say anything about the name in
the book to Liddy. It was no use worrying
the poor old thing by teasing her about what
she thought would be wrong to tell; even
if it had not anything to do with our
mystery, it would have been wrong and
unkind of us. And we said nothing to
Gerald either; and indeed for some days we
did not think or speak much about our discovery
even to each other; we were so very
much taken up about the real preparing to
go away.

It was much more of a nice bustle and
fuss than it had ever been to go to Ansdell
Friars. There, everything was left from
year to year just as we had always had it.
The rooms had all we needed, and there was
very little besides our clothes to pack up
and take. But for going to Rosebuds it
was quite different. None of the servants
had ever been there, and they were all in a
to-do about it, especially as only about half
of them were to go; and the other half
were cross at being sent away, and kept
telling the others they'd be sure to find
everything wrong there.

Nurse was the only one who was really
pleased to go; and I am sure, dear old thing,
it was more for our sakes than her own.

"It'll be a real change for them, poor
dears," she kept saying; and this gave her
patience to bear all our teasing and the
servants' grumbling. What a time she had
of it, to be sure! From Gerald's "Nursey,
may I take all my horses? If I leave Sultan
in the cupboard won't the mouses and
butterflies eat him?"       Gerald always called
moths butterflies       "Will there be any
wheelbarrows, like at Ansdell?" to Fanny's
suggestion that there'd be no nursery tea-service
there       "a house that nobody's been
in for years and years"       everything fell on
old Liddy! And you see she dared not go
asking grandpapa all sorts of things, as if
he'd been a lady. He was even rather cross
when she went trembling one day to ask if
there were shops anywhere near Rosebuds,
or if she must plan to take everything we
could want for all the summer.

"Shops," said grandpapa       I heard him,
for Liddy had caught him on his way down
stairs one morning, and I was standing just
inside the school-room doorway; "of course
there are shops near enough       five miles off
or so. I'm not going to take you to the
middle of Africa. I dare say there are shops
enough in the village for common things.
Mrs. Munt will tell you all that. No need
to worry me about it."

"Mrs. Munt!" I had never heard that
name before. I pricked up my ears, but I
was dreadfully afraid that Liddy would be
too frightened to ask any more. To my satisfaction
I heard her meek old voice again:

"And who may Mrs. Munt be, sir, if you
please?"

At this grandpapa stopped short and
looked at her       I couldn't see him, but I
felt him stop short and look at her. Poor
Liddy!

"Upon my soul!" he said. Then some
reflection seemed to strike him, for his next
words were more amiable.

"Mrs. Munt is the housekeeper at Rosebuds.
She's been there ever since I can
remember. You didn't suppose I was going
to trust to that Mary Ann's cooking?"
Mary Ann was the kitchen-maid. She was
coming with us, but not the cook, who was
leaving to be married. "Mrs. Munt is, or
used to be, a very good cook, and a very
good sort of person altogether."

"Oh, thank you, sir," said Liddy very
heartily. Mrs. Munt was a great relief to
her mind, for the idea of Mary Ann's cooking
on the days that "master" came down
to Rosebuds had been weighing on it. To
me the idea of Mrs. Munt brought back the
thought of the mystery. If she had been
there as long as grandpapa could remember,
what must she not know?

I flew off to Tib with the news,
but she did not receive it with much
interest.

"An old cook!" she said disdainfully.
"Why, that would spoil it all. It wouldn't
matter so much for an ogre story, if we
could fancy her a witch, but for an 'ancient
times' one, it would never do."

"Oh, bother!" I exclaimed, "I don't
want pretending. I want to know about
it really. If you only wanted make-ups,
you can always get things that will do for
them. I am sure Miss Evans would have
been a beautiful witch! Oh, Tib, aren't
you glad she isn't coming any more?"

For Miss Evans had left off coming altogether.
She was going to begin a school       how
we pitied the scholars!       and had asked
grandpapa to let her off at once. She came
to say good-bye to us, and gave us each a
present of a book       and, to our surprise,
there were tears in her eyes when she
kissed us! People are really very queer
in this world       they never seem to care for
things till they know they are not
going to have them any more. We all
felt rather ashamed that we couldn't cry
too, and Tib said she was afraid we must
have very little feeling, which made Gerald
and me quite unhappy for a while.

All the same, we weren't at all in a hurry
to hear of the new "Miss Evans."
      

      
CHAPTER III.
"ROSEBUDS."


"To one who has been long in city pent,
            'Tis very sweet to look into the fair
            And open face of heaven."
Keats' Sonnets.
      





 suppose it is
true, as older people
say, that things
very seldom turn
out as one expects.
Sometimes they are
not so bad as one
feels sure they will
be       and very often, or
almost always, they are
not so nice as one has thought they would
be, if one has been fancying and picturing
a great deal about them. And any way,
they are never quite what one expects. I
am beginning to find this out for myself
now       looking back, I can recollect very
few nice things in my life that have turned
out as nice as I had imagined them. But
of these few, Rosebuds was one, and that
has made me always remember with particular
distinctness all about our first acquaintance
with the dear little place. I
think I could tell everything about our
arrival there, exactly how each room looked,
and what we had for tea       oh, how hungry
we were that first evening! and I seem to
feel again the feeling of the snowy white
sheets and the sort of faint hay-ey       Tib
said it was lavender       scent in our beds
when we got into them that first night       very
tired, but very happy.

What plans we made for the next day       how
we settled to get up with the sun, to
ramble about and see everything       and how,
after all, we slept, of course, much later
than usual! Still, it was a delicious waking.
Do you know how beautiful a first waking
in the real country is when you have been
a long time in London? There is a sort of
clear stillness in the air that you can feel,
and then a cock crows       with quite a different
crow from the poor London cocks, I
always think, and hens cluck a little, just
under your window perhaps; or, best of all,
a turkey gobble-wobbles and some ducks
quack       perhaps there is a rush of all together
if your window happens to be not
far from the poultry-yard, and the girl is
coming out with the creatures' breakfast       and
further off you hear a moo from some
cows, and nearer, and yet more distant, the
clear sweet notes of the ever busy little
birds as they pass by on their way up to
who knows where? Oh, it is too delicious       and
when you
hear all those
sounds, as you are
lying there still dreamy
and sleepy, there is a
sort of strangeness and
fairy-ness       I must
make up that word       that
makes you think
of Red
Riding-hood
setting
off
in the
early
morning to her grandmother's cottage, or
of the little princess who went to live with
the dwarfs to keep house for them.

But I must come back to the evening
before       the evening, that is to say, of our
arrival at Rosebuds. It had been a pouring
wet day when we left London (it went on
pouring till we were only about half-an-hour
from our journey's end); and just at the
last moment grandpapa had got a telegram
which stopped his coming with us. He
grumbled a little, but I don't think he had
been looking forward with much pleasure to
the journey in our company, and though we
thought it our duty to look grave, and Tib
said gently, "What a pity!" I don't think
we minded much either. Indeed, to tell
the real truth       and it isn't any harm telling
it in here, as grandpapa will never see
this story       I think it was his not being
with us, and our feeling so lovelily free and
unafraid, that made that first evening at
Rosebuds so delightful.

And Mrs. Munt!       oh, yes, it had to do
with Mrs. Munt. There never was anybody
so nice as Mrs. Munt       there never could be!

But I must go straight on, and not keep
slipping a little bit backwards, and hurrying
on too far forwards, this sort of way.
Well then, as I was saying, it rained and
rained all through the three hours' journey,
or at least two hours and a half of it, so
that we all felt rather doleful and shivery,
and Liddy began hoping there'd be no
mistake about the carriage from the inn
meeting us at the station, as grandpapa had
told her it should. Poor Liddy was rather
inclined to get nervous when she was
thrown on her own resources.

"Never mind, nursey," we said, all three,
to comfort her; "we can easily walk if it
isn't there. You know grandpapa said it
was only about half a mile, and we've got
our big cloaks on       the rain wouldn't
hurt us."

But Liddy still looked rather unhappy,
till suddenly from her side of the railway
carriage Tib called out, "It's clearing up       it's
clearing up splendidly; and oh, Gussie!
do look       there's such a lovely rainbow!"

So there was. I never before or since
saw such a rainbow       it seemed a very nice
welcome for us, and after all, Liddy's fears
were quite without reason. For the queer
old "one-horse fly" was waiting for us, and
we all bundled into it and drove off without
any mishaps, except that nurse was sure
the packet of umbrellas had been left in the
railway carriage, and stood shouting to the
guard to stop after the train was already
moving out of the station, which made us
all laugh so, that we hadn't breath to tell
her that it was all safe in the fly.

Though Rosebuds is almost in the
village       at least, a very tiny bit out of
it       it is some little way from the station,
because for some reason that I've never
found out, the station stands away by itself
in the fields, as if it and the village had
quarrelled and wouldn't have anything to
say to each other. I dare say it's not a bad
thing that it is so: the nice country-ness
of it all would have been a little spoilt by
the trains whistling in and out, and as it is,
we scarcely hear it, as the railroad is low
down and is hardly noticed. And the road
from the station to the village is so pretty.
I never, even now, go along it without
remembering that first evening when we
drove to Rosebuds in the clear brightness
that comes after rain, the fields and the
hedges glistening with the water diamonds,
the little clouds hurrying away as if they
were afraid of being caught, and over all
the sort of hush that seems to me to follow
a regular rainy day       as if the world were a
naughty child that had cried itself to sleep
with the tears still on its cheeks.

It is a hilly bit of road       first it goes
down, and then it goes up, and when it
comes into the village it does so quite
suddenly. You see a high, ivy-covered
wall, which is the wall of the church-yard,
and then comes a row of sweet little alms-houses,
and then the inn, and one by one
all the village houses and shops in the most
irregular way possible. Some one said once
that it was more like an old German village
than an English one, but I have never been
in Germany, so I can't tell, only it certainly
is very unlike everywhere else. We were so
pleased to see it so queer and funny, that
we kept tugging each other to look out,
first at one side, and then at the other, and
sometimes at both at once. Then we began
wondering which of the houses, as we came
to them, could be Rosebuds, and I think
we would have been quite pleased whichever
it was       they all looked so tempting
and snug.

But we were all wrong in our guesses,
for, as I said, Rosebuds was quite at the
end, and, like the village itself, we came
upon it quite suddenly, turning sharply
down a sort of lane so shaded with trees
that you could scarcely see where you were
going; then with some tugging at the old
horse, and some swaying of the clumsy old
fly, in we drove at an open gate, and
pulled up in front of a low white house,
nestling, so to speak, in thickly-growing,
bushy trees.

Never was a house so like its name!
The trees were not really planted so very
close as they looked, but it seemed at first
sight as if it was almost buried in them:
it stood out so white against their green.
It looks at first sight smaller than it really
is, for it extends a good deal out at the
back. But large or small, to us it was just
perfection, and so was the very rosy old
woman who stood smiling and bobbing in
the porch. She was so comical-looking
that we could hardly help laughing. I
think she must find the world a very good-humoured
place, for nobody could be cross
when they look at her!

"Mrs. Munt, ma'am, I suppose?" said
nurse as she got down.

And, "Certainly, ma'am," replied Mrs.
Munt, and then the two old bodies shook
hands very ceremoniously. It was so funny
to see their politeness to each other. But
Mrs. Munt was too eager to see us to waste
much time on Liddy.

"And is these the dear young ladies and
gentleman?" she said, hastening forward
as we emerged from the fly. "Dear,
dear! to think you should be so big
already, and me never to have seen you
before!"

The tears were in her eyes, and we felt
rather at a loss what to say or do. She
seemed to know all about us so well that
we felt really ashamed to think       though it
certainly was not our fault       that we had
never heard of her till about two days ago.
I felt too shy to speak, but Tib held out
her hand.

"I am very glad to see you, Mrs. Munt,"
she said. "I am the eldest, you know. I
am Miss Ansdell."

A slight shadow of pain crossed the old
woman's face.

"Miss Ansdell," she repeated, with a
strange sadness in her tone: "yes, my
dear       to be sure       you are Miss Ansdell       Master
Gerald's eldest."

"I'm Gerald, too," said Gerald himself.
"I'm called after grandpapa and papa. Did
you know papa when he was as little as me?"

Mrs. Munt smiled.

"I should think so, indeed       and your
grandpapa too," she said. "And this is
Miss Gustava       you're not like the others,
my dear. Perhaps you take after your
mamma's family       the Ansdells have all
blue eyes and dark hair. I remember
Master Gerald writing about his lady's
beautiful light hair."

"Yes, indeed," said nurse, rather primly,
very anxious to put in a word for her side
of the house, "Miss Gussie's hair is very
nice, but it's nothing to what her dear
mamma's was."

But we didn't want to stand at the door
all the evening while the old bodies discussed
our looks in this way. Gerald, who
somehow seemed less shy with Mrs. Munt
than Tib and I, put a stop to it in his own
way.

"Mrs. Munt," he said, "I'm dreadfully
hungry. I'm only seven years old, you
know, though I look more; and nurse says
seven's a hungry age."

"And we're hungry too       Tib and I,
though I'm ten and Tib's eleven," said I.
"And we do so want to see all the rooms
and everything. Oh, I do think Rosebuds
is far the nicest place in the world."

My words quite gained Mrs. Munt's
heart.

"Indeed, miss, I don't think you're far
wrong," she said. And then, just for a
moment before going in, we stood and
looked round. In front of the house there
was a beautiful lawn, right down to the low
wall which separated it from the high road.
And away on the other side of that, the
ground sloped down gradually, so that we
seemed to have nothing to interfere with
the view, which was really a very lovely
one       right over the old Forest of Evold, to
where the river Rother flows quietly along
at the foot of the Rothering Hills. But
children don't care much for views       it's
since I've got big that I've learnt to like
the view       we were much more interested
to follow Mrs. Munt into the house, across
the low square hall into a short wide
passage, with a window along one side, and
a flight of steps at one end. A door stood
open close to the foot of the stairs, and
Mrs. Munt led the way through it into a
bright, plainly-furnished room, where tea
was already set out for us.

"I might have got it ready in the dining-room
this first evening," she said, "but I
thought master would be coming, and that
there'd be his dinner to see to. This is the
old play-room       the school-room as used to
be is now a bed-room       and I thought this
would be the best for you to have quite as
your own."

"It will be very nice, I'm sure," said Tib,
whom Mrs. Munt looked at as the eldest.
"And there's a door right out into the
garden       oh, that will be nice! won't it,
Gussie?"

"So that we can come out and in whenever
we like. Yes, I'm glad of that," I said.
"Is the garden big, Mrs. Munt? I hope it
is, because       because we've no chance of
being allowed to play in any other," I was
going to say, but I stopped, and I felt
myself grow a little red. I wondered if
Mrs. Munt knew why grandpapa was so
strict about our not making any friends;
and I fancied she looked at me curiously as
she replied       

"Yes, Miss Gustava; it's a good big
garden, and it's nice to play in, for there's a
deal of rather wild shrubbery       down at the
back. Our young ladies and gentlemen
long ago used to say there was nowhere like
Rosebuds for hide-and-seek."

"Who were your young ladies and gentlemen?"
I asked quietly. "Papa had no
brothers and sisters, I know."

"Ah! but I was here long before your
dear papa's time, Miss Gustava," said Mrs.
Munt. "I was here when your grandpapa
was a boy. I'm five years older nor master."

"And had grandpapa brothers and sisters,
then?" I asked again.

Mrs. Munt grew a little uneasy.

"You must have heard of your uncle, the
Colonel, who was killed in India," she said.
"And there was Miss Mary, who died
when she was only fifteen. You must have
seen her grave at Ansdell Friars."

I shook my head.

"No, I don't think so. But I do
remember the tablet in the church to Colonel
Baldwin Ansdell. I often wondered who
he was. You remember it, Tib? But
hadn't grandpapa any other sisters? You
said young ladies, Mrs. Munt."

I had forgotten all my shyness now in
curiosity. But it was not fated to be
satisfied just then. Nurse suddenly interrupted.

"Miss Gussie, dear, you must wait a
while to hear all these things from Mrs.
Munt. The tea's all ready, and I'm sure
you're all hungry. Just run up stairs with
Miss Tib to take off your hats, there's a
dear. Will you show us the rooms, Mrs.
Munt, please?"

So we were all trotted off again       up stairs
this time, though it scarcely seemed like
going up stairs at all, so broad and shallow
were the steps compared with the high-up
flights in our London house. And Tib and
I were so pleased with the room which Mrs.
Munt told us was to be ours, that we should
have forgotten all about the talk down stairs
if she hadn't made another remark, which
put my unanswered question into my head
again.

"Yes, it is a nice room," she said, looking
round with pleasure at the light-painted
furniture and the two white beds side by
side, the old-fashioned cupboards in the
wall, two of them with glass doors, letting
us see a few queer old china cups and teapots
inside; "and so little changed, even
to its name. We've always called it the
young ladies' room."

There it was again       the young ladies;
but nurse was listening and evidently fussing
to get us down to tea. I must trust
to cross-questioning Mrs. Munt some other
time.

And the tea was really enough to take
up all our attention. There was everything
of country things       fresh eggs, and butter
and milk of the best, and bread, and tea-cakes,
and strawberry jam, and potted fish       all
"home-made," of course. I think
Mrs. Munt and nurse were really a little
frightened to see how much we ate.

After tea we wanted, of course, to go out,
but Liddy decided that it was too damp,
and Mrs. Munt consoled us by giving us
leave to go all over the house, for it was
barely six o'clock and quite light. She took
us into the front hall and showed us the
dining-room, out of which opened the study,
and beyond that again, what had been the
school-room, and was now grandpapa's bed-room.
There was nothing very interesting
in these rooms, though they were all quaint
and old-fashioned; and through all the
house there was the sort of clean, fresh,
and yet not new feeling       a mixture of faint
old scents that cannot be got away, and
wood-fires long ago burnt out, and yet the
sweet, pure country air preventing their
being musty or stale       that you never notice
except in an old country house that has
been carefully kept, and yet not really lived
in for many years.

And then Mrs. Munt, taking us through
the hall again, showed us the door of the
drawing-room, and told us we might look
at it by ourselves, which we were pleased at.

It was much more interesting, for, though
a small room, it was filled with pictures and
curiosities. The pictures were mostly
miniatures       such queer things some of them
were; gentlemen in uniform and the funniest
fancy dresses, some with wigs down to their
waists, some of them with helmets to make
them like Roman soldiers. And ladies to
match       some looking dreadfully proud,
with towers of hair on the top of their heads,
and some simpering in a silly way. One of
these last was really rather like Tib when
she smiles in what I call her "company"
manner       though it's hardly fair to say that
now, as she has really left it off       and she
was very angry at my saying so, and told
me that the most stuck-up-looking one of
all was very like me; "and it's better to
look silly than to be so horribly proud," she
added. We were really rather near quarrelling,
which would have been a bad
beginning for our life at Rosebuds, when
we caught sight of an old cabinet in one
corner, of which the top half stood open,
showing rows and rows of little drawers,
and here and there queer shaped doors
opening into inside places, where there were
more drawers and shelves. It was a Japanese
cabinet, of course       a very old and valuable
one. I have never seen one so large and
curious, and it quite absorbed our attention
till nurse came tapping at the door       I don't
know why she tapped; I suppose she had
an idea that, as we were in the drawing-room,
she must       to tell us it was time, and
more than time, to go to bed.

And though I wanted to talk to Tib in
bed about the queerness of there having
been young ladies long ago in this very
room, and that Mrs. Munt evidently didn't
want to tell us about them, I was so sleepy,
and so was Tib, that our conversation got
no further than, "Tib, don't you think              "
and a very indistinct murmur of "Yes,
Gussie, of course I do," before we were both
fast asleep and              
      

      
CHAPTER IV.
THE DOOR IN THE GARDEN WALL.


"Deep in a garden, rank and green,
      It were scarce older now than then,
      For all the seasons gone between."
C. C. Fraser Tytler.
      





he next thing
we knew it
was to-morrow
morning       our
first morning at
Rosebuds!

I have told already
about this
first morning       how
beautiful it was to
wake to all the
fresh sweet country
sounds and feelings. I have felt this several
times since then in my life, but never quite
so newly and strongly as that morning,
and every time since then that I have felt
it, that day has come back to my mind.

It was very fine and bright, and immediately
after breakfast we got leave to go
out into the garden.

"Not outside, of course," said nurse,
anxiously. "When you want to go a
walk I will go with you       I or Fanny.
Mrs. Munt will tell us all the nicest
walks."

"We shall never want to go walks here,
I am sure," said Tib. "The garden is much
nicer, and we can find lots of things to
amuse us in it. Besides, nursey, you know
you don't care about walks with your
rheumatics, and Fanny is sure to say she
hasn't time, as she has to be housemaid too
here."

"It's much best to let us play in the
garden always," I said. "I'm sure grandpapa
would like it best."

"Any way, till the new Miss Evans
comes," said Gerald.

But Tib and I turned on him.

"Oh, you horrid little boy!" we said;
"what is the use of spoiling our nice
first day by speaking of anything so
dreadful?"

"I don't believe there ever could be anybody
at all like Miss Evans       that's one
comfort, any way," I added. But Gerald
looked rather grumpy: he couldn't bear
being called a "little boy"       he wouldn't
have minded being called "horrid" if we
hadn't put in the "little."

All grumpiness, however, was forgotten
when we found ourselves out of doors, and
free to do as we chose. This first day, of
course, the great thing to do was to explore,
and that we did pretty thoroughly. The
lawn in front was a beautiful place for
running races on, or for "Miller's ground,"
or games like that       and the walk all round
it was interesting because Mrs. Munt told
us that twelve times round it, made a
mile.

"We might have walking matches," said
Tib, consideringly. "It wouldn't be very
amusing; but still, if we got tired of everything
else, it would be worth remembering;"
and then we proceeded to inspect the rest of
our domain.

The place of places was the tangle, or
shrubbery, as Mrs. Munt had called it, away
down at the back. It was quite a large
place, and you could not distinguish easily
where it ended, for the wall which edged it
was so old, and so covered with ivy and
other creepers run wild, that till you
actually felt it you couldn't have told it
was there. Here and there in the tangle
there were little clearings, as it were, carefully
enough kept       indeed, the gardeners
did clear out the tangle itself once or twice
a year, only it was meant to be wild       where
you were sure to find a bench, or a
rustic seat, and in one place there was even
a summer-house, though a rather unhappy
looking one.

"I don't suppose," said Tib, when we
came upon this arbour, "I don't suppose
any one's been here since those children       grandpapa
and the brothers and sisters who
are dead, or that we can't hear about       played
here, ever, ever so long ago. Papa
hadn't any brothers or sisters, and he
wasn't much here       nurse knows that much.
It looks like as if it had never been touched
since then       doesn't it? Isn't it queer to
think of?" and Tib sat down on one of the
shady seats, still feebly holding together,
and looked very serious. "Isn't it queer?"
she repeated.

"It would be a nice place for a robber's
castle," said Gerald, who had mounted up
beside Tib, and was peeping out at a little
slit in the side which had been meant to let
light in by, in the days when the summer-house
had a door that would shut. "See
here, this hole would just do for an archer
to shoot through when he saw the       the
others you know," he went on, getting
rather muddled, "marching up the hill       we
could fancy it was a hill."

"Nonsense, Gerald!" I said. "You're
mixing up robbers' dens and feudal castles.
You're too little to plan plays. All you
can do is to be what Tib and I fix for you
in our plans."

Gerald was very indignant. He muttered
something about "just like girls," but he
dared not say it loud out; we kept him in
far too good order for that. Tib and I
went on talking without noticing him, and
he sat down in a corner, and amused himself
by poking about among the dry fir
needles that lay like a sort of sand on the
floor, for the arbour was made of fir branches
and cones. I remembered afterwards hearing
him give a sort of little squeak, and say,
"Hi! I declare!" or something like that,
but at the time I paid no attention, and he
stayed quite quiet in his corner.

His words, though I snubbed him so, had
reminded Tib of her plans, and we went on
talking about them for some time. She
was all for a regular romance       there was to
be a beautiful lady shut up by a cruel
baron, who wanted to get all her money by
forcing her to marry his hump-backed son
(I am afraid that among the old children's
books, one or two not quite children's books
had got in; I remember one, called "The
Imprisoned Heiress," which we read a
chapter or two of, and then it got stupid),
and she was to escape by "scaling the
fortress wall," which meant, we had a hazy
idea, stripping it down stone by stone, as if
it were a fish with scales. We decided that
the summer-house would do very well for
the lonely tower, and we sallied forth at
last, all three of us, to inspect the wall and
choose a good place for the imaginary escape.
But time had fled faster than we fancied;
we had only gone a few steps, when we
heard Fanny's voice in the distance.

"Miss Tib, Miss Gussie, Master Gerald!
Master Gerald, Miss Gussie, Miss Tib! oh,
dear, dear, wherever can they be? Your
dinner's ready       din       ner! din       ner!" she
went on at last, as if she thought the word
"dinner" would be the best bait to catch
us by.

We were rather hungry again already.
We all set up a shout, and set off in a
scamper to where Fanny stood, the image
of despair, at the beginning of the tangle,
which she dared not enter in her thin
London slippers, as the moss-grown paths
looked damp and dirty.

That afternoon, to our vexation, was
showery       it was not so hopelessly rainy as
to prevent our going out at all, but nurse
told us we must stay in the front, on the
short-cropped lawn and the dry gravel paths.

So it was not till the next day that we
returned to the old summer-house and the
tangle. We had, in the meantime, talked
over the plan of the play, and got it more
into shape. You will see that it had
nothing to do with the "mystery," as Tib
and I still called it to ourselves. We had
decided to wait a little before playing at it.
I did not care for Gerald to hear about it,
for fear he should chatter to nurse, and I
also wanted to see if there really was anything
else to find out. There was no knowing
but what in time Mrs. Munt would tell
us more about the family history, and
though Tib was rather reluctant to give up
making a story of it, I persuaded her that
so far we really knew too little.

We began cleaning out the summer-house,
for I wanted to make it habitable for the
unfortunate heroine.

"You see," said I, "it would be more
natural for the cruel baron to persuade her
that he was bringing her here for safety, as
he had heard his castle was going to be
attacked by some enemy; so he makes it
pretty comfortable for her. And then,
when she's been living here alone for some
time, and she must be finding it very dull,
he sends the horrid little hump-back, who
pretends to be against his father, and tells
her she is going to be kept there unless
she'll marry him, and that he is dreadfully
sorry for her, and              "

"I don't see why he need pretend to be
against his father," said Tib; "he might
just say straight off that she must marry
him or else she'll never get out. But I
think it would be much better to fancy it
was a horrid dungeon. Gerald, I don't
think you need trouble to rake up the cones
and leaves into a bed for her. I don't see
any sense in pretending it's comfortable."

"I do       and it makes it much more of a
play," I said. "Any way, we might make
it that way at first, and have her thrown
into the dungeon afterwards, and escape
from there."

Tib did not object to this. But the word
"escape" reminded her of the wall. She
proposed that we should examine it, and
find the best place.

We had to scramble in among the bushes
before we got to the wall. And it proved
to be a much higher one than we expected.

"The play will have to be all pretence,"
said Tib; "we couldn't possibly get over
this, or pull any stones away. It is far
too strong."

We went on, however, a few steps, still
at the foot of the wall. Suddenly Tib gave
a little exclamation.

"Look here, Gussie," she said, and with
her hands she pulled back some branches of
ivy       "look here       there's a door in the
wall       a very old door, and not opened for
ever so long; for see, the ivy has grown
right across it."

Gerald and I pushed forward eagerly.
Yes, Tib was right. There was a door in
the wall       not a very big one, but very strong,
for it did not rattle or shake at all when we
pounded on it. It was locked, firmly locked
we soon found out, when we had torn away
as much of the ivy as we could. The lock
was a great big one, clumsy, but very
strong, and so rusty that, even without the
testimony of the ivy, it would have been
clear that no one had passed through that
doorway for a great number of years.

We all three stood and looked at each
other.

"Another mystery," was what Tib and I
were thinking, though we did not say it aloud.

But Gerald looked rather "funny;" his
round rosy cheeks were rosier than usual, and
there was a queer sparkle in his eyes as he
said       

"Wouldn't you like to open it? Wouldn't
it be nice if one could find the key?" and
he jumped about and turned       or tried to
turn       head over heels: there wasn't much
room in among the bushes, and he kept
saying, "Wouldn't it be nice if somebody
could find a key to fit it? But little boys
are too little and silly to know anything,
aren't they? They're not like big young
ladies."

And though Tib got hold of him, and we
both shook him we were so provoked, that
was all he would say. So we settled that
he was just in one of his teasing humours;
he didn't have them very often, it is true.

So the only use to make of the door in
the wall was another pretence. We settled
that it should be the entrance to the dungeon;
it didn't do badly for that, as two or
three steps, looking very black and slimy,
led down to it. And we fixed that, instead
of "scaling the wall," the lady should
escape by hiding in the wood till the prince
who was to be her rescuer passed that way.
Gerald had to be the prince, in turns with
the horrid little hump-back, for I had to
be the baron, and also a lady attendant on
the heiress, and Tib, of course, was the
heiress. We didn't much like having Gerald
after the tiresome way he had been going
on, but there was no help for it.

And the next two or three days passed
very happily. There was still a great deal
to see and inspect about Rosebuds; the
house itself       especially the drawing-room,
with its treasures, which Mrs. Munt showed
us, and sometimes, when she found that we
were careful children, allowed us to examine
for ourselves; the stables, where lived the
old pony who was still able to draw the still
older pony-carriage, or "shay"       as the
farm-man called it       as far as the little town,
where Mrs. Munt liked to go once a month,
and to bring home her purchases herself instead
of trusting them to the railway. Then
there were the dairy and poultry-yard,
her great pride, though she was rather
mortified to hear that we had never known
that the butter and fresh eggs we ate in
London were sent up from Rosebuds every
week.

"Why, we never even heard of Rosebuds
till a few days before we came here," I told
her.

Her face grew sad at this, and I was sorry
I had said it.

"Grandpapa is very funny," I went on,
thinking, perhaps, we might get round to
the subject of the "young ladies" and the
scored-out name, which we couldn't help
connecting together; "he never tells us
anything. I don't believe he'd have ever
told us we'd had a papa and mamma if nurse
hadn't been our mamma's nurse, and so could
tell us all about her."

"Your grandpapa's had a deal of trouble,
my dears," said Mrs. Munt. "And there's
some as trouble softens and makes more
loving to all about them and some as it
hardens, or seems to harden, leastways to
shut them up in themselves. And I think
it's no harm of me to tell you, now I see
what sensible children you are, that it's been
that way with your grandpapa. It's not
really hardened him, for you know he has
not got selfish or unmindful of others. He
is very good to you?" and poor Mrs. Munt
made the question anxiously, as if half afraid
of what we might answer.

"Nurse says he's very good to us," said
Tib, slowly. "He gives us everything we
have."

"But it isn't our fault that we are his
grandchildren," I said, rather bitterly. "We
didn't ask to be it. And he has plenty of
money       what could he do with it if he
hadn't us?"

"Gussie," said Tib, reproachfully. But
old Mrs. Munt only looked distressed, not
vexed.

"He does love you, my dears: I feel sure
of it," she said. "Only he's got out of the
way of showing it       that's what's wrong.
If you had your grandmamma now, or              "
and then she stopped. "A lady       a woman
in the family makes all so different. But
try, my lovies, to believe that he does love
you. It is true, as Miss Gussie says       for
I'd never be one to say to children what
their own sense feels is nonsense       that it
would be very wrong of your grandpapa not
to give you all you should have. You're
his own flesh and blood, for sure. Still, he
might have done it in a different way       he
might have sent you to some sort of school,
or to some lady who'd have taken care of
you all, and him have no trouble about it.
No one would have thought it unnatural if
he'd done that way, instead of taking up
house again in London, when he'd got quite
out of the way of it, and settling all so that
he should have you always near him."

We both looked surprised.

"Did he do that?" we said.

"Yes," said Mrs. Munt, "he did indeed;
and much more that he didn't, so
to speak, need to have done       without, all
the same, having fallen short of his duty."

"I wish he would tell us things like that,"
I said. "How are we to know?"

"No," said Tib, "not quite that. I think
it seems more for his not telling. But I
wish       I wish he'd let us feel that he loves
us, and then we would, indeed we would,
love him;" and some tears slowly made their
way into Tib's blue eyes.

"Well, well, dears, that's the right way
to feel, any way. And maybe things will
change somehow. It's wonderful how things
come round when people really mean right.
So keep up heart, and don't be afraid of
letting master see that you want to please
him, and to love him too."

This talk with the old housekeeper made
a great impression on us       so great that it
almost put the mystery out of our heads
altogether. For a great deal seemed explained
by the thought of grandpapa's old
troubles, and what these had been in time
past we knew quite well. He had lost so
many dear to him. Grandmamma, to begin
with, had died quite young; then there was
the brother Baldwin, killed in India, and the
sister Mary, buried at Ansdell Friars. That
was sad enough       and then his only son
to have died too, leaving us three helpless
babies.

"I dare say he'd just as soon have been
without us, and have had nobody at all
belonging to him," I said to Tib. "It
must have been a great nuisance to have
us stupid little things sent home, and not
even poor mamma to take care of us. Do
you remember, Tib, how we used to cry
and run back to nurse when he sent for us
down to the library to see him? We
thought him a sort of an ogre."

A few days after this talk with Mrs.
Munt, grandpapa came down to Rosebuds
from a Saturday to a Monday. We weren't
exactly glad to see him, but what the old
housekeeper had said was fresh in our
minds, and we were all anxious to do our
best to please him. So we made no objection
when nurse called us a full hour before
he could possibly arrive, "to be made neat
against your dear grandpapa comes." Poor
old Liddy       she would have thought it her
duty to call him our dear grandpapa even if
he had been an ogre, I do believe!

And we had worked ourselves up to
being so extra good, that we did not even
grumble at the long time we had to sit
still doing nothing on the window-seat in
the hall, watching, or listening rather, for
the first rumble of the carriage wheels as
the signal for all running out into the
porch to meet him. That part of it was
a "plan" of Tib's       everything with her
was sure to run into "plans," and with this
new idea of pleasing grandpapa, she was
constantly casting about in her head what
we could do.

"I think seeing us standing together in
the porch will touch him, you see, Gussie,"
she said. "It is a little like some scene
I've read of in a story-book       the orphans,
you know       oh, where was it?       and the stern
guardian, and it quite melts him, and              "

"He begins to cry, I suppose," I said,
rather contemptuously, I fear; "I must
say I'd be a good deal astonished to see
grandpapa begin to cry over us, wouldn't
you, Gerald?"

But the idea was quite beyond Gerald's
imagination.

"I do wish one thing," he said solemnly.

"What?" asked Tib and I eagerly.
When Gerald had an idea, it was rather
startling.

"If he       grandpapa, you know       really
wished to please us       he might be thinking
of us on the journey, you know       wouldn't
it be beautiful if he was to bring us each
a packet of that splendid butter-scotch that
there was at the station in London? I
looked at it while we were waiting. I
really could love him if he did."

"You greedy little pig!" said Tib.

It wasn't often Tib condescended to use
such expressions, but no doubt Gerald's
butter-scotch seemed rather a come-down
from her romantic ideas. I was sorry for
her, but I couldn't help laughing at the
look of disgust in her face, and at Gerald's
face of astonishment. He muttered something
I couldn't hear       of course there was
something about "girls," and "sha'n't get
it out of me," which I didn't understand.
But Tib's indignation next fell upon
me.

"How can you laugh at him       such low
ideas," she said, reproachfully, to which I
answered rather crossly. Indeed, we were
all on the verge of a quarrel when at last
the sound of wheels turning in at the gate
was heard, and up we all jumped.
      

      
CHAPTER V.
WHAT GERALD FOUND.


"Give a little love to a child, and you get a great deal
back."       Ruskin.
      





t was very funny, after
all poor Tib's great
preparations, when she
really saw grandpapa
that she seemed as if
she could say nothing.
I had already run
forward, and quite without
thinking of pleasing him, or
of anything except that I was awfully glad
he was there, because I was so tired of
sitting still and squabbling, I called out
quite loudly       

"Oh, grandpapa, I am so glad you've
come!"

He was just getting down from the dog-cart       he
had had it and a horse and groom
sent down to Rosebuds to be ready for
taking him to and from the station; the
old one-horse fly wouldn't have suited
grandpapa, I can assure you!       and when
he heard me he turned round with quite a
nice, not the least "making-fun-of-you,"
smile on his face. I don't think I had
ever before seen his face look so nice.
"Are you really glad I have come, Gussie?
I'm sure I feel very flattered."

I felt both pleased and vexed. I did so
wish I could have let him go on thinking
I meant it that way, and I felt myself
getting very red as I blurted out       

"Yes, grandpapa, I am       we are all glad
you've come. But I meant, perhaps, partly
that we've been dressed and waiting for you
such a time, and we were all getting rather
cross."

A slight look of disappointment       it was
really disappointment, and it made me feel
still more sorry       crossed grandpapa's face
at my words. Then he smiled again, but
this time I was sorry to see there was a
little of the old smile in it.

"You are candid, at least, my dear
granddaughter. Ah, well! we must take
the goods the gods send us, and not expect
impossibilities, I suppose! And that any
one should be glad to see me, in the
ordinary acceptation of the words, comes
within that category, naturally."

He used such long words, he puzzled
me. (I must tell you that I have been
helped here and there to write things that
grandpapa said by some one who knows
quite well his sort of way, otherwise I
couldn't have got it quite right, though
I remember it all in my own way.) I
looked up and said, "Grandpapa, I don't
understand you."

Then his face grew nicer again, and he
stooped down to kiss us in his usual
way, saying to me as he did so, "Never
mind; such understanding comes soon
enough."

And Tib, who, I suppose, had been
gathering courage all this time, then looked
up, and said very prettily       Tib is very
pretty, you know, and that makes what
she says pretty too, I think       

"Grandpapa, perhaps we could understand
some things       nice things       better
than you think. We do understand that
you're very good to us       it was very good
of you to let us come here. We are so
happy!"

Grandpapa put his hand under Tib's chin,
and raised her face so that he could see
straight into her blue eyes.

"Has any one been putting that into
your head, Mercedes?" he said, almost
sternly. "The truth, now, child       for
Heaven's sake let me see if you are true!
Can she be with those eyes       those very
same eyes?" he added to himself, so low
that no one but I       for I have dreadfully
quick ears       heard it. Tib didn't; she told
me so afterwards, but that was perhaps
because she was thinking so what she
should answer. But she looked up fearlessly,
and she didn't get red.

"Mrs. Munt has been speaking to us
very nicely, grandpapa," she said. "But
she didn't tell me to say anything to you       oh
no, grandpapa. All she did was to
make us think perhaps better than we
have ever done before how very good you
are to us;" and then, with the last words
Tib's courage began to go away, and the
tears came welling up into her eyes.

Grandpapa looked at her still for a
minute, and then he said quietly       

"What I do is no more than you have
a right to. Still, at your age the less
thought about rights       and wrongs too       the
better, no doubt. And so you are
happy here?"

"Very," we all replied, heartily. And
then Gerald       oh, that tiresome boy!       must
needs add       

"And it is so nice without Miss
Evans!"

Grandpapa laughed at this, really
laughed; but Tib and I could have
pinched Gerald. For, alas! grandpapa
added       

"That's right       not to have let me forget
about finding a new Miss Evans;" and
if he saw       which I don't know       Tib's and
my faces when he said that, he must have
been satisfied that we could look what we
felt very candidly.

Grandpapa only stayed two days; but
his visit was really much nicer than we
had fancied it would be. He took us to
church on Sunday himself. But, rather
to our disappointment, not to the pretty
old church we had passed on first entering
the village, but to one at least three miles
off, which was not at all pretty nor interesting.
There was nobody at all there
except very stupid-looking, poor country
people, and the sermon was very long, and
the clergyman very dull and stupid himself.
To be sure, the driving there and
back in the dog-cart a little made up for it;
but still, we were very vexed when grandpapa
said we were to come to this church
every Sunday, if it was fine, in the dog-cart,
Tib in front beside Reeves the groom,
and me behind with nurse, and Gerald
stuck in beside Tib; and if it was rainy, in
the old fly from the inn in the village.

We heard grandpapa giving these orders
to Reeves on the way home.

"Oh, grandpapa!" I said       I was sitting
on the back seat, so I felt more courageous,
I suppose       "must we go every Sunday to
that stupid little church? I'm sure the one
in the village is much nicer."

"Have you been there?" said grandpapa,
very sharply.

"No, grandpapa," I replied; "we've
not been anywhere at all in the village.
But we saw the church the day we
came."

"Then you cannot possibly know anything
about it; and if you were even
capable of having an opinion, it would
not make the slightest difference to mine,"
he said, in his very horridest cold
way.

But he got nicer again after a bit. He
even took us a little walk with him in
the afternoon, round a very pretty way,
going away down the lane into which the
gate of Rosebuds opens, and into some
woods and copsey sort of places that were
awfully nice. Grandpapa was very quiet,
and didn't speak much; but he wasn't
sharp or catching up. Once or twice he
stood still, and looked about him with an
expression on his face I had never seen
there before, and he said to us       

"I remember these woods       every tree
in them, I believe       as long as I remember
myself;" and then he gave a little sigh.

"Do you really, grandpapa?" we said.
"Won't you tell us a little about when
you were a little boy?"

"Can you remember so long ago? Was
it as much as a hundred years ago?"
asked Gerald, opening his mouth very
wide.

"Not quite so long       but too long
ago to tell you stories about," he replied,
and then he walked on without
speaking.

Grandpapa had taken us an in-and-out
sort of way       we hadn't exactly noticed
where we were going, and we were surprised
to find ourselves suddenly quite
near home again. We had come up another
lane, on the other side of Rosebuds,
as it were; this lane was skirted by a
high stone wall, a wall that looked something
like the one that bordered our
"tangle."

"Is inside there our garden, then?"
asked Tib, for grandpapa had just said
to us we were close to home.

"No," said grandpapa, but without looking
in the direction she pointed, "that is
not the Rosebuds' garden yet."

"Then what's behind there, please?"
said Gerald, in his slow way. I didn't
expect grandpapa to take the trouble of
answering him, but he did.

"There is another garden behind there,"
he replied, "the garden of another house,
that is to say. But it is a house that has
been uninhabited for a great number of
years       the garden must be a perfect wilderness
by now       the place is going to be sold
immediately, and the house pulled down
most likely, or else turned into a mere
farmhouse       the owner of the farm over
there," and he pointed over our heads,
"wants to buy it. So much the better."

There was a sort of dreaminess in the
way grandpapa spoke, as if his thoughts
were looking back somehow far beyond
his words.

"May we play in that garden if there's
nobody there?" asked Gerald.

"Why should you want to play there?"
said grandpapa. "It does not belong to
me."

"And I'm sure we couldn't have a nicer
garden than our own, and it's very big
too," said I.

"We may go anywhere we like in our
garden, mayn't we?" said Gerald.

"Yes," said grandpapa.

"And if we could get through the door
in the wall, we might, mightn't we?"
Gerald continued in his slow, drawly way.
He speaks better now, but then he had a
way of going on once he began, all in the
same tone so that you really hardly noticed
that he was talking. I have thought since
that grandpapa didn't in the least know
what he was consenting to, when for the
second time he replied "yes."

Gerald would have gone on, no doubt,
but Tib interrupted him.

"Does that door lead into a tool-house,
grandpapa?" she said. Her voice was soft
and gentle. It was only I that had a quick,
sharp way of speaking.

"A tool-house?" repeated grandpapa,
"oh, yes, I fancy so." He must have
thought that Tib was asking him if there
was a tool-house in the garden.

"Oh," she said in a rather disappointed
tone. There wasn't much mystery about
a tool-house!

Just then the lane stopped, and we came
out on a path bordered by a field on one
side, and on the other by a wall which was
that of our own garden. Very near the
foot-path in the field lay two or three
ponds or pools of water close together, and
on one of them floated some large leaves
looking like water-lily leaves, with some
bushy high-growing green among them.
Tib darted forward.

"Oh, look, Gussie," she said, "there'll be
the most lovely water forget-me-nots here
in the summer, and       " But she stopped
short in a fright, for grandpapa had caught
her by the arm and was pulling her back.

"Child, take care," he said sharply,
"another minute, and you would have
been in the water. The edge is as slippery
as glass. If the field were mine, I would
soon have these pits filled in," he went on,
looking round as if he wished there were
some one at hand to give the order to on
the spot.

"But they are such little pools, grandpapa,
they don't take up much room," I
objected, "and if there were water-lilies,
and forget-me-nots there in the summer,
it would be a dreadful pity to take them
away."

"And when the lilies and forget-me-nots
come out, what is more likely than that you
or Mercedes should be stretching over to
get them and fall in," said grandpapa.

"But if we did it wouldn't hurt us," said
I. "If Tib fell in, I would pull her out,
and if I fell in, she would pull me out."

"And if both Tib and Gussie fell in I
would pull them both out," said Gerald,
feeling, I suppose, that he had been left
rather out in the cold.

Grandpapa, who had been poking at
the back of the pit with his stick, turned
sharp round upon us. "Children," he said,
"listen to me. If one of you, or two of
you, or all of you fell into one of those
ponds, you would be drowned       as certainly
as that I am standing here, you would be
drowned. They are very, very deep       there
would be no chance of saving you, far less
than in a larger piece of water, even if it
were as deep. I cannot have the pits
filled up nor railed round, for the place
does not belong to me, and I cannot ask
anything of the person it does belong to.
All I can do is to make you promise       to
make you give your word of honour, if you
know what that means       that you will never
come here alone, and never try to reach
flowers; if you come this way with
nurse, you must pass by as quickly as
possible. Now, do you hear? Do you
quite understand? Have I your promise?"

We all stood still, looking and feeling
rather frightened.

"Do you promise?" repeated grandpapa.

"Yes, grandpapa," we all said together,
"we do promise."

"That's right," he said, and then we all
walked on in silence. Grandpapa's earnestness
had impressed us. I think the same
thought was in all our minds: "He must
love us, after all, or he would not be so
afraid of our being drowned." I don't think
we had ever felt ourselves of so much consequence
before.

"Was ever anybody drowned in those
pools, please, grandpapa?" I ventured to ask.

"Not that I know of," he said; "but
two or three cows have been drowned there.
The place is exceedingly dangerous       it is a
shame to leave it so. I shall speak to
Farmer Blake about it when he comes into
possession."

Then we went in to tea, and early the
next morning grandpapa went back to
London.

But oh! I am forgetting       before he went
he told us another thing. Our holidays
were over already. He had found us
another Miss Evans! No; I am joking.
It was not quite so bad as that. He couldn't
find another Miss Evans, so he had had to
make another plan. We were to have a
tutor instead of a governess; and I don't
think we were sorry to hear it. The tutor
was a young man living in the town, two
stations from our station, and he was to
come every morning, except Saturday, for
two hours. That wasn't so bad, was it?
He wasn't to come before half-past ten, so
we could have an hour and a half's play in
our dear garden before he came, and all the
afternoons to ourselves; for we were quite
sure we could do all the preparing of our
lessons in the evening, and grandpapa had
always been very sensible about not wanting
us to have too many lessons to do.

It turned out very well. Mr. Markham
began to come that very week, but he was
really very nice, and he didn't give us too
much to do, though what he did give was
pretty hard, for he would have it done
very well. Only when we did try he was
pleased, and told us so. But of course we did
not see very much of him, as he was very busy
at his home, and he had to leave as soon as
ever lessons were over, to get back in time.

We went on with our fancy play in the
tangle. In the mornings it was hardly worth
while beginning it, for if you have ever
played at that sort of game you will know
that it needs a comfortable feeling of plenty
of time before you can get into it properly.
We should have liked to dress up a little
for it, but nurse wouldn't let us do so till
the weather was warmer, and we were
obliged to promise her never to take off our
hats and jackets in the garden for fear of
catching cold. We were more in danger of
"catching hot," Gerald told her, for we
really worked pretty hard, particularly at
getting the summer-house into order. We
got some nails and a hammer from Mrs.
Munt, and hammered the broken seats
together again; we fastened on the door
rather cleverly by making hinges of an old
leather belt of Gerald's, and we put up one
or two shelves on the walls, as we called
them, on which the princess, or heiress       we
called her sometimes one, and sometimes
the other       could keep her tea-cups and
saucers in her tower. These tea-cups and
saucers were the remains of an old toy set,
which Mrs. Munt had found and given us
to play with       no doubt, Tib and I said to
each other, the "young ladies" had played
with them long ago!

Then we "carted" heaps of dry leaves
from one corner, where they were really dry
and not sodden, to make a bed for her.
This carting was an uncertain sort of business,
for we had to be content with Gerald's
wheelbarrow, which was painfully low and
little, except when we could get hold of the
gardener's standing about. And his was,
on the contrary, disagreeably heavy and
big. But at last, one fine afternoon we
came to an end of our
labours, and stood surveying
them with considerable
satisfaction.

"It really looks quite
nice and comfortable,"
Tib said. "I
really think
to-morrow the baron may carry her off to
the tower       he's to pretend, you know, to be
only taking her out a walk in her litter."

"A walk in a litter," I said; "why, a
litter's a lying-down-in thing, and we
haven't got anything the least like one."

"Well, then, a walk on her feet," said
Tib, testily; "that did very well the other
day," for you must understand that we
had acted it all several times, and then
we found what was wanting in the way of
scenery,      c.

"If only we had the dungeon," she went
on. "It's a very poor pretence to call
those steps the dungeon       besides, they're
horribly damp and dirty."

"Oh, for that part of it, all the better," I
said. "Dungeons always are damp and
dirty."

"But my frock?" said Tib, ruefully.
"I can't sit down on those steps without
getting it horribly spoilt. If we could but
get into the tool-house!"

Gerald, who was standing beside us       we
were close to the door in the wall       gave a
sudden exclamation and darted off. Tib
and I looked at each other in surprise.
"What's the matter with him?" we said.
But he was back again in a moment, holding
something in his hand. As he came
near us he put both his hands behind his
back.

"I've got something," he said. "I'd
forgot about it. It was the day you teased
me I found it. And I hid it, and I was
afraid it was lost among the leaves, and all
that, but it wasn't. I'd hidden it safe.
Guess what it is."

We tried, but we couldn't. Gerald raised
his hand slowly. "Shut your eyes," he
said; and we shut them. "Now open
them;" we opened them. "What is it?"
we said, breathlessly.

"The key of the door!" he said, solemnly.

"The key of the tool-house!" exclaimed
Tib. "How do you know it is it? Where
did you find it?"

"I found it among the prickly things on
the floor of the summer-house," he replied.
"It's quite dry and clean, see!" and so it
was, as if it had been packed in sawdust.

"But how do you know what key it is?"
we asked.

"I tried it       I stayed behind a minute
that day; you didn't notice. It is the key.
It fits pairfittly," said Gerald. "Only it's
very stiff, and my hands wasn't quite strong
enough. If we all try, perhaps."

He put the key into the lock. Yes, it
was evident it was the key, lost for who
knows how many years. How queer that
no one had ever had another made; there
was another tool-house, and one was enough,
perhaps. But still, it did seem queer. First
Tib, then I, tried to turn it, but it was
no use.

"If we put a stick through the end of
the key, we might turn it that way."

"But it might break it; don't you
remember we broke the nursery door key
in London by trying to turn it with a
tooth-brush handle?" I said. "It wants
oiling, Tib       that's it; not the key, perhaps,
but the lock. We must wait till to-morrow,
and get some oil in one of the doll's cups,
and a feather, and then I'm sure it'll do.
But what a bother to have to wait till
to-morrow!"

There was no help for it, however. Wait
till to-morrow we must.
      

      
CHAPTER VI.
OPEN, SESAME.


"I know thee not; but well my heart
      Interprets, darling, what thou art;
      Light of some old ancestral hall,
      Queen-gem of some proud coronal!
      For, certes, such a perfect grace,
      Such lustrous loveliness of face,
      Such artless majesty as thine
      Proclaims thee of no sordid line!"
      The Unknown Portrait       Sir Noel Paton.
      





here was time
the next morning,
before Mr.
Markham came,
for coaxing a little
oil out of Mrs. Munt,
and fetching a feather
from the poultry-yard,
but for no more.
For Mrs. Munt, kind
as she was, very naturally objected to
giving us the oil in one of the best tea-cups,
which Gerald had brought for the
purpose, thinking it must be "an old
one," which it was indeed, though not in
his sense of the word. So Tib ran off to
the princess's tower for one of the doll ones,
and Gerald and I went in the other
direction for a long feather. And by the
time that we were ready for operations, it
was within a quarter of an hour of lessons,
and being rather sensible children in some
ways       we had early learnt experience and
responsibility in our own affairs, having no
one to advise or arrange for us in such
matters       we decided it was better to wait
till we were sure of plenty of, and uninterrupted,
time.

"You see, if Fanny came shouting for us
just as we had got into the tool-house, she
might see it, and it would be no longer a
private place of our own; we must keep it
quite for our own," I said.

"Certainly," said Tib. "You know I
asked grandpapa about it, and he didn't
seem to mind."

But lessons that morning did go very
slowly. Once or twice Mr. Markham had
to call us to attention, and there was even
a slight threat on his part of "extra work
to be done for to-morrow," if the rest of
our preparation should not prove better
done. It was not the fault of the preparation       which
had been done as well as
usual       it was that our heads were all agog
over the tool-house! But we pulled up
after this, and things ended fairly well.

And at last       though not till after our
dinner, for we were never allowed more
than "a run," and that well within view of
the schoolroom window, between lessons
and dinner       we found ourselves again in
safety before the door in the wall       oil-cup
and feather in hand.

We set to work methodically       with the
help of nurse's largest scissors and a
skewer       how Gerald had got the skewer I
don't know: we raked out all the little bits
of dirt and rubbish that had collected in
the lock; then we oiled it as thoroughly as
we knew how, though under the circumstances
this was certainly a process of
working in the dark. Then we carefully
inserted the key       it went in to perfection,
but we all looked at each other, and grew
hot with excitement when it came to the
moment for trying to turn it.

Tib as the eldest had the first try       a
barren honour; she hurt her hands over
it, but it would not move       not a hair's
breadth! Then it came to me. I have
larger hands than Tib, and stronger
muscles; I fancy I set to work in a more
business-like manner. With me the key
turned       with groans and grunts, it must
be allowed       but still it turned       half-way!
then I too looked blank. Fortunately it
did not refuse to turn back again, and then
I took it out and looked at it reproachfully.

Gerald laid hands on it. It was his turn,
but what I had failed in, it was not likely
his little, fat, stumpy paws would achieve.
But Gerald is sharp in some ways. He
first examined the key all over. Then he
took up the oily feather again.

"See here," he said, "some parts of the
key are quite oily, but some, inside, are
quite dry. We should have oiled the key
as well as the lock."

He was right; his small grasp did what
ours had failed in. Grunting and groaning
still, but forced to obey, the old key woke
from its sleep of thirty or forty years and
did the work it was made for. And in
another minute we had tugged at the door
till it moved on its rusty hinges       you will
understand afterwards how they came to be
no rustier       slowly opening and revealed       

What did it reveal? For a few minutes
we were too dazzled to tell       really dazzled       as
well as amazed. A perfect flood of light
seemed to pour out upon us, and instead of
the dingy, musty tool-house we had been
expecting, we found ourselves standing at
what at first sight appeared like the entrance
to some fairy palace of brightness and brilliance.
We stood, dazed, rubbing our eyes
and looking at each other. Was it magic?
Had we chanced upon some such wonder of
old world times as our little heads were
stuffed with? Tib       and Gerald too, perhaps       would
have been ready to believe it. Had
the door there and then shut upon us, leaving
us but the remembrance of the vision,
they would have lived upon beautiful fancies
for the rest of their lives. But I       practical
I       did not long stand bewildered. A slight
creak of the door brought me back to common-place.

"Come inside, quick!" I said, pulling at
the others       we were all huddled together
on the steps       "shut the door, or else some
one will see the light through the trees,"
for I have told you how very dark the
tangle is, even on a bright day. "Stay       dare
we shut the door? Is there a keyhole
on the inside? Oh, yes; and not rusty at
all," and quick as thought I drew the key
out and fitted it in to the other side; it
turned now with ease. "That's right;"
and before Tib or Gerald had found out for
certain whether they were awake or dreaming,
we were all three safe inside the enchanted
palace, at liberty to look about us
and find out where we really were.

I feel in a way sorry to explain it. But
this is not a fairy story; and in the end I
think you will allow, when you have come to
know the whole, that it is very interesting,
perhaps more interesting than a fairy story
after all. So I will go on without leaving
you in perplexity any more.

The place where we found ourselves was
a conservatory: it was prettily built in a
high, round-roofed sort of way, so as to
catch all the light and sun-heat possible.
It was, to begin with, a very bright afternoon;
then the shrubbery on our side was
very dark; high up in the conservatory
there was a band of coloured glass, rich red,
and little bits of every colour at the edge,
like a strip of rainbow, through which the
light came in gleams of all sorts of beautiful
tints. You can easily see how startlingly
brilliant it had seemed to us; and besides
this, the conservatory itself was not at all in
a neglected state. There were few pots of
flowers; the shelves were mostly empty;
but there were plants growing in earth
borders along the sides, which were evidently
cared for, as they twined up the walls luxuriantly.
And the whole place was heated,
though not very much. That, you see, was
how the door and the lock remained in such
good condition.

We found out all these particulars for
ourselves by degrees; and gradually we
noticed other things. The conservatory
had evidently, at some time or other, been
a favourite place to sit in. There was a
little very old and shaky rustic table, and
two or three seats to match; there was a
little corner shelf on which still lay two or
three old books. After we had got over
our first surprise, we were conscious of
something about the whole place which
made the tears come to our eyes. But our
spirits soon rose again.

"What a bower for the princess!" exclaimed
Tib.

I felt quite out of patience with her.

"Rubbish!" I said, "I can't think any
more of the princess or any make-up things.
This is far more interesting. I want to
find out all about what place it is, and why
it is shut up and deserted, as it evidently
is."

"Perhaps it's been shut up for hundreds
of years," suggested Gerald.

"That's rubbish, if you like," answered
Tib. "It doesn't look as if anybody lived
here, but it's not dirty       scarcely even dusty."

"There must be some other way of getting
into it besides our door, then," I said,
"for certainly the door hasn't been opened
for a great many years. If we look about,
perhaps we'll find some other entrance."

At first sight there was no appearance of
any, and we began to think the conservatory
must, after all, belong to Rosebuds, and that
from time to time the gardener did open the
door and get in to clean it. Only why, then,
was it always locked up? Just as we were
feeling quite puzzled, Gerald called out       

"Oh! see here, Tib and Gussie, this is
another door       here in the glass; here's a
handle that turns. Why, see, it's a door
made of looking-glass!"

That was why we had not noticed it. It
was cleverly managed to imitate panes, like
the rest of the conservatory, and it was
somewhat in the shade in one corner. There
was no lock to this door; it opened at once,
and before us we saw a long, rather narrow,
covered passage, lighted by a skylight roof. It
was all growing more and more mysterious;
half frightened, but too eager and curious
to think of being afraid, on we ran. The
passage ended in a short flight of steps, at
the top of which was another door, a regular
proper door this time, with a handle and a
lock, but no key in the lock.

"Oh! supposing it's locked," I cried,
excitedly; "it will be too bad. We can't
find out any more."

But it wasn't. The key, as we afterwards
found, was inside, and not turned in the
lock. They were evidently not very afraid
of robbers. All the years the house had
stood empty, no one had ever broken into
it; we were the first intruders.

We pressed forward. First we found
ourselves in a sort of little ante-room, very
small, hardly bigger than a closet, and out
of this, through another door, opened a
very large and handsome drawing-room.
It had a row of windows at one side looking
out upon a terrace, and a large bow window
at one end, with closely-drawn blinds       we
could not see what it looked on to; the floor
was of beautifully polished wood, inlaid in
a pattern such as you see more often in
French houses than in English ones; the
two mantelpieces were very high, and beautifully
carved, and from the centre of the
ceiling hung an immense gilt and crystal
chandelier, covered up in muslin. There
was not much furniture in the room, and
what there was looked stiff and cold: two
or three great cabinets against the walls,
and some gilt consol-tables, and in one
corner a group of sofas, and chairs, and
arm-chairs all drawn together, and all in
white linen covers. Everything was handsome,
and stately, and melancholy; the
very feeling of the room told you it
had not been really lived in for many
a day.

But the one thing which caught our
attention was a life-size portrait hanging
at the end of the room opposite the bow
window. It was the only picture of any
kind, and even though we were ignorant
children, we could see in a moment that it
was a very beautiful one. It represented a
young girl, richly dressed in the fashion of
a hundred years ago or more, with long-waisted
bodice, and skirt of white satin,
looped up over an under-one of rose-coloured
brocade. She was standing on a
terrace       this very terrace we afterwards
found       her hat hanging on her arm, and a
greyhound beside her. It was all pretty
much the same as one often sees in portraits
of that time, but her face was so charming!
And immediately we saw it, both Gerald
and I exclaimed

"Oh, Tib, she is exactly like you!" and
going close to examine it more particularly,
I saw some letters in one corner, and, to
my immense surprise, they were those of
the name scored out in the old book,
"Ornaments Discovered," and of Tib's
second name also       "Regina." The initials
of the artist       "L.K.," I think       were there
also.

"It is my name," said Tib, opening her
eyes in astonishment; "how very strange!
Can it be the picture of some great-great-grandmother
of ours, I wonder?
But this is not grandpapa's house.
How could any portrait of our family
be here?"

We were completely puzzled, but, children-like,
we did not think very much more about
it. It was such fun to slide up and down
the polished floor, or to climb over among
the shrouded chairs and sofas, and make
ourselves a comfortable nest among them.
For it was plain that our discoveries were
not to go further       the large double doors
of this drawing-room were securely locked
from the outside.

We went close up to this door, putting
our ears to the keyhole even, and listened,
but not the least sound was to be heard.

"The house must be shut up," I said.
"There is certainly no one moving about
in it."

"Perhaps it is enchanted," said Gerald,
in an awe-struck tone. "Perhaps that lady
is really alive, and the fairies have fastened
her up into that picture till       till       " and he
hesitated; his imagination had come to an
end of its flight.

Tib and I looked at each other without
speaking. We did not snub Gerald as we
often did for such speeches       somehow it
didn't seem so very impossible! Everything
was so strange; the room itself so
unlike anything we had ever seen, the
mysterious way into it, the silence and
desertedness, yet the signs of care; above
all, the portrait so wonderfully like Tib, and
actually bearing her name. There was no
explaining it by anything we could think
of or imagine.

"We may as well use it all to make a
play of," said Tib, at last, returning to her
favourite idea. "We can pretend that the
lady in the portrait is the princess something,
as Gerald says. Yes, it would be
still nicer to make her be enchanted instead
of only shut up, and then, Gussie, you
must help me to plan how she's to be got
out."

"But, Tib," I said, "do you think we can
come here again? Don't you think grandpapa
would mind, after all he said to us
about not making friends, or going into any
houses in the village?"

"And are we making friends?" said Tib.
"Unless the portrait comes out of its
frame some day, and begins talking to
us, there's certainly nobody else to talk
to here."

"Do you think there's nobody living in
the house?" I said, doubtfully.

"I'm sure there's not. Most likely some
one comes to dust it every now and then."

"And don't you remember," said Gerald,
"that last Sunday I asked grandpapa if we
might come through the door in the wall if
we could, and he said 'yes'? P'r'aps he
knew about this place, and didn't mind if
we did come here to play."

"Perhaps," I said; "anyway we can ask
him the next time he comes."

"We needn't say anything about it to
Mrs. Munt, or nurse," said Tib, decidedly.
"As long as we haven't been told not to
come, we're not disobeying, and it's much
nicer not to ask any one but grandpapa
himself."

With that I quite agreed, especially as I
felt sure grandpapa himself would like
it better. We knew we were doing no
mischief; there was nobody to speak to, as
Tib had said, so we felt quite at ease, and
spent a most agreeable afternoon. When
we had examined everything there was in
the big drawing-room, or saloon, as Tib
preferred to call it       and that did not take
us very long; there were no curiosities or
small ornaments about, as in the Rosebuds
drawing-room       we began to plan again
about our play story. We arranged it most
beautifully, and the portrait was a great
help, for it almost gave us another actor, as
we could always pretend it was the princess,
when Tib was wanted for another person.
And it was such a wonderfully life-like
picture       you could really have fancied its
expression changed as we talked to it.

But at last we began to get frightened
that we should be missed at home if we
stayed any longer.

"We must go, Gussie," said Tib, "let us
all say good-night to the princess. It is
sad to leave you alone here, princess," she
went on, turning to the portrait, and
speaking in the tone of one of the ladies in
the play, who were going to help her to
escape, "but, alas, there is no other way to
do. If we stayed longer we should only be
suspected of plotting, so we must resign
ourselves."

"And I dare say you're pretty well
accustomed to being left alone by this time.
You must be nearly a hundred years old,
though you look so young," said Gerald, as
he bowed to her. I could not help laughing,
though Tib was rather vexed.

"I wish you wouldn't think it clever to
turn everything into ridicule, Gerald," but he
looked up with such a surprised face that
we saw he hadn't been in fun at all.

"There's one thing we'd better do if we
want ever to get in here again," I said.
"We must hide the key of the door leading
from the passage. I dare say the person
who comes to dust will never notice it's
not there. They can't be in the habit of
locking it regularly; but it's as well to
hide it," and so saying, I took the key out
of the lock and slipped it inside a drawer
of one of the big cabinets, where it may be
lying still, for all I know (I must look, by
the by: writing this all out has reminded
me of several things I had forgotten).

Then we closed the door carefully and
ran down the passage to the conservatory
again, where we found everything just as
we had left it       our key, as we called it,
sticking in the lock inside. It was still
rather stiff to turn       and the next morning
we oiled it again       but we managed to unlock
it, and then to lock the door again on
the outside.

And Gerald ran off with the key to hide
it again in the summer-house; only we
wrapped it up in paper before burying it in
the fir dust.

"Who would have thought," said Tib,
as we ran in, "who could have thought,
what we should find this afternoon?"

But our surprises, as you shall hear, were
not yet at an end.
      

      
CHAPTER VII.
GRANDPAPA'S SECRETARY.


        . "Children are the best judges of character at first
sight in the world."       Hogg.
      





randpapa
did not come
down to Rosebuds
again for
three or four
weeks. Mrs. Munt
wrote to him regularly
to tell him how we
were, and we, once
or twice       it was she who put it in
our heads, I must confess       wrote a
little scrap to put inside hers, for which
he told her to thank us when he wrote
back to her, but he never sent us any
letter.

We didn't mind his not coming, except
that now and then we thought we should
like to tell him of our discovery, and hear
what he said about it. But we were very
happy; we never cared to go out for walks,
which I don't think nurse regretted; we
always said we were much happier playing
about. And the conservatory and the saloon
became our regular haunts every, or almost
every, afternoon. No one ever disturbed
us       we never heard the slightest sound in
the house where the big drawing-room was;
indeed, for all we knew, it might not have
been a house at all, but just that one large
room, for the other door       the proper door
of the room       was never opened. We tried
it two or three times; it was always firmly
locked. But still it was clear that somebody
came to dust the room and the conservatory,
if not every day, at least two or three times
a week, for they were not allowed to get any
dustier.

It was a good thing we were quiet
children, not given to mischief, or rough
and wild, otherwise we might have done
harm in some way, such as breaking the
glass in the conservatory, or spoiling the
beautiful "parquet" floor. And we certainly
would have been discovered. It was
partly the fear of this that made us so
careful, as well as a queer fancy we had that
the picture on the wall       the princess, as we
still called her       watched all we did, and
that she would be very vexed if we were
not quite good.

"Of course," Tib used to say, "it's a great
honour to be allowed to play in a palace,
and we must show we are to be trusted."

For after a while we got tired of our play-story
about the baron and the humpback
and all the rest of it, and then we pretended
that we came to visit the princess in her
beautiful palace, and that she was very kind
to us indeed.

Sometimes we brought our books and
work with us; on a rainy day we always
found it difficult to get to our secret haunts,
for of course we wouldn't tell stories about
it, and nurse naturally didn't approve of our
going out in the damp. But after a while,
when nurse found that we came in quite
dry, and that we never caught cold even
when she left us to our own devices on a
wet day, she gave up being so fidgety, and
so we often did get to our palace all the
same.

One Friday at last there came a letter,
saying grandpapa would be down the next
day and a gentleman with him.

"What a bore that he's not coming alone,"
said I. "We shan't have a word with him,
and the gentleman's sure to be one of those
stupid Parliamentary people that talk to
grandpapa about 'the House,' and 'so-and-so's
bill,' all the time." For we had had
some experience of grandpapa's friends
sometimes at Ansdell, when we had come in
to dessert and heard them talking. "I
wonder if they go on all day long in the
'House' about bills, Tib? There must be a
fearful lot of people who never pay theirs if
it takes all those clever gentlemen all their
time to be settling about them in the
'House.'" We were rather proud of knowing
what the "House" meant, you see.
We thought from grandpapa's being in it,
that we knew all about the government
things.

Tib looked rather solemn.

"I suppose it's because of the National
Debt," she said. "It shows how careful
people should be not to spend too much,
doesn't it, Gussie? But I'm not sure that
I care to speak to grandpapa more than
usual. I'm so awfully afraid of his stopping
us going to the palace."

"Are you?" said I. "I'm not. That is
to say, if I thought he'd mind it, I wouldn't
go there. What I want is to find out
about it from him. I have still such an idea
that it has something to do with the old
mystery."

"If I thought that," said Tib, "I'd be
far too frightened to tell him about it."

We spent a long time that afternoon in
the big drawing-room. When we were
coming away, we all somehow felt a little
melancholy.

"We are pretty sure not to be able to
come to-morrow, and certainly not on
Sunday," said Tib, sadly. "Dear princess,"
she went on, looking at the portrait, "you
mustn't forget us if we don't come to see
you for a few days. It won't be our fault,
you may be sure;" and really we could
have fancied that the sweet face smiled at
us as we turned to go.

We were playing on the lawn when grandpapa
arrived the next day. Nurse had
intended to have us all solemnly prepared,
like the last time, but he came by an earlier
train, and somehow she didn't know about
it early enough, so we were all in our garden
things quite comfortably messy, when we
heard the sound of wheels, and looking
round, saw to our astonishment that it was
the dog-cart.

There was no help for it; we hadn't even
time to wash our hands, and there was no
use trying to get out of the way, for to have
gone hurry-skurrying off as if we were
ashamed would have vexed grandpapa more
than anything, especially as he had a friend
with him. So we marched boldly across
the lawn and stood waiting, while the
gentlemen got down.

"How do you do, grandpapa?" I said.
"We didn't expect you quite so soon."

"Indeed," said he, as he kissed us in his
usual cool sort of way, "an unwelcome surprise       eh?"

Tib got red at this, and looked as if she
were going to cry. But I didn't feel inclined
to be put down like that, before a
stranger, too.

"No, grandpapa; it's not an unwelcome
surprise, but we would have liked to have
been tidier; you know we generally are
quite tidy when you see us."

"For my part, I prefer to see small
people when they're not very tidy," said a
pleasant, hearty voice; and then the owner
of it came round from the other side of the
dog-cart where he had jumped down. "You
must introduce me, Mr. Ansdell, please, to
my       small, I was going to say, but I'm
surprised to see the word would be almost
a libel       cousins."

"Umph," said grandpapa, "'cousins,' in
the Scotch sense; how many degrees removed,
it would be difficult to say."

"I've not been taught to count you so
very far away," said the gentleman, good-humouredly,
but with something in his tone
that showed he wasn't the sort of person
to be very easily put down; "besides,
sir, as I'm your godson as well as your
cousin              "

"I might be a little more civil, eh,
Charles?" said grandpapa, laughing a little.
"Ah, well, I'm too old to learn, I fear.
Nevertheless, I have no objection to your
calling each other cousins if you choose.
Mercedes, Gustava, and Gerald       your
cousin, Mr. Charles Truro."

We looked at him, and he looked at us.
What we saw was a well-made, pleasant-looking
young man, not very tall, though
not short, with merry-looking grey eyes,
close cut brown hair, and a particularly
kindly expression, a great improvement
upon most of grandpapa's gentlemen friends,
who never looked at us as if they saw us.

"Mercedes and Gustava," he repeated,
slowly. "I thought one of them was called
Re              "

But grandpapa interrupted him.

"Mercedes is an absurd name for an
English child," he said. "It was a fancy
of poor Gerald's       they were in Spain, you
know."

"But you needn't call Tib 'Mercedes,'
unless you like," I said, boldly       I don't
really know what spirit of defiance, perhaps
of curiosity, made me say it       "she has
another name; her second name is Regina,
like              "

Would you believe it? I was on the point
of saying "like the picture;" but I cut
myself short before I said more, and even
had I not stopped, grandpapa's tone would
have startled me into doing so.

"Will you be so good, Gustava, as to
answer questions and remarks that are addressed
to you, and those only?" he said,
in his horrible, icy way.

I felt myself getting red now, especially
as I was certain Mr. Truro was looking at
me. I made a silent vow that I wouldn't
try to be nicer to grandpapa, and that I
would certainly not tell him about our
secret. This comforted me a little, and I
glanced up, to find that the stranger was
looking at me, but in such a nice way that I
couldn't have felt vexed if I had tried.

"Will you take me round the garden?"
he said. "I am quite stiff with sitting so
long."

He spoke to us all, but I think he meant
it most for me. Grandpapa didn't seem to
mind. I think that when he had said anything
very crabbed, he was sorry, though
he wouldn't say so.

"Don't be very long, Charles," he said,
as he went into the house and we turned
the other way, "I shall want you to look
over those papers."

"All right, sir, I won't be long," Mr.
Truro called back in his cheery tone.

"Why does he want you to do his
papers?" I asked.

Mr. Truro laughed.

"Because I'm acting as Mr. Ansdell's
secretary just now," he said.

Tib looked disappointed.

"Oh," she said, "I thought you were a              "
and she stopped.

"Say on," said Mr. Truro.

"A       a gentleman," said Tib.

"Well, I hope I am," he said, smiling.

"But doesn't he," I said, nodding my
head towards the house, for I perfectly understood
what Tib meant, "pay you for
being that?"

"In point of fact Mr. Ansdell does not
pay me," he said. "What I learn from
being with him is far more valuable than
money to me. But all the same, if your
grandfather did pay me for my services, that
would not make me less of a gentleman!"
and Mr. Truro stood erect, and gave a little
toss to his head, which showed he could be
in earnest when he liked. But then he
laughed again, and we saw he was not
really vexed. "May I make a remark in
turn?" he said. "Are you young people
in the habit of talking of Mr. Ansdell
as 'he' and 'him?' 'She,' I know,
is 'the cat.' I have yet to learn who
'he' is."

We laughed, but we blushed too, a
little.

"We don't always," said Tib; "but you
see you are a cousin; mayn't we tell him
things?" she exclaimed, impulsively, turning
to Gerald and me. "He's got such a kind
face, and       and we haven't anybody like
other children."

Mr. Truro turned his face away for half a
second. I fancy he didn't want us to see
how sorry he looked. By this time we had
sauntered round to the other side of the
lawn, out of sight of the house almost.
There was a garden seat near where we
stood. Mr. Truro took Tib and me by the
hand, and Gerald trotted after.

"Let's sit down," he said. "Now, that's
comfortable. Yes, dears, I am a cousin,
and I think you'll find me a faithful one.
Do tell me 'things.' I won't let you say
anything not right of your grandfather;
there is no man living I respect more. But
perhaps I may help you to understand him
better."

"Is he never cross to you?" asked Tib;
"at least, not so much cross as that horrid
laughy-at-you-way       laughy without being
funny or nice, you know."

"Yes, I do know," he answered. "I
think Mr. Ansdell is inclined to be that way
to everybody a little. I wish you could
hear how he makes some of them smart now
and then in the House."

"The people who don't pay their bills       the
people who make the National Debt, do
you mean?" I asked.

"The how much?" asked our new cousin
in his turn, opening his eyes very wide.

And when I explained what I meant,
about all the talk we had heard about bills,
and how Tib had read something about the
National Debt, and thought it must mean
that, you should have seen how he laughed;
not a bit like grandpapa, but just roaring.
I know better now, of course. I know that
there are different kinds of bills, and that
the ones we had heard of being talked about
in Parliament are new plans or proposals
that the gentlemen there       "members," like
grandpapa       want to have made into laws,
because they think they would be good
laws. I know, too, pretty well       at least a
little       about the National Debt, and that
somehow it isn't a bad thing, though little
debts are very bad things. I don't see how,
but I suppose I shall understand when I'm
big, that things that are bad when they're
little aren't always bad when they're
very big.

When Mr. Truro had finished laughing,
he began to listen to all we had to tell him.
You would hardly believe how much we
told him. Indeed, when we thought it
over afterwards we could hardly believe it
ourselves; to think that here was a strange
gentleman we hadn't known an hour, whose
name we had never heard in our lives, and
that we were talking to him as we had
never before talked to anybody. He had
such a way of looking as if he really cared
to hear. I think it was that that made it
so easy to talk to him; and then, of course,
his being a cousin made a difference. He
wasn't a very near one, but I have noticed
that sometimes rather far-off cousins care
for you quite as much or more than much
nearer ones. And anything in the shape of
a cousin was a great deal to us; we had
never heard of having any at all.

After we had chattered away for some
time, some little remark, I forget what
exactly, something about what we did with
ourselves all day after lessons were over,
seeing that we had no friends or companions,
for we had told him about grandpapa's not
allowing us to know any neighbours; something
of that kind brought us dreadfully
near the subject of our discovery. We had
already said something, though very little,
about the old book with the scored-out
name, and Mr. Truro listened eagerly,
though it struck me afterwards more than
at the time that he had not seemed very
surprised.

And when we did not at once answer
about how we amused ourselves, he repeated
the question. We looked at each
other. Then Tib got rather red, and said,
quietly,

"We can't tell you all we do, at least, I
don't think we can," she said, glancing at
Gerald and me.

Mr. Truro looked a little startled.

"Why not?" he said. "I am sure, at
least I think I may be, that you wouldn't
do anything you shouldn't. If, for example,
you had been tempted to make friends with
any of the village children, it would be
much better to tell your grandfather; he
might not mind if they were good children,
even if they were not of the same class as
you. But it would be wrong not to tell him."

We began to feel a little frightened, and
for the first time a misgiving came over us
that perhaps grandpapa might be angry at
our having played in the palace. I suppose
our faces grew so solemn that Mr. Truro felt
more uneasy.

"Come now," he said, "can't you tell me
all about it? I don't look very ogre-y, do
I? That is, if you've no real objection to
telling me before you tell Mr. Ansdell."

"We meant to tell him; we were going
to tell him to-day," I said. "Indeed, we,
at least I, wanted to tell him. I thought
perhaps he'd explain, or that we'd find out
about it. But he isn't as kind this time as
he was the last, and perhaps he'd be angry,
really angry. I never thought before that
it was a thing he could be angry about,
did you, Tib?"

"No," said Tib, faintly; "and it would
be so dreadful not to go there any more."

Gerald began to cry.

Mr. Truro's face grew graver and graver.

"My dear children," he began, "my dear
little cousins, I must speak very earnestly
to you. You must tell this secret, whatever
it is, to your grandfather. It might not
make him angry just now, but if you did
not tell him, I very much fear it might."

"But he is so very sharp to-day,"
said Tib; "you could see he was. And
when he is like that we can't tell things
properly, and it somehow seems as if we
were naughty when we aren't really. We
can't tell him to-day, can we?"

Mr. Truro reflected.

"It is true," he said, "that Mr. Ansdell
is particularly busy and worried. He has
been terribly overworked lately; indeed, he
came down here expressly to be able to
work without interruption. Can't you
confide in me, children? I promise to
advise you to the very best of my
ability."

"And you wouldn't tell him       grandpapa,
I mean," said Tib, correcting herself, "without
telling us you were going to?"

"Certainly not. I should have no right
to tell him without your leave," he replied.

We all looked at each other again.

"I suppose we'd better, then," I said.
"You begin, Tib. It's rather difficult to
think where it began," I went on. "It had
to do with grandpapa telling us so about
not knowing the neighbours, or making
friends with any one, and we had never
heard of Rosebuds before, you know, and
then I remembered seeing it in the book,
and Tib likes mysteries so, and              "

"Take breath, Gussie, there's no such
dreadful hurry," said Mr. Truro, and his
face grew more smiling as I went on.

"We fixed to make a story about it.
It didn't seem like prying to play at it
that way," said Tib.

And then we went on to tell all about
the imprisoned princess, and the old arbour,
and the supposed tool-house, which was to
be a dungeon, and Gerald finding the key,
and just everything       all that I have written;
I needn't tell it all again. And with every
word Mr. Truro's kind face grew kinder and
brighter; all the grave, uneasy look went
quite out of it, and this, of course, made it
much easier to tell it all quite comfortably.
By the time we had quite finished       it took
a good while, for Gerald would interrupt to
tell that he had found the key, and he had
made it turn when Tib and Gussie couldn't       Mr.
Truro's face had grown more than
bright, it looked quite beaming.

"And the portrait of the princess is like
Tib, you say       Mercedes, I should say? I
would like best of all to call you 'Regina';"
and he passed his hand softly over Tib's
dark hair.

"Awfully like Tib, only prettier," I said,
bluntly. But Tib didn't mind. Something
in Mr. Truro's tone had caught her
attention.

"Did you ever know any one called
Regina?" she asked. "You seem to like
it so."

Mr. Truro did not answer for a moment.
Then he said, quietly, "It is a family name
with me, too. I have heard it all my life.
You know I am your cousin."

"Oh, of course," we all said.

Then he went on to talk of what we had
been telling him.

"Will you let me think over about it?"
he said. "I am the last person to advise
you not to tell your grandfather everything,
but I do not think it would be wise to tell
him anything just now, as he is extremely
busy and worried. I will tell you what I
think you should do before I go."

Of course we agreed readily to what he
said.
      

      
CHAPTER VIII.
STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME.


"And, even as one on household stairs,
      Who meets an angel unawares,
      Might hold his breath; in silent awe
      We stood."
      The Unknown Portrait       Sir Noel Paton.
      





e saw very little
of grandpapa
during this visit,
and not as much
of Mr. Truro as
we would have
liked. For it was
some very bothering
time about government things, and
everybody that had to do with them
was very busy. We came in to dessert, as
we always did, and grandpapa was kind in
his own way. He seemed pleased that we
were such good friends with Mr. Truro. I
remember he said something to him about
his having done already what he       grandpapa       had
not been able to do himself       "gained
our hearts," or something like that.
And Mr. Truro answered. "You could if
you would, sir, or probably you have if you
would but think so." But grandpapa only
shook his head, though he smiled a little in
a nice way.

And then they began talking again about
all the papers and writings they had to do,
and we got tired of sitting still, and fidgeted
with the wine glasses and things on the
table, so that grandpapa told us we had
better go to bed.

The next day, Sunday, was pouring wet.

We didn't see either grandpapa or our
cousin till we were sitting in church. We
had come with nurse in the one-horse fly,
which knew it always had to come for us
on wet Sundays, and we didn't hear
anything of the two gentlemen. We
couldn't bear the long drive in the stuffy
fly, and we did not like the church, for
the clergyman was old, and mumbled his
words, and the music wasn't nice nor
anything else.

"If we might only go to the pretty
church in the village!" we whispered to
each other, as we whispered every Sunday.
For this about the church was the thing
we disliked at Rosebuds, and at Ansdell
we loved going to church. It was so nice;
beautiful hummy music and lovely singing,
and all so pretty. And the clergyman with
a nice clear voice, and not too long
sermons. And       perhaps you will be shocked
at this       everybody at Ansdell knew us,
and there was always a little sort of rustle
when we went in, and I could almost hear
the school-girls talking in whispers about
"our young ladies' hats;" and if we
happened to see one of them we knew,
and gave her a little nod and smile, she
looked as proud as proud! It was just as
different as could be from this ugly, stupid
little church that grandpapa had taken it
into his head to make us go to here, and
we were very pleased when we saw Mr.
Truro coming up the aisle after grandpapa,
both of them looking so nice and grand,
even though in a way we felt ashamed for
our cousin to see what an ugly little church
it was.

"He'll see for himself," I whispered to
Tib, "and perhaps he'll say something to
grandpapa."

For we were beginning to think of Mr.
Truro as a sort of good fairy who was to
put everything right.

Grandpapa and he had driven over in
the dog-cart of course; they didn't mind
the rain, though I'm sure we didn't mind
it either, for that matter       we should only
have been too happy to drive over in the
dog-cart under waterproofs and mackintoshes;
and when we were getting into the
fly after church, Gerald looked so woebegone,
that Mr. Truro took pity on him,
and picked him out again.

"I'll find a corner for you where you
shan't get wet," he said, in his nice, bright
way.

Lucky Gerald! we heard him chattering
as he went off in Mr. Truro's arms. "You
know it is worstest for me, isn't it? for I'm
only seven, and it does make my head
ache so."

I suppose he had       what is it you call
it?       squeams of conscience, is that the word?
I must ask Re       oh, how stupid I am! that
it was selfish of him to desert us. He
always takes refuge in his being the
youngest and "only seven," as it was then,
when he is afraid he is going to be blamed.

But, after all, it was a good deal better
in the fly without him. Nurse doesn't
think it rude of us to whisper when we are
alone with her, so Tib and I could say anything
we liked to each other all the way
home, without Gerald's rosy round face
poking in between us every moment to
say, "What did you say, Tib?" "I can't
hear, Gussie!"

What we did keep saying to each other
was mostly about Mr. Truro. What was he
going to fix we should do? Would he
"think it over" till he found out we should
tell grandpapa at once; and if grandpapa
were worried, and said in a hurry we must
never go to our palace any more, how
horrible it would be!

"I don't think he will," said Tib. "He's
so very understanding. If he could only
see the place himself, he would quite understand
that we can't get any harm there, or
do any mischief."

"Yes," I said, "I wish we could have
shown it him. Besides, if he's our cousin,
and has heard about 'Reginas,' he might
find out something about our princess."

But Tib didn't care about this idea.

"I don't want it spoilt," she said; "I've
got used to her being just our princess, and
to there being a mystery. I don't want to
undo it."

It didn't look very like undoing it. We
never saw Mr. Truro all that afternoon, and
it was one of the longest I ever remember.
It cleared up about tea-time, and we went
three times round the lawn, on the gravel
path, of course, and we saw grandpapa at
the drawing-room window, which he had
thrown open for some air, as we came in,
and he asked us if we had seen Mr. Truro.
And when we said no, he turned away,
saying, rather crossly, "I wish he'd be
quick; I'm sure it's not a very tempting day
for a long walk," and Tib and I rather
agreed with Gerald that we shouldn't much
care to be grandpapa's "Scretchetary."

But late that evening       near bed-time it
was       we heard a quick step coming to the
schoolroom door.

"May I come in?" said Mr. Truro's
voice.

We all jumped up to welcome him, and
nurse discreetly retired.

"I can't stay long, dears," he said, "and
we are off first thing to-morrow morning.
But listen; I don't think you need speak to
your grandfather about your discovery just
now. Wait till he comes back the next
time, a fortnight hence. I shall come with
him, and he will not then be nearly so busy.
I have satisfied myself that you cannot
come to any harm in your palace, and I am
sure you will do no mischief there."

"No; and perhaps grandpapa knew of
it       what do you think?       the day he said
we might go through the door in the wall
if we could. And he only forbade us
making friends with people."

"Not with portraits," said Mr. Truro,
with a smile. "Well, good-bye, my dear
little cousins. I can't tell you how pleased
I am to have made friends with you."

He stooped and kissed us all, hurriedly,
for we heard doors opening, and a voice in
the distance, which we were quite sure was
grandpapa's, "Where is Mr. Truro?" and
then he was gone, and we didn't see him
again the next morning.

It almost seemed like a dream his having
been at Rosebuds at all, especially when we
again found ourselves in the saloon that
afternoon, our dear princess smiling down
at us as usual.

"You don't know, princess, what a nice
new cousin we have got," we said to her, for
we had got into the way of telling her
everything that interested us; "I'm sure
you'd like him, and I'm sure he'd like you,"
Tib went on, and we really could have
fancied the sweet, proud face gave a little
amused smile. "I think he was very sorry
not to come to see you, but perhaps he will
the next time he's here."

Then we went on with some of our usual
plays, and we were as happy as could be.
It seemed somehow a good long while since
we had been in the palace, though in reality
it was only three days, and we were
tempted to stay a little later than usual.
But just as we were thinking we must go,
a rather queer thing happened. You remember
my telling you that the other door
of the saloon, the real big door, which must
have been the regular way of coming into
the room from the rest of the house       if
there was a house       I don't think we had
really ever thought seriously if there was a
house, or if the saloon was a sort of pavilion
in a garden all by itself       well, this door
was locked, firmly locked; we had tried it
two or three times, but it was quite fast.
Not stuck or stiff, or anything like that,
but quite locked. But this day, just as we
were coming away, we heard a little, very
little, faint squeak, like some one trying to
open or shut a door very, very softly, and
looking at the big heavy gilt handles       it
was a double door, with two sets of
handles and all that, you understand       we
distinctly saw one of them turn,
and then all was quiet and motionless
again.

We looked at each other, and then we all
darted forward       I think it was rather brave
of us       and seized the handle. It turned
certainly, easily enough, as door handles
generally do, but that was all. The door
didn't open; it was as firmly fastened as
before.

"If we hadn't all seen it," said Tib, "I
should have thought it was fancy."

But we were satisfied that it wasn't.

"Whoever turned the handle must have
locked the door again on the other side as
quick as thought," I said. "They must
have been peeping in at us without our
hearing, and then when they heard the
squeak the handle made as they were
closing the door again, they must have
quietly locked it, expecting us to come to see
who was there. I wonder who it was!"

We all wondered, but in vain.

"It may have only been the person who
comes in to dust," said Tib; "there
must be such a person, unless the princess
herself comes out of her frame in the
night to do it. Only if it were that
person, most likely she'd have come
in and asked us who we were, and
what business we had there; it's very
queer."

We decided when we went home that the
next day we should make our way in as
quietly as we possibly could, so that if any
one were there, they shouldn't hear us in
time to run away.

"And we'll sit quite still all the afternoon,"
said Gerald; "we won't make the
least bit of noise, so that they'll think we're
not there, and then they'll come straight
in."

"They must have known we were there
to-day; it's not likely they'll come straight
in if they don't want us to see them," said
Tib. "I can't make it out; whoever they
are, they've more right there than we have.
I think the only way is to take our
books to-day and sit quietly reading; and
we had better hide ourselves as much as we
can, so that we shouldn't be seen all at
once."

"Aren't you at all frightened?" said
Gerald. "S'pose it was some kind of robbers?"

"Nonsense," said I. "Mr. Truro said
he was satisfied we couldn't come to any
harm there: I believe what he said.
I'm not going to be frightened       are you
Tib?"

"N       no. I don't think so," she
replied, rather doubtfully. "Any way,
I shouldn't at all like never to go there
again."

But we all three did feel very excited the
next afternoon, and I think all our hearts
were beating a good deal faster than usual
as we noiselessly made our way out of
the conservatory and along the passage
now so familiar to us, through the little
anteroom, and then, as quietly as possible,
opened the door into the saloon.
And then       

You know, I dare say       big people must
know all about these things better than
children       how very quickly thoughts, or
feelings, or something not exactly either       since
I wrote that, a big person has told
me that the word that best says what I
mean is impressions: I am not sure that
it says it to me; but that is, perhaps,
because I have never thought of the word
in that way before       You must know
how very quickly one seems to know a
thing sometimes, before there could have
been time, even, to get to know it by any
regular way of hearing or seeing. Well,
that was how it was with us that day.
The very instant the door opened we knew
there was something different in the room       it
seemed warmer, more alive, there was
more feeling in it; and yet it was darker
than we had ever seen it before       at least,
that end of the room where our princess
was had got into the shade somehow. Her
face was not the first thing that caught
our eyes, as it usually was; or was it her
face?

I dare say you will think us too silly
when I tell you that for about half a
second we did think the princess had
really stepped down out of the frame. It
was so like her. There she stood, quite
still, but smiling at us as if she had expected
us. Her hair was dark       like Tib's
and like the picture's       her eyes just the
same as both of theirs; but she was far,
far prettier than
either! She was
dressed in something
white, and
there was some
pink about it,
too; and
though of
course it
wasn't
really
made the
same way
as the
dress in
the picture,
it
was like
enough to give a confused feeling at the first
of being the same. And she was standing
a little in the same way, and a hat       a
black hat with drooping feathers       was slung
on her arm.

We three just stood and gaped, and
stared as if our eyes would come out of our
heads. And she stood, still smiling, but
perfectly motionless.

Gerald was the first to come to his senses.
He ran forward a little towards the end of
the room where the portrait was       it was
still there; it was only that one of the
blinds had been drawn down so as to cast it
into shade       and glancing up at the wall, he
called out,

"It's still there       it isn't it. It's another
princess."

And at his words a peal of laughter       not
very loud, but such pretty clear
laughter, I wish you could hear it!       rang
through the room, and the new
princess, the living, moving princess,
came forward to us, holding out her
hands.

"So you have come at last," she said;
"I expected you this morning. I knew
you heard me at the door yesterday, and I
thought your curiosity would bring you
early."

I didn't quite like her calling us "curious."
It wasn't quite the right word to use for all
our pretty fancies about the princess, and
even about the mystery.

"We never can come in the morning,"
I said, "because of our lessons. And       it
wasn't curiosity."

"Indeed!" she replied, a tiny little bit
mockingly; "not curiosity. What shall I
call it, then, your inquiring minds, eh?"

I felt my face get red, and I felt that
Tib's was getting red too.

"I don't know who you are," I burst out,
"and if you don't choose to tell us, I am
not going to ask. That isn't curiosity. But
I wish you hadn't come; you've spoilt it
all. Our own princess," and I glanced up
at the portrait, looking, I could not but
confess, like a washed-out doll beside the
brilliant living beauty of the girl beside us,
"our own princess is much nicer than you.
And if we had been so curious we might
have tried to find out things in pokey
ways. We've never done that."

I looked, I suppose ready to cry. The
lady's face changed, and then I knew that
while she had been talking in that half
teasing way, something in her voice and
smile had reminded me of grandpapa       of
grandpapa, I mean, when he was in that
sort of laughing-at-us way that we couldn't
bear. Perhaps this had made us all feel
more vexed at her than she really deserved
us to be. But when her face changed, and
a soft, sorry look came over it, she reminded
me of more than any real face I had ever
seen       she reminded me of all the prettiest
and nicest fancies I had ever had; the
sweet look in her eyes was so sweet, that
I wished I might put my arms round her
and kiss her. And Tib told me afterwards
that she had felt exactly the same.

"I'm very sorry," she said, simply; "I
didn't come here to hurt your feelings.
Good fairies never do that, unless to very
naughty children, whose feelings need to
be hurt. And yours don't need to be hurt,
for I know you're not naughty children       very
far from it. Of course you wouldn't
try to find out things in any way that
wasn't nice, I know that. But wouldn't you
like to know my name?"

"If you like to tell it," we said, smiling
up at her.

"Or would you rather count me a sort of
a fairy?" she went on.

"Are you one?" said Gerald, softly
stroking the pretty soft stuff of which her
dress was made.

"Perhaps," she said, smiling again. "I
shouldn't wonder if you could decide that
better than I can. Try to find out       think
of some things I couldn't know unless I were
a fairy."

"I know," said Gerald; "our names.
You couldn't know them if you weren't a
fairy, or       or if perhaps you knowed some
fairies who had told you them," he added,
getting a little muddled.

"If I had a fairy godmother, for instance,
who had told me them," she said.

"Yes       that might be it," said Gerald.

"Well, then       dear me, I mustn't make
any mistake, or my godmother would be
very angry, after all her teaching," she said,
pretending to look very trying-to-remember,
like Gerald when he stops at "eight times
nine," and screws up his mouth and knits
his brows. "Well, to begin with, the
eldest. This is Tib       but her real name is
Mercedes Regina; this is Gustava; and this
is Gerald Charles. And Gustava is generally
called 'Gussie.' Now, have I said my
lesson rightly?"

We all stared at her.

"You must be a fairy," said Gerald. But
Tib and I felt too puzzled to say anything.

"What shall we call you?" I asked.

"Anything you like. I've got a lot of
names. One of them, curious to say, is the
same as the name scribbled on the portrait
just above the name of the painter. Did
you ever notice it?"

"Do you mean the same name as Tib's
second one?" I asked; "Regina?"

The young lady nodded her head.

"That's very funny," we said. "That's
the name in the book in London too."

"What book?" she asked, quickly.

I hesitated a moment. Then I thought
as I had said so much it would be stupid
not to explain. So I told her. She looked
sad and thoughtful as she listened.

"It was scored out, you said?" she
asked.

"Yes, with a thick black stroke, as
if somebody had been very angry when
they did it," I said. "If we hadn't
known the name, from its being Tib's,
I don't think we could ever have made
it out."

"Ah," said the young lady, and it sounded
like a sigh. But in a moment she smiled
again.

"I didn't come here to make you sad,"
she said. "Won't you tell me about
the games you play, and let me play
with you. Perhaps my fairy godmother
has taught me some that you
don't know and that you would like to
learn."

But we didn't feel quite ready for playing
games yet. There were two or three things
on our minds. The new princess saw that
we looked uncertain.

"What is it?" she said. "You look as
if you were afraid of me."

"No," said Tib, and "No," said I. "It
isn't that, but there are some things we
want to ask you."

"Ask them. I won't call you curious, I
prom              "

But just that moment a bell rang       not
loudly, but she heard it at once, and
started up. She had been sitting on one of
the old couches, with us all about her. "I
must go," she said. "Come to-morrow and
I will tell you all I can. Good-bye; good-bye
till to-morrow," and in half an instant       I
never saw any one move so quick       she
had gone. We heard a key turn in the
lock of the double door outside, and that
was all!

We looked at each other again without
speaking. Surely she must be a fairy of
some kind, after all!
      

      
CHAPTER IX.
OUR FAIRY.


"A creature not too bright or good
      For human nature's daily food."
Wordsworth.
      




t seemed a very long
time to the next
afternoon, and if
Liddy hadn't been
the most unnoticing
old woman in the
world, she would
certainly have seen
that there was something
unusual in our
heads. We could think
of nothing but our new friend the fairy,
or "the other princess," as Gerald would
call her. Who could she be? where had
she come from? how       and this, perhaps,
was the thing we wondered most about       how
in the world did she know all about us,
or our names, even down to our pet names,
any way?

Then another thought was in my mind
and Tib's. Grandpapa had told us to make
no friends with the neighbours. Would it
be disobeying him to go to meet the young
lady in the saloon and play with her, as she
had asked us?

"Is she a neighbour?" said Tib. "We
don't know       we don't know if she lives
there, or where she lives, or anything."

"We must ask her," I said; "any way,
we must go and see her again to ask her.
We must go to see her once, and we will
tell her what grandpapa said."

"I think she is a fairy, and that she lives
in Fairyland; and grandpapa didn't say
we weren't to speak to fairies," said
Gerald.

"Oh! how I wish Mr. Truro was here;
we could ask him about it," I said.

"And there's another thing," said Tib:
"we almost promised Mr. Truro we wouldn't
say anything about the palace and all that
to grandpapa just now       not till they came
again. It's rather a muddle altogether,
don't you think, Gussie?"

"I dare say she       we must get a name
for her, Tib              "

"We'd better just call her Regina," Tib
said. "She said it was her name."

"Well, I dare say Regina will tell us what
she thinks we should do. Any way, as you
say, we must go to see her once to tell her
about it. I wonder what the bell was that
rang, and made her rush off in such a hurry.
That part of it was really very like a fairy
story."

"If only she had left a slipper behind her,
it would have been a little like Cinderella,"
I said; "though the deserted, quiet rooms,
and that part of it, is more like the Sleeping
Beauty."

"And the first day, when we were trying
to get in at the door in the wall, was like
one of the stories of dwarfs and gnomes in
the woods, wasn't it?" said Tib. "We've
really had a good many adventures at
Rosebuds."

This conversation took place the morning
after we had first seen Regina. We were in
the schoolroom, waiting for Mr. Markham.
It was a little past his usual time when
he came in.

"I'm a little late, I fear," he said. "I
had to go to the Rectory to settle about
giving some holiday lessons to one of the
boys there. It will be Whit-week holidays
soon, you know."

We didn't care very much; Whit-week
would make no difference to us. Indeed,
Christmas itself we didn't look forward to
in those days, as most children do. It
brought no happy family meetings, no
Christmas-trees, or merry blind-man's buff
and snap-dragon to us. But we knew too
little about these things in other homes to
think about what we missed, and grandpapa
always gave us a pound each to spend as we
chose. And at Ansdell, the Christmases we
happened to be there, the servants had a
party, and we used to watch them from
the gallery that runs round the big hall.
But Whit-week we cared nothing about.

"We're not to have holidays, then, are
we?" I asked.

"Oh, no; Mr. Ansdell has said nothing
about it," Mr. Markham replied. "By the
by, Miss Gussie, you don't know when
he will be coming down again, do
you?"

"No," I said. "It won't be next Saturday,
and perhaps not the Saturday after."

"Ah well! I can write to him. I thought
perhaps he would say something for me to
the rector       you don't know the family at
the Rectory, I think?"

"No," said Tib.

"It is curious," said Mr. Markham       he
was rather talkative this morning; perhaps
it had put him into an extra good humour
to have the hope of some more pupils       "it
is curious       I saw a young lady there this
morning that I could really have thought
was an elder sister of Miss Tib's       she was
so very like her."

We were all ears and attention now.

"So like Tib?" said Gerald and I.

"So like me?" said Tib.

"Yes," repeated Mr. Markham, "exceedingly
like."

He didn't add, as I have done, "only a
great deal prettier." Perhaps it is because
Tib is my own sister, and I'm always seeing
her and know her face so well, that I don't
think her as pretty as other people do       or
rather, I don't think about it. When you
love people dearly you don't think about
whether they're pretty or not       even
now with Reg              Oh! I am too stupid
again.

"It is very funny," we said, in which
Mr. Markham agreed. He was thinking, of
course, that the likeness was curious; we
were thinking of far more than that       of
how strange it would be if our mysterious
lady was staying at the Rectory. If so,
how did she get into the saloon?       how
did she know our names?       how did she
know that we went there to play?

"Yes, I should like you to see it for
yourselves. But you don't know the
family there?"

"No," repeated Tib, rather sharply, "we
don't. Grandpapa doesn't wish us to make
any friends here."

"Oh, exactly       I beg your pardon," said
poor Mr. Markham. Probably grandpapa
had said something about it to our tutor
himself, which for the moment he had forgotten,
for he got rather red, poor young
man, and began rather hurriedly to get
the books ready. "We mustn't waste any
more time," he said, and, as we were sorry
to see him looking uncomfortable, we didn't
remind him, as we might have done, that
it was he, and not we, who had begun the
conversation.

It was a little later than usual when we
got out that afternoon. Nurse had kept us to
try on some new frocks she was making for us,
and we were very cross about it, I remember.
But after all, it didn't matter. When we
found ourselves at last in the saloon, and
looked round
eagerly, there
was no one to
greet us, but
the smiling
face of the
portrait       the same which
we had before thought so
lovely, but which now seemed uninteresting
and disappointing compared to the living,
changing, half-mischievous, half-tender face,
which already I really believe we had learnt
to love.

"She'll be coming soon, I dare say," said
Tib. "Let's sit down quietly, and think of
all we want to ask her, in case she makes
off in a hurry like yesterday," and we
were turning towards the end of the
room where stood all the old chairs and
couches, when something on one of the
marble consols caught our eyes. It was
something lightly covered with a sheet of
white tissue-paper, and lifting it up, there
were three little nosegays of lovely flowers       delicate,
brilliant hot-house flowers they
were, and each nosegay lay on a book, and
a card with writing on it was put so that
it could be seen at once on the middle
nosegay. The words on the card were
these:       

"For Tib, Gussie, and Gerald. I am so sorry I cannot
come to-day. The books are to amuse you instead, and
I will come again the first day I can.
"R."


We were very disappointed. Still, it was
very nice and funny to receive messages
and presents in this mysterious way. The
flowers were really beautiful, and the books
were chosen as if she had known us all our
lives. We knew at once which was for
which, by the way they were lying on the
table. Gerald's was about animals       stories,
I mean       and Tib's was Lamb's Tales from
Shakespeare, and mine was The Wonder
Book.

We sat down and looked at our books,
and scented our flowers       don't you think
it's very ugly to talk of smelling flowers?
we always say "scenting," though somebody
laughs at us for it, and says it isn't the
proper meaning of the word       and then we
all three made ourselves very comfortable in
different corners of the arm-chairs and
couches, and read our new stories. And
thus we spent the afternoon. It wasn't as
long a one as usual, for we had come so
late. But before we went away we got
into a great puzzle about how to thank her
for the books and flowers.

"It would be rude to go away and leave
no message," said Tib. "And she doesn't
say she'll come to-morrow, only 'The first
day I can.' Perhaps she'll come in the
morning, and look to see if we've taken
the books."

But not one of us had a pencil or a scrap
of paper in our pockets, though we turned
them inside out. Gerald had a top and
some nails, and an awful little pink and
white grimy ball that he called his "handkercher";
and Tib had her garden gloves,
and a rather clean handkerchief, and some
red wool with a crochet needle stuck
in it, as she was learning to crochet; and
I had nothing at all. What was to be
done?

"I know," I said; "you don't mind using
your wool, do you, Tib? Well, look here,
we'll write with it on the white marble,"
and I set to work, and very soon I had
written the words, "Thank you, kind fairy,"
to which Gerald made me add, "Come
soon," and our initials, "T" and two "G's."
It really looked quite pretty, and one
comfort was, there was no fear of any one
spoiling it before Regina saw it.

And then we went home, but we left our
new books in the conservatory, because we
shouldn't have known what to say if nurse
had asked us about them.

The next day, to our great vexation,
something prevented our going at all       I
forget what it was       oh no! I remember.
It was that nurse took us to the little town
where Mr. Markham came from, to get us
spring hats. She had got grandpapa's leave
to take us when he was at Rosebuds, and
she hadn't told us       poor old Liddy!       because
she thought it would be such a
delightful surprise.

It would have been a great treat if we
hadn't had our heads so full of Regina, and
wanting to see her again. But we were not
so unkind and selfish as not to look pleased
when nurse told us about it.

"How are we to go to the station?" I
asked, for nurse had said it was two stations
off by train, and when she said we should
walk to the station       it was quite fine, and
if it hadn't been fine we would have had to
wait for another day       we were very pleased.

"We can peep in at the Rectory garden
as we pass," I said to Tib, "and perhaps
we'll see the lady that's like you, whoever
she is. I wonder if she is Regina?"

"So do I," said Tib; "I wonder about
it altogether."

But though we stared in with all our eyes
at the garden of the pretty house next the
church, on our way to the station, there
was nobody to be seen.

"That is the Rectory, isn't it, nurse?"
Tib asked her.

"I suppose so, my dears," she replied,
rather nervously. "But I couldn't say for
certain, having been so little in the village."

She was always in such a fright, for fear
of getting to know any one or anything in
the village. It was rather stupid of her to
show it so, for it only put all grandpapa's
funny ways about it more into our heads,
but we didn't like to tease her, so we said
no more.

But on the way home we took another
peep in at the Rectory gates. Nurse was a
little way behind, loaded with parcels which
she wouldn't let us help her to carry; and
we ran on a little. It was easy to peep in
without being seen, but what we saw added
to our puzzle. A lady was walking up and
down the avenue with a book in her hand
which she was reading, and as she turned
our way, we saw her face clearly.

"Tib," I whispered, "she's like you, and
she's like Regina, too       only she's old. And,
Tib, she's like grandpapa."

So she was. She had the same straight-up,
rather proud way of holding herself as
he has, dark hair, which was beginning to
get grey, and those pretty blue eyes with
the bright eager look which all the blue
eyes among us have       yes, she was like
them all       the portrait, too. And just as
we were staring, there came a call from the
house, and an old, quite old, lady came to a
glass door which opened on to the terrace.
I knew afterwards that this old lady was
the clergyman's mother or his wife's mother,
who lived with them, and they have all
lived there a very long time.

"Regina, Queenie, my dear," the old lady
called out, "tea is ready. Frances wants
you to come in."

The lady turned quickly.

"I'm coming, Mrs. Leslie," she said, and
then she walked quickly to the house.

"Regina, another Regina!" we exclaimed.
"And Queenie: what a pretty name for a
pet name! I wonder our Regina didn't tell
us to call her 'Queenie.'"

For of course, as we had learned a little
Latin, we knew that Regina meant
"queen."

"We must ask her why she didn't," said
Gerald.

You can fancy how we looked forward to
the next afternoon, and how we hoped our
pretty lady would be there.

It all went right for once. Nurse was
more busy than usual about all the things
she had bought for us at Welford, and very
glad to get rid of us as soon as we had had
our dinner. For, happily, she had no trying-on
to do to-day.

"You may have a good long afternoon in
the garden," she said. "I must say you're
wonderful good children for amusing yourselves.
There's never any tease-teasing,
like with some I've known       'What
shall we do, nurse?' or, 'We've nothing
to play at.' And you're getting very
good, too, about never getting into
mischief. You're much better, Miss
Gussie, than you were last year at
Ansdell: for it was you as was the
ringleader."

"Yes," said I, not very much ashamed of
the distinction. "Do you remember the
day I took grandpapa's new railway rug to
make a carpet to our tent, and left it out
all night, and it rained and all the colour
ran? And do you remember when I pushed
Gerald into the pond to catch the little
fishes, and how he stood shivering and
crying?"

"Ah, yes, indeed," said nurse. "But
speaking of ponds       the one at Ansdell was
nothing; but those nasty pits or pools in
the fields near by: you never go near them?
Your grandpapa has a real fear of them,
and he told me not to let you forget what
he'd said."

"No fear," we all answered, "we never
go near them. We promised him we
wouldn't, nurse."

Then off we ran.

"Even if she isn't there, she's sure to
have left some message for us, like the last
time," said Gerald as we ran. "I wish
she'd bring us some butter-scotch."

"Gerald!" exclaimed Tib and I, "what
sort of ideas have you? Fairies and butter-scotch
mixed in the same breath. I only
hope," Tib went on, "that she won't think
we're ungrateful for the books, or that we
don't care for them, because we had to
leave them in the conservatory."

"If only she's there, we can explain
everything," said I.

And she was there.

Not waiting in the saloon this time, but
running down the long passage to meet us
as soon as she heard our steps, looking
prettier, and merrier, and sweeter than ever.
Dear Regina!

I have never minded her teasing since
that first day, when I really didn't understand
her. I shall never mind it again, I
am sure.

She led us into the big drawing-room,
where she had prepared another little surprise
for us. She was as pleased about it as
we were ourselves. It was more of Gerald's
kind of treat this time       not butter-scotch,
but fruit       grapes, and beautiful little
Tangiers oranges, and little cakes and
biscuits of ever so many kinds. They were
so nice, and we ate such a lot of them, and
Regina ate a good many herself.

"You see, though I am a fairy, I like
nice things," she said.

"Do you have afternoon luncheon every
day?" asked Gerald. "Oh, how I would
like to be you."

"Isn't he a greedy boy?" I said; and
then I told her about the butter-scotch, and
somehow the butter-scotch led to our talking
of grandpapa       you remember about
Gerald wishing he'd bring us some       and
then we all got rather grave, for we had a
great deal to tell our new princess, and to
ask her.

We sat together in a little group on one
of the arm-chairs, and Regina listened to us
very attentively. We told her all that
grandpapa had said to us before we came
to Rosebuds, and all about the book in the
library in London, and how we wanted to love
grandpapa better, as Mrs. Munt had told us
we should, but that it was rather difficult.
We told her all we had told Mr. Truro, only
more, for we had to tell her all about him
as well. And then we asked her if she
thought it was disobeying grandpapa for us
to come to see her; and when we had told
her all we could think of, we waited very
anxiously to hear what she would say.
Her face looked grave, though not exactly
sad.

"Your friend       Mr. Truro       told you to
wait till he came back again?" she
said.

"Yes, but that was only about coming in
here to play. We hadn't seen you then       and
grandpapa told us not to make friends
with any of the neighbours. Are you a
neighbour? Do you live here?"

"No," said Regina. "I live far from
here."

"And how can you come so often to see
us, then?" we asked.

She smiled.

"Can't you fancy I come on a sunbeam,
or a cloud, or on a broomstick if you like?
Or if I had only thought of taking the
picture away, you might really have
thought I had come out of the frame! No
children, I'm not going to tell you where I
come from, or how I come, or anything.
Then you can feel you're not hearing from
me anything your grandfather would not
wish you to hear, and when he and Mr.
Truro come here again, you can tell them
all       everything, and see what they say.
You can bring Mr. Truro here to see me, if
you like, and we'll talk it over. Now, as
who knows how seldom we may see each
other again, suppose we make the best use
of our time. I've got some games to teach
you       new games. Let us be as happy and
merry as we can be while we are together."

And you cannot fancy what fun we had.

She kept us playing, and guessing tricks
and riddles, and even singing little glees       she
had such a pretty voice       so busily that
we hadn't time to ask her any more
questions, and indeed forgot to do so. So
that when it grew late and we had to go
home, and Regina kissed us and said
good-bye, we knew as little about her, or
where she had come from or was going to,
as if she had really flown down to us from
some fairy country invisible to mortal eyes.

"And will you come again soon?" we
asked.

"Whenever I can, but that is all I can
promise," she said, and then she disappeared
behind the heavy doors, and we heard the
key turn in the lock on the other side.

And we went home, wishing it were
to-morrow.

"No, not to-morrow       she's sure not to
come so soon again, but, all the same, we
must come and see."
      

      
CHAPTER X.
THREE STARLINGS.

      "'I can't get out; I can't get out,' said the starling.
'God help thee,' said I; 'but I'll let thee out.'"
Sentimental Journey.      




he didn't come the
next day, but instead
of her we
actually found three
little packets of
butter-scotch tied up in
white paper, with a different
coloured ribbon on
each: mine was pink, and
Tib's blue, and Gerald's
green. I think nothing
that had happened to us pleased Gerald
as much as this, though he couldn't
pretend to think it had come from Fairyland.

And two days after that, the girl herself
came again, and we had another merry
afternoon of games and fun. How we
laughed! there never was any one as clever
as our new princess at games. And when
we were all too tired and hot to play any
more, she told us to sit down quietly to
rest, and to shut our eyes, and pretend to
go to sleep for five minutes. And when we
did so we heard a little faint rustling, and if
we had not promised I am sure we should
have opened our eyes, we were so afraid she
was tricking us, and running away without
saying good-bye.

But in a minute we heard the rustling
again.

"Open your eyes," said her voice, and
when we opened them, lo and behold! there
was a glass jug filled with lemonade       it
was so good       and four little tumblers, and
sponge cakes. The tumblers were red and
of a queer shape, and so was the big jug.

"These might have come from Fairyland,"
I said. "You know, Regina"       for
she would make us call her so       "Gerald
won't give up about you being a fairy;
only when it came to packets of butter-scotch              "

"Even he couldn't believe there were
butter-scotch manufactories in Fairyland,"
said she, laughing. And then we all
laughed just because we were so happy.

"We've never laughed so much in our
lives before, I don't think," said Tib.

"Poor little pets," said Regina, "it won't
do you any harm. It should do the old
house good too       it's many a long day since
it heard any merry voices."

"The old house," said I; "what do you
mean?"

"Why, the old house we're in       the place
where you are. Where do you suppose
yourself to be at this moment?" she asked,
seeing I looked more and more puzzled.

"I don't know," I said. "We thought it
was perhaps just this room, or else that it
was a sort of a palace. We never thought
of it as a regular house."

"A pavilion of some kind, I suppose you
mean," said she.

"Why do you call it the old house? Is
it very old?" asked Tib.

"Yes," said Regina, "it is. It has got
into being called the old house because it is
the oldest anywhere about, I suppose. And
then, you see, when people haven't lived in
a place for very, very long, they get into
that way of speaking of it       out of a sort of
affection       just as one speaks of the old
days, you know, when one speaks of long
ago."

"Did you live here long ago, and then
not for a great while?"

"No, I never lived here, and then I'm
not so old as all that. I heard about the
old days of course from              " but then she
got red, and stopped suddenly. "I think
it's time to go," she said.

"Wait a minute," said I; "will you show
us some of the rooms of the house? We
should so like to see them."

The new princess hesitated. Then she
shook her head. "No, dears," she said, "I'd
better not. Just try to keep to your old
fancies, and take Gerald's way: it's the best
just now. And now listen: this is Wednesday.
I can't come to-morrow. You'll
promise to come on Friday?"

"Yes," we all said.

"I particularly want you to come on
Friday," she went on, and her face grew a
little sad, "though I can't quite explain
why       except       just that after that perhaps
I can't see you for a good while."

"Oh! don't say that," we all cried
together; "do try and not let it be that
way. We will come on Friday, you may
be sure."

"But don't expect me very early," she
said. "I may not be able to come till
pretty late."

And then she kissed us all again, and she
went her way, and we ours.

It happened very well that she had asked
us to come on Friday, and not on Thursday,
for on Thursday it was so extra pouring
wet that nurse wouldn't let us go out at all.
And we were exceedingly anxious on Friday
morning to see what the weather was going
to be, and we were all delighted to see it
was fine.

"We must have a long afternoon to ourselves,
nurse," we said. "It's horrid to be
cooped up in the house all day."

"Well, I'm sure, my dears, I'm as sorry
as you can be when it has to be so," said
nurse. "But it's very wet everywhere
still to-day. It did pour so yesterday.
You must be sure to take your goloshes,
and to come in at once if you feel chilly
or shivery. I wouldn't for anything have
you take cold."

"We never do, nurse," Tib said. "You
must allow that we don't give you much
trouble about our being ill."

"As if I'd grudge any trouble, my dear,"
said Liddy       she was very matter of fact.
"But it's true you've given no trouble of
any kind since you've been here, and so I
shall tell your dear grandpapa       and so, I'm
sure, will Mrs. Munt. She thinks there
never were such children. But do be
careful now, dears, not to catch cold just
as your dear grandpapa's coming?"

"Grandpapa coming! You never told
us," we exclaimed. "When is he coming?"

"To-morrow; and Mr. Truro too. At
least, Mrs. Munt's sure it's him, though
Mr. Ansdell only says to prepare the same
rooms as last time. I meant to tell you
when we began speaking       Mrs. Munt just
got the letter this morning."

"What a good thing he's not coming to-day,"
we said to ourselves. "Nurse would
never have let us out at all, or else we would
have had to come in early, and she said she
couldn't come early. I wonder, Tib," I went
on, "I wonder if somehow her wanting us so
much to-day, and what she has said, has
anything to do with grandpapa's coming?"

"How could she know he was coming
before we knew it ourselves, even? Gussie,
it's not me that's too fanciful nowadays," said
Tib. "Of course, on our side, knowing he
was coming might have made us say perhaps
it would be the last time. You know we've
promised her and ourselves to tell Mr.
Truro all about her, and then he or we must
tell grandpapa, and who knows what he'll
say? It's to be hoped he's not so busy
and worried as he was when he was here
before."

But the thought that it might be the last
time we should see our pretty princess       that
grandpapa might even forbid our ever
going to our palace, as we still called it, at
all, made us rather sad and subdued, and
it was not as merrily as usual that we ran
through the tangle to the door in the wall.

"Be quick, Gerald," I said, when he had
got the key in the lock, and was turning
it       he always counted it his business;
"what are you pulling at?"

"It's stiff to-day       it may have got rusty
with it raining so yesterday," he said.
For we still always left the key in the
summer-house       we were afraid to take it
into the house. "It needs oiling again,
perhaps;" but he had managed to open the
door by this time, and he took the key out
of the lock as he spoke, and we all passed
through, Gerald locking the door again
inside, and leaving the key in the lock, as
we always did.

Regina was not yet there, but we were
not surprised: she had said she might be
late of coming, and we had not waited, just
for fear of nurse stopping us at the last
minute. We amused ourselves with some
of the puzzles she had brought and left for
us to play with when we were not inclined
for noisier games, and in about an hour, to
our delight, we heard the key turn in the
big door, and in came our princess, a basket
on her arm, which she set down on the
floor, while she locked the door inside, and
put the key in her pocket.

"You needn't do that," said Tib and I,
rather offended; "we're not going to try to
go out of the room, since you told us you
didn't want us to."

"I did it without thinking," said Regina.
"I know I can trust you. Now kiss me,
darlings, and let us be as happy as we can."

"But we're not very happy," we answered;
and then we told her that grandpapa
and Mr. Truro were coming the next day,
and that perhaps we wouldn't be allowed
to come to see her any more. She looked
sorry, but not very surprised.

"We must hope the best," she said.
"Mr. Truro is so kind, you say. Won't he,
perhaps, be able to get your grandpapa to
let you come?"

"Perhaps," we said. But it was only
"perhaps."


  
    
      
      
    
  
  
    Then as we weren't
much in the humour for games,
she sat and
told us stories.

But Regina wouldn't let us be sad. She
opened her basket, which was filled with
things she thought would please us, and we
had our afternoon luncheon, as Gerald
called it, together. Then as we weren't
much in the humour for games, she sat and
told us stories       such pretty ones, I wish I
could write some of them down, for
I believe she made them up out of her
head       till, feeling afraid it was getting
late, she looked at her watch, and
jumped up in a fright, like Cinderella
again.

"Darlings, darlings!" she cried, "I must
go," and she kissed us very lovingly, but
very hurriedly.

"And when are we to see you again?"

Regina shook her head.

"That is more for you to know than for
me," she said. "We must leave it this way       if
you can come again, you'll find some
message from me, and you can leave one for
me, and then I'll come."

"But listen," I said; "the other day
you said you weren't sure that you could
come, and to-day you didn't seem surprised
that perhaps we can't come. Regina, tell
me, did you know grandpapa was coming
before we did? Are you a fairy?"

She shook her head, laughing, but she
would say nothing, and in another moment
she was gone.

We sat still, talking, for some time after
she had gone       we couldn't help feeling dull
and sad. We were so afraid of what grandpapa
might say.

"It's a very good thing Mr. Truro's
coming," said Tib. "It would have been
too dreadful to have had to tell grandpapa
ourselves."

"I don't see that," I said. "You speak
as if we had done something very naughty,
that we should be ashamed of telling. I'm
not a bit afraid of telling grandpapa, in
that way; I'm only afraid for fear he should
forbid us ever to come to the old house
again;" we had left off calling it the palace,
since Regina had explained it was really a
house, and the "old house" sounded nice,
somehow.

"Well, yes," said Tib, "that's what I'm
the most afraid of too, of course."

"And there's something we can't understand
altogether," I went on. "Why did
grandpapa stop us knowing anybody here?
I'm sure the people at the Rectory would
be kind to us, and I daresay there are
other nice people. Then, who is Regina?
and how does she know about us? and
whose house is this? and why is it
shut up? and              " I stopped, out of
breath.

"And who is the portrait? and why is
it like her, and like me? And the lady at
the Rectory       the oldish lady, and the young
one Mr. Markham spoke of       who are they?
Oh yes, there are just thousands of things
we don't understand. I don't think I shall
ever wish for mysteries again," said Tib,
dolefully. "Just because Regina is so fond
of us, and we are so fond of her       just
because of that you may be sure we shall
never see her again."

At these words Gerald began to cry. I
was half vexed with him, and half sorry
for him.

"Don't cry, Gerald," I said; "though,
all the same, Tib, I don't see why you need
always make the worst of things. It may
be all right, Gerald dear       perhaps grandpapa
may not mind. And just think how
nice it would be to be able to have her to
come to see us at Rosebuds!"

Gerald began drying his eyes, for which
purpose another little grimy ball       this
time blue and white       was brought into
requisition.

"I'm sure I love her the best of us all,"
he said, as a sort of apology.

"You can't love her more than we do,"
said Tib and I, rather grumpily.

Then we began to think perhaps we had
better be going home. We had some lessons
still to do for Mr. Markham, and it must
be near tea-time, though we weren't very
hungry, on account of the afternoon luncheon
we had had.

We left the saloon with a lingering look at
all, especially at the old princess, as we now
called her       our first friend, whom we felt
we had rather neglected of late. There she
was, smiling as usual, with the sweet, but
slightly contemptuous smile she had always
worn       as if she knew herself to be above
all foolish weaknesses and changeablenesses,
and could afford to smile at them
amiably.

"Good-bye, princess," I said. "I don't
know if we shall ever see you again, but if
not, we thank you for your politeness to us,
though we can't pretend to say we love you
as much as our new princess."

"It isn't her fault, poor thing," added
Tib, "she can't help being only a picture
instead of a living person. And, Gussie,
she must have been a living person once;
I mean there must have been a person just
like her, and that person must have been
very like Regina. Isn't it sad to think that
there's nothing left of her except this cold
picture, always smiling the same, whatever
happens?"

"It's no more sad about her than about
any other picture," I said, rather crossly.
Sometimes I do get cross with Tib when she
is sentimental. I'm sure I don't know
why       it is ill-natured. "I wonder," I went on,
more eagerly, "I wonder if possibly she
could be the portrait of the oldish lady       when
the oldish lady was young, you know,
Tib, for she is so like Regina."

It was Tib's turn to snub me now.

"The portrait of that lady," she said.
"My goodness, Gussie! for it to be her portrait
she would need to be about a hundred
and twenty years old. Can't you tell
that by the dress, and the look of the
picture?"

"Well, never mind," I said. "We can't
find out anything about her, so it's no use
squabbling. We must go, Tib; I'm sure
it's late; and we don't want to do anything
that could vex nurse just as grandpapa's
coming, for you know he always asks her if
we've been good."

"Come along, then," said Tib.

We walked slowly down the long passage
and into the conservatory, where everything
looked just exactly the same as the first day
we had seen it.

"Oh dear, I am so unhappy!" said
Gerald, again. "I've got a feeling that all
the nice has finished."

"Open the door quick, Gerald, or let me
do it, and don't make things worse by talking
nonsense."

Gerald turned to the door       the key was
sticking in the lock, as I said       Gerald
always left it after locking it.

"Do be quick," said Tib, impatiently.

Whether it was her hurrying him that
made him awkward or jerky, or whether it
was just that something had gone wrong
with the lock or the key       you remember
we had noticed it was stiffer than usual
when we came in       I can't say. But, however
that may have been, this is what
happened. The key wouldn't turn in the
lock! Gerald fumbled at it for some time,
then Tib and I got impatient.

"What is the matter?" said Tib.

"What are you doing?" said I; and we
both ran forward, pushing poor Gerald aside,
and each trying to get hold of the key. We
each took a turn at it, like the first day,
only now our flurry and fear made us less
cool and careful. It was no use; we
pressed, and pulled, and tugged, we took
the key out, and rubbed it and cleaned
it as if we had been Bluebeard's wife, and
put it back again to try afresh. No use!

"I really think keys have got spirits in
them sometimes," said Tib. "They are so
contrary."

And then, hot and worried, beginning to
be frightened too, we looked at our sore
fingers, which the horrid key had bruised
and scratched, and asked ourselves what
to do.

Tib started forward again       she had spied
a strong bit of stick in a corner.

"I believe it's only stiffness, after all,"
she said. "There can't be anything the
matter with the key."

She seized the stick       it was a very stout
one       ran it through the ring of the key,
and before Gerald and I really knew what
she was doing, she had grasped the two
ends with her two hands, and was turning
vigorously.

"Ah! I told you so," she cried, as she
felt that the stick did turn, "it only
wanted some strength. But oh, Gussie! oh,
Gerald!" she screamed the next moment,
"see, see!"

She drew back a little       we did see       the
key had broken, not turned! the ring was
still hanging on the stick; the useless end
of the key stuck out of the lock as if in
mockery.

"Oh, Tib!" I cried, for somehow one's
first feeling always is to blame some one,
"why were you so hasty? Oh dear! what
shall we do?"

Tib was too subdued to resent my blame.

"It wouldn't turn before," she said
meekly. "Perhaps we are no worse off
than before."

"Yes, we are," I said angrily. "Then, at
least, we could take the key out and shout
through the key-hole. Now we can't even
do that," for I had tried, and found that
there was now no moving the key the least
little bit. There really was nothing to be
done. But we did not realise that all at
once. We set to work shouting and kicking
on the door, in hopes that somebody might
be passing by the tangle, though nothing
was more unlikely. We climbed up on the
shelves of the conservatory, in hopes somebody
might be in that garden       the garden
of the old house, as we now knew it to be.
But very little was to be seen       only some
grass stretching towards a belt of trees, and
no sign of anybody       it wasn't till afterwards
that we knew there was another door into
the conservatory, concealed in a corner       a
door for gardeners to come in by, but it
hadn't been used for many years, and the
key was lost, so the knowledge wouldn't
have done us much good       and we gave up
that hope in despair.

Then another idea struck us       we ran
back to the saloon to try the door by which
Regina came in. If possibly she hadn't
locked it, we might get into the house, and
out through it, and so home. But no       the
great double doors were as firm as a rock.
Regina had locked them only too securely!

"She might have left it unlocked," we
said, in a sort of unreasonable rage; "she
might have thought perhaps we might
need to get out this way." And then we
remembered that she had been used to see
us coming in and out quite easily. She
had had no reason for any misgiving.

"But there may be some one in the
house," said Tib. So again we set to work
calling, and knocking, and banging at the
doors. In vain       in vain! We were completely
locked in, and evidently there was
no one near enough to hear us.

Tired out at last, we sat down, huddled
together, on one of the arm-chairs, where
we had sat so happily with Regina.

"We must stay all night," I said.

"Till the dusting person comes in the
morning," said Tib.

"Any way, it's a good thing we had some
afternoon luncheon," said Gerald, though
even this consoling reflection did not
prevent the tears rolling down his poor
fat cheeks.

We didn't as yet feel hungry       nor did
we feel exactly frightened, though it did
begin to feel "eerie." But very soon we
felt very cold. It is strange how cold an
unused room gets to feel as soon as the
bright daylight goes. We had our jackets
on, fortunately, and we took some of the
linen covers off the chairs, and wrapped
them round us, so that we looked like
ghosts or dancing dervishes. And thus
enveloped, we huddled together as close as
we could.

And the last thing we saw as the light
faded, so that everything in the room grew
dim and shadowy, was the calmly smiling
face of the "old princess" up above us on
the wall.

I never see it now without remembering
that strange evening.
      

      
CHAPTER XI.
BROTHER AND SISTER.


"For this relief, much thanks."       Hamlet.
      





y story is getting
rather
difficult to
manage now.
Indeed, I don't
quite see how to
do. I think, if I
had known how
long it would be,
and what a lot of
half-holidays I should have to stay in to
write it, I think I would never have begun
it. But I won't be laughed at for "beginning,
and not ending." And if I get
it rather muddley, and can't do it the way
authors do who know how to plan stories,
and write them so that they seem all to
come of themselves, like flowers growing,
you good people, whoever you are, that come
to read it must forgive me and believe
I did my best.

But I can't go on regularly the "I" way
now. That is what puzzles me. I have to
be, as it were, in three places at once. First
of all       we three are all locked up in the old
house now       I must tell you what was
happening at Rosebuds.

Nurse didn't miss us for a good while;
she was busy helping Mrs. Munt, as there
was always a good deal of fuss when grandpapa
was expected. And just as they were
getting things pretty ready, and nurse
would have begun seeing about our tea, up
comes a man from the telegraph office at
Welford with the usual brown envelope and
pink paper inside, addressed to Mrs. Munt,
to say that grandpapa was coming that
evening, would be there about eight o'clock.
Immediately, of course, all the bustle and
fuss began over again, only twice as bad;
for Mrs. Munt had to get a dinner ready all
in a hurry, and to send one running this
way and another that way for all the things
needed. Nurse went with her to the
kitchen, calling to Fanny to take up our
tea, and see that we got it properly; you
can understand that, just thinking of us as
at play in the garden, it never occurred to
nurse to ask if we were in, or to feel the
least anxious. Fanny, on her side, wasn't
at all given to being anxious about anything
except her own bonnets and caps, so she
merely set the tea, and then, "supposing"
we were up stairs, and would come down
when we heard the bell, off she went to her
own room and her bonnets.

But the tea got cold in the teapot, the
bread-and-butter was untouched, the honey
was at the disposal of all the flies who chose
to sip it       we three never came! And when
nurse, after helping Mrs. Munt till the two
old bodies were satisfied that all would be
right, trotted up to the schoolroom to put
us in order next, there was no one to be
seen! Just at first, I fancy, she was more
vexed than frightened.

"Dear, dear!" says I (this is nurse, you
understand, telling it over to me afterwards),
"where can they be, the naughty children?
But I wasn't not to say afraid of anything
wrong. I called Fanny, idle girl that she
is, and sent her out into the garden to look
for you, never doubting but that in two
minutes she'd be back with you all."

But when Fanny, after considerably more
than two minutes, reappeared with the
news that we were nowhere to be seen, then
poor nurse was dreadfully upset. She ran
to Mrs. Munt, and the two trotted everywhere
about the grounds, giving the alarm
to the gardener and his boy, who joined
them in the search.

It was getting near the time for grandpapa's
arrival. The dog-cart had started
for the station before our absence had been
discovered, and to add to her own great
anxiety, nurse had the fear of grandpapa's
driving in every moment and demanding
what was the matter. It must really have
been a terrible evening for both nurse and
Mrs. Munt; and as time passed and grandpapa
did not come, their fear of his displeasure
gave way to the wish that he were
there to advise and direct them what
to do.

They had exhausted all their energies
when at last       about nine o'clock       the dog-cart
appeared with him. He had missed
the train which stopped at our little station,
and had come on by the next       an express,
by which he was obliged to get out at
Welford. So he had telegraphed to the
groom to drive on, and meet him there
instead.

Mrs. Munt met him at the door; a
moment before, she had been at the gate,
but when she heard the dog-cart approaching,
she hurried back to the house. Not
even her fears of every kind could set
aside her ideas of what was proper and
respectful.

"God grant Mr. Truro may be with
master!" she said to herself, and her heart
sank still lower when she saw that grandpapa
was alone.

"Good evening, Mrs. Munt," he said,
as he got down; "you will have been
wondering what has become of me," and then
he quickly explained what had happened.
But receiving no distinct reply, he looked
at her, and saw that she was crying.

"What's the matter?" he said. "Are
the children ill?"

"Oh, sir!" she exclaimed, "oh, my dear
master, I only wish I knew!" and then she
told him of our strange disappearance.

He listened, but for some time he could
not believe it was quite as she said.

"They are hiding somewhere to trick
you, you may be sure," he said.

"But they'd never keep it up so long, sir,"
she replied. "Nine o'clock at night       their
bedtime, and had nothing to eat since their
dinner at one. Oh no, sir       I wish I could
think it       but it's not in the nature of children
to keep it up so long. And not of
those dear children: they'd have come out
wherever they were, on hearing poor nurse
and me a-praying and a-begging of them to
come out."

Grandpapa did not speak, but Mrs. Munt
saw that he began to take it seriously. He
would not go into the house till every
corner of the grounds had again been
searched under his own eye. And not the
grounds only, but the house; and when at
last there was nowhere else to look, and
grandpapa had shouted to us in every tone       scolding,
appealing, entreating       fancy
him entreating       us to give some sign of
life, promising not to be angry, never
again to be vexed with us whatever we did,
if we would but answer: when everywhere
had been searched, and everything said and
done that could be thought of, poor grandpapa,
looking quite old and shaky all of a
sudden, sat down by the table in the
dining-room, where his dinner was so neatly
set out, and buried his face in his hands.

It was terrible, both nurse and the old
housekeeper told us       terrible to see the
cold, strong man so overcome, and to hear
what he murmured to himself.

"All that I had left       all," he said. "My
own children, for she was as my daughter
to me, and my poor boy       one gone, one to
have deceived me. And now, in my old
age, these little creatures whom I was
learning to love! Is it my fault? Was I
too harsh to them? Did I neglect them?
Why is it that all belonging to me seem
doomed in some way?"

And then he raised his poor white face,
and told what he was thinking.

"Munt," he said, abruptly, "I have refused
to allow the idea in my mind       but it
must be the truth. I have tried not to
entertain it, for I knew if it were the case,
there was nothing to be done. It is so
dreadfully deep              " and he gave a little
shudder. "They must have fallen into the
pits at the corner of the Old House fields.
I had a presentiment of it from their first
coming here. Tell the man to fetch the
ropes       there must be the right thing in the
village, for cows have fallen in before now;
those pools must be dragged."

Mrs. Munt gave a little scream. Then
she grew quiet again.

"No, sir," she said, "the dear children
are too obedient for that. They remembered
what you said to them about not
going to those pits, and they repeated
their promise to nurse only a day or two
ago."

Grandpapa looked up with a gleam of
hope. But it faded again, and he only
repeated the words       

"Those pools must be dragged. Send
the men. I can do no more."

Then he half fell back upon his chair, and
stayed thus       almost unconscious, Mrs.
Munt thinks       while she went away to obey
his orders, till              

But now I must take up another end of
the story.

The family at the Rectory went early to
bed as a rule, even when they had visitors
with them. This eventful evening they
and their two visitors were just standing
about the drawing-room, preparing to say
good-night and to light their bed-room
candles, when they were startled by a loud
violent ringing at the door.

"Dear me," said they all, "what can that
be? So late, too; it is past ten."

"Some one ill, and wanting me, possibly,"
said the rector, and he went out to the hall,
where the footman was already at the door,
leaving the four ladies       his mother-in-law,
and Mrs. Lauriston, his wife, and the two
visitors       looking at each other rather
startledly. Still, there was no reason to
expect anything wrong       all the young
Lauristons were upstairs safe in bed their
mother remembered with satisfaction.

They heard voices at the door       then
the rector came back, looking shocked and
troubled.

"I must go out," he said; "a sad, a
terribly sad thing is supposed to have
happened."

"Where? Any of our people?" exclaimed
his wife.

Mr. Lauriston hesitated       he glanced at
the two stranger ladies       at the elder one
especially       the lady Tib and I had seen
from the Rectory gate.

"You must hear it sooner or later," he
said; "I'm very sorry to have to tell it. It
is at       at Rosebuds       the children there,
poor Gerald's children       are missing, and it
is feared they have fallen into the pits       near       near
your house, Mrs. Mowbray.
They have sent to me for the things to drag
with." (There was a pond almost big
enough to be called a little lake in the
Rectory grounds: that was how they had
ropes there.)

Mrs. Mowbray gave a scream.

"The children       drowned!" she cried in
an agony. "Oh, Edith! oh, William! if it
is so, it is my fault. I should not have left
these pits to be filled up by Farmer Jackman
when he buys the place. The moment
I knew the children were at Rosebuds,
I should have done it. Oh God! it is
too awful, and too cruel       just when
I was beginning, faintly beginning, to
hope."

She seemed as if she were going to faint.
But her daughter, our Regina, our dear
fairy, darted from the room, calling out as
she did so       

"Wait a moment, dear mamma. Don't
be so miserable. It may be a mistake."

She rushed to the hall, where stood the
Rectory servants in a group, and Barstow,
grandpapa's very spruce, stuck-up London
groom, who had come to ask for the ropes,
with a very solemn face, but very proud, all
the same, to be the centre of information.
Regina seized hold of him by the coat collar,
I believe; he told nurse afterwards that the
young lady shook him, shook him hard, "as
if it was all my fault," he said to nurse.

"Leave off chattering and gossiping," she
said, for our princess can be very determined
when she likes, "and attend to me.
Are the children known to be in the pool?
Were they seen near there? or heard? or
how is it?"

"Oh no, bless you, Miss," said Barstow,
shaking himself free rather resentfully.
"It's only that they're not to be found
nowhere else. They've been out a-playing
in the garden, as everybody thought, since
two or three o'clock, and they've never come
home, and they're nowhere to be found;
and my master       Gerald Ansdell, Esq., M.P.,
if you please, Miss,"       for Regina and all the
Rectory folk were perfect strangers to him
"my master has got it in his head that
the young ladies and Master Gerald is       has       must
be drowned, Miss, to speak
plain."

Regina dashed back to the drawing-room.

"Mamma darling, it's all right. Mr.
Lauriston, Mrs. Lauriston, all of you, help
me to explain. I know where the children
are       they're locked in, in the Old House       that's
all that's wrong       I'm sure of it. It
was a little plan of Charles Truro's and
mine; we thought if I got to know the
dear little things it might lead to something       to
a reconciliation. They had found their
way there by themselves, and told him about
it. But I must go at once to let them out,
the poor darlings. And, mamma, mamma,
take courage       seize the moment. While I
fetch them, you go to Uncle Ansdell and
tell him the good news. You may never
have such a chance again. Don't you think
so, Mr. Lauriston       you who know the whole
story       oh, do say you think she should do
it?" and Regina wrung her hands in her
eagerness.

It took a little cross-questioning to make
them understand all; but Regina got her
way. Barstow, to keep him quiet, was
allowed to go off with the gardener to get
the drags, and in less time than you would
have thought it possible they all set off       Mr.
Lauriston, Regina, and her mother.
But at the gate of Rosebuds they separated.
Regina hurried on down the lane with the
rector, her mother with trembling, shaking
steps, went in and made her way up to the
porch.

The front door stood open; in the confusion
and excitement nobody had thought
of closing it.

Grandpapa       poor grandpapa       was sitting
as Mrs. Munt had left him when she went
off to give orders about dragging the pools.
A little noise, the door softly opening and
closing again, made him look up. A tall
figure, all dressed in black, with a white,
sweet, anxious face and blue eyes, like Tib's
and grandpapa's own, streaming with tears,
stood beside him. He stared at it half
stupefied. I think he thought he was
dreaming. But it spoke.

"Brother, dear, dear brother, it is I.
Do you know me       will you forgive me
at last? Oh, dear, dear brother, forgive
me."

He gazed at her as if he did not see
her.

"I do not know why you have come,"
he said. "Do you know what has happened?
My children       poor Gerald's children       are
drowned, all of them. I am quite alone in
the world."

"No, no," she cried, "they are not
drowned. They will be here in a few
minutes. It was that gave me courage to
come       to bring you the good news. Gerald,
for their sake, for the dear children's sake,
won't you at last forgive me and let me
help you with them? Oh, I will love them
so if you will let me. Brother, say quick
before they come       say you will forgive me
at last. I have so suffered, I have been
punished so long. Brother, say you forgive
your poor Queenie."

She half knelt, half sank down beside him       all
I am writing is from what Regina has
told me, and her mother herself told her       grandpapa
stretched out
his arms, and she flung
herself into them.

"Queenie, my
little Queenie,"
he said, "you
have brought
me the good
news       is
it true,
quite
true?"

Auntie       that is, of course, what she is
to us       auntie was almost frightened. He
was so gentle, so clinging, and unlike his
usual cold decided self. And a sort of
terror went through her for a moment,
"Suppose it didn't turn out to be true that
we were safe."

"I should never forgive myself, never,"
she thought, "if I have raised his hopes
only for them to be dashed again;" and
even while she went on repeating that it
was true, he would see us directly, she
trembled.

But there came a noise       a very slight,
distant sound at first       of many voices and
steps approaching. Auntie's ears are quick,
and that evening they were quicker than
usual, even. She heard it ever so far off,
long before grandpapa heard anything. And
she listened, trembling. Were the voices
cheerful?       was it all right?

I have so often heard all the story of that
evening       of other people's part of it, I
mean       that I seem to be able to see it all
for myself as it must have looked to them.
I can so picture auntie standing there,
scarcely daring to breathe in her anxiety to
hear! And the first thing that quite
reassured her was Regina's voice speaking
in a pitying, petting, yet laughing way to
Gerald.

"My poor old man! no one will be vexed
with you for crying, for, as you say, you
are only seven years old." Of course,
in Gerald's troubles he had begun his
old cry!

And in another moment the dining-room
door opened and a queer-looking group
appeared. There was Regina in a shawl
thrown over her head, she had not waited to
put on her hat; there was Mr. Lauriston and
two or three gardeners and people we had
gathered on the way       for, of course, we had
come round by the proper entrance to the
Old House, and had found them all at the
pit       and in the middle of the crowd three
very dishevelled-looking little figures, with
eyes swollen with crying, and now blinking
at the sudden light, who rushed forward to
grandpapa, calling out all together       

"Oh! dear grandpapa, please forgive us.
We didn't mean to disobey you."

And before we knew where we were he
had us all in his arms at once, and he was
hugging us as he had never hugged us
before.

"My children," he said, "my dear little
children."

But when he looked up and saw Regina,
he really did start.

"Is it              ?" he began, and then he
looked round at auntie. "It is yourself
over again," he said, "it is you, Queenie       as
I last saw you."

Fancy that; fancy the years and years
that had gone by since they had met! How
very, very strange it must have seemed.

But auntie explained who Regina was,
and then grandpapa kissed her too, with a
curious wistful look in his eyes. And then
came hurrying in nurse and Mrs. Munt, whom
the good news of our return had just
reached, and we were bundled off to bed,
where we each had some nice hot stuff to
drink, and Regina explained all the queer
story to the two old servants, while down
stairs grandpapa and auntie were together
alone. And all that they had to tell and
ask of course we would never expect to
hear, but still, we had enough told to us to
make all that had puzzled us plain, and
to clear away all remains of our family
"mystery."

This I will tell you in the next chapter.
And I will also explain to you how Regina
had come to know of our having found
our way into the Old House, the hopes
that this had put into her head       hopes
which had been more than fulfilled, thanks
to the accident with the key, which had
so strangely turned to good.
      

      
CHAPTER XII.
THE STORY OF THE OLD HOUSE.

t all seemed like a
dream the next
morning. We
slept much later
than usual, for
we were quite
tired out. I can
never even now think
of that evening       shut
up in the dark in the
big bare room       without
a sort of shudder. It really was dreadful:
we were so cold that when we did fall asleep
it was only to wake again with a start
to find ourselves shivering and aching.
And it was frightening, too: though we
squeezed together as close as we could,
we felt dreadfully alone. And alone we
really were; for, as we understood afterwards,
there was nobody at all in the Old
House. The person who dusted it was the
woman who lived at the lodge, and only
came up in the mornings. Regina had
taken her a little into her confidence. The
day she hurried away when a bell rang,
it was the woman ringing to let her know the
Rectory pony-carriage was coming up the
lane. Auntie knew that Regina came to
the Old House, but she thought it was
just to wander about the garden, and that
day she had promised to call for her at
the lodge. For the Old House belonged
to auntie: it had belonged to the Mowbrays
for a very, very great many years. And
this brings me to the story of the long-ago
troubles which we were told       the
story which explained everything which
had puzzled us.

It was Mrs. Munt who told it us. She
came into our room       Tib's and my room       that
morning before we were up       we
had had our breakfast in bed       and sat
down between our cots.


  
    
      
      
    
  
  
    It was Mrs. Munt who told it us.

"My dears," she began, "your dear
grandpapa and       and my dear lady, Mrs.
Mowbray, Miss Queenie as was       they have
asked me to tell you something of the past,
so that you may understand all. It is a
great honour they have done me, and I
will endeavour to show that I feel it such.
But oh," and here she fairly broke down,
"this is a happy, a blessed day       to see them
at one again, and oh, my dears, it was a
happy day that brought you to Rosebuds,
for all the anguish of heart of Mrs. Liddy
and myself last night, we shall never but
be thankful to the over-ruling powers as
directed the finding of the key, and your
innocent minds to the Old House."

At this point Mrs. Munt stopped. It
was a sort of little address which she thought
it her duty to make, and after this, she
went straight on.

"It is a many years ago," she said,
"that it all happened. When I first came
to Rosebuds as a young girl to help in the
cooking, there was living here your grandpapa,
then a little boy of ten, and his
brother Baldwin, and Miss Mary, with their
mother, and their father, who was on the
point of going abroad with his regiment.
Not long after he left, Miss Regina was
born; then came the news of your great-grandpapa's
death, and the shock affected
your great-grandmamma so much that she
never recovered it. She died a year or
two after, Master Baldwin being by that
time preparing for the army, for he was
five years older than Master Gerald, and
Miss Mary older than he. Miss Mary took
charge of things with a lady to help her.
You can fancy that everybody was devoted
to Miss Regina, Master Gerald especially.
Some years later, Ansdell Friars came to
Master Baldwin, by his uncle's death. He
came home from time to time, and we used
to spend a part of the year there, but it never
seemed home to us, like Rosebuds. Your
grandpapa married young       he was about
twenty-four, and Miss Queenie was thirteen.
Poor Miss Mary died the year before his
marriage; you have seen her tomb at
Ansdell, and it seemed well to him to
marry, to have a lady at the head of things,
him having so much charge like, for his
brother. And your papa was born when
Miss Queenie was about fifteen. Your
grandpapa's marriage was a very happy one;
Mrs. Ansdell was a very sweet lady, and
suited him well. She had not half the
spirit nor the cleverness of Miss Queenie,
and she gave in to her husband, and she
joined with him in thinking there never
was so beautiful a creature as Miss Queenie.
How they did spoil her! Poor Master Gerald       your
papa, my dears, seemed nobody
and nothing in the family, compared with
his auntie, though he was a dear little boy.
Well, to explain       next door to Rosebuds,
as you now understand, is the Old House.
It is a far finer and larger place than this,
and it has always belonged to the Mowbrays,
who are cousins of the Ansdells, by a Miss
Regina Mowbray having married an Ansdell       your
grandpapa's grandmother she was,
as well as I can remember. It is her picture
that hangs in the big drawing-room       "

"The old princess!" we exclaimed, at
which Mrs. Munt smiled       "and," she went
on, "it is from her, they always say, that
comes the beauty       the dark hair and blue
eyes, the Ansdells are, so to say, proud of.
Well,"       Mrs. Munt here hurried on a little,
I think she thought it not good for us to
say much about family beauty; it didn't
matter to me, with my shaggy light hair,
and browny-greeny eyes, but Tib is different       "the
families at the two houses were
very intimate       that door in the wall was
made in the Old House conservatory as a
short cut for the young ladies to run in
and out by       they and the rectory family,
this Mr. Lauriston's uncle it was then, but
this one was a great deal there, were all
most friendly. At the Old House there
were some sisters       one is living still, being
Mr. Truro's mother       and two brothers.
The eldest brother was a nice gentleman,
just everything a gentleman should be,
and your grandpapa was delighted when
he spoke to him for Miss Queenie. Miss
Queenie laughed and made fun of it, but in
the end she said 'yes,' and all would have
been well       for he was a gentleman no woman
could have failed to care for as a husband       had
not the younger brother come home on
leave. He had not seen Miss Queenie since
she was grown up, for he was a sailor, and
had been long away. He was handsome,
and had a taking way with him       a sort of
dash about him, and he was selfish and
false. He fell in love with her, and persuaded
her that she had fallen in love with
him, and rather than be open about it, bad
as it was to have lured her away from his
brother, he made it worse by getting her to
run away with him, and not let any one
know where they were, till he wrote to say
they were married. My dears, from that
day till yesterday, your grandpapa and she
never met again."

"Was he so angry?" we asked.

"Anger is no word for it. He was
turned to stone to her. The deceitfulness       that
was always his cry. Poor
Mr. John Mowbray       his great friend, the
one who had really the most to complain
of, was far gentler, though it broke his
heart. He never married, and at his death,
two years ago, all came to your auntie
as his brother's widow, for Mr. Conrad,
the brother, was dead. That is how the
Old House is now your auntie's, but she
has never lived there. She could not bear
it, seeing her brother would not forgive her,
and she had made up her mind to sell it,
and came to stay at the Rectory to get it
all arranged. It was partly hearing it was
going to be sold, made your grandpapa think
of coming here again at last       he thought it
was all quite settled, and no fear of any one
coming about. For he has not even had
any friendliness with the Rectory folk all
these years; the old rector spoke to him
before he died, and begged him to forgive
Miss Queenie, but it only made him harder.
He would never hear her name       he scored
it out wherever he came across it in a
book       "

"Oh, yes, we saw that in London," we
interrupted.

"Nothing," continued Mrs. Munt, "but
the sight of her poor, sweet, worn face
would have changed him, and to think that
she should have been the one to tell him the
good news last night       it is indeed wonderful
how it has come about."

"Was auntie very unhappy with that
man       the one she married?" asked Tib in
a low voice. Mrs. Munt looked sad and
grave.

"My dears," she said, solemnly, "no
good comes of ill-doing. The man who
deceived his kind brother, who set himself
to wile a girl away from her truest and best
friends, was not the man to make a good
husband. She must have suffered more
than you       or we, maybe       could understand.
But it is past, and you need never
think of it again, except as a warning.
Your dear auntie may tell you more herself
as you grow older. But for me, I think I
have done my part; and, indeed, I could
almost feel the work of my life is near its
end now I have lived to see my dear master
and his best-loved sister united again,"
and poor Mrs. Munt wiped her eyes as she
kissed us, and said we might get up now       we
were to go to the Rectory to luncheon.

You will be glad to hear that she is living
still, and likely to live for many peaceful
years to come.

We were, of course, very much interested
in all she had told us. It took some time
to get it quite straight and clear in our
heads, especially as we felt that we should
not much like to talk over the saddest parts
of it with any one but ourselves: not even
with Regina, for, of course, the man who
had brought so much misery to them all       Mr.
Conrad Mowbray       was her father (I
am not going to let her read this last
chapter if I can help it); and even about
dear auntie, we felt it would not be kind to
talk about it to Regina       though now I can
scarcely fancy even Regina herself feeling
more tender about anything and everything
to do with her mother than Tib and I, who
are really only her grandnieces, do.

We were at the same time in a hurry to
get dressed, and go down stairs, and yet a
little afraid.

"Last night I wasn't afraid of grandpapa,"
said Tib; "we seemed all worked
up, so that only the realest feelings mattered.
Little top feelings, like being shy and all
that, seemed pushed away."

I didn't answer for a moment. I was
thinking over what she said.

"Do you think our being afraid of grandpapa
and fancying we don't love him is only
a top feeling after all?" I said.

"Yes," said Tib, "I do. Anyway, I'm
going to love him now. Perhaps, if he has
so many to love him now       auntie and
Regina, and you and me       all at once, the
lot of it will make up for his having had so
little all these years. Things come like that
sometimes, I suppose."

While we were talking       we took a good
while to dress, for we wanted to be very
neat to go to the Rectory       there came a
tap at the door, and in walked Gerald, as
cool as a cucumber.

"I'm ready," he said, and indeed one
could see by the scrubby look of his cheeks
that he had had an extra amount of soap.
"I've got my best suit on to go to the
Rectory."

"But, Gerald," said Tib, "don't you want
to hear all about how it's all been. Gussie
and I can tell you," for I forgot to say that
Mrs. Munt had told us we had better explain
a little to him. "Don't you want to
know why the Old House that we called the
palace was shut up, and how it comes
to be auntie's, and how she is our auntie,
and       "

"No," interrupted Gerald. "I don't
want to know anything. It puzzles me.
I'm only seven years old."

We looked at him in astonishment. Then
we fairly burst out laughing.

"I never saw such a boy," said Tib.
"You're so lazy, Gerald, you won't even let
your mind work enough to understand about
your own family."

"I do understand all I need," said
Gerald; "I understand that we've got an
auntie, and that she's very kind, and that
Regina is a cousin, and she's very nice too       so
nice that I'm still going to think she's
a fairy. That's what I've settled, and I
think it's quite enough when I'm only
seven."

And from that day to this I have never
heard him express any curiosity or make
any inquiries as to all that had happened.
I fancy Gerald will get through life
comfortably       though to do him justice he
is working very well at school, and doesn't
seem to be considered lazy at all.

Tib and I had still enough questions to
ask to make up for his not asking any.
We were in a fever to see Regina, and very
glad when Gerald ran up stairs again to say
that she had just driven over in the Lauristons'
pony-carriage to fetch us, and was
waiting downstairs, and we hurried down
as fast as we could.

"But what about grandpapa?" said Tib,
as we got to the first landing. "Should we
not go to say good morning or something
to him?"

I hesitated, but just at that moment we
heard his voice. He was standing in the
porch talking to Regina. You can't think
how funny it seemed. When he heard us
he came into the hall and met us at the
foot of the stairs. Then he kissed us each,
in a way he had never kissed us before. It
was like saying, "You understand all now.
Let us begin a new life together;" though
his said words were only, "Good morning,
my dear children. Are you all quite well
and not tired now?"

"Quite well, thank you, dear grandpapa,"
and I am sure he understood "between the
lines," as people say of a letter meaning
more than it shows.

"I wish you could come with us, Uncle
Gerald," said Regina, as we were driving
off.

"Thank you, my dear, but I am very
busy," he said. There was a look in his
eyes to her that I had never seen before.

"But Charlie will be here this afternoon,
and he does help you, doesn't he?" she
said.

"Very much," grandpapa replied.

We looked back at him, standing there
in the doorway.

"Grandpapa is changed since last night,"
said Tib.

"How?" said Regina, anxiously. "You
don't think he's ill?"

"No," said Tib, "though he does look
very pale. But his face seems older and
yet younger. It has got a sort of softer look,
as if at last he wasn't going to fight against
himself anymore, but that it has tired him."

"Yes," said Regina, "I understand. Then
you understand now       you and Gussie?"

"Yes," we answered. "Mrs. Munt has
told us a great deal. But there are some
things only you can tell us, and we want
dreadfully to ask you."

"Fire away," said Regina, and she did so
laugh when we didn't understand her; for,
of course, though she had never had any
brothers or sisters, she hadn't lived the
shut-up way we had done.

"We want to know," we began, "how
you knew about us going to the       the Old
House, and how you knew our names and
about us altogether."

"It was Charlie Truro that told me about
you," she said. "He is my cousin as
much       no, a good deal more       than he is
yours, and we have always been a great
deal together. He has known what a
terrible sorrow it was to mamma to be
estranged from her only brother, and he
and I have often planned what we could
do. We were very glad when Uncle
Gerald agreed to take him as a sort of
secretary for a while       it seemed a sort of
beginning."

"I wonder grandpapa ever did," I said.
"Wasn't it rather a wonder? For he
knew he was a near cousin of yours, I
suppose?"

"Yes," said Regina, "but it came about
naturally enough, through some friends
who had no connection with us. And once
he had seen Charlie, Uncle Gerald seems to
have taken a fancy to him. We came down
here to stay at the Rectory, not knowing
any one was at Rosebuds. Your coming
was kept very quiet. Then Charlie told us
of it, when he wrote, and when he came
down here he managed to come to see us
one day       a Sunday it was       at the Rectory,
and told us all about you. And to me,
though to no one else, he told of your
funny trouble, about having got into the
Old House and wondering if it was naughty,
and then we planned together       he and I       that
I should meet you there. I don't
know exactly what I hoped for       I think
Charlie had a vague idea that some day
Uncle Gerald might see me, and that       with
me being so like mamma       it might
do some good. But we hadn't fixed anything,
we meant to talk it all over the next
time he came       to-day, that is. He little
thought he would find it all done when
he came."

"Won't he be surprised!" I said.

"Mamma sent him a telegram this morning,"
she said. "He deserved it."

But by this time we were at the
Rectory.

We couldn't help feeling rather shy; we
had really never been out anywhere before
except once, in London, when we had gone
to have tea with a niece of nurse's, who
had a shop in one of the big streets, and we
had tea in the parlour behind. So that was
quite different, of course. At the Rectory
it was very nice except for our being shy.
But after luncheon, when we went out into
the garden with auntie, she soon sent away
the shyness. She was just as kind and
understanding as she could be, as she has
been ever since       such a perfect auntie that
our only wonder now is how we ever did
without her all those years.

We had to tell her all our story over
again, all from the beginning of grandpapa's
telling us we were to come to Rosebuds,
and the book with the name scored through;
we had to tell her, though we were afraid
of making her cry, down to our finding the
key and getting into the house, and the old
princess, and the new princess, and all.
She asked us questions, too, about Ansdell
Friars, and in what ways it was changed
since she had seen it.

"I should like to see it again," she said;
"though it would never seem as much
home to me as here," and she sighed a little.

"But you're not going away from here
now, auntie," we said, "You're not going
to sell the Old House?"

Auntie smiled.

"I hope not," she said. "They all think
I am in no way bound to Jackman. Indeed,
it was his haggling so about the price that
brought me down here this summer. But
one thing I have already given orders for:
those horrid pools are to be filled up at
once. I won't have dear Gerald's peace of
mind disturbed by any anxiety I can do
away with."

We stared       it wasn't for a minute or two
that we understood whom she was talking
of. It was so funny to hear grandpapa
spoken of as "Gerald"       and when we found
out whom she meant, we all burst out
laughing. And while we were still laughing
we heard wheels, and there was Mr.
Truro, who had looked in for a moment on
his way from the station. I don't think I
ever saw any one's face look so happy and
pleased as his did!

We all went back together to Rosebuds.
Auntie and Regina said they were going to
have afternoon tea with grandpapa, and you
don't know how nice it looked, all neatly put
out in the pretty old drawing-room, and
poor auntie kept giving little cries of mixed
pleasure and pain as she recognised one old
friend after another among the china and
the silver, and even the cakes, which were a
secret of Mrs. Munt's that no one could make
but herself.

And after tea we had a great treat.
Auntie persuaded grandpapa that the air
would do him good, and so she coaxed him
out into the garden and then down the lane,
and so on into the Old House grounds.
And then she and Regina took us all over
it       "It is best to get over the first seeing
it again at once," I heard auntie whisper to
grandpapa, "and the children's pleasure will
make it seem different."

It is such a beautiful old house. I could
write almost another book about it, and it
was so strange to get into the big drawing-room
by the double doors through which
Regina used to disappear, to see our old
princess smiling down at us in our happiness
just exactly as she had done in our trouble!

Poor old, ever young princess! We shall
always love you, but nothing, nothing like
our own dear bright living fairy who has
brought such new joy and good into our
lives. We have seldom been parted from
her and her mother since that day; we are
almost always together, grandpapa and
auntie and Regina and we children, and
very often Mr. Truro too. Grandpapa says
he is getting very old, but he really doesn't
look so, and even when he does get "very
old," we shall all only love him the better.
      

THE END.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
