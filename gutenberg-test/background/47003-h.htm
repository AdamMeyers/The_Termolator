CHAPTER I
</h3>

<h4>
WHICH INTRODUCES DIMBIE
</h4>

<p>
Outside, the world is bathed in sunshine,
beautiful, warm, life-giving spring sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Other worlds than mine may be shivering in a
March wind, but my own little corner is simply
basking.
</p>

<p>
The chestnut in the frog-pond field at the bottom
of the garden is holding forth eager arms, crowned
with little sticky, swelling buds, to the white, warm
light.  The snowdrops and crocuses have raised their
pretty faces for a caress, and a chaffinch perched in
the apple tree is, in its customary persistent fashion,
endeavouring to outsing a thrush who keeps
informing his lady-love that she may be clever enough
to lay four speckled eggs, but her voice, well&mdash;without
wishing to be too personal&mdash;would bear
about the same relation to his as the croak of those
silly frogs in the field would bear to the note of his
esteemed friend Mr. Nightingale, who was still
wintering in the south.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there is sunshine out of doors and sunshine
in my heart.  So much sunshine, that in my
exuberance I have only just refrained from embracing
Amelia, in spite of her down-at-heel, squeaky shoes,
rakish cap, and one-and-three-ha'penny pearl necklace.
</p>

<p>
You will surmise I have had a fortune left me
by my great-uncle.  I don't possess a great-uncle.
That I have been the recipient of a new Paris hat.
Wrong.  That someone has said I am the prettiest
girl in the county.  Bosh!  That Peter has ceased
to bully mother.  That will happen when the
millennium arrives.
</p>

<p>
Oh, foolish conjecturer!  You will never guess.
It is something far more delightful than any of these
things.  I will whisper it to you.  "Dimbie is
coming home this evening."  You smile while I
ecstatically hug Jumbles.  "Dimbie's a dog?" you
hazard.  "A white, pink-eyed, objectionable
Maltese terrier."  I chuckle at your being so very
wrong.  You are not brilliant; in fact, you are stupid.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie's a husband.  <i>My</i> husband.  And he's
been away for three days at the bedside of his sick
Aunt Letitia, who lives in Yorkshire.  I think it is
most unreasonable for any aunt to live in Yorkshire
and be ill when we live in Surrey.  It is so far away.
Anyhow, Dimbie shall never go away again to Aunt
Letitia, sick or well, without taking me with him.
For I find I cannot get on at all without him.
When I turn a retrospective eye upon the years
without Dimbie, it seems to me that I did not know
the meaning of the word happiness.
</p>

<p>
I was foolish enough to say this to Peter just
before I was married, and he sniffed in the
objectionable way which mother and I have always so
specially disliked.  It sounds undutiful to speak of
father thus, but he does sniff.  And I might as well
remark in passing that I am very far from being
attached to Peter, as I always call him behind his
back, being less like a father than anyone I have
ever met.  I am sorry that this should be so, but
I didn't choose him for a parent.  Parents have a
say in their children's existence, but you can't select
your own progenitors.  Were this within your
power, General Peter Macintosh and I would only
be on distant bowing terms at the moment, certainly
not parent and child.  And yet mother would be
lonely without me, although I have left her.  Poor,
darling mother!  That is my one trouble, the fly in
the ointment; her loneliness, her defencelessness.
</p>

<p>
I do not mean that Peter kicks her with clogs, or
throws lamps at her head.  But he worries her, nags
at her.
</p>

<p>
Now Dimbie never nags.  I think it was his utter
unlikeness to Peter that first attracted me.  Peter
is small and narrow in his views; Dimbie is large
in every sense of the word.  Peter has green eyes;
Dimbie has blue.  Peter has a straight, chiselled
nose&mdash;the Macintosh nose he calls it: Dimbie has a
dear crooked one&mdash;an accident at football.  Peter
has&mdash;&mdash;  But I think I'll just keep to Dimbie's
"points" without referring to General Macintosh
any further&mdash;well, because Dimbie is incomparable.
</p>

<p>
I met him first in an oil-shop in Dorking.  I was
ordering some varnish for one of Peter's canoes.
Since Peter "retired," which, unfortunately for
mother and me, was many years ago&mdash;he having
married late in life&mdash;he has spent his spare time in
a workshop at the bottom of the garden building
canoes which, up to the present, he has never
succeeded in getting to float.  But that is a mere
detail.  No one has ever expressed a wish to float
in them, so what matters?  The point is that this
arduous work kept him shut up in his workshop for
many hours away from mother and me.  It was
then we breathed and played and laughed, and
Miss Fairbrother, my governess, read us entrancing
stories and taught me how to slide down the
staircase on a tea-tray and do other delightful things,
while mother kept a sharp look-out for the advance
of the enemy.

<br />
PETER HAS SPENT HIS SPARE TIME BUILDING CANOES
</p>

<p>
Well, Dimbie and I got to know each other in
this little oil-shop.  I, or my muslin frock, became
entangled in some wire-netting, which really had no
business to be anywhere but at an ironmonger's, and
Dimbie disentangled me, there being no one else
present to perform this kindly act, the shopman
being up aloft searching for his best copal varnish.
</p>

<p>
We were not engaged till quite six weeks had
elapsed after this, because Peter would not sanction
such a proceeding.  He said I must behave as a
general's daughter, and not as a tradesman's; and
when I pointed out that royalties frequently became
engaged after seeing each other about half a dozen
times, and that publicly, he just shouted at me.
For years mother and I have been trying to
persuade Peter that we are not soldiers, but he doesn't
appear to believe us.  He only gave his consent in
the end to our engagement because he was tired
and gouty and wanted to be let alone.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie was like the importunate widow, and he
importuned in season and out of season, from break
of day till set of sun.  He neglected his business,
took rooms in Dorking, would fly up to the city for
a couple of hours each day, and spent the rest of
his time on our doorstep when he wasn't allowed
inside the house.  Peter tried threats, bribery,
shouting, drill language of the most fearful
description; but Dimbie stuck manfully to his guns, and
at last Peter was bound to admit that Dimbie must
have come of some good fighting stock.  Dimbie
admitted most cheerfully that he had, that his
great-great-grandfather had stormed the heights of
Abraham and Wolfe.  At which Peter laid down
his arms and briefly said, "Take her!"  And
Dimbie did so at the very earliest opportunity,
which was during the Christmas holidays.  And
so I am his greatly-loving and much-loved wife.
</p>

<p>
Much loved I know I am by the very way he
looks at me, strokes my hair, whispers my name,
stares angrily at Amelia when upon some pretext
she lingers in the room after bringing in coffee and
won't leave us alone.
</p>

<p>
Ah, that being alone!  How delightful it is.  We
have enjoyed that best of all.  We had so few
opportunities before we were married, Peter
appearing to think it was our duty to play whist each
evening, with most cheerful countenances; and were
I, out of sheer desperation, to trump his best card,
he would scream with annoyance.
</p>

<p>
But I'm not getting on with Dimbie's points.  I
think his dearest friend, or even his wife or mother,
would be over-stepping the strict boundary-line of
truth were they to describe him as handsome.  He's
not handsome.  For which Nanty, mother's old
schoolfellow, says I should be deeply grateful.
Handsome men, she tells me, have no time to
admire their own wives, so taken up are they with
their own graces, which is a pity for the wives.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the crooked nose I mentioned
Dimbie has also a crooked mouth, giving him the
most humorous, comical, and at the same time the
most kindly expression.  I wouldn't have Dimbie's
mouth straight for the world.  It droops at the left
corner.  He opines that he was born that way, that
it must be a family mouth, at which his mother is
extremely indignant.  She asserts that the mouths
in her family at any rate were quite perfect, and that
this droop is the result of a horrid pipe which was
never out of the corner of his mouth, alight or dead,
throughout his college days.  Dimbie laughs at this,
and says shall he grow a moustache to cover up the
defect, and I say No, he shan't.
</p>

<p>
The crook of his mouth and nose happen to be in
opposite directions, so even when he's depressed he
looks quite happy and amused.
</p>

<p>
Nature, trying to balance things up a little, then
gave him jolly, blue, twinkling eyes, and crisp brown
hair with little kinks in it.
</p>

<p>
He will be thirty-one on the second of next month.
His mother, whom I have only once seen and that
was at our wedding, doesn't approve of his telling
his age to any casual inquirer in his usual direct
manner, for it naturally gives her own age away.
Mrs. Westover, Nanty says, imagines she would pass
for under forty when the wind is in the west.
</p>

<p>
"Why west?" mother and I had cried together.
</p>

<p>
"A soft damp west wind will make a woman look
ten years younger," said Nanty sagely.  "It is a
north wind which works such havoc with her
complexion."
</p>

<p>
Mother and I have learnt a great deal from Nanty
one way or another, and the funny part of it is
that the information which doesn't matter always
seems to stick in my memory, while important things
go, which Dimbie says is the way of the world.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie is "on" the Stock Exchange.  Peter calls
it a sink of iniquity and its denizens liars and thieves.
One of the liars and thieves married me on the
strength of a good deal in Rio Tintos.  Rio Tintos
must be beautiful things to have been the means of
giving us so much happiness.  Dimbie says they are
not, that they are just plain copper mines in Spain.
Dimbie is mistaken.  Copper is one of the most
beautiful of metals with its red-gold, warm colour.  It is
the most romantic of metals.  A tin mine in Cornwall
would never have done for us what Rio Tintos have
done, I feel convinced.  The dictionary says copper
was perhaps the first metal employed by man,
which makes it doubly interesting to me.  Each
day I scan the financial column of the paper to see
if Rio Tintos are up or down.  Dimbie says he has
no interest in them now, and smiles at my eagerness,
but it makes no difference.  The words stand to
me for happiness, and I shall search for them always.

CHAPTER II
</h3>

<h4>
NANTY DISCOURSES ON THE WRITING OF BOOKS
</h4>

<p>
When I casually mentioned to Nanty&mdash;yesterday
afternoon over our tea&mdash;that I
had begun to write a book I was unprepared for her
opposition, which almost amounted to a command
that I should do nothing of the kind.  But then she
misunderstood me from the very beginning, which
was only natural now I come to reflect upon it,
added to which she has a disconcerting habit of
jumping to conclusions.
</p>

<p>
At the outset of our conversation her manner was
depressed as she looked into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well," she said at length, "it can't be helped!
I suppose you mean a first-person, diary, daily-round
sort of book?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded, pleased at her acumen.
</p>

<p>
"It is the worst and most tiresome kind, but
perhaps it will be best for your poor husband."
</p>

<p>
"My poor husband!" I echoed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Will you kindly explain?"
</p>

<p>
"It will be difficult, but I'll try."
</p>

<p>
She settled herself in her chair more comfortably.
</p>

<p>
"It appears to me that women, dear Marguerite,
write books from several motives, the principal being
that, unknown to herself, a woman will get rid in this
way of her own self-consciousness.  It is hard on the
public; it is a blessing in disguise to her friends."
</p>

<p>
"Nanty!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't say you are of that sort.  Why, I believe
the child's eyes are actually full of tears!" she added
in consternation.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," I said.
</p>

<p>
"But you're going to be hurt."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will add at once that I should not expect
to find in the pages of your book as much
self-consciousness as is customary in a young girl of your
years.  General Macintosh is not a person to
encourage illusions about oneself.  To live with him
must be an education, painful but liberal."
</p>

<p>
I smiled faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Some women write books because they are
lonely.  An absorbing occupation, even if badly
performed, helps to pass the time, and they yearn to
see themselves in print.  In fact, all writers yearn
to see themselves in print&mdash;a most natural desire
on their part, but one to be discouraged in this age
of over-publication.  Other women write because
they say they '<i>love</i> it.'  I am not sure that this type
isn't the worst of the lot.  They imagine because
they love it that they must necessarily do it well.
Not at all, the deduction is a poor one.  I love
bridge, but rarely pull off a 'no trumper.'
</p>

<p>
"And a few, a <i>very</i> few, write because they have
really something to say, something to tell.
Something new&mdash;no, not new, there is nothing new
under the sun, but a fresh way of telling an old story.
A burning force, something stronger than themselves,
which is another name for genius, compels them to
speak, to give their message, and the world is the
gainer.  Now why do you want to write?  Which
of these four impulses is yours?"
</p>

<p>
She rose and drew on her gloves.
</p>

<p>
"A burning force stronger than myself, which is
another name for genius."
</p>

<p>
She laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You're not offended with me?" she asked as
I conducted her to the gate.
</p>

<p>
"Just a teeny bit, Nanty."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you mustn't be."
</p>

<p>
She took my two hands in both of hers.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't dream of permitting you to sulk with
me, little Marguerite.  I've known you since the
days when you wore a pinafore and had to be slapped
for washing some snails in the best toilet ware in
my spare room before throwing them to the ducks&mdash;nasty
child.  It seems hard to discourage you, to
talk to you thus, but whatever in the name of fortune
has put such a dreadful idea into your head?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think it so dreadful?"
</p>

<p>
"Terribly dreadful!" she returned.  "I knew an
authoress&mdash;I beg her pardon, I mean an author&mdash;who
after a small success with her first book&mdash;nasty,
miry sort of book it was too&mdash;left her husband, quite
a decent man as men go, with red hair and freckles
(they lived in the country), and went to London to
see life as she called it, which meant sitting on the
top of a penny omnibus and eating rolls and butter
at an A.B.C.  She wore her hair <i>à la</i> Sarah
Bernhardt, and expected to have an intrigue, which
never came off, the lady being past forty and plain
at that.  When her second edition money&mdash;I think
it got into a second edition&mdash;was finished she was
very glad and thankful to creep back to her husband,
who in a big, magnanimous way took her in, which
I wouldn't have done.  Then I knew another
author&mdash;successful fifth edition this was&mdash;whose head
became so swelled that some cows in a field&mdash;she
was lying in a ditch composing&mdash;took it for a
mangel-wurzel one day and ate it."
</p>

<p>
"Do you expect me to laugh here?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," she reassured me.  "I only want to
impress you before it is too late.  I have one more
case.  A poor girl wrote a book called <i>Awakenings</i>,
or some such title.  A reviewer on an ultra-superior,
provincial paper, the <i>Damchester Guardian</i> I think it
was, cut it to pieces with the cleverness, cruelty and
ruthlessness of extreme youth.  The critic must have
been young, for only youth is really hard.  There
was not a good word for it; it was described as
maudlin, sentimental twaddle.  The girl&mdash;she was
a fool of course, but we can't all be born
clever&mdash;committed suicide.  This was a bit of rare good
luck for her publisher, for he got an advertisement
for nothing, and sold forty thousand copies of the
book in three months."
</p>

<p>
Nanty paused for breath.  John, the coachman,
looked respectfully ahead and pretended he didn't
mind waiting; and I called her attention to our
bank of crocuses.
</p>

<p>
"Don't like crocuses," she said.
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Still obstinate?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I replied, "I gave up my book over my
second cup of tea."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Marguerite," she said, kissing me.  "I am
sure you will make your husband very happy."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so."
</p>

<p>
"You're bound to, if you are as earnest as all
that about it.  Your face looks like&mdash;like&mdash;a
toadstool!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to say pretty things to you.  You
get quite enough from that silly Dimbie of yours.
But now tell me before I go, just to satisfy my
curiosity, what is your reason for wishing to write this
book?  I always thought you such a simple child."
</p>

<p>
I closed the carriage door and looked away.
</p>

<p>
She leaned forward and turned my face round.
</p>

<p>
"Why, she's actually blushing!" she ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
"Home," I said to John, wresting my face away.
</p>

<p>
"But it's not home," she contradicted, "and
won't be home till you tell me why you are blushing
like a peony."
</p>

<p>
"Nanty," I cried, "you are too bad."
</p>

<p>
"Marguerite, why are you looking so guilty and
ashamed?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not," I said stoutly.
</p>

<p>
"You are."
</p>

<p>
"Why should I look ashamed?"
</p>

<p>
"That's what I want to get at.  I ask you the
simplest question, upon which your countenance
becomes that of a criminal run to earth."
</p>

<p>
"Pictorial exaggeration," I said lightly.  "And,
Nanty, I'm catching cold.  Remember it is only
March."
</p>

<p>
"Take this rug," she replied coolly.  "I shall not
let you go till you give me your reason for wishing
to appear in print."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't," I said with heat.
</p>

<p>
"You said you did."
</p>

<p>
"Never.  You imagined that.  I simply said I
was writing a book&mdash;a daily-round sort of journal,
as you described it.  I never referred to publication."
</p>

<p>
Nanty turned up her veil and stared at me for
some seconds.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, well!" she said at length.  "I
wonder you didn't say so sooner."
</p>

<p>
"You never gave me an opportunity.  At my first
words you were off at a tangent, and then I became
interested in your awful experiences."
</p>

<p>
She sat back and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"The impudence of the child drawing me like
this.  If you don't want your books published write
fifty of them.  It will keep you well out of mischief
and do nobody any harm."
</p>

<p>
Then she fell into a brown study, and I prepared
to tiptoe softly through the gate, when she cried
suddenly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Wait!  You have still not told me why you
are doing this scribbling.  I should have thought
you would have found plenty to do without writing.
There is your house&mdash;your sewing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You will laugh."
</p>

<p>
"I won't."
</p>

<p>
"Promise."
</p>

<p>
"I promise."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I began, "I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Nanty was looking at the sunset.
</p>

<p>
"I want to write, I must write," I went on more
firmly, "because I am so&mdash;happy.  It sounds silly,
ridiculous, I know, and you won't understand,
but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I paused.  Nanty was still looking at the sunset.
"You see, I was never very happy before I was
married because of Peter&mdash;father, I mean.  You
have visited us often, so you know.  You know
how he worries poor mother.  It was impossible to
be happy.  But now it is all so different, so
wonderful, so tranquil, that I sometimes feel almost
sick with happiness.  It is too good to last, it cannot
last.  I am sometimes frightened.  And I cannot
let Dimbie know how I feel.  Once you told me
not to let the man I loved be too sure of it.  The
moment in which a man knows he has gained your
love he ceases to value it."
</p>

<p>
"Did I say that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you said that to me the day I was married.
So what am I to do?  I can't tell Amelia; I can't
write it to mother, for Peter would sneer.  I must
have an outlet for my feelings, or they will overwhelm
me.  When I have sung and danced and rushed
round the garden after Jumbles I can fly to my
book.  I can enter, 'Dimbie is a dear,' 'Dimbie is
<i>my</i> husband, and he will be home in half an hour.'  'One
Tree Cottage is the sweetest spot on earth, and
I, Marguerite Westover, am the happiest girl in the
world.'  When the last half hour before his
homecoming hangs heavily I can enter all the events of
the day.  It will pass the time.  In the years to
come, when I am an old, old woman, I can turn
back the pages and read again of my first wonderful
year.  It will be a book only for myself, only for
my eyes.  That which Dimbie could not understand
I can put between its covers.  A man, I imagine,
cannot always understand the way a woman feels
about things that touch her deeply, like&mdash;well, like
when Dimbie and I say our prayers together.  And
the song of a bird, a thrush woke us the other
morning.  It was perched on a bough in a shaft of
warm sunlight, and was pouring out its little heart
just as though it were breaking with happiness.  My
eyes were full of tears, and Dimbie saw them.  He
said&mdash;well, he didn't understand.  He thought I
was sad, and I couldn't explain even to him that my
tears were of joy.  And Amelia&mdash;she looks at me
so when six o'clock comes and I cannot keep my feet
still.  I brush up the hearth and put Dimbie's
slippers to warm, and cut the magazines, and place
our two chairs side by side, very close together, and
put a daffodil in my hair, and go to the window,
and wander to the kitchen, and go to the front
door, and back to the kitchen to see how the meat
is doing, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I broke off, for Nanty had held up her hands for
me to cease, and when she turned to me her eyes
were full of tears.
</p>

<p>
"Write your book, Marguerite," she whispered.
"Write your book."  Then she stooped and kissed
me, and then she gave a laugh, but there was a
little sob in it.
</p>

<p>
I looked at her wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"You say I told you to hide your love from the
man you have married.  I take the words back.
Better too much love than too little between husband
and wife, for theirs is a union dependent on much
affection and sacrifice if they would be happy.  And
God forbid that sorrow, disillusionment shall ever
enter into your life.  God forbid that you shall ever
be lonely, stretch out a hand at night and find
emptiness, pour out your troubles and find a deaf
ear turned to you, offer a caress which is met with
a curse."
</p>

<p>
Her voice was so low I could hardly catch the
bitterness of her words.
</p>

<p>
"But can such things ever be?" I cried.
</p>

<p>
She laughed a little dry laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I have known of them.  It would seem that
some marriages were not made in heaven."
</p>

<p>
I thought of Peter and mother.  Had Nanty's
marriage been unhappy too?  She had been alone
ever since I could remember.  The mistress of a
handsome house, lovely garden...
</p>

<p>
Nanty broke in&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And when you write your book, don't let it all
be of Dimbie.  Some women haven't got a Dimbie,
and women are the principal readers of women's
books.  Enter as well all the little worries and cares
which are bound to crop up sooner or later, so that
the contrast between your life and the life of some
lonely, unloved woman may not be too cruel.  She
will laugh at Amelia's smashing the best china,
enjoy your misfortunes, cheer up when Dimbie is
down with typhoid and not expected to live."
</p>

<p>
"But you forget my book will only be for myself.
I don't know enough to write one for other people.
Dimbie says I am very ignorant."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course!  And that after all is the best
sort of book, the one you write for yourself.  Some
publisher will be saved endless care and worry.
Your friends will be saved the necessity of turning
down side streets when they see you coming along&mdash;they
have barely four-and-six for one of the classics,
or a book they really want, let alone yours."
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You are not polite."
</p>

<p>
"No, Marguerite; I love you, and I want to save
you from your friends.  But perhaps some day
when it is finished, when your year is over, when
you are too busy, like so many modern girls, to do
anything but play golf and bridge, or there may be
another interest in your life, you might let me have
a look at it.  A manuscript written out of sheer
happiness might be interesting, though a trifle
tiresome.  There has been <i>The Sorrows of Werther</i>.
Why not <i>The Joys of Marguerite</i>?  Besides, your
grammar and punctuation might require some
correction."
</p>

<p>
"Nanty," I said, "you are making fun of me, and
I'm very cold."
</p>

<p>
"Marguerite," she commanded, "give me another
kiss, and then I'll go.  I have enjoyed my afternoon
with the little bride."
</p>

<p>
"I hear the whistle of Dimbie's train."
</p>

<p>
"What an astonishing thing!" she remarked
sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
"I mean, won't you stay and see him?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't.  I'm going home."
</p>

<p>
"John must have been interested in our conversation."
</p>

<p>
"John grows deafer each day," she said as she
drove away.
</p>

<p>
I wandered down the lane to meet Dimbie, and
presently he turned the corner.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<h4>
ON AMELIA, FLUES, AND DRAIN-BAMBOOS
</h4>

<p>
"Put down your worries," said Nanty, so I must
perforce enter Amelia and the kitchen boiler.
The boiler won't yield hot water, and Amelia says
that isn't her fault, that she wasn't the plumber
who put it there, and she can't be expected to get a
flue-brush into a hole the size of a threepenny-bit.
</p>

<p>
When I said I thought she put it up the chimney
she asked me what for.
</p>

<p>
"To clean the flue, of course," I retorted, a little
irritably; and she replied with fine scorn that flues
didn't grow up chimneys, but at the backs of
fire-grates and other un-get-at-able places.
</p>

<p>
Ever since Amelia came to us her object appears
to have been the sounding the depths of my
ignorance, with the idea of putting us in our proper
positions.  I don't mean that she wishes to be the
mistress exactly, and sit with Dimbie in the
drawing-room while I peel potatoes in the back kitchen; but
she wishes me to understand that she knows I am a
silly sort of creature, and she will do the best she
can for me, seeing that she is one of the
"old-fashioned sort" who still take a kindly and
benevolent interest in their master and mistress.
</p>

<p>
Not that Amelia is old-fashioned really, with flat
caps and elastic-sided cloth boots, such as mother's
servants wear.  She is an entirely modern product.
She knows how to do the cake-walk, and wears
two-strapped patent slippers, with high Louis heels
which turn over at a most dangerous angle, looking
more like two leaning towers of Pisa than decorous,
respectable "general's" heels.  But she is
old-fashioned in the sense that she appears to have
our interests most tremendously at heart, is quite
painfully economical, is forever scrubbing and
cleaning, and calls me "mum" instead of "madam"
when she isn't calling me "miss."
</p>

<p>
Just now she invited me to go and see how far
she had got the brush up the flue.  She was hurt
because Dimbie had said <i>he</i> should have to get up
early and see what he could do about the hot water.
In fact, she had laughed derisively behind the
roller-towel.  She thinks no more of Dimbie's
capabilities than of mine.
</p>

<p>
I went, and was much impressed by the length of
the flue-brush and its pliability.  Amelia had raked
out the fire, and, with sleeves rolled back, showed
me what she could do with flues.  It was like being
at a conjuring entertainment.  The brush flashed
about like lightning, got into impossible places,
curved, wriggled, and once I thought that Amelia
herself was about to disappear up the chimney.  I
clutched at her legs and brought her down.  Her
face was glowing and black in places.
</p>

<p>
"Now, mum," she panted, "if there's no hot
water, is it my fault?  If Amelia Cockles can't get
no hot water, no livin' mortal can, includin' the
master hisself.  I'll show him to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't, Amelia!  Don't do it again!  It's
so difficult and dangerous, you might get stuck," I
pleaded.  "We'll have a new boiler."
</p>

<p>
"It's not the boiler," she pronounced; "it's
where it's been put."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll have it moved.  Where would you
like it?"
</p>

<p>
She was guarded in her answer.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure as you can move boilers about like
furniture.  We must think it over."
</p>

<p>
She drew the brush from the flue, and I now saw
it in its entire length.
</p>

<p>
"Wherever did you get it from?"  I knew Dimbie
and I hadn't bought it when we furnished.
</p>

<p>
"From the ironmonger's, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Was it expensive?" I asked carelessly.  I
wondered if it were a present from Amelia to us.
</p>

<p>
"Sixpence ha'penny.  I sold some bottles and
rubbish to the donkey-stone man."
</p>

<p>
"All that for sixpence halfpenny?" I ejaculated,
ignoring the donkey-stone man, of whom I had
never heard before.
</p>

<p>
Amelia eyed me a little pityingly.
</p>

<p>
"Would you care to see the drain-bamboo, mum?
<i>That cost fourpence.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"The drain-bamboo?"
</p>

<p>
"The thing we push down the drains to keep 'em
clean and save bad smells."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, please."
</p>

<p>
Amelia produced it.  It was tied up in coils, and
as she cut the string it shot across the kitchen floor
and narrowly escaped my ankles.  I didn't like the
drain-bamboo at all, it was a nasty, sinuous thing,
and I asked Amelia to remove it at once.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any further contrivances, I mean
unusual ones, concealed about the premises?" I
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Them are not unusual.  I can't think where
you was brought up if you haven't seen a
flue-brush before, mum."
</p>

<p>
"I was born in Westmoreland first and then
Dorking."
</p>

<p>
Amelia looked at me.
</p>

<p>
"I mean I was born in Westmoreland and then
removed to Dorking."  Amelia flurries me so at
times I hardly know what I am saying.  "I never
went into the kitchen much," I added apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"P'r'aps your ma helped the general?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, we hadn't a general."
</p>

<p>
"No servant?" in great astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"We had a servant, but not a general."
</p>

<p>
"A help?"
</p>

<p>
"No, we'd four servants.  You see, my father
suffers from gout, and he requires a lot&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Cook, kitchen-maid, housemaid, parlour-maid?"
interrupted Amelia, ignoring my explanation.
</p>

<p>
"That was it."
</p>

<p>
Amelia put some coal on the fire, which she had
relit, with a considerable amount of noise.
</p>

<p>
"No wonder you're hignorant, mum."
</p>

<p>
Amelia never leaves an "h" out, but in moments
of stress occasionally puts one in.  On the whole
she speaks well for a Cockney born, and educated
in the Mile End Road.  Of course all her "a's"
are "i's," but I find it difficult to transcribe them.
"I tell Dimbie I know I shall pick up the vernacular
as I am peculiarly imitative; and he says he hopes
I won't, as it is not pretty."
</p>

<p>
"Beggin' your pardon for sayin' such a thing,
but it's evidently not your fault, and p'r'aps
you'll improve as time goes on.  You've time to
learn."
</p>

<p>
I tried to feel cheered at the hopes Amelia held
out to me, and prepared to leave the kitchen, feeling
a little annoyed with mother for neglecting my
education so far as flue-brushes and drain-bamboos
were concerned.
</p>

<p>
"How old are you, mum?  You'll hexcuse me
askin' you."
</p>

<p>
I hesitated.  Were Amelia to know that I was
two years her senior would she despise me more
than ever?
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, mum.  No ladies likes to tell their
ages.  In my last place&mdash;Tompkinses'&mdash;the oldest
daughter, Miss Julia, used to begin a chatterin' to
the canary for all she was worth when anybody so
much as mentions how old they was, and the way
time was passin'.  New Year's Eve was the worst,
when the bells was tollin'.  I've known her wake
that poor canary up, when it had gone to bed, and
say, 'Dicky, Dicky, pretty Dick,' and it thought the
incandescent light was the sun, and had its bath
straight away."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm not so bad as that," I laughed, "I'm
twenty-three!"
</p>

<p>
Amelia blacked her face more than ever in her
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Bless my soul!  Who'd have thought it?  In
that white dress you wears at night you looks like
a bit of a thing who has just got out of pinifores.
Twenty-three!  You're older than me, and never
seed a flue-brush before."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you have always been brought up with
them?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"I could handle one at six, or my mother would
have let me know what for."
</p>

<p>
She swelled with pride at the retrospection of
her infant capabilities.
</p>

<p>
"You were evidently most clever.  Perhaps you
were born grown up.  Some people are."
</p>

<p>
She considered this.
</p>

<p>
"I was always smart for my years."
</p>

<p>
"And I wasn't.  I think I must have developed
slowly, Amelia.  When you were cleaning flues I
was nursing dolls.  Perhaps it was my parents'
fault.  I was the only child."
</p>

<p>
"And I'm the eldest of fourteen."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!" I said.  "And are they all expert
flue cleaners?"
</p>

<p>
"Eight of 'em is in heaven."
</p>

<p>
She sounded as sure of this point as the exasperating
little cottage girl.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better get on with your work; I'm
interrupting you," I said, as I walked to the door.
</p>

<p>
About every third day I make this remark to
Amelia with the faint hope of impressing upon her
that <i>I</i> am the mistress of the establishment.  Then
I carefully close the kitchen door behind me, barricade
myself in the dining- or drawing-room, and sit down
and think about her.  I am sure Amelia has not
the slightest idea of how her figure looms in my
mental horizon.  I don't want to think about her.
Dimbie or mother or Nanty are much pleasanter
subjects, but I can't help it; she is the sort of person
you <i>must</i> think about.
</p>

<p>
Nanty found her for me.
</p>

<p>
She said, "You and Dimbie will require someone
extremely capable.  Amelia Cockles exactly answers
to this description."
</p>

<p>
Now what worries me is whether to sit down
quietly and let Amelia manage us and be happy, or
whether to endeavour to uphold our dignity and be
uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
Were I to put such a question to Dimbie he
would say, "Let's be happy."  But this happiness is
qualified when she gives us roly-poly pudding more
than once every ten days.  It is a pudding for which
I have always had a peculiar dislike.  I will order, I
mean suggest, that we shall have a thatched house
pudding for dinner.  I mention my liking for brown
thatch, not straw-coloured thatch.  I sit with an
expectant appetite, and a roly-poly appears, white,
flabby, and bursting at its ends with raspberry jam.
Reproachfully I look at Amelia, but her return gaze
is as innocent and ingenuous as a little child's.  She
would have me believe that I never even so much as
mentioned a thatched house pudding.  Dimbie sends
up his plate for a second helping.  While Amelia
goes for the cheese course I say, "Do you think you
could like roly-poly a little less, only a <i>little</i>
less?"  And Dimbie, passing up his plate for a third helping,
says he will try, but it will be difficult, as Amelia
makes such ripping ones, and of course she enters
the room at the moment and hears him.  She hears
everything.  I think she must fly between the
kitchen and dining-room when she waits at dinner,
or have spring boots concealed beneath the hall table.
</p>

<p>
I happened to mention the roly-poly to Nanty,
and she said, "Be thankful she can make a pudding
at all, or you might have to make it yourself."  There
was an assumption in her manner that I
couldn't, and I didn't argue the point.  It is useless
arguing with Nanty.
</p>

<p>
There is another point in Amelia's disfavour to
put against her admitted capability&mdash;she squeaks.
Her shoes squeak and her corsets creak, and her
breathing is conducted in a series of gasps&mdash;long
ones when she sweeps a room, short ones when she
hands the potatoes at dinner.  She seems to want
oiling at every point of vantage, like a bicycle.
Sometimes I lie awake at night and discuss or try
to discuss with Dimbie the possibilities of stopping
the squeaking.
</p>

<p>
"Tell her to wear cloth boots like your mother."
</p>

<p>
"Mother doesn't wear cloth boots," I contradict.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you said she did," he murmurs sleepily.
</p>

<p>
"No, our servants wear them."
</p>

<p>
"Well, tell Amelia to do the same."
</p>

<p>
"She won't."
</p>

<p>
"Then I give it up."
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie," I say coaxingly, "before you go quite,
quite off, couldn't you suggest a remedy for
squeaking?  Oil would spoil the carpets."
</p>

<p>
"Fill 'em with corn," comes the amazing suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"You put corn in wet shoes, dear donkey," I
shout, trying to clutch him back from that beautiful
land of oblivion to which all of us, happy or
unhappy, healthy or sick, young or old, are so glad to
go, when like little children we are just tired.  But
he had gone.  Nothing short of a thunderbolt would
bring him back till the morrow.
</p>

<p>
And when that morrow came I suggested to
Amelia that she should dip the shoes into water.
</p>

<p>
"Why not boil 'em, mum, with a little washing powder?"
</p>

<p>
Her face was stolid, but there was a hint of irony
in her voice.  With dignity I walked from the
kitchen, barricaded myself, and once again sat down
to think about her.  The squeaking was unendurable;
the creaking of the corsets was nearly as bad.
For these two things I could not give her notice;
besides, I should never dare to give anybody notice.
</p>

<p>
A little later on I caught her in the hall in an old
pair of wool-work slippers embroidered with
tea-roses which had belonged to Dimbie, but which I
had surreptitiously banished to the boxroom.  She
was in the midst of a cake-walk; her chest was
stuck out like a pouter pigeon's, and one tea-rose
was poised high in the air.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Amelia!</i>" I shouted, scandalised, "what are
you dreaming of?  Have you taken leave of your
senses?"
</p>

<p>
She brought the tea-rose to earth with a bang,
and stood like a soldier at attention.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, mum.  Didn't know you was there,
or I wouldn't have done it.  But I was so happy at
thinkin' how pleased you would be in seein' me in
these here shoes, as you have took such a dislike to
the others."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not pleased," I rejoined.  "I could not
think of permit&mdash;of approving of your wearing
wool-work slippers for answering the front-door
bell."
</p>

<p>
"It never rings, mum."
</p>

<p>
"It will when callers begin to arrive; and when
you receive your next month's wages I shall be glad,
Amelia, if you will buy a pair of cloth flat-heeled
boots or shoes.  Kid are expensive, but cloth is
beautifully cheap."
</p>

<p>
"You mentioned them before, mum.  P'r'aps
you'll remember.  I never have and never could
wear black cloth shoes.  It would be like walkin'
about with a pair of funerals on your feet.  They'd
depress a nigger minstrel.  Anything else to meet
you.  White tennis shoes?  They're soft and don't
squeak."
</p>

<p>
"No, Amelia," I said wearily, "white tennis shoes
would be worse than the wool-work.  We'll dismiss
the subject.  It is said that a man can get
accustomed even to being hanged.  I may learn to like
your shoes in time, and even regard their noisiness
as music."
</p>

<p>
And I went back to the drawing-room and closed
the door.  The subject was finished, and so Amelia
continues to squeak.
</p>

CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<h4>
DIMBIE'S BIRTHDAY
</h4>

<p>
I find, in accordance with Nanty's advice, that
I kept Dimbie well out of the last chapter; but
he's bound to figure pretty largely in this, for he's
had a birthday.  A birthday cannot very well be
touched upon without referring to the person
interested, and Dimbie was extremely interested because
of the omelet Amelia made him for breakfast.
</p>

<p>
On the morning previous I said to Amelia&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow is the master's birthday.  Now what
shall we give him for breakfast?  It must be
something very nice."
</p>

<p>
"Pigs' feet."
</p>

<p>
"Pigs' feet?" I ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mum.  Pigs' feet boiled till juicy and
tender, and red cabbage."
</p>

<p>
"But it's for breakfast," I repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mum.  You mentioned that."
</p>

<p>
"But you can't eat pigs' feet for breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Tompkins' brother-in-law, Mr. München,
was dead nuts on it."
</p>

<p>
Her attitude was unshaken.
</p>

<p>
"But wasn't he German, Amelia?"
</p>

<p>
"P'r'aps he was," she admitted.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," I said triumphantly, "that makes all the
difference."
</p>

<p>
"What about brawn or sausages, or black puddings
or ham, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"You see they're all&mdash;pig," I said hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're not Jews, mum.  Tompkinses had
a friend who&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I want something novel," I cut in, leaving the
friend till another time.  "I want something we
have not had before."
</p>

<p>
She thought a moment.  Then her countenance
brightened.
</p>

<p>
"I know, mum, savoury duck."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be ridiculous," I commanded.  "We're
wasting time."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't a duck really, mum.  P'r'aps you thought
it was?"
</p>

<p>
"When you say a duck, I naturally think you
mean a duck."
</p>

<p>
I was getting tired.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't.  It's made of the insides of animals
mixed with onions.  You buy them at tripe-shops,
and they're real good."
</p>

<p>
I felt myself turning sick.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia," I said, trying to be patient, "will you
remember it's breakfast we are discussing.  I've
called your attention to the fact several times.  I
think it will have to end in an omelet&mdash;a nice,
light omelet.  Do you know how to make one?"
</p>

<p>
Now Amelia will never allow that she doesn't
know everything in the world, so her reply was
guarded.
</p>

<p>
"It's made of eggs."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," I rejoined.
</p>

<p>
"And milk and butter&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The milk might be right, but I wasn't so sure
about the butter.
</p>

<p>
Amelia pounced on my hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I believe you don't know how to make
one yourself, mum."
</p>

<p>
I was bound to confess that I didn't.
</p>

<p>
"My opportunities to cook have been few," I
explained.  "The little I know was learned at a
cookery class."
</p>

<p>
Amelia sniffed derisively.
</p>

<p>
"And a lot you'd learn there, mum&mdash;hentries
and hoary doves, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Hoary doves!" I repeated wonderingly, and
vaguely thinking of a very ancient white-haired
dove.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, them silly things rich folks begins their
dinners with&mdash;anchovies and holives."
</p>

<p>
"You mean <i>hors-d'oeuvres</i>?"  That I suppressed
a smile should go to my good account, I think.
</p>

<p>
"That's it, only my tongue won't twist round it
like yours."
</p>

<p>
"And where have you met them?" I inquired
with interest.
</p>

<p>
"At Tompkinses'!"
</p>

<p>
"And did they have them every night?"
</p>

<p>
"No, just at dinner parties."  She spoke in an
airy, careless fashion.
</p>

<p>
"I see," I said, greatly impressed.
</p>

<p>
Amelia had been accustomed to <i>hors-d'oeuvres</i> at
dinner parties, and yet she condescended to live
with us.
</p>

<p>
I looked with unusual interest at her closely-curled
fringe, her sharp, eager features, and her
shamrock brooch.  I listened to her squeaking;
it was the corsets this time.  Sometimes a bone
cracks in them like the report of a small pistol, and
I think to myself, "Well, there is one less to
break." But the number never seems to diminish.  I fancy
she must have a horde of bones, a sort of nest-egg
of bones, put by, and as soon as one cracks it is
promptly replaced by a sound one.  Occasionally
one bores through her print bodice, and then she
puts a patch on the place, a new print patch, which
rarely matches the rest of her dress.  I counted
four one day.  She will look like a patchwork quilt
soon, and I feel a little depressed at the prospect.
</p>

<p>
I roused myself with an effort to Dimbie's birthday
and the breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Amelia had produced the cookery book, and was
rapidly reading out loud various recipes for every
variety of omelet.
</p>

<p>
"Stop," I said, "I'm getting muddled."
</p>

<p>
It ended in our selecting a savoury parsley omelet.
</p>

<p>
"I hope it will be nice," I said anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it will be nice.  You leave it to me,
mum.  I've got a hand <i>that</i> light the master will
be wishin' he had a birthday every day of his life."
</p>

<p>
The birthday morning dawned clear and beautiful.
My first thought was of the omelet.  I rose
softly, dressed quickly, and went out into the garden
with the hope of finding a few flowers to put at the
side of Dimbie's plate.  A fresh, springy scent met
me everywhere&mdash;damp earth, moist trees, sun-kissed,
opening, baby leaves.  I inspected our apple
tree, which stands in the middle of the lawn, with
close attention.  It is the only tree we possess.  I
looked for a promise of blossom.  "Perhaps ... yes,
in a month's time," I said.  I wandered down
the garden to the fence which divides us from the
frog-pond field.  A garden set at the edge of a field
is a most cunning device, especially when the field
contains well-grown trees (which hang over the
fence, dipping and swaying and holding converse
of the friendliest description with your own denizens
of the garden) and a frog-pond into the bargain.
The croaking of frogs may not be musical, but it
may be welcomed as one of the surest notifications
of the advent of spring.  Mr. Frog is courting Miss
Frog.  He says, "Listen to my voice," on which he
emits a harsh, rasping sound, somewhat resembling
the note of the corncrake.  Miss Frog is probably
very impressed.  So are Dimbie and I.
</p>

<p>
"So countrified," says Dimbie, drawing a long,
deep breath of the sweet, pure air.
</p>

<p>
"So far from the madding crowd," say I.
"Who ever hears a frog near the big, noisy towns?"
</p>

<p>
By and by we shall see little black eggs, embedded
in a gelatinous substance, floating about the surface
of the water.  Later on there will be tadpoles, and
then more frogs.
</p>

<p>
The beech tree, I think, is the most kindly disposed
of all the brethren to us dwellers of the garden.
A lime nods to the apple tree, which is exactly in its
line of vision, but the beech leans and leans over the
fence, craning its neck, holding out long, beautiful
branches, which so soon will be decorated with a
delicate lace-work of the most exquisitely tender of
all the spring greens.  The beech is a long time in
unfolding her treasures&mdash;the sycamore and chestnut
can give her many days; but when she does
consent to open out her leaves, what a wealth of
beauty!
</p>

<p>
On this morning I thought I could almost see
them uncurling in the sunshine, hear them laughing
at their old friend the lime.  I could have dallied
with them, anxious to hear what they had to say,
what sort of a winter had been theirs, but Dimbie
and breakfast must be waiting for me.
</p>

<p>
I sped into the house, just in time to see Dimbie
removing the dish cover.  I paused in the doorway
to witness his smile of pleasure at finding an
omelet&mdash;a savoury parsley omelet&mdash;before him, but no
smile came.  In its place was a blank look of
inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" he returned.
</p>

<p>
"An omelet."  I walked quickly to the table.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is it?" he said quite politely.
</p>

<p>
We stood together and looked at the thing,
was very small and thin, and hard and spotty.
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was veal stuffing."  He was grave
and still quite courteous.
</p>

<p>
"It looks like a bit of old blanket," I observed.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't look wholesome, do you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it looks most unwholesome."  I put my
hand on the bell.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," he said, "Amelia might be hurt: let's
give it to Jumbles."
</p>

<p>
But Jumbles was a wise cat.  He smelt it, stood
up his hair on end, and walked away.  And so we
burnt it.
</p>

<p>
When I ordered some bacon to be cooked Amelia
asked me how we had enjoyed the omelet.
</p>

<p>
"It was a little small," I said evasively.
</p>

<p>
"Just a little small," said Dimbie cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"That must be the fault of the egg-powder, there
was no eggs in the house," she said as she bustled
out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie peeped at me and I peeped at Dimbie, and
we both broke into suppressed laughter.
</p>

<p>
"I always said she was the most resourceful girl
I had ever met."
</p>

<p>
"She is," I groaned; "and I thought it would be
such a beautiful surprise to you."
</p>

<p>
"It was, dearest," he assured me; "never was so
surprised at anything in my life."
</p>

<p>
I handed him my present and looked at him
anxiously.  Would this too be a disappointment?
He had talked of pipe-racks so frequently&mdash;of the
foolish construction of the ordinary rack, which,
supporting the bowl of the pipe at the top, naturally
encourages the evil-tasting nicotine to flow down
the stem.  This I had had made specially for him
of the most beautiful fumed oak.  The bowls of his
pipes could now rest sensibly, the stems pointing
skywards.  His pleasure was unfeigned.  He left
his breakfast to hang it up and kiss me.
</p>

<p>
"How clever you are, Marg," he said.  "How did
you know?"
</p>

<p>
"You have sometimes mentioned it."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I have derived a considerable amount of useful
information from you one way or another.  I may
even become capable in the end."
</p>

<p>
"There's no knowing," he agreed.
</p>

<p>
Then we fell to making our plans for the day.
It was not often that Dimbie took a holiday, we
must make the most of it.  We would cycle to some
pine woods at Oxshott which we knew well and
loved greatly.  We would lunch there by the side
of a little pool set in a hollow&mdash;Sleepy Hollow we
called it.  It would be warm there and sunny, for
the trees had withdrawn to the right and left, and it
was open to the sun and rain and wind of heaven.
When we had rested we would go to a dingle where
I knew primrose roots were to be found.  What
corner and nook and hidden by-way and bridle-path
in our beautiful Surrey were unknown to me?
I had flown to them from Peter.  I had spent long
days in the fields, on the commons, in the pine woods
away from Peter.  My bicycle was a friend in need.
Peter couldn't cycle.  Nothing short of a motor-car
could catch me on my bicycle.  Peter hadn't a
motor-car.  Motor-cars, bicycles, and truant girls
were an invention of the devil.  I would laugh in my
sleeve, while Peter swore.
</p>

<p>
I am introducing Dimbie to a lot of my old
haunts.  Two on their travels are better than one.
</p>

<p>
Amelia packed our lunch and asked when we
would be home.
</p>

<p>
"It is impossible to say," I told her.  "When one
rides away into the country or into a sunset or into
a moonrise one may never return."
</p>

<p>
And Amelia stared as she does sometimes when I
cannot keep the laughter and happiness out of my
voice.
</p>

<p>
"There's the steak," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Cook it when we come in," I called as I followed
Dimbie through the wooden gate&mdash;which is such
a joy to me, as it might have been iron&mdash;and down
the lane.
</p>

<p>
How glorious it was as we spun along the smooth,
red roads, and felt the sun and wind on our faces,
and breathed spring&mdash;for spring was everywhere!
</p>

<p>
"Go on in front, Marg," commanded Dimbie.
"I want to look at the sun on your hair.  It's like
pure gold."
</p>

<p>
I humoured his fancy.
</p>

<p>
"I want to feel it," he called, "to stroke it, it
looks quite hot.  Let's stop for a rest."
</p>

<p>
We dismounted, and sat down on a bank.
</p>

<p>
"You won't ruffle it?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied, "I'll be awfully careful."
</p>

<p>
Then he stroked the back of my head the wrong
way, the dear old way he has always stroked it.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>do</i> love you, sweetheart," he murmured, kissing
the nape of my neck.  "There never was a
Marguerite like mine."
</p>

<p>
It is at such moments that the tears come
unbidden, tears of intense happiness.
</p>

<p>
Will Dimbie ever realise how much I love him?
My words are few.  I remember what Nanty said,
although she has now recalled her advice.  I don't
seem to be able to let Dimbie know what he is to
me.  Human language is not sufficient, speech is so
bald.  Sometimes in the night, when he is asleep,
I press my lips to his kinky hair, but I'm always
afraid he will awake and find me out, and I whisper,
"God, I thank Thee for Dimbie."
</p>

<p>
A lark was singing rapturously above us far away
out of sight, a thrush was breathing forth liquid
notes of silver, and a little golden gorse bush was
giving of its best and sweetest to the inmates of the
grassy lane.
</p>

<p>
What a beautiful thing is a lane in which the
grass runs softly riotous.  A street of pure gold, as
it were transparent glass, was what St. John saw in
his vision.  To me such a street, hard and metallic,
would be a disappointment.  I want in my heaven
cool, grassy lanes, soothing and comforting to tired
feet.
</p>

<p>
"What a birthday!" said Dimbie.  "I want
always to stop at thirty-one, and sit on a bank
with you and look at your hair in the sun, sweetheart."
</p>

<p>
"You'd get tired of it."
</p>

<p>
"Never," he vowed.  "What a lucky thing it was
for me your getting mixed up in that wire netting.
Girls are very helpless."
</p>

<p>
"But they manage somehow to get out of their
difficulties," I laughed, and we sat a little closer.
"Marguerite," he said suddenly, "would you like
a&mdash;child?"
</p>

<p>
I felt the colour rise to my cheeks as I shook my
head.
</p>

<p>
He stooped and kissed me.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad," he whispered.  "I wouldn't either.
We don't want anyone but each other, do we?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps&mdash;some day," I faltered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps <i>some</i> day," he assented a little
reluctantly.  "People with children seem so beastly
selfish to everybody <i>but</i> the children.  They've no
thought for anybody else, no interest.  You say to
'em, 'My house was burnt down last night.'  They
look a little vague and reply, 'How unfortunate.
Johnny has contracted measles.'  Really anxious to
impress them, you go on to tell them that your
mother has just died from heart failure, and they
say, 'How distressing.  Mary has passed her matric.'  You
want to curse Mary, but you daren't.  They
represent all that is holy, all that is extraordinary
(in their own eyes), all that is happiness; they are
parents.  You stand outside the door of the holy of
holies.  You know not the meaning of the words
life, joy, fatherhood, motherhood.  The sun and
the moon only shine for them.  The stars twinkle,
and the flowers bloom, only for the children."
</p>

<p>
He paused and sighed deeply.  I laughed, and
patted his hand.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know all this?"
</p>

<p>
"I have a married sister, remember.  When she
went abroad with Gladys and Maxwell I was
unfeignedly relieved.  They were getting on my
nerves, father included."
</p>

<p>
"But this is the age of children, remember, the
golden age.  Before they were kept in the
background, now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They are never off the foreground," said Dimbie
gloomily.  "They are in the drawing-room monopolising
the entire attention of the guests.  If the
guests don't want 'em the mothers are pained.
You are a heartless brute, selfish and self-centred.
It never seems to strike them <i>they</i> are the ones who
are self-centred."
</p>

<p>
"But that is not the poor children's fault," I
said.  "Children are dears when they are properly
trained."
</p>

<p>
"No, perhaps not.  The children <i>might</i> be jolly,
simple, unself-conscious little beggars if they got
the chance, but they don't.  As it is, most of 'em
are detestable."
</p>

<p>
"But"&mdash;I began.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, Marg," he said, helping me up.  "You
can't make out a good case for the modern parents
however hard you try.  Let us be getting on."
</p>

<p>
We made straight for Sleepy Hollow and our pool
when we arrived at the woods, and set our cloth at
the edge of its banks.  Such a quiet pool, it might
be fast asleep.  No insects hum o'er its unruffed
surface.  No birds twitter in the tall sedges which
hug it on three sides.  No fish rise, for what would
be the use when there are no insects or flies.  Away
in every direction the pine trees stretch, filling the
air with their clean, resinous odour.
</p>

<p>
We spread our mackintoshes in the very sunniest
spot, and Dimbie threw himself on his back, while
I sat cross-legged in tailor fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you want any lunch?" I asked presently.
</p>

<p>
"Rather," he returned, sitting up.  "What have
you got&mdash;omelets?"
</p>

<p>
"That," I said, "is disagreeable of you.  Amelia's
efforts were well meant."
</p>

<p>
"Hope she won't have any more," he said, with
his mouth full of pie.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia will never cease to surprise us as long as
she lives with us.  She is a curious mixture of
extreme cleverness and astonishing simplicity.  And
I believe her heart's in the right place, though it is
difficult to tell, so surrounded is it by bones and
patches."
</p>

<p>
I fell to thinking of her, and forgot Dimbie and
the lunch.  Amelia will have much to answer for,
for displacement of my thoughts.  Before I only
thought of Dimbie; now Amelia edges in, try as I
will to keep her out.  Why should my mind be
taken up with a Cockney girl educated in the Mile
End Road?  I object.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie took me away from her.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, isn't it stunning here!  The sun is as
hot as in June.  I want a series of birthdays in
which to ride away with you farther and farther till
we reach the sea.  Then we can sit upon the sands
and tell glad stories of our love.  And you must
always wear that blue serge frock and let the sun
wander through your hair as it is doing now."
</p>

<p>
"Are you quite sure there is nothing more you
want?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I want to kiss you&mdash;that little spot on your
right cheek which is pink and sunburnt."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can't," I replied.  "If you move you
will upset the claret and glasses."
</p>

<p>
"Don't care," he said, and as he kissed me a
man appeared from among the pine trees.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" we both ejaculated, shooting back our heads.
</p>

<p>
He stood and looked at us with an amused expression.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind me," he said quite politely, seating
himself on the stump of a tree pretty close
to us.
</p>

<p>
"But I am afraid we do," Dimbie said equally
politely.
</p>

<p>
"I've seen that sort of thing dozens of times,"
he continued in a detached sort of manner.
</p>

<p>
We sat and eyed him indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"In fact, I rather like it," he went on imperturbably.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do you?"  Dimbie's sarcasm was sharp as
a knife.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I find it refreshing after my work.  I am
a balloonist, and have done considerable research
work in aerial flight.  I built an aerodrome once, a
steam-driven flying machine.  It went about a
quarter of a mile and killed my mother on the way."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I said, shocked.  Dimbie was staring at
the sky.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; sad, wasn't it?  But she was eighty-seven.
And I am sure, could she have had the choice, she
would have preferred a sudden, practically painless
death to a long, lingering illness."
</p>

<p>
"So did you build this aerodrome on purpose to
finish her off?" I inquired with interest.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie smothered a laugh, and the man looked
at me thoughtfully, but didn't seem offended.
</p>

<p>
"Well, no," he replied, "I can hardly say that.
I merely meant that it was just a bit of luck for my
mother.  I hope, by the way, I am not disturbing
you."
</p>

<p>
"Not very much," I answered, before Dimbie
could speak.
</p>

<p>
"That's right.  I don't like being <i>de trop</i>, or in
the way; get yourself disliked."
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be nothing to say to this, and
Dimbie and I peeped at one another and
endeavoured not to laugh.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<br />
PROFESSOR LEIGHRAIL
</p>

<p>
The stranger looked at us thoughtfully,
benevolently almost.  His face was extremely thin and
worn, his hands delicate, and his boots too large
for him.  There was a refinement about his whole
personality above the ordinary, and I liked him.
</p>

<p>
"Have some lunch?" Dimbie said, beginning to
unbend.  "There isn't any pie left, but there's lots
of bread and cheese and some fruit."
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you.  I have some lunch in my
pocket, so with your permission I will eat it with you."
</p>

<p>
He produced an envelope, and taking out a brown
lozenge began to suck it.  When he had finished
this he extracted a second, and then a third.  Then
from his coat pocket he produced a tin cup, dipped
it into a stream which feeds the pool, drank, returned
it to his pocket, and leant back in a finished way.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all you are going to have?" I couldn't
resist asking in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.  "Being a balloonist, I am
obliged to eat sparingly, so take my meat in a
concentrated form.  I'm one of the thinnest men in
Great Britain, and usually wear two coats to hide
my lean appearance.  Would you like to feel my
ribs?"
</p>

<p>
He asked this simple though somewhat unusual
question in exactly the same way as a man might
ask you to see his Velasquez.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you," we both said together.
</p>

<p>
"They're worth feeling," he said, a little disappointed.
</p>

<p>
We assured him of our belief in his veracity.
</p>

<p>
"A bit prudish, eh?"  He turned towards me.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least," I replied indignantly; "but
to be quite candid, I'm not very interested in your
ribs.  You see, we don't know you very well yet,"
I added, to soften the blow.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you live?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
We told him in guarded language.
</p>

<p>
"Within two miles of Leith Hill.  Pretty country?"
</p>

<p>
We nodded.
</p>

<p>
"What's the name of your house?" was his next
question.
</p>

<p>
"Have you taken a great fancy to us?" Dimbie
inquired sweetly.
</p>

<p>
"Very," he said.  "Don't remember taking a
greater fancy to anybody.  You seem so ridiculously
happy and young."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie's and my face, I fear, wore the expression
of happiness fleeting.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going now," he said rising.  "If you had
favoured me with the name of your house I might
have dropped in on you some day from my balloon."
</p>

<p>
This sounded rather interesting.
</p>

<p>
"One Tree Cottage," we said together.
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Might have known it would be a cottage.  You
both look so exactly like a cottage&mdash;lattice windows,
roses and honeysuckle thrown in.  Quite common-place,
if you only knew it."
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, sir," said Dimbie in an
extinguishing voice.
</p>

<p>
The stranger smiled good-humouredly.
</p>

<p>
"Now you're going to get offended with me,"
said he, "and I am sorry.  But you take my word
for it, there are scores of young couples in
lattice-windowed cottages&mdash;or would like to be in
lattice-windowed cottages&mdash;with honeysuckle and roses
and a baby.  It's the craze now to live in a cottage.
We avoided them as you would the plague in my
young days&mdash;insanitary, stuffy, no gas, no hot
water, floors with hills in them, walls with mould
in them, skirtings with rats in them.  Yours is like
that, I expect."
</p>

<p>
We vouchsafed no reply.
</p>

<p>
"And your drains&mdash;I expect they're all wrong.
Most cottage drains are abominable."
</p>

<p>
"We have a drain-bamboo," I said eagerly.
"Amelia uses it regularly."
</p>

<p>
"Amelia sounds a sensible young person.  I
should like to see her and the cottage.  I'm interested
in young people.  I was young myself once, though
you mightn't think it."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it was some time ago," I observed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's a long time."  His eyes became
reminiscent.  "I jumped into an old man the day my
wife died, very old.  Then I took up ballooning.  I
thought that might prove the surest method of
ending myself&mdash;short of suicide.  Don't like
suicide&mdash;unpleasant and dramatic."  He still spoke with
cheerful detachment.
</p>

<p>
"And are you a professional balloonist&mdash;ascend
from the Crystal Palace and that sort of thing?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me with amused surprise, I imagined,
for an instant; in fact, he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I am not a professional.  I am engaged
on various work.  Generally pretty busy.  Ballooning
is my hobby.  If you've plenty to do you can't
be lonely."
</p>

<p>
"We shall be very glad to see you," I said,
suddenly feeling very sorry for this eccentric person.
A shadow had crept across his face as he had spoken.
How dreadful to be lonely, I thought.  "Our village
is Pine Tree Valley.  We searched about till we
found a place set among the pines.  I love them so.
Perhaps you will dine with us one evening?"
</p>

<p>
"It is very kind of you," he said quickly, "but I
never dine with people.  They invariably eat fattening,
indigestible things.  If I went out to dinner I
shouldn't have ribs like knife blades."  He spoke
quite proudly.  "But I should like to call and see
the baby."
</p>

<p>
"There isn't a baby."  Dimbie's voice was irritable,
and my cheeks were scarlet.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," he said.  "We hadn't one either."
</p>

<p>
"And did you mind?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit while Amabella was alive.  But when
she died I was a great deal alone, and the house
seemed big and empty.  I think it is a mistake not
to have children."  He looked at me a trifle severely.
</p>

<p>
"We've only been married a little over three
months," Dimbie explained apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well, that makes a difference, of course.
You've got plenty of time.  Good-bye, and may I
give you my card?"
</p>

<p>
He fished one out of the pocket which contained
the tin mug.  It was a little soiled and wet.
</p>

<p>
"It is unnecessary to give me one of yours," he
said with a smile.  "I don't want to know your
name.  I shall just ask for Mr. and Mrs. Smilingface,
who live in a tiresome, typhoid-inviting,
creeper-covered cottage.  Good-bye," and before
we could speak he had gone.
</p>

<p>
With interest we examined the card:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
  Mr. MONTGOMERY LEIGHRAIL,<br />
  THE GREY HOUSE,<br />
  ESHER.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dimbie sat down and opened his blue eyes so
wide that the crook in his nose moved in sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Marg," he said solemnly, "do you know what
you have done?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I replied; "hurry up and tell me."
</p>

<p>
"You have refused to feel the ribs of one of the
greatest scientists of the world.  That was Professor
Leighrail."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he ought to have known better than to
have asked me," I said, refusing to be impressed.
</p>

<p>
At which Dimbie fell back and chuckled softly
for some minutes.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<h4>
A LETTER FROM MISS FAIRBROTHER
</h4>

<p>
Beyond the fact that I have received a letter
from Miss Fairbrother, there seems to be
nothing of any real importance to-day to enter in
my "daily-round."  I call my journal my "daily-round,"
though it isn't anything of the kind, for I
only scribble in it when I have nothing else to do,
and when I am waiting for Dimbie to come home.
I always seem to be waiting for Dimbie to come
home, and yet I don't always write in my
"daily-round"; I wait for moods.  Dimbie calls it my
recipe book.  He says it looks like one, with its
ruled lines and mottled brawn stiff covers.  He
wants to read it, but this I won't permit.  I say,
"Dimbie, within those covers are the meanderings
of a new wife, I mean a newly-made wife.  It could
be of no interest to you to read: 'I have ordered
two pounds of steak for dinner.  Amelia is
unusually squeaky to-day,' but they are of vital
interest to me."  Journals can only be of interest
to the people who write them.  There are, of course,
exceptions, such as Pepys and Evelyn&mdash;I have
not read either of them, but they may have made
notes of really important events.  I don't, for I
have none to note.  Besides, I never know the date.
Properly constructed journals have dates.  I only
know the month we are in.  I have an idea whether
it is the beginning or the end, but if anyone were to
say to me, "What is the day of the month?" I
should be extremely flurried.  I always find, too,
that people who ask you the date know it much
better themselves.  If you say it is the sixteenth
they flatly contradict you and say they are sure it is
the seventeenth.  Peter was always like that.  He
would sit down at the writing-table in the library
with a calendar hanging right in front of his nose,
and would suddenly pounce upon poor mother with,
"What is the date?"  Mother, not knowing any
more about dates than I, would gently refer him to
the calendar.  Peter would not be referred to
calendars.  Mother should know dates the same as other
sensible people.  Then there would be ructions.
Peter would show mother and me what could be done
with an ordinary pair of lungs.  I used to think
what splendid bellows Peter's lungs would make.
One day I ventured upon this to him, I asked him
to blow up the fire.  I shall never forget the result.
His facial contortions and the noise he made were
out of the common.
</p>

<p>
I am wondering if he makes those noises now.
Mother was always a little gentler and more yielding
to him than I, so perhaps the house is quieter
since I left.  I don't see them very much.  Not
possessing a carriage, and the journey by train being
a little cross country, we do not exchange many
visits.  Peter won't allow mother to come alone,
and of course when he comes everything is spoilt.
He does not believe in private confidential talks
between women.  He says that most of it is
ill-natured gossip, and I have never heard mother say
an unkind word of anybody in her life.
</p>

<p>
I did not mean to write of Peter this morning.
My head was full of Miss Fairbrother.
</p>

<p>
Such a delightful letter from her.  Dimbie was
as much interested in it as I.  She says&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'I am thirty-five to-day.  Yes, I have reached
half the allotted age of man.  The Psalmist was a
little mean and skimpy, I think, to limit one's years
to threescore and ten.  Probably he was old for
his age, having crowded a good deal into his life.
And all those wives and sons of his were enough to
make any man feel tired.'"
</p>

<p>
I looked up and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"'Thirty-five will appear to twenty-three a great
and mysterious age&mdash;mysterious in the way that
death is mysterious; a state at which to arrive at
some dim and future period&mdash;very dim, very far
off when you are but twenty-three.
</p>

<p>
"'And yet my years sit lightly upon me.  I can
still run, though not so swiftly as of old.  I can still
laugh, though India is very hot and very sad in some
of its aspects.  I still wear cotton frocks&mdash;perhaps
the last foolishly; but what is one to do in an Indian
climate, and when one has to count up the pennies
in readiness for the old age which <i>must</i> come?
Muslin I eschew as being too airy and girlish for one
of rounded proportions, but mercerised cotton is my
salvation.  Praised be the Lancashire cotton mills!
Do you happen to have met with mercerised cotton?
It is deceitful, for it tries to cheat you into believing
that when you don it you straightway have a silken
appearance.  It may deceive <i>you</i>, but it certainly
does not deceive the other women of the station.
You read in their uplifted glance "six-three," which
means sixpence three farthings.  You don't care
dreadfully, for are you not cool and most suitably
attired as a governess?
</p>

<p>
"'You ask me, dear Marguerite, what I am doing.
I am still existing in a pink bungalow endeavouring
to teach two poor, hot, sticky children.  Of course
it is cool now, but the hot weather will return once
more, and then they are going home to that cool,
green garden whose other name is England, and my
work will be finished.  This makes the fourth
batch of children who have left me during the years
I have been here.  And now that garden is calling
me, calling me with a voice not to be resisted, and
I too am "going home."
</p>

<p>
"'You, little old pupil, will be one of the first
persons upon whom I shall leave cards.  Marguerite
married is a person of importance now.  Her two
fair pigtails went "up" long ago, but she will always
remain the little old pupil to me.
</p>

<p>
"'Then, too, I badly want to see this wonderful
husband of yours.  He won't be nice to me.  A
young husband, I think, is rarely devoted to his wife's
old friends.  But I shan't mind.  I shan't resent
it.  I shall understand.'"
</p>

<p>
I stopped again to laugh up at Dimbie, who was
leaning over me.
</p>

<p>
"She seems a very sensible woman," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
"There never was anyone quite so sensible as
Miss Fairbrother," I returned.  "She could even
manage Peter in a fashion, and mother was devoted
to her.  One of the very cleverest things mother ever
did was to find Miss Fairbrother."
</p>

<p>
"Please finish," said Dimbie, "or I shall miss my
train."
</p>

<p>
"'Your charming present, for which many thanks,
has already raised me some inches in the eyes of the
women out here.  For long they have been trying
to persuade me into wearing a hair-frame.  You
will probably know the thing I mean&mdash;a round,
evil-looking, hairy bolster, over which unpleasantness
you comb your own hair, hoping to delude mankind
into the belief that you have come of parentage of
Samsonian characteristics.  Now this beautiful
jewelled comb of yours adds somewhat to my stature
when, with an attempt&mdash;somewhat feeble, I fear&mdash;at
high coiffured hair, I swim, like Meredith's
heroines, or try to swim, into dinner.  They almost
pardon my lack of a bolster when their eyes rest upon
such modishness.  A little less spinster-governess,
they think.  And I translate their thought and smile.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"'Always your most affectionate,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'EGOIST.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Egoist, indeed!" I said musingly, as I folded
the letter and took a photograph out of my desk&mdash;a
photograph of a strong, smiling face, with low,
broad forehead, over which the hair was parted on
one side, clear, unflinching eyes, and large mobile
mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you put her into a frame somewhere
about the room?" asked Dimbie.  "It is a fine face."
</p>

<p>
"Because I promised her she should never be on
view.  She imagined she was plain.  I think clever
people are as sensitive about their looks as stupid."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so," said Dimbie, with a fine disregard
of all trains.  "Was she very clever?"
</p>

<p>
I was pleased at his interest in my much-loved
governess.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," I replied.  "I am not clever
enough to know.  But whatever she said seemed to
me intensely interesting.  Mother and even Peter
were inclined to hang on her words.  She was so
witty, so gay; she had such a sense of humour.
You see, she was only twenty-eight when she left.
She came to us when she was twenty, just after
taking a most fearful degree.  Mother says Peter
most strongly objected to this degree; that he said
women should only take things like measles and
scarlet fever, and be feminine, remembering their
place in nature, and not try to be clever; and that
if only Miss Fairbrother would do her hair properly
and wear white-lace petticoats, she even might get
married&mdash;there was no telling.  And mother argued
that she did not wish Miss Fairbrother to be married
till she had thoroughly grounded me and prepared
me for that high-class boarding school, Lynton House.
</p>

<p>
"And I recollect Peter snorted at this, and said
that if Miss Fairbrother could just manage to knock
a little writing, reading, and arithmetic into my
head and teach me to sew and knit, he, for one,
would be satisfied.  And he forbade anyone&mdash;man
or woman&mdash;to instruct me in the art of painting
flowers, afterwards to be framed and stuck on his
walls.  I cannot convey to you the scorn in his
voice as he shouted the words 'painting flowers.'"
</p>

<p>
"I think he was right there," said Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"So do I," I laughed; "but Peter had forgotten
that the painting of still life was a product of a
bygone age.  To imagine Miss Fairbrother teaching
me such an art would be to imagine her teaching
me how to embroider wool-work pictures.  Granny
worked two fierce cats with spreading, startled
whiskers, in Berlin wool.  They adorn my old
nursery walls to this day.  Miss Fairbrother made
up lovely, exciting tales about them and their habits,
and for some little time, till I grew older, I was
under the impression they left their frames at night
and sported on the tiles.  We called them
Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Balfour."
</p>

<p>
"I must go," said Dimbie.  "The cats are most
interesting, and so is Miss Fairbrother, but I have
our living to make.  What do you say to asking
her to visit us for a bit when she arrives?"
</p>

<p>
He spoke in a nonchalant way, and I looked up
quickly.  He had said he shouldn't have anyone to
stay with us under twelve months.  His back was
turned to me, so I couldn't see his face.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want her?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> want her?  Certainly not.  But you sound so
keen on her, and&mdash;<i>she</i> sounds lonely."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Dimbie," I said, "you are a pet.  I
appreciate your unselfishness, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, write and ask her before I change my
mind.  I dare say she'll have the sense to clear off
and leave us alone in the evenings."
</p>

<p>
"But shall you care dreadfully?" I queried.
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, not dreadfully.  No man hankers after
a strange woman in the house, especially when he's
already got a dear one like you.  But I want you
to be happy, Marg."  His voice became very tender.
"I don't want you to be lonely.  I want your days
to be a perpetual delight."  He crossed the room
and stroked the back of my head.
</p>

<p>
"And so they are," I replied, laying my cheek
on his sleeve.  "One long delight.  Sometimes I
wonder why God has given <i>me</i> so much happiness.
I don't deserve it any more than anyone else.  Peter,
all my worries are behind me; in front of me is joy.
I seem to have stepped on to a little green island of
content, set in the midst of a sun-kissed ocean.  The
waves lap the shores lovingly; the breezes linger
in our hair with a caress.  You and I are alone,
Dimbie."
</p>

<p>
And he laid his lips on mine for a moment, and
then he left me.

CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<h4>
SORROW OVERTAKES ME
</h4>

<p>
I take up my writing again, or rather my book
is propped up in front of me, and I wonder how
long ago was that.  It tires my head to think.
My dates are more confused than ever.  I know it
is May, but what part of May?  I look out of my
window&mdash;the bed has been wheeled into the window&mdash;and
I see the chestnut is crowned with its white
lights, and the broom bush near the gate is a mass
of golden blossom.  It is the end of May; it must
be nearly June, for they tell me the season is late,
that there has been much cold and rain.  I am
almost glad to have missed that.  I like my May
to be smiling and gladsome, not frowning and
petulant.  But to-day she has put on her best bib
and tucker, and with the conceit of a frail human
being I weave the pleasant fancy that it is done in
my honour.  "They are giving me a welcome,
nurse," I say.  "The apple tree is rosy pink with
pleasure at my greeting blown to it through the
window."
</p>

<p>
And nurse, putting on her bonnet and cloak to
go out, tells me to hush and not talk so much.
</p>

<p>
They have been telling me to hush for so long
it seems; but now I am tired of hushing, tired of
being good.
</p>

<p>
I told Dr. Renton this yesterday, and he smiled
and said it showed I was getting better.  "Not
getting, got," I returned.  "When may I get up?"  And
he said he would come and tell me on Wednesday;
and this is Monday, three o'clock in the afternoon,
and I have forty-eight long hours to get
through before I know.
</p>

<p>
Nurse is just a trifle cross with my impatience.
She becomes irritable when I talk about getting up.
She says how would I like to lie for some months;
and I reply not at all&mdash;that it would be quite
impossible for Dimbie to get along without my being
ever at his elbow, and that it would be still more
impossible for me to remain in a recumbent position
when an upright one is possible.
</p>

<p>
I was glad of this "lying down" when I was in
pain.  Pain!  There was a time when I had not
known the meaning of the word.  It had passed me
by, left me alone.  I had seen it on a few people's
faces; then I thought it was discontent, now I know
it was pain.
</p>

<p>
How do people bear it&mdash;always? keep their
reason?  Does God try them till they are just at
breaking-point, and then gently remove them? or
send them the blessing of unconsciousness?
</p>

<p>
They say I lay for hours away in a world of my
own.  I did not flinch when they touched me,
moved me, laid me on my bed, left me in the hands
of the doctors.
</p>

<p>
And yet I would have stayed if I could&mdash;kept
my brain unclouded to help Dimbie when he picked
me up, disentangled me (he always seems to be
disentangling me from something) from the wrecked
bicycle, and laid me away from that terrible wall.  I
did so want to help him.  His white, set face recalled
me a moment from the haze of unconsciousness
which was settling upon me, and I whispered,
"Dimbie, dear!" but I never heard his answer.
The mist became an impenetrable fog, and I left
him alone with his difficulties.
</p>

<p>
I don't know now what I wanted to say.
</p>

<p>
He teazes me with lips that won't keep steady,
and says I wished to know if my hat were straight.
</p>

<p>
"Dear goose," I protest, "it was something to do
with the black chicken my wheel caught against in
my headlong flight down the hill.  I tried to dodge
it&mdash;it was such a nice, wee black chicken, but it
dodged too, and&mdash;I couldn't help it."  And the
tears tremble in my eyes&mdash;just from weakness.  "I
think I wanted you to go back up the hill and help
it, for we were both in a very sorry plight."
</p>

<p>
And Dimbie, to my surprise, turns away to the
window and says we shall have rain.  If it had
rained every time Dimbie has predicted it during
my illness we should have been obliged to take
refuge in an ark and float about the surface of the
waters.
</p>

<p>
I am very cheerful now.  I am getting better.
What joy, what hope those words contain for those
who have been sick and sorry.  I wiped away the
last tear this morning when mother went.  Peter's
letters had become so tiresome that I told her she
had better go.  And as I threw a kiss to the back
of her pretty bonnet as she disappeared through the
gate the tear was for her and not for myself.
</p>

<p>
"I would like to cut Peter for life, and I would
but for your sake, poor dear little mother," I
murmured savagely.  And nurse, who entered the room
at that moment, said, "You've moved."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I replied, a little guiltily; "but as the
pain has almost gone, I thought it could not do
any harm just to sit up for a moment and watch
mother go."
</p>

<p>
"You've sat up?" she cried in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  I snuggled my head down on the pillow.
"I think I'll have a little sleep now, nurse."
</p>

<p>
"I shall tell Dr. Renton and Mr. Westover."  Her
voice was relentless.
</p>

<p>
"If you do I shall sit up again, and refuse to
take my beef-tea," I asseverated.  "Besides, it is
sneaky to tell tales."
</p>

<p>
Her lips twitched as she poured some beef-tea
into my feeder.
</p>

<p>
"If you sit up again I shall give up the case."
</p>

<p>
Her voice reminded me of the stone wall I had
smashed against, and I told her so; but she was
not to be moved.
</p>

<p>
"Will you give me your faithful promise that
you will not sit up again?  I am responsible to
Dr. Renton and Mr. Rovell.  I have nursed Mr. Rovell's
cases for years, and I do not wish to lose
his work."
</p>

<p>
She stood over me like an angel with a flaming
sword.
</p>

<p>
"I promise, nursey, dear," I said meekly.  "But
you won't take my manuscript book from me?  I
can write quite easily lying down.  You see, it has
stiff covers."
</p>

<p>
"You can keep that," she conceded.  "Are you
doing French exercises?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I said gravely.  "At present I am writing
what you might call 'patience exercises.'  When I
am at work I forget how long it is before
Mr. Westover will be home.  I forget my back.  I
forget General Macintosh and my other worries.
I am so absorbed in keeping my spelling and grammar
in order that I have no time for other matters.
You see, if I were to di&mdash;go before my husband,
he might wish to see these exercises, and I should
not like him to smile at my mistakes."
</p>

<p>
"You are not going before Mr. Westover," she
said briskly.  "All my patients think they are going
to die.  I am not altogether sorry, as they are so
sorry for themselves that it keeps them absorbed
and out of mischief.  Were they not taken up in
picturing their husbands flinging themselves on to
their graves in a frenzy of grief they might be
picking their bandages off."
</p>

<p>
I giggled and choked into my beef-tea.
</p>

<p>
"I hate beef-tea," I said when I had recovered.
"Besides, it is only a stimulant, and not a food."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I saw it in mother's medical book."  I spoke
carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Where is it?" Her voice was sharp.
</p>

<p>
"Down the bed."
</p>

<p>
She dived gently but firmly under the clothes and
removed the book which I had had such trouble in
purloining from mother by bribing Amelia.
</p>

<p>
"Is there anything else you have read in it?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I said, "I've not had time.  I was just
running through the index when my eye caught the
word beef-tea."
</p>

<p>
"What were you going to look for?"
</p>

<p>
"Spines," I returned promptly.  "As mine has
gone a bit wrong I thought I would like a little
information about it."
</p>

<p>
"And I'm just glad I caught you in time," she
said sternly.  "That is why I like nursing men so
much better than women.  Men are too scared
about themselves to go poking their noses into
medical books, but women are so curious about
their own cases that there is no holding them in.
They look at their charts&mdash;I have seen them doing
it in hospital when the nurses' backs were turned.
They take their own temperatures, feel their own
pulses, and ask a thousand questions which no
sensible nurse would dream of answering."
</p>

<p>
"I have not asked silly questions," I argued.
</p>

<p>
"No, because up to now you have been far too
poorly.  What is it you want to know?"
</p>

<p>
"When I may get up," I said eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you won't find that in a medical book.
Did you expect to do so?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no.  I wanted to find out of what spines
are made; the diseases to which they are subject,"
I said rather lamely.
</p>

<p>
"Yours isn't a disease, but an accident.
Dr. Renton will tell you fast enough when you may
get up."  She put the book into a drawer.
</p>

<p>
"It seems so long to Wednesday."
</p>

<p>
"He is not coming till next week."
</p>

<p>
"Not till next week," I said blankly, "and this
is only Monday.  He said he would come on
Wednesday."
</p>

<p>
"No, he didn't.  You assumed that he would."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I call it most neglectful."
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing to come for now," she said
soothingly.  "It is a good way from Dorking to
Pine Tree Valley, and of course, as he said, there
is no good in running up a long bill."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe he said that," I cried heatedly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he didn't," she admitted; "but you
mustn't excite yourself.  I am going to lower the
blinds.  You said you were sleepy."
</p>

<p>
"I never was so wide awake in all my life," I
almost sobbed.  "I think it is mean of Dr. Renton.
I did so want to get up this week and smell the
wallflowers before they were quite over.  I think
they were late in flowering for my sake.  I put
them in and they waited for me, and now I shall
miss them."
</p>

<p>
"I will bring some in for you to smell."
</p>

<p>
"It won't be the same," I cried petulantly.  "You
don't understand, nurse.  To enjoy wallflowers to
the full the sun must be shining upon them, and you
must stand a little away from the bed, and the west
wind must come along gently, bearing in its arms
the scent&mdash;just a breath of warm fragrance,
and&mdash;well, that is the way to enjoy wallflowers,
and&mdash;oh, nurse, I do so want to bury my face in
them."  I tailed off to a wail.
</p>

<p>
She walked to the window and lowered the blind.
</p>

<p>
"If you carry on in this way you will never smell
wallflowers again."  She was cross.  "I shall leave
you now, and perhaps you'll be calmer when I come
back."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nurse," I said penitently, "don't go.  I will
be good.  And I want you to read me <i>Peggy and
Other Tales</i>.  You read it so beautifully."
</p>

<p>
<i>Peggy</i> is a dear black book which belonged to
mother when she was a little girl.  It was my especial
favourite when I was seven, and it has been quite the
most suitable form of literature for a weak, fractious
invalid with a hazy brain and wobbly emotions.
</p>

<p>
Nurse laughed as she picked up the book.
</p>

<p>
"Are you not tired of it?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I replied.  "<i>Peggy</i> comforts me very
much.  And when you have finished her, you might
read me something out of <i>Ecclesiastes</i>.  It is not that
I am feeling religious or think I am going to die,
but the language is so musical and grand: '<i>Or ever
the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken,
or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel
broken at the cistern.</i>'  It is the repetition of the word
'broken' I like.  Now had I been writing the verse
I should have searched about for another verb&mdash;smashed,
cracked&mdash;and straightway the beauty of
the lines would have been spoiled.  But Solomon
was so sure of himself.  He knew the word 'broken'
was just the right word even if used three times
and so he used it."
</p>

<p>
Nurse sat and looked at me with surprise chasing
across her face.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me," she said, "I never notice things like
that when I am reading."
</p>

<p>
"What do <i>you</i> notice?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't think I notice anything.  I just
want to hurry on to where the man proposes."
</p>

<p>
"But men don't often propose in the Bible, with
the exception of Jacob," I said laughing.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't refer to the Bible.  I was thinking of
books generally."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you never notice how a book is written.
You just want to get on with the plot."
</p>

<p>
"That's it," she agreed.  "I hate descriptions.
They tire me to death, especially as to how the
characters feel inside about things.  Heroines are
the worst of all.  They commune with themselves
for hours over the merest trifles."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean as to whether they will get a new
dress, or engage a man to put a new washer on the
bathroom tap which drips?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," she said, a little impatiently, "I can't
explain; it is not over things like that they worry
themselves.  But you look tired.  You are talking
too much.  I will read you to sleep."
</p>

<p>
She spoke with finality, and picked up the book.
</p>

<p>
As she read aloud in a somewhat sonorous voice
I lay and watched the tree-tops.  "Next week," I
thought, "I shall be out of doors once more.  I
shall visit the frog-pond with Dimbie.  I shall
wander through the fields with him.  His arm will
clasp mine, as I shall be weak, and we shall sit and
rest under a white hawthorn hedge.  The scent will
be heavy on the still evening air.  The fields of
clover and wheat will&mdash;&mdash;"  And at this point I left
<i>Peggy</i> and nurse, and fell asleep.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<h4>
DR. RENTON BREAKS SOME NEWS TO ME
</h4>

<p>
The week has passed at last&mdash;in the daytime
on leaden feet, on wings of gold in the evening
when, as the clock has struck six, Dimbie and
happiness have entered my room hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Only four more days, dear one," Dimbie has
said hopefully.
</p>

<p>
"Only three more days.  Nurse must begin to
air your tea-gown."
</p>

<p>
"Only two more.  I am putting bamboo poles
through the small wicker chair.  You may not be
able to walk at first, and nurse and I will carry
you.  I could manage you alone, you are only a
feather in weight, but I might hurt you&mdash;such a
frail Marguerite my little wife looks."
</p>

<p>
"Is it the drain-bamboo you are using?" I ask
demurely.  "For Amelia might object."  And
Dimbie laughs like a happy boy.
</p>

<p>
"Only one more day.  To-morrow you will meet
me at the door.  Nurse will help you there, and then
she will go away, and&mdash;we shall be alone."  His
voice vibrates with happiness and my cheeks glow.
</p>

<p>
"Have you missed me, Dimbie?" I whisper.
"Have you enjoyed pouring out your own tea and
finding your slippers and working in the garden
alone?"
</p>

<p>
And he smiles tenderly and says he hasn't missed
me one little bit, and can't I see it in his face?
And nurse who comes into the room says "Ahem!"  Her
throat often seems a little troublesome.
</p>

<p>
And now to-morrow has come.  Dr. Renton may
walk in at any minute, and I press my finger to my
wrist to try to hush the beating.
</p>

<p>
Nurse has put me into my best blue silk jacket,
and my hair has been done&mdash;well, not in the very
latest Parisian mode, but its two plaits are tied with
new blue ribbons.  She has propped me up so that I
may see the lane and know the exact moment in
which Dr. Renton may drive down it.
</p>

<p>
I persuaded her to go for her walk as soon as
lunch was over.  I told her Dr. Renton never came,
as she herself knew, much before half-past three,
and that I felt unusually well.
</p>

<p>
And as soon as ever I heard the click of the gate
and knew she had gone I rang the tortoise&mdash;the
bell which always lives on the other pillow&mdash;for
Amelia.
</p>

<p>
She appeared, very dirty.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you're not dressed," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ring to tell me that, mum?  Because I
knewed it."
</p>

<p>
Her attitude was not that of impertinence, but
of inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," I replied quickly.  "I want you to
bring me up one of the volumes of the encyclopædia.
I don't know the number, but it will have SPI on
the back."
</p>

<p>
I spoke nervously, for I felt guilty.  I was about
to embark upon an act of deception.  Would
Amelia detect me?  But, for a wonder, she left the
room without a comment.
</p>

<p>
In a minute she was back.
</p>

<p>
"There is no volume with SPI on it," she
announced.  "There is one with SIB and SZO on
it, mum."
</p>

<p>
"That will do," I said eagerly.  "It will be in
that."
</p>

<p>
She brought it with a running accompaniment of
squeaks and gasps.
</p>

<p>
"Three at a time, mum."
</p>

<p>
"Three at a time!  What?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Stairs, mum."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," I said, "it is very foolish of you,
Amelia.  Your breathing resembles a gramophone
when you wind it up.  I shan't require anything
further, thank you; but please get dressed.  I should
like you to be neat when Dr. Renton arrives, and he
will probably have tea with me.  I don't know
how it is you are so late."
</p>

<p>
"I do, mum."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
My question was answered by another.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any idea what I do after lunch, mum?
Do you think I am skipping or playing marbles?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," I said hastily, "I am sure you are
not, Amelia."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I'll tell you what I do, so as you
won't be wonderin' why I'm not dressed by
half-past two."  She spoke volubly.  "I washes up the
lunch things&mdash;nurse's now as well; she's too grand
to so much as put a kettle on.  Then I sweeps up
the kitchen, sides up the hearth, brushes the kettle,
cleans the handle&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What do you do that for?" I asked with interest.
</p>

<p>
"For fun, of course."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Amelia!</i>" I said rebukingly.
</p>

<p>
"Beggin' your pardon, mum, but it seemed such
a foolish question&mdash;meanin' no offence to you.  I
cleans the handle, which is copper here&mdash;it was
brass at Tompkinses'&mdash;to get the dirt and smoke
off.  You never got your hands black in lifting <i>my</i>
kettle, did you now?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I have ever lifted it," I rejoined.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," she said in a superior way, "of
course you can't know; but people who knows
anything at all about a house knows that generals'
kettles are mostly black.  Then I scrubs the table,
dusts the kitchen, feeds the canary, and waters the
geranium, which is looking that sickly-like I'm
ashamed of the tradespeople seeing it.  The butcher
only says to me yesterday, 'I see you are a bit of a
horticulturist, miss.'"
</p>

<p>
She stopped, breathless.
</p>

<p>
"You certainly are very busy," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Busy isn't the word.  I'm like a fire-escape
from morning till night."
</p>

<p>
I think she meant fire-engine, and I was not sorry
when she departed, for I was anxious to get to my
encyclopædia.
</p>

<p>
I turned the pages rapidly&mdash;Sphygmograph,
Spice Islands, Spider, Spikenard, Spinach, Spinal
Cord.  "Ah, here we are!" I said delightedly.  In
a moment my spirits drooped.  "See Physiology,
vol. xix. p. 34.  For diseases affecting the Spinal
Cord, see Ataxy (Locomotor), Paralysis, Pathology,
and Surgery."
</p>

<p>
I gave a deep sigh.  I always have disliked the
<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>.  From the moment
Dimbie introduced it to our happy home I have had a
feeling of unrest.  It appears to think you have
nothing to do with your time beyond playing "hunt
the slipper" with it.  You wish to look up a subject
like dog.  With a certain amount of faith and hope
you approach your encyclopædia.  Dog refers you
to Canine.  You check your impatience.  Canine
refers you to Faithfulness.  A bad word, if you were
a man, would then be used; but you are not a man,
so you only stamp your foot.  Faithfulness refers
you to Gelert, and you hurt yourself rather badly as
you replace the volume.  You give up dog.  You
would prefer your pet dying before your very eyes
to searching any more heavy volumes.
</p>

<p>
When Dimbie first saw the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i> advertised in the Daily Mail he became very
enthusiastic, and after talking about it for some
time commented upon my lack of interest in the
subject.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Marg, they are giving it away!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," I said, rousing myself, "that is quite a
different thing.  I like people who give books away.
When will they arrive?"
</p>

<p>
"When I said, 'Giving it away,'" Dimbie
explained, hedging, "I meant that the payments
would be by such easy instalments that we couldn't
possibly miss them.  And a fumed oak bookcase
will be thrown in free."
</p>

<p>
I became interested in the bookcase, and when
it arrived I wasn't, for it was black and varnishy
and sticky, and very far removed from fumed oak
as I knew it.  I gave it to Amelia for her pans,
and we ordered another from the joiner, who
charged us £4 for it, money down, as we were
strangers.
</p>

<p>
We don't find the payment of the instalment each
month in the least easy.  In fact, we almost go
without fire and food to meet it.
</p>

<p>
I rang the tortoise sharply.  The encyclopædia
should be made to divulge that which I wished to
know.  I would not be hoodwinked.
</p>

<p>
"Please bring me volumes PHY, LOC, PAR,
PAT, and SUR," I said to Amelia, who was buttoning
her black bodice all wrong.  "And where's your cap?"
</p>

<p>
"In my pocket, mum."  She produced it, fastening
it on wrong end foremost with two hair-pins
which once might have been black.
</p>

<p>
"It is an unsuitable place to keep it," I
pronounced.  "And where are your cuffs?"
</p>

<p>
Amelia smiled.
</p>

<p>
"They've melted, mum.  I forgot they was
india-rubber, and I put them into the oven after washing
them, and when I went for them they was just
drippin'."
</p>

<p>
I sighed deeply.
</p>

<p>
"Well, bring me the volumes.  Do you remember
which I mentioned?"
</p>

<p>
"No, mum."
</p>

<p>
"I will write them down for you."
</p>

<p>
"Why not have the whole forty, mum?" she said,
as she took the slip of paper.
</p>

<p>
"Those five will be sufficient, thank you," I said
coldly.
</p>

<p>
Her panting was naturally excessive as she laid
the volumes on the bed.
</p>

<p>
"They are rather heavy for me to lift, Amelia,"
I said.  "Please open PHY for me and turn over
the leaves till you come to Physiology, and then go
and see about some tea.  I don't feel I can wait till
four o'clock to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Would you like some drippin' toast, mum?
I've got some lovely beef drippin' from the last
sirloin which master carved all wrong.  He cut it
just like ribs&mdash;I mean the under-cut&mdash;instead of
across.  He'd have catched it if he'd been
Mrs. Tompkins' husband."
</p>

<p>
"But he isn't, you see."  My manner was extinguishing.
</p>

<p>
"You're a bit cross, mum?" she suggested.
</p>

<p>
"No, Amelia, I'm not, only tired&mdash;tired of
waiting for Dr. Renton&mdash;tired, sick to death of
lying here.  Do you know how long I have lain here?"
</p>

<p>
"Seven weeks come Wednesday," she replied
promptly.
</p>

<p>
"No, Amelia.  You have miscalculated.  You
have minimised the period of time.  I have lain
here," and I stretched my arms wide, "a thousand
days and nights, a million days and nights; and each
day and night has stretched away to eternity."
</p>

<p>
"Lawks, mum!"  Her corsets cracked.
</p>

<p>
"Lawks! doesn't express it, Amelia.  Go now
and put on the kettle with the clean copper handle.
No dripping toast, thank you.  I am sure nurse
would disapprove.  She has a tiresome habit of
disapproving of most things.  Besides, I don't feel
like common fare.  I want something to take me
out of myself and to uplift me.  Something delicate,
subtle, ambrosial.  Do you know what ambrosial
means?  No?  Ambrosia means food for the gods.
I want food for the gods&mdash;iced rose leaves, a
decoction of potpourri to assuage my thirst.  Go,
Amelia, and make speed to do my bidding."
</p>

<p>
And Amelia, with bulging eyes, has gone.  I could
hear her muttering to the landing furniture, "Just
a bit dotty in the head like Ned Wemp, the village
softy.  Poor thing, no wonder she's queer at times.
She <i>did</i> bump her head."
</p>

<p>
And I am laughing weakly.  I feel, after all,
unequal to tackling the encyclopædia.  I feel faint
with waiting and watching for Dr. Renton.  It is
half-past three.  I heard nurse come in a few
minutes ago.  I hear Amelia rattling the tea-cups.
But the sound doesn't cheer me.  Somehow, why I
cannot say, fear has gripped me at the heart.  And
I cannot laugh it away.  Why is Dr. Renton so
long in coming?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'He cometh not,' she said;<br />
  She said, 'I am aweary, aweary,<br />
  I would that I were dead!'"<br />
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Dr. Renton has been here.  And I have sent nurse
away so that I may fight it out alone before Dimbie
comes home.  I broke down a little before
Dr. Renton, but I mustn't cry before Dimbie.  I must
always try to remember that.  He has quite enough
worries of his own.  I must never cry before
Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Renton's words keep slowly repeating
themselves in my brain: "To lie for twelve months is
hard, but&mdash;supposing it had been life-long
crippledom, that would be harder."
</p>

<p>
"Supposing it had been life-long crippledom!"
</p>

<p>
I must go on saying it over and over again till
I feel patient, till I feel grateful for only being asked
to bear the lighter burden.  But, oh, how long it
seems!  How very long!  To think that I must lie
quite still.  And this was to have been my first year of
happiness, the first year in which I was free to roam
at my will, free to stretch my wings away from
Peter's cramping influence.
</p>

<p>
It seems a little hard.
</p>

<p>
"But supposing it had been life-long crippledom!"
I must learn to be patient.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
I think I might have helped Dr. Renton, made it
less difficult for him to tell.  But I was selfish.
Instinctively I knew what was coming&mdash;his rugged
face was more rugged than usual&mdash;and yet I
clasped my hands and cried, "How long you have
been.  When may I get up?  Oh, say to-day.  I
<i>do</i> so want to go to the door to meet Dimbie.  I ache
to go and meet him.  I hear the latch of the garden
gate, his footstep on the gravel; then my spirit like
a bird flies to meet his, and&mdash;Amelia meets him.
Speak, Dr. Renton.  Say it quickly.  Say I may
get up."
</p>

<p>
And all the answer he made was to pick up one
of the volumes of the encyclopædia and walk to the
window.
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a moment, and that silence
told me all.
</p>

<p>
"But my pulse is steady, doctor, dear," I cried
with a sob in my voice.  "My temperature is normal.
My eyes are clear.  My colour is good.  I am <i>quite</i>
well again."
</p>

<p>
"I wish to God you were!" he said almost savagely.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter with me?"  I spoke more
quietly.  His evident emotion frightened me into a
momentary calmness.  I might as well know the
worst or best and get it over.  My heart beat thickly,
and I closed my eyes.  I had known Dr. Renton
long enough to feel sure that whatever he told me
would be the truth.  And the truth was that I was
to be on my back for a whole year; to be lifted from
my bed to a couch, and from the couch back again
to bed; that I might be wheeled from one room to
another on the ground floor, but must never walk.
</p>

<p>
Never walk!  As one in a dream I heard his words.
Dully and with unseeing eyes I stared through the
window.  By and by I should get used to the idea,
used to being still.  <i>What would Dimbie say</i>?
</p>

<p>
I turned to the doctor quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Does my husband know?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Why haven't you told him?"
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to make sure."
</p>

<p>
"And you are sure now?  There is no other
way&mdash;treatment, massage?"  I spoke breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"There is no other way.  But a year will pass
quickly.  You must be brave."
</p>

<p>
"But I didn't want it to pass quickly," I cried
bitterly.  "Don't you understand this was to have
been my year&mdash;my wonderful year?"
</p>

<p>
"There will be other years," he began gently.
"You are young, Marguerite.  All your life is
before you.  There will be next year&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But next year will not be the same as this.  Go,
Doctor Renton; leave me.  I am going to cry,
and you will be angry.  You hate tears.  But I
must cry before Dimbie comes home, and the
time is passing.  Unless I cry I&mdash;I shall break in
two."
</p>

<p>
The tears were raining down my face as I spoke,
and Dr. Renton swore lustily, as he has always done
when upset.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," I said, smiling through my tears.
"Your language will deprave Jumbles."
</p>

<p>
He held my hand between his.
</p>

<p>
"You know I am sorry.  I am a poor hand at
expressing what I feel."
</p>

<p>
"I know," I replied.  "No girl ever had a kinder
doctor."
</p>

<p>
"I shook you when you were a little girl with
measles for running barefoot about the passages."  He
was patting my hand.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean you want to shake me now?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if you cry any more," he said a little grimly,
but the expression in his eyes was very kind.
</p>

<p>
"I'll try not to," I whispered tremulously.
</p>

<p>
"That's a brave girl," he said.  "Good-bye,
keep up your heart, and we'll get you well."  And I
lay and cried for half an hour.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<h4>
DIMBIE COMFORTS ME
</h4>

<p>
Dimbie went very white when I told him.  He
walked to the window and stared for some
time at the gathering darkness.  I had chosen this
hour, knowing my face would be in shadow.  It
is so much easier to control one's voice than one's
features.  Jumbles rubbed his face against my
shoulder.  I could hear Amelia singing, "Her golden
hair is hanging down her back."  She sounded
cheerful and happy.  Nurse had gone to the village
to post a letter.  She would be back soon to "settle"
me for the night.  Why didn't Dimbie speak&mdash;say
something?  I wanted to be comforted as only
Dimbie could comfort me.
</p>

<p>
A little sigh broke from me, and in a second his
arms were round me and I was held very closely.
</p>

<p>
"My poor little girl," he murmured.  "I <i>am</i>
sorry for her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dimbie," I whispered, clinging to him,
"can you bear with me if I have a little grumble?
I meant to be so brave to you, to put on such a
bright face, not to let you hear <i>one</i> word of
repining; but I want to let it all out, oh, so badly.  You
only can understand how I feel, because you know
and love me best.  And after to-night I will try
never to speak of it again."
</p>

<p>
For answer he pillowed my head on his shoulder
and kissed my eyes and hair and lips.
</p>

<p>
"You see," I said, looking across the garden,
which was shadowy and mysterious, to the frog-pond
field, "I don't think I should have felt it quite
so much if it had been next year.  We should have
been an old married couple by then, and have got
used to everything&mdash;to all the wonderfulness of
being together alone, I mean without mother and
Peter."
</p>

<p>
"I shall never get used to that," said Dimbie with
emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you will," and I assumed an old married
woman's air.  "It seems incredible now, when we
have been husband and wife for only five months.
How do you feel when you say, 'My wife'?"
</p>

<p>
"Thrill all over."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," I laughed, "when I say, 'My husband.'  I
feel quite shy, and imagine people must be laughing
at me.  But&mdash;have you ever seen Peter getting
excited over those two words, 'My wife'?"
</p>

<p>
"Never," said Dimbie.  "But," indignantly, "you
are not surely going to compare me with Peter?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not going to compare you with anyone.
But just think of all the couples you know
who have been married, say&mdash;longer than two years."
</p>

<p>
"Shan't."
</p>

<p>
I laughed and kissed his ear.  Then I became grave.
</p>

<p>
"Now listen to my words of wisdom.  I am going
to speak for some time, tell you all my thoughts, and
you mustn't interrupt.  You and I love each other
very much, and we are always going to love each
other very much&mdash;at least we hope so.  But this
would have been our one wonderful year.  This
would have been the year when we should have
walked upon the heights very close to the sun and
stars.  This would have been our year of
enchantment, when the weeds on the wayside would have
blossomed as the rose, and the twitter of every
common sparrow would have been to us as the
liquid note of the nightingale.  This would have
been the year when we should have wandered down
dewy lanes, and, looking into each other's eyes, would
have found a something there which would have
caused our hearts to swell and our pulses to beat.
</p>

<p>
"On June evenings we should have gathered little
wild roses and plunged our faces into fragrant
meadow-sweet, and laughed at the croaking of the
frogs in the pond and had supper in the garden
under the apple tree, loth to leave the sweetness of
a summer night.  In July we should have sat in the
bay or gathered moon daisies; and I, forgetting I
was Marguerite married, would have whispered, 'He
loves me, he loves me not;' and you, flinging down,
your hat on to the grass, would have knelt in front
of me and behaved in a manner most foolish and yet
most delightful.  In August we should have had our
first holiday together.  What scanning of maps and
reading of guide-books!  Cromer, we would
settle&mdash;poppy land.  We would laze on the heather at
Pretty Corner and look at the blue sea.  Too many
people we would remember, and fix on the Austrian
Tyrol.  Baedekers would be bought, trains looked
up, only to find that when we had paid Amelia's
wages and the poor rate our bank balance was very
small.  And finally we should have found our way
to some old-world Cornish fishing village, where we
should have bathed and walked, and fished from an
old boat.  In September we should have cycled
along beautiful autumn-scented lanes, dismounting
at Oxshott, and wading ankle-deep through the pine
woods, would have silently thanked Cod for the
flaming beauty of the birches silhouetted against the
quiet sky.  In November we should have tidied up
our garden and planted our bulbs for the spring&mdash;crocuses
and daffodils, especially daffodils, for do
we not love them best of all the spring flowers?
And then Xmas would have come, with its merry-making
and festivities, and our beautiful year would
have ended on a night when with clasped hands and
full hearts we should have listened to the tolling of
the bell for its passing&mdash;the dear, kind old year
which had brought us such joy, such complete
contentment."
</p>

<p>
I finished with a break in my voice, and, forgetting
all my brave resolutions, two big tears dropped on
to Dimbie's hand which held my own.
</p>

<p>
"Poor little sweetheart!  My own dear wife," he
said, "I am sorry for you, so sorry I cannot express
it.  But why shouldn't such a year as you picture be
ours when you are strong and well once more?
This first year of our marriage shall be an indoor
year.  You shall be Marguerite-sit-by-the-fire,
knitting and making fine embroidery, and later on you
shall be my Marguerite of the fresh air, of the sun and
the wind, and we will still have our wonderful year."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"It could never be the same," I replied.  "I may
sound sentimental, Dimbie, but I am a woman and
know.  Men are very ignorant about love, only
women know.  Men imagine that romance will last
beyond the first year as well as love, but women
know better.  Besides, men don't care about its
lasting, it tires them, bores them; but women care,
oh, so much.  They can't help it, they are born
that way.  Men are tremendously keen on gaining
the object of their affection, and when they have got
it they regard it calmly, affectionately, unemotionally.
It is a possession: they are glad for it to be there,
and almost annoyed when it is absent&mdash;not exactly
because they miss the possession's companionship,
but it has no right to be anywhere but at its own
fireside.  Men go to golf, tennis, race meetings,
fishing on their Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
They are quite surprised at the possession being a
little sorry and hurt at first at their not wanting to
go about with her as they did in that first wonderful
year.  The possession is unreasonable, exacting; she
wants to tie her husband to her apron strings.  She
has no right to be lonely&mdash;there are the children,
and if there are no children she must make interests
of her own; or&mdash;she might even take to golf so
long as she isn't extravagant and ambitious, and
expect to play with Haskells or her own husband.
</p>

<p>
"All these are platitudes, you will say; but there
never were truer platitudes.  Ah, if husbands would
only realise and accept the fact that woman is the
other half of man, but diverse, how much happiness
there would be.  Diverse!  He loved her for her
feminine attributes before marriage&mdash;for her
weaknesses if you like to call them such.  Why doesn't
he after?  A true, good woman doesn't want a great
deal.  A gentle word, a caress, a look of love and
understanding from the man she loves are far more
to her than coronets.  A woman likes to be wanted,
and I don't think it is vanity.  Watch her smile
if her husband marks her out of a large crowd for a
little attention.  The other women there may be
young and beautiful; she is little and old and faded,
and wears a shabby gown&mdash;but her husband <i>wants</i>
her.  Women are never happier than when they are
wanted.  And how quick they are, how instantly
they divine when an act of courtesy is performed for
them from duty only and not from affection.  I
once heard a man curse when his wife asked him to
hold her umbrella on a wet night when she was
struggling with the train of her gown and her slippers.
They were dining out, and couldn't afford cabs.
She was frail, and he was big and strong.  She just
caught at her breath.  Through the years she had
learnt wisdom, a greater wisdom than Solomon could
ever teach.  She realised that this man would stand
by her in a tight place, and with that she must be
content.  It was unreasonable of her to hanker after
the little words of love and kindness which make life
so sweet.  He was faithful to her, he didn't drink or
gamble or go to clubs.  He gave her £25 a year for
her clothes, and he 'kept' her.  What more could
she possibly want?  And if he swore at her, and
told her she looked old, and why couldn't she dress
like other women, it was only his little way, and
didn't mean anything."
</p>

<p>
I paused.
</p>

<p>
"And so, and so that is why I am grieved at the
loss of our first year."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie sat in silence for a moment, and when
he moved and gently placed my head on the pillow
I was startled by the expression of his face.
</p>

<p>
"You speak from your experience of the manner
in which your father has treated your mother," he
said at length slowly, "and that is a little hard on
other men.  Do you think I shall ever cease to want
you, Marguerite?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you do."  His voice was stern.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot answer for the future."
</p>

<p>
"You have no faith in me?"
</p>

<p>
"You see, I shall be a helpless log, a useless
invalid for twelve months or even longer," I said.
"It will be a great strain on your love."
</p>

<p>
He dropped my hand and made to go away.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go," I cried.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think my love would stand the test of
your being an invalid for even twenty years?"
</p>

<p>
I did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"Do you?" he said, dropping on to his knees and
looking into my eyes.  "Do you, Marguerite, wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for that!" he said.  "I was beginning
to think&mdash;I was afraid you did not understand
me; that you were fearful at having given yourself
to me; that you did not love me, in fact, as I love
you, for where there is love there is no fear."  He
laid his cheek to mine, murmuring, "Marguerite!
Marguerite!" and so we sat till the darkness fell
and nurse came in.

CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<h4>
AMELIA EXPRESSES HER OPINION OF ME
</h4>

<p>
And so I have settled down to my year of
inactivity, of schooling my temper, of a
constant looking for and waiting for Dimbie, and of a
perpetual wrestling with Amelia.
</p>

<p>
When I told the last-named of my misfortune she
just stood and stared at me.  I thought she could
not have understood, or surely there would be a
word of sympathy.  She was kind at heart I knew.
</p>

<p>
"Twelve whole months on my back," I repeated
plaintively.
</p>

<p>
"And never have a bath, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly," I said irritably.  "Of course
arrangements will be made for my baths.  And all
the rooms are to be rearranged.  The doctor wishes
me to be carried downstairs.  The dining-room is to
be turned into my bedroom, then I can be wheeled
across to the drawing-room each day; and the
smoke-room will be used for meals.
</p>

<p>
"The smoke-room is full of bicycles and
photographic rubbish," she said argumentatively.
</p>

<p>
"Well, they can be moved.  Don't throw
stumbling-blocks in the way of every suggestion.  Are you
not sorry for me?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Very, mum," she assured me with warmth.  "I
knows how you will take on.  No one is never
satisfied with anythink in this world.  Now here,
I would give my very heyes to be a grand lady
reclinin' on a couch in a beautiful tea-gown,
readin' novels, and drinkin' egg and sherry twice
a day."
</p>

<p>
"You would get very tired of it," I sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'll have to have a settled hoccupation,
mum&mdash;makin' wool mats like the work'us people,
though I must say as they don't like it.  My uncle
says they used to be quite peaceful and happy till
them Brabazon ladies came along and taught 'em
how to make wool mats and rush baskets.  They
worried about the patterns of them mats till the old
men was drove fairly silly.  P'r'aps you could write
poetry.  You has a bit of a look sometimes of a
person&mdash;I mean a lady who <i>could</i> write poetry.
There was a poet as visited Tompkinses'&mdash;a
sickly-looking gent with hair like a door-mat and a
complexion like leeks which has been boiled without
soda.  Tompkinses was very proud of knowing
him, and the heldest Miss Tompkins used to wear
her canary-coloured satin blouse when he came to
dinner.  When the wine was offered him he always
said, 'No, thanks,' in a habstracted way, but when
it went round the table again, as wine does, he'd
fill a tumbler, and frown at the ceiling, and pretend
he didn't know what he was doing."
</p>

<p>
"And do I look like a leek that has been boiled
without soda?" I asked faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, mum," Amelia replied with comforting
haste, "not quite so bad yet.  You've looked more
like a love-lies-bleeding just lately since you had
your accident&mdash;though the master seems satisfied.
Everybody's tastes is different.  Love-lies-bleeding
is not my fancy.  I like something handsome and
straight up like a sunflower or pee-ony.  Writin'
poetry would help to pass the time, and you has
some of the tricks this poet had.  He'd stand and
stare at the moon, when he was in the garden with
Miss Tompkins, and mutter to it like someone gone
daft.  He fairly skeered me; and he'd take on at
catchin' sight of a vi'let as though he'd met a
cockroach."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" I asked, trying to see the connection.
</p>

<p>
"Well, mum, I catched you carryin' on in just the
same way in the garden on master's birthday.  You
was starin' up at the sky at a lark&mdash;I was going to
the ashpit&mdash;and I heard you say softly to yourself,
'Bird, thou never wert.'  I couldn't help hearing
you, and I wondered whether you thought it was a
kitten or a spider."
</p>

<p>
I laughed, though I didn't want to do so.  I was
hideously depressed at the thought of that glorious
spring morning and now&mdash;but Amelia was so very
ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
I watched her dusting, which was vigorous and
thorough, and wished she would put Ruth, a picture
above the mantelshelf, at a more decorous angle.
</p>

<p>
"I have been thinking that you won't be able to
manage the housework alone without my assistance,
Amelia," I observed, when she had finished
brandishing the duster about and had stopped squeaking.
"We shall have to engage a charwoman to help you
a couple of days a week.  We can't afford another
servant, I am sorry, but a charwoman will be very
helpful.  Then if I sent all the washing out I think
you could manage.  Oh, and I will have a window
cleaner," I added encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
I thought she would be pleased.  I imagined
servants loved charwomen.  I know I should were
I a servant&mdash;so nice to have someone to talk to,
and into whose willing ear to pour tales about the
mistress.  But Amelia snorted so violently she made
me jump.
</p>

<p>
"Charwoman!"  It would be difficult to convey
the scorn in her voice.  "Charwoman helpful?"
</p>

<p>
"Aren't they?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
Amelia flung herself towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"You'd never seen a flue-brush, mum, and now
you asks if a charwoman is helpful."
</p>

<p>
I remained silent, overwhelmed by my own ignorance.
</p>

<p>
Amelia fetched a piece of wet, soapy flannel, and
applied it to some of her own finger-marks on the
white door.  I felt glad she was working off her
feelings in this way.
</p>

<p>
"What do they go out for?" I said at length.
</p>

<p>
"Just to rob the silly folks who engages 'em,"
she replied laconically.
</p>

<p>
"Are they all like that?"
</p>

<p>
"Everyone as I met.  It took me best part of a
day to clean up after her as came to Tompkinses'.  She
swilled herself in beer and tea, had meat three
times a day, and hung tea and butter round her
waist under her skirt just like a bustle when she
went away in the evening."
</p>

<p>
"But surely she was an exception?" I commented.
</p>

<p>
"No, mum, they're all like that, every one of
'em," she replied firmly.
</p>

<p>
"But how are you going to manage now I am laid up?"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated for a moment, perhaps out of
consideration for my feelings, but her own got the
better of her.
</p>

<p>
"I shall manage all right," said she briskly.  "In
fact, I shall get along much better.  Your helping
hindered me terribly, mum.  I hope as I'm not
hurtin' your feelin's.  You see," she added kindly,
"you 'adn't been used to work, not with four
servants; and when you did anythink I always had to
be runnin' after you to wipe up the mess.  You
said you'd fill the lamps; well, you did when you
wasn't putting the paraffin on the table&mdash;there
was that to scrub, and your gloves and scissors to
put away.  And the day as you said you'd make a
puddin', well&mdash;the sultanas was lying about like
blackbeetles, mum, and flour all over the place just
like a snowstorm.  And it was, 'Amelia, put the
pan on, please,' and 'Amelia, take it off,' and
'Amelia, put some coal on the fire, the puddin'
water's stopped boilin',' and 'Amelia, the puddin's
boiled dry.'"
</p>

<p>
She stopped for breath, and I looked drearily
through the window.
</p>

<p>
"Hope you're not offended, mum, but I wanted
you to hunderstand as how I could manage all
right."
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand," I replied.  "No, I am not
offended.  I am afraid I am not of much use in
the world, Amelia," and I sighed.
</p>

<p>
"But the master doesn't seem to want you any
different, mum," she said comfortingly.  "He sits
and looks at you as though you had won a prize
at a show.  Mr. Tompkins used to stare at his
black prize Minorca just in the same hidentical way."
</p>

<p>
"His black Minorca?" I repeated vaguely.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mum.  One of his hens as got a first prize,
and was a rare layer."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"I must go now," she said, "and put the potatoes
on for your lunch.  And don't you fret about the
work, mum.  As soon as ever nurse has gone, who
makes a power of mess, I shall have plenty of time
and to spare, and can put a patch on my pink body."
</p>

<p>
"What, another?" I almost shouted.  "That will
make the seventh."
</p>

<p>
She regarded me with uplifted brows.
</p>

<p>
"You don't want the bones of my stays to come
through, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," I assured her quickly.  "But is it
necessary to have quite so many bones?  I have
only about six altogether."
</p>

<p>
She looked me up and down with an eye devoid
of any admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I don't wear corsets at all now," I
hastened to explain.
</p>

<p>
"My figger has always been my strong point,
mum, and I'm not goin' to let myself go.  Of course,
you're thin, mum, so it doesn't matter so much.
But people who lets themselves go always has big
waists, like the statues in picture galleries.  I once
went to a show in Whitechapel, and I says to the
girl who went along with me 'I'd be downright
ashamed if I couldn't show a smaller waist than
that Venus.'  I expect yours will be pretty big when
you gets about again," with which comforting
prediction she retired to the lower regions and left me
with this pleasing prospect and my own thoughts,
which were not of the most cheerful description.
It is hard to be told that one is of no use in the
world, and to be compared with a black prize
Minorca, however good a layer!

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<h4>
I DISCOVER THAT DR. RENTON IS IN LOVE
</h4>

<p>
Nurse has gone, and I am not overwhelmed
with grief.  I could quite see that within
another week the kitchen would have been turned
into a pugilistic ring, and she and Amelia would
have settled their grievances in a fight.
</p>

<p>
Amelia has said, with her nose in the air, "Seems
to think I am just here to wait on her, mum.  Nurses
halways imagines they're duchesses, and just took
to nursin' out of pilanthropy."
</p>

<p>
And nurse has said kindly, "I don't want to worry
you, Mrs. Westover, but probably <i>that</i> girl is here
just as a temporary, or I shouldn't speak; but really
her impertinence is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She is <i>quite</i> permanent," I have hastened to
assure her, at which she too has stuck her nose in
the air; and so they have gone about as though the
law of gravitation was reversed, and their noses
permanently drawn heavenwards.
</p>

<p>
I am downstairs in the drawing-room.  I found
awaiting me an invalid couch&mdash;an Ilkley&mdash;low
and luxurious, with soft down cushions cased in silk
of a lovely golden hue&mdash;a couch contrived to ease
the weariness of tired people.  They have pushed it
into the window, and from here I can see all my
friends of the garden&mdash;the apple tree best loved of
all, for is it not our very <i>own</i> tree, growing on our
domain?  One has a peculiar affection for one's own
possessions.  Not that I am anything but grateful to
the beech in the frog-pond field for casting its cool
shadow across the lawn; but it belongs to somebody
else&mdash;perhaps some farmer who hardly knows of its
existence.
</p>

<p>
My descent from the upper regions was somewhat
perilous.  We&mdash;Amelia, nurse, and I&mdash;wanted to
take Dimbie by surprise, so nurse said she would
superintend my removal.  As a matter of fact, she
did nothing of the kind, for Amelia superintended it.
</p>

<p>
First of all she made me put up my hair.  She
said I could not "boss the show" with it hanging
down in two plaits.  I reflected that were I to dress
it as high as the Eiffel Tower I should not be able to
boss <i>her</i>, but I did not mention this.  Next she
picked up <i>her</i> end of the chair and fairly ran with
me down the stairs, nurse being bound to follow.
I closed my eyes and held my breath, and when I
opened them again I found myself staring at two
gorgeous yellow flags decorated with portraits of
the King and Queen.  They had certainly not been
there on the last occasion of my being in the
drawing-room.  The King wore a top-hat and carelessly
held a cigar in his kid-gloved hand.  The Queen,
poor thing, was extremely <i>decolletée</i>, and wore mauve
roses in her hair.  The King, in morning dress,
seemed out of place to me by the side of such
grandeur on the part of his spouse.
</p>

<p>
Amelia broke into my musings.
</p>

<p>
"Thought we would have a bit of decoration,
like the Jubilee, mum, in your honour, so I got
them flags in the village."
</p>

<p>
She looked at me expectantly, and nurse sniffed.
</p>

<p>
The sniff annoyed me.
</p>

<p>
"It was extremely kind of you, Amelia," I said
warmly.  "Thank you very much."
</p>

<p>
"And the Hilkley, mum?  The master got that,
and we smuggled it into the house without your
hearing anythink that was going on.  And he's been
wheeling it about hever since, trying to get the best
persition, where the sun wouldn't catch your eyes,
and where you could see the garden and the happle
tree."
</p>

<p>
"I think it is lovely.  Please lift me on to it,
nurse.  <i>You</i> will have to lift me to-morrow, Amelia,"
I said soothingly.
</p>

<p>
She watched the proceeding carefully, and with
gentle hand arranged the cushions.  The hand was
rough and coarsened by hard work, but I felt that it
would ever be ready to do my service.
</p>

<p>
I told them to leave me, as I wanted to be alone.
I wanted to think.  Now that I was downstairs I
wished to review my position.  The familiar aspect
of the room, the furniture&mdash;which Amelia had
pushed against the walls with an undesirable effort
at neatness&mdash;conjured up a thousand pleasant
memories.  It had been on a snowy winter afternoon
when Dimbie and I had first come home.  How
peaceful, how delicious the warm, fire-lit room had
seemed after the rush of hotel life!  We sat in the
gloaming talking, planning out our lives, what we
would do, where we would go; and now&mdash;ah! when
should I cease to chafe at lying still?  I thought of
all the people who had had to lie so much&mdash;Mrs. Browning,
Stevenson, and they had seemed so
patient over years of ill-health&mdash;and my inactivity
was but for one year, and yet I was not patient.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Doctor Renton came into the room, bearing in
his arms a great bunch of roses.
</p>

<p>
"From your mother," he said; "she came round
with them this morning.  She wanted to come with me."
</p>

<p>
"And why didn't she?"  I felt my eyes kindle.
</p>

<p>
"You know," he replied with a shrug.
</p>

<p>
"Peter is a beast!" I said.
</p>

<p>
He smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You are evidently better.  I am glad to find you
downstairs.  How did you manage the removal?"
</p>

<p>
I described it fully, and he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"That girl of yours is a brick.  I should keep her."
</p>

<p>
"She wouldn't go," I said.
</p>

<p>
"She will help you not to be lonely.  Have you
made any friends here yet?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I returned.  "I believe some people called
when I was ill.  But I don't want anybody."
</p>

<p>
"You only want your husband?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You seem uncommonly fond of one another."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," I said.
</p>

<p>
To my surprise he sighed and walked to the
window.  I noticed his figure was a little bent and
his hair grey.  I had known Dr. Renton all my life,
but for the first time it came to me that he was
lonely.
</p>

<p>
"Why have you never married?" I asked
suddenly.  He surely wanted a wife.
</p>

<p>
He started, and then smiled.
</p>

<p>
"All young married people want to know that of
their friends," he said evasively.
</p>

<p>
"I think you would have made an awfully nice
husband, and&mdash;it seems such a pity that you should
be alone."
</p>

<p>
He picked up one of the roses which I had untied
and held it to his face.
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean, a pity?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, that you should be in that great big house
at Dorking by yourself when there are so many
women in the world.  They seem to overflow.  I
don't know what is to be done with them all."
</p>

<p>
"So you want to marry me for the sake of reducing
the number of spinsters?"  He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, not exactly," I replied.  "But I feel you
have lost so much&mdash;you and the woman you ought
to have married."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know there was one?" he asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
I smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I guessed," I said.  "I am quite brilliant at
times.  Where is she?"
</p>

<p>
"In India."
</p>

<p>
He stopped abruptly on the word, and from his
attitude I realised he would have given much to
recall it.  I felt I had been impertinent.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me&mdash;&mdash;" I began.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," he said.  "I don't mind.  It's rather
a relief to speak of it.  You&mdash;you are still in love,
and will understand.  Once there was a time when
I looked forward to being married.  I looked forward
greatly.  I thought of it morning, noon, and night."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" I said gently.
</p>

<p>
"She went abroad."
</p>

<p>
"But why?  Didn't she return your love?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"You don't know?"  I raised my voice.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you tell her?"
</p>

<p>
"You see, she went off so quickly.  She was in
such a deuce of a hurry to get abroad."
</p>

<p>
"What do you call a hurry?"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Renton shuffled.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you knew her for three months?"
</p>

<p>
"I knew her for two years."
</p>

<p>
"And you call two years a hurry?"  I endeavoured
to keep the sarcasm out of my voice.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I didn't know if she cared anything
about me."
</p>

<p>
"Did you expect her to propose to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, certainly not."
</p>

<p>
"I see, you dangled about her for two years.  In
fact, you almost compromised her.  Then you were
astonished at the poor woman running away.  Year
after year you played fast and loose with her&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't call two years year after year," he
interrupted meekly.
</p>

<p>
"I do," I said severely.  "Dimbie was only six weeks."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"We are not all made of the same stuff as Dimbie."  He
spoke so humbly, so unlike his usual decided
self, that I began to feel sorry for him.
</p>

<p>
"And do you think this woman will ever come back?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish to God she would," he said, with an
intensity that startled me.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I do believe you still care for her," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do," he returned with asperity.  "I
thought I mentioned that."
</p>

<p>
"No, you didn't.  You simply said you had
driven a woman to India.  Poor thing, my heart
bleeds for her.  I expect her tears have made a
sort of railway cutting down her cheeks, and she
will be prematurely aged."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Renton grunted.
</p>

<p>
"If you still care for her, may I ask why you
don't follow her, or write to her?"
</p>

<p>
"That is what I have asked myself a thousand
times a day," he cried, walking up and down the
room.  "For years I have been asking myself."
</p>

<p>
"Years!" I said in dismay.  "Is it years?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Then I am afraid you are too late."  I sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am.  I've been a fool.  Now it is
too late."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry."
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"Can nothing be done?" I wondered.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid not, Marguerite."
</p>

<p>
"But you would be so happy married."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think all married people are happy?"
</p>

<p>
"No, according to Nanty few of them are.  But
I think <i>you</i> would have been, and I am sure of
your wife.  You are so strong and kind.  I always
think of you in the same way as I think of Miss Fairbrother."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he said, turning his face away.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
and thirsty land.  You are both such comforting
people.  Do you remember Miss Fairbrother, my
old governess?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, and he walked quickly to the
door and went out.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<h4>
MY FIRST CALLER
</h4>

<p>
Yesterday morning Dimbie said to me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Have any of those beastly women called yet?"
</p>

<p>
"What women?" I asked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Why, the women who live round here, of course.
I suppose there are one or two knocking about?  I
saw a lady with thick ankles and a Wellington nose
come out of the Old Grange."
</p>

<p>
"No, she's not been," I said laughing.  "We've
only been here six months, and we're poor.  If they
came in a hurry it would look as though they
wanted to know us."
</p>

<p>
"And I'm jolly sure we don't want to know them."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie was heated.
</p>

<p>
"Of course we don't, dear; but they won't realise that."
</p>

<p>
"Still, it would be rather nice if somebody dropped
in occasionally to have a chat with you and discuss
Amelia," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to discuss Amelia," I retorted.
</p>

<p>
"I wish Nanty would come a bit oftener."
</p>

<p>
"It is a long way for her to drive.  Why do you
wish to cram the house with women?" I said
plaintively.  "I have quite enough to do with my
reading, mending, sewing, and writing without being
inundated by a lot of strange females."
</p>

<p>
His dear face brightened.
</p>

<p>
"So long as you don't feel lonely and the days
long, that's all right."  He stroked my head the
wrong way.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a bit lonely," I said.  "No one could
be lonely or dull who had an Amelia; and now the
weather is so warm and lovely I lie for hours under
the apple tree.  June herself is more than a
companion.  I think I am going to read; I cut the
magazines, take out a new novel, and then I lie
with eyes half closed looking at the gifts June has
lavished with prodigal hand, listening to the
whisperings of leaves and grass and flowers."
</p>

<p>
"What a patient, plucky little girl," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Patient!" I cried, when he had gone, and the
click of the gate told me another long day had to
be lived through alone.  "Patient!"
</p>

<p>
But how glad I am he doesn't know.
</p>

<p>
The little lazy insects seem so happy to be doing
nothing.  They spread their wings in the warm
sun, and rub their little legs together from sheer
contentment at just being alive.  They regard with
ill-concealed scorn the aggressive busyness of the
bees in the syringa bush, who, like all working
things, are kicking up a tremendous fuss about
their efforts.  "Laziness, doing nothing," the
insects say, "breed peace and contentment."  "But
what about enforced laziness&mdash;lying still on a
couch?" I cry.
</p>

<p>
Oxshott Woods are calling me.  I want to lie
on the warm, scented pine-needles, with the sun
filtering through the branches of the sad, stately
trees on to my face; I want my senses to be lulled
into that beatific repose which only Nature sounds
can achieve.  One thinks that woods&mdash;pine woods&mdash;on
a calm day are still; but lie and listen carefully,
and one will marvel at the multitude of sounds,
at the little hoppings and twitterings, and scurryings
and crawlings and peckings.  You are far too lazy
to turn your head, but you are conscious that little
bright eyes have you well in focus, that a movement
on your part will cause fear and confusion in the
settlement, so&mdash;you don't turn your head.  You
like to know that they are there, and presently you
fall asleep, and who knows what they do then?
</p>

<p>
And I am to miss all this.  The woods may call,
but I must lie still.  The wild-rose hedges may
send messages to me on the soft south wind, invitations
to view their loveliness, but I must refuse them
all.  I must wait for another year.
</p>

<p>
Amelia is anxious to wheel me into the lane.
Dimbie is more anxious, but I say "no."  Who
that is injured is not sensitive?  I dread the
encountering of curious eyes, of eyes that even might be
pitying.
</p>

<p>
I want to be left alone in the garden with the
birds and insects.  They don't allude to my
misfortune, they don't pity me.  They always say the
right thing.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
As though in direct answer to Dimbie's inquiry,
the woman with the thick ankles from the Old
Grange has called.
</p>

<p>
I must have fallen asleep, for I was dreaming
most foolishly and beautifully that Dimbie and I
were in a meadow making daisy-chains, when I
was rudely brought back to my own drawing-room&mdash;Amelia
had wheeled me into the house as the
sun had gone&mdash;by hearing her say, "A lady to see
you, mum."
</p>

<p>
A little irritably&mdash;for I didn't want to leave the
daisy-chains&mdash;I looked round for the lady, but
she wasn't there.
</p>

<p>
"She's on the doorstep, mum.  Will you see her?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," I said.  "You must never leave
people on the doorstep; it is very rude."
</p>

<p>
"What about old clothes women, mum?"
</p>

<p>
I ignored her question, which seemed to me
unusually foolish, and asked her what she meant
by wearing the tea-rose slippers, which I had
expressly forbidden.
</p>

<p>
"Go and change them."  I commanded, "when
you have announced the lady."
</p>

<p>
Her "announcing" was unusual.  "The lady,
mum.  Sit down, please."  At which she pushed a
chair behind my visitor's legs with so much force
that she simply fell on to it.
</p>

<p>
"You must excuse my servant," I said apologetically
when Amelia had vanished.  "She is utterly
untrained but invaluable."  I held out my hand as
I spoke, which the lady touched coldly.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Mrs. Cobbold, and I live at the
Old Grange," she announced with a trumpet note.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course, Amelia forgot to mention it," I
said politely.
</p>

<p>
"She didn't know it."  She was aggrieved now.
</p>

<p>
"She could hardly mention it then," I said
smiling, wishing to cheer her up.  But this simple
and natural comment appeared to have the opposite
effect, for her brow lowered, and the jet butterfly
in her bonnet quivered ominously.
</p>

<p>
"I have called because I heard you were a&mdash;an
invalid, Mrs. Westover&mdash;that you were confined
to your couch."
</p>

<p>
Her deportment dared me to contradict her.
</p>

<p>
"It is very kind of you," I said pacifically.
</p>

<p>
"Not kindness, but duty."
</p>

<p>
"Which makes your effort all the more praise-worthy,"
I said gently.
</p>

<p>
She looked at me sharply&mdash;through her pince-nez
which gripped her nose very tightly&mdash;suspiciously
almost, but she misunderstood me.  I had
not intended to be sarcastic.  I was really touched
at the sacrifice she was evidently making on my
behalf.  I felt she was a district visitor&mdash;probably
the right hand of the vicar of the parish.  She must
need refreshment.  She wore the look of one whose
tongue clove to the roof of her mouth.
</p>

<p>
I rang the tortoise, and requested Amelia to bring tea.
</p>

<p>
"No tea for me, thank you," Mrs. Cobbold
quickly interposed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," I said.  "Perhaps you won't object
to my having a cup?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, but I never take anything between
meals."
</p>

<p>
She seemed quite proud about this.
</p>

<p>
"Really!" I murmured interestedly.  "But tea
is a meal with me."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.  I could hear Amelia
singing, "Now we shan't be long," which meant she
was reaching out the best tea-things.  The best
tea-things appear to uplift her in a curious way.
Perhaps by using them she feels we are gradually
rising to the social status of the Tompkinses, who
had an "at home" day with netted d'oyleys, and
tea handed round by Amelia herself on a silver
salver.
</p>

<p>
I wondered if Mrs. Cobbold could hear her
singing.  I felt sure she would strongly disapprove of
any maid indulging in such vocal flights, and in
spite of myself I laughed.  Our eyes met: hers were
green and hard, and in their depths I discovered
that she disapproved of the mistress more than of
the singing maid.
</p>

<p>
I smiled again&mdash;I couldn't help it; and then I
racked my brain for something interesting and
polite to say.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cobbold forestalled me.
</p>

<p>
"When is it expected? if I may venture to ask you."
</p>

<p>
"In about ten minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Gracious goodness!" she ejaculated, springing
heavily to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever's the matter?" I cried, nearly falling
off the couch.
</p>

<p>
"I thought&mdash;I was led to understand that&mdash;&mdash;"
she stammered and broke off.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" I said, gazing at her in unconcealed
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"That&mdash;that&mdash;you will pardon my mentioning
it, but&mdash;I am a mother myself.  And I was quite
interested in hearing that the population of Pine
Tree Valley was about to be increased.  But I did
not imagine it would be so soon."
</p>

<p>
I lay and stared at her.  She had reseated herself,
and again wore the district visitor air.  Was
she mad or&mdash;suddenly, in a flash, the drift of
her remarks became clear to me.  I strangled a
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"The increase in the population of Pine Tree
Valley has nothing to do with me," I said, a little
coldly.
</p>

<p>
She looked disappointed.
</p>

<p>
"I am suffering from an accident."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said grudgingly.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid you are disappointed."
</p>

<p>
"The vicar's wife has misinformed me."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she has been gifted with a vivid
imagination," I suggested.  "It is unfortunate, as it
might get her into trouble."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cobbold looked or rather glared at me
over the top of her glasses.  I was relieved when
Amelia appeared with tea.  I even forgave her for
her tea-rose slippers, which in her excitement she
had omitted to change.  Casually I inspected the
three-decker bread and butter and cake-stand.  I
felt sure that Amelia would have upheld the honour
and glory of the family by "doing" the thing nicely.
The first plate was beyond reproach, nicely-cut
bread and butter reposing on best netted d'oyley.
Mrs. Cobbold's parlour-maid could have done no
better.  But the second plate made me pause.
What was it?  I rubbed my eyes.  Did I see a lonely
macaroon garnished by a ring of radishes&mdash;pointed
red, fibrous radishes, with long green
tops&mdash;arranged with a mathematical precision, or did I
not?  I leaned forward for a closer inspection&mdash;perhaps
they were chocolate radishes or almond
radishes.  My breath came quickly, and a jet butterfly
smote me on the forehead&mdash;Mrs. Cobbold had
also leaned forward.  The butterfly hurt me.  <i>That</i>
I didn't mind.  What I <i>did</i> object to was
Mrs. Cobbold's impertinent curiosity.  If we chose to
garnish a macaroon with radishes it was none of
her business.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you change your mind and have some
tea?" I said, recovering myself.  "Macaroons
and radishes are <i>so</i> nice together&mdash;a German
tea delicacy."  I nibbled the end of one of the
radishes as I spoke, and found it so hot my eyes
watered.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you," she almost snorted.  "Are you
German?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," I replied, "I am quite English with
just a few foreign tastes."  I covertly dropped the
radish down the side of the couch as I spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Where were you born?"
</p>

<p>
"I was born in Dorking, I mean Westmoreland,"
I said wanderingly.  I was debating as to what had
come over Amelia.
</p>

<p>
"So you are north-country really?"  Her voice
was patronising.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I returned, "isn't it interesting?"
</p>

<p>
She again regarded me with suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"North-country people are becoming quite rare.
Perhaps you have noticed it?  Everybody comes
from the south."
</p>

<p>
She did not speak.
</p>

<p>
"And you," I inquired gently, "are you a native
of Pine Tree Valley?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she replied shortly, "but I have lived here
ever since I was a girl."
</p>

<p>
"So long?" I said thoughtlessly.  And she rose
and offered me her hand, which felt like a
non-committal Bath oliver.
</p>

<p>
"It has been so kind of you to come to see me,"
I said, shaking the biscuit up and down.
</p>

<p>
She unbent a little.
</p>

<p>
"I will try to come again, but won't promise.
My days are so full.  Do you know any of the
people here?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I admitted.
</p>

<p>
"The Honourable Mrs. Parkin-Dervis not called?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
She looked perplexed and annoyed.
</p>

<p>
"But she told me she was coming.  She heard
that you were confined to the house."
</p>

<p>
"She's not been," I said.  "I am sorry.  I
suppose she always leads the way in the question of
calling upon new people.  But you needn't feel you
have committed yourself.  You see, I shan't be able
to return your call, so please don't feel you must
come again unless you want to."
</p>

<p>
"It's not that," she said; "but, you see, my days
are so full."
</p>

<p>
"Of course they are," I agreed warmly.  "I shall
quite understand, Mrs. Cobbold.  I'm so sorry
Amelia is not here to show you out, but were I to
ring the tortoise for ten minutes she wouldn't come.
She is chopping wood&mdash;perhaps you hear her.
Amelia never takes the slightest notice of anybody
when she is chopping wood&mdash;they are Hudson's
Dry Soap boxes&mdash;the more one rings the louder
she chops."
</p>

<p>
"If she were my maid," said Mrs. Cobbold, "I'd
make her&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, you wouldn't," I interrupted.  "You think
you would, but you wouldn't.  We thought the
same when she first came to us, but now we don't.
Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
Through an unfortunate accident the tortoise rang
loudly as I spoke.  I caught my sleeve in its tail,
and it sounded as though I were cheering
Mrs. Cobbold's departure.  She left the house with a
flounce and a flourish.  We may meet again in
another world, but I am certainly not on
Mrs. Cobbold's visiting list in this.
</p>

<p>
When I heard the garden gate bang I rang for
Amelia.
</p>

<p>
"I am never at home to that lady," I said.
</p>

<p>
Amelia stared.
</p>

<p>
"Where will you be, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall be here, of course.  Don't you
understand, I shall not see her."
</p>

<p>
"Am I to say that?"
</p>

<p>
"You're to say, 'Not at home.'"
</p>

<p>
"I can't say that if you are."  Her face was
stolid.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia," I cried, "return to your soap boxes
quickly, or I might fling the tortoise at you."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Go!</i>" I said, and with a loud crack of a bone
she departed, filled with amazement.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<h4>
NANTY CHEERS ME UP
</h4>

<p>
A day has come when it is gusty and wet.
</p>

<p>
Last night the sun, which has been so kind to
us of late, disappeared red and angry, leaving behind
it a sky of flaming glory.
</p>

<p>
I said to Dimbie that perhaps we had not been
sufficiently grateful to his majesty, that we had
begun to take him for granted, and that we should
never make the sun feel cheap.
</p>

<p>
And so to-day the little forget-me-nots and
velvety, sweet-faced pansies have laid their heads on
mother earth, driven there by squalls of angry wind
and rain, and the long branches of the beech tree
in the frog-pond field are waving and bending and
shaking out their wealth of still tender green leaves
with fine abandon.
</p>

<p>
I am solicitous for the sweet-peas.  Dimbie has
been late in putting in the sticks for them to climb
up, and their hold is slight and wavering.  Two
long hedges of Eckfords and Tennants and Burpees,
and that loveliest of all sweet-peas, Countess
Cadogan, flank the lawn on either side.  In a few days
they will all be out, and I shall lie in the midst
of a many-hued, blossoming sweetness.  So much
have I to be thankful for.  A cripple in town would
stare at brick walls, yet to-day only discontent sits
at my side.
</p>

<p>
I am cold&mdash;rain in summer makes the inside of a
creeper-covered cottage very chilly.  The water drips
from the leaves of the clematis&mdash;drips, drips.  I
want to be up and doing.  The rain on my cheek in
the woods and lanes would be gracious and
sweet-scented.  The raindrops lying in the heart of the
honeysuckle would be as nectar for the gods.  But
a rainy world when one is a prisoner within four
walls is truly depressing, and there will be no
Dimbie to-night.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie, dear, do you know how much I miss
you?  The heart of your Marguerite calls for you,
calls for you.
</p>

<p>
You say you will be back soon, but you don't
know.  Little old ladies take a long time to die.
The flame flickers and flares up and flickers and
gutters, and is so long in going out.  What am I
saying?  Dimbie, forgive me, dear.  I don't want
Aunt Letitia to die.  I am praying for her to get
better.  Ill or well, she needs you, or she would not
have sent for you, for her message was: "I know
your wife wants you, but I want you more; and it
will only be for a few days, and then you may return
to her.  I would much like to have seen Marguerite,
but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
What does that "but" mean I wonder?  Does
she know that the journey is nearly over?  And
Dimbie says that that journey has been one of great
loneliness, borne with a great patience and cheerfulness.
I think God will create a separate heaven for
very lonely women.  He will give them little children
and a love that passeth all understanding.  The love
that has been withheld from them in this world
will be given to them a thousandfold in the New
Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
I am always sorry for lonely women.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Nanty came in breezy and fresh and wet, and
my loneliness vanished.
</p>

<p>
"I have told John to put up in the village, and
I can stay with you for a couple of hours," she
announced, removing her cloak.  "And you have
been crying."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there are two tears at the back of your
eyes ready to fall."
</p>

<p>
"Not now," I said.
</p>

<p>
"What's been the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie's away."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!" she said with comical gravity.
"Been away long?"
</p>

<p>
"He went this morning."
</p>

<p>
She laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
"What did you have for lunch?"
</p>

<p>
"Fish."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of fish?'
</p>

<p>
"A whiting."
</p>

<p>
She sniffed.
</p>

<p>
"A cold, thin whiting with its tail in its mouth,
devoid of any taste and depressing in its
appearance?"
</p>

<p>
"That exactly describes it," I said laughingly.
</p>

<p>
"Did you eat it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Amelia is going to make it into a fish pie for
to-morrow's lunch."
</p>

<p>
"Amelia seems to be of an economical turn of mind."
</p>

<p>
"Painfully so," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
Nanty rose and rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
"Bring tea at once, please," she said when Amelia
appeared, "and a lightly-boiled egg for your mistress
with some hot, buttered toast, and light the fire."
</p>

<p>
Amelia's eyes bulged.
</p>

<p>
"We've been doing some summer cleaning, the
fire'll make dirt."
</p>

<p>
"Light the fire at once, please, your mistress is
cold, the dirt is of no importance; her comfort
should be considered before anything else."
</p>

<p>
"But it's summer&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Matches!" said Nanty sternly, and Amelia
produced a box like lightning.
</p>

<p>
Nanty knelt down and removed the fire-screen.
Amelia stood and watched her.
</p>

<p>
"That is not getting tea and toast," said Nanty,
without looking round.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not dressed, mum&mdash;&mdash;" began Amelia argumentatively.
</p>

<p>
"Tea and toast!" thundered Nanty, and Amelia fled.
</p>

<p>
"How brave you are," I said.
</p>

<p>
She laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm certainly not going to be bossed by a young
person like Amelia Cockles.  How does she suit you?"
</p>

<p>
"I've never thought of how she suits us, but I
think we suit her, although we are not grand like
the Tompkinses."
</p>

<p>
"Who are the Tompkinses?" asked Nanty,
settling herself comfortably in an arm-chair.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you remember the people she lived with
before she came to us?  They knew a poet, and
gave dinner parties and had <i>entrées</i> and
<i>hors-d'oeuvres</i>&mdash;hoary doves she calls them."
</p>

<p>
"But does she look after you well?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "so long as I don't interfere with
her cleaning.  She is a great cleaner, that is her
weakest point.  Economy is another; she is too
careful.  Because I told her we were not rich she
seems to think we must live on potato parings.
Then she wears squeaky, high-heeled shoes, a pearl
necklace, and puts on to her print bodies&mdash;as she
calls them&mdash;innumerable patches.  Against these
bad qualities we must set her honesty, early rising,
and devotion to me.  She has taken me in hand
since the day she entered the house.  She thinks,
deep down in her heart, that I am one of the poorest
creatures she has met.  She has compared me on
different occasions to a love-lies-bleeding and a black
prize Minorca hen.  Yet I know she would go
through fire and water for me.  She dresses me in
the morning with a gentleness and patience
unsurpassed by any nurse, and the tenderness with which
she lifts me from the bed to the couch has caused
me to marvel.  You ask me how she suits us.  Now
I come to think about it, I wouldn't be without
Amelia Cockles for the world."
</p>

<p>
She entered as I finished speaking, and placed
the tea-tray in front of me, eyeing Nanty with
undisguised hostility.
</p>

<p>
Nanty returned the look with placidity.
</p>

<p>
"I s'pose you think I have been starving her?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Nanty cheerfully, "I am sure you
would do nothing of the kind.  Your mistress has
just been telling me how good you are to her."
</p>

<p>
Amelia's face softened.
</p>

<p>
"No one could help being good to a lady like
her&mdash;she <i>is</i> a lady," and she flounced out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Nanty smiled.  "You cannot be very dull so
long as that young person is in the house."  She
pushed my couch nearer the fire, broke the top off
my egg, and ordered me to begin to eat.
</p>

<p>
"It is lovely having you here," I said, "I was
just beginning to be dull.  What made you come
this wet day?"
</p>

<p>
"Your husband wired for me."
</p>

<p>
"So you knew he was away?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she returned, "and I went straight away
to see if I could persuade Peter to let your mother
come and stay with you during your husband's
absence."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;&mdash;" I cried.
</p>

<p>
"Your father had just succeeded in getting a
canoe to float on the duck-pond&mdash;personally I
think it was on the bottom, but I did not suggest
that&mdash;and in the flush of victory he said she could
come the day after to-morrow.  Ah, that's better,"
she finished as the blood rushed into my cheeks.
"You looked as white as a ghost when I came in."
</p>

<p>
"You <i>are</i> clever," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she agreed, "in some things."
</p>

<p>
A smile hovered round her mouth.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if you had been Peter's wife&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"God forbid!" she broke in.
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"It will be delightful having mother."
</p>

<p>
"Do you find the days long?"
</p>

<p>
"When it's wet."
</p>

<p>
"Do you still find vent for your happiness in the
pages of a manuscript book?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
She looked at me with incredulous eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You still find your year&mdash;what was it you
called it&mdash;wonderful?"
</p>

<p>
"I have Dimbie."
</p>

<p>
"And an aching back."
</p>

<p>
"That would be worse if I hadn't Dimbie."
</p>

<p>
"No man is worth such love from a woman."
</p>

<p>
"Mine is," I said indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't flash out at me like that.  He must
be an exception."
</p>

<p>
"Of course he is."
</p>

<p>
"And all women think the same when they are
first married."
</p>

<p>
"Nanty, you are a pessimist."
</p>

<p>
"Optimists are tiresome and always boring."
</p>

<p>
"They add to the cheerfulness of the world."
</p>

<p>
"They depress me and always put me in a bad
temper.  You say it is horribly cold, and they
remind you that frost keeps away disease.  You say
it is windy, and they reply that it is bracing.  You
have lost your pet dog, and they suggest that you
might have lost your favourite horse.  People who
always say, 'Never mind, cheer up!' are aggravating
in the extreme.  I like people to weep when I weep
and laugh when I laugh.  I don't like my friends
to make light of my troubles and practically suggest
that I am a coward."
</p>

<p>
She poked the fire with vigour.
</p>

<p>
"So you would like me much better if I were to
howl about my accident."'
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, it would be much more natural and human."
</p>

<p>
"But what about Dimbie?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course if you bring Dimbie into everything
it will be impossible for you to behave in a
rational way."
</p>

<p>
I laughed gently, and Nanty frowned at the fire.
</p>

<p>
"If I were to howl Dimbie's year would be spoiled."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe in wives being unselfish to their
husbands; it spoils them.  Men are quite selfish
enough as it is."
</p>

<p>
"How down upon men you are, Nanty.  Have
you not met any nice ones?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie is not bad as men go.  But give him
a few years; he will be as disagreeable as the rest."
</p>

<p>
"I met a very nice man the other day," I said,
refusing to be annoyed.  "It was just before my
accident&mdash;a Professor Leighrail."
</p>

<p>
"Professor Leighrail!"  A great astonishment
lay in Nanty's eyes.  "A very thin man?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he invited us to look at his ribs.  His wife,
Amabella, is dead."
</p>

<p>
"Amabella dead?" she repeated.
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"He took up ballooning, as he thought it would be
the quickest way of ending himself."
</p>

<p>
Nanty started, and then poured herself out
another cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know him?"
</p>

<p>
"I knew him some years ago."
</p>

<p>
"He once asked you to be his wife."
</p>

<p>
Nanty dropped her spoon with a clatter.
</p>

<p>
"Did he tell you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," I laughed, and hugged Jumbles
who lay on the couch beside me.  "I knew by your
face, Nanty, dear.  Why didn't you accept him?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I was a fool."  She spoke bitterly.
"I should have been happy with that man.  As it
was, he&mdash;grew fond of Amabella.  Didn't he?"  She
turned on me with a pounce.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I think so," I stammered; "but I don't
suppose he ever loved her as much as he loved you.
I should fancy from her name she was a bit&mdash;pussy-catty."
</p>

<p>
Nanty smiled a little grimly.
</p>

<p>
"Men like domestic, sit-by-the-hearth women.
I feel sure Amabella mended his socks regularly
and brushed his clothes."
</p>

<p>
"They wanted brushing the other day," I said
reflectively, "and his boots were miles too big for
him&mdash;they were like canoes."  And I went on to
relate where we had met him, what he had had for
his dinner, and how he was coming to call upon us
in his balloon.
</p>

<p>
"It is a dangerous game," said Nanty crossly as
she rose to go.
</p>

<p>
"But he is lonely and unhappy," I protested.
</p>

<p>
"So are lots of people," she snapped.  "I have
been lonely for twenty years, and I get stouter every
day."
</p>

<p>
"His ribs are like knife blades," I observed.
</p>

<p>
"He was always thin.  I have not seen him since
I was a girl, but I have followed his career.  I knew
he would make a name for himself.  He was always
dabbling in some mess&mdash;ruined his mother's
bed-quilts&mdash;and wore badly-fitting clothes.  It's strange
you should meet him," she finished musingly.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like his address?" I asked quietly.
</p>

<p>
"No, I wouldn't, thanks, but&mdash;I shouldn't mind
meeting him here some day.  It would be pleasant
to have a chat about old times."
</p>

<p>
"Rather dangerous, I should say."
</p>

<p>
"You always were an impertinent child," she
said as she stooped to kiss me.
</p>

<p>
The love affairs of my friends are multiplying, I
thought, when she had gone&mdash;Dr. Renton's and
now Nanty's.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<h4>
UNDER THE APPLE THEE
</h4>

<p>
I am under the apple tree trying to be busy.  In
front of me lies a waif and stray garment&mdash;a
flannel petticoat.  There is no house mending to
do&mdash;everything is new and holeless.  Dimbie had
a trousseau as well as I.  Occasionally he will wear
a small hole in one of his socks, the mending of
which will take me half an hour, then my work is
finished.  So I have taken to waif and stray garments
and deep-sea fishermen's knitting in self-defence.
</p>

<p>
Were I not engaged on this I should be making
wool-work mats like the old men in the workhouse&mdash;I
can see it in the tail of Amelia's eye; so I keep a
garment well to the front, ready to pick up at the
sound of her first footstep, which, being squeaky,
fortunately warns me of the advance of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Now but for Amelia I should be only too content
to laze through the summer&mdash;just staring at the
sky and the soft, white, fleecy clouds through the
breaks in the foliage of the apple tree; for though I
do nothing I am tired, always tired.  Perhaps it is
the warmth of the summer, for the rain and cold
are gone.  By and by I am going to be very energetic,
and do little things for Amelia, whether she
considers it helpful or otherwise.  I shall peel apples
in the autumn when the weather is cooler, and stone
the plums for jam, and skin the mushrooms.  But
now I want to be idle.  I just want to watch the
bird and insect life of the garden.
</p>

<p>
Much to my delight, a colony of ants has settled
at the base of the apple tree.  I get Amelia to wheel
the couch close to their head-quarters, and I lean
over and gently drop little things in front of the
openings to their tunnels.  Sometimes a tiny bit of
twig lies across their front door, or a cherry-stone
bars the cellar entrance; and then what excitement
and confusion reign, what a twinkling of a myriad
tiny legs!  Nine strong, able-bodied men are
requisitioned to tackle the cherry-stone.  I smile and
chuckle as I picture one excited ant&mdash;who is not
eager to tell the news?&mdash;rushing off to inform the
others that he has discovered a thunderbolt lying
at their cellar-door, and they must marshal their
forces for an attack.  And then what a straining and
pushing and levering there is!  First six men arrive;
they look like policemen.  Presently one rushes away
and brings back three more.  They then sort of
take their bearings, trotting in and out of the
front door and eyeing with indignation the obstacle
that lies in their path.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" I cry as they lever the cherry-stone
the fraction of an inch; and Amelia, appearing at
the front door, says&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, mum."
</p>

<p>
Amelia certainly has a most tiresome habit of
cropping up at the tense moments of life.  Should I
call, gently at first, "A-me-li-a," and then louder,
"A-ME-LI-A!" and then in stentorian tones,
"A-ME-LI-A!" finally degenerating into cat-calls
and war-whoops, she wouldn't dream of hearing
me; but when I apostrophise the thrush which comes
to sing in the apple tree of an evening, or encourage
the ants in their labours, or laugh at the ridiculous
wagtails bobbing up and down the lawn, she appears
suddenly and stands and stares at me.
</p>

<p>
Just now I said, "You shouldn't stare at me";
and when she replied, "You're so pretty, mum," I
felt hers was the gentleness of the dove and the
cunning of the serpent combined.
</p>

<p>
I had been trying to persuade her not to whiten
the front-door step, which is of cool grey stone.
She appears to regard it in the same light as a
kitchen-hearth bestowed by a bountiful Providence.
She smears it with wet donkey-stone, and when dry
it gleams and scintillates in the hot sun with dazzling
intensity.  Then she attacks the scraper, which she
polishes with a black-lead brush till it resembles the
kitchen kettle after "siding up."  You cannot
prevent Amelia from "siding up."  Every now and
again she "sides up" me.  She says my hair is
untidy and approaches me with a brush.  She
suggests that the wearing of a pearl necklace round
my throat, the collar of which is cut low for comfort,
would smarten me up.  She picks up my slippers,
which I have kicked on to the grass, and compels
me to put them on in case I have callers.
</p>

<p>
She constantly threatens me with these callers.
She dangles them in front of me when I am idling
with <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>, and offers to bring me
my best hat, as "that Liberty garden thing is shabby
and old-fashioned."  She thinks the vicar may call.
He has been laid up for some weeks; but he is
better, and it is his <i>bounded</i> duty to call to see a
poor sick lady.
</p>

<p>
I gently bring her back to the discussion of the
step, and after some stubbornness on her part she
asks if I would like it done like the Tompkinses'.
Knowing that the Tompkinses are superior people,
indulging in "hoary doves" at their dinner, I say
"Yes" without any further parley, trusting to their
good taste.
</p>

<p>
Mother is coming to-morrow, and I know just
how she is feeling about me.  She will be thinking
if ever her daughter Marguerite wanted her it will
be now&mdash;now, when she is lonely and tired and
without Dimbie.  Her dear face will be brimful of
joy at being wanted by anyone, and at the prospect
of getting away from Peter.  She would not own
up to the last.  If ever there was a loyal, patient
soul in this world it is mother.  She won't allow
herself to believe that Peter is selfish and domineering.
He is her husband, and with a wavering curve
of her sweet lips she pronounces him as just tiresome.
</p>

<p>
And, best of all, I know she will like being here
without Dimbie.  She likes him, she admires him,
but she is secretly jealous of him.  I believe I should
be too if I had a daughter married.  When a child
gives herself into somebody else's keeping the
mother is dethroned; the child&mdash;always a child in
the mother's eyes&mdash;takes her joys and sorrows to
her husband.  He bandages the little cut leg,
figuratively speaking, kisses the crushed fingers, wipes
away the tears of sorrow.  The mother has to take
a back seat, and her heart is sore.  When Dimbie
and I, in the short days of our engagement, would
try to slip away to another room, to be by ourselves,
I have seen mother close her eyes and heard her
give a little gasping sigh.  She would smile bravely
when her eyes caught mine, but I had heard the
sigh, and though my heart ached at the thought of
leaving her alone with Peter, I was unable to keep
the happiness away from my own eyes and voice.
Poor little mother!  It is hard, but it was ever
thus.  You left your mother, and I in turn have
left you.  It is one of Nature's edicts&mdash;cruel it
may seem, but not to be resisted.  Were Dimbie
to call, I should follow him to the end of the world,
I know.
</p>

<p>
But during the days mother is with me I mean to
let her have it all her own way.  I shall pretend
that Dimbie is dethroned.  I shall not talk of him;
at least, I shall try with unusual strength not to
speak of him, beyond mentioning the bare fact that
he is well and ministering to the wants of Aunt
Letitia.
</p>

<p>
And we shall also not talk of Peter more than we
can possibly help.  Long ago we decided that Peter
must be a tabooed subject between us.
</p>

<p>
"We might be led into saying things about your
father which we ought not to say," mother had
implied without putting it into so many words, and
I had nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Besides, he might&mdash;he might have been so much worse."
</p>

<p>
I fear I looked doubtful about this point, for she
added quickly, "He doesn't steal."
</p>

<p>
"No," I admitted, "he is certainly not a thief."
</p>

<p>
"And he doesn't drink."
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"And he doesn't gamble."
</p>

<p>
"No," I conceded somewhat grudgingly.
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;&mdash;" she hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't go off with other men's wives, you
want to say."
</p>

<p>
"That's it.  Your father is&mdash;is quite moral."
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity he is," I said laughing.  "If only
he would run away with someone you could get a
divorce."
</p>

<p>
Dear mother looked terribly shocked, and glanced
fearfully at the door.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," I reassured her; "he's resting in
the library, overcome by your insubordination.  He's
not used to it.  He lunged at me with his stick
because he detected me in a smile, but I dodged him."
</p>

<p>
I remember mother smiled faintly, and told me
I ought not to dodge him.  This conversation took
place after an unusually violent outburst on Peter's
part because he had lost his best gold collar stud,
which he accused mother of having taken.  And
when she tremblingly said that she had never in
her life worn anything around her neck but a lace
tucker, which did not necessitate the wearing of a
gold stud, he said lace tuckers were foolish fripperies,
and that she ought to wear a linen collar the
same as other sensible women.  And when mother
protested that her neck was not long enough, he
replied snappily: "Then stretch it till it is.  You
are a woman without any resources."
</p>

<p>
I smile as I conjure up dear mother's expression
of countenance when he said this.  She usually,
with unquestioning obedience to Biblical commands,
turned her other cheek to him for a smite, but on
this occasion she didn't do anything of the kind.
She simply turned her back on him, drew herself up
to her full height of five feet nothing, and pranced
out of the room.  I say pranced, because she did
prance, just like a thoroughbred horse chafing at the
bearing rein.  Peter watched this prancing with
unconcealed astonishment; in fact, he put up his
monocle and stared at the closed door.  Now if
mother had only pranced a little oftener.  Peter might
have been a much better behaved person.  But
mother is not of the stuff of which people like
Amelia and Napoleon are composed.  She is not a
ruler, and she is not a fighter.  She cannot stand
up for herself, and so Peter has taken advantage of
her sitting position&mdash;which sounds as though I
were referring to a hen, and not to mother at all.
</p>

<p>
I find on turning back the pages that I said
mother was rarely disloyal to Peter, that she
pronounced his selfishness and bad temper as "just
tiresomeness."  Still, the worm <i>will</i> turn sometimes,
and on this occasion she did turn.  To-morrow she
will probably ignore him altogether&mdash;glad to get
away from an unpleasant subject.
</p>

<p>
I am full of delightful anticipations of the peaceful
time she and I will spend together under the apple
tree.  At first she will lean forward when I speak to
her as though she had been deafened by a storm.
To live with Peter is to live in a succession of storms,
and when mother reaches the calmer spaces of the
world she wears an almost dazed expression.  I
must speak very slowly and gently till she becomes
accustomed to being in a quiet haven.  We will chat
in the mornings and doze in the warm afternoons
and discuss Amelia in the evenings.  I know I shall
be unable to resist discussing Amelia with mother.
She will be so interested in her not wearing cloth
boots.  She will be so surprised at my having given
in.  She gives in herself over every question in life,
great or small.  But she is quite surprised if other
people do the same, especially her own daughter.
She imagines I have inherited some of Peter's
characteristics, which Heaven forbid.  She thinks his
bullying is strength of character.  Ah, little mother,
I am not strong, if you only knew it.  I am as
weak as water towards people I love.  You, Dimbie
and Nanty could do anything with me.
</p>

<p>
Amelia has been to tell me that we are out of
Shinio, and shall she run to the village.  She didn't
call it Shinio, but Shiny.  She has quite an
extraordinary affection for the evil-smelling stuff, and is
always "requiring" it.
</p>

<p>
"But you won't be cleaning anything this afternoon,"
I said.  "You are dressed, and it must be
nearly five o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"It's for the brasses to-morrow morning," she
answered in a tired voice, as though she were weary
of explaining things to me.  "It's kitchen-day, and
I do my steels and brasses before breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course," I murmured hastily while looking
for my purse, which I can never find, and which
she unearthed with lightning rapidity from under
the tortoise.
</p>

<p>
I handed her sixpence, but she didn't go.
</p>

<p>
"Anything further?" I asked pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"No, mum; but I was just considerin' if we
couldn't alter your pocket&mdash;put it in front of your
tea-gown, a sort of flap-pocket right-hand side, like
motorists and golfists and cyclists has."
</p>

<p>
"Put a flap-pocket on my right-hand side," I
repeated.  "But I don't motor or golf or cycle."
</p>

<p>
"No, mum, but it might help you not to lose
your purse so frequently, and save you and me a
lot of trouble.  I expect you lies on your pocket
mostly?"
</p>

<p>
"I do nothing of the kind," I replied coldly, "for
I haven't got one."
</p>

<p>
"There!" she said triumphantly, "I might have
knowed it.  I'll fix you one up in two shakes.  I'm
a good hand at sewing.  Have you a bit of white
serge like your gown, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't; and I forbid your putting a
pocket on me anywhere."
</p>

<p>
She looked surprised at my warmth.
</p>

<p>
"All right, mum; I won't if you don't wish it.  I
only thought it would save time.  You see, when
the purse isn't lost the tortis is.  The tortis is a
beggar for gettin' away.  See now, it's slippin' down
the Hilkley at this minute."  She caught it by the
tail and placed it on the little table which always
stands at the side of my couch.  "The creature
might be alive," she finished, shaking her fist at it.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be ridiculous, Amelia," I commanded,
endeavouring not to laugh.  "I will try and not lose
it so often, but things <i>do</i> disappear."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mum, they do," she responded gravely.
"If nothing was ever lost, like hair-pins, the world
wouldn't hold 'em."  With which oracular remark
she swept down the garden path to the gate, her
two heels leaning over at a more dangerous angle
than usual.
</p>

<p>
I drew Dimbie's letter&mdash;he writes every day,
sometimes twice&mdash;from beneath the cushions, and
read it over for&mdash;well, I won't say how many times,
but one passage I already knew off by heart:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dear one, I am glad that you miss me&mdash;very
glad, isn't that cruel?  If you want me, how much
more do I want you, my poor little girl.  I long to
put my arms round you and kiss your big, wistful
eyes&mdash;kiss away the wistfulness, which only came
with your suffering, and I will do it when I come
home.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Letitia is slowly sinking.  She is not
suffering, and her mind is quite clear.  She has asked a
great many questions about you, and has even
laughed feebly at Amelia and her household
arrangements&mdash;I mean <i>your</i> household arrangements.
For the squeaking and cracking of bones and
wearing of unsuitable slippers she has no suggestions to
offer.  She says there is always <i>something</i>.  With
old Ann it has been a misfit in artificial teeth.  They
have moved horribly, and the gums have gaped at
her, but she has not considered this of sufficient
importance to give Ann notice.
</p>

<p>
"I wired to Nanty to know how you were.  You
don't tell me in your letters, bad girl.  I shall scold
and slap you when I get home, as well as kiss you."
</p>

<p>
I glanced carefully round to see that neither
Amelia nor Jumbles were watching me, and holding
the letter to my lips, I kissed it over and over again.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<h4>
MOTHER AND PETER ARRIVE ON A VISIT
</h4>

<p>
I said that mother and I were going to have a
peaceful and happy time together&mdash;that we
should chat in the mornings, doze in the afternoons,
and discuss Amelia in the evenings.  We are doing
none of these things.  We are expending our entire
energies, and mine are very feeble, in soothing Peter
and trying to keep him in a good temper, for Peter
arrived with mother a couple of days ago on a visit
to One Tree Cottage.
</p>

<p>
I <i>will</i> say that it wasn't dear mother's fault.  She
even stooped to equivocation, or, to put it plainly,
lying to keep him away.  She told him that she
didn't know by which train she was coming, when
she knew perfectly well.  She told him our
spare-room bed would only hold one.  Oh, mother!  And
she told him that there had been burglaries in the
neighbourhood of Dorking, and it would be unsafe
to leave the house to servants.  To all of which he
said, "Pooh!"
</p>

<p>
From what I can gather he lay in waiting at the
station like a detective in plain clothes, and
pounced upon mother just as she was saying to
Mary, the parlourmaid, "Good-bye; you will take
great care of the master, and give him kidneys with
his bacon twice a week."
</p>

<p>
"No, she won't," he said sardonically as he limped
into the carriage, "for she won't get the chance.  I
am coming with you, Emma.  I refuse to be left to
the mercy of servants when my gout is so troublesome.
It is most selfish and unreasonable of you
to suggest such a thing.  I am as much to be
considered as Marguerite," at which he planked
himself firmly on to the seat opposite to mother and
glowered at her.
</p>

<p>
At the moment he is seated in the sun with his
feet on Amelia's fair white step, which is now covered
with a sort Of Egyptian hieroglyphic&mdash;<i>à la</i> the
Tompkinses'.  When she wheeled me in the other
evening after a long day in the garden, and I caught
sight of the step, I was filled with a great
amazement, for I was unaware that Amelia understood the
ancient Egyptian language.  A series of curves and
dots, and flourishes and symbolic signs met my
gaze.  I leaned forward and translated with fluency
<img src="images/img-water.jpg" alt="" />&mdash;a water-line,
<img src="images/img-sun.jpg" alt="" />&mdash;the sun,
<img src="images/img-reed.jpg" alt="" />&mdash;a reed,
<img src="images/img-night.jpg" alt="" />&mdash;night,
<img src="images/img-hilly.jpg" alt="" />&mdash;hilly country,
<img src="images/img-egg.jpg" alt="" />&mdash;egg.
Father was a bit of an Egyptologist, and I had picked
up the meaning of a few of the symbols from him:
<img src="images/img-star.jpg" alt="" />&mdash;star,
<img src="images/img-tooth.jpg" alt="" />&mdash;tooth,
<img src="images/img-serpent.jpg" alt="" />&mdash;serpent.
</p>

<p>
Amelia opened her mouth and stared at me, and
then shot me into the house.  It is on such
occasions that she regards me as "dotty," and quickly
puts me to bed.
</p>

<p>
Peter is now scraping his boots on the step after
carefully dirtying them in the gooseberry-bed.
Amelia is hissing at him through the front door;
she objects to her hieroglyphics being defaced.
Peter is not accustomed to being hissed at, and he
will presently come and tell me what he thinks of
Amelia.
</p>

<p>
I persuaded mother a little time back to wheel me
under the apple tree and sit with me.  The grass is
still dew-laden, and Peter will not dare, on account
of his gout, to join us till the lawn is dry, hence his
position on the doorstep.  Peter's gout has been
the one bit of luck in mother's life since she was
married.  Being the more active of the two, she can,
when the pressure becomes very great, walk away
from him&mdash;in fact, run.
</p>

<p>
I cannot help rejoicing at Dimbie's being away
while Peter is here, for I am convinced that long ere
this Dimbie would have thrown my father out of the
house; and for mother's sake I should not care for
such an ignominious thing to happen to her husband.
Besides, he would make such a mess on the step
while he danced about, his customary habit being,
when extra annoyed, to dance a kind of war dance.
</p>

<p>
When he and mother arrived Amelia rushed into
the drawing-room and in great excitement
whispered, "A red-nosed gent has come with your
mother!"
</p>

<p>
In an instant my mind flew to Peter, but I remained
sufficiently controlled to correct Amelia for
saying '"Your mother."
</p>

<p>
"Is she your step, mum?" she murmured cautiously.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not,"' I said.  "But it is not polite.
You must speak of her as Mrs. Macintosh.  Where
have you left them?  Why don't they come in?"
</p>

<p>
"The gentleman is having a row with the cabby.
Don't you hear him?"  She grinned with enjoyment.
"He has just called the cabby a grasping,
white-livered Jew.  It seems as though he knowed how to
take care of himself."
</p>

<p>
I did not speak.
</p>

<p>
"Who is he, mum?"
</p>

<p>
I pretended not to hear.
</p>

<p>
"Is he your uncle?"
</p>

<p>
"He's&mdash;my father."  I closed my eyes, signifying
that the conversation was finished.
</p>

<p>
"Never knew you had a father, mum," came in a
succession of gasps and squeaks.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I have a father," I said excessively
crossly.  "How do you suppose I came into the
world.  Kindly show them in here and go and
unstrap the luggage."
</p>

<p>
When they appeared, and I had embraced them
both, giving mother an extra squeeze, I said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dear father, whatever has been the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"That impudent shark has been trying to rob me,"
he replied, picking up a vase from the mantelshelf
and returning it with a bang.
</p>

<p>
"What did he charge you?"
</p>

<p>
"Two shillings."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that is the right fare, and Dimbie gives an
extra sixpence if he has a portmanteau.  What did
you give him for the luggage?"
</p>

<p>
"A piece of my mind, and threatened him with
the police for his impudence."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father," I cried, "I am sorry you have
made a disturbance.  Up to now we&mdash;Dimbie and
I&mdash;have been respected in the village."
</p>

<p>
"Have you been to church?"  He smiled sardonically.
</p>

<p>
"N&mdash;o."
</p>

<p>
"Who respects you&mdash;the vicar?"
</p>

<p>
"The villagers have a great respect for us.  I&mdash;I
am sure they have."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right.  They'll respect your father
now.  They'll know I'm a man not to be trifled
with.  How are you?"  He shot this last at me as
though he were at Bisley competing for the King's
Prize.
</p>

<p>
"I'm pretty well, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you don't look it.  You're as thin as a rat.
But it's rather improved you than otherwise, made
you look less defiant and assertive."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Peter," mother broke in, "Marguerite never
looked assertive.  I remember Dimbie saying to me
that he had never seen a sweeter face."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, that is exactly the sort of thing
Dumbarton <i>would</i> say," he jeered; "but then Dumbarton's
an ass."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, father," I said steadily, "once and
for all I wish you to remember that I will not allow
you to call my husband an ass.  Yes, <i>allow</i>, I
repeat the word."  I shivered all over as I spoke.
Never, never had I dared to speak to Peter in such
a manner, but my blood was up.  "Dimbie was a
brave man to have married into such a family.  His
courage was immense there."  I clutched the
tortoise as I spoke&mdash;clutched it for support, but I
kept my head well up, looking at him defiantly and
waiting for the storm.
</p>

<p>
But it never burst.  To my everlasting astonishment
Peter remained mute and just stared at me,
stared at me for a full minute, then putting his hands
in his pockets, he said, "Well, well!" and stumped
out of the room.
</p>

<p>
"There!" I said, "that is the way you should
have treated Peter&mdash;<i>always</i>."
</p>

<p>
But mother sat with her hands locked and
remained speechless for some seconds.
</p>

<p>
"How dared you do it?" she breathed at length.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was quite easy," I replied airily.
</p>

<p>
"Was it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps not <i>quite</i> easy," I corrected myself,
"but fairly easy when you once get started."
</p>

<p>
"I never dare start," she said plaintively.  "As
soon as I open my mouth I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shut it again," I said.  "But don't in future,
keep it well open.  Begin to-night, and I'll help you.
Make a firm stand like Horatius."
</p>

<p>
"What did he do?" she asked with interest.
</p>

<p>
"He stood alone and&mdash;and looked after a gate."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I could do that.  If your father were a
gate&mdash;&mdash;" she began eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"What would you do?" inquired Peter, walking
into the room and surveying her from head to foot.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" she stammered.
</p>

<p>
"Don't forget Horatius," I signalled.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I should sit on you!"  With which terrific
exhibition of courage she took to her heels and fled.
</p>

<p>
"I mustn't laugh," I told myself, "or everything
will be spoiled."
</p>

<p>
Peter stood in the middle of the room, staring at
the closed door.
</p>

<p>
"I believe your mother is trying to be funny," he
remarked when he had got his breath.
</p>

<p>
"Mother is often funny," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"I have noticed she has been a bit strange lately."
</p>

<p>
"Oh?"
</p>

<p>
"Very secretive."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?"
</p>

<p>
"In fact, deceitful."
</p>

<p>
"Mother deceitful?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, said she didn't know what train she was
coming by."  He was beginning to raise his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Trains don't always start at the time mentioned
in Bradshaw.  Look at the South Eastern."
</p>

<p>
"This was the South Western," he snapped.  "I
must give her a dose of medicine."
</p>

<p>
"A dose of medicine!" I repeated in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, calomel.  It's her liver, I expect.  She has
been like this before.  How soon will dinner be
ready?"
</p>

<p>
"When Amelia feels inclined to give it to us."
</p>

<p>
"Is Amelia the forward young person with the
pearl necklace who came to the door?"
</p>

<p>
"That is an excellent description of Amelia, but
I thought you had seen her before."
</p>

<p>
"And does she arrange the hour you are to dine?"
</p>

<p>
"She arranges the hour in which the potatoes are
dried, the meat dished, the gravy made, and the
cabbage chopped.  You see, as she does it all, she
naturally knows when it will be ready."
</p>

<p>
"God bless my soul!" he ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"I had no idea you ran your servants in such a
shocking manner."
</p>

<p>
"Servant," I corrected; "and I don't run her,
she runs me."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't have believed it."
</p>

<p>
"You would if you had an Amelia."
</p>

<p>
"I'd sack her."
</p>

<p>
"She wouldn't go if I did."
</p>

<p>
"I'd lock her out."
</p>

<p>
"She'd break a window and climb through it."
</p>

<p>
He began to march about the room.
</p>

<p>
"I'd manage that girl in ten minutes."
</p>

<p>
"She would hold you in the hollow of her hand
in less than five," I said.
</p>

<p>
He spluttered.
</p>

<p>
"What do you take me for?"
</p>

<p>
"I never know.  I've often thought about it," I
said gently.
</p>

<p>
He stopped marching and stared at me.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what mother is doing," I said, averting
my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Your mother," he shouted, rushing towards the
door, "is the slowest woman on God's earth.  She'll
be doing her hair.  <i>I'll</i> bring her down."  And he
went to take out of her what, by right, he should
have taken out of me.
</p>

<p>
"Poor mother!" I sighed.
</p>

<p>
I much fear we are going to have ructions&mdash;Peter
and I.  A strange and tremendous courage has come
to me.  Is it that I know I shall have a staunch ally
in Amelia?  One Amelia is surely worth two Peters.
And yet I don't know.  Peter has been accustomed
to fighting and bloodshed, and managing his men
and out-manoeuvring the enemy most of his life; and
Amelia is only used to managing her mistresses
and charwomen.  As a tactician Amelia may be
weak.  One cannot tell.  I am hoping for the best.

CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<h4>
AMELIA GIVES ME NOTICE
</h4>

<p>
It is said that the young look forward and the
old look backward.  I am still young enough,
I suppose, to live chiefly in the future&mdash;a beautiful
future, with Dimbie ever as the central figure.  But
should I live to be an old woman, and send my
thoughts backward through the years, a smile will
rise to my lips unbidden at the memory of a certain
dinner at which Peter and Amelia played prominent parts.
</p>

<p>
I have to put down my manuscript book for a
moment while I laugh.  Amelia is, I know, watching
me through the pantry window.  She will be
considering that this is one of my "dotty" moments.
For anyone to lie under an apple tree and apparently
laugh at nothing at all is to Amelia a strange and
sad sight.
</p>

<p>
Wait a while, Amelia, you may see stranger things
yet.  Life contains infinite possibilities for those who
have even the smallest sense of humour.  At present
that sense with you is lacking.  Let us hope that it
is not altogether void, but in an embryo stage
waiting for development.
</p>

<p>
To you the dinner last evening was not in the
least amusing.  In fact, the tears you shed later on
were very bitter.  Of course, lookers-on always see
most of the game, and had I been in your place I
admit I should have been very angry; for Peter is
capable of arousing in the human breast passions
which are anything but Christian.
</p>

<p>
Let me relate the story as it sounded to my ears
from the drawing-room.  It is a source of regret
to me that I cannot be present at meals, for the
bicycle-room is not large enough to hold both the
dining-table and my Ilkley couch.  Still, with both
doors set wide apart I can hear most of what is
going on.
</p>

<p>
Peter's voice carried better than Amelia's; he is
used to drilling.  Mother's sounded like punctuation
marks&mdash;notes of exclamation and interrogation,
gentle little apostrophes, and full stops.  But
Peter was not to be stopped.  This is how he began
to annoy Amelia:&mdash;
</p>

<a id="img-158"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-158.jpg" alt="THIS IS HOW HE BEGAN" />
<br />
THIS IS HOW HE BEGAN
</p>

<p>
"What's this?"  A stab of a fork.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't."
</p>

<p>
"Not seen lamb before?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you call this burnt cinder lamb?"
</p>

<p>
Mother, gently, "I think it looks beautifully
cooked, just nicely browned."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you do.  You can eat anything.
Some people have the digestion of an ostrich."
</p>

<p>
Amelia, breaking in, "Please don't carve it that
way, sir.  We eats the bottom side first&mdash;that was
Tompkinses' way&mdash;and next day when it's turned
over it looks as though it had never been touched,
quite respectable like."
</p>

<p>
Peter: "Am <i>I</i> carving this cinder or are you?"
</p>

<p>
Amelia (calmly, but as I knew ominously):
"Neither of us, sir, at this partickler minute.  But
p'r'aps you will be startin' before it's cold."
</p>

<p>
Sounds of splashings of gravy, and hurried exit
of Amelia (I guessed to fetch a cloth).
</p>

<p>
"It's the best table-cloth, sir, double damux, and
has to last a fortnight."
</p>

<p>
"A <i>what</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"A week for dinner, and followin' week for
breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"A piggish habit!"
</p>

<p>
"A what, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"A piggish habit.  Are there no laundries or
washerwomen about here?"
</p>

<p>
"Plenty, sir, but we don't want to over-work
'em.  Will you give me a bit of the knuckle for the
mistress, she likes knuckle.  It's not often she gets
meat for her dinner, only beef and lamb and mutton,
no pork or veal or beefsteak pie.  That's the
knuckle, sir, the other end."
</p>

<p>
Splutterings and drill language from Peter.
</p>

<p>
"And what does she have then?" asked mother.
</p>

<p>
"A whitin', mum, mostly."
</p>

<p>
"She looks like it."
</p>

<p>
"And you'd look like it too, sir, if you was to
lie still, flat on your back, day after day."
</p>

<p>
Arrival of Amelia with my tray.  Confidential
whispering.  The meat will have to be hashed
to-morrow, as it's been carved so disgracefully.  I
cheer her up to the best of my ability.
</p>

<p>
Return of Amelia to dining-room.
</p>

<p>
"What's this vegetable supposed to be&mdash;seakale
or asparagus?"
</p>

<p>
"Neither, sir" (chuckling).  "It's salsify.  Thought
you wouldn't know it, as you don't seem to be up in
the names of things."
</p>

<p>
I bury my face in my serviette and hold on to the
tortoise.
</p>

<p>
"It's like stewed sawdust."
</p>

<p>
"Is it, sir?  The cookery book says it's like
vegetable hoyster."
</p>

<p>
"Vegetable <i>what</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Vegetable <i>hoyster</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand you" (thunderingly).  "Speak
plainly, girl."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what gentlefolks buys off stalls
at the seaside and eats with lemon and cyenne?"  (An
apparent effort to keep calm.)
</p>

<p>
Peter (shouting): "Winkles!"
</p>

<p>
Amelia (with fine scorn): "My friends don't buy
winkles; it's only <i>common</i> folks as does that.  My
friends buy hoysters."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, oy&mdash;sters!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, hoy&mdash;sters."
</p>

<p>
"You can bring in the next course, Angelina."
</p>

<p>
"Amelia, sir.  You're <i>that</i> bad in your
memory&mdash;&mdash;"  Rest of sentence finished in hall and
kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Gentle murmur from mother.
</p>

<p>
"I shall!" (loudly).  "It's a treat to speak to a
girl with a bit of sense, though she is an impudent
hussy, after our sleek-tongued fools&mdash;yes, fools,
every one of them!"
</p>

<p>
Clattering of saucepans in kitchen and stamping
of Amelia across the hall with the pudding.  I could
not remember what I had ord&mdash;suggested in the
way of pudding, and I hoped it would meet with
Peter's approval.
</p>

<p>
"Is this a pudding?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I thought puddings stood up straight?"
</p>

<p>
"Not all of 'em, sir.  Some is a bit weak-kneed
in the joints."
</p>

<p>
Was she poking fun at Peter's gouty legs?
</p>

<p>
"What's inside it?"
</p>

<p>
"Here's a knife and fork, sir.  You'll soon find out."
</p>

<p>
"What's inside it?"
</p>

<p>
"P'r'aps it's a spoon you are wantin' as well."
</p>

<p>
"I don't eat red-currant pudding."
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, sir.  Just keep quiet till the next course, sir.
</p>

<p>
"Keep quiet!"  (Yells.)  "What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"The mistress's nerves gets upset with a bit of
noise."
</p>

<p>
"Your mistress seems to get upset with the slightest
provocation."
</p>

<p>
"She does, sir.  I saw her cryin' not so long ago
over a bunch of honeysuckle.  She was took reg'lar
bad&mdash;red eyes and nose."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course she'll miss gathering it this
year.  The deuce knows why women like picking
things full of d&mdash;ahem! abominable insects.  But
they're born that way&mdash;born stupid."
</p>

<p>
I surprised a gentle note almost in the first part
of his sentence which filled me with wonder.  Was
Peter really sorry for me?
</p>

<p>
And as though he were ashamed of his unwonted
softness his next remark made Amelia skip.  I
could distinctly hear her skip, and it made me
laugh.  Few people can make her run, let alone skip.
</p>

<p>
"This pudding makes me sick, girl.  It smells
of suet, reeks of suet.  Remove it <i>at once</i>!" he
thundered.
</p>

<p>
She stood her ground for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"But the mistress hasn't had any."
</p>

<p>
"Remove that pudding!"
</p>

<p>
"But supposin' Mrs. Macintosh wants another
helpin'" (waveringly).
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Macintosh <i>won't</i> require any more pudding.
Mrs. Macintosh is going to take a liver pill.
Too much pudding would be bad for her."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Take out this pudding!"
</p>

<p>
The windows rattled, and Amelia bolted&mdash;not
into the kitchen but into here, and after planking
the pudding down on to Dimbie's arm-chair, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If you please, mum, I must leave."
</p>

<p>
"Leave?" I echoed in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mum.  I could not stop another minute&mdash;not
for a thousand pounds down&mdash;with that gentle&mdash;I
mean man in the house.  Either he must go or me."
</p>

<p>
Before I could check myself I had smiled, for had
not Amelia called Peter a gentle, the offspring of
a meat-fly&mdash;the horrible creature with which I had
fished as a little girl?  And&mdash;Amelia took instant
offence at my smile.  Not being able to follow my
train of thought, she imagined I was laughing at her.
</p>

<p>
"To-night," she said.
</p>

<p>
"To-night!" I cried, not wishing to echo her
words, but surprise bereft me of an original mode
of speech.
</p>

<p>
"I must leave you to-night."
</p>

<p>
I lay back and looked at Amelia&mdash;at her leaning,
high-heeled shoes, at her pearl necklace, at her
befrilled apron, at her perky cap, at her tightly-curled
fringe.  Could all these things be leaving me
to-night, leaving me forever?  I should miss them, I
knew, so accustomed does one become to familiar
objects.  I wondered where they would go, how
long it would be before Amelia stitched the
right-hand string to her apron instead of pinning it there?
My eyes rose slowly from the apron, upon which
they had been resting, to her necklace.  Whose
gaze, instead of mine, would rest upon those pearls?
Then I reached Amelia's face&mdash;her soap-shone,
eager face.  This brought me to the girl herself.
She, Amelia, who had seemed so devoted, she was
going to leave me&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"To-night!" broke in Amelia sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," I said quickly.
</p>

<p>
She stood and looked at me defiantly.  I don't
know why, for I wasn't speaking.
</p>

<p>
"How soon shall you start?" I asked for want
or something to say.
</p>

<p>
She did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you wouldn't mind giving me a little
pudding before you go," I said.  "It's getting cold.
You put it over there on the chair."  And to my
immense surprise she burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever's the matter?" I asked in consternation.
"Don't cry, Amelia, don't cry."  I patted
the tortoise as Amelia wasn't near enough to pat.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I don't want to go," she sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"No?  Well, don't go," I said soothingly.
</p>

<p>
"But you want me to."
</p>

<p>
"I want you to go?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever makes you think that?"
</p>

<p>
"You didn't say as I wasn't to go when I said I
was, and I would too."
</p>

<p>
This was a little involved, but I disentangled it.
</p>

<p>
"I never thought of saying you were not to go.
You seemed to have so completely made up your mind."
</p>

<p>
"I wish everybody was all like you," she said,
somewhat inconsequently.
</p>

<p>
"All cripples," I laughed.
</p>

<p>
She went on sobbing.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder why you are crying?" I said at length
gently.
</p>

<p>
"Because I don't know where to go at this time
of night.  It's past eight, and the roads are full of
tramps."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't go.  Your bedroom is surely
comfortable.  You've always said how much you like
the pink roses on the wall-paper."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't sleep in the same house as that man
who calls himself a gentleman, beggin' your pardon,
mum.  The same roof shall never cover us again.
And to think he's your father&mdash;you're flesh of his
flesh, bone of his bone."
</p>

<p>
For a moment I wondered whether she would
consent to sleep in the shed with the canoe and
Jumbles if we rigged up a hammock.  Or could I
persuade Peter to return home if I explained how
matters stood?  But on reflection I knew neither of
these things could be.  Amelia was still repeating
"bone of his bone" in an automatic fashion, when
I broke in, "I can't help that, Amelia.  I can't help
his being my father."  Then perhaps I behaved
foolishly, unfilially, for I took her into my confidence.
But what else was I to do?  I am not a diplomatist.
I am not a Talleyrand.  Amelia must be kept at any
price.  The thought of mother and Peter struggling
to light the kitchen fire on the morrow made me
shudder.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia"&mdash;&mdash;I began.
</p>

<p>
She took her apron from her eyes, and I became
nervous.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I would like some pudding, please, however
cold it may be.  And&mdash;and what are they doing in
the other room?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she replied, with a gesture indicating,
as I took it, that she didn't care if they were
descending the bottomless pit.
</p>

<p>
"Shut the door," I breathed.
</p>

<p>
She did so.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia&mdash;&mdash;" I began again.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mum."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> have felt like that."
</p>

<p>
"Like what?"
</p>

<p>
"Like&mdash;that I couldn't sleep in the same house
as Pet&mdash;General Macintosh."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes became round.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have," I repeated.
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head and came closer.
</p>

<p>
"You see, he is a little difficult, a little difficult,
Amelia.  Perhaps his tem&mdash;peculiarity has been
caused by his gout.  He has suffered a great deal.
The servants at home and mother&mdash;well, they all
stay on.  They don't leave.  Do you understand?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded with complete comprehension.
</p>

<p>
I now realised how very clever Amelia was.
</p>

<p>
"I am not well," I went on plaintively, "and
mother isn't very strong and capable, and I don't
quite know what I shall do without you.  I'm&mdash;I'm
afraid I shall die if you leave me.  In fact, I'm
sure I shall die&mdash;&mdash;" and my voice tailed off into a
moan as I finished.
</p>

<p>
Amelia twisted her apron into tight rolls, then
untwisted them, and then leaned on her high heels
towards the couch.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I don't want you to die, mum."
</p>

<p>
"No?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't like it to be said as how I finished
you off."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you wouldn't," I agreed with warmth.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I will stop."  There was an uplifted,
heroic expression on Amelia's face.  "I'll stop.  I'll
never leave you, mum&mdash;not till the breath goes out
of my body, not till I'm a corpse in my coffin, not
even for the butcher's young man, who was only
a-sayin' yesterday as how I had the finest figger he'd
ever come across.  I'll work for you till I drops.
I'll just ignore your father, mum.  Oh, mum, if
everybody was as gentle and perlite and soft spoken
as you I'd die for 'em."  And flinging herself upon
her knees, she wept against the Liberty sofa blanket,
while I surreptitiously stroked her cap, there being
no hair visible to stroke.

CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<h4>
FOREBODINGS
</h4>

<p>
I am very weary.  In the old days, before my
accident, it was my boast that I was never tired.
Perhaps the exertion of conciliating Peter, of trying
to keep the peace between him and Amelia, has
been too much for me these sultry days.  I know
not.  But I do know that I am always tired.  The
sort of tiredness which makes me say, "Go away,
Amelia," when she brings my hot water, and lays
my tea-gown and brush and comb on the bed, and
the long arduous task of being dressed lies before
me.  "Leave me for another hour, please."  And
of course she argues and says the water will go cold;
and I tell her I prefer it so, closing my eyes wearily
to show that the discussion is finished.
</p>

<p>
She surveys me, I know, in surprise.  How can I
be tired when I do absolutely nothing but lie still,
when she is quite fresh after doing the whole work
of the universe?  "Amelia, there is a weariness of
the spirit which is greater than that of the flesh.
You cannot understand this.  A weariness which
leads you to no other desire but that of lying quite
still with your eyes closed, which makes you regard
the simple act of combing out your own hair as
tantamount to one of the Herculean labours.  You
would almost prefer its being tangled to going
through the exertion of getting it straight.  That
you would like to disentangle it for me, I know, but
I shudder at the very thought.  You are kind, but
you don't understand how very tired I am.  I want
to rest a little longer."
</p>

<p>
Even the prospect of being under the apple tree,
in the proximity of my friends the ants, doesn't
tempt me.  The dressing has to be got through
first.  It hurts&mdash;the lifting from the bed to the
couch&mdash;though Amelia is very tender.  It jars&mdash;that
being wheeled from the hall on to the step.  I
want to be without steps and doors, and corners and
turnings and sudden descents.  I want to be on a
gentle, inclined plane&mdash;on a soft, billowy cloud, on
wings of thistledown.  I am tired of my body.  It
is troublesome and aching.  I would gladly have
done with it to-day.  Oh, that I could step out of it
and into a new, whole, strong body&mdash;radiant and
beautiful&mdash;for Dimbie's sake.
</p>

<p>
It is hard that these bodies have to get so tired
before we have done with them.  God sends this
weariness, I suppose, to make the passing easier.  I
am thinking of Aunt Letitia now.  She has gone,
she has done with the world, she knows what is
behind the veil.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie says she just slept herself away.  She was
conscious almost to the last, but was too tired even
to eat a grape.  Then she fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie will be coming home now, but&mdash;not for
four days.  Four days seem a long time in which
to bury a very tired, little, old lady.  What am I
saying?  Am I growing selfish?  "Forgive me,
Aunt Letitia.  I will <i>not</i> grudge Dimbie to you at
the last, when you have done so much for him."  And
the time will pass, for mother and Peter are
still here, and one cannot be dull when Peter is in
the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
I hear Amelia's footsteps.  She enters the room
and tells me I <i>must</i> get up.  It is useless asking her
to permit me to have "a little slumber, a little sleep,
a little folding of the hands to sleep," for she tells
me that it is dining-room day, which means that she
must clean it, and cannot waste any more time on an
idle, troublesome girl.
</p>

<p>
I ask her if I may lie in Nature's own garments
under the apple tree, with just a soft, silken
coverlet thrown over me; and she is scandalised, and says
most probably Mr. Brook, the vicar, or Mrs. Cobbold
may call.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia," I say, "I am tired of your threatening
me with Mr. Brook.  We have lived here for six
months, and he does not seem to be dreaming of
calling upon us.  As for Mrs. Cobbold&mdash;well, she
will never call again."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brook has been ill," she argues.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Brook might have called."
</p>

<p>
"She has been too busy nursing him."
</p>

<p>
"Poor woman!  She must be quite glad of an
excuse, then, not to call," I said.  "I have the
truest sympathy for clergymen's wives, always
going to see stupid parishioners because it is
considered their duty.  I only hope she will not call."
</p>

<p>
"We never use the best china," said Amelia sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Use it while mother is here," I said cheeringly;
"it will be a good opportunity."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"It's too good for common use.  Mrs. Macintosh
might stay a fortnight, and <i>he</i> might smash
it."  ("<i>He</i>" is Peter.)
</p>

<p>
I ask her what they are doing with themselves,
and she says Peter is scrattlin' his feet about on the
doorstep like an old hen.
</p>

<p>
She attacks me with a brush, and I implore her to
permit my hair to hang loose to-day.  I explain that
it is all in a tangle, and perhaps a passing breeze
might disentangle it, so saving us much trouble.
She regards me severely, and says no breeze will
think of knocking about, that it is about 80
degrees in the shade, and that if I wish Mr. Brook
to see me, of course&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Put it up," I cry; "and if you dangle Mr. Brook
in front of my eyes <i>once</i> again I will throw
something at you."
</p>

<p>
She tells me to calm myself, and, picking me up,
lays me on the couch and trundles me out of the
front door.
</p>

<p>
And here I lie refusing to do anything but gaze
at the soft, white, eider-down clouds which seem to
be trying to tuck up the blue.  Amelia has tried to
make me eat.  I have refused.  Mother has tried
to engage me in a conversation about Dimbie&mdash;artful
mother!  I have refused.  Peter has tried
to draw me into a quarrel.  I have still refused.
And now they have all gone away and left me.
Praised be the gods!
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
As the shadows began to lengthen upon the lawn
I fell asleep, and when I opened my eyes, very
slowly, for I did not want to return to a world
without Dimbie, I found Dr. Renton sitting at the
side of my couch watching me intently.  I fancied
that he had been there for some time, and I felt
vaguely uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"May I smoke?" was his first question.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," I said.  "Have you been here long?"
</p>

<p>
"About half an hour."  He struck a match.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you wake me?"
</p>

<p>
"You had a bad night?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"It was the heat."
</p>

<p>
"Where's your husband?  It's time he was
home, isn't it?"  He took out his watch.
</p>

<p>
"He's away."
</p>

<p>
"Away!  Well, he's no right to be away when
you are so&mdash;feeling the heat.  What's he doing?"
</p>

<p>
"My husband was obliged to go to an aunt of his
who was dying," I said with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"What does she mean by dying now?" he said
with asperity.
</p>

<p>
"She's not, she's dead."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that's better!" he observed in a most
shameless manner.  "He will be returning to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"Not for four days.  He must wait for the funeral.
This aunt practically brought him up."
</p>

<p>
"Well, she's not bringing him up now," he said,
marching about the lawn.  "His duty lies at home."
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie knows his duty as well as any man," I
said stiffly.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Renton laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You think I am fretting for him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do.  Your face is like a bit of white notepaper."
</p>

<p>
"The heat," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Are you eating properly?"
</p>

<p>
"Who could eat in this weather?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you sleeping well?"
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Renton, I don't want to talk of myself."
</p>

<p>
"But we must.  What's the matter with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Are you tired?"
</p>

<p>
"I have just been to sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Marguerite," he said sternly, sitting
down and staring into my face, "answer my
questions properly&mdash;I am your medical adviser&mdash;or I
will call in Mr. Rovell; in fact, I am going to persuade
Rovell to have a look at you in any case."
</p>

<p>
"Call in Mr. Rovell?" I said blankly.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Candidly, I am not satisfied with your appearance.
You are much thinner."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rovell can't make me fatter."
</p>

<p>
"I shall bring him this week&mdash;say Thursday."
</p>

<p>
I stared at him, dismayed and frightened.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see the sense of making Dimbie fork out
another big fee," I quavered, "and I'm&mdash;I'm quite
well."
</p>

<p>
"Are you?  How's the back?"
</p>

<p>
"It's quite&mdash;well, thanks."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were truthful."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's pretty well."
</p>

<p>
"Marguerite," he said gently, holding my hand,
"I don't want to frighten you.  As you say, your
white, rose-leaf face and hands may be the result of
the great heat, but&mdash;I think it well to have another
opinion.  It cannot do you any harm, it may do you
good, and at any rate it will satisfy me."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
MARGUERITE, I DON'T WANT TO FRIGHTEN YOU
</p>

<p>
"Very well," I said, laying my face on his hand
for a moment, "but I&mdash;<i>am</i> frightened."
</p>

<p>
"I know," he replied.  "I have seen fear,
sickening anxiety, written on the faces of many of my
patients when the great specialist&mdash;the man who
will pronounce their doom or otherwise&mdash;has
entered the room, only to be followed by a great joy.
We must hope and pray that this joy will be yours.
It must be," he said almost savagely, getting up
and kicking over his chair.  "You are too young
always to lie still."  The last words were muttered
to himself but I caught them, and a momentary
darkness rose before my eyes, but I brushed it away
as something tangible.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;but you do think it will be well with me,
Dr. Renton?" and the bitter entreaty of my cry
startled my own ears.
</p>

<p>
Voices came across the garden, and mother and
Peter appeared through the gate.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Renton hesitated a moment, and then went
to meet them.
</p>

<p>
My question remained unanswered.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
</h3>

<h4>
MY WORST FEARS ARE REALISED
</h4>

<p>
The day has come at last on which Dimbie is
to return, and&mdash;I am not glad.  That I,
his wife, should ever write such words seems almost
unbelievable.  But, oh&mdash;I am not ready for him!
I am not yet brave enough to smile.  I shrink from
the thought of meeting the look of happiness in
his blue eyes, of hearing the joyous ring of his
voice, of seeing the whimsical, crooked smile on
his lips.  For how can I return the look, how smile
back at him when my heart is wellnigh breaking,
and every fibre of my being will be concentrated in
keeping my lips steady, my eyes undimmed?
</p>

<p>
And yet I must smile&mdash;somehow.
</p>

<p>
It matters not that my happiness is marred so
long as Dimbie never knows it&mdash;if my tears fall in
the darkness when he is asleep; if my spirit cries
out in its anguish, and only God hears.  God will
not mind as Dimbie would mind, for Dimbie loves
me.  It is hard to believe that God loves me, or
why give me such happiness just for a little while
only to wrest it from me?  It is He who has crippled
me for life; He who gave me strong young limbs,
only to strike them helpless; He who filled me with
a passionate love for Nature, only to shut me away
from her forever within four walls.
</p>

<p>
And yet Christian people tell us that He is a God
of love.  Love?  I smile, it seems so strange that
they should believe this.  And they will come along
and say very kindly, very gently, "You loved Dimbie
too much, you made an idol of him.  God has sent
you this trial to bring you to Him.  He must always
come first."  And you wonder at their lack of
understanding.  Do they not know that you come closest
to God in your moments of supreme happiness?
It is then you want to creep away to a quiet spot
and thank Him, on your knees, for giving you such
happiness.  It is then you look upon all the wonders
of the world with understanding eyes.  It is then
you try to help those who suffer and are sick.  Oh,
dear religious people, it is you who don't understand!
It is not sorrow which brings men and women to
God, it is joy.  It would seem to me a poor sort of
thing to go to God when you are down on your
luck&mdash;to make Him a substitute for husband,
home, friends; in fact, to call upon Him when
everything else has failed.  That sort of religion
does not appeal to me!
</p>

<p>
I was grateful to Him, too, for my happiness, for
giving me Dimbie.  In my contentment I think I
tried to lead a better life, to be more tender-hearted,
more charitable, less down upon other people's
shortcomings; and now&mdash;God has forgotten me.
</p>

<p>
O God, were you not a little sorry for me when
they&mdash;the doctors had gone, stepped out into the
beautiful wide world, and left me alone a helpless,
stricken creature?  Did you not feel a little twinge
of pity when, not believing them, I struggled to
stand, gripped the head of the bed, held out vague,
wandering hands to anything that might help me to
raise myself, only to fall in a huddled, unconscious
heap on the floor?  Or perhaps you said, "Poor,
foolish little child, she is rebellious now; but a day
will come when her spirit will be broken, broken
upon the wheel of suffering."
</p>

<p>
Ah! what am I saying?  Forgive me, O Lord.
I am weak and sorrowful and lonely.  I cannot
understand it yet; I cannot see the reason why.
I am as a little child groping in the darkness.  The
darkness stretches away to an eternity, and I can
see no daylight.  But help me to smile, help me
to smile when Dimbie comes home.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The afternoon is hot and long and very silent.
</p>

<p>
Mother and Peter are gone.  Instinctively mother
knew I wanted to be alone to meet Dimbie.  How
wise mothers are!  She strained me to her breast,
and the hot tears fell upon my face as she said
"Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"A word from you," she whispered, "will always
bring me, even from the very end of the earth."
</p>

<p>
"And what about Peter, little mother?" I asked
tremulously.
</p>

<p>
"Peter must remain at home."
</p>

<p>
"But I think <i>even he is</i> a little sorry for me," I
said gently.
</p>

<p>
She turned away, trying to get her face and lips
still.
</p>

<p>
"In the night I heard him say, 'My little
Marguerite, my poor little girl!'" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, mother!"  A great sob burst from me.
"Don't tell me things like that.  Don't sympathise
with me, for I cannot bear it&mdash;yet.  Just take your
broken girl as a matter of course.  Try to pretend
that I have always been helpless, crippled.  Imagine
me as a little baby once more, needing all your
love and tenderness, but not your sympathy.  It is
sympathy that will make me break down, it is
sympathy that will make me weep.  And I am
trying to keep all my strength for Dimbie.  If I
cry I shall become weak, and then I shan't be able
to smile when he comes through the garden-gate.
Don't give me sympathy, mother."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
It is five o'clock.  In an hour's time Dimbie will
be here.
</p>

<p>
The day has passed desperately slowly, and yet all
too quickly, for I am not ready for him yet.  My
smile is still trembly.  I feel my lips quiver as I
practise it.  Amelia looks at me out of the corner
of her eye.  How can she know what I am doing&mdash;that
I am engaged in smiling exercises?  A new
feature of my curious mental condition, she thinks.
But Amelia is very gentle and patient with me now.
She does not want me to know that there is any
difference in her method of treating me.  She is still
firm and managing, but an unwonted softness creeps
into her voice and manner when she addresses me.
She has not referred to my trouble, and I
understand why.  She is cheating herself into believing
that the doctors have made a mistake, and she
thinks she is cheating me into the same belief.  In
an off-hand way she will refer to Mr. Tompkins
having been told by a famous specialist that he was
suffering from "hangina pectorate," and how it was
nothing of the kind, but simply indigestion through
eating Welsh rabbit six nights out of seven; and
how the second Miss Tompkins was told unless she
had an operation she would be dead in a week, and
how she ran away from the nursing home to which
she had been taken and so saved her life, as she
never had it done.
</p>

<p>
Amelia's recitations help to pass the time.  Just
now I pretended I wanted tea, hoping to decoy her
into staying with me a while when she came to
remove the tray, but she said she was busy.
</p>

<p>
"Busy!" I ejaculated, "on a sultry afternoon like
this.  What can you be doing?"
</p>

<p>
And she asked me if I imagined the work got done
itself.  And if I thought an oven never wanted
washing out with quicklime.
</p>

<p>
"What do you do that for?" I said eagerly.
</p>

<p>
From certain well-known signs I thought Amelia
was preparing for a gossip, but I was disappointed,
for she picked up the tray and moved towards the
house.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you quicklime the oven?" I called after
her desperately.  I could not face another long
half-hour alone.
</p>

<p>
She put the tray down on to the step and walked
slowly back.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really want to know, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, to sweeten it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Doesn't the lime burn you?"
</p>

<p>
"It would if I got it on to my hands, but I don't."
</p>

<p>
"Where do you get it from?"
</p>

<p>
"I got a big lump out of a field."
</p>

<p>
"Do you&mdash;do you find lime in fields?"
</p>

<p>
She eyed me with pity.
</p>

<p>
"A house was being built there," she said
laconically, as she began to walk away.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute," I called.  "There's no hurry.
Where was the field?"
</p>

<p>
She stood and stared at me.
</p>

<p>
"You see, I&mdash;I am very interested in quicklime
and ovens."  I spoke rapidly.  "Did the
Tompkinses quicklime their oven?"
</p>

<p>
Amelia fell into the trap like a mouse.
</p>

<p>
"They didn't till I taught 'em.  They didn't do
anythink like that till I showed 'em how.  When
I went there first, the oven was like that tex in the
Bible."
</p>

<p>
"Which text?" I asked with relief, for she had
seated herself upon the grass.
</p>

<p>
"'It stank in your nostrils.'"
</p>

<p>
"Dear me," I said, "how unpleasant."
</p>

<p>
"Heverythink tasted of ovens.  You know the
taste, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure that I do."
</p>

<p>
"It's like bad hot fat."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then, I'm sure I don't.  And so you cleaned it."
</p>

<p>
"It came off in cakes.  I had to take a knife to it."
</p>

<p>
"The lime?"
</p>

<p>
She eyed me sadly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you're not listenin', mum?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm just tellin' you as how I put the lime on,
and you asks me if I took it off.  It's the
dirt&mdash;the fat I'm speaking of now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course.  It's the dirt you are speaking
of&mdash;the fat that stank in your nostrils."  I added
this last to show how very sure I was of my ground.
But this didn't appease her.  She was in a contrary
mood, and rose.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go," I cried.  "Wait, I have something
important to ask you.  I&mdash;" feverishly I cudgelled
my brains&mdash;"I want to know the name of the poet
who used to go to the Tompkinses', and looked like
a garden leek.  Was it by any chance"&mdash;I picked
up a book&mdash;"William Watson?"
</p>

<p>
"No, mum, William Potts."
</p>

<p>
"A poet named Potts?  You must be mistaken.
A poet could not be named Potts."
</p>

<p>
Amelia set her lips doggedly.
</p>

<p>
"This one was."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he was a tinker really, or you are
mistaken in the name, as I said before.  Poets have
musical-sounding names, such as Wordsworth,
Tennyson, Byron."
</p>

<p>
Amelia was evidently trying to keep her temper.
</p>

<p>
"This man was named Potts, I know it for a
fact, for I always remembered it by thinking of
kettles."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, whenever I wants to remember a name I
think of somethink else like it, <i>that</i> helps me.  When
that stout lady called on you I thought of a cobbler."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mrs. Cobbold," I said brightly, pleased at
being able to follow her meaning.
</p>

<p>
She cheered up a little.
</p>

<p>
"Now, when your father, General Macintosh,
came, I just thinks quickly of your waterproof
hangin' in the hall."
</p>

<p>
"I see."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think it's a good plan, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"Most brilliant," I replied.  "When you want to
remember to feed the canary you say to yourself
the word 'sparrows.'"
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.  I was not looking at Amelia.
I was, therefore, unprepared for the blinding
sarcasm which followed.
</p>

<p>
"That's it, mum.  When I wants to remember
to boil some pertaters I straightway puts on a
cabbage.  When I'm trying to recollect to clean the
master's patent boots I washes his golf stockin's.
You've got it quite right, mum.  You've understood
my meanin'.  I'm not blamin' you.  Folks can't
help the hinterlecks as God gives 'em, and I'm not
blamin' you," and picking herself up she marched
into the house.
</p>

<p>
I laughed weakly for some minutes after she had
gone.  She might have been watching me through
the pantry window&mdash;I care not.
</p>

<p>
"Bless you, Amelia, for living with me and looking
after me and amusing me.  I know the kindness
of your heart as well as the sharpness of your tongue.
I know with what infinite tact you keep away from
the subject of my infirmity, and I am grateful to you."
</p>

<p>
Presently she was out again.  I was lying with
my eyes closed.
</p>

<p>
"You're tired, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"A little," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I get a flower to put in your gown before
the master comes?  It will freshen you up a
bit."
</p>

<p>
"How do I look?"
</p>

<p>
She carefully selected a beautiful red rose.
</p>

<p>
"There are two spots the colour of this rose in
the middle of your cheeks."
</p>

<p>
"I look well, then?" I asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
She sniffed a little.
</p>

<p>
"I've seen folks as looked better."
</p>

<p>
"Bring me a hand-glass."
</p>

<p>
She went slowly to the house.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know as you was vain, mum," she
observed, as she put it into my hand.
</p>

<p>
"You can go back to your oven now, Amelia,"
I said a little frigidly.
</p>

<p>
I waited till she had gone, and then raised the
glass.  Two great, dark, burning eyes looked into
mine.  My cheeks were wasted, and my hair lay in
a damp cloud on my forehead.  All the gold which
Dimbie loved so much seemed to have gone out of it.
In the relentless light of day, fascinated, I gazed at
my strangely-altered countenance.
</p>

<p>
"And once Dimbie thought that face beautiful!"  The
words burst from me in a sob, but no tears
came.  My aching eyes turned to the roses and
lupins which were drooping in the hot afternoon
sunshine, to the hedge of wondrous-tinted sweet-peas,
to the cool, green limes and beech tree leaning over
the fence.
</p>

<p>
"How lovely to be inanimate!" I cried passionately.
"To be without a soul, without a memory,
without a future.  To be a soft, fragrant rose
wrapped round by the sun and the wind and summer
rain, sending forth a sweetness to gladden the heart
of man, and then falling petal by petal to the cool,
kind embrace of mother earth."
</p>

<p>
Why should humans suffer so?  Why should all
this pain be?  Animals and birds and fish and
insects prey upon one another.  They drink to the
dregs the cup of physical suffering, but they are
spared the anguish of mental pain.
</p>

<p>
Will Dimbie's love stand?
</p>

<p>
Ah, that is what is torturing me day and night!
</p>

<p>
Will Dimbie remain faithful?
</p>

<p>
He is but young.  Life is before him.  He still lives
in the present and future, only the old live in the
past.  To be tied forever to a helpless wife, to a
creature wedded to a couch, to a stricken, maimed
woman.  Oh, how I hate myself!  I despise my
own weakness and impotence.  Once I was a
strong girl, who could run and dance and scale high
mountains.  Dimbie said my eyes were as bright as
stars in the frosty heavens, my hair as gold as the
setting sun, my cheeks&mdash;ah, he flattered me!  And
now, God help&mdash;but no, there is no one to help
me.  God has forgotten me!
</p>

<p>
Bring a brush, Amelia, and try to weave into my
dull hair a little of the bright sunshine.  Pin the
red rose you gathered into my gown.  Twine
around your finger the damp tendrils which lie on my
forehead, and make them curl as of old.  Tell me
a funny story of the Tompkinses to straighten up
the droop of my mouth.  For Dimbie is coming
down the lane&mdash;I hear his footstep eager and fast&mdash;and
I want to look like the Marguerite he married.
</p>

<p>
A bird has broken into song in the apple tree&mdash;a
golden melody.  Is he singing for the coming of
Dimbie?  Or is he a harbinger of hope?  Does he
mean that Dimbie's love <i>will</i> stand&mdash;last throughout
the ages?  Oh, that it might be so!  I would
rather be a cripple with Dimbie's love than whole
and strong without it.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
</h3>

<h4>
DIMBIE ROLLS A GREAT LOAD FROM MY HEART
</h4>

<p>
In the crises of life&mdash;the tremendous moments
of fear, hope, and expectation&mdash;what a curious
calmness overtakes us.  Maud's poor lover, after
killing her brother in the duel, says&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Why am I sitting here so stunn'd and still,<br />
  Plucking the harmless wild-flower on the hill?"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And later on, when he sits on the Breton strand, he
says&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Strange that the mind when fraught<br />
  With a passion so intense<br />
  One would think that it well<br />
  Might drown all life in the eye,&mdash;<br />
  That it should, by being so over-wrought,<br />
  Suddenly strike on a sharper sense<br />
  For a shell, or a flower, little things<br />
  Which else would have been passed by."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And so it was with me, I "suddenly struck on a
sharper sense" as Dimbie came through the gate,
and I had nothing to say in the first moment of
greeting but to tell him that a button was missing
from one of his boots and his coat was very dusty.
</p>

<p>
His look of utter astonishment expelled my
apathy, and when his arms were round me and he
was showering kisses upon my face and hair, and
whispering, "Marguerite, Marguerite, have you
nothing else to say?" in an overwhelming torrent
it came to me what I <i>had</i> to say, what I had to tell
him.  The reality of it suffocated me, I felt as
though I were drowning.  I could only cling to
him murmuring his name.
</p>

<p>
"Dear love," he whispered at length, "say that
you love me!"
</p>

<p>
"Love you!" I cried, finding speech.  "Love
you!  Ah, Dimbie, it is not for you to ask such a
question.  It is <i>I</i> who must put it to you.  Do you
love me?  Can you always love me&mdash;forever and
ever, whatever happens to me?  Whatever I am&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I broke off.  "Whatever I am," I repeated mechanically.
</p>

<p>
Again he looked at me, held my face away from
his, and surprise and bewilderment chased across
his countenance.
</p>

<p>
I could not meet the look in his eyes, and my own
fell.
</p>

<p>
He took my hands in his and held them to his lips
very tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"Love you as you are, whatever you are!  Why
of course, that is why I shall love you always,
because you are Marguerite.  You may grow blind
and deaf, and old and feeble, but you will always
be my Marguerite.  That is the beautiful part, we
shall always have each other&mdash;to the end.  Aunt
Letitia's was a lonely life and a lonely death.  Only
old Ann and I with her.  No husband nor children,
nor brothers nor sisters, no one very closely related;
only I, a nephew, and an old servant."  He settled
himself on the grass at the side of the couch and
leant his head against my knee.  "But you and I
will have each other for ever.  But I am not going
to talk of sad things&mdash;not that Aunt Letitia's death
in itself was sad, for it was very peaceful and
beautiful&mdash;but I want to talk of the delights of being
home again, of sitting in our jolly little garden with
my own dear wife, and of the said wife's stroking
her husband's head."  He raised his blue eyes to
mine and pulled my hand down to his hair, and
perforce I had to stroke it.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell him yet," I cried to myself.  "We
must have this beautiful hour together.  Later
on&mdash;perhaps when the dusk has fallen."
</p>

<p>
He sighed contentedly as my hand passed over
his crisp, kinky hair, and took Jumbles, who was
purring and arching his back, on to his knee.
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me the news, wife," he commanded.
"First of all, how are you?  Has Renton been to
see you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I replied after a pause, "he came the
other day."
</p>

<p>
"And what does he think?"
</p>

<p>
"He thinks"&mdash;I caught at my breath&mdash;"that I
am thinner and&mdash;not quite so well."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie turned round quickly and gave me a
prolonged scrutiny.  Then he threw Jumbles off
his knee and got up.
</p>

<p>
"You are decidedly thinner, Marg.  Let me feel
your arms."
</p>

<p>
"My arms," I said, trying to smile, "were always
so abominably fat that it is an improvement their
being thinner."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie felt me carefully, then his mouth set in
a hard, straight line.
</p>

<p>
"We must get you away from here," he said, "to
the sea, or somewhere bracing.  By the time you
are ready to walk about there will be nothing left
of you to walk."
</p>

<p>
"By the time you are ready to walk about," I
started.  Amelia was coming across the lawn, and
heard Dimbie's words.  Her lips parted.  She was
going to tell him.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia," I cried, "come here quickly.  The&mdash;the
tortoise is slipping down the couch."
</p>

<p>
"And that won't be the first time, mum," she
returned, diving after it.  "And you won't have a
pocket, mum."
</p>

<p>
"Shake up my cushions, please, and&mdash;" I
whispered in her ear as she leaned over me, "don't
tell the master yet."
</p>

<p>
"What are you two up to?" asked Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia is bringing you some tea, and we are
going to have supper in the garden.  I always have
supper under the apple tree when it's fine," I said
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it a bit earwiggy?"
</p>

<p>
"It is; but to make up for that there is the
night-scented stock, and a corncrake in the field.  Peter
got very angry with the corncrake and the frogs."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, where are Peter and your mother?
It is very decent of them to have gone out and
left us alone for a bit."
</p>

<p>
"They are gone home," I replied.  "A seismic
movement of the earth's crust is now taking place
at Dorking."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Not very polite to me to clear off just as I was
returning."
</p>

<p>
"I think Peter feared you might quarrel with him."
</p>

<p>
"A nice way of putting it.  How did he and
Amelia get on?"
</p>

<p>
"They didn't get on at all.  Amelia gave me
notice to leave, and Peter flung dinner plates on
to the floor.  I think he had been reading about
Savage Landor's pitching crockery about when he
was a little annoyed."
</p>

<p>
"I'd have pitched him out of the house."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "that was why I felt glad you
were not at home."
</p>

<p>
Amelia appeared with the tray.
</p>

<p>
"How did you like General Macintosh, Amelia?"
asked Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
She sniffed and tilted her head.
</p>

<p>
"I gave him his half-sovereign back when he
went this morning; that will show you how much I
liked him, sir.  He nearly wore the mistress and me
out.  I managed him though in the end."
</p>

<p>
"What did you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I peppered him and Keatinged him
just as though he was a house-moth."
</p>

<p>
We both stared at her.
</p>

<p>
"Readin' a book made me think of it; it was
about a duchess and a baby, and the baby kept
sneezin'.  'This will do for him,' says I to myself.
So I buys a quarter of a pound of pepper and a
tin of Keating's moth powder, and I sprinkles his
pillow and hairbrushes, and handkerchiefs and
pyjamas, and shaving-brush and his clothes, and
the sneezin' which took place after that was
somethin' dreadful.  His eyes and nose was runnin', and
he says he had a dreadful attack of influenza.
Don't you remember, mum?"
</p>

<p>
She looked at me, but I made no answer.  He
was, after all, my father, and I must not sympathise
with Amelia in her depravity.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said Dimbie encouragingly, helping
himself to a large supply of strawberry jam.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he came and danced about my kitchen
like a hathlete at the circus.  Couldn't have
believed pepper could have made anythink so active,
and with his gout, sir.  I couldn't get him out of
the kitchen for hever so long."
</p>

<p>
"And what did you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I just fetched the pepper-pot and shook
it at him, one shake and he fairly raced.  And
Jumbles began a-sneezin' too, and rushed off to the
roof of the shed; there was legs flying in all directions."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie tilted back his chair and roared with
laughter.
</p>

<p>
"And was he polite to you after that?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty well, sir.  He had to be.  Every time
he was going to break out I just casual-like referred
to the pepper.  I would ask Mrs. Macintosh if there
was enough of it in her soup, or if the curry was
too hot."
</p>

<p>
"You are a strategist, Amelia," said Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," she replied, without comprehension.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You can outwit the enemy."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
She moved towards the house.  She was wearing
the tea-rose slippers again.  Dimbie caught sight of
them.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you wearing my slippers?  How dare
you, Amelia!"
</p>

<p>
She stood nonplussed for a moment, then, "The
mistress won't allow <i>you</i> to wear them, sir, and I
thought it was a pity for them to be wasted," and
she disappeared into the house.
</p>

<p>
We looked at each other and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"She is a good girl, and looks after you well,
doesn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"Excellently."
</p>

<p>
"But I think we will get another maid&mdash;one
who is more used to invalids."
</p>

<p>
"No one but Amelia shall look after me; besides,
we can't afford," I said decidedly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we can afford right enough, Marg.  Wouldn't
you like one, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I wouldn't."
</p>

<p>
He smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't get so heated about it, you shan't if
you don't like.  You shan't do anything or have
anything contrary to your wishes."
</p>

<p>
"You are very good to me, Dimbie, dear;" and
tears trembled in my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever's the matter?" he said in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"I'm only tired.  I have been so excited about
your coming."
</p>

<p>
"Poor darling!" he murmured softly.  "It's this
hot weather that is making you so weary.  I'm
going to read you to sleep, and you must sleep till
supper.  What shall it be?"  He picked up one or
two of the books from the table.  "<i>Omar</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm tired of <i>Omar</i>."
</p>

<p>
<i>"The Garden of Allah</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"No, beautiful but sad."
</p>

<p>
"What, then?"
</p>

<p>
I lay and thought.  Dimbie had a musical voice;
he read well.  I wanted something to suit his voice.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>," I said.  "It's on the
drawing-room table."
</p>

<p>
He fetched it, and turned the pages.
</p>

<p>
"What part do you fancy?"
</p>

<p>
"Anywhere, so long as I can see you while you read."
</p>

<p>
He stooped and kissed me, and holding one of
my hands in his he began.
</p>

<p>
Very little of the beautiful language did I hear,
for I was thinking and pondering upon what I
should say to him later.  How should I tell him?
How break my news?  The shock would be so
great; I must choose my words carefully.  "Help
me to say the right thing," I prayed I know not to
whom.  "Help me to choose the right words, and
let him go on loving me."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
And Dimbie himself made it all quite easy for
me, for before I spoke or told him his own words
rolled a great load from my heart.
</p>

<p>
We had finished supper, the darkness had fallen,
and a moon swam in a sky of the deepest blue.
Heavy on the warm night air lay the perfume of
the roses, the night-scented stock, and the flowering
lime, in which a thousand and one bees had been
humming throughout the day.  Now they were
asleep, and the lime was at rest.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie, with his arm around me, was telling me
of Aunt Letitia's death, and how glad she was to
go; how quietly and simply she had talked of her
business affairs, of the disposal of her money, of
her legacies.  She had left her house in order, and
with the faith of a little child had set out on the
long, unknown journey fearless and with a great
trust in the mercy of God.
</p>

<p>
"At the last she said to me, 'From what you have
told me I quite seem to know Marguerite, and I
should have loved her I am sure.  I feel she is
good.  Some good women are very unlovable; they
are hard on the frailties of others.  In their
unsmirched purity they cannot understand the meaning
of the words temptation, sin; but I do not think
Marguerite is one of these.  I should imagine she
would be very tender towards those who are weak,
for she understands and knows the mercy of God.'"
</p>

<p>
"The mercy of God."  The words rang in my
ears&mdash;dinned and hammered and beat.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> understand the mercy of God!  Dimbie,
Dimbie, Aunt Letitia is wrong.  I don't, I don't.
I'm wicked, I'm rebellious, I&mdash;&mdash;"  My words broke
off in a bitter cry, and I clung to him with both
hands.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, hush, my dear one," he said, holding me
closely.  "If you are wicked it is a poor lookout for
the rest of humanity.  Why, to myself, I always
call you my white Marguerite.  I&mdash;" he paused,
and I could hear the beating of his heart&mdash;"I want
to tell you now what you have made of me, of my
manhood.  I have wanted to tell you ever since I
first met you, but&mdash;it is difficult to lay your heart
bare, even to the woman you love, but&mdash;I think
I'm a better man now, Marguerite.  I was a careless,
selfish sort of beggar before, I only thought
of myself.  The down-on-their-luck fellows were
down through their own fault I supposed.  The
women on the streets disgusted me; the sick and
suffering I shunned as something repulsive; the poor
and hungry bored me with their whining.  Then I
met you.  You gave me something priceless&mdash;your
love.  I knew I was not worthy of it, but you
married me.  Then came your accident and illness.
Will you think me cruel when I tell you I was almost
glad?  Now I could do something for you, wait on
you, take care of you, cherish you, I thought, try to
make myself worthy of your love.  And your first
question was, Would my love stand the strain of
your illness?  Ah, Marguerite, how those words hurt,
how they cut me to the heart.  'She doesn't
understand me,' I cried, 'she has no faith in me.'  And
have you still no faith in me?  Do you not trust me?
Marguerite, wife, were you to be stricken for life,
always tied down to your couch, always a helpless
invalid, I should feel that you were a sacred trust
given to me by God to love and cherish.  And&mdash;so
long as you gave me your love I should be more than
content.  Do you still doubt me, fear that my
affection would waver?  Tell me that you trust me.
Speak, Marguerite."
</p>

<p>
And I spoke, very slowly at first.  The words came
haltingly, brokenly.  I was trying to keep the tears
back&mdash;tears not of sorrow now, but of joy.  As my
husband was speaking sorrow left me, and my soul
was irradiated with a great and wondrous happiness.
I forgot my tired body, it seemed to fade away,
dissolve, and only my spirit was left behind singing a
<i>Te Deum</i>.  My doubts, my fears had gone.  Dimbie
would <i>always</i> love me.  I believed him as truly as
I believed that the sun would rise on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie, dear," I said simply, "I <i>do</i> believe you,
and I do trust you.  Your words to-night have made
that which I have to tell you quite easy.  I&mdash;shall
never walk again."  My arm stole round his neck
and I drew his cheek to mine.  "No, don't speak
till I have finished.  I want to tell you all about
it now&mdash;everything.  Then we will accept it as
the inevitable and never speak of it again.  You
say that I am patient, good.  When the doctors had
left me&mdash;Dr. Renton had broken it to me&mdash;I
railed against God.  I cried out in my agony, 'This
cross is greater than I can bear!'  I beat the pillows,
tried to tear the sheets, struck my head against the
bed.  I longed to die.  I prayed to die.  I struggled
to rise, only to fall in unconsciousness on the floor.
This unconsciousness, I think, saved my reason.
And, oh, the tears I shed, the bitter tears!  I was
glad you were not there, Dimbie.  In the darkness
of the night, even as Job, I cried out, 'Let the day
perish wherein I was born!'  Never to walk again&mdash;the
words rang in my ears.  Always to lie still.
The wind and sea would call me, but I must lie
still.  Spring and summer would call me, but I
must lie still, always still.  Never stretch my limbs
in the sunshine or feel the mountain air upon my
face.  Never hear the wind in the corn, or listen to
the soft falling of the pine-needles in the woods.
Dimbie, that night has left its mark upon my brow,
I fear.  I felt as though I had been seared with a
hot iron.  I quivered when they touched me&mdash;Peter,
mother, Amelia&mdash;they all came to me, and
I cried, 'Leave me, leave me!'"
</p>

<p>
With a passionate movement Dimbie made to
speak, but I laid my fingers on his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," I said.  "Hush, dear.  I don't feel
unhappy now, that has all gone, you have sent it away.
For above all my grief there was a sorrow which was
a thousand-fold more keen, more bitter.  I doubted
you.  I doubted your love, and I did not in my
mind reproach you, Dimbie.  'He is young and
strong,' I cried, 'and I am a cripple.  He cannot
spend the remainder of his life with a hopeless
invalid.  Nature demands a healthy mate.  I
cannot expect him to be faithful to me.'
</p>

<p>
"But, oh, I felt I could not give you up!  I loved
you so.  You were <i>my</i> husband.  No other woman
should have you.  And&mdash;I looked at my face.  It
is a little pitiful when a woman comes to look at her
face, I think.  Is it the men's fault, I wonder?  Ah,
and what the mirror told me!  I put it from me, and
I laughed mirthlessly.  'That will never hold him,'
I said, and so I drew nearer and nearer to my
Gethsemane and my cup was wellnigh full.
And&mdash;then you came, and I woke as from a hideous
nightmare; my sorrow and pain and anxiety fell
from me like an old worn-out cloak.  Dimbie,
Dimbie, do you know how you smiled?  In that dear
crooked, whimsical, and most loving smile lay a
woman's heaven&mdash;a heaven upon earth&mdash;and
without you she wants no other paradise."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie's arms were around me as I finished.
His tears fell upon my face, but he did not speak.
In each other's arms we lay, wrapped around by the
still, warm, scented night, and the silence was more
beautiful than words.  Later on, when he carried
me to bed, he knelt down and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I thank Thee for my most precious wife, O
Lord, so much more precious now that she is&mdash;she
is&mdash;brok&mdash;&mdash;"  He paused, and, getting up, went
quietly out of the room.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
</h3>

<h4>
WE INHERIT A FORTUNE
</h4>

<p>
I have done with sadness forever.
</p>

<p>
Who could be sad on an afternoon such as
this?  Is the witchery of spring with us once more? we
ask; for it has rained for a week, and now every
faded green thing&mdash;leaf and grass and hedges&mdash;are
chortling with pride over their fresh, bright
raiment.  They are as maidens of fifteen mincing
in their new frocks.
</p>

<p>
The roses are holding up their heads and inviting
you to bury your face in the heart of their sweetness
where some raindrops still remain.  You gladly do
as you are bidden, and Amelia, who has brought
them to you, thinks you are an eccentric creature
to go sighing and sniffing and kissing their wet
petals in such sentimental fashion.
</p>

<p>
"The sweetest flower that blows," you sing, and
she says they are nothing of the kind, that "vi'lets
take the cake."
</p>

<p>
"The master will be home at half-past four," you
tell her, and she says you have mentioned this fact
at least half a dozen times.
</p>

<p>
"Only twice, Amelia," I say.  "You should learn
to speak the truth."  And she steps deliberately on
to the tortoise, which lies on the grass, in order to
teach me that I may allow it to stray once too often.
I tell her I am sorry, and she suggests that I should
tie it round my neck suspended from a ribbon, and
people might take it for an enlarged miniature of
one of my relations.
</p>

<p>
I ignore her remark, and watch a thrush who is
having a succulent feast of worms after the rain.
I wonder at the worms being so easily deceived as
to imagine that the stamping of the thrush's small
feet is an earthquake, bringing them out of their
burrows with a run.
</p>

<p>
"Miniatures are fashionable," she continues.
</p>

<p>
I am still engrossed in the thrush.
</p>

<p>
"That one of you in the drawing-room is not bad,
but a bit flattering."
</p>

<p>
"Miniature of me?" I say lazily, refusing to be
interested in Amelia's conversation.  "I have never
had a miniature painted in my life.  The one to
which you are referring is the master's great-aunt,
painted when she was a girl."
</p>

<p>
She walks on high, sloping heels to the house
with her head well up.
</p>

<p>
In about two minutes she returns with ill-concealed
triumph written on her face, and places a
portrait of myself on my knees.  In surprise I pick
it up and examine it closely.  Yes, it is I, and&mdash;my
heart contracts painfully as I look at it.  Have I
that expression in my eyes&mdash;now?  Surely not.
I put it down hastily, as Amelia is watching me.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you like it, mum?  I shouldn't be
disappointed if it was my portrait.  Not but what I
thinks it flatters you.  The master was starin' at
it for half an hour this morning&mdash;never touched
his breakfast, and it was a fried sole, too."
</p>

<p>
I picked up a book.  "It's not bad," I say
carelessly.  "Will you go to the village, Amelia, and
bring me some bull's-eyes&mdash;hot, pepperminty ones.
The master is very fond of bull's-eyes, and so
am I."  I evaded her glance and searched for my
purse.
</p>

<p>
"It's in your pocket, mum.  I stitched one in last
night after you had gone to bed.  Second seam,
right-hand side.  The house was being that
neglected while I was lookin' for things&mdash;purses and
tortises&mdash;that I took the liberty, mum."
</p>

<p>
Now I own to feeling excessively annoyed with
Amelia.  I had particularly requested her not to
stitch a pocket on to me&mdash;anywhere, and she had
disobeyed me.  I had wondered what the hard,
knobly thing I was lying upon could be.  It was
my own purse.  I should not search the second
right-hand seam.  Amelia must be shown that she
could not disobey my commands with impunity.
</p>

<p>
I read my book carefully, and turned its pages
assiduously.
</p>

<p>
"I am waiting for the money, mum."  This in
an injured voice.
</p>

<p>
"There is some in the jewel drawer in my
dressing-table," I said distantly.  "And bring me
my <i>crêpe de chine</i> gown, and kindly remove the
pocket from this one to-night."
</p>

<p>
Amelia's prolonged stare almost broke down my
gravity.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you're holding your book upside down!"
</p>

<p>
"And what if I am?" I retorted.  "If I choose to
read a book upside down that is no concern of yours.
Kindly go."
</p>

<p>
I smiled as she walked slowly to the house.  She
was a very good girl, but must be kept in her place.
</p>

<p>
She was back in a minute.
</p>

<p>
"Here's your money, mum, and did you mean
your grand new lavender gown which your
moth&mdash;I mean Mrs. Macintosh&mdash;sent you?"
</p>

<p>
"That is what I meant," I said.
</p>

<p>
"But it's like a bit of spider's web."  She held it
at arm's-length.  "It's that delikit and lovely, you'll
crush it to pieces."
</p>

<p>
"That is your fault," I said quietly.  "You have
debarred me from wearing the other till the pocket
is removed.  Now help me, please."
</p>

<p>
With dexterous hands she got me out of one
gown and into the other, but I was tired and spent
when she had finished.
</p>

<p>
"You look like a pichir with your gold hair,
mum, though it's not so bright as it was.  Lavender
wouldn't suit me, now, scarlet's my colour, but&mdash;&mdash;"
she broke off with a cry.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever's the matter now?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"There's a pocket in <i>this</i> one, mum," she gasped,
pointing to a gaping seam.
</p>

<p>
I looked and said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Dressmakers is but human, mum.  'Ow was they
to know that you had a prejudice against&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Amelia, <i>will</i> you hush," I almost shouted.  "I
am so tired of your talking so much.  Go and buy
the bull's-eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Will you have this gown off first?" she asked
placidly.
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't.  I am not a load of hay to be
pitched about from pillar to post.  And my gowns
are not legion."
</p>

<p>
"There's the white serge, and the black heolian,
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Amelia," I said, "if you don't go away I shall
ring the tortoise for help&mdash;help from a stranger
passing down the lane.  I am a pestered, servant-driven
creature, and I require as much help as a
drowning man."
</p>

<p>
And she went without another word to me, but
muttering softly to herself, of which I caught a
word or two: "Moidered with the heat!  Poor thing,
I have known as sunstroke&mdash;&mdash;" &amp;c., &amp;c.  She
disappeared round the broom bush, and I laughed
more than I have done for many days.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Dimbie brought great news with him.  He flung
himself down upon the grass, tilted back his hat,
wiped his brow, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I have retired from business, Marg."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that doesn't make sitting upon the damp
grass an act to be commended," I said severely.
</p>

<p>
An amused giggle came from behind me.  It was
Amelia crossing the lawn with a lettuce in her hand.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were getting tea."
</p>

<p>
"So I am, mum.  This here lettuce is for it, and
I just catched what the master said, 'Retired from
business!'"  She put her hands to her hips.  "I'm
thinkin' there'll be a power more work to do now
two for lunch and two for tea hevery day.  And
the master, beggin' his pardon, will be makin' more
mess with his tobacco ash than ever.  It lies about
the carpets like bone manure on a flower-bed."
</p>

<p>
She continued her walk to the house, brandishing
the lettuce and squeaking with emotion, without
giving us time to reply.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia is like a jack-in-the-box.  She seems to
spring from nowhere," said Dimbie depressedly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, never mind.  Go on with what you were
saying, and get up from the grass, it's very damp,
and you are sitting on a multitude of worm-hills."
</p>

<p>
"Give me the end of the couch, then.  Tuck up
your toes.  Did you hear what I said?  I have
retired from business.  I have done with the Stock
Exchange forever, Marg."
</p>

<p>
"This then, I suppose, will be our last meal.
We have no private means."
</p>

<p>
"I will feed you on oysters and champagne!"
</p>

<p>
"Bread-fruit and yams, more likely, on a desert
island, where you can obtain food for nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Marg, I am worth £3,000 a year," he said
gravely, and with suppressed eagerness.
</p>

<p>
I looked at him anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Sunstroke too," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear?  I am worth £3,000 a year.  I
can give you everything you want."
</p>

<p>
He raised his voice excitedly.  And of course
Amelia, who was bringing tea, tipped the hot-water
jug over, and in endeavouring to catch it dropped
the tray, and then sat down among the ruins and
began to weep.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a fool!" said Dimbie.  "Get up! it
doesn't matter."
</p>

<p>
But Amelia remained rooted to the ground,
sobbing her heart out.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't leave, I <i>shan't</i> go," she wailed at length,
looking at me as though I were contradicting her.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you won't," I agreed.  "It's not the
best china.  It doesn't matter the least little bit in
the world, Amelia."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't mean that, mum.  I mean that if
the master's got £3,000 a year&mdash;I couldn't help
hearin'&mdash;there'll be no room for Amelia Cockles.
You won't want me.  You'll keep cook, kitchenmaid,
housemaid, parlour-maid, butler, boots, and
have hentries, hoary-doves, cheese-straws, low
dresses, and dessert every day of the week."
</p>

<p>
She reeled this off without apparently drawing
breath, and I too was breathless at the
contemplation of such a truly awful prospect.
</p>

<p>
"Never!" I said.
</p>

<p>
She looked incredulous.
</p>

<p>
"Never!" I repeated.
</p>

<p>
She sat up on her heels and began to collect the
broken pieces and pick up the bread and butter.
</p>

<p>
"And were I ever to indulge&mdash;I mean saddle
myself with the retinue of servants you
mention&mdash;there would always be room for you, Amelia."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, mum," she sobbed, while eating a
piece of sandy cake in complete unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
"You could be mistress of the robes," said Dimbie
cheeringly.
</p>

<p>
Her sniffs became less frequent.
</p>

<p>
"You could be lady's maid," I said.  "But no
pockets, Amelia.  You understand."
</p>

<p>
She gave a watery smile.
</p>

<p>
"I could find the tortis and brush your hair all
day long, mum."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," I said; "and would you let me
wear plaits?"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated, and then, like the boy who stood on
the burning deck, remained faithful to duty.
</p>

<p>
"People might call."
</p>

<p>
"And if they did?"
</p>

<p>
"Plaits is only proper for little girls and in
bedrooms&mdash;I don't like them there,&mdash;but if the master
doesn't mind <i>I</i> don't."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie broke into roars.
</p>

<p>
"Go and get some more tea," I commanded, "and
make haste."
</p>

<p>
"She's a good, faithful soul," said Dimbie when
she had gone, "and we won't part with her."
</p>

<p>
"Part with her!" I repeated in astonishment.
"I should think not indeed.  Why, if Amelia were
to go I should be lost; and I should not only lose
myself, but the tortoise, my purse&mdash;everything I
possess.  She is my guide, my comforter, my solace
in my lonely hours, and tells me entrancing stories
about the Tompkinses.  I could not do without
Amelia."
</p>

<p>
"And yet I don't know how she would agree with
other servants."
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie, dear," I said petulantly, "don't joke
any longer.  I don't feel like joking and Amelia
dropping trays; they upset my silly nerves."
</p>

<p>
"I am not joking," he returned slowly.  "Aunt
Letitia has left me all her money.  She has lived
simply, almost niggardly, the last few years, poor
old lady.  The money has been accumulating at
compound interest, and we shall have an income of
£3,000 a year and a house in Yorkshire.  What do
you think of that, Marguerite?"
</p>

<p>
He put an arm around me and laughed like a
happy schoolboy.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be able to buy you everything you
want.  We will take a house by the sea, in the
mountains, in the heart of one of your dearly-loved
pine woods&mdash;wherever you wish it, my princess.
You've only to hold up your little finger and your
desire shall be gratified.  We'll bring the roses back
to your pale cheeks in a more bracing climate.  You
might even&mdash;get well&mdash;nearly well.  This garden
is too small and hot.  Now isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I love it better than any other spot in the world,"
I said earnestly.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me with disappointment chasing
across his face.
</p>

<p>
Quickly I said, "Dimbie, dear, I am delighted at
your good luck.  It will be too beautiful to have
plenty of money.  I can hardly believe it yet.  It
seems too good to be true.  And I think you deserve
every little bit of it.  You have been to Aunt Letitia
more than a son.  But&mdash;you won't take me away
from here just yet.  I&mdash;I don't want to go."
</p>

<p>
"You don't want to go to a jolly big house with
nice grounds and smooth lawns?"
</p>

<p>
"What lawn could be smoother than ours?  It is
like velvet."
</p>

<p>
He smiled.
</p>

<p>
"But it's only the size of a&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's big enough to hold the apple tree and me,"
I interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"You shall have grand chestnuts, wind-torn
oaks, and sit under a weeping willow in our new
garden."
</p>

<p>
"I want to sit under my own apple tree," I said
querulously.
</p>

<p>
He surveyed it disdainfully.
</p>

<p>
"It is so beautifully gnarled and old."  I disregarded
the look.  "And you see it has seven apples
on it, and I believe they are going to be red."
</p>

<p>
"We shall be able to use them for cider, perhaps."  His
voice was mocking.
</p>

<p>
"And I don't want to leave the ants; they're so
interesting."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose no other garden contains ants?"
</p>

<p>
"And look at the roses!  Have you ever seen
trees bloom more freely?"
</p>

<p>
"Roses&mdash;in England&mdash;are, of course, extremely rare."
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie," I said, "if you mock me again I shall&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Kiss me, sweetheart," and he held his face to mine.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not kiss you until you promise faithfully
you will not transplant me to another garden.  I&mdash;I
don't want to go yet awhile, Dimbie."
</p>

<p>
"But what shall we do with our money?  There
is nothing to spend it on here," he argued.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I could soon run through it, given the
opportunity.  I should first of all buy new shoes
for Amelia&mdash;lovely, respectable, black, kid shoes,
with neat bows and low heels."
</p>

<p>
"Would they cost seven and sixpence?" he asked
ironically.
</p>

<p>
"Quite," I returned gravely.
</p>

<p>
He walked up and down the lawn impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"But tell me why," he said after a time, standing
still in front of me, "why, Marguerite, my poor
white daisy, you are so anxious to remain here?"
</p>

<p>
"Because&mdash;&mdash;"  I paused.  Ah, no, I must not
tell him <i>yet</i>; it is not time.  Besides, after all, it
may only be my foolish fancy.  "Because," I
continued, "to take me away from the garden that I
love, from our pretty cottage, would be to tear out
my heart-strings.  Perhaps you will think it
sentiment, Dimbie, but I want to finish our year
here&mdash;our wonderful year.  Into the branches and green
lace-work of the trees, into the dewy grass, into the
sweet-peas and roses, into the beech&mdash;which is
always so kind and friendly&mdash;into the frog-pond,
and, above all, into our much-loved apple tree, are
woven a thousand beautiful associations and memories.
The memories, you will say, will remain with
us, be with us wherever we go; but they are not yet
complete.  This is only August.  We have four
months left to finish our year.  Into those four
months may be crowded much happiness, much
simple, quiet joy, and the storehouse of our
'looking back' will be full to the brim and running over.
Let us finish our year here&mdash;you and I and
Amelia&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I turned away to hide my face.
</p>

<p>
"And then&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Why then," I said softly, "I will do whatever
is required of me."
</p>

<p>
He sat down beside me.
</p>

<p>
"Your will will always be mine, Marguerite."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-214"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-214.jpg" alt="YOUR WILL WILL ALWAYS BE MINE, MARGUERITE." />
<br />
YOUR WILL WILL ALWAYS BE MINE, MARGUERITE.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"You and everybody will turn me into the most
selfish creature that ever breathed if I let you have
your way."
</p>

<p>
"And why not?  There is not very much left to
you now."  His voice was a little bitter, and a
shadow crept across his face.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" I said.  "I have nearly everything a
girl could possibly want&mdash;husband, home, friends,
and now riches.  Why," I continued, trying to
divert his thoughts, "why didn't you tell me your
most important news on the day you returned home?
Didn't you know?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I knew.  The will was read after the funeral.
I was going to tell you.  I kept it as a <i>bonne-bouche</i>
till the night fell, and then there was your news&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off and did not finish.
</p>

<p>
"Afterwards," he said a little later, "I waited till
my right to the money was confirmed.  My mother
was inclined to dispute it.  She was Aunt Letitia's
only sister, and considered she had the first claim,
though she had not been to see her for years.  Yorkshire
was too dull for her after the gaieties of London.
Still, she seemed to think the money was hers by
right."  He slowly dissected a sweet-pea.  "I hope
never again to see such a look on any woman's face
as was on my mother's when the will was being
read.  It was very ugly and&mdash;sad.  Poor mother,
she has missed the best things of life."  He sighed
deeply.  Amelia's voice singing "I wouldn't leave
my little wooden hut" came through the pantry
window.
</p>

<p>
"She too is evidently of the same opinion as I,"
I said, smiling.  "She doesn't want to leave."
</p>

<p>
"You are in collusion, that is quite clear.  Two
women are too much for any one man, especially
when one of the women is an Amelia.  We will stay
here and see the old year out, Marg.  Your wishes
are but commands.  What is your desire now, my
princess&mdash;to be wheeled nearer the sweet-peas?"  He
stroked my cheek lovingly.
</p>

<p>
"Was there ever a husband like mine?" I asked
myself.  And aloud, "Go and tell Amelia to sing
less loudly, and inquire of her the size in shoes she
takes."

CHAPTER XX
</h3>

<h4>
PROFESSOR LEIGHRAIL PAYS US A CALL
</h4>

<p>
The afternoon was waning, and Dimbie and I
were beginning to wake up and trying to
ignore the fact that Amelia was watching us through
the ever useful point of vantage, the pantry window,
when Professor Leighrail drifted through the gate,
round the broom bush, and stood staring at the
cottage.
</p>

<p>
That he hadn't seen us in the profound shade cast
by the apple tree was evident from his not too polite
remark addressed to the cottage&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Worse than I imagined&mdash;an overgrown pest-house!"
</p>

<p>
We laughed aloud, and he walked to us with
outstretched hands.  His dress attracted my immediate
attention, as it was a little unusual&mdash;black cloth
trousers, white linen coat, large, badly-fitting, brown
shoes with different coloured laces, and a top hat.
The last he removed with a flourish, and his first
observation seemed characteristic of the little I
knew of him.
</p>

<p>
"Guessed I should find you like this, still playing
at Romeo and Juliet, and you look," he put on a
pair of spectacles, "you look, seated against that
background of gnarled old branches, just as foolishly
sentimental and happy as any young couple <i>could</i>
look."  He did not wait for any reply, but rattled on.
"I found you without the slightest trouble.  I knew
I should."
</p>

<p>
"Pine Tree Valley is not a large&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," he interrupted, "but had it
been a town and not a village, I should have found
you just as easily.  I said to a villager&mdash;man in
corduroys&mdash;'Where is the residence of a lady and
gentleman who smile, who live on sunshine and
walk on air?'"
</p>

<p>
"And did he understand you?" we asked, determined
<i>not</i> to smile.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, I spoke quite clearly.  He reflected for
a moment, scratched his head, and said, 'First
turning to the right, One Tree Cottage.'  'That is
correct,' I said.  'One Tree Cottage is the foolish
and fantastic name they mentioned to me, now I
come to think of it.'  So you see here I am, and I
must say that you and your cottage are worse than
I anticipated."
</p>

<p>
"Worse!" Dimbie ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you and your wife are still at it, the
love-making.  I thought you would be getting over it by
now.  And your cottage&mdash;isn't it below the sea
level?  It looks to me as though it might have been
built on drained marsh land, originally a swamp."  He
spoke in the same cheerful, detached manner as
when he first scraped acquaintance with us in the
wood.
</p>

<p>
"We are two hundred feet above the level of the
sea," said Dimbie with as much pride as if he had
had a hand in the manufacture of the earth's
surface.  "A valley does not necessarily mean below
the sea level, as you must know."
</p>

<p>
The Professor laughed.
</p>

<p>
"But isn't it extremely damp and insanitary,
covered over with that weed?"
</p>

<p>
"That weed is clematis."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said the Professor.  "I should root it up,
all the same."
</p>

<p>
"But Marg&mdash;my wife and I almost took the
cottage on the strength of it."
</p>

<p>
"A foolish reason.  Did you look into your
drains, young man?"
</p>

<p>
"Amelia does that," I broke in.  "You know she
has a drain-bamboo."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I remember.  Very sensible of
Amelia, most sensible.  Where is she?"
</p>

<p>
"On the pantry table."
</p>

<p>
"A curious place to sit."
</p>

<p>
"She has the best view of us from there."
</p>

<p>
He smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I like servants to be interested in their master
and mistress."
</p>

<p>
"She is <i>very</i> interested in us," I said.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see this young person, and I
should like to see your drains.  Are they trapped?"
</p>

<p>
We both remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"I will have a look at them, if you don't mind."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie rose.
</p>

<p>
"No, I want Mrs. Smiling Face.  Women ought
to know more about the arrangements of their
homes than men."
</p>

<p>
He offered me his hand.
</p>

<p>
I looked helplessly at Dimbie.  It was so difficult
to speak, to tell him.  My voice still had an
annoying habit of breaking when I was trying my hardest
to refer to my&mdash;sorrow in a cheerful, careless
fashion.  The tears did not come, but&mdash;there was
always the break.  I would be telling Amelia she
might have my waterproof, as I should never
require it again.  I would start quite bravely, then
would come the catch.  Will it always be so, I
wonder?  Shall I never become quite calm and
indifferent?  It is eleven days since Dimbie came
home&mdash;a rich man&mdash;full of his good news.  Eleven
days he has spent with me, and never once have we
spoken of the cross we are called upon to bear, for
it is Dimbie's cross as much as mine.  Are we wise
to put it behind us thus?  Should we not feel it less
if we bravely discussed it?  And yet it is my doing.
It is I who willed it so, I who bade Dimbie never
to speak of it, and now I am almost sorry.  Somehow
it seems as though the silence makes it harder
to bear.  Our skeleton becomes more of a skeleton.
Perhaps if we were to discuss it freely, frankly, we
should begin to regard it in the same way as one
regards a smoky chimney&mdash;as tiresome, annoying,
but bearable if the windows are kept open to let
in the fresh air.  Our windows left wide would let
in a great deal of happiness&mdash;love, comradeship,
the pleasure of friends, the interest of books, the
everlasting joy of Nature.  I must ask Dimbie
what he thinks.  Dimbie always knows what is right.
</p>

<p>
In a few brief words he explained to Professor
Leighrail that I was a prisoner to my couch, and
that <i>he</i> must conduct him to the house.  The
Professor started as though to offer me words of
sympathy, and then stopped.  Simply taking my
hand in his he pressed it gently, and then followed
Dimbie into the house.
</p>

<p>
"That was nice of him," I thought.  "I wish
Nanty was here that they might renew their old
friendship.  Perhaps they&mdash;but no," I laughed,
"they are a little old, and&mdash;Nanty hates men."
</p>

<p>
Amelia bore down upon me with intense excitement.
</p>

<p>
"That gentleman has got his coat off, and he's
poking about the drains with <i>my</i> bamboo."
</p>

<p>
"It just shows how prepared you were for any
emergency, Amelia," I said sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
She looked at me out of the corner of her eye.
I never knew anyone's eyes capable of turning back
so far.  "Like a halibut's," I murmured.  They
instantly became straight.
</p>

<p>
"What did you say, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," I replied gently.  "I sometimes think
aloud."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, in a tone which suggested she
wished I wouldn't.
</p>

<p>
"Is he a sanitary inspector, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
"The gentleman who's doin' the drains."
</p>

<p>
"No, certainly not.  He's one of the greatest and
cleverest men in England, and&mdash;he killed his
mother."
</p>

<p>
Amelia looked incredulous.
</p>

<p>
"He'd have been hung if he'd done that,
mum&mdash;hung by the neck till he was dead."
</p>

<p>
My servant is painfully dramatic on occasions.
</p>

<p>
"It was an accident," I hastened to explain.  I
was afraid she might lock the Professor in the
cistern-room, or some other dark and unholy place.
"He was driving an aerodrome.  An aerodrome
is&mdash;&mdash;" but Amelia was not in the least interested
in my explanation.
</p>

<p>
"What's he examining the drains for?"
</p>

<p>
"He is afraid we shall be down with typhoid."
</p>

<p>
Amelia jumped into the air and dropped with a
thud on to her now decently flat-heeled shoes.
</p>

<p>
"Tompkinses' grandfather died of typhus."
</p>

<p>
"On the maternal side?" I asked affably.
</p>

<p>
She took no notice of my question.
</p>

<p>
"He lay for twelve weeks."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that was better than standing," I said.
She resumed her halibut-eyed expression,
and&mdash;left me.
</p>

<p>
Presently I heard her in strident-voiced conversation
with the Professor.  I could not hear what they
said, but they appeared to be very much in earnest.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie came out smiling.
</p>

<p>
"One is seated on the back kitchen table, and the
other is working away at the sink with the bamboo.
It seems a nasty job, but they appear to be very
happy."
</p>

<p>
"Which is doing the work?"
</p>

<p>
"Amelia.  The Professor wanted to, but she
snatched the implement from him."
</p>

<p>
"Well, are we to be down with typhoid, or is
there any chance of our escaping?"
</p>

<p>
Dimbie sat down.
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't know yet, but he is hoping for the
best.  He's a queer old cock, but I like him immensely."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," I agreed.  "I wish Nanty would come."
</p>

<p>
It very rarely happens that one's wishes are
instantly granted, but in this particular case my
fairy godmother was in a generous mood, for as I
spoke Nanty's carriage drew up at the gate, and
she swept down the path and across the lawn just as
the Professor emerged from the house brandishing
in his right hand the drain-bamboo.
</p>

<p>
Now that Nanty should, after a lapse of nearly
thirty years, meet her old friend Professor Leighrail
armed with a drain-bamboo would appear to be a
situation very far removed from romance.  But to
me it seemed a most delightful and natural
proceeding, for Nanty would no doubt remember that
her one time lover was, to say the least of it, a little
eccentric in his habits.  And Professor Leighrail
would equally remember that Nanty with her broad
outlook on life was not easily shocked.  Did I say
"broad outlook"?  I withdraw it, for Nanty with
her hard and narrow views of the genus man is
anything but broad in one respect.  Even her more
intimate knowledge of Dimbie has not converted
her, and Peter pronounces her as "pig-headed."
</p>

<p>
Anyway, her meeting with the Professor left her
quite calm and unruffled, while he, poor man,
because he <i>was</i> a man, mopped his brow and dropped
the bamboo on to the grass as though it had been a
live snake.
</p>

<p>
I had omitted to tell Dimbie of their former
relationship, and he now stood and stared at them
in the same way that Amelia stares at me when I
am gone, as she terms it, "a bit dotty."
</p>

<p>
Nanty dropped gracefully into a wicker basket-chair,
and settled her mauve taffeta gown comfortably
and elegantly.  The Professor with his big
shoes and linen coat cut a poor figure beside her.
</p>

<p>
"Nanty and Professor Leighrail used to know one
another," I explained to Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"It was a very long time ago, when we were
young.  I won't say how long, because the Professor
might not like it," said Nanty calmly.
</p>

<p>
Here was an opening for the Professor to say
something gallant, "That <i>she</i> was not altered in
the least, that only <i>he</i> had grown old," but he did
not take it.  The Professor is not a party man.  He
stared at the bamboo and said nothing.  Was he
thinking of the days when Nanty stood to him for
everything adorable in woman, or was he thinking
of his lost Amabella?  Can the woman you have
married entirely efface your memory of the other
woman you wished to marry?  And Nanty.  She
had started and seemed distressed when I told her
of the Professor's loneliness, of his unkempt
appearance.  She was downright cross when I mentioned
his ballooning, she had said it was a dangerous
game.  She had also said she had been a fool not
to marry him, and she supposed that he had grown
very fond of Amabella.  Now she sat sphinx-like,
with a little smile on her lips and her hands folded
on her lap.  The Professor might have been a casual
acquaintance she had met the day before.  I longed
for strength to get up and shake her.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie recognised that the Professor was in
trouble.  His embarrassment and awkwardness, not
to mention silence, were only too evident.  Manlike
he came to the help of man.  He plied him with
questions about the drains.  He did not understand
why the Professor <i>should</i> be awkward and embarrassed,
though vaguely he felt it had something to
do with the presence of Nanty; but whatever the
cause, he knew that the Professor required gentle
assistance, and to give this assistance he must get
him on one of his own pet subjects, either drains,
over-eating, or balloons.  He selected drains.  He
picked up the bamboo to attract the Professor's
attention, and asked him how long he gave us.
</p>

<p>
"Give you?" said the Professor, looking a little
dazed.
</p>

<p>
"Before we are down with typhoid."  Dimbie
was quite grave.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that depends on how much or how little
you flush your drains."  The Professor was equally
grave.
</p>

<p>
"What do you recommend us to use?"
</p>

<p>
"Condy's fluid, or any other good disinfectant."  The
Professor was now becoming interested.
</p>

<p>
"Chloride of lime is cheapest," chipped in Amelia
excitedly.  Under the pretext of rescuing her
drain-bamboo she had joined the party, and when I tried
to catch her eye to inform her that her services were
not required her eye steadily refused to be caught.
</p>

<p>
"Quite right," said the Professor, "chloride of
lime <i>is</i> the cheapest."
</p>

<p>
"Tompkinses always used it; their drains was
always beautiful, that sweet and fresh you could
have eaten your dinner in 'em."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie now tried to catch her eye, but she still
wouldn't be caught.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia," I said gently.
</p>

<p>
She became deaf as well as blind.
</p>

<p>
"The Tompkinses set a good example which all
householders might follow with great advantage to
themselves.  It is simply suicidal"&mdash;the Professor
had now quite forgotten Nanty&mdash;"it is simply
suicidal the manner in which they neglect their
drains, ignore their drains.  And their ignorance on
drains is usually colossal, only exceeded by the
ignorance and stupidity of the men who lay them.
I quite expected to find your main drain running
beneath your drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"You almost seem disappointed that it isn't," I said.
</p>

<p>
He smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where it is?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;o."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where your gas-meter is?"
</p>

<p>
"We haven't one, we use lamps and candles."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well, you wouldn't know if you had.  Women
never know these things."  He spoke despondently.
</p>

<p>
"I am not overwhelmed at our ignorance," I said
laughing.  "I don't see why we should know.
Surely the knowledge of gas and water is a man's
business?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not agree with you at all."  He spoke with
extreme rapidity.  "Women use them as much as
men, they should therefore understand something of
their working."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where the pearl buttons for your
flannel shirt are kept?" I asked quietly.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie suppressed a chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know I used them."
</p>

<p>
"How do you suppose your shirt remains fastened?
At the present moment the button on your
left wrist-band is cracked across the centre.  You
must replace it with a new one on your return home."
</p>

<p>
The Professor laughed good-humouredly.
</p>

<p>
"You had me there," he said.
</p>

<p>
"They always have us," quoth Dimbie.  "Haven't
you found it so?"
</p>

<p>
The Professor stole a sly glance at Nanty.
</p>

<p>
"Not always," he said softly.
</p>

<p>
He was evidently recovering from his embarrassment
by leaps and bounds.
</p>

<p>
A smile flickered across Nanty's lips.  She did not
return the look, but she unbent ever so little.
</p>

<p>
"What do <i>you</i> think of women, Professor?  You
have told us what you think about drains and
creeper-covered cottages, let us have your opinion
of the fair sex."  Dimbie looked wicked.  With
unusual perspicacity he smelt a rat, and now he
meant to run it to earth.
</p>

<p>
"What do I think of women!  I&mdash;I&mdash;" (the
Professor was now undoubtedly flurried) "I don't
think anything of them."
</p>

<p>
"That is a little rude and unkind of you," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, what?"
</p>

<p>
"That you should not think anything of them.
Are they so very unworthy?"
</p>

<p>
The poor man looked worried.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I think I must go now."
</p>

<p>
"No, don't go," I pleaded.  "Do stay to supper.
We do so want to hear your views upon women.
We so often hear them upon men" (I glanced at
Nanty) "that it will be quite refreshing to have a
change."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;what are the views you hear upon men?"  He
also looked at Nanty.
</p>

<p>
"That they are all bad."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;<i>I</i> think women are all good," at which
he bolted across the garden, called a good-bye,
raised his hat, and disappeared through the gate.
</p>

<p>
"That is the thinnest man I have ever seen,"
said Nanty somewhat unromantically.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think he gets enough to eat."
</p>

<p>
She started.
</p>

<p>
"Housekeepers are poor sort of creatures&mdash;selfish,
thoughtless, heartless," I generalised, not
having known one.
</p>

<p>
Nanty looked at the sweet-peas.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure he is often hungry."
</p>

<p>
She started again, and getting up from her seat
walked across the lawn and back to me.
</p>

<p>
"Where does he live?" she asked abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"The Grey House, Esher.  Why do you want to know?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;just curiosity."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you might ask him to tea?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"I don't ask men to tea," she said crossly,
picking up a newspaper and beginning to read.
</p>

<p>
"Visitors don't usually read."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!"
</p>

<p>
"While you read I'll think," and I fell into a
reverie, weaving many pleasant fancies, in which,
strange to say, Nanty and the Professor were always
the central figures.
</p>

<p>
By and by she looked up.
</p>

<p>
"Of what are you thinking and smiling?"
</p>

<p>
"Of&mdash;marriage and love."
</p>

<p>
"A foolish thought, and you cannot put the two
together."
</p>

<p>
"No?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>No</i>!" said Nanty decisively.

CHAPTER XXI
</h3>

<h4>
JANE FAIRBROTHER'S IMPENDING VISIT
</h4>

<p>
"All's right with the world."  The long-looked-for
letter from Miss Fairbrother has
arrived, and she is coming to stay with us.  I read
out the good news to Dimbie exultantly and most
happily:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"'LITTLE OLD PUPIL,&mdash;Shall I be glad to come
to you?  Why my pulses quicken at the very
thought, and my heart sings when I contemplate the
quiet joy of sitting in an English garden&mdash;a little
green garden under an apple tree with Marguerite
Westover.  Kipling says: "O the oont, O the oont,
O the Gawd-forsaken oont!"  But I cry, "O the
heat, O the heat, O the hellish, burning heat!" and
I conjure up before my sun-tired eyes a vision of
wondrous golden cornfields, ripening blackberries,
leaves turning to crimson and russet, dewy, hazy
mornings and over all the soft, mellow September
sunshine&mdash;for it will be September, that sweetest
of English months, when I arrive.
</p>

<p>
"'Everything I have to say to you must wait till
I am at One Tree Cottage.  Of your accident and
suffering I cannot write, but you will know&mdash;knowing
me a little&mdash;what I feel for you.  But take
heart.  Twelve months will not pass quickly at
your age.  Time tarries only for the young it would
seem, when for the old&mdash;who would have it linger&mdash;it
flies all too quickly.  But the months <i>will</i> pass.
Think, Marguerite, if it had been for life!'  (This
I did not read to Dimbie, I feared my voice, for it
still breaks.)  'As it is, you will get stronger each
month.  And then a day will come when I shall take
you for your first walk, if I am anywhere near you,
through the stately pine trees you loved so much
as a child.  Do you still love them?  But, ah, I
forgot&mdash;Mr. Dimbie will be there to take you.
There will always be a husband now, tiresome man!
Forgive me, but I want to step back to the dear old
days when I had my little pupil all to myself.
</p>

<p>
"Till the fifteenth of September good-bye.  I
shall, on reaching London, travel straight to Pine
Tree Valley.  It is so good of you to ask me, and
much <i>gooder</i> of your husband.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"'Always your affectionate,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'JANE FAIRBROTHER.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I smiled up at Dimbie, who was leaning over me,
but there was no response.  On his face there was
an expression I had never seen before.  He avoided
my eyes and walked across to the window.
</p>

<p>
"She seems a silly, sentimental woman," he
pronounced curtly.  "I can't bear people who
gush."  And he marched out of the room and shut the
door with a bang.
</p>

<p>
For a moment I wondered whatever was the
matter.  Then it dawned upon me that he was
jealous, and I laughed softly to myself.  "Dear
Dimbie, goose, that you should be jealous of anyone,
when I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;no use now, makes me absurdly
happy, ridiculously puffed up with pride and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dimbie was back.
</p>

<p>
"Will that woman have meals with us?"
</p>

<p>
"Where else could she have them?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't she have them in the kitchen with
Amelia?"
</p>

<p>
"With Amelia?  Miss Fairbrother is the daughter
of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care if she is the daughter of an
archbishop," he interrupted with extreme gloom.  "I
am not going to have her always messing round."
</p>

<p>
"She won't mess round.  Miss Fairbrother is not
that sort of person."
</p>

<p>
"You are prejudiced.  You see her through the
rose-coloured spectacles of time.  It is eight years
since you met.  Probably she has degenerated into a
prig."  He threw himself on to the bottom of the bed.
</p>

<p>
"Should I be mistaken in my estimation of Miss
Fairbrother, and she prove to be a prig, she shall
leave within a week.  I promise you that."
</p>

<p>
"How are you going to get rid of her?" He
spoke eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I <i>do</i> believe you hope she will be one."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't say that!"
</p>

<p>
"But you'll want her to go all the same?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he returned brazenly, "I shall.  She'll go
and spoil everything, I know.  I was a fool to
suggest her coming; but you seemed such dead
nuts on her.  Our pleasant afternoons in the garden
will be spoiled.  All our jolly talks and reading
aloud and suppers under the apple tree will be at
an end&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But she can have talks and supper under the
apple tree with us.  There'll be plenty of room for
three," I interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"And that's just what there won't be.  I'll see
to that," almost shouted Dimbie in a manner very
similar to Peter, I am ashamed to say.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to be rude to Miss Fairbrother?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, very rude."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then, I'll cable to stop her."
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going to cable&mdash;she sailed more
than a month ago&mdash;why she'll be here this week!"
springing up.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," I returned.  "Have you only just
found that out?  Amelia is already airing the best
drawn-thread linen sheets."
</p>

<p>
"Then what did you mean by saying you'd cable?"
</p>

<p>
"I meant I would wire on her arrival."
</p>

<p>
"But she said she was coming straight here.
You can't wire."  He groaned.  "Oh, Marg, Marg,
what <i>shall</i> we do?"
</p>

<p>
"Do?" I cried impatiently.  "You talk as though
Miss Fairbrother were a perfect gorgon, instead of
the sweetest and best woman in the world."
</p>

<p>
"That's just it."  He wiped his forehead.  "I
don't like best women; I like 'em ordinary.  In
fact, I don't like them at all&mdash;no one but you."
</p>

<p>
"That is exactly the way Peter talks."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care.  There are worse people in the
world than Peter.  Look what we're going to have
planked on to us for weeks&mdash;months even."
</p>

<p>
"Hand me my desk!" I commanded in a patient voice.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want it for?"
</p>

<p>
"To write a telegram form for Amelia to take at
once.  It will be given to Miss Fairbrother on the
boat when it arrives, I should imagine.  Anyway, I
will try it.  She must be stopped from coming at
any price."
</p>

<p>
"It's no good wiring till the boat is due."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know when it is due.  Please pass me
my desk."
</p>

<p>
"We'd better go through with it."
</p>

<p>
"Hand me my desk."
</p>

<p>
"Shan't!  Let the infernal woman come and be
done with it!"
</p>

<p>
With which exceedingly ungallant remark my
husband again stumped out of the room, and again
I lay and laughed and kissed the ugliest photo' of
him in my possession, for which I have an
unaccountable liking.
</p>

<p>
And so to-day I have lived more or less under a
cloud&mdash;a cloud in the shape of a lowering frown
on Dimbie's face.  But I care not.  I know most
assuredly that it will disappear as Jane Fairbrother
walks through the gate.  He will like Miss
Fairbrother, or Jane, as I always think of her now.
He will not be able to help it.  And into our days
Jane will bring outside interests, a fresh, breezy
atmosphere, new thoughts, new ideas, which I know
will be good for both of us.  Most fearful am I of
becoming a self-centred invalid, thinking of myself
only, of my ailments, of my weariness, of my
sometimes suffering.
</p>

<p>
And if I am afraid for myself, still more
desperately afraid am I of the <i>invalid</i> atmosphere for
Dimbie.  "It is not natural," my heart cries out,
"that a man young and strong should be the silent
witness of everlasting helplessness and weariness."  When
I am pretty well and able to be interested
in all that goes on around me, and can smile and be
happy, it matters not for him; but, oh, the days
when I am too tired to do anything but lie with my
eyes closed!  And the nights, the long, long nights,
when I am too restless to do anything but keep them
wide open; when my head tosses and moves restlessly
from one side of the pillow to the other, and
when I long with an unspeakable longing to be able
to move my helpless body in unison!  That is not
good for Dimbie to see; it cannot be good.  He will
stretch out strong, cool hands and gently lift me
on to my side, or turn my pillow, or hold a cooling
drink to my thirsty lips.  He will speak cheerfully,
he will even try to find a joking word; but, oh, the
heartache that must be his, the weary heartache!
And some day&mdash;as yet perhaps the burden is not
too heavy, the yoke not too galling, because out of
his great love for me he has learnt a great patience;
but will not the day come when the burden <i>will</i> be
too heavy, when he will falter or faint by the
wayside?  "O God, take me before that," I whisper
out of the darkness, "take me before he gets tired
of me!"
</p>

<p>
And so I look for the coming of Jane with a great
thankfulness.  The days in the garden, which I
have feared will become long and monotonous to
Dimbie, will be shared by one who, as I remember
her with her vivid personality, was always engaging
and interesting.  I have searched the papers for
the shipping intelligence, and for the date upon
which the good steamship <i>Irrawaddy</i> is due.  I have
looked up every possible train by which she could
come down to Pine Tree Valley.  The spare room,
Amelia tells me, is fit for the habitation of the Queen
of England.  And it <i>is</i> a pretty room, with its
Indian matting floor coverings, soft green walls
and rugs, wide, old-fashioned windows through
which a white rose peeps, and airy, silken casement
curtains.  It seems a long time since I was in that
room.  Some day, perhaps, if I should get stronger,
I will persuade Dimbie and Amelia to carry me
upstairs, and it will be like exploring a long-forgotten
country.  That Amelia has flattened every piece
of furniture (as much as you <i>can</i> flatten washstands
and wardrobes) against the walls I feel pretty
certain.  She objects to corners and pretty angles
disturbing her visual horizon.  She likes furniture
to be neat and orderly and placed like soldiers in a
row.  She looks at my bed, which I insist upon
having in the window, and sighs heavily.  I can see
her fingers itching to bang me up against the wall.
She suggests that I shall feel draughts and get a
stiff neck, be bitten by earwigs taking a walk from
the clematis which endeavours to climb through
the window, be sun-struck in the morning, moon-struck
at night, and be blown out of bed by the first
gale which comes along.  To all of which I say,
"I don't care, Amelia"; and she, figuratively
speaking, washes her hands of me, as sensible people do
wash their hands of silly, contrary creatures who
won't listen to reason.
</p>

<p>
Amelia really is no more pleased at the prospect
of Jane's visit than Dimbie, although she has so
thoroughly cleansed the spare room.  She talks to
me in this strain&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Miss Fairbrother's not going to dress you, mum?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not."
</p>

<p>
"And she won't be wanting to order the dinners?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure she won't.  Besides," with a sly
smile, "I thought <i>I</i> ordered the dinners."
</p>

<p>
Amelia considered this, and with the wisdom of
a diplomatist said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Of course you do, mum."
</p>

<p>
"I thought so," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
Amelia looked at me&mdash;one of the halibut looks&mdash;and
continued, "And I won't have her messing about
the kitchen."  Had she overheard Dimbie's remark?
</p>

<p>
"Miss Fairbrother would not dream of messing
about the kitchen.  Miss Fairbrother is not used
to kitchens and flue-brushes and 'sweetening'
ovens with lime."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course, if she's a grand lady!"  Amelia's
nose tilted in the air.
</p>

<p>
"She's not a grand lady; but her work in life has
lain in channels otherwise than kitchens.  She
teaches, she used to teach me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
I took up the paper.
</p>

<p>
"She can't know much, then!"
</p>

<p>
Now I am sure Amelia had no intention of being
in the least rude.
</p>

<p>
"That depends upon what you mean by much,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
She began to walk away.
</p>

<p>
Unaccountably I yearned to know her definition
of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think constitutes 'knowing much'?"
</p>

<p>
She looked at me without understanding.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by saying Miss Fairbrother
won't know much?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she won't."
</p>

<p>
"Granted that," I was becoming impatient, "but
what sort of things won't she know?"
</p>

<p>
"She'll know nothing useful."
</p>

<p>
"Amelia," I said despairingly, "if anyone can
walk round and round a circle you can."
</p>

<p>
She batted her eyes and regarded the ceiling in
complete vacancy.
</p>

<p>
Once again I tried.
</p>

<p>
"Will you tell me the things you consider not useful?"
</p>

<p>
"Lessons and maps and 'broidery work."
</p>

<p>
"Maps?"
</p>

<p>
"We was made to do maps in Mile End Road."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of maps?"
</p>

<p>
"Heurope in red paint."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you mean the British possessions?"
</p>

<p>
"That was it&mdash;America and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But America doesn't belong to us," I interrupted.
</p>

<p>
She closed her eyes in intense boredom, but I was
not to be snubbed.
</p>

<p>
"What do you call useful?"
</p>

<p>
"Gettin' bailiffs out of a house when they thinks
they's settled in."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I said.
</p>

<p>
"I've got two lots out."
</p>

<p>
"Was it at the Tompkinses'?" I whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Tompkinses was as respectable as you, mum,"
she said, mildly indignant.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I beg your&mdash;I mean the Tompkinses' pardon."
</p>

<p>
"They had salmon&mdash;lots of it."
</p>

<p>
"The bailiffs?"  I knew I had been stupid the
moment the words were uttered, but it was too late.
</p>

<p>
"I'm speaking of Tompkinses, mum."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you are."
</p>

<p>
"Why did you say bailiffs then?"
</p>

<p>
"A slip of the tongue."
</p>

<p>
Amelia with her eyes dared me to any more "slips."
</p>

<p>
"The Tompkinses had salmon twice a week and
manase once."
</p>

<p>
"Did it agree with them?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course it did.  <i>We</i> might afford salmon a bit
oftener now as we's rich before it goes out."
</p>

<p>
"Goes out where?"
</p>

<p>
"Goes out of season, of course," and this time she
left my presence with a most distinct snort.
</p>

<p>
Human nature is very much alike.  Dimbie is
cross about Miss Fairbrother's coming because he
thinks his nose with its dear crook will be put farther
out of joint.  Amelia is cross because she thinks <i>her</i>
nose will be put out of joint.  And I am sufficiently
human and feminine to derive considerable joy and
satisfaction from their anxiety about the putting out
of their said noses.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
</h3>

<h4>
A LITERARY LADY HONOURS ME WITH A VISIT
</h4>

<p>
On several different occasions of late has Amelia
had the pleasure of reaching out the best china
to a shrill accompaniment of "Now we shan't be
long," for the few select residents of Pine Tree
Valley have begun to call.  Six months have elapsed
since we came to live here.  Now it will not look like
"rushing at us."  Most of them are kindly, amiable,
well-meaning matrons, who seem sincerely sorry for
me, who have sent me books and magazines, and
who take an unfeigned interest in Amelia, her
management, and her singing.  "At any rate, she
has nice, respectable shoes now," I say to myself
with secret satisfaction.  And <i>she</i> is enjoying the
callers; she feels we are getting on.  She has hinted
at an "at home" day; she says I must buy Japanese
paper serviettes to lay on the ladies' laps; and that
rolled bread and butter is more correct than flat,
every-day bread and butter.
</p>

<p>
Of all my visitors only two stand out in my
memory with any distinctness: Mr. Brook, the vicar
of the parish, because he was a man, and
Mrs. Winderby, because she was literary.
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Brook walked through the gate Amelia
simultaneously flew out of the front door, and put
my slippers on to my feet with a smart action,
rescued the tortoise, and generally put me in order.
On reflection, I have decided that Amelia must
take up her position at the pantry window each
afternoon to lie in wait for callers.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brook's eyes twinkled as he watched Amelia's
efforts, and I liked him for the twinkle.
</p>

<p>
I remember more of Mrs. Winderby's conversation
than I do of that of Mr. Brook, for the latter was
not literary or nervous, or highly strung or jumpy,
he was just a plain clergyman.  I don't mean
plain-looking, but a man without frills or nonsense, a
kindly, breezy, broad-minded Christian gentleman
with a clean-shaven face and a cultured voice.  He
was apologetic for having been so long in calling, he
had been more or less ill for some months, and his
wife did not make calls without him; she was at the
seaside just now enjoying a well-earned rest.  He
was extremely sorry to hear of my illness; he hoped
I should soon be better; he had seen my husband at
church; and he consumed two muffins and four
cucumber sandwiches with his tea.
</p>

<p>
Tennyson's bad and unpoetical line in which he
burlesqued Wordsworth jumped into my mind:
"A Mr. Wilkinson, a clerygman."  That, I thought,
exactly described Mr. Brook; but I felt he would be
a good friend to those who were down on their luck.
</p>

<p>
I cannot dismiss Mrs. Winderby thus briefly, for
she still keeps edging into my thoughts in exactly
the same way as Amelia used to edge.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Winderby wore, as Amelia describes it, a
bed-gown, and her words were well chosen, for it
<i>was</i> a bed-gown.  The bed-gown was fashioned of
green velvet cut in a low square at the throat.  It
was supposed to hang in full, graceful folds, but it
didn't do any thing of the kind, for Mrs. Winderby
was of rounded, uncorseted, somewhat stout proportions,
so the poor bed-gown was tight and strained.
Around Mrs. Winderby's throat was a string of
amber beads; and her hair, which was red and
towsly, was surmounted by a green, untidy, floppy,
Liberty hat.
</p>

<p>
She sank on to the low wicker chair, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I have simply ached to know you ever since you
came to Pine Tree Valley."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I returned, unable to keep the surprise
out of my voice.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I know you have been here some
time; but, you see, I am always so <i>frantically</i> busy."
</p>

<p>
"Are people ever busy here?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"If they like to be," she pronounced; "it depends
on the people.  People who have resources of their
own are always busy.  <i>You</i> have resources."  She
pointed her parasol at me.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, have I?" I said, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"For you have a temperament."
</p>

<p>
Now I knew I had a temperature, but I didn't
exactly know what she meant by the other thing;
so I just laughed carelessly.  Had she said, "You
are of a sanguine or pessimistic temperament," I
should have quite understood; but to say in that
decided manner, "You have a temperament,"
simply nonplussed me.  And as she evidently knew
more about it than I, I didn't contradict her.
</p>

<p>
"I can see it in the colour of your gown, in the
books on your table&mdash;dear, darling <i>Omar</i>&mdash;in the
way you dress your hair."
</p>

<p>
She trod on Jumbles as she spoke.  Involuntarily
I put my hand to my head, but it felt all right.
</p>

<p>
"And this is such a sweet garden.  You live the
simple life, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"I live the life of an invalid," I replied; "it is
bound to be simple."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, of course.  I was told that you were
a sufferer&mdash;most distressing."
</p>

<p>
She spoke hurriedly, as though anxious to get
away from a painful subject.  Did she think that
I should dilate on my affliction to her?  God forbid!
</p>

<p>
"I had been so hoping that you would have been
one of us."
</p>

<p>
I looked at her, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"That you and your husband would have been
kindred spirits.  I thought I saw your husband as
I came through the gate?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that was my husband," I said steadily.
</p>

<p>
She looked about the garden, as though Dimbie
were concealed behind the sweet-pea hedge or
hidden among the rhubarb, and I had difficulty in
suppressing my laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Even if <i>you</i> are a prisoner&mdash;poor thing&mdash;perhaps
your husband would join our little coterie.
What is his bent?  What line does he take?"
</p>

<p>
Her conversation was mysterious, but here was
a plain, simple question easily understood.
</p>

<p>
"The South-Western he used to take," I said;
"but now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She eyed me a little coldly.
</p>

<p>
"I was not referring to railway lines," she
interrupted.  "I meant in what movement, art, thought,
work, is he specially interested?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," I said in confusion, "I beg your pardon.
I don't think there is anything very special.  My
husband is rather a lazy man.  He enjoys walking, and,
oh," I added with inspiration, "he likes gardening."
</p>

<p>
"Gardening has been overdone," she said firmly.
"Charming subject, communing with Nature and
all that sort of thing; but we have had Elizabeth,
Alfred Austin, Mrs. Earle, Dean Hole, and a host of
others."
</p>

<p>
"My husband does not commune with Nature,
he kills slugs," I retorted.  "Besides, none of the
people you have mentioned have gardened for us.
Elizabeth may fall into ecstasies of astonishment at
the unique sight of a crocus in bloom in February,
Alfred Austin may converse most charmingly with
his verbenas and lavender, but they don't know
where Dimbie has planted our celery."
</p>

<p>
She made a gesture of impatience.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem to understand me, but I will
endeavour to explain.  You see, a few of us here
have formed ourselves into a little band of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Musicians," I said pleasantly.  I was listening
to Amelia's rendering of "Now we shan't be long,"
and had not quite followed the gist of Mrs. Winderby's
conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I was not going to say 'musicians,'" she contradicted,
"though musical people <i>are</i> members of our
club.  We are literary&mdash;<i>I</i> am literary" (a
pause)&mdash;"artistic, scientific.  We have formed ourselves into
a club, and meet at each other's houses once a week."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds most interesting and improving," I
observed.  "I know a scientific man.  He invented
an aerodrome which killed his mother, and he goes
about in a balloon, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We only have gentlemen in our club."
</p>

<p>
"But he <i>is</i> a gentleman.  He is the great&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She leaned forward and stared at me intently.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" I asked, "an insect crawling
over me?"
</p>

<p>
"More than that."
</p>

<p>
"More than that!" I cried, nervously clutching
at my gown.  "Is it a wasp?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't get excited."  she murmured, leaning
still farther towards me.  "It is most interesting.
You have a cleft under your nose between your two
nostrils; it denotes extraordinary artistic sensibility."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," I said, "you are mistaken.  That
mark is the result of falling against a sharp-edged
fender as a child.  I thought it was practically
imperceptible.  My husband calls it a dimple.  I
am afraid I am not artistic in the sense you mean.
My husband and I are not very interesting.  We
are just every-day, ordinary people."
</p>

<p>
"And you are all the happier for that," she said,
lifting the hair from her forehead as if it were too
heavy.  "You ordinary people, as you call yourselves,
have the pull over us nervous, highly-strung,
thinking mortals.  Oh, the thoughts that burn in
my brain!  Sometimes I lie with my face pressed
to dear mother earth&mdash;I put my lips to the grass,
I murmur to her, I become one with her, and she
soothes and comforts me as a mother soothes a
tired child."
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily I pictured Mr. Winderby finding
his rather portly spouse in her green velvet bed-gown
rolling on the ground, and I smiled.  I pretended
that I was smiling at Amelia, who appeared with
an advance guard of Japanese serviettes, but
Mrs. Winderby detected my deceit.  She frowned and
rose.
</p>

<p>
At once I felt conscience-stricken.  Mrs. Winderby
was trying to entertain me, she had taken me into
her confidence, and here was I, a supercilious
invalid, laughing at her.  I felt really sorry.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go, Mrs. Winderby," I said pleadingly.
"Tea is coming, and I should like you to meet my
husband."
</p>

<p>
"Master's in the cock-loft," said Amelia, carrying
the three-decker cake-stand and placing it in front
of Mrs. Winderby.
</p>

<p>
"In the where?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"In the cock-loft."
</p>

<p>
"Wherever's that?"
</p>

<p>
"The cistern-room.  He's doin' photigraphs in
the dark."
</p>

<p>
Now I felt that Dimbie was acting very basely.
He had seen Mrs. Winderby coming through the
gate.  He had rapidly taken his bearings, and was
now in hiding in a cock-loft.
</p>

<p>
"Will you tell the master tea is ready, and that
I am anxious to introduce him to Mrs. Winderby,"
I said to Amelia.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mum."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Winderby sat down again appeased.  She
graciously accepted a cup of tea, which she said
must be just milk and water on account of her
nerves, and she skilfully brought round the
conversation to a man with a name which sounded like
a sneeze, whom I knew nothing about.  She talked
of him, quoted him, raved about him.  "He was a
dear, naughty philosopher, and his philosophy
drove him mad," she finished, and I covertly made
a note on the fly-leaf of a book which lay beside
me: "Niet or Ntiez, man who went mad."  I
intended looking him up in the encyclopædia.
Mrs. Winderby might call and talk of this sneezy
philosopher again, and I must know something
about him.
</p>

<p>
She detected me in my note-making.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I was only jotting something down."
</p>

<p>
"Your commonplace book? I presume.  Was
it something I said?  My friends do put down bits
of my conversation ready for copy."
</p>

<p>
She smoothed out her velvet gown with a plump,
white hand.
</p>

<p>
"Copy books?" I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," she retorted snappily.  "Copy
means matter for books&mdash;anything interesting or
amusing, that you hear and see.  Have you not met
any literary people?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I returned humbly.  "But Amelia&mdash;Amelia
is my maid&mdash;knew a poet in her last place;
he visited the Tompkinses."
</p>

<p>
"How interesting!  I wonder if she remembers
his name, and what he was like."
</p>

<p>
"I know what he was like," I said, delighted to
have interested her.  "Amelia described him to me.
He was like a garden leek that had been boiled
without soda&mdash;yellowish looking I suppose she
meant.  And a great friend of mine once knew
an authoress&mdash;a fifth edition, Marie Corelli sort
of writer&mdash;whose head was like a mangel-wurzel."
</p>

<p>
I began to feel more on an equality with
Mrs. Winderby.  Nanty's and Amelia's reflected glory
was raising my spirits.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I don't understand you," my visitor said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, because it was so&mdash;&mdash;" I stopped abruptly.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I remembered that Mrs. Winderby was
literary.
</p>

<p>
She looked at me coldly, she did not help me.
She saw my agitation, she watched the beads rise
on my forehead, and the only word I could think of
was "swelled."  I could not say swelled&mdash;it was
impossible to say swelled.  I hugged the tortoise,
and my slippers fell off.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I don't understand.  I cannot see
the connection between a mangel-wurzel and a
successful author," she repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Why because," I laughed feebly, "I&mdash;I&mdash;they&mdash;&mdash;"  And
Dimbie appeared from the cock-loft and saved me.
</p>

<p>
"Because they are both so nice," he said affably,
offering a hand to Mrs. Winderby and drawing up
a chair close to hers.
</p>

<p>
The situation was saved.  Dimbie was covered
with cobwebs.  His hands were dirty, but his
manners were irresistible; and that Mrs. Winderby
fell in love with him straight away gave me no
qualms of jealousy.
</p>

<p>
"It is so kind of you to come and call upon my
wife," he was saying.  "She is delighted to see any
of the residents of Pine Tree Valley."
</p>

<p>
Oh, Dimbie, Dimbie!
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Winderby gracefully crossed one velvet-clad
leg over the other.  She was prepared to
prolong her visit indefinitely now that Dimbie
had appeared.  Jumbles, giving her foot a wide
berth, crept on to the couch and snuggled down
beside me.
</p>

<p>
"I have been telling Mrs. Westover how much I
had been hoping that you would have been one of
us.  We are wanting new members."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Dimbie politely.
</p>

<p>
"We call ourselves the Sesameites."
</p>

<p>
It sounded so like a tribe of Israel that I wanted
to laugh, but Dimbie's face checked me.
</p>

<p>
"We are a little club for self-improvement.  We
exchange views, opinions, thoughts.  We help each
other like the&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Buffaloes," came a voice from the neighbourhood
of the couch, but it was certainly not mine.  It
belonged to Amelia, who stood behind me regarding
Mrs. Winderby with parted lips.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Amelia!</i>" I said.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Amelia!</i>" echoed Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"My brother's a buffalo," she said defiantly,
while turning a little red.  "I though p'r'aps he
belonged to the same club as this lady, as she says
it's to help one another.  You put in so much
money a week, and then when you's ill you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That will do," I said when I could get a word
in.  "You can remove the tray."
</p>

<p>
She walked unwillingly to the house, and we
turned apologetically to our guest.
</p>

<p>
"You were saying?" said Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I have lost the thread," she returned
gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it will come to you," he said hopefully.
"You were talking about the Simeonites."
</p>

<p>
"Sesameites," she corrected.
</p>

<p>
I pinched the tortoise quietly under the sofa
blanket.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, a sort of debating and literary society?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  <i>I</i> started it.  It was uphill work at
first, but I persevered.  And now we have an
extremely interesting number of members.  Some
of them are quite celebrities; for instance, it was I
who wrote <i>Winged White Moths</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Really?" said Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, dropping her eyelids.  "It took
a great deal out of me&mdash;I felt it all so intensely.  I
was quite exhausted when I had finished."
</p>

<p>
"How many editions?" I asked pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
She did not reply, perhaps she did not hear me,
anyway she did not reply.  She drew on her gloves
and said "Good-bye."  Dimbie conducted her to
the gate.  I could hear him entreating her to come
again, and she sounded a little more cheerful as she
went away.
</p>

<p>
When he came back he threw himself into a chair
and frowned at me.  I returned it with an engaging
smile, but he continued to frown.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't suit you because of your dear crooks,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
"We shall never have any friends, Marg, if you
behave like&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you want friends like that?" I interposed.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> don't, but I'm thinking of you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't," I said.  "I don't want any friends
like Mrs. Winderby.  I like clever, <i>really</i> clever
people, because they are usually unaffected and quite
simple, and can be interested in you and your doings
as well as in their own.  But Mrs. Winderby is
artificial, and she poses.  I don't like people who
pose.  I would infinitely prefer unclever, natural
women than posy ones.  Wouldn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"She was a bit of an affected ass, certainly."
</p>

<p>
"Some of the women who have called are very
nice&mdash;not violently interesting any more than I am,
but just kind and simple and straightforward.  I
like to know them, but I don't want to know Mrs. Winderby."
</p>

<p>
"And you shan't," said Dimbie, lighting his pipe.
"The next time she comes I'll throw her out of the
gate if you like."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Dimbie," I said, "one of your most engaging
qualities is that you so often see things from
my point of view.  Now some husbands would have
forced their wives to know that woman."
</p>

<p>
He laughed, then a tender expression crept into
his face.
</p>

<p>
"You see, you are not like most wives."
</p>

<p>
"I am not able to run away from disagreeable
people, you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I did not mean that."  A shadow now
superseded the tenderness.  "I meant that you were
so much more reasonable in your wishes than most
women."
</p>

<p>
I blew him a kiss.
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie, you are prejudiced.  What about my
selfishness in insisting upon remaining here when
you are aching to spend your money upon some
large establishment.  You are penned in, I know.
When I think that if we were away from here you
might get some shooting, riding, golf this autumn,
I am ashamed of my own selfishness.  But&mdash;it
won't be for long, that comforts me a little.  Not
for very long now."
</p>

<p>
"And then you are willing to go?" he said eagerly,
kneeling at the side of my couch.
</p>

<p>
"And then I shall be ready to go," I said gently,
hiding my face on his breast.
</p>

<p>
"Dear sweetheart!" he murmured, kissing my hair.
</p>

<p>
"Dear God," I said in my heart, "once again I
thank thee for Dimbie!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
</h3>

<h4>
I SURPRISE DOCTOR RENTON'S SECRET
</h4>

<p>
Very blind, very dense, and downright stupid
have I been; and being of the gender called
feminine, and presumably supposed to possess the
gift of scenting a love affair of even the most embryo
growth, I am all the more annoyed at my own
density.
</p>

<p>
Besides, Dr. Renton helped me.  The scent was
hot.  He mentioned India; he said she had lived
at Dorking, or am I imagining he said that?
Anyway, the trail was good, and it was only at five
o'clock this afternoon that I discovered that my
medical adviser, Dr. Renton, has been in love with
my old governess, Jane Fairbrother, for over ten
years.
</p>

<p>
And my discovery was only made by accident.
Had I been staring at Dimbie, as is my customary
fashion, instead of at Dr. Renton, when I announced
from the open telegram in my hand that Jane would
arrive on the morrow, I should not have seen the
red colour dye the Doctor's bronzed cheeks, and I
should still be wondering most probably who was
his long-loved and long-lost woman.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I said, blinded for the moment by my
sudden illumination.  "Oh!"
</p>

<p>
Our eyes met.  He smiled, and I knew that he
understood.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, nodding quietly.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie was balancing a piece of cake on Jumble's
nose.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," he said simply.
</p>

<p>
"What are you glad about?" asked Dimbie,
looking around.
</p>

<p>
"That the sun is coming out for Jane and
Dr. Renton after the long, long gloom."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie gazed at me.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why you should be specially glad
for them.  I think we require the sun much more
than they, as we are lazy people who lie about and
do nothing.  Besides, it has only been dull for three
or four days.  You can't expect this wonderful
summer to go on forever.  You've become exacting,
captious."
</p>

<p>
"It has been more or less dull for eight years,"
I remarked sententiously; and Dimbie, after again
staring at me, returned to Jumbles, as though cats
were easier to understand than women.
</p>

<p>
The Doctor and I smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I should wear grey flannel and a soft, grey
hat&mdash;grey goes so well with hair of the same colour,"
I observed.
</p>

<p>
"It's not very bad," he protested, putting his
hand to his hair.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty bad," I laughed; "there's a little brown
left, but it's mostly tinged with grey."
</p>

<p>
"And my tie?" he asked, with a funny and almost
resigned expression upon his face.
</p>

<p>
I put my head on one side to consider.
</p>

<p>
"Lavender would be&mdash;too bridal.  I think grey
or black and white."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever are you two talking about?" asked Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"Colours.  We were just considering what would
best suit a man with iron-grey hair."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not grey," said Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"No, dear."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I was just considering another man for the
moment.  Another man's appearance for an occasion
on which he is anxious to look unusually well
and young."
</p>

<p>
"He must be a conceited ass!" quoth Dimbie,
getting up and strolling after Jumbles, who with
arched back and stately tread marched away,
refusing to be turned into a common performing clown
at any man's bidding.
</p>

<p>
We laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
"May I&mdash;may I talk to you about it?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"When would you like to see her?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow evening if you'll let me."
</p>

<p>
I considered this.
</p>

<p>
"Say the day after."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because if&mdash;if she says 'Yes' she'll cease to
take any further interest in me.  I've grown selfish,
and I should so like to have her all to myself for
the first evening."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," he agreed somewhat grudgingly.
</p>

<p>
"You see, after waiting for eight years one day&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Will seem longer than the whole lot put together,"
he said despondently.
</p>

<p>
"Well, come late to-morrow night, after supper."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll try to hold out."  He smiled a little.
"If she&mdash;well, if she refuses me, I shall have had
all the longer blissful looking forward to meeting
her again.  And if she should say 'No' it will serve
me right."
</p>

<p>
"I somehow don't think she'll refuse you, though,
as you say, it would certainly serve you right."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know it would."  In his eyes lay an
anxious, almost wistful look, which touched me.
His rugged face had softened to a semblance of
youth, his voice was less gruff.
</p>

<p>
"Women don't forget easily.  If she ever cared
for you&mdash;&mdash;" I began.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie was returning.
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie," I called, "you might climb over into
the frog-pond field and bring me some marguerites."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't they over?"
</p>

<p>
"If they are bring me some loosestrife and,
scabious and anything you can find.  I long for
some wild-flowers."
</p>

<p>
Lazily he threw a leg over the fence and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"He'll be away some time now.  Dimbie never
does anything quickly; he is slow and thorough,
and he will endeavour to find the largest daisies in
the field."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose when I&mdash;if I were ever married my
wife"&mdash;he stumbled over the words&mdash;"might ask
me to pick daisies for her?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps.  But a great deal depends upon the
man.  I cannot imagine my father picking flowers
for mother; he would more likely throw them at her."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Renton smiled.  He had known Peter as long as I.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder whether you will find Miss Fairbrother
much changed?  She is eight years older, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," he said placidly.
</p>

<p>
"Women age as well as men."
</p>

<p>
"Naturally."
</p>

<p>
"You don't care?"
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't mind if she looks older?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not.  No man <i>wants</i> his wife to look
old, but if she does he loves her none the less.  I
have not been married, but I know this is so.  I
have seen the most beautiful affection between quite
old men and women.  It is not passion, but a love
that has been tried in the fire and emerged triumphant."
</p>

<p>
I gave a sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
"Besides, I know Jane's is a face that will have
become more beautiful with the years."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"You will remember that her mouth was firm,
almost hard?  Her clear eyes honest, but almost
defiant?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"Well, they were.  Perhaps I studied her features
more carefully than you."
</p>

<p>
"Possibly," I said, a little dryly.
</p>

<p>
"She had had to fight her own battles.  She had
had to stand up for herself against the world.  Her
childhood had been sad&mdash;an invalid mother, a
drunken father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Once she told me all about it.  We were
alone, and she gave me her confidence.  And&mdash;I
was fool enough to let that moment pass, though
every bit of my being cried out to me to speak to
her, tell of my love.  But I thought she wasn't
ready, and then she went away.  But, as I was
saying, I know she will be more beautiful now,
Hers was a large nature.  The years will have
brought her a tenderness and sympathy which will
have written themselves on the lines of her face.
Some lined faces, with their experience, are
infinitely more attractive than the fresh, smooth faces
of youth.  Don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded.  For the first time in my life I was
learning that the Doctor had another side to his
character.  He had thrown aside his cloak of reserve,
his professional manner, and I feared lest a chance
word of mine might cause him to withdraw into his
shell.
</p>

<p>
"In some faces you will see written the history
of their owners' lives, dispositions, characters, if you
look carefully.  Note the little lines around the eyes
that star away in all directions.  They mean that
the person who possesses them has smiled much,
laughed at misfortune, helped the world to be the
brighter and better for his or her presence.  I
expect to see those lines around Jane's eyes, and if
they are not there I shall almost be disappointed."
</p>

<p>
He fell into a reverie, and I looked at him
thoughtfully.  He would make Jane very happy.  "Oh, I
hope she'll have him, I hope she'll have him!" I
whispered again and again to myself.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie appeared over the fence.
</p>

<p>
"Will those do?" he asked, putting into my
hand an enormous bunch of wild-flowers.
</p>

<p>
I buried my face in their fresh sweetness.
</p>

<p>
"We will put them in Jane's room; she loves
flowers."
</p>

<p>
"You will not put them in Jane's room," contradicted
Dimbie crossly.  "I don't gather flowers
for every strange woman from India, please
understand that, Marguerite."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Renton looked up in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have to speak like that.  Marguerite will
make a perfect fool of Miss Fairbrother if I let her
have her way.  It's Miss Fairbrother this and Miss
Fairbrother that.  I'm sick of the very name of the
woman.  I'll take jolly good care that she is out of
this house in less than a fortnight.  Marguerite
asked her for an <i>in</i>definite period, but it happens to
be very definite in my mind."  With which he flung
himself across the lawn and into the house.
</p>

<p>
The Doctor opened his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Don't take any notice," I said quickly, for I
knew Dimbie was watching us through the drawing-room
window, "it's only jealousy, nothing more;
he'll be all right when she comes."
</p>

<p>
"I'll marry her at once," the Doctor pronounced,
getting up from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"You forget that she may not accept you."
</p>

<p>
He blushed a little.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," he said gruffly.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," I laughed; "but you might tell me
before you go whether you think I am any better or
worse.  You'll remember you came over to see
me&mdash;perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
He couldn't help laughing too.
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully sorry.  You see, the telegram came
just after my arrival."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be, there's nothing fresh to report."
</p>

<p>
"Still tired?" he asked very gently.
</p>

<p>
"Still tired and waiting for a fresh breeze to blow.
I think I shall be better then, Doctor."
</p>

<p>
"God grant that it may be so."  He raised my
hand to his lips.  "You are a staunch friend,
Marguerite."
</p>

<p>
"Take care," I said, my eyes suddenly filling,
"Dimbie is watching, and he is in a bit of a temper.
You will be coming on Thursday, and good luck to you."
</p>

<p>
When he had driven away Dimbie sauntered
across the grass.
</p>

<p>
"What is that man kissing you for?"
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie," I said, "you are too comical for words,
and I will return your question with another.  What
is the matter with you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."  He lay down on the grass and
leaned his head against my couch.  "I'm cross,
I think, Marg."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I returned, running my fingers through
his wavy hair, "you're very cross.  How long do
you think you will continue to be so?"
</p>

<p>
"Till Miss Fairbrother has gone.  Marg, I don't
want to be a surly beast, but, oh, I do wish I had
never consented to that Indian woman's coming."
</p>

<p>
"If I tell you something will you promise to keep
it secret&mdash;either till the day after to-morrow,
Thursday, or forever?"
</p>

<p>
"There's rather a wide difference between the
two periods of time."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but there is a reason for it.  Will you
promise?"
</p>

<p>
"All right."
</p>

<p>
"I mean a faithful promise.  You have a rather
trying habit of slipping things out.  This must be
an on-my-oath promise."
</p>

<p>
"On-my-oath, world-without-end promise,"
repeated Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Renton wishes to marry Jane Fairbrother."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce he does!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, enjoying his astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"But he doesn't know her."
</p>

<p>
"He has known her for years.  He knew her when
she lived with us, but she went to India before he
could make up his mind to speak to her.  Now he
is coming on Thursday."
</p>

<p>
"And he will take her away just when she is
going to be useful to us, selfish beast!"
</p>

<p>
I smiled behind my hand.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Dimbie," I said, "I always thought men
the most <i>contrary</i> creatures, having lived under
Peter's roof for some years, but never <i>quite</i> so
contrary as I now find them to be."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean that here you have been making yourself
extremely disagreeable about Miss Fairbrother's
visit, and the moment someone comes along and says
he will remove the incubus you turn equally nasty."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want <i>you</i> to be disappointed.  For myself,
I am only too jolly thankful that she won't be
here long."
</p>

<p>
"But she may.  I am not sure that she will
accept Dr. Renton."
</p>

<p>
"I am."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Most women accept the first man who asks 'em."
</p>

<p>
I swelled with indignation, and I rang the tortoise
to emphasise my righteous anger.
</p>

<p>
"The conversation is finished," I said.
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't," contradicted Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"I repeat that it is."  I shut my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You've beautiful eyelashes&mdash;look like a fringe
on your cheeks, and they all curl up at the ends,
Marg."
</p>

<p>
An interval of silence.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't say <i>you</i> would rush at a man.  I meant
most women."
</p>

<p>
More silence.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think I'm right?"
</p>

<p>
"Your ignorance of women is only equalled by
your colossal conceit.  The conversation, I again
repeat, is at an end."
</p>

<p>
"And once again I assert that it isn't.  I wish to
discuss the matrimonial prospects of Dr. Renton
and Miss Fairbrother."
</p>

<p>
"You must discuss them with yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Can't."
</p>

<p>
"You must take back what you said."
</p>

<p>
"Shan't."
</p>

<p>
I closed my eyes tightly.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go and talk about them to Amelia."
</p>

<p>
He got up.
</p>

<p>
"You dare!"
</p>

<p>
"I shall."
</p>

<p>
"You promised.  You can't break your word."
</p>

<p>
"It would be quite easy."
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie, I never thought you <i>could</i> descend to
such meanness."
</p>

<p>
"You see how little you knew me."
</p>

<p>
"Women are always deceived."
</p>

<p>
"It's funny how they rush at marriage."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," I cried, "you are too dreadful!  Go
away at once."
</p>

<p>
He laughed and croodled closer to the couch.
</p>

<p>
"This is our last afternoon," he said ingratiatingly,
looking up into my face.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Before the she-dragon comes.  Be nice to me, wife."
</p>

<p>
I looked away.  It is hard to resist the plead
in Dimbie's eyes and the crook of his mouth.  His
hand stole into mine.  I took no notice.  The other
hand stroked my hair the wrong way, and&mdash;then,
after the manner of fond, foolish woman, I forgave
him and was nice.

CHAPTER XXIV
</h3>

<h4>
MUSINGS ON AUTUMN AND THE ARRIVAL OF JANE
</h4>

<p>
One of those September days is with us in
which the world, like Rip Van Winkle, is
very fast asleep.  A great stillness broods o'er our
little garden.  No blade of grass or leaf of tree
moves or rustles to disturb the silence.  Jumbles
lies curled upon the warm front doorstep; Dimbie
lies asleep in a low hammock chair.  The birds and
insects, and even the ants, have joined in the general
siesta; and I, generally having more time than the
others in which to indulge in flights to the land of
Nod, am keeping awake to take care of all my friends
of the garden.  I have to keep removing a fly from
Dimbie's nose; to see that Jumbles doesn't wake up
suddenly and pounce upon a drowsy, unwary bird
in the neighbourhood of the broom bush; and to
turn an eye upon a butterfly which appears to have
fallen asleep in the heart of a single dahlia.
</p>

<p>
Over all broods a haze, gossamer and fairy-light,
but still a haze which ever follows in the footsteps
of sweet September&mdash;September so quiet, so peaceful,
so mellow and rounded.  September is to May
as mature and still beautiful womanhood is to the
freshness of girlhood, not so radiant, but so
complete, so satisfyingly lovely.  Spring somehow, I
know not why, gives me an ache at the heart, creates
within me a yearning for something.  Autumn does
not affect me thus.  There may be a regret, a
glance of retrospection at the months which are
gone&mdash;the beautiful, bountiful summer months&mdash;but
the ache has vanished, the yearning has departed.
</p>

<p>
Is it that September, herself the most peaceful
of all the months, bears in her arms a gift for
Nature's truly loving and understanding children&mdash;the
gift of peace, a peace which passeth all
understanding?  Lately it has come to me, this peace,
and I smile happily, hugging it to my heart.  All
the anguish of the last weeks&mdash;the bitter tears, the
pining for movement, the unutterable yearning to
be out in the wind, by the sea, on the mountains&mdash;has
left me.  I am content to lie in my little garden,
to be still, to commune with myself, and to know
that Dimbie is there.
</p>

<p>
And&mdash;I am reading a Book, one that I read as
a child, as a girl, and now as a woman.  I am
a woman now, for I know the meaning of the
word suffering.  In the old days I read this Book
as one reads a lesson&mdash;dull, uninteresting, I thought
it.  I chafed at the chapter which Miss Fairbrother
obliged me to read each day.  Some parts struck
me as being duller than others.  There was the
tiresome description of the building of the temple,
and the bells and pomegranates&mdash;pomygranates I
used to call them&mdash;and the fourscore cubit this
and the fourscore cubit that.  Miss Fairbrother
would endeavour to make it interesting, but I was
unmistakably bored.  But now&mdash;-it seems curious
that I should have ever thought it dull.  I read it
with deep intensity.  I know as I turn the pages
what is coming, but yet it is all new to me, a new
meaning falls upon my understanding.  And there
are three words from this Book which of late have
continually danced before my eyes.  I have seen them
written on the sky, on the grass, on the pages of my
book.  I have heard the wind whisper them, the
flowers repeat them, the leaves pass on the refrain to
the waving corn, and yet I alone have been unable to
say or believe them.  The words have stuck in my
throat, my dry lips have refused to form them.
And then a night came when I saw them written on
Dimbie's face.  He had been depressed, and had
taken his sorrow to the pine woods, and when he
returned a gladness irradiated his countenance, and
on his forehead, as it seemed to me, were the words,
written in letters of gold, "God is Love!  God is
Love!"  I repeated them mechanically to myself
over and over again; and suddenly the mists cleared
away, the fog dispersed, and I too cried, with a
great sincerity and gladness, "God is Love!"
</p>

<p>
/tb
</p>

<p>
Jane came softly down the walk and with finger
to lip bade me be silent.
</p>

<p>
"I want to love and kiss you, little old pupil,
without any jealous eye to mar my happiness.
And I also want to have a good look at your husband."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie lay with head thrown back, giving to the
garden a music that was not of the sweetest.
</p>

<p>
"He is not at his best," I whispered; "his mouth
isn't always like that."
</p>

<p>
Jane made a comical little <i>moue</i> and kissed me
again.  "The same old Marguerite," and she framed
my face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
"With a difference," I said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"With a beautiful difference.  I don't wonder at
your husband's falling&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" I said, "I am going to wake him."
</p>

<p>
Jane sat down and watched with interest.
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie!  Dimbie, dear, would you mind waking up?"
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't always sleep quite so heavily as this,"
I explained apologetically.  "It has been such a
warm, enervating day."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Dimbie</i>, will you stop snoring."
</p>

<p>
Still no answer.
</p>

<p>
Loudly I rang the tortoise, and he was on his
feet in an instant, blinkingly staring at Jane.
</p>

<p>
"It's not a fire or an accident," I said; "it's
Miss Fairbrother."
</p>

<p>
With the first of Jane's wholesome, heartsome
smiles I knew that his conquest had begun.  They
shook hands, and he apologised for being caught in
such an attitude.
</p>

<p>
"It enabled me to have a good look at Marguerite's
husband, of whom I have heard so much,"
said Jane frankly.
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think of him?" Dimbie asked
with a twinkle.
</p>

<p>
"I must reserve my judgment till later.  It may
be a case of cruelty, desertion, and wife beating.
Appearances are so deceitful.  And no faith should
be placed in a young wife's estimate of her husband."
</p>

<p>
He pushed his hammock chair towards her.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you take this; it is more comfortable.
And were Marg's letters very tiresome?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she didn't say much about you."  Jane
wore an air of "May God forgive me!"  "But what
little she did write of you was mostly to the good."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie laughed, and began to enjoy himself.
</p>

<p>
"Before you begin to talk," I said, "would you
like a wash or have tea first?"
</p>

<p>
"Tea, please."
</p>

<p>
I rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite anxious to see the young person with
the tea-rose slippers," observed Jane, removing her
hat and running her fingers through her soft,
luxuriant hair, which was parted on one side.
</p>

<p>
"She doesn't wear them now.  We have had a
lot of money left us," I said, studying the expressive
face in front of me, which had changed so little.
</p>

<p>
"Does she run about barefoot?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  What I mean is that we can afford
now to give her nice, kid slippers."  I struggled to
keep my mind on Amelia, and not on Jane's pretty,
cool, grey linen gown which was inset with beautiful,
Irish crochet lace.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't mercerised cotton," I thought aloud.
</p>

<p>
"It's one of my best frocks," said Jane, following
my eyes.  "Do you think it suitable for my years,
Marguerite?"
</p>

<p>
"I should wear it to-morrow," I said impulsively,
and then stopped awkwardly.
</p>

<p>
"Why to-morrow?" she asked in surprise.  "Are
you having a party?"
</p>

<p>
"Only Marg's medical m&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie," I shouted, "will you go and see if
tea is ready?  I can't think what Amelia can be
doing."  I looked at him feverishly.  He sat
open-mouthed for a moment, and then he remembered,
nodded his head, and set off to the house with a
run.  I could see from Jane's expression that she
thought we were very odd people.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;what do you think of the sunflowers?"
I asked jerkily.
</p>

<p>
"I think they appear to be very handsome,
self-respecting sunflowers," she replied.
</p>

<p>
There was an interval of silence.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Marguerite?" she asked at
length.  "The atmosphere is charged with a
mysterious something which I cannot understand."
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you on Thursday."
</p>

<p>
"On Thursday?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Oh, here is Amelia with tea!  This is
Amelia."
</p>

<p>
Jane gave her a smile, showing her even, white
teeth.  This was returned by a look of hostility.
Amelia was not to be won by any smile.  She was
not a weak man, and she prided herself on her
even balance.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon," said Jane.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon," said Amelia in a tone of "Go
to perdition with you!"
</p>

<p>
But Jane had no intention of doing so, at any
rate, till she had had some tea.  She handed some
money to Amelia.
</p>

<p>
"Will you be good enough to give this to the
man who is bringing my trunks along?"
</p>

<p>
"Were there no cabs?  Most people takes cabs."  Now
she was being distinctly impertinent.  I felt
very angry with her.
</p>

<p>
"Please do as you are told," I said wrathfully,
"and without comment."
</p>

<p>
She was, for the first time since she had been in
my service, impressed by my anger, and at once she
changed her tactics.
</p>

<p>
"The day would be hot I was thinkin' for Miss
Fairbrother to walk."
</p>

<p>
"You were thinking nothing of the kind.  Stick
to the truth."  And to my consternation she
immediately did as she was told and stuck to it.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want no visitors."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Amelia!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Jane laughed unconcernedly.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't either," she said, looking at Amelia
in a most friendly manner.  "I quite sympathise
with you.  You think I am going to meddle and
interfere?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"You think I am going to poke into the kitchen
and do things for your mistress that you have been
in the habit of doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Amelia, surprised at Jane's intuition.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you may make your mind quite easy on that
score.  To begin with, I am far too lazy to interfere.
I like people to work for me if they will.  And I
think it would be a mean thing to do when you have
served Mrs. Westover so faithfully and lovingly.  I
shall not usurp your place."  Jane's voice was most
gentle now, full of sympathy and kindliness.  "But
if you will allow me, I will help you with my bed
and dust my room.  I shall make a little extra work,
of course, and I am sure you must have a great deal
to do."
</p>

<p>
Amelia wavered, rocked about with indecision for
a moment, and was won.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, miss, it's very good of you," was all
she seemed able to say.  And as a relief to her
feelings she slapped the tortoise, picked up Jane's
gloves from the ground and returned to her kitchen.
</p>

<p>
"Tea is going cold," said Dimbie.  "First game
of the rubber to Miss Fairbrother."
</p>

<p>
"You don't say the rubber, I notice," observed Jane.
</p>

<p>
"I know Amelia."
</p>

<p>
"I fancy though, without any undue conceit,
that I shall win.  I like that girl."
</p>

<p>
"So do we, but that doesn't give us the power
of managing her."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to manage her.  My simple desire
is that she shouldn't manage me, and will permit me
to remain with you for a short time."
</p>

<p>
"You shall certainly do that," said Dimbie.
"Marg has been counting the days to your coming."
</p>

<p>
"And you?" she asked slyly.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I have been doing likewise," said my
husband brazenly.
</p>

<p>
She laughed, a merry, incredulous laugh.
</p>

<p>
"And yet I fancied I had two rubbers to play
and hoped to win."
</p>

<p>
"Really?" said Dimbie.  "Only one as far as I
know, and the first game is already yours."
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind," she said simply.  "I
understand, and am grateful.  I did so want to see
Marguerite again."
</p>

<p>
"You could not be more grateful than I am for
your coming," he returned earnestly.  "The thanks
are on our side."  And I knew he meant it.
</p>

<p>
"A rubber and a half for Jane," I whispered to
the tortoise.  And I stretched out a hand and held
Dimbie's closely in mine.

CHAPTER XXV
</h3>

<h4>
AN ENGAGEMENT, AND I TELL JANE MY STORY
</h4>

<p>
The two of them came down the garden path
hand in hand.  The sun caressed Jane's
small, dark head.  She wore the pretty, cool, grey
gown, and in her belt was tucked a red rose no
redder than her cheeks.  They stopped in front of
the couch, and I held out my hands to them.
</p>

<p>
"I know," I said.  "You needn't tell me.  I'm
so glad.  You two dear things.  It is beautiful,
and&mdash;I like your suit, Dr. Renton; my sartorial instinct
is good, I think."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it was the suit&mdash;altogether, but
perhaps I'm vain."  He looked gravely at Jane.
</p>

<p>
She was a little mystified.
</p>

<p>
"I was telling Dr. Renton the other day that I
considered grey flannel was very becoming to men
with grey hair."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, "I didn't notice what he was wearing."
</p>

<p>
"There!" said the Doctor.
</p>

<p>
"I don't feel abashed.  Unconsciously she would
take in the general effect."
</p>

<p>
Jane wandered to the sweet-pea hedge and
hummed a little tune.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like a conversation conducted in asides,"
she called.  "When you two have finished tell me."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Renton regarded her with pride and love
written on every line of his face.
</p>

<p>
"You see, she has grown beautiful!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  Don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, no.  I haven't thought so; but I will look
more closely.  Are the lines there?"
</p>

<p>
"A few, but not so many as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You had expected?"
</p>

<p>
"As I had hoped," he finished with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Jane," I called, "the Doctor is disappointed not
to find you wrinkled."
</p>

<p>
"Did he wish me to keep him in countenance?"
</p>

<p>
"Jane, you must learn to be respectful.  The
Doctor is older than you."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot learn such a lesson at my time of life.
My pupils have respected <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be your master, not your pupil."
</p>

<p>
"These are early days to adopt such a tone, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You might both be in your teens," I observed.
And they laughed as happily as though they were.
</p>

<p>
A hammering at the drawing-room window
attracted our attention.
</p>

<p>
"It's Dimbie," I explained.  "You see, he is a
little cross.  He went to look up something for me
in the encyclopædia, and I told Amelia to lock him
in.  I was afraid he might worry you, and perhaps
follow you about."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say he knew&mdash;&mdash;" Jane broke
off, turning a vivid scarlet.
</p>

<p>
What was I to say?  Here was a pretty dilemma.
</p>

<p>
"I let it out the other day," said the Doctor bravely.
</p>

<p>
"Did you know when you invited me here?"  Her
eyes were full of fire, but her voice was quiet.
</p>

<p>
"No," I said triumphantly, "not a word.  And
Dr. Renton didn't exactly tell me; I found out.
He was here when your telegram came."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Westover will certainly break the window,"
she said, somewhat inconsequently.
</p>

<p>
He was waving and war-whooping like an Indian.
Amelia came to the door.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I let him out now, mum?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"At <i>once</i>."
</p>

<p>
When he appeared I said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie, you should try to be more controlled."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of all the cheek&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't cheek, but common sense," I
interposed gently.  "I told Amelia to do it."
</p>

<p>
"But why?  You may be the mistress of One
Tree Cottage, but <i>I</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come here, and I will whisper to you."  I pulled
his sunburnt face down to mine.
</p>

<p>
"Your hair tickles!"  He was still a little cross.
I pushed it back.
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid you might follow those two about
and stare at them, and I wanted them to get
engaged and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dimbie raised his head.  (Jane, followed by the
Doctor, had strolled away.)  Light broke across
his face.
</p>

<p>
"And they've done it?"
</p>

<p>
"It is not an elegant way of putting it."
</p>

<p>
"They've been jolly sharp."
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Renton has been here over half an hour."
</p>

<p>
"And where have I been?"
</p>

<p>
"Studying the encyclopædia.  Don't you remember
I asked you to find me the sneezy man?  Who
was he?"
</p>

<p>
"Nietzsche, a bally German who didn't know
what he wanted."
</p>

<p>
He crossed the lawn, and I noticed that the grip
he gave the Doctor's hand was pretty severe.  To
Jane I heard him say: "It's made Marg awfully
happy.  Her eyes are shining, and she thinks she
has brought it all about&mdash;a regular match-maker!"
</p>

<p>
I could not catch Jane's reply, but presently they
returned to me.
</p>

<p>
"You will be wanting to walk and wander down
the lanes, as Dimbie and&mdash;as all lovers want to
wander, and you shall go at once.  The evening
is lovely.  There is a cornfield in the lane after you
have passed the four cross-roads.  Dimbie has told
me of it.  The sun is setting&mdash;sun on a golden
cornfield is a thing of beauty&mdash;and later there will
be a moon.  Please remember that supper is at
eight o'clock."
</p>

<p>
They laughed, and Jane without any more ado
put on her hat.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me," observed Dimbie, as our eyes
followed them round the broom bush and through
the gate, "that they are a little old for the game."
</p>

<p>
"That is so like a man who never knows or
understands anything."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" He settled himself in a deck-chair and
lighted his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"You see, the hearts of Jane and the Doctor are
still quite fresh and young."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "love has kept them so.  As they
walk down the lane they are back in their 'twenties.'  The
years have slipped away.  What matters if
their faces are tired, if some of the brightness has
gone out of their eyes, if some of the freshness has
left their voices?  They are beautiful to each other,
that is sufficient."
</p>

<p>
"You sound very wise, little wife."
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I am wiser than you in a few things because I
am a girl.  Only women understand that which
pertaineth to love.  Men are very ignorant."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie smiled and smoked for a while in silence,
while I thought of the happiness of Jane.  We had
had a long and intimate talk the previous evening.
Dimbie had left us and gone to the fields in search
of mushrooms at my special request.  Mushrooms,
I had felt, were the one thing needed to complete
our evening in the garden, for we were to sup under
the apple tree; and Dimbie on his return was to
hang out our Chinese lanterns and dot fairy lights
about the lawn.
</p>

<p>
"You only want to get rid of me," he had laughed.
"I am convinced that there will not be a single
mushroom in Surrey after the long, dry summer."
</p>

<p>
"If I want to get rid of you," I returned, "it will
be for the very first and last time in my life; but I
want to talk to Jane for a little while&mdash;just by ourselves."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me for a moment jealously and
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mind just for once, dear."
</p>

<p>
"No, not very much, though I don't approve of
secrets between women."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," I said, patting his cheek, "and bring
plenty of mushrooms."
</p>

<p>
Jane sat on a low chair with her arms pillowed
behind her head.
</p>

<p>
"Now," she said, "tell me all, tell me your story
from the very beginning.  You have suffered much,
I can see it in your face, but you are happy.  Tell
me where you met your husband.  I may say at
once that I like him tremendously."
</p>

<p>
"Jane," I said, "my heart goes out to you at
your words.  To like Dimbie shows that you possess
a fine discrimination."
</p>

<p>
She smiled and said, "I am waiting."
</p>

<p>
And so in the gentle hush of evening, in the fading
light, in the sweet fragrance of the garden, I told
her all.  Of Dimbie's and my first meeting, of our
engagement, of our marriage, of my great happiness
&mdash;I lingered on that.  The pain which had been
mine when I recalled those radiant days had gone.
I could speak of them now calmly and without any
break in my voice.  Those were days pulsating with
joy, these were days of a great peace.  Then briefly
I touched upon my accident and suffering, of our
hopes only to be dashed to the ground, of my
subsequent despair, of my doubts as to the steadfastness
of Dimbie's love, followed by the radiance of
complete faith and understanding.  I told her of
Aunt Letitia's money, of my desire to remain at
our cottage till the end of the year because&mdash;&mdash;  Should
I tell her why?  Should I tell her that which
I had even withheld from Dimbie?  Jane was so
sensible, so&mdash;&mdash;  And out of the gathering darkness
it came to me that she was crying silently, despairingly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jane," I whispered, "you are crying.
You must not do that, Dimbie might come, and it
would distress him.  Listen, I am not unhappy
now.  Do not think I am sorry for myself,
for&mdash;
perhaps I cannot make it clear to you, words are so
futile, but&mdash;one morning just lately, one
wonderful dawn when God Himself took out His pallet
and brush and touched the clouds with softest grey
and pearl, and pink and rose, when the first note of
a still sleepy bird broke the silence, when the flowers
shook the dew from their fresh morning faces,
something came to my room on footsteps light as
thistledown, something came to my bed on which I had
spent a long, weary, sleepless night, and laid a
gentle, healing hand on my aching brow, and sorrow
and pain and the fear of death fell from me, and I
was comforted.  You will say I was fanciful,
imaginative, that my mind was overwrought from fatigue;
but no, I was calm and clear-eyed, and I knew that
it was Peace that had come to me.  I opened my
arms wide and held it closely, never to let go.  'Dear
Comforter,' I whispered, 'you shall never leave me,
for now I know a happiness which is not of this
world, but is of a life which is eternal.'
</p>

<p>
"I lay very still thinking about it.  I must tell
you that during my weeks of suffering I had lost my
faith, I had lost God.  I felt that He had treated me
too cruelly.  'He is not a God of love,' I had cried.
'I cannot believe that.  I have done with Him.'
So as I lay watching the dawn, waiting for the sun,
I wondered and wondered again: 'Has God forgiven
me&mdash;forgiven my rebellion, taken pity on my
loneliness?' For when Dimbie has said his prayers
at night with his hand in mine, and entered into His
presence, I have felt so lonely and cried in my heart,
'Lord, let me find Thee again, for where Dimbie is
there I want to be.'
</p>

<p>
"'Perhaps He has forgiven me, and wants me&mdash;<i>even</i>
me,' I said to myself.  With my eyes on the
glowing east I waited and watched for the sun.  At
last he appeared, and, as though looking for me, sent
a warm shaft of light across my body.  And from
me came the words, 'God is good!  Allah is great!'  And
I laughed aloud, and Dimbie stirred and woke.
'What is it, girl?' he asked.  'Have you had a
good night?'
</p>

<p>
"'A bad, bad night, but such a dawn.  Look!
Here from my corner I can see all the beauty of the
world&mdash;shell-pink softness, the red glory of sunrise,
a distant cornfield touched with gold, dewdrops on
gossamer web.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'O world as God has made it, all is beauty;<br />
  And knowing this is love, and love is duty.<br />
  What further may be sought for&mdash;&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And Dimbie put a gentle arm around me and drew
my head on to his shoulder.  'And have you no
further need to ask for, sweetheart?' he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"'Not one,' I whispered.  'I am beginning to
understand things&mdash;just a little, and I am at peace.'"
</p>

<p>
I stopped.  Night had fallen, my story was finished.
Jane got up&mdash;I could not see her face&mdash;and she
walked across the lawn to the sweet-pea hedge.  No
sound broke the stillness of the garden.
</p>

<p>
Presently she returned and knelt in front of me.
</p>

<p>
"Little old pupil."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said.
</p>

<p>
"I want to say something to you.  Most people
say things when it is too late.  I don't want to be
too late.  I want to tell you, now, that you have
given me all the happiness I have had for the last
eight years.  An Indian station is a dreary place for
a plain, unattached, working woman.  I should
have become hard, dull, apathetic but for your love,
little Marguerite, but for your admiration of my
poor qualities.  Your bright, loving letters came
each month as a draught of fresh water to a tired,
thirsty traveller.  Your faithfulness cheered me on
my way.  Your symp&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to hear any more, Jane," I broke in.
</p>

<p>
"And but for you I should never have returned
to England."
</p>

<p>
"And you would have missed happiness, the
crown of your life."
</p>

<p>
She paused and looked up into my face.
</p>

<p>
"Happiness!" she said a little bitterly, "the
crown of my life!  I don't know what you mean.
I only know that you suffer; I have just heard your
story."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, don't speak of that!  There are other things.
There is love."
</p>

<p>
"Love and I passed each other long years ago,"
she said.  "Love mocked me, laughed at me, left
me alone."
</p>

<p>
"But he may return."
</p>

<p>
"It is unlikely.  I am not young.  But I don't
want to talk of myself.  I want only to speak of you.
A little while back you said&mdash;you said that the fear
of death fell from you.  What did you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Just what I said," and I bent my head and
kissed her.  "I think I hear Dimbie."
</p>

<p>
He came down the lane whistling, through the
white gate&mdash;a dark, mysterious figure.
</p>

<p>
"Three mushrooms!" he called gaily.  "One for
each of us.  Now I must light up.  You are all in
the dark."
</p>

<p>
"We are all in the dark," said Jane hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
"And the light is coming," said I.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
</h3>

<h4>
DIMBIE TAKES PETER AND AMELIA IN HAND
</h4>

<p>
Peter and mother are here again, and Jane
has been transferred to the bachelor's room.
</p>

<p>
Peter is gouty, irritable, chilly&mdash;for October is
with us and giving us sharp little frosts&mdash;and
sulphurous in his language.
</p>

<p>
Amelia wears a patient, stand-by-me-O-Lord air;
and Dimbie is crossly resigned to the inevitable.
</p>

<p>
He came to me this morning.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to kick Peter."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I agreed, drawing my blue nightingale,
which mother has made me, more closely round
my shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to pitch him out of the front door."
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You have no objection?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, choose a flower-bed for his descent."
</p>

<p>
"But I want to hurt him."
</p>

<p>
"I quite sympathise with you in your desire,
which is most reasonable.  But were he to alight
on the gravel path he might break his leg, and then
we should be obliged to have him here for weeks."
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall certainly not choose the path," said
Dimbie decisively.
</p>

<p>
"That is right.  What has he been doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Everything he shouldn't do.  Your mother is
reduced to tears, and Amelia is flinging the
saucepans and kettles at the kitchen-range."
</p>

<p>
"She is certainly making a noise."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie sat down on the bed and knit his brows.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, dear," I said sympathetically.  "I
couldn't help his coming; I didn't invite him."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  Naturally your mother wanted to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Poor mother!  To live for three months
without any respite upon the edge of a crater subject
at any moment to volcanic eruptions is naturally
wearing, and she must have an occasional change
in order to keep her reason."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie nursed his leg, and his mouth was a little
more crooked than usual.  I lay and watched him.
How unselfish and forbearing he was!  He put up
with Peter for mother's sake, he put up with mother
for my sake, he put up with Jane for her own and
the Doctor's sake.  Here he was yearning to be
alone, to be by ourselves; and the house was full
up with parents, friends, and doctors.  And I, to
add to his worries, have been obliged to keep my
room for the last week owing to a feverish cold and
general poorliness.
</p>

<p>
"But they will all go soon," I said, trying to
comfort him.  "Peter and mother are returning
home after the wedding, and Jane is to be married
next month."
</p>

<p>
"November is an idiotic month for a wedding,"
he said irritably.
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"She mightn't have been in such a deuce of a hurry."
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't she, it's the Doctor."
</p>

<p>
"Then he ought to have learnt patience at his age."
</p>

<p>
I smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You've grown fond of Jane?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I like her all right, but it's you I'm thinking
of.  She seems to know how to look after you and
make you comfortable.  I'm rough and Amelia's
stupid, and it's amazing how she knows exactly
what you want.  And Amelia has taken to her, she's
a perfect lamb in her presence."
</p>

<p>
"I wish Peter would be a lamb, too.  How are
they getting on at meals?"
</p>

<p>
And Dimbie gave me a most vivid description of
how they <i>were</i> getting on at meals, which left me
weak with laughter.
</p>

<p>
"And really, sweet," he concluded, "I am rather
glad you are fast here, though the drawing-room
without you seems like a barren wilderness.  Your
old corner looks lonely and empty."
</p>

<p>
"I'll soon be there to fill it," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you are better?"  He furrowed
his brow.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder how many times a day you ask me that,
dear one.  Don't I look better?"  He regarded me
anxiously.  "When we get to our new house&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes!" he said, brightening at once.  "It is
change you want.  As soon as ever we have cleared
out this rabbit warren we'll begin our plans.  We'll
be our own architects&mdash;master builders, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean by the rabbit warren mother and Peter?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he laughed.  "And when the endless
discussion of frocks and Jane's wedding is over we'll
set to work hard.  I want the house to be ready
by the summer."
</p>

<p>
A little pain settled at my heart.  He was so bent
upon building this new home for us&mdash;a home after
our own hearts, a house with south-west windows
to catch every bit of sunshine for me, with a verandah
in which I could lie, with an old-world garden&mdash;we
must find a plot of land with well-grown, stately
trees&mdash;with extensive views, with distant, pine-clad
hills, and smiling, fertile valleys.  Perhaps a river
might be included too, a babbling stream which
would cheer me with its happy laughter.  His eyes
glisten as he paints his picture, develops his
foreground, sketches in his distances.
</p>

<p>
"They must be blue distances," he said to-day.
</p>

<p>
"They might be grey, swept by clouds, wrapped
in mist."
</p>

<p>
"Even then they would be beautiful," he argued.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I agreed, "most distances are beautiful;
look at the frog-pond."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Still attached to our little home?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, so attached!  I love it more each day.  It
is so cosy, and we are so comfortable.  Now that
Amelia has permitted us to have daily help there is
nothing we want, is there?"
</p>

<p>
A cloud passed over his face.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry that you still do not wish to leave,
Marg.  I know it would be so much better for you,
and Renton insists upon it.  He says in bracing air
you will be so much stronger, and&mdash;I am
disappointed that you are not interested."
</p>

<p>
"He does not know&mdash;&mdash;" the words broke from
me.  And then, "I <i>am</i> interested.  I want to do
what you want.  Your picture is entrancing.  Let
us begin at once.  I will draw a plan of the garden,
and you shall draw a plan of the house, and then
we'll compare notes."
</p>

<p>
I spoke rapidly.  Why should we not begin, as
he was so eager?  It would give him occupation
during the long days.  It would make him happy,
feeling that it was being done for me and my
comfort.
</p>

<p>
He brightened at once.
</p>

<p>
"Where shall we have it?" I went on.  "Shall
it be on the top of Leith Hill, or at Hind Head,
Farndon, Frensham, or Dorking?"
</p>

<p>
"It must be where there are pine trees and heather
for you, and in the neighbourhood of shooting for
me.  It must be high up, and yet not too cold, and
we must pitch the house southwest for the sun."
</p>

<p>
"And there must be a river," I continued gravely,
"and blue distances, a wide, extensive view, grand
forest trees in our own garden, and lawns that have
been rolled and 'mowd' for a thousand years.  And
God will specially create it all for us."
</p>

<p>
"Now you are being impertinent."  He smiled
happily.  "I will fetch paper and pencils."  But
he didn't, for Peter arrived at the moment and
forced an entrance.  His nose was a trifle blue, and
his eyes glistened as a warrior's who has recently
tasted blood.  He pecked me on the forehead and
asked me how I was.  I informed him that I was
only very middling, and Dimbie added that rest and
quiet were most essential for my well-being.
</p>

<p>
Peter ignored Dimbie and seated himself in front
of the fire, to which he held out a gouty leg, and
remarked that Amelia was a brazen minx.  Dimbie
and I not replying, he repeated it again.  Dimbie
and I admired the view from the window, and Peter
for the third time repeated the same uninteresting
remark, but this time with a yell.  Dimbie said
politely and firmly that if the yell was repeated Peter
must leave the room, as my nerves were not in a
state to stand cat-calls.  Peter glared but didn't
repeat the yell, at which I marvelled.
</p>

<p>
Mother popped her head in at the door, and
seeing Peter, popped it out with extreme activity.
</p>

<p>
Jane did the same.
</p>

<p>
Amelia popped hers in, but kept it there, and then
advanced.  She sort of arched her back as she looked
at Peter, and bristled and figuratively spat.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Amelia?" I asked, before they got
at each other.
</p>

<p>
"The butcher, mum."
</p>

<p>
"How often the butcher seems to call," I said
wearily.  "Does he live very near to us?"
</p>

<p>
"He lives in the village, mum, and he's killed a
home-fed pig."
</p>

<p>
"Poor thing!  Just when there's an abundance
of acorns."
</p>

<p>
Amelia ignored my sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"A nice loin of pork with sage and onion stuffing
would be a change, mum."
</p>

<p>
"I don't eat sage and onion," growled Peter.
</p>

<p>
"A nice loin of pork with sage and onion stuffing
would be a change," repeated Amelia steadily.
"And I've got oysters and a partridge for you, mum."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want both.  General Macintosh could
have the partridge," I said pacifically.
</p>

<p>
"There'll be soup, pork, Charlotte <i>Ruce</i>, and
savoury eggs for the dining-room."  When Amelia
adopted that tone it was unwise to argue.
</p>

<p>
"Do <i>you</i> know how to make Charlotte Russe?"
</p>

<p>
Amelia creaked, and a bone snapped, the result
of an extraordinary veracity.
</p>

<p>
"I have an idea how it's made, but Miss
Fairbrother does the sweets now.  She's gettin' her
hand in before she's married.  She's goin' to spoil
the Doctor.  Most ladies spoils their husbands."  She
fixed a baleful eye upon Dimbie and Peter.
</p>

<p>
Peter seized the poker and thumped the fire into
a blaze.  I was glad, for the room was chilly.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all, Amelia?"
</p>

<p>
"No, mum.  I wants to speak about the bathroom.
It's fair swimmin' with water.  You could
float the canoe in it."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, has the cistern overflowed?" asked Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, it's General Macintosh.  When he
takes his bath in the mornin' he thinks he's suddenly
turned into an alligator.  The splashin's dreadful,
and when he's tired of that he just bales the water
on to the floor.  It's like the Bay of Biscay when I
go in, and I shall be glad if you'll kindly speak to
him about it, sir."
</p>

<p>
Peter put his gouty leg carefully and firmly on to
the floor, and, as golfers say, got a good stance.
Then he opened his mouth, but before he could
utter a word Dimbie had gently but forcibly taken
him by the shoulders and put him out of the room.
Amelia was triumph personified, but her victory
was short lived, for when Dimbie returned he was
very angry with her.
</p>

<p>
"Understand now, Amelia, that no such tales are
brought to the mistress.  I will <i>not</i> have her worried
with trivial household matters.  I thought you were
capable and clever enough to manage for yourself;
you keep telling us that you are, and the first thing
that goes wrong you fly to her.  Understand too
that your manner of speaking to General Macintosh
is little short of downright impertinence, and if it
should occur again, if there are any more scenes,
not only he goes out of the house, but you also.
Yes, <i>you</i> go, understand that.  You are a good girl,
but there are plenty of other good girls in the world.
Your mistress is poorly, weak and nervous, and she
is <i>not</i> to be worried.  Now go!  Not a word.  <i>Go!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Dimbie stopped for breath, and weeping,
humiliated, and very unhappy, Amelia went.  Whether
she straightway fisted Peter, whether she peppered
him from every point of vantage, we have not
inquired; but during the last six hours there has been
a marked improvement in the behaviour of both.
Peter is not bearing Dimbie any grudge for his
ejectment, which seems to me remarkable, but
which Dimbie says isn't.  "Bully a bully and he
becomes an angel."
</p>

<p>
"He is hardly that yet," I objected.
</p>

<p>
"He passed the hot buttered toast to us at tea
and didn't have any himself."
</p>

<p>
"Hot buttered toast doesn't agree with him," I
said.  "It has always lain heavily upon his stomach."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie laughed, and Peter entered in the middle of it.
</p>

<p>
"Your mother and I are going for a stroll.  Do
you want anything from the village?"
</p>

<p>
My stare was rude, I fear.  It was certainly the
first time I had ever heard Peter ask if anybody
wanted anything.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," I began, "it is very good of you."  I
cast round in my mind for some requirement&mdash;soap,
candles, Shinio, oatmeal, pearl barley, gelatine,
potatoes, all the various things Amelia spent
her life in requiring&mdash;but we were not "out" of
any of them.  Peter was waiting; his kindly
intention must not be nipped in the bud at any cost.
"Chips!" I cried with illumination.
</p>

<p>
"Chips?"
</p>

<p>
"Firewood.  Hudson's Dry Soap boxes."
</p>

<p>
Peter clutched at his understanding.
</p>

<p>
"Amelia chops them up," I explained.
</p>

<p>
"He can't carry soap boxes home," whispered
Dimbie.  "Couldn't you want darning wool?"
</p>

<p>
Of course, darning wool was one of the most
useful things in the world.
</p>

<p>
"Please bring me two cards of darning wool," I
said aloud.  "You will get them at the candle shop."
</p>

<p>
Peter rubbed his head.
</p>

<p>
"Wool at a candle shop?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it keeps everything&mdash;sweets, oil, candles
and haberdashery."
</p>

<p>
He went out of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm blessed!" ejaculated Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"So am I.  He looked quite docile, and he's
really wonderfully handsome for a man of his age."
</p>

<p>
Peter was back.
</p>

<p>
"What colour your mother wishes to know?"
</p>

<p>
"Colour?  Oh, anything!"
</p>

<p>
"Brown," said Dimbie hastily, turning a
reproachful eye upon me.
</p>

<p>
"You really are stupid, Marg," he said when
Peter had gone.
</p>

<p>
"I admit it," I said ruefully, "and we haven't
a brown thing in the house.  Why couldn't you
have said black while you were about it?"
</p>

<p>
And Dimbie didn't know why he hadn't said black.
But it is sufficient for me to know that Peter is trying
to be good, and that Amelia has ceased to throw
saucepans about the house, as the noise was a little
trying.  Peter may yet go to heaven.

CHAPTER XXVII
</h3>

<h4>
A DISCUSSION ABOUT A WEDDING-GOWN
</h4>

<p>
The discussion about Jane's wedding-gown
began in that pleasant hour between tea
and dinner on the soft edge of the dusk, when the
refreshing influence of tea still pervades one, when
the fire seems to burn its brightest, when the clock
ticks its softest, when the little shadows begin to
creep into the corners of the room, and the familiar
furniture and ornaments become a soft, rounded blur.
</p>

<p>
Nanty had been persuaded into staying for a
real long evening; and John had been persuaded,
against his better judgment, into putting up his
horses at the "Ring o' Bells," and was in the kitchen
saying pleasant and pacifying things to Amelia, no
doubt.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be held up by highwaymen.  John will
be gagged and thrown into a ditch, and my pockets
will be rifled and my jewellery stolen."
</p>

<p>
Nanty said this resignedly, nay almost cheerfully,
as though a change from the ordinary routine of life
would not be unacceptable to her.  And mother
gazed at her in fearful admiration.  Heroism in any
form appeals strongly to mother, though she herself
is the bravest of the brave.  To have lived with
Peter for twenty-five years denotes some courage.
</p>

<p>
Nanty's pleasure on hearing of Jane's engagement
was cloaked by a pretence at surprise and pity; but
of course we all know Nanty.  She had been very
kind to Jane when she lived with us.  "Above the
ruck of ordinary governesses," she had pronounced.
"Not always on the look-out for slights and snubs;
a most sensible young person!"  Now the sensible
young person was anxious to tell her herself of the
happiness which had come into her life, and had
requested mother and me to keep silent on the
subject "if we <i>could</i>."  She had, however, conceded
to our earnest request that the announcement should
be made in our presence after the men had gone
out.  We knew that Nanty's observations would be
amusing, and we looked forward to a pleasant
half-hour.  When tea had been removed Peter seemed
inclined to linger, notwithstanding the unnecessary
number of women around him.  The arm-chair
which he had annexed&mdash;(Dimbie's)&mdash;was
luxurious, the fire was warm, his temper was mild.
Dimbie seemed still more inclined to linger.  The
rug on which he was stretched was curly and soft,
his hand sought mine, he liked and was always
entertained by Nanty.  Mother and I looked at one
another and looked at Jane, and curbed our
impatience.  Mother glanced at Peter and opened her
mouth and shut it again.  The courage of Horatius
was not within her this day.  I did the same at
Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, dear?" he asked.  "Aren't you
comfy?  Shall I alter your pillow?"
</p>

<p>
I assured him that I was perfectly comfortable,
and at the same time ventured to suggest that it was
a lovely evening on which to take a walk.  Jane's
approaching marriage could not be discussed before
two men when one of them was Peter; for Nanty
was never talkative before Peter, she said he always
roused her temper to such a pitch that she could
scarcely get her breath.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie agreed with my view of the evening's
attractiveness, and stretched his legs luxuriously
towards the fire.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned that the birch trees in the spinny
would be at their best, dressed out in all their
autumn glory.
</p>

<p>
He again agreed with me, and remarked that
their grey boles was what peculiarly appealed to
him&mdash;grey with the vivid splashes of orange and
red leaves above.
</p>

<p>
The others began to look bored.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned that the squirrels would be busy
gathering and storing acorns for the winter.
</p>

<p>
He said he thought it was within the range of
possibility, and he put more coal on the fire.
</p>

<p>
Mother folded her hands and looked resigned,
and Jane took some needlework from her basket.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you say what you want?" said Nanty
suddenly.  "Men don't understand hints and beating
about the bush.  They are simple-minded creatures&mdash;some
of them.  Do you want your husband to
fetch you some chocolate from the village?"
</p>

<p>
Dimbie looked at me inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to go for a walk for an hour, and
take father with you and show him the beauties of
the spinny.  And you might take a basket and get
some blackberries."
</p>

<p>
Mother's startled and amazed countenance at the
idea of Peter's going blackberrying made me laugh,
and Dimbie's reproachful face moved me to pity.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Peter might go blackberrying alone and
you to see the squirrels," I said confusedly.
</p>

<p>
And now Nanty laughed outright, and mother
sat horror-stricken, gazing at Peter.  But he by
a merciful dispensation of Providence, was dozing
which was a lucky thing for me.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie got up slowly and stretched himself.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, General Macintosh," he said resignedly,
but Peter dozed on.  Dimbie patted his leg,
unfortunately the gouty one, and Peter started up
swearing loudly.
</p>

<p>
"We've got to go for a walk," said Dimbie
apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"Who's got to go for a walk?" demanded Peter
fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"You and I.  We have to go blackberrying and
see the squirrels."
</p>

<p>
The look which Peter gave to Dimbie obliged
me to press my mouth against the tortoise's back
to keep from screaming.
</p>

<p>
Peter sat down heavily.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know whether you think you are being
funny, sir, but I don't.  To wake a man up from
a much-needed sleep to talk about da&mdash;ahem,
squirrels and blackberries seems to me to be about
the most deucedly idiotic thing&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hsh, father!" I said.  "Dimbie wants you to go
for a walk with him to the spinny.  It's a lovely
evening, and you might just happen to come across
some squirrels and blackberries."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't <i>want</i> to see any squirrels or
bl&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dimbie took him by the arm and began gently to
drag him towards the door.  "Come on," he said
coaxingly, "we've got to go somewhere, General.
They want to get rid of us.  Women are&mdash;&mdash;" and
Peter was so interested in hearing what Dimbie
thought of the senseless creatures, that he actually
followed him into the hall, allowed himself to be put
into his top coat, and led through the door, down
the path and out of the gate.
</p>

<p>
"You can take a breath, mother, dear," I said,
"or you will suffocate.  And now, Jane, tell your
news, they won't be back under an hour."
</p>

<p>
She drew a thread from the linen tea-cloth she
was making with unswerving fingers, but the colour
crept into her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"She looks as though she were making bottom
drawer things," remarked Nanty dryly.
</p>

<p>
"And that's exactly what she is doing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  For herself?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she'd hardly bother to make them for
other people."
</p>

<p>
"I disagree with you.  Miss Fairbrother is exactly
the sort of kind person who would like to see a
friend's drawer filled with a lot of feminine
frippery."
</p>

<p>
"This is for her own," I returned.  "Go on, Jane."
</p>

<p>
She put down her work.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to be telling, so you had better finish,
Marguerite."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you are too shy.  Well, Nanty, Jane
is to be married next month.  Guess to whom.
You shall have three tries."
</p>

<p>
Nanty sniffed superciliously.
</p>

<p>
"I should have thought she would have had
more sense.  To an Indian rajah who lives in a
gilded palace?"
</p>

<p>
"Wrong."
</p>

<p>
"To a man in the Service with a small pension,
an enlarged liver, residing at Brighton and requiring
a kind nurse?"
</p>

<p>
"Wrong again."
</p>

<p>
"To a widower&mdash;perhaps the father of the two
sticky children you mentioned to me?"
</p>

<p>
"The mother is alive and extremely healthy,"
said Jane.
</p>

<p>
Nanty leaned back in her chair.
</p>

<p>
"I only hope the man is as nice as can be expected
or hoped for.  Miss Fairbrother has the appearance
of a woman who would throw herself away upon a
rake, hoping to reform his morals and save his soul."
</p>

<p>
Jane smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think that Dr. Renton's soul is in danger?"
</p>

<p>
Nanty checked a gasp of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I have always felt that he was a man with a
hidden&mdash;something.  I have wondered about it,"
she said, recovering herself.
</p>

<p>
"Most women wonder at single men, and they
wonder still more when they are married," said
mother.
</p>

<p>
"Who," I asked, laughing, "the women or the men?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the women!"
</p>

<p>
She spoke with an earnestness that recalled Peter
and his blackberrying to my mind, and I laughed
again.
</p>

<p>
"Men," said Nanty, "are necessary for the
continuation of the race.  I cannot see that they are
of any other use in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Now I am waiting for your opinion, Marguerite,"
said Jane with a twinkle.  "I should like to have
no illusions about man before I marry him."
</p>

<p>
"I am not to be drawn," I returned.  "There
are men and men.  The two looking for squirrels
at the moment are extreme types.  Perhaps there
is something half-way between, and you may be
fairly fortunate."
</p>

<p>
Jane smiled with a satisfied air.
</p>

<p>
"You have not congratulated me," she said to
Nanty.  "It is usual, I think."
</p>

<p>
"I don't congratulate people on marriage."
</p>

<p>
"You are a cynic."
</p>

<p>
"No, but my eyes are open; there was a time
when they were closed like yours."
</p>

<p>
"It is a pity," said Jane softly.  "I hope mine
will always remain shut."
</p>

<p>
"Let us hope so," returned Nanty a little bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"I thought we were to discuss Jane's wedding
gown," said mother plaintively, bringing us back
to actualities.
</p>

<p>
She fetched two big bundles of patterns from a
side-table and handed them to Jane.
</p>

<p>
"Before we begin," said the latter, turning again
to Nanty, "won't you change your mind and
congratulate me?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll congratulate Dr. Renton, if that will satisfy you."
</p>

<p>
"But it won't.  I think I am quite as much, if
not more, to be congratulated than he."
</p>

<p>
"Now you are being humble," said Nanty whimsically,
"and I don't like humility in a woman.  A
woman should always remember that she is quite
good enough for any man living."  And with that
Jane had to be satisfied.
</p>

<p>
And what a discussion followed as to the gown
Jane should wear on the great day.  We might
have been schoolgirls.  And the trouble was that
no two of us agreed on any single point&mdash;colour,
material, or fashion of making.  When mother
had soared away to silver gauze posed on chiffon,
Jane said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Kindly remember my age, and that I am going
to a wedding and not to a ball."
</p>

<p>
When Nanty even, roused to enthusiasm, had
completed a dream of a princess gown of softest
pastel-blue, chiffon velvet, Jane said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Kindly remember that I am small and dumpy."
</p>

<p>
And when I extolled the virtue of palest mauve
taffeta, Jane simply laughed outright and asked me
to look at her colouring.
</p>

<p>
"I'm looking," I said.  "You've brown hair and
bright red cheeks."
</p>

<p>
But she ignored all our suggestions.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be married in silver-grey poplin," she
pronounced.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly like a servant."  Nanty closed her
eyes.  "They always wear silver-grey.  I had three
parlour-maids in succession who had selected it
for their wedding-gowns."
</p>

<p>
"But alpaca, surely!  Mine will be silk poplin of
a good quality."
</p>

<p>
But Nanty and mother refused to take any
further interest in the subject, and Nanty picked
up a paper.
</p>

<p>
"What about grey cloth, then&mdash;pale dove-grey?"  Jane
waived the silver poplin with an apparent
effort.
</p>

<p>
Nanty put down the paper.
</p>

<p>
"Grey cloth with chinchilla is rather nice," she
admitted grudgingly.
</p>

<p>
"I did not mention chinchilla," said Jane meekly.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> will give the chinchilla as a wedding present
if you don't mind.  Grey cloth alone would be
most uninteresting."
</p>

<p>
"The coat must be a bolero," said mother firmly,
"lined with white satin."
</p>

<p>
"You are all evidently going to run me into a lot
of money.  I am not accustomed to satin linings.
I thought of having Italian cloth."
</p>

<p>
"What?" shouted mother and Nanty.
</p>

<p>
"Italian cloth," repeated Jane firmly.  "I hope
to do the whole thing for about five pounds."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Impossible!</i>" said Nanty.  "Fifteen would be
mean and skimpy."
</p>

<p>
Jane set her mouth good-humouredly.
</p>

<p>
"Then I can't get married."
</p>

<p>
"No, you evidently can't," agreed Nanty.  "It
would be unfair to the man."
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity," observed Jane, "because I rather
wanted to."
</p>

<p>
"A foolish desire on your part which should be
checked at once."
</p>

<p>
Mother began to look worried.  With a desire to
cheer her up I casually inquired of Nanty if she
had seen anything more of Professor Leighrail.  I
was unprepared for her dropping the patterns about
like chaff in a wind.
</p>

<p>
"Professor Leighrail!" said mother, with widely-open
eyes.  "Anastasia's old lover?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," I replied.  "He's a friend of ours,
and Nanty met him here the other day.  Have
you seen him again?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
She did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"It is a pity when deafness overtakes people&mdash;the
first sign of old age."
</p>

<p>
"She is not deaf," said mother, "and is only
fifty-one."
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Kiss me, mother, dear," I said, "you are so
practical at times.  And yet some people of your
age are quite romantic and sentimental."
</p>

<p>
"La, la, la, la!" sang Nanty.  She leaned over
my couch.  "Marguerite," she said, "I should slap
you if you were strong and well."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not," I said, "so kiss me."  And she
did so, while whispering that the Professor <i>had</i>
been to tea with her.  "It's not proper," I said, and
Nanty laughed.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
</h3>

<h4>
PREPARATIONS FOR A WEDDING
</h4>

<p>
The house is very quiet.  Jane and Dimbie
are out in the woods gathering sprays of
red-tinted brambles, briony, traveller's joy, bracken,
which though fading is of that golden tinge which
is almost more beautiful than the green, hips and
haws shining and scarlet, and clusters of berries
of the mountain-ash.  This collection of autumnal
loveliness is for the decoration of the cottage, for
is not Jane to be married to-morrow?  Mother and
Peter have gone for a stroll as Peter calls it, or for a
gallop as mother terms it, for Peter can get up as
much speed, in spite of his gouty leg, as Amelia can
with my Ilkley couch.
</p>

<p>
Amelia has "run" to the village for innumerable
things forgotten this morning when the grocer's
boy clamoured for orders.  And the Help I should
imagine, from the quiet of the house, has fallen
asleep over the kitchen fire.  The Help, from what
Amelia tells me, is very stupid and is no help at all.
She puts the blacking on the scullery floor instead
of on the boots.  She never screws the stopper on
to the Shinio bottle after use, and the contents are
therefore spilled all over the place.  She allows the
handles of the knives to lie in water.  "Does she
take them off the blades?" I asked, and I received
one of Amelia's halibut looks.  She forgets to
sprinkle tea-leaves on the carpets before brushing
them, though the tea-leaves are put all ready for
her in a nice clean saucer.  And yet, in spite of all
these enormities, Amelia permits her to remain and
not help.
</p>

<p>
Before "running" to the village just now she
wondered whether anything would go wrong during
her temporary absence and what the Help would
be up to.
</p>

<p>
"She's worse than her at Tompkinses'."
</p>

<p>
"The one who wore half a pound of tea as a
bustle when she left at night?"
</p>

<p>
Amelia seemed pleased at my memory, and she
then went on to explain why this Help was worse
than the other.  It appeared that deceit was her
besetting sin.  The other one openly, so to speak,
wore tea as a bustle; this one you could never catch.
She would leave of an evening with a face like the
Song of Solomon&mdash;I did not see the connection, but
did not like to interrupt&mdash;and yet butter, bacon,
and tea disappeared miraculously.  Amelia would
search her hand-bag when the Help was washing
up; she would look under the lining of her crêpe
bonnet.  "Crêpe!" I said.  "Is she a widow?"
</p>

<p>
But Amelia said she wasn't, that the bonnet had
been given to her by a late employer, and the crêpe
was of the best quality.  I felt remiss in not having
a crêpe bonnet too to present to the Help, and
asked Amelia if she thought my old yellow satin
dancing frock would be of any use to her, and
Amelia has gone off without replying.  Perhaps she
would like the frock for herself.  I know she can
dance, for have I not seen her executing the
cakewalk in Dimbie's tea-rose slippers?
</p>

<p>
The Help is to wear a cap and collar and cuffs
for to-morrow's festivities.  Amelia is making her
do this; and I am a little sorry for the poor Help,
for she may dislike a cap very much, having a
husband and four nearly grown-up children.
</p>

<p>
Amelia says that she and the Help will be able
to manage the guests quite easily, and I believe
her.  I know that she alone would be quite equal
to forty, and we are only expecting ten besides the
house-party.  A younger brother of Dr. Renton is
to be best man; and then there will be Nanty; a
Miss Rebecca Sharp, a Suffragist, and cousin to
Jane; Dr. Renton's married sister and her husband;
his housekeeper, who has served him faithfully like
a housekeeper in a book for nearly twenty years;
a Mrs. Wilbraham, an old patient, who has invited
herself; and Professor Leighrail.  Dimbie suggested
inviting the last, and I jumped at him.
</p>

<p>
"He will entertain Nanty," I said.
</p>

<p>
"You don't want to marry them?" said Dimbie
in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Dimbie, dear," I returned, "you must try to
break yourself of the habit of assuming that I am
perpetually trying to marry people."
</p>

<p>
"What about Jane and the Doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"I was a girl in the schoolroom when they fell in
love with one another."
</p>

<p>
"You brought them together."
</p>

<p>
"I did nothing of the kind.  Jane's visit was
arranged long before I knew."
</p>

<p>
He was only half convinced.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want another wedding from here," he
said a little gloomily.  "One is all right.  I like
Jane, and it has been fun and amusement for you.
But if Nanty and more pattern-books arrive I shall
clear off."
</p>

<p>
"Were I stronger," I said, "I should shake you."
</p>

<p>
"Would you?"  He laughed, holding his face to mine.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you are going to be very good to-morrow,
and give Jane away nicely.  You mustn't give her
a push, you must hand her over gracefully to the
Doctor."
</p>

<p>
Dimbie screwed up his face.
</p>

<p>
"I don't fancy the job.  I wish you could be
there, Marg, to give me a wink at the right moment."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't!" I whispered, in a momentary fit
of passionate longing.  "Don't remind me that I
can't be there.  Dimbie, I am <i>so</i> disappointed that
I shall not see Jane married!  I do so love Jane.
It is&mdash;hard to bear."
</p>

<p>
As the words were uttered I would have given
a kingdom to recall them.  When should I learn
control?  Pain flitted across my dear one's face,
pity and sorrow.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind!" I cried, striving to heal the
wound.  "I shall see her dressed.  She is going to
don her wedding-gown in my room, and I am to put
all the finishing touches.  She will kneel in front
of me, and I am to pull a lock of hair out here, pat
one in there, persuade a curl to wander across her
forehead, tilt her hat to a more fashionable angle,
and altogether make her the most beautiful Jane
in the world."
</p>

<p>
But Dimbie was not to be comforted.  He has
gone to the woods with black care hovering very
close at hand, and every effort must I strain this
evening to bring back the smile to his lips.  There
must be no sad faces to-morrow.  Jane has had
a somewhat hard and lonely life, and she must
embark upon her new voyage without a shadow of
unhappiness.  The Doctor will be good to her, I
know&mdash;gentle and chivalrous.  One knows
instinctively when a man will be good to the woman
he has married; it is in his voice, his manner, in
the very way he looks at her.  What Dimbie is to
me he will be to her.  Why should Jane and I be
of the elect among women?  We deserve it no
more than mother and Nanty.  But they will have
their compensation, I verily believe.  God in His
goodness will reserve for all the tired, disillusioned
wives of the world a little peaceful niche where they
may rest from their husbands, which is another
word for labours.  And the husbands!  I do not
think that theirs is always the blame, the fault.
There must be many too who would like to find a
peaceful haven where they may smoke and read,
and put their feet upon the chairs, and rest from
the perpetual nagging and fault-finding of their wives.

<p>
Amelia is back and has roused the Help, for her
voice was borne to me loudly indignant.  "And
there is no kettle boiling for tea!"  Poor Help, or
sensible Help?  Did she realise that if she waited
long enough Amelia would put on the kettle?
There are usually plenty of Amelias to put on
kettles and scold Helps and tidy up the universe.
And so also are there many Helps who realise this,
and therefore sit with folded hands doing nothing
so long as the Amelias will permit them.  I don't
know to whom my sympathy goes the most, the
Amelias or Helps.
</p>

<p>
Peter and mother are back too, and are removing
their outdoor wraps.  Peter, blowing and snorting
like the alligator to which Amelia likened him, has
informed me that it is a beastly cold day with an
east wind, that the roads in Surrey are the worst
in Europe, and that mother is the slowest woman in
God's universe.  Mother has tip-toed back to tell me
what she thinks of Peter.  That his limp was so
fast and furious that you might just as well try to
keep up with a fire-engine, that she has made up
her mind that this will be her last walk with him
(mother has been saying this for many years), and
that he has <i>forbidden</i> her to wear her new bonnet
on the morrow, as&mdash;she looks a fright in it.
</p>

<p>
I have soothed her as best I can.  I have told
her that Dimbie shall stand by and see that she
does wear the new bonnet, and that if Peter is in
any way untractable he shall be locked up for the
day in the shed with his own canoe, which has
caused her to steal away in a state of fearful joy.
</p>

<p>
I see Jane and Dimbie coming through the gate.
Jane is wellnigh lost in a tangled wealth of glorious
autumn treasures, and Dimbie trails behind him
an immense bough of pine.  It is for me to smell,
I know&mdash;to inhale the delicious, resinous scent
fresh from the woods.  A bit broken off is less than
nothing, you must have a branch straight from the
heart of the trunk.  When I have felt it and held
it, and smelled it and loved it, it shall stand
by the grandfather clock in the hall, and it will
make a beautiful decoration for to-morrow's festivities.
</p>

<p>
I must cease scribbling.  They are all assembling
for the last family tea.  The Doctor has just arrived.
Jane has a bunch of mountain-ash berries tucked
into her belt.  Here comes Amelia with the tea and
toast, and resignation under suffering written on
her brow!  What has the Help been doing now?

CHAPTER XXIX
</h3>

<h4>
JANE'S WEDDING
</h4>

<p>
Nanty described it as a calm, gracious sort of
wedding.  There was no blare of trumpets
when Jane and the Doctor plighted their troth.
</p>

<p>
"Just as it should be," said Nanty.  "A wedding
at all times is to me a depressing spectacle; and
when accompanied by a sound of brass and tinkling
of cymbals, and shawms, and ringing of bells, and
thumping of wedding marches, it simply becomes
ridiculous, not to mention that the making of such
noises is a relic of barbarism."
</p>

<p>
Mother said a bright ray of sunshine found Jane
out, and lit up and illumined her face just as she
was repeating the beautiful and solemn words, "Till
death us do part."
</p>

<p>
"She looked&mdash;she looked&mdash;&mdash;"  Mother paused
for suitable words.
</p>

<p>
"As though she had been sunstruck," interposed Nanty.
</p>

<p>
Mother was mildly indignant.
</p>

<p>
"She looked like an angel, Anastasia."
</p>

<p>
Nanty gave a little grunt.
</p>

<p>
"An angel in a Paris hat, eh?  But I must admit
she looked rather nice.  She's certainly far too good
for the Doctor."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, Jane is getting on," said mother
doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"If she were sixty she would be too good for any
man," pronounced Nanty decisively, and when she
adopted that tone mother ceased to argue.
</p>

<p>
I was glad that the wedding morning dawned
serenely beautiful.  I had feared lowering skies,
heavy, white mists, a dripping, gloomy, sad-faced
world, but November was on her best behaviour.
The sun sent mild, warm rays across the garden,
and the few leaves which still clung to the trees
across the fence were as splashes of gold against
the brown branches and quiet, blue sky.
</p>

<p>
They bade me remain in bed till late on in the
morning, so that I might be well and strong for
the reception, which was a grand name to give to
a gathering of a dozen or more people.
</p>

<p>
I lay and laughed at the various sounds of the
household, which were carried to me through my
open door&mdash;at Amelia's shrill expostulations with
the Help, who seemed to be bent upon doing the
wrong thing at the wrong time; at Peter's
explosions as he was chivied about from pillar to post
by "tiresome women who would go putting silly
decorations all over the confounded place"; and at
Dimbie's perpetual wailing at the disappearance of
the corkscrew.  "Tie it round your neck on a
ribbon, Dumbarton," I could hear Peter growl; and
Dimbie said it was a most excellent suggestion on
the part of his father-in-law, and he would carry it
out at once.
</p>

<p>
"Would you mind moving once again, General
Macintosh, we must arrange the refreshments now,"
came Jane's voice pleading and ingratiating.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not preventing you."
</p>

<p>
"But we want the table, please."  And he
straightway burst into my room to tell me what he
thought of the institution of marriage.
</p>

<p>
"Not so much as a hole left for a cat to creep
into," he said angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Jumbles is here; <i>you</i> can stay if you like.  The
easy chair by the fire is very comfortable."
</p>

<p>
He dropped into it a little ungraciously.
</p>

<p>
"So you don't like weddings?" I said with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Like weddings!"
</p>

<p>
"Why did you come?"
</p>

<p>
"Your mother insisted.  When your mother gets
an idea into her head you might as well talk to a
mule."
</p>

<p>
"But <i>you</i> needn't have come," I said gently.
</p>

<p>
He put some coal on the fire with unnecessary energy.
</p>

<p>
"What is mother doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Getting in everybody's way."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was you who were doing that."
</p>

<p>
He vouchsafed no reply, and buried himself
behind <i>The Times</i>, thinking, I suppose, like the
ostrich, that if he covered up his head his body
would not be detected.
</p>

<p>
But Jane soon routed him out.
</p>

<p>
"I have come to dress Marguerite," she
announced.  "Amelia is permitting it."
</p>

<p>
There was no movement from behind the paper.
</p>

<p>
"General Macintosh, I am sorry to disturb you,
but the time is getting on."
</p>

<p>
"I thought Marguerite was dressed, she looks
very grand."
</p>

<p>
"It is the ribbons of my nightingale which have
deceived you, I have only that and my nightdress
on.  I can hardly appear in so scanty an attire."
</p>

<p>
"Give 'em something to talk about."
</p>

<p>
"Father," I said, "<i>will</i> you go."  And growling
and grumbling he went in search of mother,
presumably to have a row.
</p>

<p>
The sunshine streamed into the room, the tits
chattered, and a robin blithely showed what could
be done with a range of eight notes: tweet, tweet, ta
ra ra tweet, tre la, tre la, ta ra ra tweet.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Jane," I said, "it is singing to you.
Isn't it a lovely day!  I'm so glad the sun is shining.
Are you happy, Jane?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said simply, dropping a kiss on to my
hair, which she was gently brushing.  "I'm too
happy to talk about it; and I must hurry, Dimbie
will be here in a minute, he has got something for you."
</p>

<p>
And there he was, peeping through the door with
Amelia close behind him.  In his arms was a large
cardboard box.
</p>

<p>
"It's a new tea-gown straight from Paris, mum,"
said Amelia, excitedly, as Dimbie removed the lid.
"There were twenty to choose from," added Jane,
"and <i>we</i> were over an hour in settlin' on it,"
completed Amelia.
</p>

<p>
Very carefully Dimbie removed all the folds of
soft, white paper, and shook out the gown&mdash;a
lovely mass of pearly satin, soft as the petals of a
rose, and marvellous old lace of cobweb
transparency and texture.
</p>

<p>
"It is too beautiful!" I whispered to him,
folding my arms around his neck.
</p>

<p>
"And there is a rose for your neck, sweetheart,
just the colour of your hair.  Isn't he a beauty?"
</p>

<p>
I held the fragrant, yellow softness to my face, for
the tears were coming, and Jane and Amelia stole
softly away and left us by ourselves for ten
minutes&mdash;ten minutes which would alone make the saddest
life worth living, and mine was not sad because I
had Dimbie.
</p>

<p>
Presently Jane came back.
</p>

<p>
"You must go, sir," she commanded, "or your
wife will not be ready."  And Dimbie went.
</p>

<p>
Deftly and quickly she arranged my hair, got
me into the lovely gown, and fastened the rose at
my breast.  And while she worked she talked.
She made me laugh at her description of the Help,
who was sitting dazed and "amoithered" in the
middle of the kitchen, drinking the strongest black
tea, and regarding every onslaught of Amelia with
the utmost indifference and apathy.  And Amelia!
She, of course, was working like a traction engine
in the refreshment-room, shaking her fist at the
creams and jellies, some of which refused to stand
up, and persuading trails of briony to stick to their
proper position on the cake and not wander away
to the dishes of oyster pâtés.
</p>

<p>
"And now you are ready, and you look&mdash;well,
Dimbie will tell you how you look.  I will call him."
</p>

<p>
"Don't," I said, "he will stay so long, and then
you will go to another room to dress, and I do so
want to watch you.  I shall be awfully particular
about your hair."
</p>

<p>
"You won't suggest a hair-frame?"
</p>

<p>
"God forbid!  You are not the type of woman
for a frame.  But you drag your hair too much off
your temples at times, and although your forehead
is low and broad and all that a forehead ought to
be, I fancy a few tendrils straying across it would
look sweet under your chinchilla toque, and you
must humour my fancy, Jane."
</p>

<p>
Obediently she knelt down and let me do what
I would with her.
</p>

<p>
"Be very careful getting into your skirt," I
commanded.  "Don't ruffle your hair whatever you do."
</p>

<p>
She made a comical face.
</p>

<p>
"What a fuss!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't fuss on your wedding-day you
never will.  And men don't like dowdy women.
Come here and I will fasten your bodice.  I can
if you will kneel very close to me."
</p>

<p>
For a moment I rested my cheek against the soft,
beautiful fur which trimmed the bolero-bodice&mdash;Nanty
had indeed been generous.
</p>

<p>
"Jane, dear," I said, "I <i>am</i> glad you are going
to be married, and that you will have no more
sticky children to teach.  I should like to have
seen the Doctor as a bridegroom.  I feel sure that
he will use profane language in the stress of his
emotions.  Now put on your hat and walk across
the room with stately mien so that I may have a
good look at you."  I nodded approval.  "You'll
do.  You look sweet&mdash;a study in grey.  And you
are quite tall and slight in that elegant frock.  I
believe even Nanty will be satisfied."
</p>

<p>
She came and knelt again by my couch.  How
strong and yet gentle was her face! I thought.
How steady and clear were her eyes!  How sweet
and expressive the large, sensitive mouth!
</p>

<p>
"I want to say good-bye to you alone&mdash;not
before the others.  I want to thank you, little,
patient Marguerite, for all your goodness to me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Jane," I said, "if you utter another word I shall
weep, and then my eyes will be red.  Be merciful
to me."
</p>

<p>
"God bless you and keep you!" she murmured
with a great earnestness, and then she bowed her
head for a moment, and I knew that she was praying.
</p>

<p>
Mother forced an entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Peter has hidden my bonnet"&mdash;her air was
tragic&mdash;"and I can't find him, he has hidden
himself as well."
</p>

<p>
"He was under the pine tree in the hall when I
last saw him," said Jane.  "He may have slipped
behind the clock."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go and see," said mother breathlessly, "I
shall never be ready in time.  The carriages are
due now."  Mother and Peter were to have one to
themselves, and Dimbie was to take Jane.
</p>

<p>
She was back in a moment.
</p>

<p>
"I've got it.  Amelia found it.  He says he never
touched it, and that it was the Help."
</p>

<p>
And now Dimbie came banging at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Time's up," he shouted.  "How much longer
are you going to prink, Jane?"  Then popping his
head in, "Peter will be smashing the wedding
presents if you don't all hurry up."
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready.  What do you think of your wife,
sir?" said Jane.
</p>

<p>
I covered my face with my hands at the look in
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Wheel me to the drawing-room," I whispered
to him, "you don't go so fast as Amelia; and put
me right in the window, so that I may see you all
coming down the path."
</p>

<p>
"What a lovely Marguerite!" he murmured,
shutting the door.  "I must kiss my little wife.
Why, even your cushions are gold!  You look like
a golden lily."
</p>

<p>
"The carriages are waiting," I said.
</p>

<p>
"I shall come home the very minute I have
given Jane away; I shan't wait to the end.  You will
be lonely."
</p>

<p>
And Dimbie little knew how earnestly during the
next quarter of an hour I longed for the loneliness he
had predicted.  Never had I more fervently yearned
to be by myself, for as soon as ever Jane and Dimbie
had driven away the Help appeared.  She came
slowly and deliberately into the room and seated
herself on a chair opposite to the couch.  She wore
the black crêpe bonnet, a black dress, black kid
gloves, and she carried a black parasol and a prayer-book.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon," I said politely.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon," she returned.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going&mdash;to a funeral?"
</p>

<p>
She stared at me with hard, black eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I've come to the reception."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Master said me and 'Melia could hear their
health drunk&mdash;the bride and bridegroom's."
</p>

<p>
"But they are not here yet."
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, still staring at me unwaveringly.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Amelia?"  The Help alarmed me.
</p>

<p>
"'Melia's gone to the wedding, and then she's
going to run 'ome before the others to make the
tea and coffee."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't you make it?" I cried with sudden relief.
</p>

<p>
"No, 'Melia's going to make it.  She said I was
to look after you and see that you wanted for
nothin'."
</p>

<p>
"I don't require anything, thank you; if I do, I
will ring."
</p>

<p>
She did not move.
</p>

<p>
I closed my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I do not require anything at present, thank
you," I repeated.
</p>

<p>
There was no movement, and I opened my eyes.
The Help was still staring at me unflinchingly&mdash;not
a flicker of an eyelid, not a movement of a muscle.
</p>

<p>
I felt I was going to scream.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think,&mdash;perhaps, it would be advisable&mdash;will
you be so good as to see to the potatoes?"
</p>

<p>
I clasped and unclasped my hands feverishly.
</p>

<p>
"What pertaters?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;the potatoes we are going to eat."
</p>

<p>
"We're not goin' to eat no pertaters.  'Melia
never told me.  There's to be tea, coffee, jelly, and
champagne."
</p>

<p>
"But shan't we require some later on with our
dinner?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"It's to be 'igh tea.  There'll be no time for dinner."
</p>

<p>
"But I should like potatoes."
</p>

<p>
The Help looked doubtful.
</p>

<p>
"I love potatoes."
</p>

<p>
"I'll ask 'Melia when she comes in."
</p>

<p>
"There is no occasion to ask Amelia.  Won't you
go now, please, Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
She still stared at me steadfastly.
</p>

<p>
"There's plenty of time; pertaters only takes half
an hour."
</p>

<p>
"It's not enough," I cried sharply.
</p>

<p>
"I've boiled 'undreds of 'em&mdash;Skerry blues,
magnums, queen of them all, Cheshires&mdash;none of
'em takes more than half an hour."
</p>

<p>
I closed my eyes and clung to the tortoise.  "Oh,
when would Dimbie come?" I moaned to myself.
I lay thus for some minutes.  It seemed ridiculous,
absurd to be frightened of a mere Help.  I told
myself this over and over again.  At length I
ventured to open one eye.  I longed to know if the
Help were still staring at me.  She was, and I
shut it again quickly.  What was I to do?  When
would the wedding be over?  I opened my eye
again.  The Help was staring harder than ever.
Most wickedly I wished that she could be struck
dead by lightning.  But it was unlikely, the day
was brilliantly fine and sunny.  Now I put a
handkerchief over my eyes.  I would not look at the
Help.  The gate banged.  I heard Dimbie's step,
and he came into the room, but I dare not remove
the handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he cried anxiously.  "Are you
poorly, Marguerite?"
</p>

<p>
"Come here," I said.
</p>

<p>
He stooped down.
</p>

<p>
"Is the Help still staring?" I whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Can you get her out of the room?"
</p>

<p>
He began to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Can you?" I repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"Well, do so quickly, please."
</p>

<p>
His voice rang out pleasantly and commandingly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Will you go and tell Amelia, please, that when
the carriage returns I shall be glad if she will give
the coachmen some dinner&mdash;some meat and potatoes."
</p>

<p>
Would the Help think that we were all in a
conspiracy to make her boil potatoes?
</p>

<p>
"'Melia is not here."
</p>

<p>
"Where is she?"
</p>

<p>
"At the weddin'."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, you go and get the dinner ready,
please."
</p>

<p>
She looked at her black dress and gloves and
parasol.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know as there was to be cookin'.  I've
got my best dress on."
</p>

<p>
"You can put on an apron," I said gently.
</p>

<p>
She wavered.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie opened the door for her as he would have
opened it for a duchess, and looked at her.
</p>

<p>
She rose, carefully placed her parasol and prayer-book
on the chair in order to reserve it for future
use, and unwillingly went out of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Move the chair quickly," I gasped, "and hide
the parasol and prayer-book.  That woman must
never be permitted to stare at me again or I shall go
mad.  How could you tell her that she might come
in to hear the health of the bride and bridegroom
drunk?"
</p>

<p>
"She asked me.  What could I say?" said Dimbie
ruefully.
</p>

<p>
"And dressed up as though she were going to a
funeral&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dimbie began to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"And is she going to hand tea to the guests in
a crêpe bonnet?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't say, you are the mistress of the house."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dimbie, what shall I do?  I daren't tell
her to remove it."
</p>

<p>
"Wait till Amelia comes home.  She'll manage her."
</p>

<p>
Amelia came rushing through the gate, and I
signalled to her from the window.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mum!"
</p>

<p>
"The Help is&mdash;wearing a crêpe bonnet.  I
thought you said she was to wear a cap and collar
and cuffs?"
</p>

<p>
"So she is, mum.  She must have slipped into
that bonnet the minute my back was turned.  She'll
be out of it in a jiffy, I'll see to that.  She's that
deceitful, she'll wear me into my grave.  And the
weddin' was <i>that</i> beautiful!  Miss Fairbrother
looked&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I think I hear a carriage," I interrupted; and
Amelia miraculously flew into her cap and apron,
and the next moment announced&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Doctor and Mrs. Renton."
</p>

<p>
Jane advanced to the couch with outstretched
hands.  Her eyes were shining and her lips smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Did your husband swear?" I asked as she
kissed me.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," said the Doctor.  "How's my
patient to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite well, thank you," I replied.  "Now that
you've got Jane safely tied up you'll begin to
remember that you have some patients hanging on
your words.  Jane, he mustn't let his practice go
to the wall.  You have to live, you know."
</p>

<p>
"There's another carriage," said Dimbie, looking
through the window.  "Ah, and here's Nanty!&mdash;what
a howling swell!&mdash;and a whole host of people
I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Jane, I am frightened of Miss Rebecca Sharp.
Stand by me when you introduce us.  I am not
used to Suffragettes," I said.
</p>

<p>
And a most delightful half-hour followed, while
we discussed Jane's and Amelia's united efforts at
refreshments.  Dimbie would not permit my
being wheeled to the refreshment-room and noise,
so my cake and champagne were brought to the
drawing-room, and I was entertained in turn by
Nanty and Professor Leighrail, the Doctor and
Jane, Miss Rebecca Sharp, who was most mild
and unassuming, Mr. Tom Renton, the best man,
who ran to a heavy moustache and pimples, and
even Peter came for a moment to give me his opinion
of Amelia's jelly.
</p>

<p>
Nanty and the Professor interested me greatly.
She, resplendent in purple velvet and old lace, was
composed and sarcastic; he genial, happy, and
detached.
</p>

<p>
"Down with all weddings!" was the gist of her
conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Do all you can to encourage them," said the
Professor cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"Disillusionment and misery are the inevitable
sequence."  Nanty nibbled at the almond on a
piece of wedding-cake.
</p>

<p>
"Happiness and a fuller life are the natural
result."  The Professor waved his glass in the air.
</p>

<p>
She regarded him with amusement.
</p>

<p>
"And you really think so?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, madam."
</p>

<p>
"You are optimistic."
</p>

<p>
"There was a time when I believed that the
world contained no happiness."
</p>

<p>
"And now?"
</p>

<p>
"Now I am older, and think that most people are
as happy as they will allow themselves to be."
</p>

<p>
"But the sin, the suffering?"
</p>

<p>
"Many sufferers are happy."  (His glance rested
for a second upon me.)  "And as for the sinners&mdash;well,
surely they wouldn't sin if they didn't enjoy it?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not agree with your philosophy."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I am open to argument."
</p>

<p>
"The room is too warm for discussion."
</p>

<p>
"It is pleasant in the garden, and there are some
late roses.  Will you come?"
</p>

<p>
Nanty hesitated.
</p>

<p>
He held out his arm.
</p>

<p>
"The sunshine is inviting."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it is," she admitted; and laying a
beautifully-gloved hand lightly upon his arm, she
went out with him.
</p>

<p>
Dimbie came in and found me smiling.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, girl?"
</p>

<p>
His eyes followed mine through the window.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"He asked her to go and look at the roses."
</p>

<p>
"And now I suppose you are happy?"
</p>

<p>
"Nanty's and the Professor's desire for roses does
not affect my happiness," I said gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Liar!" He laughed, stroking my hair.
</p>

<p>
And now the bride and bridegroom came to say
"good-bye."  The Doctor held back while Jane
kissed me and said, "I'll come back soon, little old
pupil; and I will drive over the day after our return
and tell you everything."  Her eyes were full of
unshed tears.  The Doctor held my hand in a
strong, close grip, and they were gone.
</p>

<p>
Through the window I could see everyone
assembled on the path.  Confetti was in the air,
congratulations, good-byes.  The Help with her cap all
askew, into which Amelia had insisted upon her
changing, hurled rice and a slipper at the retreating
cab.  And so Jane and the Doctor drove away to
happiness.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
</h3>

<h4>
THE DEATH OF A LITTLE BLACK CHICKEN
</h4>

<p>
A day has come, still, cold and grey, when you
say, "There is snow in the air," and you are
not sorry.  The first snow is curiously attractive.
Before, you are a little doubtful as to the season.
Is it late autumn&mdash;there are still a few leaves on
the beech tree&mdash;or has winter arrived?  You would
like to know; you object to being in uncertainty
about your seasons.  And then the snow comes one
night very softly but very surely, and you wake in
the morning to find that the thing is accomplished&mdash;winter
has come.  Your furs are reached out,
your last thin frock is laid away, your eider-downs
are aired, and you are quite resigned, you have no
regrets.  The summer brought you treasures in
abundance, scattered largess with prodigal hand.
But winter is no niggard.  It gives you branches of
trees stripped of their greenery, but beautiful in
their form and shape.  You had forgotten that the
apple tree had a delicious crook here, a bend of the
knee there, and a graceful arm with finely-turned
wrist held out to its neighbours in the field in a
spirit of friendship.  And winter gives you brown
fields&mdash;sad, you were about to say, but your pen
halts at the word.  They are not sad, they are but
resting and waiting.  "All things must rest."  Those
quiet, brown fields have done their work,
they have yielded great riches, they have given of
their best.  Now is their season of peace, and they
will be ready after their winter sleep for more work.
</p>

<p>
Winter gives you red suns and clear, frosty nights.
It gives you the friendship of little birds who in
summer are shy and not to be won.  You are not
deceived by their sudden overtures; it is not you,
you know.  It is the cocoa-nut hanging in front of
the window, and the crumbs on the lawn, and the
succulent bit of mutton-fat suspended from the
apple tree.  But you are glad to have them at any
price; the tits' joyful chatter and the wrens' hurried
warble, and the clear, sweet note of the robin
enliven the atmosphere.  They make no pretence of
being fine musicians, like their sometime friend
the thrush; but they say, "What's the good of being
a singer if you keep your mouth or bill shut for
six months in the year?"  And I smile behind
my hand and partly agree with them, though I
dare not let the thrush hear me.  I gave him a
great welcome in the spring, and he would think me
faithless were I now to speak of him disparagingly.
</p>

<p>
And winter brings in its wake great glowing fires
and warm, lamplit rooms, and a feeling of snug
cosiness when the curtains are drawn.
</p>

<p>
They have pushed my couch close to the fire, for
I am a shivery mortal these days, and from my
corner I can see the grey sky, the still, bare trees,
and I can feel the hush in the air which ever
precedes the snow.
</p>

<p>
Anxiously I hope that Dimbie will be home
before it comes, for he is many miles from here&mdash;gone
at my request to satisfy a longing, a desire of
mine which has been with me for many weeks,
which has lain very close to my heart, and which
has now become so insistent that it cannot be
hushed.  It has been with me by day, I have
whispered it in the long hours of the night, "How fares
the tiny black chicken?"  Has it suffered, lived on
since that cruel moment when my bicycle crushed it
to earth, or was its life snatched away from it?  If
it has lived it will be a big chicken now.  The soft
down will have become feathers, the wee legs will
have grown long and thin.
</p>

<p>
This morning I found courage to voice my request,
to tell Dimbie of my longing.  At the first
word he started, and his face became set.  He
walked to the window and drummed on the panes.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mind, Dimbie?  You'll go for me?"
I pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"But why?  Why do you want to know?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell," I replied.  "It may be silly,
morbid, but I feel as though&mdash;one or two things
might be made clear to me if I knew."
</p>

<p>
He did not speak for a long time.  His back was
to me, and I could not see his face.  Presently he
said, without looking round, "I'll go.  I cannot
refuse you anything, Marg.  But I don't like it.
The chicken may be gone."
</p>

<p>
"Gone?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;dead."
</p>

<p>
"And if it is," I said softly, "I shan't mind.  I
shall know&mdash;and be satisfied."
</p>

<p>
He came and knelt by the couch.
</p>

<p>
"But won't you be lonely, girl?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"Are you better to-day, sweetheart?  Do you
think you are any stronger?  That wedding was
too much for you."
</p>

<p>
Each day my dear one abuses poor Jane's wedding.
I had been overtired that night, faint, with a
singing in my cars and the sound of many waters
surging around me.  And each day also he says,
"You are a little stronger, I think, don't you?"  But
he does not wait for an answer.  Sometimes
it is better to leave a question unanswered.
</p>

<p>
Oh, my husband, will you ever know, ever
understand how much happiness you have given to me?
Before I knew you life was an arid wilderness.  I
was but young, but there was always Peter.  Afterwards
I came to a garden of roses and lilies set about
with the tender green of spring.  And <i>our</i> year!
How wonderful it has been!  Sorrow came to us,
but joy entered a little later.  Sorrow we thrust
forth, and joy crept still closer, and has remained
with us even to the end.  Sorrow will dog Dimbie's
footsteps for a little season, but joy will triumph
over all&mdash;"for here we have no continuing city."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Dimbie came home as the first snowflake brushed
the window-pane.  In the firelight he knelt and told
me of the strange thing that had happened.  He
found the cottage, and as he entered the little
chicken turned over on its side, stretched its legs
and died.  A child with golden hair leaned over it
and wept bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"And had it suffered?" I whispered.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"The woman said not, but it was lamed.  The
child from the day of the accident cared for it,
tended it, nursed it.  It slept in a box in the kitchen,
and became very tame.  The woman is a widow,
and this little one the only child."
</p>

<p>
"Did you tell her of&mdash;me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Dimbie gently.
</p>

<p>
I laid my cheek to his, and he stroked my hair
in his old, dear fashion.  And we sat thus, and
once again told each other the old, old story of our
love.  The soft snow brushed the window-pane,
the corners of the room became shadowy and mysterious,
and hand in hand we waited for the light which
always follows the darkness.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap31"></a></p>

<h3>
AN AFTERWORD
</h3>

<p>
The pen has fallen from Marguerite's hand
never again to be taken up.  And we who
wait for the lifting of the veil find it hard not to
question the why and the wherefore.
</p>

<p>
Hers was a beautiful, blameless life.  Her suffering
was borne with a great patience and cheerfulness,
and we cry and cry again, "Why should this be?"
</p>

<p>
Jane Renton's philosophy is simple: "God wanted
her more than we."
</p>

<p>
But to me it seems such love as theirs&mdash;of
husband and wife&mdash;should have been allowed to
continue yet a little while longer.  Jane says it will
outlast the ages.  To Jane has been given a faith,
an understanding which has been withheld from
many.  Her eyes can see while ours are blinded
with tears.
</p>

<p>
I have her husband's sanction to give her simple
story to the world.  "It may help to brighten the
life of some other sufferer, and she would be glad,"
I said, and he bowed his head.
</p>

<p>
The last night of her life was one of silver, as she
herself would have described it, for the moon turned
the earth with its soft mantle of snow into silver
sheen.  We drew back the curtains and pushed
the bed still nearer to the window.  Dimbie's arms
pillowed her head.  From unconsciousness she
kept creeping back to moments of consciousness,
and she would speak a little.  Once she murmured
something about a little black chicken, and always
the word "Dimbie" was upon her lips.  At the
last we left them alone.  By and by Dimbie came
out of the room and passed out into the moonlit
night.  She would be glad that it was so, that there
was the moonlight, and that while her spirit winged
its way to eternal light there was a reflection of its
brightness left for her Dimbie.

BRUVVER JIM'S BABY.  By Philip Verrill Mighels.
</p>

<p>
An uproariously funny story of a tiny mining settlement in the
West, which is shaken to the very roots by the sudden possession
of a baby, found on the plains by one of its residents.  The town is
as disreputable a spot as the gold fever was ever responsible for,
and the coming of that baby causes the upheaval of every rooted
tradition of the place.  Its christening, the problems of its toys and
its illness supersede in the minds of the miners all thought of earthy
treasure.

<p>
This marvelously vivid narrative turns upon the search of a
German musician in New York for his little daughter.  Mr. Klein has

THE KINDRED OF THE WILD.  A Book of Animal Life.
With illustrations by Charles Livingston Bull.
</p>

<p>
Appeals alike to the young and to the merely youthful-hearted.
Close observation.  Graphic description.  We get a sense of the
great wild and its denizens.  Out of the common.  Vigorous and full
of character.  The book is one to be enjoyed; all the more because
it smacks of the forest instead of the museum.  John Burroughs says:

THE HEART OF THE ANCIENT WOOD.  Illustrated.
</p>

<p>
This book strikes a new note in literature.  It is a realistic romance
of the folk of the forest&mdash;a romance of the alliance of peace between
a pioneer's daughter in the depths of the ancient wood and the wild
beasts who felt her spell and became her friends.  It is not fanciful,
with talking beasts; nor is it merely an exquisite idyl of the beasts
themselves.  It is an actual romance, in which the animal characters
play their parts as naturally as do the human.  The atmosphere of
the book is enchanting.  The reader feels the undulating, whimpering
music of the forest, the power of the shady silences, the dignity of the
beasts who live closest to the heart of the wood.

This powerful novel is the fictitious narrative of a deal in the
Chicago wheat pit and holds the reader from the beginning.  In a masterly
way the author has grasped the essential spirit of the great city by the
lakes.  The social existence, the gambling in stocks and produce, the
characteristic life in Chicago, form a background for an exceedingly
vigorous and human tale of modern life and love.

A story which has for a heroine a girl decidedly out of the ordinary
run of fiction.  It is most dramatic, containing some tremendous
pictures of the daring of the men who are trying to reach the Pole * * *
but it is at the same time essentially a <i>woman's</i> book, and the story
works itself out in the solution of a difficulty that is continually
presented in real life&mdash;the wife's attitude in relation to her husband when
both have well-defined careers.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
