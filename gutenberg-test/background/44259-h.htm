<h2>WILLIAM DWIGHT WHITNEY.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>

<p>Northampton, Massachusetts, half a century ago, was one of
the best examples of a typical New England town&mdash;among
stately hills, on the banks of the Connecticut River, with broad
streets well shaded by great spreading elms, with large homesteads
still occupied by the descendants of early settlers, with
people of much culture and refinement who were given to "plain
living and high thinking." It was the town of Edwards, of
Dwight, of Hawley, of Stoddard, of Strong, and of many another
worthy. It was the seat of the once famous Round Hill Academy.
There, on February 9, 1827, William Dwight Whitney was born,&mdash;the
second surviving son and fourth child of Josiah Dwight
Whitney and Sarah Williston Whitney. His mother was a
daughter of the Rev. Payson Williston (Yale, 1783), of Easthampton,
and sister of the Hon. Samuel Williston, who founded
Williston Seminary. His father was born in Westfield, Mass.,&mdash;the
oldest son of Abel Whitney, who was graduated at Harvard
in 1783.</p>

<p>No company of brothers and sisters of any American family
has been so remarkable for scholarly attainments and achievements
as that family in Northampton: Josiah D. Whitney, Jr.
(Yale, 1839), Professor of Geology at Harvard; William D.
Whitney, of Yale; James L. Whitney (Yale, 1856), of the Boston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Public Library; Henry M. Whitney (Yale, 1864), Professor of
English Literature at Beloit College; Miss Maria Whitney, the
first incumbent of the chair of Modern Languages in Smith
College.</p>

<p>William D. Whitney was fitted for college in his native town,
and entered the Sophomore class of Williams College in 1842,
at the age of fifteen. Tradition says that the studies of the
college course were easy to him, and that he spent most of his
time in wandering over the fields, studying geology and the
habits of birds and of plants, although he maintained the first
rank for scholarship in his class. On his graduation he pronounced
the valedictory oration, on 'Literary Biography.'</p>

<p>After graduation&mdash;at eighteen, the age when most now enter
college&mdash;Mr. Whitney remained for three years in uncertainty
with regard to his life-work, meanwhile busy as teller in his
father's bank. He did not take an active part in the social life of
the young people of Northampton, but employed himself in his
own pursuits. His leisure time was given largely to the collection
of birds and plants; a large and beautiful case of birds
stuffed by him at this period is in the Peabody Museum at New
Haven. His tastes for natural science were marked, and he was
more than an amateur in that field. He spent the summer of
1849 in the United States Survey of the Lake Superior region,
conducted by his eminent brother, Josiah D. Whitney&mdash;having
"under his charge the botany, the ornithology, and the accounts."
In the summer of 1873, also, he was invited to take part in the
Hayden exploring expedition in Colorado. The Report of the
Survey says that he "rendered most valuable assistance ... in
geographical work." His account of this expedition of 1873 was
published in the New York <cite>Tribune</cite>, and afterwards was translated
into French for a popular publication of that country, as
giving a clear view of the work of such scientific parties. He
had a brief article in the <cite>American Journal of Science</cite> for the
same year on the U.&nbsp;S. Geological Survey of the Territories.
He gave several months of his time just before leaving home for
his last visit to Europe, to helping Professor J.&nbsp;D. Whitney put
through the press the latter's work on 'The Metallic Wealth of
the United States.'</p>

<p>His scientific experience stood him in good stead in more than
one instance of philological research and discussion. He was not
tempted to infer from linguistic data the order of succession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
trees in forests, nor astronomical facts. He was a member for
several years of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science. One of his most important publications was the
annotated translation of a Hindu treatise on astronomy&mdash;the
Sūrya-Siddhānta, 1860&mdash;and one of the longest essays in his
'Oriental and Linguistic Studies' treats of the same subject.</p>

<p>In 1848, largely under the influence and with the encouragement
of his father's pastor, the Rev. George E. Day (for a quarter of a
century after 1866 Professor of Hebrew at Yale, and at present
Dean of the Yale Divinity School), Mr. Whitney directed his
attention to the study of Sanskrit, for which he found books in
the library of his elder brother, who had recently returned from
Europe. A really good mind can find pleasure and success in
any one of several different fields of research. Not often, however,
do we find such marked examples of men of real talent
manifesting distinct tastes and power in widely different departments
of learning as in the case of these two brothers. Mr. J.&nbsp;D.
Whitney went to Germany primarily in order to prepare himself
for mineralogical and geological work, but became interested in
the study of languages and attended (with but two fellow-listeners)
a course of lectures on Sanskrit at Berlin. He himself says that
he might have taken up philology in earnest, abandoning natural
science altogether, if immediately after his return to his home he
had not received an appointment to engage in a geological survey
of a new and interesting region under United States authority.
His philological studies have borne fruit in his 'Names and
Places&mdash;Studies in Geographical and Topographical Nomenclature,'
published in 1888, and in the more than four thousand
definitions he furnished to the Century Dictionary. Mr. W.&nbsp;D.
Whitney certainly had great ability in the study of natural
science. Doubtless the accident of his finding various linguistic
books ready to hand, at the time when his mental powers were
most actively developing, had much to do with his turning in the
direction of philology. During the summer which he spent with
his brother on Lake Superior he had a Sanskrit grammar with
him, which he studied at odd moments when not engaged in
collecting plants or computing barometrical observations. Yale
College has had another marked example of a scholar with equal
ability and tastes for widely diverse studies, in Professor James
Hadley, whose first published work was in the department of
mathematics, and of whom a high authority said that the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
mathematician in the country was spoiled when Mr. Hadley
devoted himself to Greek!</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney's practical banker father was not fully satisfied
with his plan of giving himself to Oriental studies, and asked his
pastor whether a man could support himself in life by studying
and teaching Sanskrit. Dr. Day made the very wise answer that
if a man had any exact and thorough knowledge, he was likely
to be able to use it. As a Massachusetts man, the father turned
naturally to Harvard as the proper place for his son's pursuit of
advanced studies, but his pastor called his attention to the newly
established department of Philosophy and the Arts at New Haven
as the only definite arrangement yet made in this country for
university work, and especially to the unique equipment of the
special department of Oriental languages.</p>

<p>Before going to New Haven to study, Mr. Whitney prepared
and published in the <cite>Bibliotheca Sacra</cite> an article (translated and
abridged from von Bohlen) on the 'Grammatical Structure of the
Sanskrit'; and in the same periodical, in the following year, he
published a 'Comparison of the Greek and Latin Verbs.'</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1849, too late for his name to appear in the
catalogue of that year, Mr. Whitney came to Yale and studied
through the remainder of the college year under Professor Salisbury.
His associate in study was Professor James Hadley (six
years older than himself, but only three years older in college
age), who had been appointed assistant professor of Greek in
1848. The relations of the two continued most intimate and
mutually stimulating until the death of Professor Hadley in 1872.
Mr. Whitney edited a volume of Professor Hadley's Essays, in
1873, and wrote a brief but highly appreciative sketch of his
friend for the large work entitled 'Yale College,' published in 1879.</p>

<p>Professor Salisbury was graduated at Yale in 1832. During
more than three years' residence abroad, 1836-39, he studied
with De Sacy and Garcin de Tassy in Paris and with Bopp in
Berlin. In 1841 he was invited to a professorship of the Arabic
and Sanskrit languages in Yale College, without the expectation
of pecuniary compensation. This was only nine years after the
foundation of the Sanskrit professorship (of H.&nbsp;H. Wilson) at
Oxford, and twelve years after Lassen was made Professor
Extraordinarius at Bonn. He returned to Europe in 1842 for a
year, and read <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">privatissime</i> Arabic with Freytag and Sanskrit
with Lassen, at Bonn. In 1846 he was made the Corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Secretary of the American Oriental Society, and (to use Mr.
Whitney's words) "for some ten years Professor Salisbury was
virtually the Society, doing its work and paying its bills. He
gave it standing and credit in the world of scholars, as an organization
that could originate and make public valuable material;
after such a start, it was sure of respectful attention to whatever it
might do." The Society had published nothing before he took
charge of this office. Professor Salisbury also secured valuable
Arabic and Sanskrit manuscripts and books from De Sacy's
library and elsewhere in Europe; and Professor FitzEdward
Hall, then at Benares, procured for him many expensive and
important Sanskrit publications from India. His services and
generosity in procuring fonts of Oriental type, and his wisdom
in bringing the Oriental Society into close connection with the
studies of foreign missionaries, should not be forgotten. He was
the only trained Orientalist in this country, until Mr. Whitney's
return in 1853, and had an admirably equipped library. In the
Yale catalogue of 1841-42, Professor Salisbury's name appears
for the first time in the list of the faculty as Professor of the
Arabic and Sanskrit Languages and Literature. In the catalogue
of 1843-44, announcement is made that "the Professor of Arabic
and Sanskrit will give instruction on Tuesdays and Wednesdays
in Arabic grammar with the interpretation of the Korân and the
Mo'allakas, and on Fridays and Saturdays in Sanskrit grammar
with the interpretation of the laws of Manu." In the following
year we are told that "the Professor of Arabic and Sanskrit
proposes to commence this year, in the ensuing summer, a free
course of lectures on the Sacred Code of the Hindus, the Manava
Dharma Sastra." In 1845 for the first time appears a modestly-placed
paragraph, saying "Instruction is also given by the Professors
to Resident Graduates, provided a sufficient number
present themselves to form a class." This was followed by the
offer of a "course of lectures on the literary history and doctrines
of the Kurân," or instruction in the elements of Sanskrit. In
1847 appeared the formal announcement of the opening of the
Department of Philosophy and the Arts, with definite arrangements
for advanced work. The philological courses were by
President Woolsey (Thucydides or Pindar), Professor Kingsley
("in such Latin author as may be agreed upon"), Professor
Gibbs ("lectures on some points of general Philology"), and
Professor Salisbury (Arabic Grammar, and "some of the relations
of the Arabic to other of the Shemitish dialects").</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Marvellous stories are told in student-tradition of the rapid
progress made by Mr. Whitney and Mr. Hadley&mdash;that they
learned all the paradigms of Bopp's grammar in two lessons, etc.
The basis of the stories is partly the fact that both already read
simple Sanskrit with ease, but it is certain that few teachers ever
had such a class. They were Professor Salisbury's first and last
pupils in Sanskrit, but he might well feel proud of the record.
He himself says of them that "their quickness of perception and
unerring exactness of acquisition soon made it evident that the
teacher and the taught must change places."</p>

<p>In 1850 Mr. Whitney went to Germany and spent three winter
semesters in studying with Weber, Bopp, and Lepsius in Berlin,
and two summer semesters at work with Roth in Tübingen. At
the suggestion of Roth he undertook with this master the publication
of the Atharva-Veda, and copied and collated the Berlin
MSS of this work. In 1852 he sent to the American Oriental
Society a paper, read at their October meeting of that year, on
'The main results of the later Vedic researches in Germany.' A
letter from Weber, dated at Berlin, Dec. 28, 1852, is interesting
in this connection on several accounts. He writes: "I hope ere
long Sanskrit studies will flourish in America more than in
England, where with the only exception of the venerable and
not-to-be-praised-enough Professor Wilson nobody seems to care
for them so much as to devote his life to them. The East India
Company certainly does all that is in its power to help the publication
of the Vedic texts, but it does not find English hands to
achieve it.... It is certainly very discouraging to see that Professor
Wilson during all the time since he got his professorship
in Oxford, has not succeeded in bringing up even one Sanskrit
scholar who might claim to be regarded as one who has done at
least some little service to our Sanskrit philology.... I have to
congratulate you most heartily on your countryman Mr. Whitney,
who is now intensely engaged in the preparations for an edition
of the Atharva Samhitā in union with Professor Roth of Tübingen.
The next number of the <cite>Indische Studien</cite>, too, which is
now in press, contains from him tables showing the natural
relation of the four now known Samhitās of the Veda,&mdash;an
attempt in which he was greatly indebted to Professor Roth's
communications, but which still remains also a very favorable
specimen of his own assiduity and correctness."</p>

<p>The following letters need little explanation. We note with
interest how soon the first followed the receipt of Weber's letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
which has just been quoted. The spirit which prompted the offer
of the first letter is certainly unusual in its generosity&mdash;not only
surrendering a professorial chair, but also providing for its endowment.
The modesty and delicacy of the reply seem as extraordinary
at the present day, and were perhaps as rare forty years
ago.</p>

<p>Under date of February 19, 1853, Professor Salisbury wrote to
Mr. Whitney: "... I have observed your course of study and
the rapidity of your acquisitions since you have been abroad with
much interest and have seen in this, together with what I have
known otherwise of your tastes and talents, a way opening for
relief to myself which I have long desired. The prospect has
been the more pleasing to me inasmuch as I have also seen that
I might be able through you to bring new honor to my 'alma
mater.'... It is also much at heart with me to secure ... assistance
to myself in editing and endeavouring in every way to
improve the Journal of the Oriental Society." Professor Salisbury
proposed that Mr. Whitney should be made "Professor of
the Sanskrit and its relations to the kindred languages, and of
Sanskrit literature, in the Department of Philosophy and the Arts
in Yale College," his term of service to begin Aug. 8, 1853;&mdash;it
being understood that Mr. Whitney would include in his instructions
the teaching of modern languages to undergraduates, and
should receive the fees which were then paid for such teaching.
It was understood, further, that Mr. Whitney would co-operate
with Professor Salisbury in editing the Journal of the Oriental
Society. Professor Salisbury undertook to create a fund which
with the fees for modern-language instruction might furnish
nearly the ordinary salary of a Yale professor at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney replied from Paris, on April 4, 1853. Professor
Salisbury's letter had reached him at Berlin at a time when he
was engaged in closing his work there, and "had hardly an hour
for quiet thought upon any subject." He expressed his gratitude
for the kind feeling toward him "which has had a share in the
dictating of the proposal," and continued: "Nor can I well say
how much I am struck by the true and self-forgetting zeal for the
progress of Oriental studies, of which this, like all your previous
movements, affords an evidence. But ... I am compelled to ask
myself whether ... I can hope to render any such service to
Science as would be an adequate return for the kindness you
exhibit toward me; whether, finally, it would not be in me an act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of unpardonable presumption to take upon my shoulders an office
which you are desirous of throwing off.... I need not say how
high and honorable a post I regard that of a teacher at Yale to
be, how many and extreme attractions, both in a personal and in
a scientific point of view, the prospect of such a situation would
have for me.... So far as my own interests are concerned, I
could find nothing in the terms which you propose or the duties
which you suggest to which to raise a moment's objection....
All that I could bring up against the arrangement would be that
the advantage is too entirely upon my side." He desired further
time for reflection and consultation with his friends, and thought
the postponement of a decision less objectionable because he did
not expect to be able to finish his work in Europe and return
before the last of August, and then, after a three years' absence
from home, desired to spend some time with his friends. His
eyes, too, had been giving him "during the winter ground for
some apprehension," and "would doubtless be best consulted for
by a period of rest and inaction."</p>

<p>In Paris he was "at work on a MS of the Atharva which
belongs to the Imperial Library." "Probably it will cost me
about six weeks' labor.... Then will follow two or three months
of similar labor in London and Oxford.... During the whole
winter I was compelled to neglect all other studies; that, however,
chiefly owing to the condition of my eyes, which robbed
me of about half my time. Persian and Arabic had to be laid
aside altogether, and what of time and strength I had to spare
from the Sanskrit, I devoted to the Egyptian and Coptic. I
cannot well express to you the interest which this latter branch
of study has awakened in me, and the strong desire I have felt
to penetrate further into it than the mere surface exploration
which could be made in the odd moments of a single winter. I
would not, however, sell for a very large sum the little insight
into this wonderful subject which I have already obtained, and
it will be my highest pleasure to attempt to draw it somewhat
more into the circle of our Oriental inquiries than has been
generally the case hitherto.... There is nothing new of particular
interest, so far as I know, to communicate to you from
the Sanskrit world on this side of the water. The main interest
attaches to the Lexicon which is going to be really a great work,
and to push forward the whole study of that language a long way
with one thrust. A slow thrust, unfortunately, it will have to be;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Prof. Roth estimates ten years as needed for its perfection. [It
was completed in 1875.] I am going to contribute my small
mite also toward it, by furnishing to Prof. Roth the vocabulary
complete of the Atharva. The latter, as you perhaps know, has
now the sole redaction of the Vedic material, Aufrecht having left
Germany. The next number of Weber's Zeitschrift will be out
now very soon, and will contain a contribution from me, a Vedic
concordance."</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney reached home earlier than he had expected&mdash;about
Aug. 8, 1853&mdash;and on Aug. 15 he wrote: "Although not
less distrustful than before of my ability to discharge to your
satisfaction and my own the duties of the post to which you
would assign me, I should be disposed to accept gratefully your
proposals, and do my best at least to accomplish that which such
an acceptance demands of me." But Mr. Whitney desired a
modification of the plan. "I have no such knowledge of French
as would in any manner justify me in making pretensions to
ability to teach it." His estimate of his knowledge of modern
languages was lower than that of his friends. Not until 1856 did
he accept the title of "Instructor in German." A year later,
after he had taken nine months of travel and study in southern
Europe, the college catalogue calls him "Professor of Sanskrit,
and Instructor in modern languages."</p>

<p>The importance to American scholarship of the offer of this
chair to Professor Whitney may be better appreciated if we
remember that his predecessor still lives, and that no other chair
of Sanskrit was established in this country for about a quarter of
a century.</p>

<p>At a special meeting of the Corporation of Yale College, on
May 10, 1854, the "Professorship of the Sanskrit and its relations
to kindred languages, and Sanskrit Literature" was established,
and Mr. Whitney was elected to hold it. The founder's desire
for the range of the department was indicated distinctly, but the
shorter name of the professorship, "Professor of Sanskrit," was
used in the college catalogues until 1869, when the words "and
Comparative Philology" were added, without indicating any
change in the direction of the incumbent's studies or in the plan
of the university.</p>

<p>In 1854 the announcement of philological courses in the Department
of Philosophy and the Arts covered Professor Gibbs's
lectures on general Philology, Professor Thacher's course of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hours a week in Lucretius and in Latin Composition, Professor
Hadley's course of two hours a week in Pindar or Theocritus,
and contained the following statement: "Professor Whitney will
give instruction in Sanskrit from Bopp's Grammar and Nalus, or
such other text-books as may be agreed upon, and in the rudiments
of the Ancient and Modern Persian, and of the Egyptian
languages." The last clause here reminds the reader of the
enthusiasm for the Egyptian and Coptic expressed in the letter
of April 4, 1853; and of the fact that Mr. Whitney's first 'bibliographical
notice' in the Journal of the Oriental Society discussed
Lepsius's work on the 'First order of Egyptian deities,' but we
read little more of these studies, except a paper on Lepsius's
Nubian Grammar in the second volume of this <cite class="smcap">Journal</cite>. In
1858 Professor Whitney's announcement read: "Professor Whitney
will instruct in the Sanskrit language, and in the History,
Antiquities, and Literature of India and other Oriental countries;
also in the comparative philology of the Indo-European languages,
and the general principles of linguistic study. He will
also give instruction to such as may desire it in the modern
European languages."</p>

<p>The appointment of Professor Whitney in 1854 was for five
years, with a pledge of reappointment "for life," five years later,
if he desired it. In 1859 this reappointment was made&mdash;the
founder of the chair stipulating that Professor Whitney should
be free to retire from the professorship at any time. Mr.
Whitney wrote, on July 15, 1859: "My present situation in New
Haven is so pleasant to me on so many accounts, and holds out
such prospects of honorable and useful employment in the time
to come, that I should exceedingly regret being compelled to go
elsewhere. Nor, although it would be in many respects more
agreeable to me to be able to devote my <em>whole</em> time to my own
peculiar studies, do I see reason seriously to regret the division
of my labors between the ancient and the modern languages. It
is both useful and pleasant to have to do more directly with the
young men in college, and there is also the chance of influencing
one and another of them to devote his attention to higher
philological study."</p>

<p>During and after the Civil War, the ordinary expenses of life
increased, and Mr. Whitney's family was growing. The income
which had sufficed for the young and unmarried professor in
1854 had become entirely insufficient for his needs, with six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
children, in 1870. For his pecuniary relief he assumed additional
duties of instruction in modern languages, in connection with the
Sheffield Scientific School. His teaching of modern languages in
the academic department had ceased with the entrance upon his
duties of Professor Coe, in 1867. The burden of instructing
large classes of undergraduates in the very rudiments of French
and German (each Academic student then having only thirty or
forty lessons in each subject) became more and more irksome.</p>

<p>In September, 1869, Mr. Whitney received an urgent call to
Harvard, very soon after President Eliot's election to the headship
of that university, with the assurance that he should have "salary
enough to constitute a tolerable support," and should not have
to teach in any other than his own proper department. He
wrote to a friend: "It is the most tempting offer that could, so
far as I know, be made me; for on the one hand I have greatly
grudged the time which I have had to steal from Oriental and
linguistic studies for German and French; and, on the other
hand, what I have received for my services to the College has not
for a good while paid more than about half my expenses....
Such a state of things has been, of course, worrying enough, nor
have I seen any definite prospect of a change. But I am greatly
attached to the College here, and to the Scientific School, and to
relatives and friends in New Haven, and have no hope that ... I
should become so wonted and so comfortable anywhere else."</p>

<p>Professor Whitney's colleagues saw how fatal his departure
would be to the advanced philological work at Yale. No definite
provision had then been made for graduate instruction in Greek,
Latin, and Modern Languages, and although Professors Hadley,
Thacher, Packard, and Coe were laboring to build up this department,
their efforts received only the slightest pecuniary compensation;
they were expected to do full work in the undergraduate
department; Mr. Whitney was the only "University professor," not
only at Yale, but in the whole country. One who is everywhere
recognized as a leader in education then wrote: "I am confident
that there is no one whose intellectual influence over the younger
officers of the college is so great as Mr. Whitney's.... I have
greatly admired his influence in promoting fidelity, truth, justice,
and industry among the students, as well as his skill in promoting
their intellectual character." Another of his colleagues wrote:
"I have never known the college men so moved. The danger
of losing so eminent a man as Mr. Whitney seemed almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
appalling, and I think if no other means of retaining him could
be devised, the professors themselves would each cut off a slice
from his meagre salary to make up the amount necessary to
retain him. The question seems to rise above personal considerations
and to come very near to the vital interests of the university."</p>

<p>Professor Salisbury, whose insight and generosity had brought
Mr. Whitney to Yale, was nearly concerned by the call to Cambridge,
and after less than a week's delay provided the sum
needed for the full foundation of Mr. Whitney's chair on the
modern scale of salaries, which had changed greatly since 1854,
and Mr. Whitney decided to remain in New Haven. At this
time the arrangement was made that Mr. Whitney should give
regular instruction in linguistics to the undergraduate classes of
the college, and this course, at first given in the form of lectures,
as part of the required work, was amplified and continued as an
'elective' until 1886. Mr. Whitney still continued to teach in the
Scientific School for an hour a day, saying that in no other way
could he add so easily a convenient thousand dollars a year to his
income as by teaching from eight to nine o'clock each morning;
he required no preparation for the exercise, it did not interfere
with the work of his day, and he liked to be brought into contact
with the young men.</p>

<p>The invitation to Harvard and the decision to remain at Yale
had attracted considerable attention and had given rise to many
plans for advanced philological instruction at New Haven. Mr.
Whitney's release from drudgery with undergraduates enabled
him also to enrich his Sanskrit and linguistic courses. In the
catalogue of 1870-71 we read: "In Philology, a somewhat regular
course of higher study, extending through two years, and leading
to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, is offered. The leading
studies of the first year will be The general principles of linguistic
science, under Professor Whitney; the Sanskrit language, under
Professor Whitney; the older Germanic languages, especially
Gothic and Anglo-Saxon, under Professor Hadley and Mr.
Lounsbury; along with higher instruction in the classical and
the modern languages, according to the special requirements of
each student, under Professors Thacher, Packard, and Coe, and
Messrs. Van Name and Lounsbury, and others. The leading
studies of the second year will be The comparative philology of
the Indo-European languages ... under Professor Whitney; the
history of the English language, under Professor Hadley; along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with other special branches, as during the first year." The reward
for the new enterprise of a formal graduate school of philology
came almost immediately in the form of an unusual class of
students, nearly all of whom were destined to secure honorable
distinction in their chosen work. In the list of those who received
the degree of Ph.D. in 1873 appear the names of Lanman of
Harvard, Learned of the Japanese Doshisha, Luquiens of Yale,
Manatt of Brown, Otis of the Institute of Technology, and Perrin
of Yale. Truly an unusual group! Only the year before, Professor
Easton of the University of Pennsylvania and Professor
Beckwith of Trinity College, and the year following Professor
Edgren of the University of Gothenburg, received the same
degree, while soon after them President Harper of Chicago, Professor
H.&nbsp;P. Wright of Yale, Professor Sherman of Nebraska,
Professor Peters of the University of Pennsylvania, and Professor
Tarbell of the University of Chicago completed the graduate
course under Mr. Whitney. The service which the Semitic
scholar, Professor George E. Day, had done for Indo-European
philology by turning Professor Whitney's mind to its attractions,
was in a way repaid by the latter when he pointed out to William
Rainey Harper the great opportunity open to workers in the
Semitic field; as a graduate student at Yale, Dr. Harper gave
himself to work in the field of the Indo-European languages, but
his recollection of his master's words has had a wide influence on
Semitic studies in America. Professor Whitney was justly proud
of his pupils, and was always interested in their work. His
classes in Sanskrit were not large absolutely, but frequently he
could say that more were studying this language with him than
with any other university professor in the world.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney's connection with the Sheffield Scientific
School was close. He organized its department of modern languages,
and was a member of its 'Governing Board' from the
time of the organization of that body in 1872. One who has
occasion to know better than all others says that he was "a tower
of strength" to the School&mdash;not only by his instructions and by
inspiring the students with the spirit of true scholarship, but by
his intelligent appreciation of the aims of the School and his wise
judgment as to the means to be used in order to attain them.
His personal liking for natural science, and training in its methods,
added the warmest sympathy to his work in connection with this
department of the University.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In the very first communication made to Mr. Whitney with
regard to his work at Yale, attention was called to the opportunity
for usefulness in connection with the American Oriental
Society, of which he was elected a member in 1850. In 1854 his
name appears in the list of the publication committee of that
Society. In 1855 he was made librarian, and held that office
until 1873. This latter post was no sinecure. In the winter of
1853-54, on going to visit the library (then kept in Boston), he
"found it a pile of books on the floor in the corner of an upstairs
room in the Athenaeum, apparently just as it had been brought
in and dumped down from an earlier place of keeping." In the
summer of 1855 the books were removed to New Haven. The
task of "arranging, labelling, entering in the book of donations,
and preparing cards" involved "a very considerable and tedious
amount of work." In 1857, on Professor Salisbury's going abroad
and resigning the office, Professor Whitney was elected Corresponding
Secretary, and continued in this position until 1884,
when he was elected President of the Society. His resignation
of this latter office was not accepted until 1890, when for nearly
four years the condition of his health had obliged him to absent
himself from its meetings. He could well say that "no small
part of his work had been done in the service of the Society";
from 1857 to 1885, "just a half of the contents of its Journal is
from his pen." His care of the publications of others, also, was
specially difficult, in view of the peculiar danger of typographical
errors and the wide field covered by the papers; no ordinary
proof-reader could render much assistance. And not infrequently
articles by those who were unaccustomed to scientific composition
needed thorough revision. On his positively declining to be a
candidate for re-election as President, the Society adopted the
following minute: "The American Oriental Society&mdash;regretfully
accepting his declination&mdash;desires to record its deep sense of
indebtedness to its retiring President, Professor William Dwight
Whitney, of New Haven. For twenty-seven years he has served
as Corresponding Secretary of the Society; for eighteen, as its
Librarian; and for six, as its President. We gratefully acknowledge
the obligation under which he has laid us by his diligent
attendance at the meetings, by his unstinted giving of time and
of labor in editing the publications and maintaining their high
scientific character, by the quality and amount of his own contributions
to the <cite>Journal</cite>&mdash;more than half of volumes VI-XII<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
coming from his pen&mdash;and above all by the inspiration of his
example."</p>

<p>The American Philological Association might have been a
natural off-shoot from the Oriental Society. The latter has had
a 'classical-section' since 1849, of which Professor Hadley was
long at the head, of which Professor Goodwin has been the leader
for nearly a quarter of a century; and classical papers had been
presented by Professor Hadley, as that 'On the theory of Greek
accent,' and by Professor Lane, as that 'On the date of the
Amphitruo of Plautus.' Many of the early members of the
Philological Association were also members of the Oriental
Society. Mr. Whitney presided over the Philological Association
at its first meeting in Poughkeepsie in 1869, and at the
Rochester meeting in 1870, as retiring President, he delivered an
address in which he sketched with great wisdom the Association's
action and work. "The association is to be just what its members
shall make it, and will not bear much managing or mastering. It
must discuss the subjects which are interesting American philologists,
and with such wisdom and knowledge as these have at
command.... In every such free and democratic body things
are brought forward into public which might better have been
kept back.... The classics, of course, will occupy the leading
place; that department will be most strongly represented, and
will least need fostering, while it will call for most careful criticism.
The philology of the American aboriginal languages, on the other
hand, demands, as it has already begun to receive, the most
hearty encouragement.... Educational subjects also are closely
bound up with philology, and will necessarily receive great attention;
yet there should be a limit here; our special task is to
advance the interests of philology only, confident that education
will reap its share of the benefit." Mr. Whitney's services to the
Association, and faithful attendance upon its meetings, may be
estimated from the fact that the first sixteen volumes of the
Transactions contain fourteen papers by him printed in full, while
occasionally he presented communications which he did not care
to print. At its meeting in Williamstown in July last, the Association
adopted the following minute: "The American Philological
Association, at its first meeting after the death of Professor
William D. Whitney, bears grateful testimony to the value of the
services which he rendered for the furtherance of philological
learning, and especially in connection with this Association.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Fitly chosen to be its first President, and retained for a quarter
of a century upon its Executive Committee, he never failed to
take an active part in its work, and in many ways he advanced
its interests and encouraged and assisted the studies to which its
members are devoted. The record of his life-work may be left
for more full recital at another time; but the Association takes
this opportunity of testifying to its sense of obligation to Professor
Whitney's manifold and successful labors, and of the great loss
which his death has brought to its members and to philological
students throughout the world."</p>

<p>Both the classical and the oriental philologists of the country
have noted Mr. Whitney's constancy in attendance on their
gatherings. In November, 1875, he apologized to the Oriental
Society for his absence from the May meeting (caused by his
visit to Europe in the interest of the edition of the Atharva-Veda),
and added that it was his second absence in twenty-one
years from a meeting of the Society! His devoted fidelity to the
little Classical and Philological Society at Yale was just as marked.
A quarter of a century ago, he with Professor Hadley and Professor
Packard made that small gathering a deep source of inspiration.
Many, if not most, of his learned papers were presented
for discussion there. After the death of the lamented Professor
Hadley, which gave a sudden check to the development of Yale's
advanced courses in philology, Mr. Whitney was the mainstay of
the Society, and his regular attendance and patient attention
roused to best effort each who took part. Perhaps I ought to
confess also that some of the younger instructors and graduate
students shrank from presenting papers which might be compared
with the finished scholar's elaborate productions. At these meetings
his patience must have been sorely tried; much that was
presented can have had but little interest for him; but his courtesy
was unfailing. He gave without stint of his precious time to any
undertaking which he believed to be doing, on the whole, useful
philological work.</p>

<p>The first great work of Mr. Whitney's scholarship was the
publication of the Atharva-Veda-Sanhitā, undertaken in 1852
with Professor Roth. The first volume of 458 pages, royal
octavo, was published in 1855-56. In connection with this, he
prepared and published in Weber's <cite>Indische Studien</cite> (vol. IV,
pp. 9-64) in 1857 an 'Alphabetisches Verzeichniss der Versanfänge
der Atharva-Samhitā'; in the <cite>Journal</cite> of the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Oriental Society in 1862 (vol. VII, pp. 333-616) the 'Atharva-Veda-Prātiçākhya,'
with text, translation and notes; in the same
<cite>Journal</cite> in 1881 (vol. XII, pp. 1-383) an 'Index Verborum' to
the published text of the Atharva-Veda. He made to the A.O.S.
in April, 1892, an 'Announcement' as to a second volume of the
Roth-Whitney edition of the Atharva-Veda. "The bulk of the
work" of preparing notes, indexes, etc., "was to have fallen to
Professor Roth, not only because the bulk of the work on the
first volume had fallen to me [i. e. Professor Whitney], but also
because his superior learning and ability pointed him out as the
one to undertake it." But Roth's "absorption in the great labor
of the Petersburg lexicon for a long series of years had kept his
hands from the Atharva-Veda." Mr. Whitney said that he had
never lost from view the completion of the plan of publication as
originally formed. "In 1875 I spent the summer in Germany
chiefly engaged in further collating at Munich and at Tübingen
the additional manuscript material which had come to Europe
since our text was printed; and I should probably have soon
taken up the work seriously, save for having been engaged while
in Germany to prepare a Sanskrit grammar, which fully occupied
the leisure of several following years. At last in 1885-86, I had
fairly started upon the execution of the plan when failure of
health reduced my working capacity to a minimum, and rendered
ultimate success very questionable. The task, however, has never
been laid wholly aside, and it is now so far advanced that barring
further loss of power, I may hope to finish it in a couple of years
or so. The plan includes critical readings upon the text"; the
readings of the Pāippalāda version; the data of the Anukramaṇī
respecting authorship, divinity, and meter of each verse; references
to the ancillary literature; extracts from the printed commentary;
and, finally, a simple literal translation. "An introduction
and indexes will give such further material as appears to be
called for." Of this work the last revision is only partially made;
a few months' more labor would have completed it; Professor
Lanman, of Harvard, has undertaken to finish the revision and
to conduct the volume through the press. Thus Professor
Whitney's work closes as it began&mdash;with the Atharva-Veda.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Whitney's most important service to Sanskrit
philology was the preparation of his 'Sanskrit Grammar, including
both the classical language, and the older dialects, of Veda
and Brahmana,' 486 pp., octavo. This was published in Leipzig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in 1879, in the same year with a German translation. He undertook
this work in 1875, and in 1878 went to Germany with his
family and spent fifteen months in writing out the grammar and
preparing it for the press. He aimed "to make a presentation of
the facts of the language primarily as they show themselves in
use in the literature, and only secondarily as they are laid down
by the native grammarians"; "to include also in the presentation
the forms and constructions of the older language, as exhibited in
the Veda and Brāhmaṇa"; "to treat the language throughout as
an accented one"; "to cast all statements, classifications, and so
on, into a form consistent with the teachings of linguistic science."
"While the treatment of the facts of the language has thus been
made a historical one, within the limits of the language itself, I
have not ventured to make it comparative, by bringing in the
analogous forms and processes of other related languages. To
do this, in addition to all that was attempted beside, would have
extended the work both in content and in time of preparation, far
beyond the limits assigned to it." A second edition, revised and
extended, was published ten years later, in 1889. A 'Supplement
to his Sanskrit Grammar: The Roots, Verb-forms, and Primary
Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language,' 250 pp., was published in
Leipzig in 1885. That he did not discredit and slight the old
Hindu grammarians because of any lack of acquaintance with
them is shown by his own work and publications in that field.
He published not only the Atharva-Veda-Prātiçākhya (text,
translation and notes, in 1862), but also a similar edition of the
Tāittirīya-Prātiçākhya, with its commentary, the Tribhāshyaratna,
in 1871. The true relations of Hindu Grammar to the study of
Sanskrit, he made clear in two articles published in the <cite class="smcap">American
Journal of Philology</cite>, in vols. V and XIV. His last word on
the subject was this: "I would by no means say anything to
discourage the study of Pāṇini; it is highly important and
extremely interesting and might well absorb more of the labor
of the present generation of scholars than is given to it. But I
would have it followed in a different spirit and a different method.
It should be completely abandoned as the means by which we
are to learn Sanskrit. For what the literature contains, the literature
itself suffices; we can understand it and present it vastly
better than Pāṇini could. It is the residuum of peculiar material
involved in his grammar that we shall value, and the attempt
must be made to separate that from the rest of the mass." More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
than twenty-five years ago he called attention to the fact that the
very title of Professor Goldstücker's paper 'On the Veda of the
Hindus and the Veda of the "German School"' involved an
evident <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">petitio principii</i>. The fair theme would have been 'The
Veda of the Hindu Schools, and the Veda of the European
School: which is the true Veda?'</p>

<p>The following extracts from a review by Hillebrandt in the fifth
volume of <cite>Bezzenberger's Beiträge</cite> illustrate the reception generally
accorded to the Sanskrit Grammar:&mdash;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Es handelte sich
für ihn nicht um ein tieferes studium der einheimischen indischen
grammatik, auf deren reiche beobachtungen unsere bisherigen
sanskritgrammatiken fast ausschliesslich sich stützen, sondern
um die erforschung des sprachzustandes, wie ihn die litteratur
selbst aufweist.... Whitney's eigentliche aufgabe war es, in die
sanskritgrammatik die grundsätze der linguistik durchgreifender,
als bisher geschehen war, einzuführen und die sprache als eine
historisch gewordene zu betrachten. Dies princip hatte eine
beständige rücksichtsnahme auf den vedadialekt zur voraussetzung
und verlieh Whitney's buche vorzüge, welche allein genügen
würden, ihm eine hervorragende stellung unter den vorhandenen
lehrbüchern anzuweisen. Die reiche fülle neuen materials,
welches er ... aus allen teilen der vedischen litteratur herbeizog
und in instructiver weise dazu verwandte, über das allmähliche
aufleben und absterben dieses oder jenes sprachgebrauchs aufschluss
zu geben, die durch reiche beispiele und aufstellung ganzer
paradigmen illustrirte unterscheidung vedischer und klassischer
flexion, die von der indischen grammatik vernachlässigte statistische
beobachtung des formenschatzes in älterer und jüngerer
litteratur&mdash;dies sind eigenschaften die es in dieser ausdehnung
mit keinem teilt."</span></p>

<p>The Grammar provided an instrument which all Sanskrit
scholars are now thankfully using.</p>

<p>Of the Supplement to the Grammar, von Bradke wrote in the
third volume of the Literaturblatt für orientalische Philologie:
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"So anspruchslos das Werk auftritt, in dieser Weise konnte es
nur von einem unserer ersten Kenner der altindischen Literatursprache,
und auch von einem solchen nicht ohne lange und
mühevolle Arbeit geschaffen werden."</span></p>

<p>In this connection we should be again reminded that Professor
Whitney was one of the chief four collaborators who furnished
material for the great Sanskrit dictionary published at the expense
of the Russian government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>In March, 1864, Mr. Whitney delivered at the Smithsonian
Institution a series of six lectures on the Principles of Linguistic
Science&mdash;probably lectures which he had given to the Sheffield
Scientific School the preceding year. This course was repeated
before the Lowell Institute and published in 1867, under the title
of 'Language and the Study of Language,' 489 pages. This
was translated into German by Jolly and into Netherlandish by
Vinckers. The clearness and conciseness of the statements and
the soundness of the views, in a field where the wildest vagaries
had prevailed, and where the imagination was still allowed rather
free play, were recognized on every hand. From the time of the
preparation of those lectures, Mr. Whitney seems to have devoted
to this subject more attention than he had given before. In 1875
he published in the International Scientific Series a similar book,
in somewhat more compendious form, on the 'Life and Growth
of Language: an outline of linguistic science,' 326 pages. This
was translated into German, French, Italian, Netherlandish, and
Swedish. This last book grew out of his lectures to academic
senior classes.</p>

<p>No one has done so much as Mr. Whitney to teach sound
views of linguistic science. Although the writer of this sketch
has not ventured to include a detailed discussion of his views,
perhaps mention may be made fitly of two points in which he
was in advance of his contemporaries: he was among the very
first to call attention to <em>analogy</em> as a force in the growth of
language, and the first (after Latham in 1851) to doubt the then
generally accepted view that Asia was the original home of the
Indo-Europeans.</p>

<p>Papers which had been printed in the <cite>North American Review</cite>
and other periodicals were collected and, with more or less revision,
published in two volumes entitled 'Oriental and Linguistic
Studies,' 1873-74, pp. 417 and 432. The first volume contained
papers on the Veda, the Avesta, the science of language; the
second, on the British in India, China and the Chinese, religion
and mythology, orthography and phonology, Hindu astronomy.
The author's regard for his earliest teacher in Sanskrit is marked
by his dedication of the first of the two volumes to "Professor
Edward Elbridge Salisbury, the pioneer and patron of Sanskrit
studies in America." The second volume "is affectionately
dedicated" to "Professors Rudolf Roth and Albrecht Weber,
my early teachers and lifelong friends."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>His long experience as a teacher of modern languages and as
a student of linguistics aided to fit him pre-eminently for the
preparation of grammars, readers, and vocabularies of French
and German for schools and colleges, and his systematic habits
of work enabled him to prepare these easily. This apparatus
met the needs of the newly awakened interest in modern languages
in this country, and has done much to further this interest.
These books are said to be used more widely than any others of
their kind in America. Some of them are published in two
editions, full and abridged. His desire for a reasonable and truly
philological study of the English language led him to prepare for
use in schools 'Essentials of English Grammar' (1877, 260 pages),
which has been adopted extensively by the public schools of the
country and is declared, by one who knows, to have had great
influence on the study of this subject.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney had assisted in the preparation of the
Webster's dictionary of 1864, rewriting the definitions of many
of the important words. This experience, his keen sense of
proportion, his practical turn of mind, his precise and concise
manner of statement, his wide and varied attainments,&mdash;all made
him a peculiarly suitable person to be the editor-in-chief of the
great Century Dictionary with which the people of this country
will long associate his name. His unfortunate illness prevented
him from revising the work so carefully as he doubtless would
have done, had he been in vigorous health, and some have
thought that he should be called supervising-editor rather than
editor-in-chief. As the dictionary stands, he cannot be held
responsible for details; but his influence upon the work was
strong as well as salutary. Though he might not mark the proof
for a dozen pages, he would score the next page in a manner
which set a standard, and showed what he desired the revision of
the rest to be, while the whole body of editors followed the
general lines which he had drawn.</p>

<p>In the list of his writings which was drawn up by Professor
Whitney in 1892, one hundred and forty-four items are enumerated;
but numerous minor articles and book notices are not
included, nor his contributions to the great Sanskrit, Webster,
and Century dictionaries, nor his oversight of the German dictionary
which goes by his name. He wrote articles for the New
American Cyclopedia, Johnson's Cyclopedia, and the Encyclopaedia
Britannica. He was a frequent contributor to the <cite>Nation</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and other periodicals. In view of the importance and extent of
many of his publications, his diligence and intellectual fertility
are extraordinary.</p>

<p>As a teacher of advanced students, Mr. Whitney was exacting.
A two-hour course under him in Sanskrit called for a larger
outlay of time and effort than a four-hour course under most
other teachers. He required precise knowledge of others as well
as of himself. He was never deceived by glittering generalities,
nor satisfied with approximate accuracy when absolute accuracy
was attainable. He was modest, however, and while he would
not allow the violation of well-established principles, yet in the
translation of difficult and uncertain passages he never insisted
on the pupil's adoption of his view.</p>

<p>In controversy and criticism, Mr. Whitney struck hard; his
sword was piercing, even to the sundering of joint and marrow.
But he was fair; he never misrepresented his opponent. He
never lost his temper and struck blindly. He saw so clearly the
absurdities and difficulties of a false position that he felt bound to
present it as it was, yet without any thought of giving personal
offence. For example, no one would suppose that he expected to
offend his friend and teacher, Weber, by the remark that the latter
had "unwittingly put himself in the position of one attempting to
prove on philological grounds that the precessional movement
of the equinoxes is from west to east, instead of from east to
west" (Oct. 1865); but the criticism is very similar to that (which
was counted severe) on Müller (July, 1876), that "even the aid
of Main and Hinds could not keep him, in his astronomical
reasonings, from assuming that, to any given observer, the
ecliptic is identical with his own horizon."</p>

<p>The only prolonged controversy in which Professor Whitney
was ever engaged was that with Professor Max Müller. His
early relations with Müller had been pleasant, and he had supported
the latter's candidacy for his chair at Oxford in 1860.
His first public mention (1867) of Müller's work on the translation
of the Vedas was very complimentary; but when the first
volume of the translation appeared, his review of it was exceedingly
severe. In the fourteenth volume of his <cite>Indische Studien</cite>,
under the heading 'Zur Klarstellung,' Weber gives an account of
the conflict. According to him, the real source of the controversy
was Mr. Whitney's spirited reply to Müller's criticisms on
the Böhtlingk-Roth Dictionary. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Whitney hatte zwei Vorlesungen</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Müller's kritisch besprochen,&mdash;scharf, wie es Whitney's
Art ist, aber ohne irgend welche persönliche Wendung, so wie
sich Gelehrte, denen es um ihre Meinung Ernst ist, zu streiten
pflegen."</span> The occasion of the contest was the publication by
Professor George Darwin, in the <cite>Contemporary Review</cite> of November,
1874, of a report of Mr. Whitney's views. "Müller nahm
sich denn auch gar nicht die Zeit Whitney's Abhandlung selbst
zu lesen, sondern trat gleich in dem folgenden Januar-Heft der
Review mit einer nur auf die Auszüge Mr. Darwin's basirten
Gegenschrift hervor." Some have wondered that Mr. Whitney
should care to follow up the matter so long, and even in 1892
should publish a brochure of 79 pages on 'Max Müller and the
Science of Language: a Criticism.' But the question with him
rose far above personalities: the truth was at stake. His mind,
accurate by both nature and training, shrank from allowing inaccurate
statements and false principles to be floated by a charming
style. Great Britain in this generation has had more than one
scholar of note whose brilliant form of statement, ingenious
theories, and varied attainments have sufficed to give them undue
authority on subjects where they made some grievous errors. Mr.
Whitney felt that the higher a scholar's position, the greater his
authority, the more careful he should be in all matters. He was
heartily vexed by attempts to overlook and avoid the real point
at issue. His vigorous spirit may have felt a certain enjoyment
in a conflict; as an intellectual athlete he could appreciate the
beauty of a keen thrust or the weight of a heavy blow; but while
he did not fear a conflict, in some cases he avoided a controversy,
even when he had been misunderstood and misrepresented.</p>

<p>No sketch of Mr. Whitney's character would be complete which
did not mention his musical tastes. Music was always a source
of pleasure and recreation to him. He had a fine tenor voice;
and when a young man he was an acceptable and admired leader
of the choir of Jonathan Edwards's old church in Northampton.
The story is told that his conversations with the Rev. Dr.
George E. Day, which led to his study of Sanskrit, were more
frequent and natural because of his weekly calls at the pastor's
house for the list of hymns to be sung. He was an active
member of the Mendelssohn Society of New Haven a score of
years ago, and did much to rouse the community to take interest
in oratorios and other choral music, writing for the newspapers
appreciative accounts of the works to be performed. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
prominent in securing for New Haven concerts by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra. One of the last occasions which brought
him into a public gathering was a University Chamber Concert
by the Kneisel Quartet. He was fond of singing hymns on
Sunday evenings, and while he cherished some of the old tunes
of his youth, he welcomed the introduction of the modern more
ecclesiastical music. While singing the old hymns he was as
fervent and orthodox as his Puritan ancestors.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney was no recluse, nor a typical professor in manner.
He attracted men to him and enjoyed being with them. He was
not at all emotional, however, and cared little for general society.
He gave a rather extreme view of himself in a letter written in
1869: "I am of a more than usually reserved and unsocial nature.
I avoid society as much as I can, and am never quite comfortable
in the company of any excepting those with whom I am most
nearly bound. My besetting sin is burying myself in my books
and papers, and too much overlooking all that is outside of them,&mdash;partly
from natural tendencies, partly because I feel that in that
way I shall on the whole do most good and give most pleasure
to others." His bearing was perfectly simple and unpretentious&mdash;in
short, that of a gentleman.</p>

<p>Like Aristotle's "magnanimous man," he gave little heed to
praise or blame&mdash;not being elated or cast down by either. He
loved learning for its own sake and not for its reward of fame.
The words which he wrote with regard to his friend Professor
James Hadley are strikingly true of himself: "No one was ever
more free from the desire to shine among his fellows. His was a
modesty entirely unfeigned, and free from every taint of a lower
feeling.... He devoted himself so entirely to truth and virtue and
duty, as he knew them, that there was left no room for any thought
of self. He neither extolled himself nor gave way unduly to others."
"He knew his power, but possessed it in the spirit of moderation
and reserve." He was eminently guileless&mdash;though by no means
a subject for imposition by others. He would have made an
admirable lawyer or statesman, but he could not have been a
politician. He saw truth clearly and abhorred anything like
trickery or disingenuousness. He was also thoroughly sane.
Sentimental enthusiasm never led him to denote as certain views
which later were to be proved false. He had few scientific retractions
to make in the course of forty-five years of publication.
His statements on uncertain points were carefully guarded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Where doubt existed, he was apt to feel it; in fact he was called
in Germany "der Skeptiker der Sprachwissenschaft." His sanity
restrained him from various excesses. His opinions on the desirability
of reform in the spelling of the English language were
clear and clearly expressed, and he was the first chairman of the
committee appointed by the Philological Association for the
furtherance of this reform in our country, but he saw so distinctly
the difficulties in the way of an abrupt change, at least for the
present, that he wasted no time in a Quixotic crusade. He was
invited by the Japanese government to prepare an opinion in
regard to the adoption of English as the official language of
Japan&mdash;but he was not carried away by any sentimental notions
of English as a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weltsprache</i>. His mind was like a diamond, and
his style was eminently clear and forcible. He never strove to be
eloquent, but always expressed his thoughts in the fewest and
simplest words. His was the style of a teacher rather than that
of a popular platform-lecturer, but was enlivened by a strong
sense of humor and by keen wit.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney's services to science and learning were freely
recognized, both at home and abroad. He received the degree
of Ph.D., <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">honoris causa</i>, from the University of Breslau in 1865;
that of LL.&nbsp;D. from Williams College in 1868, from the College
of William and Mary in 1869, from Harvard in 1876, and from
the University of Edinburgh in 1889; that of J.U.D. from St.
Andrews University in Scotland in 1874; that of L.H.D. from
Columbia in 1887. He was a member of the National Academy
of Sciences; an honorary member of the Oriental or Asiatic
societies of Great Britain and Ireland, of Germany, of Bengal,
of Japan, and of Peking; of the Literary Societies of Leyden,
of Upsala, and of Helsingfors; fellow of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh; member or correspondent of the Academies of
Dublin, of Turin, of Rome (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lincei</i>), of St. Petersburg, of Berlin,
and of Denmark; also, correspondent of the Institute of France;
and Foreign Knight of the Prussian order <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour le mérite</i> for
Science and Arts, being elected May 31, 1881, to fill the vacancy
made by the death of Thomas Carlyle.</p>

<p>In 1870 the Berlin Academy of Sciences voted him the first
Bopp prize for his publication of the Tāittirīya-Prātiçākhya, as
the chief contribution to Sanskrit philology during the preceding
three years.</p>

<p>The following extracts from a brief article in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<cite>Berliner Nationalzeitung</cite>, from the pen of Professor Albrecht Weber,
form an interesting companion-piece to the letter from the same
scholar, dated in December, 1852, which was quoted in the early
part of this sketch: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Der jüngst in Yalecollege verstorbene Professor
William Dwight Whitney war einer der ersten Indianisten
und Sprachforscher der Gegenwart. Seine Sanskritstudien absolvirte
er bei uns in Deutschland, hier in Berlin bei Weber und in
Tübingen bei Roth. Beide Gelehrte betrachten es als einen ihrer
schönsten Ehrentitel, ihn zum Schüler gehabt zu haben. Gleich
seine erste Arbeit in den <cite>Indischen Studien</cite> ... war ein Meisterwerk
und zeigte alle die Eigenschaften, die seinen Arbeiten einen
so hohen Werth verleihen sollten, Klarheit, Sorgsamkeit, und
Akribie im kleinsten Detail.... Heimgekehrt nach Amerika,
ward er der Begründer der dortigen, jetzt in reicher Blüthe
stehenden Sanskrit-Philologie, die sich besonders durch die von
ihm speziell betonte <em>statistische</em> Methode grosse Verdienste
erworben hat, u. A. durch seine Schüler: Avery, Bloomfield,
Hopkins, Lanman, Jackson, Oertel, Perry, Smyth, Snyder, trefflich
vertreten wird.... Seine Uebersetzung eines der ältesten
vorhandenen Lehrbücher der indischen Astronomie zeigte ihn als
trefflichen Rechner und Astronom. Schärfe der Kritik, Klarheit
der Darstellung, Genauigkeit der Arbeit sind allen seinen Werken
als Stempel aufgedrückt. Sein reifstes Werk wohl ist seine
'Sanskrit-Grammatik,' ... die erste <em>historische</em> Darstellung derselben,
gewissermassen ein <em>gründliches</em> Résumé aus dem grossen
Petersburger Sanskrit-Wörterbuch von Böhtlingk und Roth.
Seine Arbeiten erstreckten sich im Uebrigen auf die verschiedensten
Gebiete der Sprachwissenschaft.... Deutschland verliert
in ihm einen der wärmsten Freunde, die es in Amerika hatte,
Amerika einen seiner besten Gelehrten, und die Wissenschaft im
grossen und ganzen einen ihrer ersten Koryphäen."</span></p>

<p>On August 28, 1856, Professor Whitney married Elizabeth
Wooster Baldwin, daughter of the Hon. Roger Sherman Baldwin,
of New Haven (ex-Governor of Connecticut and U.&nbsp;S. Senator),
great-granddaughter of Roger Sherman, and great-great-granddaughter
of President Thomas Clap, of Yale. Six children, three
sons and three daughters, were born to them; of whom one son
(the Hon. Edward B. Whitney, Assistant Attorney-General of
the U.&nbsp;S.) and the three daughters survive. The daughters
assisted their father in some of his later publications in the field
of modern languages, and have done literary work of their own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Just after a hard summer's work, at the very beginning of the
college year in the autumn of 1886, Professor Whitney was prostrated
by a severe disorder of the heart. For a time he was
forbidden by his physician to do more than a minimum of work.
He was obliged to avoid fatigue and excitement, and was limited
strictly in his physical exercise. Those who had seen him return
invigorated and exhilarated from a ten-miles' walk in the country
were deeply pained to watch his slow, measured gait. He surprised
many by his graceful submission to restrictions which he
must have felt most keenly, and his household was still the
brightest and most cheerful in the city. The gentler side of his
nature became more prominent than before. His face grew more
and more beautiful, with his white hair and beard, and delicate
fair complexion. Though not an old man, he became truly
venerable in appearance, and his presence was a real benediction
to all whom he met. He was obliged to abandon entirely his
work with undergraduate classes, but continued his classes in
Sanskrit, receiving the students in his study at his home. During
most of the past year he had six of these exercises each week.
He did not abandon his other scholarly work. During the early
years of this period of weakness, the Century Dictionary was
going through the press and received his care. Every year
witnessed his publication of some scientific paper or papers. He
aided in the plans for the World's Congress of Philology, last
year. One of his intimate associates, Professor Lounsbury, has
written of him: "To me, at least, words seem inadequate to
describe the quiet heroism which gave serenity and calm to his
latter days, and the unflinching resolution with which he met and
discharged every duty of a life over which the possibility of
sudden death was always casting its shadow."</p>

<p>After an illness of about two weeks, Mr. Whitney passed away
from this life, during sleep, on the morning of Thursday, June 7,
1894.</p>

<p>In the death of William Dwight Whitney, this country has lost
one of her most distinguished men, one who had been recognized
throughout the world as one of the highest authorities in his
department of learning, and who had been for forty years the
leader of oriental and linguistic studies in America and the
personal master of a majority of the American scholars in his
department. Yale University has lost one of her most brilliant
and able scholars, one of her wisest and most faithful teachers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
whose influence always made for diligent and honest research
and statement. His publications have had a lasting effect on
scholarship. His personal influence will long endure. In the
words of Professor Lanman, "for power of intellect, conjoined
with purity of soul and absolute genuineness of character, we
shall not soon look upon his like again."</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
