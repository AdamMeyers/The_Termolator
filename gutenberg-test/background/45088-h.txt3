PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Volume 108, February 9, 1895.

edited by Sir Francis Burnand



TO LUCENDA.

(Who had made "Copy" of Me.)



The bright September when we met
My prospects were not over healthy,
Though you were, I do not forget,
Extremely wealthy.


I know not why it chanced to be,
But this I recollect most clearly&mdash;
It never once occurred to me
To love you dearly.


'Twas not your fault, so do not vex
Yourself, for I admired your beauty,
Since admiration of your sex
Is Man's Whole Duty.


And thus it came to be our lot
To part without a sign or token;
I went upon my way, but not
The least heart-broken.


My "fatal pride" does not object
At your fair hands to be made verse on;
But p'raps next time you will select&mdash;
Some other person!




Unanswerable.&mdash;The Archbishop of
Canterbury, speaking at Folkestone last
week, said that "The Disestablishment Bill does not need any
answering: it answers itself." An' it please your Grace, if it does
"answer," and answers its purpose, what more can be required of this
Bill or any other?



The New Weather Proverb.&mdash;It never
rains&mdash;but it snows!




  BRAVE GIRL!
  Millicent (from the country).
  "Now, Mabel! let's make a Dash!!"




QUEER QUERIES.

Freezing the Vertebr√¶.&mdash;I am in the last
stage of bronchitis, complicated with pneumonia, influenza, and
asthma, and a friend has advised me to try the new French cure of
applying ice to the spine. Will some obliging physician tell me
whether he considers such a course safe? None but a recognised
specialist need trouble to reply; and if he does so, I shall have the
satisfaction of feeling that I have saved his fee, as well as my own
life. My boy advises me to go skating, and "I shall be sure then to
have my back applied to the ice," which he says is the same thing as
applying ice to my back. But is it? A nephew who is staying in the
house also kindly offers to "shy hard snow-balls at my spine," if that
would help me in any way. It is a pity that the newspaper (from which
I derived this medical hint) was not clear as to details; for
instance, when I have applied the ice, what is to prevent its
melting and trickling all over me?

&mdash;Non-paying Patient.



Meteorological Moralising.


'Tis an ill-wind which blows nobody good,
And one man's meat another's poison is.
What is disaster to one man or mood,
Is to another mood or man "good biz."
What to your dramatist means love's labour's lost,
Your would-be skater craves&mdash;"a perfect frost!"




OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

By the publication of The Play Actress
(S. R. Crockett) Mr.
Fisher Unwin fully maintains the success
attained by his Autonym Library. My Baronite is least attracted by the
scenes which possibly pleased the author most&mdash;those in which he
describes life in the purlieus of London theatres. Mr.
Crockett is much more at home in Galloway,
and with the people who sparsely populate it. The opening chapter,
describing Sabbath day in the Kirk of the Hill is in his best style,
as are others describing the Great Preacher's tender caring for his
little grand-daughter. The Play Actress is just the sort of
thing to buy at a bookstall on starting for a journey. It will be felt
to be a matter of regret if the journey isn't quite long enough to
finish it at a sitting.

In The Worst Woman in London ("and other stories," a
subtitle craftily suppressed on the outside of the book by
F. C. Philips) the author gives us a number
of capital detached stories of a most irritating abruptness. Almost
every one of these stories is a novel thrown away; that is, every
story is in itself the germ of what might have been a good novel. They
are little more than "jottings for plottings." Yet, to be read with a
pipe or small cigar, they just suffice to wile away time and obviate
conversation. They are dedicated to Mr. Walter
Herries Pollock, who has on more than one occasion shown
himself an adept at real good short stories&mdash;not merely as plots, but
genuinely complete in themselves and full of humour&mdash;and from whom the
Baron expects something more in the same line, or, rather, on the same
lines.

The Baron de B.-W.



A MODERN ECLOGUE.

Scene&mdash;A Crowded
Thoroughfare. Enter Strephon
and Phyllis on bicycles, at the
rate of fifteen miles an hour.

Strephon.


We care not, Phyllis, my own,
to-day,
For walking in Kensington Park,
To flirt in the old conventional way,
And saunter home in the dark.
Nay, pleasanter far it is to "scorch"&mdash;
To hear your silvery bell,
While the answering squeak of my horn may speak
For the fact that I love you well!


Both.


Oh, isn't it sweet to clear the street,
While elderly persons frown!
"Now, stoopid, look out!" we pleasantly shout,
And bang goes a gentleman down!


Phyllis.


Strephon, I love you, I confess,
For who could fail to admire
The humorous way you spoil a dress
And ruin a girl's attire?
To see you silently creep along,
And then with a burst of speed
Spread liberal dirt on the feminine skirt
Is a sight for the gods, indeed!


Both.


Oh, isn't it glee to do it, and see
The lady-pedestrian flinch,
With jubilant rush to scatter the slush
And miss her foot by an inch!


Strephon.


I frightened those horses, I'm much afraid,&mdash;
The excellent coachman's riled!


Phyllis.


And I've demolished a nursery-maid,
And certainly hurt a child!


Strephon.


I made that stately dowager jump,
She leapt to one side, and puffed!


Phyllis.


That leisurely cur, I'm inclined to infer,
To-morrow will go to be stuffed!


Both.


So side by side we merrily ride,
And scatter the murmuring throng,
Who think the police should compel us to cease,
And mournfully ask, "How long?"




Just a little too much.&mdash;When a
parliamentary candidate or popular Member is received with a
torchlight procession, it is almost unnecessary for his constituents
to present him, on a dark night, with "an illuminated address."



[pg 62]


  "VOICI LE SABRE DE MON P√àRE!"
  "I intend to protect the principle of autocracy as firmly and
  unswervingly as did my late and never-to-be-forgotten
  father."&mdash;Czar's Speech, Jan. 29.


[pg 63]



THE FRENCH AMNESTY.

Bruxelles, le 31. Janvier.

Monsieur,&mdash;I write to you, M.
Punch, these some words, which I essay to write in english. I come
of to receive&mdash;how say you la nouvelle?&mdash;the new of the amnesty
in France. The government which banished the descendant of the great
Napol√©on has recalled some exileds. But he
has not recalled me, ce gouvernement inf√¢me! He has left to
languish the heir of the crown imperial in this droll of little town.
Nom d'une pipe, quelle ville! Rien qu'un Palais de Justice et
quelques rues d√©sertes! But I go to write in english. I rest here,
at five hours of Paris, alldays ready, alldays vigilant. Mais que
c'est triste! Tiens, it is not perhaps so sad as that&mdash;how
write you the name?&mdash;that Stove, in your d√©partement of the
Bukkinhammshir. At least one speak french in this country. It is not
the french of Paris, or the french of Touraine, but all of same it
values better than english&mdash;a language so difficult. Thus I rest here,
I walk myself to horse in their Wood of Cambre, I visit of time in
time the Palace of Justice and Ste. Gudule, et voil√† c'est
fini! Then I recommence and I see, encore une fois, the
Bois, the Palais, and the Cath√©drale. I go not to
Waterloo, for people say my Great Ancestor there was conquered by your
Duc of Welintong. One has wrong, the
historians have wrong, mais enfin, que faire? I may not to
write the history of new. A l'avenir nous verrons. En attendant
j'attends. And I stand, like my Great Ancestor, the arms folded,
and frown towards the frontier of the France, la patrie
ingrate. It is a fine attitude, and I study it all the days.

Agr√©ez, &amp;c.      N.

Stowe, the 31. January.

Sir,&mdash;I tell you my thoughts as calmly as possibly, but my heart
burns! Heaven, what injustice! To France&mdash;ah, I say not her name
without emotion!&mdash;to France I offered my sword, my service, my life!
She refused them! Ingrateful country! Me who&mdash;but I go to be calm!
When Casimir-P√©rier resigns I voyage
without to lose an instant to Dover, I wait, I receive each instant
some despatch, I regard the coast of France and weep, I am
photographed! Me, the descendant of St.
Louis, I am photographed! But in vain! I
desire even to die for France, but I may not! By blue, what
ingratitude! And now she proclaims the amnesty and I am forgotten! Me,
the descendant of St. Louis! Me who desire
the struggle, the efforts of a life of soldier, of a life of king, me
I rest here in simple renter of province! Me who wish to die for
France, I am obliged to live in England! To live, just heaven! And in
England, which I despise, though she shelters me! Perhaps she is not
worse than Belgium, Buckingham or Bruxelles! It is equal to me! Nor
the one nor the other is France! Again I weep! Ah, if I could shed
tears of blood! I can not! Heaven, that I should not have even that
consolation there! And Rochefort returns!
He may die for his country, for France! Once more I weep bitterly! But
me I may not! I conclude, and my last word shall be a word of order!
It shall be, though she spurns me, though she mock herself of me,
"Live France!" Again I weep! Receive, &amp;c. P.




  SUCCESSFUL SANITATION.
  Anxious Tourist. "Since your Town has
  been newly drained, I suppose there is less Fever here?"

  Hotel-Keeper (reassuringly).
  "Ach, yes, Sir! Ze Teefoose (Typhus) is now
  quite ze exception!"




"VOICI LE SABRE DE MON P√àRE!"


["Let all know that, in devoting all my strength to the welfare of
the people, I intend to protect the principle of autocracy as firmly
and unswervingly as did my late and never-to-be-forgotten father."

The Czar to the assembled Deputies and Delegates
in the Winter Palace.]



"It was my father's custom, and so it shall be mine!"&mdash;
One seems to hear those simple words 'midst all the show and
shine
Of the great, gay, white-pillared hall. The gold and silver
chains
Of deputies and delegates from distant steppes and plains
Gleam in the winter daylight. The tall white-tunic'd Guards
Stand with drawn swords, Autocracy's serene and stalwart wards.
All in the Winter Palace; from regions vast and far
They come of many a race and creed to welcome their young Czar.
The nobles and the Zemstros, too, are represented here.
With tribes of the wild Caucasus, the hosts who love&mdash;and
fear&mdash;
The monarch of one hundred and twenty million souls.
And through thine Hall, St. Nicholas, in full firm accents
rolls
The Voice of armed Autocracy, unbending and unchanged.
Unfaltering the youthful eye that boldly roved and ranged
Over that motley muster. He lifts his sire's great sword,
This youthful heir to power supreme, by freemen much abhorred,
But dear to bowing myriads of Slavdom's loyal hosts;
And with that calm cold dignity which despotism boasts
Establishes the Ego of Autocracy once more.
Voici le sabre de mon sire! What
Alexander bore
Shall Nicholas not wear and wield? The
appanage of our line!
"It was my father's custom, and so it shall be mine!"
Old rustic song, your refrain long shall echo round our world,
Until all burdens from the back of toiling men are hurled.
Far, far off day! Now proud and gay Autocracy's strong thralls
Muster to-day in fine array in those white-pillared halls.
To be&mdash;not snubbed, say reassured, that Autocrats, still
strong,
Still give small heed to serfs who plead, to freedom's siren
song,
Or to "absurd illusions," which, slipped from mouth to mouth,
Must still be silenced in the North, if heeded in the South.
Those Zemstros voices must be hushed. Autocracy's sole hand
Must wield the sabre of his sire, and sway a silent land;
The Bear from the new Bearward gentler treatment well may hope,
But hardly loosening of the chain or slackening of the rope.
The patient Northern Bruin stands and rubs a dubious ear.
Amnesty means not Liberty. Autocracy is clear
In "firmly and unswervingly," with strength that doth not tire,
Holding the mastery of its race, the Sabre of its Sire!




"Mr. Pepys's Parish Church."&mdash;The Rev.
Alfred Povah's interesting work gives us
the origin of the "Navy pew" in St. Olave's. In such a church how
appropriate was the old "three-decker," as this structure, which
contained clerk below, parson in the middle, and preacher in the
topmost compartment, used to be termed.



A Just Correction.&mdash;In
Macmillan's for this month there is an interesting article
entitled "In the Wake of Captain Cook." An Irish member of the
club threw the number down, exclaiming, "The man who wrote that can't
write English! 'Tis not 'in the wake' at all. Sure it ought to
be 'at the wake.'"



Legal Clockwork.&mdash;Towards the end of
last week, the key of the difficulty having been found, the
Justice-Vaughan-Williams'-winding-up
business was wound up, and J. V. W., being wound up, was set going
again. There is, however, still some difficulty, and a little oil on
the troubled works will be necessary. Mem. to the Lord
Chancellor.&mdash;"Please not to touch the figures."




Q. What is the best sort of cigar to smoke in a Hansom?
A. A Cab-ana.

[pg 64]



LITTLE MOPS√ãMAN.

THE SECOND ACT.


A little narrow glen, with a slope in the background, belonging
to Alfred. Under the dripping trees
a table and chairs, all made of thin birchstaves. Everything is sodden
with wet, and mist-wreaths are driving about.
Alfred Fr√ºyseck, dressed in a black
mackintosh, sits dejectedly on a chair. Presently
Mopsa Brovik comes down the slope
cautiously behind, and touches his shoulder;
Alfred jumps.


Mopsa. You shouldn't really sit about on damp seats in such
miserable weather, Alfred. I have been
hunting for you everywhere.

[Closing her umbrella with quiet
significance.

Alfred (to himself). Run to earth! Oh, Lor'!
(Aloud.) If you would only be kind enough to search for
Mops√´man instead! I cannot unravel
the mystery of his disappearance. There he was, just entering upon
conscious intelligence&mdash;full of the infinite possibilities of
performing poodlehood. I had charged myself with his education. After
having been an usher at so many boarding-schools, I felt peculiarly
fitted for such a task. And then a shady scoundrel has only to come
his way with rats in a bag&mdash;&mdash;!

Mopsa. But we don't in the least know how it really all came
about.

Alfred. That infernal
Varmint-Bl√∂k is at the bottom of it, you
may depend upon that! Though what motive in the world&mdash;&mdash;
(Quivering.) It's not as if Mops√´man
would ever have faced a rat. He used to bolt at the mere sight of a
blackbeetle even. The whole thing is so utterly meaningless,
Mopsa. And yet, I suppose the order of the
universe requires it.

Mopsa. Have you indulged in these abstruse philosophical
speculations with Spreta?

Alfred (shakes his head hopelessly). She is so
utterly incapable of&mdash;&mdash; (Mopsa
nods.) I prefer discussing them with you. There is
something unnatural in imparting confidences to a mere wife. What on
earth have you got there?

Mopsa (takes a little housewife out of her pocket).
Spreta said you had lost the button off the
back of your collar. I thought I would sew it on for you. May
I? (With quiet warmth.) I'll try not to run the needle
into you.

Alfred (absently). Do; it may distract my thoughts a
little. Where is Spreta, by the
way?

Mopsa. Only taking a little walk with
Blochdr√§hn. (Sewing.) Perhaps it is
hardly the weather for a stroll; but then he was always so
perfectly devoted to&mdash;h'm&mdash;to Little
Mops√´man, you know.

Alfred (surprised). But
Spreta wasn't. She never liked him&mdash;not
even as a puppy. And now tell me&mdash;don't you think you could take a
fancy to Blochdr√§hn&mdash;h'm?

Mopsa. Oh, no! Please! (Covers her face with her
hands.) You mustn't really ask me why. (Looks at him through
her fingers.) Because I know I should tell you; you have
such an irresistible influence over me. Oh dear! oh dear! what
will you think of me? (Moves close up to him.) There's a
button off your shirt-front now!

Alfred (plaintively). Am I to have that one
sewn on too?

Mopsa. Yes, it's the right thing to do. Though how
Spreta can let you go about like
this, I can't think!

Alfred (with a half smile). When I have you to
look after me. This is quite like the dear old days!

Mopsa. Yes. (Sewing.) I remember I mended all your
things, like a sister. Even then you never had quite all your
buttons, had you, dear?

Alfred (patting her hand). Not even then. And do you
remember how you used to follow me about, just like a little dog? And
I used to call you "Little Mops√´man,"
because your name was Mopsa; and if I had
had a dog, I should have called him Little
Mops√´man. And then how you used to sit up
and hold a biscuit on your nose, my dear faithful
Mopsa!

Mopsa. I wonder how you can be so childish! (Smiling
involuntarily.) It was a rich beautiful time; but it was
all over when you married. I hope you have never mentioned all that
nonsense to Spreta?

Alfred. I may have. One does tell one's wife
some things&mdash;unintentionally. (Clutching his forehead.) But oh,
how can I sit here and forget Little
Mops√´man so completely? Have I no
heart?

Mopsa. If you have lost it, I think I know where it is. And
you must surely give your grief a rest occasionally, too.

Alfred. I mustn't. I won't. I will think of him....
By the way, are we to have dried fish for dinner again?... Oh,
there I go once more&mdash;in the very middle of my agony&mdash;just when
I want to be torturing myself unspeakably with this gnawing crushing
regret! What a wonderfully realistic touch it is, though, eh? So
dramatic! But after all, I have you,
Mopsa. I'm so glad of that!

Mopsa (looking earnestly at him). Surely you mean
dear Spreta&mdash;not me,
Alfred?

Alfred. What relation is a wife to her husband? None
whatever. Now you, Mopsa, you are
very nearly a second cousin once removed, not quite&mdash;because our
family is a thing so entirely apart. We have always had vowels (the
very best vowels) for our initials, and the same coloured
spectacles, and poor relations we invariably cut, and great thick
works we never get really on with. You take after your mother,
Kaia.

Mopsa. And my Aunt&mdash;she that was a Miss
Rebecca West. I feel so irresistibly drawn
to disturb other people's domestic harmony. But you must really forget
me, and try to care for poor Spreta a
little.

Alfred (vehemently). It's no use. I can't.
You've entranced me so thoroughly. (Helplessly.) I knew
you would! Do let me remain here with you!

[Seizes her hand.

Mopsa (looks warmly at him). Of course, if you really
mean that, I cannot pretend that such comradeship is&mdash;&mdash;Hush!
let go my hand&mdash;there's somebody coming!

[Spreta and
Blochdr√§hn enter in waterproofs, sharing
the same umbrella.

Alfred (annoyed). Why do you come bothering here?
Surely you must see that such an interruption is most
ill-timed.

Spreta (with a cutting laugh). We did gather
that, Alfred. I came to see what you
were about.

Alfred. Mopsa was simply
sympathising with me over Little Mops√´man's
disappearance&mdash;that was all.

Spreta. Sympathising and philandering,
Alfred, are synonymous terms in the
Norwegian Drama. And I may be allowed to observe that other
people can philander if they're driven to it.

[Glances at
Blochdr√§hn.

Mopsa (taking her umbrella quickly, to
Blochdr√§hn). We seem to be somewhat de
trop here. Suppose we withdraw?

[They do.

Spreta. Doesn't it strike you,
Alfred, that all this morbid harping on
that missing mongrel may be just a little monotonous&mdash;for a popular
audience, I mean?

Alfred (gloomily). They'll have to sit through
another Act and a half of it&mdash;that's all. I shall harp if I choose. I
like harping. And you always detested
Mops√´man. You said he ate too much, and had
evil eyes.

Spreta. So he did&mdash;so he had! And you
never really and truly loved him either, or you would never have made
such a fool of the dog as you did!


  "Yes, Alfred, Retribution!"


[pg 65]

Alfred. I had renounced my wonderful thick book. I needed
something to fill up my life!

Spreta. You might have chosen something better than a
miserable little poodle with no hair on his tail!

Alfred (turns pale). It is you&mdash;you, who were
the guilty one in that. (Harshly and coldly.) It was
your hand that spilt the hot water over him as he lay
comfortably on the hearthrug. It was! And you know
it!

Spreta (terrified, yet defiant). Better own at once
that you came behind me and jogged my arm!

Alfred (in suppressed desperation). Yes, that is
true. You looked so entrancingly beautiful as you were putting the
kettle on for tea, that I was irresistibly impelled to kiss you!

Spreta (exasperated).
Alfred! This is intolerable of you.
Do I deserve to be reproached for looking entrancingly
beautiful?

Alfred (with sarcasm). Not in the least&mdash;now.
You are subject to the Law of Change. But what does all that matter?
We have both sinned, if you like. While we had him, we both
shrank in secret from him&mdash;we could not bear to see the tail he
dragged about after him!

Spreta (whispers). You were so perpetually putting
paraffin upon it, Alfred!

Alfred (calmer). Yes, that. I tried to perfect
its possibilities. But it was no use&mdash;I could never, never make it
good again. And after that I dressed him up in military uniform, and
then he had to remain too much indoors, so, of course, he followed the
Varmint-Bl√∂k, and then the street curs
chevied him over the pier. And after I had trained him so thoroughly
to shoulder a musket, he was so totally unable to swim. Oh, it all
works out into quite a logical Retribution. And I must go away into
the solitudes and writhe with remorse&mdash;by myself.

Spreta (bitingly). Unless, of course, you can induce
Mopsa to&mdash;&mdash;I think you mentioned once that
she used to follow you about like a little dog?

Alfred (in a hollow voice). I did. I remember now.
That time when the tea-kettle&mdash;&mdash;Retribution!

[He staggers into the thinnest birchstave chair,
which collapses under him.

Spreta (menacingly standing over him). Yes,
Alfred, Retribution!

[Mopsa and
Blochdr√§hn return.

Mopsa (pleasantly). Well, my dear
Spreta, have you and dear
Alfred talked things thoroughly out?

Spreta. Oh, yes; quite thoroughly enough, I really will
not be left alone with Alfred any
more; he is too depressing!

Alfred (on the ground). One cannot be expected to
rollick when one is being gnawed with remorse! But perhaps
Blochdr√§hn would be a more cheerful
companion for you; go on with him, while
Mopsa helps me up again. We'll follow
you&mdash;presently.

[Spreta and
Blochdr√§hn go off together;
Mopsa tenderly assists
Alfred to rise.

Mopsa. Oh, dear me! it does seem such a pity! But
Spreta always was peculiar. It must
be so trying for you, dear!

Alfred. So much so that I can't stand her any longer. I
must get away, anywhere&mdash;quite alone.
Mopsa, will you come too?

Mopsa (shocked). Alfred!
How can you? What have I said or done to encourage such
a proposal? So utterly unexpected!

Alfred (feebly). I really couldn't help it. It's the
troll inside me. What am I saying? That belongs to another Norwegian
drama!

Mopsa. All this part belongs to several other
Norwegian dramas, dear. But we must see if we can't get out of the old
groove this time!

Alfred. But why in the world&mdash;&mdash;? When you showed such a
wonderful preference for my society, too!

Mopsa (gently). I know, dear. But that was
before&mdash;&mdash;. Let me tell you something. (Slow music;
Alfred sits down, cautiously.) I've
just been looking through my big portfolio, and I've discovered&mdash;what
do you think? (Alfred shakes his
head hopelessly.) I'm not Kaia's
daughter at all, really. I'm only adopted!

Alfred. But what difference does that make in our
relations? Practically, none whatever!

Mopsa. All the difference,
Alfred. I always pursued you about with
reluctance and under protest. Being, as I supposed, descended from
Kaia Fosli, and related to
Rebecca West, it seemed so utterly the
right thing to do. But I know now that I am nothing of the
sort, and that if my real mother ever possessed such a thing as a
Past at all, it was Plu-perfect. So heredity doesn't come in, and,
rather than interfere between you and poor dear
Spreta, I have decided to go right away
and never see you again. I really mean it, this
time!

[She opens her umbrella and runs off up the
slope.

Alfred (takes up his hat sadly). Isn't this play
going to end pessimistically after all, then? (Shudders.) Are
we actually going to be&mdash;moral? (More hopefully.) After all,
there's another Act left. There's a chance still!

[He follows hastily after
Mopsa.

RETRIBUTION.

(Wrought by a cheap Foreign Cigar.)



I'm feeling&mdash;great heavens!&mdash;all sixes and sevens,
And dizzy, and giddy, and green;
Knocked flat as a pancake, I've got a blank, blank ache
All over&mdash;a sight to be seen!


Alas! for the reason 'tis easy to seize on&mdash;
The same I'll proceed to relate:&mdash;
I've just come from Brussels, whence, after some tussles
With conscience, I rushed to my fate.


For by Calais and Dover I safely brought over
A contraband hatful of weeds;
Ah, why did I struggle to juggle and smuggle,
Thus paying the price for my deeds?


They cost each five farthings, and goodness! they are
things
You'd not get your worst foe to smoke,
This "Cabbagio Fino" has giv'n me a beano&mdash;
But there! I'm too seedy to joke!


So this crude composition I pen in contrition,
My state of collapse to explain;
I thought to be clever, but never, oh never,
Will make such a bargain again!




Contradiction.&mdash;A fortnight ago, in the
law reports of the Times, were reported proceedings in
bankruptcy "in re Toby." We have
been requested to state that this gentleman is not Mr. Punch's
"Toby, M.P.," nor is "our Mr.
Toby" the gentleman mentioned in the same
case as "the bankrupt's brother, M. P.
Toby." The coincidence was, naturally, somewhat startling. Our
M.P. for Barks will, by now, have appeared in his place at St.
Stephen's.

finds himself pledged to a very large and extensive programme, to each
point of which programme there is a large circle of adherents who

Westminster Pavement Artist loquitur:&mdash;



Who would be a political "screever"? A drudge
Foredoomed to designing, and destined to smudge,
Like impressionist painters of posters?
Art's in a rum way. Lor! what humbug it is!
Far better the days of old Cruikshank
and Phiz,
Than our era of blobbers and boasters.


With chalks, and my thumb, and a bit of old rag,
I can do better work on a rough slab of flag
Than they do on smooth hot-pressed paper.
But oh! what a bother to squat and to smear
All sorts of strange subjects, quaint, squiffy and queer,
To please every lounger and gaper.


There once was a time when the old repertore
The public would fetch. Now they want a lot more,
And always a somethink that's novel,
And then such a choice of 'em! Not one or two
Seascapes, with a liberal yaller and blue,
Or some picture of cottage or hovel.


Two mackerels crossed, or a slice o' red salmon,
A rasher o' bacon, or lump o' brown "gammon,"
A ginger-beer bottle and candle.
A rat in a trap and a portrait or two,
Say old Garibaldi, the Wandering
Jew,
And p'raps Julius C√¶sar or
Handel.


These gave satisfaction to parties all round;
But 'tisn't so now as I lately have found.
They ask a whole National Gallery.
And every one wants his own fav'rite fust off.
Good old "Moonlight Scene"? Why, a yokel would scoff
At anythink bluey-and-yallery.


They claim fancy-chalks now, or pollychrome pastel;
It's no use to tip 'em a storm or a castle;
They want "local colour"&mdash;a lot of it.
Yes, something distinctly Welsh, Irish, or Scotch;
My pitch in these critical days is no cotch;
I'm sick of the worry and rot of it!


Pity the artist! What boots that appeal?
No! "Many help one," or "A heart that can feel,"
Won't fetch 'em, however well flourished.
I did think that Guy Fawkes blow-up of the Lords
Would call out the coppers; but shrugs and cold words
Have damped the last hope that I nourished.


Awful cynicle lot! Scarcely one a believer
In me, it would seem, since that there Grand Old
Screever
To my hands has turned his pitch over.
There! I've touched up the lightning, and now I am ready!
But, though I must look bright, expectant, and steady,
I don't feel percisely in clover!

THE DECADENT LOVER OF FICTION.



"One love, one life," was my ancient manner,
For introspection I had no brain,
But I would have died beneath her banner,
Or I would have lived, her grace to gain.
I loved her silent, I loved her sprightly,
With Grecian braid or with glossy curl;
I loved her wrongly, I loved her rightly,
But ever I loved a single girl.


But now with ennui my love is laden
Before it really has quite begun;
If I win the heart of any maiden
It makes me prefer another one.
Dim passions stir me, deflections fleeting;
I feel myself in a hopeless whirl.
There never are less than six competing.
Why can I not love a single girl?


Contented I and my love were mated
In those brave days when we both were young.
For marriage I'm now too complicated,
Too many-natured, too finely-strung.
My spreading canvas all zephyrs vary
For one calm funnel how can I furl?
In truth, the statute is somewhat chary.
And old, and grey, grows the dearest girl!


Oh, love that was loyal, losing, winning,
That time and change had no power to quell,
That once could even dispense with sinning,
And that possession could not dispel!
Your day is done, and your star's declining,
The hero was but a brainless churl
Who ever dreamed that without repining
His whole life long he could love one girl!


And yet, I feel there is something wanting.
The knowledge that love is sure to die
To every lover is disenchanting.
I would I loved as in days gone by.
'Twas braver folly the height to capture,
Though down from the height Fate often hurls.
He misses woe, but he misses rapture,
Who falls in love with too many girls!

SITTING OUT.



In throbbing silence my glances stray
O'er her unreciprocal face,
And I haven't a notion what to say
Now I've finished with commonplace.


How I hate the slope of that cheerless chin,
And the stare of those vacant eyes,
That take the commonest objects in
With placid and cool surprise.


And I sit in a calm that she will not break,
A desert that is not peace,
And ever and ever the windows shake
To a dance that will never cease.


I cannot join the rout again,
I am far too weary and warm.
So I needs must suffer this speechless pain,
In a draught, on the red baize form.


There is one remark&mdash;it has proved a key
Already to one long chat,
Of course&mdash;I'll start it, for even she
Must answer awhile to that.


But horror! my agonised fingers curl,
Did I say it to her? I think
It must have been to that other girl
In the delicate shrimp-sauce pink.


Shall I chance it again! I must! I will!
With a stammer I've half begun&mdash;
Saved! saved! the music at last is still.
Thank goodness, the dance is done.

A WINTER WEDDING.



When bleak, bluff, blatant blizzards blew,
And hats from storm-tossed heads were carried,
My enterprising friend, then you
Got married!


Soon spring had come, when doves can coo,
And flowers blossom, had you tarried;
Instead, in January you
Got married.


Then in your honeymoon you two
The gloom and snow of winter parried;
It's two to one two won when you
Were married.


And thus henceforward may you do;
By life's rough storms be never harried,
Together face them all now you
Are married.




More Anglomania!

recognised.&mdash;Daily Paper.]

Deux Mots.&mdash;The retirement of one of the
oldest and most popular actors of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise may be summed
up in two words, "Got: gone."



"ART IS LONG&mdash;&mdash;"

The Daily Graphic of February 1, commenting on the
time-contest between two pianists, suggests that exponents of the
other fine arts should follow their example. The idea has been taken
up at the Royal Aquarium with great success, as will be seen from the
following press-cuttings:&mdash;

From the "Magazine of Art."

The Directors of the Aquarium are to be congratulated on their new
departure, which takes the form of a highly exciting and sportsmanlike
contest between those two well-known entertainers Professor
Herr Komer and Se√±or
Hardli Duddi in their great poster-painting
exhibition. This consists of a trial of strength and endurance, the
challenger, Se√±or Duddi, having given out
that he will beat Professor Komer's
previous record in time and area combined by one hour and a hundred
square yards. As the public are well aware, the latter performer's
sensational achievement, "Miss Letty Lind," stands at present
unbeaten as an artistic poster, having far eclipsed his "All
Beautiful in Naked Purity," which attracted such attention on the
Royal Academy hoardings last year. As to time, his
Lind tour de force (shown at the
Society of Portrait Painters at the New Gallery last autumn) was
painted in one continuous whirl or sitting of fifty hours duration,
and would have taken even longer, had not the accomplished
danseuse fainted from exhaustion. (It is understood, by the
way, that Miss Lind has issued a challenge
that she will pirouette against the world, including Lord
Yarmouth and Little
Tich.)

Se√±or Duddi has hitherto made his mark
with presentments of ultra-chic young ladies, which have
certainly taken up a great deal of space, and fulfilled their purpose
as "eye-openers." We have no details as to the time in which they were
designed, but we should think about twenty minutes on an average.

As the Aquarium contest will not be concluded until after we go to
press, we cannot give the result, but at the time of writing, after
three days' painting without cessation, Mr.
Komer had covered a quarter of an acre of
canvas, while Mr. Duddi had traversed three
hundred yards of advertisement hoarding. Both were going well and
strong, the only people showing signs of exhaustion being the umpires
and spectators.

From the "Sporting Times."

What will our dear friends of the Anti-Sporting League say to this?
Here's yet another form of iniquity, the Poet Stakes at the Aquarium!
We looked in last night at that classic abode, and found them all hard
at it in the Bijou Theatre. We soon made a pretty book, and only
regret we hadn't entered Ballyhooly and
Doss Chiderdoss. A black-haired colt was
making the pace with what he called "beautiful prose music," quite as
good as any we turn out in our first page. But the backers rather
fancied a Chestnut Pegasus, who was going well within his stride with
his "Odes and Poems." There were one or two other dark horses in the
field, that we put down for a place. That worthy and veteran
sportsman, and cutest of tipsters, G.
Allen, wielded the flag, and got his little lot off, as we were
told, with only ten false starts. We left at the fifty-seventh hour,
when the leaders had completed two hundred and twenty laps of very
blank verse and other paces, it being a go-as-you-please contest. A
sonnet divided the first and second, and there was an epigram and a
half between the second and the third. As it promised to be a
long-winded affair, and rather too noisy for our refined and delicate
constitutions, we retired early. We give the odds, however, on another
page.

  A PARLIAMENTARY HOUSE WARMING!
  (Parties are often rendered very Attractive
  by the adoption of Fancy Dress!)

[pg 71]



ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

Tuesday, February 5.&mdash;House filled once more with bustle of
new Session. Lobby crowded. Corridors, long silent, burst into
bustling life. "Seems to me," says Jemmy
Lowther, looking on with his juvenile-veteran air, "that the
happiest day in a member's life is the first of a Session, if indeed
the cup of his joy isn't fuller on the day of prorogation."

For some the jubilation of the hour is toned down by saddened
thought. There is one step that will never more be heard in the lobby,
one familiar face seen here no more, one voice, wont to sway the
passions of the House, that now is still.
Lycidas is dead, not quite ere his prime,
but in what, had fate been kinder, should have been the fulness of his
rich gifts.

The House knew Grandolph, as he
presented himself to its notice from various points of view. First, an
unknown new Member, rising from bench immediately behind Ministers, a
situation which, deliberately chosen, seemed to observant Whips to
indicate pleasurable prospect of docility. Next, whilst his Party was
still in office, he popped up from front bench below gangway, and
pricked at ponderous hide of Sclater-Booth,
pink of respectability, sublimation of county-gentry-Toryism. Then,
with sudden brilliancy and sustained force, he rose on the firmament
below the gangway in Opposition, tilting almost single-handed at the
panoplied host, a majority over a hundred strong, that seemed to make
Mr. G.'s second Administration invulnerable. For a moment in a famous
night in June he was seen standing jubilant on his seat at the corner
of the bench, waving his hat, shouting himself hoarse with cries of
victory. From this elevation he sprang lightly on to the Treasury
Bench, and astonished Members who, with him, had heard the chimes at
midnight and after, by the quiet dignity of his manner, his unerring
tact, his unfailing skill of management. Never since the time
Prince Hal, boon companion of Falstaff, became King
Henry the Fifth, has there been seen such transformation.


Never was such a sudden scholar made;
Never came reformation in a flood,
With such a heady currance, scouring faults;
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
So soon did lose his seat, and all at once,
As in this king.


The succeeding Session had a fresh surprise. It found our
Grandolph, self-reduced to the ranks,
caressing his moustache on the corner seat behind the Treasury Bench.
After a while he wearied of the invidious position, and went off to
the races, to Norway a-fishing, to South Africa to observe the ways of
lions from precarious proximity. But his heart was, after all, at
Westminster. He came back broken in health, undaunted in spirit.
Nothing pluckier, nothing more pathetic seen in the House than his
long stubborn fight against the paralysis that crept over him even as
he stood at the table and tried to weave again the magic spell by
which he once held the House.

He died as he lived, fighting, keeping Death at arm's length for a
full month after the highest authorities had said it was a mistake to
be such an unconscionably long time in dying.

The House of Commons will know Grandolph
no more. But it will never forget one who will through all time rank
among the most brilliant of its sons.



Something decidedly hysterical about jubilation of the hour.
Prevalent hilarity suggests case of crowded passenger ship, having
been in imminent danger of shipwreck, suddenly steams into
comparatively placid seas.


  "MR. R-S-B-RY'S" DREAM.
  Mr. R-s-b-ry. "Hullo! Where's the House of Lords?"
  Spectral Caretaker. "''Ouse o' Lords,' Sir? Why, it's GONE!!"


"If," says Wilfrid Lawson, an authority
on Church matters, "it were customary to commence the Session by
singing a hymn I know what Squire of
Malwood would give out. It's the one beginning


And are we still alive
And see each other's face?


Thought it was to be all over before Christmas; Cabinet broken up;
everybody retiring; Parliament dissolved; demoralised Party finally
smashed up at polls; the other side left to settle who was to be who
in best of all Governments. 'Instead of which,' as the Judge said,
here we are in for a long Session, with, as usual, more work on hand
than could be done in two."

"So you haven't resigned after all?" I remarked, getting up on a
chair to have a chat with the Squire of
Malwood.

"Et tu, Toby!" he cried. "I
thought better of your intelligence. I welcome re-opening of Session
for one thing. Obliged to be in my place every night. Whilst House is
sitting people will see I haven't resigned. That should&mdash;don't know
that it will&mdash;check to certain extent what at Derby I ventured
distantly to allude to as mendacious inventions. I have, as you know,
had a somewhat troublesome time during recess. Rarely got up in
morning but found by newspapers I had resigned overnight. Seldom went
to bed without conviction derived from glancing over evening papers
that I had upset the Ministerial coach&mdash;I, the mildest mannered man
that ever sat in Cabinet Council. Daresay you remember incident in
almost equally troubled career of Louis the
Sixteenth. When he was brought back to Paris and lodged in
Tuileries after his flight to Varennes, the sans-culottes,
Messieurs et Madames, could not sleep in their beds at night
from apprehension that king had again escaped. They used to make up
little family parties, stroll down to Tuileries, mass themselves
before the King's bedroom window, and call upon
Louis Capet to show himself. The King
thereupon got out of bed, put on red Cap of Liberty and showed himself
at the window. 'Mes enfants,' he said, 'you see I am here.'
'Tres bien,' said Monsieur, Madame, et le
B√©b√©, and trudged back content to the Faubourg St. Antoine. Now
that was all very well for a King. But you know,
Toby, it can't be expected of me in
so-called holiday times to be constantly attending knocks at the front
door, or even getting up in the dead of night, showing myself at the
window, and saying, 'My good newspaper friends, I have not
resigned.'"

Business done.&mdash;Just commenced.



"The Portrait of Nobody."&mdash;When the
signature "O&#965;&#964;&#953;&#962;" first appeared to a pamphlet or
an article, people wondered "who 'tis?" and "'ow 'tis he knows all
about it?" The signature appearing again to an article in The New
Review, No. 69, suggests that though the author has an
anti-scriptural objection to a single-eyed individual, perhaps
'O&#965;&#964;&#953;&#962;' simply indicates a person who, with the
majority of us, detests an egotist. Only one would hardly gather this
explanation of the assumption of this classic and poetic signature
from the style of the article.



Not a Gilt-edged Security.&mdash;The
investment of Wei-hai-wei.

[pg 72]




  "ANIMAL SPIRITS."&mdash;No. 3. THE BARN DANCE.




TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.

I.&mdash;THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (continued.)

It did not take me long to make my preparations and devise my
plans. In such matters as these I have always found it best to prepare
for every possible contingency, and then, with a trustful heart, to
leave the rest to chance. I therefore calculated to a nicety the
number of miles we should have to traverse, took into account the
physical configuration of the country through which we should have to
pass, the height of its various mountains, the depth of its valleys,
the breadth and current of its rivers, its capacity for food supply,
and the nature of its inhabitants. Having done all this, I spare the
reader unnecessary details. It would profit him but little if I were
to set down exactly the equipment, the clothing, the arms, and all the
other preparations which my matchless experience prompted me to make.
Such an expedition as that which I was about to engage in can never be
undertaken again, for the simple reasons that there are now no pink
hippopotami in the world, and that improved methods of communication,
ridiculous railways, absurd telegraphs, preposterous telephones, and
ludicrously well-metalled roads have robbed life, even in
Seringapatam, of all the romance which, in my younger days, cast a
halo of adventure round the smallest undertaking. How gloriously we
revelled, how grandly we fought, how magnificently contemptuous we
were of danger! But now we clothe ourselves in patent wool, we tremble
at the shadow of a policeman, we judge everything by the mean standard
of its money value. Some day we shall awake from our dreams of false
security, when the crash of invasion sounds in our ears, and we see
our homesteads ruthlessly trampled down by the hoof of some despised
and foreign foe. Then, when it is too late, the public will remember
that England still possesses one great leader inured to hardship and
danger from his earliest youth, one whom, though a perverse Parliament
has slighted him, the greatest warriors and the gallantest sportsmen
have been proud to salute as their unquestioned superior. I shall
answer to the call with what strength I may still possess, and my
prematurely grizzled hair shall be seen waving in the van of my
country's defenders; but even an Orlando
Wilbraham (have I mentioned that that was my name?) must fail
if he has only shop-reared dummies to support his efforts. Enough,
however, of these mournful prognostications.




My preparations, then, were quickly made. I resolved on confining
the numbers of the expedition within the smallest possible limits,
and, after much thought, I decided to take only one associate. My
choice fell upon Major Theophilus
Ganderdown. He had gone through the whole of the previous
campaign with me, and had proved his solid worth on many a hard-fought
field. A man, like myself, of herculean strength, and of inexhaustible
endurance, he was eminently fitted to help me in those perilous
situations in which I had no doubt we should find ourselves before the
adventure was over and the task performed. It was not his fault that
he lacked those brilliant powers of initiative, that wonderful
ingenuity of resource for which I had already become famous. But one
genius of that kind is sufficient in any adventure, and I knew that
for courage, strength, and bulldog tenacity, I could reckon on
Ganderdown to the death.

We fixed our start for a Thursday, always a lucky day for any
expedition in which I have been engaged. I gave
Ganderdown rendezvous at the western gate,
at midnight, and bade him maintain the complete secrecy in which all
our plans had hitherto been involved. I myself set forth when dinner
was over to bid farewell to the beautiful and affectionate
Chuddah, the last scion of the glorious
Rampore dynasty, who was at that time dwelling in the little marble
palace on the outskirts of the park of her vindictive aunt, the Ranee
of Seringapatam.

Ah, Chuddah, loveliest of olive maidens,
even now, when I think of thee, this war-worn heart beats faster in my
breast, and the unaccustomed tear trickles down a cheek seamed by many
a scar. How different would my life have been had cruel fate not
stepped in to prevent us from fulfilling those mutual vows of eternal
love which we had pledged to one another, I, who water these lines
with my tears, might now have been the ruler over hosts of dusky
myrmidons, the acclaimed chief of the fierce and warlike Ch√¢l tribes,
whilst thou, a queen, a wife, a mother, wouldst have&mdash;&mdash; But, bah,
these wailing regrets are unmanly. To my story.

(To be continued.)

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
