PREFACE.


In the summer of 1866, having lately concluded a tour
of inspection through the West and South, and
awaiting orders in Washington, it was my fortune one
morning to receive the following:




"Quartermaster-General's Office, }
"Washington, D. C., July 10, 1866. }


"General:       You will immediately enter upon a
tour of inspection of the affairs of the Quartermaster's
Department, as administered at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, and thence west via Denver City and Salt Lake
City to the Pacific Coast, inspecting all intermediate
Posts while en route. At Denver City you will confer
with Brevet Col. Howard, A. Q. M., as to the practicability
of breaking up that depot, and removing the
stores to other points where needed. Thence to Salt
Lake City, where a rigid inspection is needed. Thence
to San Francisco, Cal.

"Upon reaching the Pacific Coast, you will confer
with the Commanding General and Chief Quartermaster
of the Military Division of the Pacific, and having procured
necessary information relative to the locality,
importance, etc. of the various Posts, you will proceed
upon a careful inspection throughout California, Oregon,[Pg iv]
Nevada, and Washington and Arizona Territories.
Upon completing this duty, you will return to this city,
via the Isthmus, and report in person to the Quartermaster-General.

"It will be necessary to keep this Office fully informed,
in advance, as to your probable whereabouts, so
that instructions may be telegraphed to you at the
stations where you are on duty when necessary.

"You are authorized to take a clerk with you.




"Very respectfully,
"Your ob't serv't.,
"M. C. MEIGS,
"Quartermaster-General, }
"Brevet Maj.-Gen., U. S. A." }
"Brevet Brig.-Gen. James F. Rusling, }
"Inspector Q. M. Dep't." }


These, my orders, were subsequently endorsed as
follows:




"Headquarters of the Army, }
"Washington, D. C., July 18, 1866. }


"Commanding officers will, on the requisition of
Gen. Rusling, furnish the necessary escorts to enable
him to make the within directed inspections.


"By command of Lieut.-Gen. Grant,
"GEO. K. LEET,
"Ass't. Adj't.-Gen."


The general object of this tour, perhaps I should
explain, in a word, was to examine into the condition of
our various depots and posts West, and consider their[Pg v]
bases and routes of supply, with a view to reducing if
possible the enormous expenditures, that then everywhere
prevailed there. How well or ill this was accomplished,
it is not for me to say, nor is this volume the
place       my Reports at the time speaking for themselves.[1]

The route thus roughly indicated was long, and in
parts reputed dangerous; but for years I had cherished
a desire to see something of that vast region in the sunset,
and here at length was the golden opportunity. I
need scarcely say, therefore, that I obeyed my orders
with alacrity, and in the execution of them was absent
in all about a twelvemonth. During that period, crossing
the continent to San Francisco, among the Mountains,
along the Pacific Coast, and thence home by the
Isthmus, I travelled in all over 15,000 miles, as per
accompanying Map; of which about 2,000 were by railroad,
2,000 by stage-coach, 3,000 by ambulance or on
horseback, and the remainder by steamer. This book,
now, is the rough record of it all, written at odd
hours since, as occasion offered. Much of this journey,
of course, was over the old travelled routes, so well
described already by Bowles, Richardson, Nordhoff, and
others. But several hundred miles of it, along and
among the Rocky Mountains, a thousand or so through
Utah and Idaho, and perhaps two thousand or more
through Southern California and Arizona, were through
regions that most overland travellers never see; and here,[Pg vi]
at least, I trust something was gleaned of interest and
profit to the general reader. Moreover, my official
orders gave me access to points not always to be reached,
and to sources of information not usually open; so that
it was my duty, as well as pleasure, to see and hear as
much of the Great West and the Pacific Coast everywhere,
as seemed practicable in such a period.

Of course, I kept a rough diary and journal (apart
from my official Reports), and retiring from the army in
1867, perhaps these should have been written out for
publication long ago, if at all. But it proved no easy
task to settle down again into the harness of civil life,
after being six years in the army, as all "old soldiers" at
least well know. I plead only this excuse for my delay       the
absorption of a busy life and health not firm; and
trust these notes on Western life and scenery, if lacking
somewhat in immediate freshness, will yet be considered
not altogether stale. The completion of the Pacific Rail
road, it will be noted, made this long tour of mine, by
stage-coach and ambulance, through the Great West and
along the Pacific Coast, about the last, if not the last, of
its kind possible; and, therefore, under all the circumstances,
it has seemed not unfitting, even at this late
date, to give these pages to the world.

Writing only for the general public, it will be
noticed, I have tried everywhere to avoid all military
and official details, as far as practicable, and to confine
myself mainly to what would seem of interest, if not
value, to everybody. So, too, I have aimed to bridge[Pg vii]
the interval from 1866-7 to 1874 by such additional
facts as appeared necessary; but without, however,
modifying my own observations and experiences materially.
If some persons, and some localities, are spoken
of more flatteringly (or less) than usual, it is at least
with truthfulness and candor, as things seemed to me.
No doubt errors of fact have been committed, but
these were not intended; and some of these, of course,
were simply unavoidable in a book like this. So, too,
as to style, no pretension whatever is made; but I claim
merely an honest endeavor to convey some useful, if not
interesting information currente calamo, in the readiest
way possible, and a generous public will forgive much
accordingly.

In brief, if what is here roughly said will lead any
American to a better love of his country, or to a truer
pride in it, or any foreigner to a kindlier appreciation of
the Republic, verily I have my reward.

Across America;

OR,

THE GREAT WEST AND THE PACIFIC COAST.





CHAPTER I.

FROM NEW YORK TO FORT RILEY, KANSAS.


Across America, from New York to San Francisco,
may be roughly estimated as three thousand miles.
The first third of this occupied us only about three days
and three nights, though the whole trip consumed just less
than a twelve-month. From New York to St. Louis,
via Cincinnati, was our first stage, and of course by railroad.
We left New York, Tuesday, July 24, 1866, by
the Erie Railway, and on the following Thursday afternoon
reached St. Louis in time for a late dinner. Tarrying
here a day or two, to pick up some information about
the Plains, we passed on to Leavenworth; and thence,
after a longer pause to Fort Riley. The Union Pacific
Railroad, Eastern Division (or Kansas Pacific, as it is
now generally called), halted then at Waumega, some
thirty miles from Fort Riley, whence we reached Riley
by stage-coach. The coach itself was a lumbering,
weather-beaten vehicle, with sorry teams of horses; it
was a hot August afternoon, with rolling clouds of dust;[Pg 22]
we had nine passengers inside and three outside, with
freight and baggage everywhere; and altogether this
little stage-ride was a good initiation into the mysteries
and miseries of stage-coaching across the continent.

From New York to St. Louis is already a series of
towns and cities, with the country as a whole well settled
up, for America. The Great West, it is soon seen, is no
longer the valley of Ohio and the prairies of Illinois. It
has long since crossed the Mississippi, and emigrated
beyond the Missouri. What used to be called the "West"
has already become the centre; and "out west" now
means Kansas or Colorado, if anything at all. The Erie
road, with its broad-gauge coaches, takes you through
the picturesque, as well as rich and fertile regions of
northern New Jersey, and western New York, whence
the ride through Ohio, down the lovely valley of the
Miami to Cincinnati, is substantially as through a garden.
Over much of this region, it is plain to be seen, New
England has left her mark, never to be effaced. Her
school-houses and churches, her intelligence and thrift,
are all reproduced (only slightly westernized), and one
can see that he is in Yankee-land still at a glance. You
might know it, by the omnipresence of white paint and
green blinds, if nothing else. You see it in the average
inhabitant and detect it in his speech. And yet it is
Yankee-land, with enlarged freedom and independence
of thought and action, and therefore doubly welcome.
Southern Indiana and Illinois, you find rapidly filling
up; but they still seem much behind that sunny heart
of Ohio, the Miami Valley. Populated largely by the
overflow from Kentucky and Tennessee       chiefly the
"poor whites" of those former slave states       the results
are everywhere unmistakable. Evidently, even to the
passing traveller, the average Hoosier or Sucker, as yet,[Pg 23]
is much behind the average Buckeye, and he will find
it a hard task to overtake him. The lineal descendant
of the Cavalier and the Corncracker, how can he expect
to compete successfully with the regular representative
of the Roundhead and the Yankee?

Cincinnati and St. Louis strike you as large and
growing cities; but they do not impress you like Chicago,
at least as she did before the great fire. They seem to
have taken Quaker Philadelphia, as their type and model,
rather than buoyant New York. Many of their streets,
you find similarly named, and a like atmosphere pervades
much of their business. In talking with their
magnates of trade and finance, you note a conservative
tone, that illy accords with your ideas of the West, and
you are inclined to wonder whether the far-famed push
and pluck of that romantic region are not myths after
all. Buffalo and Toledo, Cleveland and Chicago, however,
would soon undeceive you       especially, Chicago.
The push and drive, the enterprise and elan of New
York, that are reproduced so well along our northern tier
of cities, all culminated at Chicago       at least before the
fire       until she seemed New York incarnate or even
intensified. The metropolis and brain of the northwest,
how a day in her busy streets braced and inspired one!
With all her brave memories of the past, no wonder she
still believes enthusiastically in herself, and even in her
ashes doubted not her future!

St. Louis, long her rival in trade, we found just
beginning to recover from the benumbing effects of
slavery and the rebellion. The rebellion, sealing up her
railroads and extinguishing her down-river trade, had
given her a bad set back. But she was already fast picking
up the broken threads of her commerce, and was
again preparing to contend with Chicago for the palm of[Pg 24]
supremacy. Seated on the Mississippi, with a vast
river trade up and down, and an immense region back
of her, her geographical position could scarcely be surpassed,
and no doubt she has a grand and noble future
before her. Her levees, we found, thronged with steamers,
some up for New Orleans 1,200 miles south; others
for Fort Benton 3,100 miles north and west. Her population
already exceeded a quarter of a million. Her
suburbs were steadily filling up, in spite of numerous
sinkholes in the limestone formation there. Her streets
were already well gridironed with horse-railroads. Her
facilities for business were large and increasing. And
with her vast system of rivers, north to the British Dominion
and south to the gulf, and her rapidly developing
back country       even to the Rocky Mountains and
New Mexico       nature seems to have destined her to
become the great and abiding metropolis of all that
region. Her vast bridge and tunnels were not yet
begun, but she was already prophesying great things for
the future.

From St. Louis, three hundred miles through Missouri,
to Leavenworth, Kansas, you find a noble region,
that needs only a live population to make it a garden.
It is mostly rich rolling prairie, but with more timber
and streams than in Illinois, and with limestone abounding
nearly everywhere. All along the route, it was
plain to be seen, Missouri had suffered sadly from slavery.
Both in population and business, in town and country,
clearly "the trail of the serpent" had been over her all.
But the wave of immigration, now that slavery was dead,
had already reached her, and we found its healthful currents
everywhere overflowing her bottoms and prairies.
The new-comers seemed to be largely Yankee and German,
almost everywhere. France once so predominant[Pg 25]
here, was already supplanted by Germany, and the Teuton
bade fair to rule Missouri soon, even then. At Hermann,
where we stopped for dinner, a German Hebe
tendered us excellent native wine, and the culture of the
grape, we learned, had already become a leading industry
of this section of the state. The sturdy Rhine-men,
as true to freedom as in the days of Tacitus, were already
everywhere planting vineyards, and in the near future
were sure of handsome returns from petty farms, that our
old time "Pikes" and "Border Ruffians" would have
starved on. Throughout the ride, the Missouri or Big-Muddy,
as the Indians call it, was often in sight, a broad
tawny stream; and many of its bends and reaches were
so beautiful, that it hardly seemed to deserve that savage
criticism of Bayard Taylor's, as being "too lazy to wash
itself." Its banks as a rule are higher and better, than
those of the Mississippi anywhere below Cairo, and its
bottom lands seemed unsurpassed in fertility.

Leavenworth, on the Missouri, where it takes a final
bend north, was still the entrepôt for New Mexico and
the plains. Omaha had already tapped the Colorado
and Utah trade and travel, and has since mainly absorbed
them, by the completion of the Union Pacific railroad.
But Leavenworth still had a large trade and travel of her
own, as a point of departure for New Mexico and the
Plains, and seemed destined to maintain it. Only a
decade or so before, she was without a house or inhabitant;
but now she claimed thirty-thousand people, and
was rapidly increasing. We found many handsome
stores and elegant residences everywhere going up.
Her streets were fast being graded and macadamized, and
the guttering especially was most solid and substantial.
She had several daily papers already, with weekly
editions of a large circulation. Many of her stores were[Pg 26]
doing a wholesale business of a million of dollars
annually. A fine Catholic church was being erected,
which when completed promised to be the chief ornament
of the city. But the largest and showiest building there
then was a combined brewery and dance house, which
augured badly for the town. Off on the suburbs of the
city, we passed a park of wagons or "prairie-schooners,"
acres in extent, tangible evidence that we had already
struck the commerce of the Plains.

By Lawrence and Topeka, already towns of several
thousand people, over the historic plains of Kansas, we
sped along up the valley of the Kaw or Kansas to
Waumega; and thence, as I have said, by stage to Fort
Riley. Junction City, just beyond Fort Riley, at the
confluence of the Republican and Smoky Hill rivers, we
found to be a hamlet of several hundred people, and
already growing rapidly. It had been projected, with
the expectation that the railroad would bend north here,
and ascending the Republican go thence to Denver,
which would have made Junction the last station and
grand depot for all New Mexico and much of the Rocky
Mountain region. But, as it had been decided afterwards
to keep on up the Smoky Hill instead, Junction had
missed of much of its importance. Its location, however,
was good, at the confluence thus of two rivers;
and with its single street of straggling houses, of all
styles of architecture, and in every stage of construction,
it was a good specimen of a frontier town, in the first
year of its settlement.

The country as a whole, thus far through Kansas,
much surpassed our expectations. Not only were the
broad bottoms of the Kaw everywhere dotted with
farms, but even the high rolling prairies beyond were
fast settling up. Of course, settlements grew more[Pg 27]
scattering the farther we progressed westward; but they
were always in sight and everywhere rapidly increasing.
Herds of horses and cattle grazed along the bottoms, and
grouse and sage-hens whirred up by the roadside as we
sped along. At one point, a brace of oxen, yoked
together, got upon the track, and our engine mangled the
poor beasts dreadfully before they escaped. The road,
as yet, was poorly ditched, and without fences on either
side, so that horses and cattle strayed across it quite at
will. The wheat-crop had everywhere been fair, and
Indian corn was promising to be magnificent. Corn had
looked well, all through Ohio and Indiana, Illinois and
Missouri; but in the Kansas bottoms it was superb in its
"embattled glory," and seemed to be a great favorite
with the farmers. Indeed, Kansas, both in soil and
climate, is a rare state, and well worth to freedom all the
blood and treasure she cost us. True she lacks timber;
but so far she had got along, and the weight of testimony
seemed everywhere to be that her growth of timber
improved with the reclamation and settlement of the
country. The Indian was everywhere retiring before
the pale faces, and the autumnal fires ceasing with his
departure, bushes and trees soon appeared, and we heard
repeated instances of springs even breaking out, where
none had been known before. As an offset to her want
of timber, coal had been discovered in many places, and
all through the valley of the Kaw, she has a cream-colored
limestone in the bluffs, that works up beautifully for
building purposes. When first quarried, it is so soft that
a common hand-saw or chisel can dress it into any shape
desired; but exposure to the atmosphere soon hardens it,
and then it continues so. In appearance it resembles
the Milwaukee free-stone, that used to make Michigan
Avenue, Chicago, so handsome and stately, and as a[Pg 28]
building material will prove immensely valuable through
all Southern Kansas. At Junction City it was being
got out by machinery, and fashioned into blocks by horsepower.
A company controlled the business, and as they
could furnish this elegant stone at a much less cost than
lumber or brick, they were anticipating very handsome
profits.

The scenery of Kansas possesses many points of interest,
but as a whole lacks grandeur and sublimity. The
view from Prospect Ridge, back of Leavenworth, up and
down the Missouri, is good; but the landscape from
Indian Point, near Junction City, up the Smoky Hill,
has more scope and variety, and was the finest we saw.
Here, and at other points, are some superb specimens of
river terraces. We counted four and five separate
"benches," as they call them there, or terraces, in many
places, and the ancient water-marks of past geologic ages
seemed very evident. The rounded appearance of the
country generally, cropping out here and there into
rough and misshapen ridges, indicated pretty clearly the
former water-line, and we often interested ourselves in
tracing it for miles.

Kansas, of course, abounds in enterprise and thrift.
Saved to freedom by Sharpe's rifles and the Bible, she
invested largely in the school-house and the church, and
already reaps her fit reward. Her Yankees whittle away
just as cutely as they used to in New England, and her
Western men spread themselves hugely as elsewhere.
Since the war, she had received quite a large accession of
population from our ex-officers and soldiers. We found
specimens of the Boys in Blue scattered almost everywhere,
and usually they were doing well. A fine esprit du corps
animated them, and will keep them knit together for the
future. At various points we found them just "squatted"[Pg 29]
on a quarter-section, and with the very rudest surroundings,
but ever plucky and hopeful. At Junction we met
a late Paymaster, U. S. Vol's., who was half-owner of the
chief grocery and liquor-store, as well as partner in a
stone-quarry, and was about establishing a National Bank.
He was a man of spirit and enterprise, and seemed to
have enough surplus energy left for several more
employments.

At Leavenworth, up at the old Fort, we saw our first
Indians       a party of Delawares. They consisted of Fall-Leaf,
war-chief of the Delawares, his nephew General
Jackson, and a handful of other braves. They were
dressed in the usual rough costume of the border, but
with an eagle-feather or two in their broad-brimmed sombreros
trailing in the wind. Fall-Leaf was a noble specimen
of the Indian in a half-civilized state. He was a
brawny, athletic, powerful fellow, five feet eleven inches
high, weighed one hundred and ninety-six pounds, and
was fifty-five years old. A perfect mass of bone and muscle,
without an ounce of superfluous flesh, his frame was a
sight to look upon       especially the massive splendor of his
neck and chest. A Hercules of the Plains, we could well
believe the stories told of his great strength and powers
of endurance. General Jackson was a lithe, light-built
man, about thirty-six years of age, and in physique
almost the opposite of his brawny uncle. Three of them
had just been engaged as guides to a military expedition
about leaving for the Indian country, and a fourth was
going along as interpreter. Fall-Leaf had long served the
government, with marked fidelity, as guide on the Plains
and in the far Indian country, and received one hundred
and fifty dollars per month and rations when absent on
such duty. He was familiar with the whole country
west, as far as the Rocky Mountains, and southward to[Pg 30]
New Mexico, and was reputed as invaluable in his way.
He told me the Delawares numbered about a thousand
souls yet, and had stood at those figures for several years.
They occupy a Reservation of several thousand acres on
the Missouri just below Leavenworth, and are engaged
generally in farming and stock-raising. They have a
church, pretty generally attended, and a good school, well-patronized.
He said his people were fully impressed
with the importance of education and religion, and generally
there was an earnest desire among them to have
their children learn all "Pale-Face ways." He said he
took a drink of "fire-water" himself occasionally, on cold
or wet days, and rather liked it; but that, as a rule,
drunkenness was on the decrease among the Delawares,
and he was glad of it. He had a wife and eight children,
and said they allowed "only one wife at a time in his tribe."
He said he was born far away toward the rising sun, on a
river among the mountains; and when I showed him a
map, he immediately pointed out the head-waters of the
Delaware. When I told him I had just come from there,
and that my "wigwam" stood upon its banks, he seemed
greatly interested. The first steamboat he ever saw, was
many years before at St. Louis, and he thought it "Very
good," because "It went itself! Puff! Puff! No paddle!"
His first locomotive, was quite recently at Leavenworth,
and he thought it "Much good! Went whiz! Beat buffalo
or pony!" Of the telegraph, he said, "I no understand;
but very much good! Heap swift! Like arrow or
bullet between wide places; only heap better!"

He said, the Delawares believed in the Great Manitou,
who made earth, and sky, and everything; but many
did not believe in the Evil Manitou. He himself seemed
to be a pretty good Universalist. He thought God
"very much good," and couldn't imagine how any lesser[Pg 31]
being could interfere with Him. "Perhaps, Evil Manitou
somewhere; but Fall-Leaf know only Good Manitou."
He admitted some of his people believed in spirits; but
he himself had never seen any, and was skeptical on the
whole subject. Some medicine-men, he said, claimed to
have seen them, and to be able to control them; but he
thought the whole thing "a heap humbug."

Fall-Leaf, as I have said, was then War Chief of the
Delawares. In his time he had been quite a noted warrior,
and was proud of his reputation for bravery and
prowess. His last fight against the Plains Indians had
been about two years before, when he covered the retreat
of a squad of infantry, from a body of mounted Cheyennes
and Arrapahoes, and brought them all safely off.
His last fight at the head of the Delawares had been
some ten years before, when with less than fifty warriors
he encountered and fought over two hundred Pawnees,
and whipped them well. Altogether, he supposed, he
had killed and scalped two or three hundred Indians, in
his time; but never a pale-face. He was a dignified and
quiet enough looking Red Skin to talk to through an interpreter,
and occasionally would grunt out a little broken
English himself; but when roused, and with the fury
of battle upon him, no doubt he would be an ugly customer
to deal with. His face was full of smothered force
and fire, of latent power and fierceness, like a tamed
tiger's; and notwithstanding his peaceful demeanor, he
all the while suggested that a single war-whoop, or a
scalping-knife flashing through the air, would speedily
transform the gentle Fall-Leaf into a hideous savage again.

Beyond Topeka we passed St. Mary's, a Catholic
Mission among the Pottawotamies. These Indians had a
Reservation there then thirty miles square, of as fine land
as there was in Kansas. Stock-raising seemed to be their[Pg 32]
chief occupation, though they had some fields well
fenced, and their corn crops were looking well. They
lived in one-story log-cabins, and by dint of years of
hard work the missionaries had succeeded in reducing
them to a sort of semi-civilization; but the aborigine
survived still, and cropped out fearfully everywhere. It
was an anomaly and an anachronism to see them driving
teams and threshing grain; and they themselves seemed
to confess it by their awkwardness. Beyond Manhattanville
we met en route a large party of them       braves,
squaws and papooses       returning from a Buffalo hunt on
the Plains. Some were in wagons with their spoils of
buffalo meat and robes; but the majority went careering
along on horseback. Most of them were in semi-civilized
costume, not much rougher than an average borderer,
though their head-gear usually ran much to feather. A
few of their young squaws were decidedly pretty and
piquant, and, as they ambled by on their gaily-caparisoned
ponies, created quite a sensation among us; but the
older ones were hideous looking hags.

In all this part of Kansas, the Indian had already had
his day, and everywhere was being fast eliminated. The
valleys of the Kaw and its two chief tributaries, the Republican
and Smoky Hill, had already heard the whistle of
the white man's locomotive, and the whole region there
was beginning to shake with the tread of the onward
march of civilization. As "Bleeding Kansas," she had
had her dark days; but these, happily, were past, and
the tide wave of eastern immigration was now surging
and swelling all up and down her borders. We met
cheery voices and friendly hands at every stage of progress;
and could not but bid Kansas a hearty God-speed
as we journeyed on.

CHAPTER II.

FROM THE KANSAS TO THE PLATTE.


It was the middle of August, before I was ready to
leave Fort Riley; and now a word about my compagnons
du voyage. These were two, Mr. J. D. L. of Boston,
my well-tried clerk and friend; and Dr. B. E. M. of New
York, then recently Ass't. Editor                Magazine.
Mr. L. had been with me for several years in the field
and at post; was active, intelligent, alert; and was as
capital a shot, as he was rare a penman. Dr. M. I knew
but slightly; but he came well-recommended, as a
literateur and gentleman, and I was glad to have his
company. He had been considerable of a traveller in
Europe, and was now desirous of crossing the Continent
to San Francisco, whence he might go over to Japan
and China. Another gentleman had also talked much
of joining us; but his heart failed him at the last hour,
and he preceded us to California, via the Isthmus.

My inspections at Leavenworth and Riley being completed,
we left Fort Riley just after sunrise Aug. 16th, and
soon were fairly afloat on the Plains, and off for the
Pacific. Hitherto the railroad had still served to connect
us with the East. But now we bade good-bye to
cars and locomotives, and did not see them again until
we heard their tramp and whistle two thousand miles
away, in the cañon of the Columbia. "Afloat," I think,[Pg 34]
is the only right word for the Plains; because the first
impression they give you is that of the sea, so vast is
their extent, and even the wagons that cross them       huge,
lumbering, fore-and-aft vehicles, with from eight to ten
yoke of oxen each       in border parlance are called "Prairie-Schooners."

My orders were to proceed from Fort Riley on the
Kaw or Kansas, to Fort Kearney on the Platte; and, as
the shortest and most direct route, we were now off,
across the country, in execution of them. Our route lay
northwest across the high "divide" between the Kansas
and the Platte, through central Kansas; and as there
was no stage-line here, we had to go by ambulance.
Neither was there any well-defined road; but we were
told that at Marysville, some sixty miles north, we could
strike the great Overland Route, from Atchison, Mo. and
afterwards travel westward by that. Our "outfit"
consisted of one ambulance for ourselves, one army-wagon
for our escort of five infantry-men, and another
for baggage, forage, and rations. Our friends at Riley
knew little about the intervening country, except that
Indians were reported there; and as their cavalry was
all out scouting, could furnish only the infantry escort,
as above. Even this seemed small; but we were all
well-armed ourselves; and what with our repeating rifles
and revolvers, few as we were, felt good for fifty red
skins or more, come as they would.

For the first seventy-five miles or so, we were seldom
out of sight of scattered ranches; but long before reaching
Fort Kearney       some two hundred and thirty miles from
Riley       they had dwindled away to only the occasional
stage-stations, every ten or twelve miles or so apart.
Along the creeks and streams, we found farms rapidly
springing up; but the "divides" between these were[Pg 35]
generally barren and withered up. Oftentimes we could
find no water for ten or twelve miles, and wood was
even rarer. Of course, we "camped-out" during the
whole trip, and frequently had to carry our necessary fire-wood
fifteen and twenty miles. In the spring, all these
"divides," as well as the bottoms, are clothed with
luxuriant verdure; but in summer, the rainless atmosphere
there sweeps over them, like a sirocco, and everything
soon perishes. At night, we found the air grew
rapidly cold, and we shivered under our blankets; but
in the middle of the day, the sun fairly blazed from a
cloudless sky, and I have seldom felt its effects more
severely. When we struck the Overland Route, we
found its roadway a mass of impalpable dust, black and
stifling. With the breeze dead-ahead, or athwart our
course, we got along very well; but when it chopped
around behind us, the black prairie soil rose in clouds,
and our poor mules suffered terribly. Two of them,
indeed, died outright, from heat and dust, before reaching
the Platte, though we drove very carefully, seldom
averaging over thirty-five miles per day. Evidently this
part of Kansas must grow more trees, and thus secure
more rain and moisture, before these high "divides"
or ridges between the Kansas and the Platte will amount
to much for farming purposes.

After a week of travelling like this, our first sight of
the Platte, with its broad and luxuriant bottoms waving
with verdure, was refreshing to the eye. Our jaded
animals snuffed the water and grass afar off, and of their
own accord broke into a trot as we neared them. We
struck the river at Valley Ranche, a collection of a dozen
or so sod-houses, some seven or eight miles below Fort
Kearney. The Platte here is a mile or more wide, and
looks like a noble stream; but it is shallow and treacherous[Pg 36]
with shoals and quicksands, as well as tainted
with alkali, and altogether is about as thorough a
swindle as a river can well be. Its northern bank was
still fringed with cottonwoods, but its southern had
scarcely a bush to break the monotony. Ascending it
to Fort Kearney, we found its broad bottoms literally
swarming with countless millions of Plains grasshoppers.
They really covered the ground, a moving army; they
filled the air, coming in all directions, their white wings
twinkling like a snow-squall. Egypt's plague of locusts
could scarcely have been worse, for they swept a broad
tract of country clean of everything, as they moved
eastward. We found the settlers complaining of them
bitterly, as the greatest pests of the region, destroying
all vegetation and forbidding all attempts at farming,
some seasons. Said a butternut Missourian, in speaking
of them: "The pesky varmints! They eat up all my
corn, and tobacco. And then when I cussed 'em for it,
they coolly sat on the Shanghai-fence thar, and squirted
tobacco juice at me!" But they have been almost as
bad in other new states, at first, and it was thought the
advance of our line of settlements would soon subdue or
extirpate them.

On leaving Riley, we had anticipated some good
shooting en route; but game generally proved rare, or
else quite shy. Prairie-chickens or grouse abounded
until we got beyond the settlements, when they disappeared
almost entirely. They are a timid bird, and hard
to approach on foot; but on horseback or in a wagon
you may get close upon them very easily. Feeding in
the grass or reeds, in small flocks, at the first sound they
pop their heads up erect, as if inviting the sportsman to
crack away at them. This we did continually from an
ambulance or behind it, and seldom went into camp the[Pg 37]
first few days without prairie-chickens enough for all.
We expected to see deer and buffalo, but were unable to
catch sight of even one, being too far east yet. As we
approached the Platte, we saw a solitary antelope, gazing
at us from a distant bluff; but when we drew nearer he
wheeled about and dashed quickly out of sight among its
sand-hills. Doves and cow-birds appeared in quite considerable
numbers when we struck the Overland Route,
and, of course, the crow or buzzard also       the omnipresent
scavenger of the Plains. Our first prairie-dogs
turned up on the Little Blue, just beyond Thompson's.
Here was quite a village of the little fellows, with their
sentinels duly out; but as we came nearer, the alarm
was sounded, and soon "whisk" went a hundred tails, as
they plunged head downwards into their holes. A few
noses peeped cautiously out as we drove by; but the
most of their dogships continued perdu. Just above
one hole a diminutive owl still stood guard in the deepening
twilight, and the settlers insisted that the old yarn
about the prairie-dog, the owl, and the rattlesnake being
tenants in common       all keeping house in one and the
same hole       is really true. We overheard our teamsters
(all old Plainsmen) disputing about this one night,
around their camp-fire, as we lay awake; but their final
conclusion, and the weight of frontier testimony, seemed
to be in favor of this Happy Family.

Of Indians we heard a great deal, but saw
none. Rumors of them increased as we moved north
and west; but, if about, they gave us a wide berth.
At Virginia Station, about half way, the station-keeper
reported the Pawnees in force on the Little Blue; and at
Big Sandy the last stage-driver through from Fort Kearny
reported Fort Reno taken, Fort Laramie besieged and
Kearny itself in danger. He said, one settler had already[Pg 38]
been lanced and killed on the Little Blue; that the Pawnees
there       six hundred lodges strong       were moody and hostile;
and, as our party was too small for effective resistance
advised our return. Further on we found ranches here
and there abandoned, with the crops left growing; and
one day we descried a solitary horseman in the distance
galloping rapidly towards us, that we were sure must be
a red skin. But as he came nearer he proved to be a
settler's half-grown boy, who had been up the road several
miles helping a neighbor move. He, too, had heard "Big
Injun" stories, but said his people did not mind them
much. These reports, at first, I confess, were rather
startling, as we had no idea of losing our scalps; but as
our safe advance day by day exploded one after another
of them, we soon became quite skeptical on the Indian
question. The chief effect was to increase our prudence
and vigilance. We looked well to our arms morning and
evening, and seldom halted, even briefly, without posting a
guard. In due time we reached and passed the valley of the
Little Blue without seeing a Pawnee       they had all gone off
a fortnight before to the Republican and Smoky Hill to
hunt buffalo       and finally arrived at Fort Kearny in
safety. There they laughed at the idea of Indians south
or east of them, but confessed to ugly reports about
Reno and Laramie. Ultimately, as we got farther west,
these also proved false; and our conclusion as to Big
Injun stories in general, was not very favorable.

The few settlers along the route consisted chiefly of
New Englanders, with a goodly sprinkling of Germans.
They generally had milk and eggs to sell, but seldom
butter or vegetables. We camped one night on Fancy
Creek, near a Mr. Segrist's, where we got tomatoes and
onions, as well as eggs and milk; and as we had shot
several prairie-chickens during the day, we supped[Pg 39]
luxuriously. Our mess-kit was rather a primitive affair,
not much to speak of, and our cook quite a worthless
fellow, as it turned out; but L. developed a talent
that way very surprising, and so we got along comfortably.
This Segrist himself was quite a character in his
way. A Pennsylvania Dutchman by birth, he was bred
in Indiana, but emigrated to Fancy Creek during the
Kansas troubles, to help save the territory to freedom.
Squatting on a quarter-section there, he first built himself
a log-cabin, and then subsequently enlarged and
improved this by a "lean-to;" now he had just completed
a good two-story stone house, of magnesian limestone,
and aspired to luxury. He had flocks and herds
well about him; he was a hearty, cheery man, not afraid
of hard work, nor a spice of danger; and, it was plain
to be seen, would soon be a rich man, if he kept on.
Of course, he was a Republican in politics, and took the
St. Louis Westliche Post.

On Wild-Cat Creek, the first day out from Fort
Riley, we struck a Mr. Silvers, who proved to be a
minister of the United Brethren. He had a half-section
of land there, and his son-in-law as much more just
adjoining. They were both living in rude shanties put
up by themselves, but seemed happy and contented.
During the war, he had sent one son to the army, and
when Price invaded Kansas he himself shouldered his
Plains rifle, and marched to the defence of Lawrence
and Topeka. When at home, he worked upon his farm;
but he had a frontier circuit, with preaching places a
hundred miles in every direction, which took him away
most of the time. He seemed to be a veritable missionary,
looking up the lost sheep scattered along the Border,
and we bade him God-speed. His "gude wife" gave
us a bowl of buttermilk fresh from the churn, and we
paid her in the latest eastern newspapers.



[Pg 40]




CHAPTER III.

UP THE PLATTE TO DENVER.


The Union Pacific Railroad had then just reached
Fort Kearney from Omaha, and was the sensation of
the hour. With a large force of men, it was being pushed
rapidly up the north bank of the Platte; but as our road
lay up the south bank, we did not cross to see it. There
was little to prevent its rapid progress of a mile and even
two miles per day, as the Platte valley ascends gradually,
and for railroad purposes is almost everywhere practically a
level. We now dismissed our ambulance and escort, with
instructions to return to Fort Riley, and transferred ourselves,
bag and baggage, to Holliday's Overland Stages,
which here connected with the railroad.

This stage-line was long one of the first enterprises of
America, and, as the forerunner of the railroad did its
part well in carrying civilization across the continent.
It was then owned and controlled by Mr. Ben Holliday,
an enterprising Missourian, but then living in New
York. It had originally fallen into his hands for debt,
but he had since greatly enlarged and extended it. It
then ran from Fort Kearney to Denver, with branches to
the mining regions; thence across the Rocky Mountains
to Salt Lake;[2] thence through Idaho to the Columbia,
with branches through Montana; extending in all, nearly
three thousand miles, employing six thousand horses and[Pg 41]
mules, and more than three hundred coaches. He paid
his general superintendent ten thousand dollars per year;
his division superintendents, half that; and lesser
employees proportionately. His hay, and grain, and provisions,
he had to haul hundreds of miles, distributing
them along the route, and his fuel frequently one hundred
and fifty. To offset all this, he carried the U. S. Mail,
daily each way, and for this service alone received over
half a million of dollars per year from the government.
In addition, his passenger fares from Fort Kearney to
Denver were one hundred and fifty dollars; to Salt Lake,
three hundred; to Nevada, four hundred and fifty; to
California, five hundred; and to Idaho and Montana,
about the same.

We found his stages to be our well-known Concord
coaches, and they quite surpassed our expectations, both
as to comfort and to speed. They were intended for
nine inside       three seats full       and as many more outside,
as could be induced to get on. Their teams were
either four or six horses, depending on the roads, and
the distance between stations. The animals themselves
were our standing wonder; no broken-down
nags, or half-starved Rosinantes, like our typical stage-horses
east; but, as a rule, they were fat and fiery,
and would have done credit to a horseman anywhere.
Wiry, gamey, as if feeling their oats thoroughly,
they often went off from the stations at a full gallop;
at the end of a mile or so would settle down to a
square steady trot; and this they would usually keep up
right along until they reached the next station. These
"stations" varied from ten to twelve miles apart,
depending on water and grass, and consisted of the
rudest kind of a shanty or sod-house ordinarily. Here
we would find another team, ready harnessed, prancing[Pg 42]
to be gone, and in fifteen minutes or so would be off on
the road again. Halts were made twice a day for meals,
forty minutes each, and with this exception we kept
bowling ahead night and day. Our meals were fair for
the region; generally coffee, beef-steak or bacon, potatoes,
and saleratus-biscuit hot; but the prices       one dollar
and one dollar and a half per meal       seemed extortionate.
In this way, we often made ten and twelve miles per
hour, while on the road; and seldom drove less than one
hundred, and one hundred and twenty-five miles, per day
and night.

We talked a good deal, or essayed to, with the drivers;
but as a rule, they were a taciturn species. Off the box
they were loquacious enough; but when mounted, with
four or six in hand, they either thought it unprofessional
to talk, or else were absorbed too much in their business.
I remarked this to a Division Superintendent, when he
replied, "You bet! A talking driver is like a whistling
girl or crowing hen, always of no account!" They
each had their drive of fifty or sixty miles, up one day,
and back the next, and to the people along the route
were important personages. Many we found were from
New Hampshire, and Western New York. Usually
they were a roving class; but when they once settled
down to stage-driving, they seldom left it permanently.
There seemed to be a fascination about the life, hard as
it was, and we found many of these Jehus who had been
driving for years, and never expected to quit it. They
were fond of tobacco and whiskey, and rolled out ponderous
oaths, when things did not go to suit them; but
as a rule, they were hearty and generous fellows, and
were doing the world good service. As bearers of the
U. S. Mail, they felt themselves kings of the road, and
were seldom loth to show it. "Clar the road! Git out[Pg 43]
of the way thar with your bull-teams!" was a frequent
salutation, when overtaking or meeting wagon-trains;
and if this was not complied with quickly, they made
little hesitation in running into the oxen, and swearing
till all was blue. I have a vivid recollection of one
instance of the kind, when we ran into an ox-team, and
the justly exasperated teamster sent us his compliments,
in the shape of a bullet whizzing through the air, as we
whirled away again.

In fellow-passengers we were remarkably lucky.
Col. B. was a good specimen of the ups and downs of an
average Westerner. He was a graduate of West Point,
or at least had been a cadet there, and afterwards served
some years in the Regular Army. Retiring to civil life,
he subsequently was elected Lieut.-Governor of a western
state, and afterwards became Governor       the incumbent
dying. When the war broke out, he turned up as
Colonel of a volunteer regiment; and now, like the
Irishman, having been "promoted backward," was vegetating
as sutler at a post on the Plains. He was a man
of rare wit and intelligence, of infinite jest and humor
(his own worst enemy), and we were sorry to part when
he reached his post. Then we had a Swiss artist, M.
Buchser, sent over by his government to make a grand
painting illustrative of our late war, embracing our most
famous statesmen and generals, for the Capitol at Berne.
Having a month or two of leisure, he was spending it
wisely in making a run to the Plains and the Rocky
Mountains. Now he was hurrying on to join Gen.
Sherman at Julesburg, whence he was to accompany him
and his brother, the Ohio Senator, on a tour of inspection
to Fort Laramie, Buford, Denver, and then east
again via the Arkansas. He was a close observer, had
travelled much on both continents, and was very chatty[Pg 44]
and companionable, speaking English like a native. He
sketched constantly en route, making "studies" of the
Platte valley from the top of the stage-coach, and when
we parted at Fort McPherson, it was with the mutual
hope of meeting again at Denver. Next we had a
Doctor of Divinity from Illinois, of the Methodist persuasion,
en route to Golden City and the Mountains, in
search of health, and to look after certain mining interests
of some company in the east. Then we had a
banker from New York, of copperhead tendencies, bound
for Idaho City, also in quest of mines; but his wife was
a staunch Republican, and more than offset his political
heresies. We had others besides, merchants, miners,
telegraph-men, etc., and really not one disagreeable
person.

As to the weather, we found that intensely hot in
the middle of the day (it being the last of August and
first of September), but the mornings and evenings were
delightful, and the nights always superb. Most of the
passengers preferred the inside; but Dr. M. and I
chose the outside, which with some inconveniences had
its advantages after all. By day it gave us a wider view
of the country; and at night we used to give our
blankets a "shake down" on the flat top (first borrowing
an armful of hay from some station), and then go luxuriously
to sleep. At first when we tried this, not
understanding the philosophy of the situation, we came
near rolling off when the coach would pitch into a chuck-hole,
or give a lurch from heel to port; but we soon
learned to boom ourselves on, with a rope or strap
from railing to railing, and thus managed to secure
not a little of "tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy
sleep," while our fellow-passengers down below (nine
inside), packed like sardines in a box, got seldom a wink.[Pg 45]
The most of the time, the moon was at the full or about
that, and superb in her unveiled glory. The sky was
packed with a myriad of stars, far beyond what we ever
see east. The air, pure and dry, free from both dew
and frost, was a perpetual tonic to lungs and brain.
Every hundred miles or so we stopped over a day or two
to inspect some Military Post, and so got rested. The
scenery from day to day was ever fresh and changing,
abounding in new sensations. And, in short, in all my
experiences of life, I have few pleasanter recollections
than in thus staging it outside, across the Plains, and up
the Platte to Denver. One night, however, a wind-storm
from the summit of the Rocky Mountains struck
us, and for hours raged furiously       raw and gusty, piercing
to the bone. But at midnight we rolled into Fort
Morgan, and halting in its hospitable quarters, waited
until the wind blew itself out.

The sunsets now and then were magnificent, and one
particularly beyond Fort Sedgwick or Julesburg deserves
further mention. We were rolling rapidly along, when
the sun went down behind a cloud, that formed the huge
segment of a circle on the horizon, and from around and
behind this his rays came flashing forth with a beauty       a
glory and a gorgeousness       that we had never seen
equalled. Heavy, sombre clouds hung about the west,
while over head and off to the east they thinned out into
fleecy mottled masses almost invisible, until his reflected
rays illuminated them. Up among these, across the
whole dome of the heavens, the colors flamed and went,
as tremulous as a maiden's blushes       now crimson and
gold, then purple and violet, and now again a dreamy,
hazy, half-pink, half rosy light, that baffles description.
I had seen gorgeous sunsets elsewhere       on the Hudson,
among the Alleghanies, by the sea       but never any so[Pg 46]
full of glory and majesty, and sublimity as this. The
fleecy masses overhead seemed to hang in curtains, one
behind the other, like the top scenes at a theatre, and
the shifting light playing about among them added to
the illusion. Nature seemed here to enrobe the heavens
in her most magnificent and gorgeous tapestry, as if
trying to show what glorious fabrics her noiseless looms
could weave; and over all brooded that mysterious
silence of the Plains, that seems like the hush of eternity.
It must have been some such scene, that flamed through
the poet's brain when he wrote:


"All the west was washed with fire;
Great clouds were standing round the setting sun,
Like gaping caves, fantastic pinnacles,
Citadels throbbing in their own fierce light,
Tall spires that came and went like spires of flame,
Cliffs quivering with fire-snow, and peaks
Of piléd gorgeousness, and rocks of fire
A-tilt and poised, bare beaches, crimson seas."


A singular part of it all was, that passengers in the
next stage-coach, a hundred miles east, were struck with
the same magnificent sunset, and followed us into Denver
with similar accounts of its grandeur and sublimity, at
the point where they had been.



[Pg 47]




CHAPTER IV.

UP THE PLATTE TO DENVER (Concluded).


The Platte Valley itself is a great furrow or groove
in the heart of the Plains proper, extending substantially
due west from the Missouri to the Rocky Mountains.
On the line of our tier of northern cities, and so in the
track of northern ideas across the continent, it is as if
nature intended it for a great natural highway, and already
it had come to its fulfilment. Its early selection by our
army of emigrants to Colorado, Utah, California, etc.,
was because of its supplying the three great desiderata of
wood, water and grass, better than any other route; and
its easy grades, as well as accumulating trade and travel,
made it the predestined pathway of the Pacific Railroad.
It varies in breadth from five to ten miles, and is bounded
on either side by abrupt bluffs two or three hundred feet
high, whence outstretch the Plains proper. Extending
from the foot of these bluffs, for a mile or more usually, is
a level plateau or "bench" (in Plains parlance), composed
of sand and gravel, and worthless for agricultural purposes
from want of moisture. To be sure, during the
spring a meagre herbage is sustained here, but long
before summer ends everything green parches and withers
up. Then come the bottoms proper, on either side of
the river, of rich loam and clay, which produce grass in
goodly quantities all summer, and we saw no reason why
they should not also grow most cereals and vegetables.[Pg 48]
Perhaps it is too far north for Indian corn; but wheat,
barley, oats and rye ought to flourish there, except in
localities where the soil may be too strongly impregnated
with alkali or soda. Their natural adaptation, however,
is for grass, and I apprehend we shall soon have our
flocks and herds, by the acre, feeding all up and down
by the Platte. When you reach the North Platte the
valley of course subdivides, and you continue on up the
valley of the South Platte to Denver. The fertile and
cultivable bottoms, of course, narrow as you advance;
nevertheless, they maintain a considerable breadth
nearly everywhere, despite encroaching bluffs, and
around and beyond Denver are made highly productive
by occasional irrigation as needed. Utilize the unfailing
waters of the Platte by windmills or otherwise, as they
do their streams in Italy, Egypt and China, and the
Platte valley throughout its length will yet become a
garden.

The Platte itself to the eye is a broad and lusty
stream, and in places, as near Fort McPherson, expands
into a sea of islands, most refreshing to behold after days
of dusty travel. But while in volume sufficient for a
first-class river, its banks are so shifting and its sand-bars
so numerous and variable, that it has always proved practically
unnavigable, notwithstanding our western rivers
swarm with stern-wheelers, many of which it is said only
require a respectable ditch or half decent dew. Unbridged
and without ferries, we found it crossed only at
a few well-defined fords, and even these were so cursed
by quicksands, that trains in crossing stood in great danger
of bringing up at Jeddo or Pekin. Its waters were considered
healthy and sweet, notwithstanding a trace of alkali,
and with all its shortcomings, it seemed nevertheless a
perfect God-send to that particular region. Its banks and[Pg 49]
islands were usually fringed with cottonwoods and poplars,
and furnished almost the only supply of fuel to passing
emigrants and travellers. The settled residents there,
however, the station-keepers and ranchmen, depended
more on the stunted cedars, that abounded generally in all
the ravines and cañons, with which the side-bluffs of the
valley are more or less seamed. Here also they procured
the most of their lumber, and from here supplied thousands
of ties for the Union Pacific Railroad. We were
surprised to find these cedars so abundant in the cañons,
where nothing tree-like was visible until you entered.
Then we found the whole bottom and sides frequently
lined with them to the top; but there they abruptly
ceased, as if close shaven by the winds, which in certain
months sweep over the Plains mercilessly.

In both wood and lumber, however, we found the
Platte valley sadly lacking, and the whole Plains country
generally. Good peat had been found at Julesburg, and
bituminous coal was reported near Fort Morgan; but
our posts were depending for both fuel and lumber mainly
on the Platte and its side cañons. At Fort Sedgwick,
near Julesburg, they had been hauling wood nearly a
hundred miles, at a cost to the government of over a
hundred dollars per cord, there being none nearer or
cheaper. Lumber cost one hundred and seventeen dollars
per thousand, and shingles fifteen dollars per thousand,
and were held cheap at that. The year before,
lumber had cost two hundred and five dollars per thousand,
and shingles in proportion. Grain (corn and oats) was
wagoned from the Missouri, and cost the government, put
down at Sedgwick, about seven dollars per bushel. Hay
was cut in the vicinity, and cost thirty-four dollars per
ton. Recently they had made a contract with shrewd
operators in Denver, for lumber at ninety dollars per[Pg 50]
thousand, and wood at forty-six dollars per cord, both to
come from the Rocky Mountains, over two hundred miles
away; but the contractors availed themselves of cheap
freights by eastward-bound wagon-trains, otherwise
returning empty. At Julesburg, we were told, there was
not a tree even for fifty miles; formerly there had been a
scrubby cottonwood, on the south bank of the Platte there       a
lone star in solitary splendor       which was regularly
shown to tourists as one of its lions. But this had
recently fallen down and floated away, and now Julesburg
mourned its loss as "the last of the Mohicans." There
was some talk of erecting a monument to its memory;
but even this would have to be of "adobe," as stone was
equally a rarity there.

Down in the valley proper, the field of vision is limited
by the side bluffs, and you see but comparatively
little of the country generally. But ascend the bluffs on
either side, and the vast ocean of the Plains stretches
boundlessly before you       not flat, but billowy with swells
and ridges, an illimitable plateau, with only here and
there a solitary "butte," sharply defined against the clear
sky. In spring this whole vast extent is a wilderness of
verdure and flowers; but the summer skies, untempered
by rain, as elsewhere said, scorch and burn the ground to
cinders, and long before autumn comes all vegetation
there practically perishes. Even the hardy buffalo-grass
becomes brown and tinder-like, and the only grazing there
is in the cañons and valleys. Nevertheless our Plains have
hitherto sustained buffalo by the million, and do it still,
although these shaggy monsters have of late mostly
disappeared from the Platte region. We did not see one
in our entire trip to Denver; but a friend, who came
through a month or so later, over the Smoky Hill route,
where there was less travel, reported buffalo there yet by[Pg 51]
the horizon full       the whole country being substantially
black with them. The short and sweet buffalo-grass is
indigenous through all this region, and is said to be
nutritious, even when dried up, the year round. What a
magnificent range for stock these great Plains will yet
afford, when the country becomes more thickly settled up!
Much of this region is marked on the old maps as the
"Great American Desert;" but from all we saw and
heard I doubt not, as a whole, it will yet become the
great stock-raising and dairy region of the Republic,
whence we shall export beef and mutton, leather and
wool, in exchange for cloth and steel.[3]

We had several fine rides with brother-officers among
the cañons and bluffs while stopping over to inspect our
military posts en route, and a grand gallop one bright
September morning over the Plains and far away after
antelope. In the cañons and along the bluffs we started
plenty of jack-rabbits; but the antelope were shy and
apparently always on the run, so much so we could never
get within shot of them. We formed a long line across
the country, and as we swept forward started two or
three small herds; but they were all too fleet for Uncle
Sam's coursers. Subsequently we halted, and lying
down tried the old hunter's trick of enticing them with
a handkerchief on a ramrod, with our rifles ready to
blaze away as they drew near; but they were too cunning
to be caught by any such rascally flag-of-truce
arrangement, and it seemed a shame to attempt it. The
ride itself, however, was a great satisfaction, full of
excitement, exhilaration, enjoyment. The sky was a
perfect sapphire, without cloud or haze. The clear
atmosphere braced one's nerves like wine, and revealed
distant objects with a pre-Raphaelite distinctness. A[Pg 52]
pyramid-like "butte," off to the southwest, seemed near
at hand, though more than twenty miles away. The
ground was baked hard, with a thin covering of dry-grass,
except in the occasional buffalo-wallows; and altogether
our horses seemed to enjoy the gallop quite as much as
we did ourselves. There was just a spice of danger in
the ride, too, as Indians were reported prowling about, but
none appeared. We left the Platte with its bluffs and
cañons behind us, and out into the boundless Plains we
rode, on and on, and only drew rein when we discovered
that we had lost our reckoning, and were without a compass.
The person charged with providing this had
forgotten it, and suddenly we found ourselves at sea,
without guide or headland. Fortunately we had the
well-worn buffalo-trails, that there run almost due north
and south       the old paths over which they formerly went
to and from the Platte for water       and following up one
of these, after an hour or two, we found ourselves in
sight of the river again. These "trails" are no wider
than ordinary cow-paths, but they are worn deep into the
soil, and show by their great number and depth what
countless herds of buffalo must have roamed here in other
days. They are a sure guide up and down the bluffs,
many of which are so precipitous that safe ascent or
descent elsewhere seems impossible. But the buffalo, by
a wise instinct, seems to have hit just the right point, and
deserves credit for such skillful engineering.

The population of the Platte Valley was yet mostly
in futuro. The little in esse was grouped sparsely
around the several Military posts       Forts Kearney,
McPherson, Sedgwick and Morgan       the intervening
stage-stations, and at Julesburg. The largest hamlet,
perhaps five hundred inhabitants or so, was near Fort
Kearney, having grown up on the outskirts of that post,[Pg 53]
and bearing the same name. Julesburg consisted of a
blacksmith-shop, a grocery, a billiard-saloon, and a half-dozen
houses all of adobe. It was on the South Platte, at
the point of crossing for the Utah and Montana travel,
which here bore away northwest for Bridger's Pass, and
so did a considerable business already in canned-fruits
and tangle-foot whiskey. A year afterwards, it was the
terminus for awhile of the Union Pacific Railroad,
went up speedily to two or three thousand inhabitants,
and figured largely in eastern journals. But, presently,
with the ongoing of the railroad, its importance ceased,
and its inhabitants,


"Folded their tents like the Arabs,
And silently stole away."


The stage-stations usually had a ranch or two adjoining,
though these grew more infrequent, as we got farther
west. These were only rude huts of sod or adobe,
with dirt-roofs, divided into two apartments       one for
sleeping purposes, and the other for a cross-roads grocery.
The stock on hand usually consisted largely of tobacco,
canned-fruits and vegetables, and the worst varieties of
"needle-gun" whiskey, warranted to kill a mile away.
Hay and wood were also kept on hand, for sale to passing
trains, and many ranchmen managed thus to pick up
considerable money in the course of the year. Generally
two men occupied a ranch thus together, though sometimes
squaws were found serving as "brevet"-wives. Much
of their time was spent, especially at night, in playing
"poker," "old-sledge," "seven-up," etc. for the want
of something else to do; and a newspaper, a Congressional
speech, or even a Pub. Doc., was always welcome.
Farther west, the stage-stations and ranch-huts were
built more substantially, and often were regularly[Pg 54]
bastioned and loop-holed for a siege. One of the most
notable of these was Fort Wicked, about half-way between
Julesburg and Denver. It was built of sods and adobe,
with a thick wall of the same on three sides, and was
really an arrow and bullet-proof block-house. A year or
so before, it had been attacked by a party of Cheyennes
and Arrapahoes; but the owner and his men showed
fight       killed several of the red-skins, and put the rest
to flight       whereupon some one christened the place
"Fort Wicked," and the name stuck.


   
   
   PLAINS INDIANS.


Wagon-trains going west or returning east, we met
frequently, but not to the extent we anticipated. They
usually consisted of from ten to twenty wagons each,
with from eight to twelve pairs of mules or yokes of
oxen to each wagon. Going up from the "River," as
the Missouri was always called, these trains being loaded
all had their full complement of wagon-masters, teamsters,
cooks, etc. But, returning empty, several wagons
were often coupled together       the surplus employees stopping
over in the mines. By day, these trains stretched
their huge length along, the great white-sheeted wagons
or "prairie-schooners" carrying each from ten to twelve
thousand pounds; but, at night, their wagons were
formed into a "corral," with the animals inside to prevent
the Indians stampeding them, and the picturesque
effect of such encampments was always pleasing. Even
here on the Plains, about the last place we would suppose,
the inherent aristocracy of human nature cropped
out distinctly. The lords of the lash par excellence were
the stage-drivers. The next most important, the horse
or mule teamsters; and the lowest, the "bull-drivers."
The horse or mule teams made from twelve to fifteen
miles per day; the ox-trains eight to ten. For real
vagabondage, pure and simple, life with one of these[Pg 55]
trains seemed hard to beat. An Arab of the desert, or a
Gaucho of the pampas, could ask for nothing more
nomadic. And if anybody is sick of Sybaris, and anxious
to get away from all trace of civilization, here is the
place for him. It seemed to be going down to the bed-rock
in the social scale, and afforded a splendid opportunity
to study first principles. A school-friend of mine,
a man of fine culture, tried it formerly, and his experiences
were racy and rare. Subsequently, as miner, land
agent, speculator, and lawyer, at Pike's Peak and
Denver, he made two or three fortunes and lost them;
then emigrated to San Francisco, where he made another
as army contractor; and then wisely forsook the fickle
goddess, and settled in New York.

Rumors of impending troubles with the Indians
thickened as we advanced. The settlers and stage-people
said the Indians appeared but little on the road, which was
a sure sign that a storm was brewing. Further they
said the tribes had had a grand pow-wow recently
on the Smoky Hill and the Republican, in which they had
agreed to bury the hatchet and make common cause
against the pale-faces. Subsequently, later in the
autumn, they did attack some stations on the Smoky
Hill route, and a stage or two on the Platte route; but
we reached Denver unmolested. East of Julesburg, at
Baker's ranch, we passed an encampment of Sioux, perhaps
two or three hundred, papooses and all, in cone-shaped
wigwams, evidently the original of our army
"Sibley." While changing horses, we strolled into
several of their wigwams, and found them full of braves,
squat upon their hams, intently engaged in playing cards.
In Indian pantomime, they warmly invited us to participate,
but we were obliged to decline the distinguished
honor. The squaws were mostly at work on moccasins[Pg 56]
or blankets, and their tawny little papooses (stark naked,
except a breech-cloth) were either practising with bows
and arrows, or "lying around loose." The entire party
seemed utterly poverty-stricken, even to their ponies and
dogs, and, generally, about as wretched as human beings
could well be. Their main provisions seemed to be
rusty army-rations, which had recently been issued to
them at one of our neighboring posts, and without these
they would have been practically destitute. Dirty,
squalid, indecent, and half-starving, they seemed but
little removed above the brute creation, and gave a terrible
shock to all preconceived ideas about the "Noble
Red Man," if we had any. They were the first real
savages       pure and simple       we had met, and our poetry
and romance, born of Cooper and Longfellow, shivered
at the spectacle. Some miles farther on, we encountered
two young "bucks," gaily attired in blankets, beads,
feathers, etc., jogging along on their ponies to the camp
at Baker's. They had given a big scare to a poor German
we overtook       a blacksmith, travelling alone from
station to station, in a light two-mule buggy, to shoe the
Company's horses. The appearance of our coach, however,
made him feel his scalp more secure, and falling in
behind he followed us up for miles, singing at the top of
his voice "Annie, dear Annie of the vale!" Our stage
was full inside and out, and we were all well-armed       in
fact, fairly bristled with repeating-rifles and revolvers       and
had we been attacked no doubt would have given a
good account of ourselves. Our experiences up to
Denver, however, inclined us to be somewhat skeptical on
the Indian question, and our subsequent observations did
not greatly change this. The whole region, indeed, seemed
to be over-sensitive on the subject. The air was everywhere
thick with rumors, that one by one disappeared as[Pg 57]
we advanced, and we hardly knew which to wonder at
the more       the veracity or credulity of the Plains. In fact,
that prince of romancers, Baron Munchausen, seemed to
preside over the country, or the people to be his lineal
descendants, almost everywhere.

CHAPTER V.

DENVER AND THE MINES.


We reached Denver Sept. 5th, and remained there
several days. Approaching by the South Platte,
you catch sight of the town a mile or two away, when
crossing a "divide," and are surprised at its size and
importance. Ten years before, there was not an inhabitant
there; but now she claimed seven thousand or more,
and boasted with reason, of two hundred and fifty houses
erected that year. Moreover, the new buildings were
chiefly of brick or stone, while the old ones were log or
frame. At the junction of the South Platte and Cherry
Creek her streets are well-laid out, mostly at right-angles,
and for suburbs she has the boundless Plains. Apparently
on a plateau, she is nevertheless really a mountain
city; for at St. Louis you are only three hundred feet
above the sea, at Omaha nine hundred feet, while at
Denver you have got up imperceptibly to four thousand
feet above the sea, or higher than our average Alleghanies.
Her climate is pure and dry, without rain or frost
for many months in the year       the paradise of consumptives       and
for scenery, she has the ever-glorious Rocky
Mountains. Already she had six churches, two
seminaries, two daily papers, a banking-house with a
business of twelve millions a year, a U. S. Mint, a theatre,
and hotels and saloons unnumbered, though these last it
was thought were diminishing. Until recently, gambling-hells[Pg 59]
had also flourished openly on her streets, with their
usual concomitants of drunkenness and affrays. But
some months before, a Judge Gale       backed by a strong
public opinion       had taken hold of the gamblers, and
squelched them effectually. Like other "peculiar institutions,"
they died hard, raising large sums of money to
prolong their evil life       threatening some men and bribing,
or trying to bribe, others; but Judge Lynch came
to the support of Judge Gale, with the counter-threat of
"a cottonwood limb and a rope," and so gamblers ceased
to rule in Denver. The happy change was freely commented
on, and now that it had come, people wondered
why they had endured the blacklegs so long. Denver
was now evidently aspiring to better things       to "sweeter
manners, purer laws." Her merchants and bankers
were building themselves homes, sending east for their
families, and settling down, as if to stay. Though not
so law-abiding and Sabbath-loving, as our eastern cities,
yet her churches were well-attended; and her Episcopal
Bishop (Randall), we found scouring the country with all
the earnestness and zeal of an old-time missionary, or
Methodist itinerant. Band and gown, stole and chasuble,
and other ritualistic millenary, he affected but little;
but he preached Christ and Him crucified with a tenderness
and power, that touched all hearts, and Colorado
already had come to love and honor him. "Seek ye first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these
things shall be added unto you," was his text for as
sound and appropriate a discourse the Sabbath we were
in Denver, as we had heard in a long while. Every
sentence struck home, like a rapier or a bullet, at some sin
most prevalent in Colorado, and Denver might well
"make a note of it." Subsequently we heard of him in
the mines and among the mountains, preaching in quartz-mills[Pg 60]
and by the roadside       wherever he could gather a
handful of hearers       always engaged in the Master's
work, and always leaving a deep impression behind
him.

Denver, with water and coal both near, yet had neither
water nor gas works then, and scarcely a tree or shrub
growing anywhere. Numerous trees had been planted,
and much shrubbery; but the long and rainless summers
had proven too much for them. The winter before, a
company had been chartered to bring water from the
mountains, for irrigating and other purposes, and they
already had one ditch completed       three or four feet
wide, by one or two deep       and were projecting others.
This one irrigated several farms, turned a grist-mill or
two, and then, with a branch to the fair-grounds, emptied
into the Platte. But Denver must have such ditches, all
around and through her, if she wants trees and shrubbery
and then she may have streets and suburbs unsurpassed
anywhere. Salt Lake, we afterwards found, had
done this; and Denver will, when she has once been
well scourged by fire. Then she was powerless against
the fire-fiend, and a large conflagration well under way
would have swept the town.[4]

Though the largest town in Colorado, and of commanding
influence there, yet Denver we found was not
the capital, but Golden City instead       a hamlet of five
hundred inhabitants or so, fifteen miles farther west, at
the base of the mountains. The Territorial Legislature
convened there every winter, as required by law; but
immediately adjourned to Denver, where all business
was really transacted, and where the governor and
other territorial officers resided, when not absent in the
states, as some often were. In location, Denver itself[Pg 61]
was, no doubt a geographical blunder, as the business of
the country was really among the mines and mountains;
but as gold had been first discovered here, it got the
start, and bade fair to maintain its supremacy. The
sharpest and shrewdest men in Colorado, we found were
all settled here. All enterprises, of much pith and
moment, began and ended here. All capital centred
here. And Denver brains and Denver capital, it was
plain to see, ruled and controlled our whole Rocky
Mountain region, north to Dacotah and south to New
Mexico.

Denver had two real "sensations," while we were
there       one, the alleged usurpation of Gov. Cumming,
the other the arrival of Gen. Sherman. It seemed
there had been a territorial election, for delegate to
Congress, and the returns not being clear, Gov.
Cumming assumed to give the certificate of election to
Hunt, an Andrew Johnson man, rather than to Chilcott,
a radical Republican       notwithstanding the Board of
Canvassers decided otherwise. The governor claimed
that the law and facts were with him, but the Board of
Canvassers protested to the contrary, and popular opinion
seemed to sustain them. There was a breezy time in
Denver for awhile. The papers savagely denounced
the governor's conduct, as an outrage and usurpation,
and fell into a vein of coarse vituperation they seemed
incapable of before. The saloons were filled with
excited crowds at night; knots gathered on the streets
by day; and presently, one morning out came the papers
with the old-time suggestion of "a cottonwood limb and
a rope," if His Excellency did not yield. An explosion
was now hourly expected, but it did not come. Denver
evidently had grown in grace. The mob-spirit of her
early days could not be revived, and all good citizens[Pg 62]
rejoiced to see it. No doubt she liked Judge Lynch
still; but she liked Eastern immigration and English
capital better, and would do nothing to startle either.
The governor wisely appeared in public but little, and
for several nights found it convenient to sleep elsewhere
than at home. Finally, it was given out, that the
military were on his side, as in duty bound, and the
storm presently blew over. Subsequently it appeared,
that said military consisted of only two officers, without
a single soldier; but His Excellency attributed his safety
to them, all the same. General Sherman's arrival immediately
after was just in the nick of time. It followed
on the heels of the election imbroglio, and was a good
salve to the public sore. All Denver turned out to
welcome him and his distinguished brother (the Ohio
Senator), and a cavalcade of horsemen and carriages met
them miles away. Next night there was a reception,
banquet, speeches, ball, etc. and hundreds assembled to
do them honor. There was a lamentable lack of ladies;
but brighter, keener men, you could find nowhere.
What there were of ladies, were intelligent and sprightly,
and all were richly attired and adorned; but Denver
needed more of them. Everybody vied in doing
Sherman honor, as a great soldier who had fought nobly
for the country. They did not know his views yet on
the Indian question, which a few months afterwards
they denounced so severely. By an ambulance tour of
two thousand miles, from post to post, through the heart
of the Indian country, he was trying to study the Indian
question for himself, as the great question of his Military
Division; and yet Denver, fond of contracts, claimed to
understand that questio vexata better than he!

We left Denver one bright September morning for
Central City and the Mines. A stage ran daily, but[Pg 63]
wanting to travel more leisurely we went by ambulance.
Across the Platte, and over the Plains again for fifteen
miles, brought us to the mountains and Golden City, just
within the foothills. Clear Creek dashes through the
"city," a broad swift stream, furnishing fine water-power
for several mills already, with plenty to spare for more.
Coal, iron, lead, copper and kaolin were said to exist in
the mountains adjacent, and this water-power was therefore
justly esteemed very valuable. Four or five miles farther
on, the mountains seem to close up       a solid rampart       before
you; but suddenly the road shifts and at Gate City,
through a narrow rocky cañon you again pass on. The
road here follows up a diminutive mountain stream, crossing
and re-crossing its bed every few yards, and by a
very sinuous course slowly makes its way forward between
abrupt masses of red and purple rock, that everywhere
seemed to block its progress. Farther on, the hills open
out, and wild currant and gooseberry-bushes appear, with
pines and firs here and there       many charred by former
fires. The road gets wilder the farther you proceed, and
the mountain views become more and more superb.
You catch glimpses of the great Snowy Range from time
to time; but after awhile you cross the first range, and
then you have the great white-capped Sierra almost always
before you. Three peaks there are especially superb       Old
Chief, Squaw and Papoose       their white and glittering
summits flashing gloriously in the sunshine. Sometimes
we got long views of the Snowy Range, for miles on
miles; and then again, deep down in some wild gorge, its
rocky sides would suddenly expand, and there would stand
these three grand peaks projected against the clear sky,
framed in like a picture. A right "kingly spirit throned
among the hills," Old Chief seemed to be keeping watch
and ward over these Rocky Mountain fastnesses in solemn[Pg 64]
and solitary grandeur; but the Yankee and the miner
had been too much for him.

We dined en route, getting a good meal for seventy-five
cents, and reached the Conner House at Central
City, about 6 p. m., forty miles from Denver. What a
strange place was this, and how surprising it all seemed!
A busy, active, bustling town, with all the appliances
of eastern civilization, in the very heart of the Rocky
Mountains       our ultima thule but a few years ago! Or,
rather, four towns       Black Hawk, Gregory Gulch, Mountain
City, and Central City       all now grown into one.
It never was any place for a town; but there had to be
one there, and so American genius and pluck went to
work and created it. Imagine a narrow, winding mountain-gorge,
with Clear Creek flashing through it, with
scarcely standing-room on either side for an antelope
even, and you have about all Nature has done for a town-site
there. Yet our miners had stuck mills, and stores,
and saloons, and dwelling-houses, and churches here,
almost everywhere, in the most delightful and picturesque
confusion. Some were astride of Clear Creek, as if
wading up stream. Others were propped up on its edges,
as if about to topple in. Others again were mounted on
lofty stilts, all along the mountain side, as if just ready
to start and walk away. About and through them all,
following the general course of Clear Creek, wound one
long and narrow street       too narrow for side-walks       and
here in this bizarre place, walled in on all sides by the
Rocky Mountains, lived and flourished six thousand souls,
all apparently busy and well-to-do       with banks, schools,
churches, newspapers, telegraphs, theatres, and pretty
much all the institutions and destitutions of modern
society. There only remained one need, a railroad, and
that was already in contemplation, down Clear Creek to[Pg 65]
Golden City, and so away to Denver. This would bring
the ores and coal together at Golden City, for fuel was
becoming scarce among the mines; would save much of
the cost of travel and transportation by the wild mountain
roads; and be a great blessing to the mining regions
every way.[5] After tea, we strolled through the town for
a mile or more, and found the streets full to overflowing.
The theatres were crowded, and the drinking and gambling-saloons
in full blast; yet the streets were comparatively
orderly. The population seemed of a better class
than one would suppose, all things considered. There
were scarcely any women, it is true, and what there were
had better been elsewhere, as a rule; but the men
carried keen, clear-cut, energetic faces, that well explained
the enterprise and elan of this audacious town. Of
foreigners, there were far fewer than one ordinarily meets
east, and the Americans as a rule were athletic and live
men       fit to be the pioneers of empire. The inevitable
African, of course, cropped out here and there; but
usually he had risen from the dignity of a barber or a
bootblack, to be a merchant or a miner. Everybody talked
of "feet," and "claims," and "dust;" and bets were
made, and drinks paid for, in "ounces" and parts of an
ounce, as determined by the universal scales and weights.
Greenbacks were still taken, but they were regarded as
a depreciated currency, unworthy of the Mines and
Mountains.

Indications of mining operations appeared first at
Denver, where gold was first discovered at the junction
of the South Platte and Cherry Creek. But the "diggings,"
or placer mines, here were soon worked out, and
then the miners naturally ascended Cherry Creek to
Clear Creek, and so into the heart of the mountains. All[Pg 66]
along North Clear Creek, you see where the stream has
been turned aside, and its bed "panned" over, and as we
approached Black Hawk we found a few miners still
humbly at work this way. But placer-mining in
Colorado had mostly been abandoned as no longer profitable,
and now the chief labor and capital were applied
to the quartz mines       the parents of the "diggings."
These seemed to occur, more or less, all through the
Rocky Mountains, wherever quartz cropped out; but
the richest of them thus far had been found in the narrow
defile about Central City. The sides of the ranges
there had been "prospected" all over, until they seemed
honey-combed or like pepper-boxes, so ragged and torn
were they with the process. Here and there they were
divided up into infinitesimal lots, rudely enclosed,
embracing a few hundred feet or so, denoting mining
"claims." Many of these had shafts sunk some distance,
with a board up, proclaiming name of mine and the
ownership thereof, but others were without these. The
favorite mine in Colorado just then seemed to be the
Gregory Consolidated, near Central City. We went
down into this some three hundred feet, exploring its
various galleries, and it seemed to be all that was represented.
The gold here was so much diffused through the
quartz as to be imperceptible to the eye, and was further
mingled badly with silver, copper, and sulphur. The
company had erected no mill as yet, but were contenting
themselves with developing the lode, and getting out
"pay-ore." Their plan was to sink the main shaft
straight down on the lode, and every twenty feet or so
follow up the indications by lateral galleries, to see
whether the vein held out or not. So far it was doing
well, and the ore continued of an excellent quality. But
it was so difficult to reduce, there was no mill in Colorado[Pg 67]
that could save a fair proportion of the gold; so
that what ore they cared to work was shipped east, or to
Swansea, Wales, even, for reduction. The superintendent
of the mine was a sturdy young Englishman, once a
humble miner with his pick and candle, but afterwards
sub-superintendent of a great silver mine in Mexico, and
now for two or three years here       a man of rare energy
and intelligence. No wonder the stock of the Gregory
Consolidated was steadily rising, with such a policy and
such a superintendent. Too many of the companies organized
in the east were pursuing just the contrary course.
They were putting up mills at once at great expense,
with steam engines and stamps complete, and then
when they came to sink down upon their veins, lo! they
had no "pay-ore" there, or at least none worth working.
A signal instance of this had occurred a year or two
before. A New York Wall street Company had been
organized, on a broad basis, and with great expectations.
With a West Point ex-army officer superintendent and
plenty of capital, their stock soon went soaring up like a
rocket; but presently it came down again like a stick       a
la their superintendent during the war. He erected a
splendid mill of dressed stone at a cost of thousands of
dollars, and went in wildly for all the latest and most
improved machinery; but when afterwards he came to
test their lode thoroughly, alas! he discovered they had
only a poor sickly trace of ore, that soon "petered out,"
and so that fine company of gold and silver miners
incontinently collapsed       or, as Mr. Mantilini would have
said, "went to the demnition bow-wows!" Machinery
that cost the company thirty-three thousand dollars in
New York, was afterwards sold by the Colorado sheriff
for thirteen hundred dollars, to pay freight bills; and
other property in proportion. Other instances were[Pg 68]
reported to us, but none quite so bad as this. But from
the large number of mills and mines standing idle       fully
fifty per cent., it seemed       we could well believe
that mining machinery could be bought cheaper in Colorado
than New York, and that steam-engines and
boilers were a drug. A foundry-man beyond Golden
City, we were told, found it more profitable to buy up
old machinery and recast it, than to work a rich iron
mine, though the former was scattered through the
mountains and the latter was just at his door.

The trouble with the Colorado ores was, they were
refractory sulphurets, which we had not yet learned how
to reduce at a profit. They assayed very readily two
hundred and even three hundred dollars per ton, or more;
but when you came to mill them out in large quantities,
you were lucky if you got twenty-five or thirty dollars
per ton. The problem Colorado then wanted solved was
how to desulphurize these rich ores of hers at a profit.
Various "processes" were continually being tried at
great expense, but none of them seemed yet to be the
"success" she desired. Stamp-mills, with copper-plate
and quicksilver amalgamators, seemed to be the process
in use generally, though not saving over twenty-five per
cent. of the precious metals usually. Many companies
were using these and saving their "talings," or refuse,
with the expectation of yet realizing goodly sums from
working the "talings" over by some new process by-and-bye.
A "process" just introduced was saving from
twenty-five to fifty per cent. more from these "talings:"
but it was too costly for general use, or, perhaps, to pay.
Individual mine-owners and the lighter companies seemed
mostly to have suspended, or like Mr. Micawber to be
waiting for "something to turn up"       for the strong
companies to go on and find the much coveted "new process,"[Pg 69]
when they would resume operations. Another
trouble evidently was the great number of companies
organized to sell stock east, rather than to mine successfully.
Companies, with a property worth a hundred
thousand dollars, had frequently issued stock for a million,
and of course could not expect to make regular dividends
on such an overplus. On a basis of a hundred thousand
dollars, or real value, with an experienced honest superintendent,
they might have got along well, if content to
creep at first and walk afterwards. But as a rule they
had preferred to "water" their stock, after the most
approved Sangrado method; and the result, after a year
or two's operations, was disappointed stockholders and
the old, old cry of "bogus" and "wild-cat." Many of
the companies, too, were heavily in debt, and what was
called in Colorado parlance "freezing out" was taking
place largely. That is to say, a company gives a mortgage
for say twenty thousand dollars on property worth perhaps
a hundred thousand, or at least represented by that
amount of stock. When due it is not met, the treasury
being empty, and the stockholders discouraged from
want of dividends, or by "bear" reports about the mine;
whereupon the mortgage is foreclosed, and the "bear"
directors buy the property in for a song, thus "freezing
out" the feebler and more timid brethren. This operation
may lack the essential feature of old-fashioned honesty,
but is no doubt a paying one       pecuniarily       for the
new owners, who can now well afford to go bravely on.
"Others may sink; but what's the odds, so we apples
swim!"

No doubt Colorado is rich, immensely rich, in
mineral resources       gold, silver, copper, iron, coal, etc.,       but
she was scarcely making much decided headway as a
mining community, so far as could be seen, in 1866.[Pg 70]
Considerable of her population, indeed, had gone off to
Montana and Idaho, to the reputed rich gold-fields
there, and many of the rest were waiting patiently for
the Pacific Railroad and a market. Great results were
anticipated from the oncoming of the railroad, and it is to
be hoped she has realized them. Her yield of the precious
metals in 1862, it was estimated by good authority,
amounted to ten millions of dollars; but in 1863 it fell
to eight millions, in 1864 to five millions, and in 1865 to
four millions. Ross Browne, in 1866, in his report of Mineral
Resources of the United States, with characteristic
exaggeration, estimated her yield for that year at seventeen
millions; but more accurate observers regarded this as a
California joke, and pronounced his estimate at least four
or five times too high. The large yield in 1862 represented
the maximum from gulch or placer mining, and
the soft outcroppings of the quartz veins. But in 1866
placer mining, as I have said, had mostly ceased,
and our quartz-miners had to go down so deep, and then
got only the hardest and most refractory sulphurets, that
the business greatly languished. Yet, it was plain to be
seen, the gold and the silver were all there, in inexhaustible
quantities, practically speaking; or as Mr. Lincoln
once remarked, in speaking of our western mines, "We
there hold the Treasury of the world!" All Colorado
wanted, as elsewhere said, was the right "process" to
subdue these rebellious sulphurets and compel them to
release their imprisoned deities. Science surely holds the
key somewhere, and waits only the coming man to hand
it over to him. Millions of our countrymen are watching
and praying for him. A half a continent calls for him.
And when this coming man does come, who shall estimate
the untold treasures he will here unlock and outpour
upon the world! He will but have to strike the naked[Pg 71]
rocks, and abundant streams of wealth will gush forth.
He will but have to touch the rugged mountain sides,
and gold and silver by the million will obey his bidding       enough
not only to pay our own National Debt, but the
National Debts of the world. Let Colorado, then, be of
good courage. The Pacific Railroad will cheapen supplies,
and swell the volume of her immigration. The
Yankee hand and brain are busily at work, conning over
her knotty problem; and we may be sure, that the right
hour will bring the necessary man.

From Central City we crossed the range at an altitude
of nine thousand feet above the sea, and thence
descended to Idaho, on South Clear Creek. A fine hotel
here, in good view of the Snowy range, boasted itself
the best in Colorado, and we found none better. Here
also were several fine mineral springs, that bubble up
quite near to each other, and yet are all of different temperatures.
A bath-house had been erected, where you
might take a plunge in hot or cold water, as you chose;
the walks were romantic, with a possibility of deer or bear;
the sights, what with ravine, and ridge, and peak, were
magnificent; and Idaho, already something of a summer
resort, expected yet to become the Saratoga of
Colorado. Up South Clear Creek, above Idaho, were
the new mining districts of Georgetown and Mill City,
then but recently discovered and reputed quite rich;
but we had not time to visit them. Down South Clear
Creek, and thence to Denver, is a wild and surprising
ride of forty-five miles, that well repays you. Much of
the way Clear Creek roars and tumbles by the roadside,
with the rocky walls of its cañon towering far above
you; and when at length you cross the last range and
prepare to descend, you catch a distant view of Denver
and the Plains, that has few if any equals in all that[Pg 72]
region. The sun was fast declining, as we rounded the
last crag or shoulder of the range, and the Plains       outstretched,
illimitable, everlasting       were all before us,
flooded with light as far as the eye could reach, while the
mountains already in shade were everywhere projecting
their lengthening shadows across the foot-hills, like grim
phantoms of the night. A cloudless sky overarched the
whole. Denver gleamed and sparkled in the midst
twenty miles away, the brightest jewel of the Plains;
and beyond, the Platte flashed onward to the east a
thread of silver. It was a superb and glorious scene,
and for an hour afterward, as we descended the range,
we caught here and there exquisite views of it, through
the opening pine and fir trees, that transferred to canvas
would surely have made the fortune of any painter.
With our Pacific Railroad completed, our artists must
take time to study up the Rocky Mountains, with all
their fine effects of light and shade       of wide extent and far
perspective, of clear atmosphere, blue sky, and purple
haze       and then their landscapes may well delight and
charm the world.

Mining is, of course, the chief business of all that
region, from the Missouri to the Mountains, and the
habits and customs of the miner prevail everywhere. He
digs and tunnels pretty much as he wills       under roads,
beneath houses, below towns       and all things, more or
less, are made subservient to his will. His free-and-easy
ways mark social and political life, and his slang       half
Mexican, half miner       is everywhere the language of the
masses. A "square" meal is his usual phrase for a full
or first-rate one. A "shebang" means any structure,
from a hotel to a shanty. An "outfit" is a very general
term, meaning anything you may happen to have, from
a stamp-mill complete to a tooth-pick       a suit of clothes[Pg 73]
or a revolver       a twelve-ox team or a velocipede. A
"divide" means a ridge or water-shed between two
valleys or depressions. A "cañon" is Mexican or Spanish
for a deep defile or gorge in the mountains. A
"ranch," ditto, means a farm, or a sort of half-tavern
and half-farm, as the country needs there. To "vamose
the ranch" means to clear out, to depart, to cut stick, to
absquatulate. A "corral," ditto, means an enclosed
horse or cattle-yard. To "corral" a man or stock,
therefore, means to corner him or it. To go down to
"bed-rock," means the very bottom of things. "Panned-out"
means exhausted, used-up, bankrupt. "Pay-streak"
means a vein of gold or silver quartz, that it will pay to
work. When it ceases to pay, it is said to "peter out."
Said a miner one day at dinner, at a hotel in Central
City, to a traveller from the east, "I say, stranger,"
pointing to a piece of meat by his side, "is there a pay-streak
in that beef thar?" He wanted to know if there
was a piece of it worth eating or not. The short phrase
"You bet!" is pure Californice, and has followed our
miners thence eastward across the continent. We struck
it first on the Missouri, and thence found it used everywhere
and among all classes, to express by different
intonations a great variety of meanings. For example,
meeting a man you remark:

"It is a fine day, my friend!"

He answers promptly and decidedly, "You bet!"

You continue, "It is a great country you have out
here!"

He responds, "You bet ye!" sharp and quick.

"A good many mills standing idle, though!"

"Wa'll, yes, too many of them! You bet!" with a
knowing shake of the head.

"Miners making much now-a-days?"

[Pg 74]

"Oh, yes! Some of us, a heap! You bet!" rather
timid.

"Going back to the states one of these days?"

"When I make my pile! You bet!" firm and
decided.

"Get married then, I suppose?"

"Won't I? Just that! You bet ye!" with his hat
up, his eyes wide open, and his face all aglow with
honest pride and warm memory of "The girl I left
behind me!"

In Central City they told us a story of a miner, who
was awakened one night by a noise at his window, and
found it to be a burglar trying to get in. Slipping
quietly out of bed, he waited patiently by the window
until the sash was well up, and the burglar tolerably in,
when he placed his revolver against the fellow's head,
and sententiously remarked, "Now you git!" The
story ran, the burglar looking quietly up surveyed the
situation, with the cold steel against his brow, and as
sententiously replied, as he backed out and dropped to
the ground, "You bet!"



[Pg 75]




CHAPTER VI.

AMONG THE MOUNTAINS.


The Plains after awhile became somewhat of a bore,
they are so vast and outstretched, and you long for
a change, something to break the monotony. To us
this came one evening, just beyond Fort Morgan, when
a hundred and fifty miles away, just peeping above the
horizon, we descried the cone-like summit of Long's
Peak, all pink and rosy in the sunset. "Driver, isn't
that the Mountains?" said some one. "You bet!"
was his answer, of course. "'Tisn't often you can see
the Peak this fur; but it is mighty clar to-day!" The
night soon afterwards shut down upon us, during which
we bowled rapidly along from station to station, and the
next morning were early awake. Soon the sun rose
bright and clear; but the air was keen, with a stiff
breeze eastward in our teeth. We were down in a wide
depression of the Plains; but presently we rose up out
of it, and as we struck the summit of the "divide," lo,
the Rocky Mountains were before us in all their
grandeur and sublimity. To the north rose Long's Peak,
fourteen thousand feet above the sea, heaven-kissing,
but with his night-cap still on; to the south, was Pike's
Peak, eleven thousand feet above the sea, snow-crowned;
while between, a hundred miles or more, swelled and
towered the Mountains       at the base mere foot-hills, then
ridge mounting on ridge and peak on peak, until over[Pg 76]
and above all the Snowy Range cropped out sublime.
Patches of pines dotted their surface here and there,
but the general effect was that of nakedness and barrenness.
Clouds hung about their summits, or lingered
along their sides; but the uprising sun soon dissipated
these, or sent them careering aloft, as if bound for
heaven. In the course of the morning we whirled into
Denver, and there for a week or more       by sunlight, by
moonlight       the Mountains were ever before us, in all
their thousand varieties of tint and shadow. They
never seemed precisely the same. Some new point
was ever looming up, or flashing out       and yet they
always realized one's best conceptions of beauty, grandeur,
vastness, and sublimity.

Subsequently, accepting an invitation to accompany
Gen. Sherman and Gov. Cumming to Southern Colorado
and an Indian treaty there, we spent nearly a
month among the Rocky Mountains, following down
their eastern base and crossing them to Fort Garland, some
two hundred and fifty miles, and thence returning to
Denver again through the heart of them, via San Luis
Park, Homan's Park, and South Park. This trip we
made by ambulance, camping out at night, and rationing
ourselves, as there were no stages on the route and very
few settlements. Our little party, by the addition of
officers and others at Denver, had swelled to seven,
exclusive of cook and teamsters. Our "outfit" consisted
of two four-horse ambulances and an army-wagon,
with spare animals for saddle or other purposes, as
occasion required. We took a tent along, but seldom
had occasion to use it. We had blankets and buffalo
robes for the night; some stray books and magazines for
the day, when weary of the scenery; pipes and tobacco
for all; and other supplies, it seemed, ad infinitum. In[Pg 77]
the matter of arms, what with our repeating-rifles and
revolvers for Indians, and a brace of fowling-pieces for
game, our ambulances were travelling arsenals. And
from reports on leaving Denver, (Sept. 13th) we did
not know but we should want all, and more. With the
usual exaggeration of the border, the story current
there was, that a Mexican belonging to one of the settlements
down below had quarrelled with a Ute about a
squaw, and wound up by killing him; that the Utes
were consequently up in arms, stealing stock and murdering
the inhabitants; that Fort Garland was already
practically besieged; and that the United States was of
"no account, no how," because we did not send more
troops to Colorado. However, we started for Garland,
well-armed as above; we did not meet a hostile Indian
on the way; and when we arrived there, we found there
hadn't been a settler molested, or mule stolen; and the
whole yarn had come from a Ute found dead, supposed
killed by lightning. When first discovered, near one
of the settlements, the Utes were considerably ruffled;
but when the post-surgeon at Garland and their medicine-man
had examined him and found no marks of
violence, the chiefs laid their heads together and sagely
concluded the Great Spirit had called him.

Our course from Denver was about due South,
following the trend of the mountains, and always near
them. For several days our road was substantially over
Fremont's old trail of 1843, across the high "divide"
between the Platte and Arkansas, and so down the
dashing Fontaine qui Boulli to the Arkansas. This
"divide" bears an unenviable reputation, as a storm-region.
Coloradoans aver, that it rains, hails, snows, or
blows there, when it is fair weather all around it, and we
were warned of it accordingly. It is a high rolling[Pg 78]
region, running well up into the mountains, with Pike's
Peak frowning over it, and I suppose the configuration
of the country is such as to attract and concentrate
storms there. We made haste to get across it, but sure
enough encountered both rain and hail, though we found
the country both north and south of it basking in a
dreamy, autumnal atmosphere, that seemed like the very
wine of life. That night we camped near "Dirty
Woman's Ranch," close into the mountains, and slept
delightfully in a hay-yard. The sun went down in a
cloudless sky, transfiguring the snow-clad summit of
Pike's Peak with a glory all its own, whose pink and
crimson faded into purple, and this again to blue, as the
day died out. So, too, the rest of the range, from purple
and blue, came out sharp and black against the star-thick
sky, and night shut down upon the Plains with scarcely
a sound to break the silence.

During the day, the blank monotony of the Plains
was broken by numerous "buttes," some of which were
very surprising. The chief one, "Castle-Rock," was an
abrupt precipitous mass, well bastioned and castellated,
that rose sheer into the air several hundred feet, as if
the work of hammer and trowel. At a distance, it
seemed almost squarely perpendicular, but two of our
party, who had galloped on ahead, found an accessible
path to the summit on its southeast side. As we drove
up abreast of it, we descried them on its dizzy edge, but
took them to be eagles or buzzards, until they out with
their handkerchiefs and fired off their pistols. The smoke
curled away on the breezy air, but the sound was
inaudible down by the roadside as we drove by. These
"buttes" dot the country over there for miles, standing
solitary and alone       wholly disconnected from each other       and
are a strange feature of the Rocky Mountain
region.

[Pg 79]

The next day we struck Monument Creek and followed
this down to the Fontaine qui Bouilli. Here the
country for miles is marked by great masses of sandstone
and limestone, chiseled by wind and rain into the most
fantastic shapes and forms. Some are slender columns of
gray or red rock, a hundred feet or more in height, worn
and smooth; while others are cut and carved so curiously,
that it seems they must be the deft handiwork of man.
Right under the shadow of Pike's Peak, they seem to
culminate, and here is Colorado's famous Garden of the
Gods. Entering from the roadside we passed through
a little ravine, that rapidly widened into a bijou of a valley,
and there near its centre uprose two tremendous rocks,
red dashed with gray, six hundred feet long by two
hundred high, tapering to a knife-like edge. They were
both inaccessible to man, but the elements had bored a
hole through the summit of one, that looked for all the
world as if a round shot or shell had knocked its way
through there. A score of swallows were twittering about
this, as we passed by, and their nests were visible all up
and down the rocks. A little distance off stood three red
sandstones, ten or twelve feet in diameter, by a hundred
or more high, like the surviving columns of some ruined
temple       one somewhat splintered and shattered, but the
others still uplifting their capitals sublime against the
sky. Farther on the whole country here is studded for
miles, with these wedge-shaped and columnar masses of
red and gray rock, some even on a grander scale, as
though it were a cemetery of Titans, marked by Cyclopean
tombstones. It is a vast meadow, rich with herbage,
with Monument Creek meandering through it, vocal
with the song of birds, the whole lying close up under
the overshadowing Mountains; while over all, breaking
sharp and clear against the faultless sky, stands Pike's[Pg 80]
Peak, imperial in his majesty, dark below with pines and
firs, but his bald head crowned with eternal snows,
looking calmly down, as if God's sentinel keeping watch
and ward over all below. Altogether the grouping of
the landscape there is very fine, as if the gods had done
their best; and on the glorious morning when we saw it,
beneath a perfect September sky, we thought Colorado
had indeed here much to be supremely proud of.

Some three miles farther on, near the banks of the
Fontaine qui Bouilli, which here comes boiling down
from the foot of Pike's Peak, there are several fine natural
soda-springs. They come bubbling up on either side
of the stream from the far depths below, and their overflow
during the long ages has deposited large rocks of
calcareous tufa or carbonate of soda all about them. We
tried this soda-water, and found it as cool, and as sharp
and titillating as that from a city-fountain; and when
treated with an acid, it effervesced and vanished quite as
freely. H               and B               tried it with lemons and
whiskey and reported their cocktails quite unequalled
since leaving New York. Col. Chivington, of Sand Creek
memory, had recently purchased these springs and the
land adjacent for three thousand dollars; but he was now
asking ten thousand, though there had not been a dollar
expended for improvements yet. Combined with Pike's
Peak, the Garden of the Gods, and all the unique and
romantic scenery from there to Denver, as well as the
general Plains and Mountains, the investment did not
seem to be a bad one, and no doubt will pay handsomely
some day. But it was then waiting the completion of
the Pacific Railroad, and the in-pouring of population,
that all Coloradoans then devoutly hoped and prayed for.[6]
[Pg 81]
Just beyond the Soda Springs, stood or rather slept
Colorado City. We had been so unfortunate as to break
our ambulance-tongue in pulling out of a mud-hole, and
halted there to have a new one made. In the days of
1857-60, when mining centred at Pike's Peak, Colorado
City was the Denver of southwestern Colorado, and
must have been a place of considerable importance.
But the "diggings" there long since gave out, and C. C.
was now in a bad way. Corner-lots were for sale, dirt-cheap.
It had plenty of empty shanties, but scarcely
any population; and what it had, were the sleepiest-looking
Coloradoans we had yet seen anywhere. The
"hotel" or tavern, was forlorn and dirty; the people, idle
and listless; and the "City," as a whole, was evidently
hastening fast to the status of Goldsmith's Deserted
Village. Cañon City, farther up in the mountains, they
told us, was even worse off       having no inhabitants at all.
It had good buildings, some even of brick and stone,
equal indeed to any in Colorado; but all stood empty,
like "some banquet-hall deserted," and the once busy
"City" was now as silent as Thebes or Petræ. Such is
life in our mining regions. Population comes and goes,
as restless as the sea, according as the "diggings" promise
good "pay-dirt" or bad. And what are prosperous and
busy centres this year, next year may become empty and
deserted.[7] At sunset we went into camp on the banks
of the Fontaine qui Bouilli, while a snow-squall was
careering around Pike's Peak. Several of these had
been prancing about his summit during the afternoon,
and about five p. m., one of them swept down over the[Pg 82]
foothills and valley, with far out-stretched wings, giving
us a taste of its icy breath as we journeyed by. At sunset
the hues along the mountains and among the snow-peaks
were magnificent and glorious; but the air became
keen and nipping as night fell, and all the evening we
hugged the fire closely. Just before dark, while supper
was cooking, two or three of us tried the Fontaine qui
Bouilli for trout, and caught       not a nibble even!

Soon after leaving Colorado City the mountains trend
away to the southwest, while the road to Fort Garland
continues on down the Fontaine qui Bouilli to the
Arkansas. Fording this at Pueblo, and subsequently its
two affluents, the Greenhorn and the Huerfano, you
again strike the mountains, a hundred miles farther
south, at the foot of Sangre del Christo Pass. The high
ridges or "divides" between all of these streams are
barren and sterile, to an extent little imagined in the
east; but the streams themselves are bordered by broad
valleys, rich and fertile, that as a rule need only irrigation
to produce luxuriantly. In some seasons they do
not require even this, as their proximity to the mountains
affords them rains enough. Still, no farmer is safe
there without his system of acequias or water-ditches, to
irrigate if necessary; and we found these everywhere
constructed, if not in use, where settlements had been
made. In all of these valleys we already had scattered
ranches       some of them very large       and raised wheat,
barley, corn, oats, etc. in considerable quantities. Colorado
had formerly imported all her grain and flour
from the Missouri, at an enormous cost; but latterly she
had drawn large supplies from these fertile valleys, and
in '66 considered herself about self-sustaining. Not
more than one-tenth, or less, of her arable land here,
however, seemed to be under cultivation, and agriculture[Pg 83]
even then was of the rudest and simplest. The
ranchmen were mainly Americans or Germans, but the
labor was all performed by Mexican peons, subjected for
generations to but one remove from slavery. It was the
threshing season, and in many places we saw them treading
out their wheat and barley by mules, with a Greaser
on the back of each, lazily whiffing his cigarrito, while
his donkey dozed around. Elsewhere, their threshing
done, we saw them winnowing their grain by hand, as the
breeze chanced along. We did not see or hear of a
threshing-machine or a fanning-mill in the whole region
there, and doubt if there was one. The Mexicans do
not comprehend these nineteenth century new-fangled
notions, and will have none of them. They prefer by
far their old-time dolce far niente. Festina lente is
their national maxim, and your thorough-bred peon
would choose a broncho rather than a locomotive any
day. And naturally enough, the American settlers here,
we found, were mostly from the south, and during the
war had been none too ardent for the Union.

Most of the farms here were large in size, and in
crossing the Greenhorn we passed through a noble
ranch, twelve miles wide by eighteen long, owned by a
Mr. Zan Hincklin. In '65 he sold his crop of grain for
eighty thousand dollars, and in '66 expected to do even
better. He had on hand a thousand horses, three thousand
head of cattle, and six thousand sheep, all of which
he grazed the year round. He lived very plainly, in a
rude adobe hut, that we should think hardly fit for a
canal-laborer east; but was as hospitable and generous
as a prince. We had scarcely gone into camp, on the
banks of the rippling Greenhorn, before he sent us over
butter, eggs, and vegetables, and bade us welcome to his
heart and home. He acquired his great estate by marrying[Pg 84]
one of the half-breed daughters of the celebrated
John Brent, who used to hunt and trap all through this
region, and who lived so long among the Indians that he
became himself half Red-Skin. He died possessed of vast
tracts of land here, acquired chiefly through trading
with the Indians, but his children it appeared, as a rule,
had turned out poorly. One of his sons had returned to
Indian life, joining a wandering tribe, and others still
hung about the settlements, of small account to anybody.

From the Arkansas, the country gradually but constantly
ascends, until you strike the mountains again at
the foot of Sangre del Christo Pass. Here you follow
up a dashing rivulet, that courses away to the Huerfano,
and advantage is taken of a depression in the main
ridge to cross into San Luis Park. We camped the
night before in a sheltered nook among the foot-hills,
surrounded on three sides by gnarled piñon trees, while
the fourth opened on a little plateau sloping down to a
noisy brook, that afforded water and grass in abundance.
The next morning we breakfasted early, and were off up
the Pass soon after sunrise. The morning air was
nipping, and as we advanced we found the mists rolling
down the mountains, and so off over the Plains eastward.
The teams being a little slow that morning in packing
up and getting off, some of us concluded to walk on;
but we had not proceeded far, before some one suggested
this might be dangerous, as Indians were reported about,
and our arms were all behind in the ambulances.
Halting, therefore, for the rest to come up, two of us
then secured our Spencers and six-shooters, and mounting
one a horse and the other a mule pushed on ahead
again. The ascent, though gentle, we found nevertheless
very constant, and gradually the ambulances dropped
much behind. The road led over a shelving plateau,[Pg 85]
and up a pretty sharp hill, and then plunged by a rapid
descent into a little valley again. Here we met several
men, with a drove of indifferent cattle and sheep, en
route from Culebra to Denver and a market. Climbing
out of this valley, we struck a sharp ascent, that led
southward along and up the ridge, and then turning
west by south struck straight across the summit. As
we raised the summit, a keen, fierce wind met us from
the west, and soon set our teeth to chattering in unison
with it. On the tip-top we found a contractor's train,
en route to Fort Garland with supplies, doubling up
ox-teams and doing its "level best" to forge slowly
ahead. The summit or ridge, the tip-top of the Rocky
Mountains       the very backbone of America here       we
found only a few hundred yards across; and then we
came out on the western slope, with all the glories of
the San Luis Park nestling at our feet, or uprising
gorgeously before us. Below, the Park lay wrapped in
a dreamy haze, with the Sangre del Christo creek flashing
onward through it; above, peak on peak       huge,
snow-white, and sublime       rimmed it round, as with a
crown. Over all, hung one of those blue and faultless
skies, for which the Rocky Mountains are so world-famous,
with the sun sweeping majestically through it,
while God himself seemed ready to speak on every side.
This was to the west. Turning to the east, the view
there seemed, if possible, even more grand and sublime.
Peak and ridge, plateau and foot-hill, stretched away
beneath us; in the distance the brace of Spanish Peaks,
two bold "buttes" passed the day before, shot up
abruptly six thousand feet into the sky, from the dead
level of the Plains around them; while beyond and
around to the dim horizon, east, north, and south, for
hundreds of miles, outstretched the illimitable Plains.[Pg 86]
The elevation of the Pass is given, as about ten thousand
feet above the sea. At our feet, the fog was breaking
up and rolling off eastward in sullen masses, which the
morning sun gilded with glory, or here and there
pierced through and through down to the earth beneath.
Soon it passed away into airy clouds, careering along
the sky, and presently vanished altogether. And then
the Plains! The Plains! How their immense outstretch
absorbed and overwhelmed the eye! It was not
the ocean, but something much grander and vaster, than
even the ocean seems. If you could view the sea from
the same altitude, doubtless the impression would be
much the same. But what is the loftiest mast-head,
compared with the summit of Sangre del Christo? The
grandeur and sublimity of the scene awed one into
silence, as if in the presence of Deity himself, and the
great and holy thoughts of that hour well repaid us for
all our toil and fatigue. Say what we may, there is
something gracious and ennobling in such mountain
scenery, which men can illy dispense with. How it
deepens and widens one's feelings! How it broadens
and uplifts one's thoughts! How it strengthens       emboldens       one's
manhood! What Switzerland is to
Europe, and New England to the Atlantic States, this
and more, the whole Rocky Mountain region will yet
become to America.

Descending the mountains westward, a ride of a mile
or two brought us to a spring, where a Mexican was
taking his noon-day meal of tortillas, while his inevitable
mule was cropping the grass near by. H. dismounted
and scooped up a drink with his hands, Indian
fashion, but I was not yet thirsty enough for that. A
mile or two farther, still descending, brought us to the
head of Sangre del Christo creek, a dashing rivulet fed[Pg 87]
by snow streams, that runs thence to the Rio Grande. A
winding defile or cañon, of steady though not very rapid
descent, affords a bed-way down the Pass and out into
the San Luis Park, and down this the wild little creek
shoots very serpentinely. It crosses the road no less than
twenty-six times in ten miles, and constantly reminds
you of the famous Yankee fence, which was made up of
such crooked rails, that when the pigs crept through it
they never exactly knew whether they were inside or out!
We jogged leisurely down the creek, until we judged we
were some six or seven miles from the summit, and
perhaps half way down the mountain, when we halted
for the teams to come up. The wind blew sharply up the
Pass still, though it was now much after noon, and we
found the shelter of a neighboring ravine very welcome.
Here we unsaddled our animals, and turned them loose
to graze. They fed up and down the ravine, cropping
the rich herbage there, but would never stray over a
hundred yards or so away, when they would turn and graze
back to us again. On such mountain trips saddle-animals
become attached to their riders, and will seldom leave of
their own accord. So, also, they are unerring sentinels,
and always announce the approach of Indians or others
with a neigh or bray. Building a royal fire with the dry
fir-trees there, we next spread our saddle-blankets on the
ground, and then with our saddles under our heads, and
our feet Indian-fashion to the fire, smoked and talked
until the rest arrived. About two p. m. I noticed Kate
(my mule) stop grazing and snuff the air, very inquiringly;
presently, with a whisk of her tail and a salutatory
bray, she darted down the ravine, as if thoroughly satisfied;
and in a minute or two along came the ambulances,
with our friends chilled through, despite their robes and
blankets. All tumbled out to stretch their benumbed[Pg 88]
limbs, and we ate lunch around our impromptu fire
grouped very picturesquely.

Meanwhile about everybody nearly had got "trout
on the brain." We had caught frequent glimpses of
the speckled beauties, as we crossed Sangre del Christo
creek or rode along its banks, and concluded to go into
camp early, so as to try our luck with a fly or two. A
good camping place was found a mile or two farther on,
near the foot of the Pass, and here while supper was preparing,
several of us rigged up our lines and started off.
H. and I were most unfortunate; we whipped the
stream up and down quite a distance, but came back
fishless. H. caught a bite, and I several nibbles, but
neither of us landed a trout. We could see plenty of
them, young dandies, darting about in the black pools,
or, old fogies, floating along by the banks; but they
were Arcadian in their tastes, and disdained the fancy
flies we threw them. Dr. M. and L., however,
had better luck. The spirit of good Isaak Walton
seemed to rest upon and abide with them. They caught
a dozen or more, of handsome mountain trout, weighing
from two to three pounds each, and the next morning
when brought on our rude table for breakfast, hot and
smoking from the fire, nothing could have been more
savory and delicious. Gen. B. and L. turned cooks
for the occasion, and judged by the result Delmonico
might have envied them. Their broiled trout, fresh
from the brook and now piping hot, buttered and steaming,
assailed both eye and palate at once, and we
awarded them the palm, nem. con.

The weather that day, from noon on, had grown
steadily colder, though the sun shone unclouded most of
the time, and before we got our camp well pitched a
snow-squall struck us. The flakes came thick and fast[Pg 89]
for awhile, but presently passed away, though more or
less continued sifting downward until nightfall. Farther
up the Pass, around the crest of the mountains, snow-squalls
marched and countermarched most of the afternoon,
and at sunset the air grew nippingly cold, even
down where we were. We soon pitched our tent, and
built a glorious fire in front of it; but that not sufficing,
supper once over, we carried our sheet-iron cooking-stove
inside, and all huddled about that. When bed-time came,
blankets, buffalo-robes and great-coats were all in demand;
yet in spite of all, we passed a sorry night of it, and morning
dawned at last greatly to our relief.

We reached Fort Garland next day (Sept. 20) about
one, p. m., without meeting a single Indian, either hostile
or friendly. Denver, as before said, had warned us to be
on our guard, and we tried to be; but all reported dangers
vanished as we advanced       Munchausen after Munchausen
exploding in turn. From the Huerfano across
the mountains to Garland, some fifty miles or more, there
was but a single ranch, and scarcely anybody on the road.
A Mexican on foot and another on a donkey were emigrating
to the Huerfano, and at one point we encountered
a whole family similarly engaged. Paterfamilias,
whiffing his cigarito, led a diminutive broncho (Mexican
for jackass) about the size of a spring calf, on which sat
his household gods, to wit, his Señora also smoking,
with a child before and another behind her       all of them
astride. Another broncho of about the same size followed
on behind, loaded down with clothing, bedding, and
various domestic utensils until there was but little to be
seen of him except his legs. What the locomotive is to
the Yankee, and the horse to the borderer, that the
broncho is to the Mexican, and the two seem alike fitted
for each other and inseparable. His patient little beast[Pg 90]
costs but little, and when stopping browses by the wayside
the best it may, while Don Quixote himself sits
basking in the sunshine. The serene and infinite content
of a Mexican peon, as he sits thus wrapped in his
poncho or serape, sucking his everlasting cigarrito, no
American can imagine. His dignity is as perfect as that
of a Castilian; but the stolidity of his brain, who shall
describe?

Some fifteen miles or so from Fort Garland, in the
heart of the San Luis Park, lies San Luis de Culebra, a
hamlet of five or six hundred people, and I believe, the
most considerable "city," there. You strike the Park
proper some distance east of Fort Garland, and from there
to Culebra the country is substantially a dead-level. Culebra
was then a genuine Mexican town without an atom
of the Yankee in or about it, and seemed a thousand years
old, it was so sleepy, though comparatively a new settlement.
Its houses were all one-story adobes, with chimneys
in the corner, in the true Mexican style, and were
all grouped about a central "plaza," of course, or the
town would not be Mexican. All Southern Colorado, it
will be remembered, formerly belonged to New Mexico,
and hence these Mexican settlements here and beyond.
The people raised wheat, barley, and oats to some extent;
but depended on their flocks and herds chiefly for support.
We entered Culebra at dark, amidst a multitudinous
chorus of dogs, and halted at the house of Capt. D.
a bright German, formerly an officer of New Mexican
Volunteers, but who had recently married a Culebra
señorita and settled there. He gave us an excellent supper,
after which we all adjourned to a "baille," or Mexican
Ball, gotten up especially in honor of Gen. Sherman
and Gov. Cumming, but which Sherman was unable to
attend. Several of his staff-officers, however, and the[Pg 91]
governor were present, and these with the rest of us
made up quite a party. These bailles are great institutions
among the New Mexicans, who retain all the old
Spanish fondness for music and dancing, and are ready
for a "baille," any time. The Culebrans had already had
two or three that week, but got up the Sherman-Cumming
one on short notice and in grand style. The only
thing necessary was to engage a room and music, and
send a runner through the village, to announce a baille
was on the tapis, and the whole population       men, women,
children, dogs, and fleas       were sure to be there. At the
primitive hour of eight p. m. the people began to assemble,
and by nine p. m. the baille was in full blast. The
ball-room itself was an adobe building, one-story high,
perhaps fifty feet long by thirty wide, with a dirt floor,
and seats all around. At the farther end was a rude bar,
with a transparency over it, bearing the motto, "Limonade
and Egg-nog," at which each cavalier was
expected to treat his lady from time to time. Near
this was a rough platform for the musicians, who consisted
of three or four violinists, led by an irrepressible
guitarist       blind and quite a character in his way. As
the evening progressed, he worked himself up into an
ecstacy of enthusiasm, and then, with his eyes "in fine
phrensy rolling," improvised words to every piece they
played. He appeared perfectly absorbed and carried away
with playing and singing, and when a dance ended seemed
quite exhausted. No bone-ist, or tambourine-ist, in a
troupe of minstrels east, ever performed with more thorough
and reckless abandon. His head was thrown back;
his eye-balls rolled wildly: his coarse, matted, coal-black
hair swept his shoulders: his long and bony fingers
fairly flew up and down his quivering guitar: while his
shrill, piping, tenor voice rose and fell above the music, in[Pg 92]
thorough unison with the general scene. Later in the
evening, after frequent potations of egg-nog, Don Jesus,
(for that was his name) became immensely funny, and his
gyrations amused us greatly.

With the first sound of the violins, the couples took
the floor, and kept it up vigorously to the "wee sma'
hours." The older people participated less, but young
and old were all there, apparently the whole population,
in their best "bib and tucker." Women came carrying
their infants, and others held the babies while their mothers
danced. The younger people, down to mere boys and
girls, of course, all danced. First came some slow,
stately Spanish dances; but presently they slid into
schottisches and polkas, and performed these with a vigor
worthy of New York or Paris. Many present were
dressed humbly, and but few comparatively were well
dressed; but ornaments abounded, and the baille or
fandango seemed to put all on an equality. Most of our
party selected partners, and soon were lost in the maze and
whirl. True, they could not speak a word of Spanish, nor
their señoritas any English; but that did not matter, as
the Mexicans regard it as a mark of ill-breeding to converse
while dancing. Their manner of saluting each other,
when first they met, was unique and original, to wit:
the sexes poked their heads over each other's shoulders,
and took a good old fashioned hug. Throughout the
evening, of course, there was a total absence of indecorum.
As a whole, they seemed to be honest, simple
folk, who took life as it came, without fret or worriment,
and enjoyed themselves greatly. There was less beauty
among the women, but more intelligence among the men,
than we expected; their hospitality was hearty and
generous       they did their best to give us a pleasant
evening; and altogether the baille at Culebra was an[Pg 93]
event long to be remembered. I left Gov. C. at 11 p. m.,
looking on and enjoying it, and went to sleep on a
good wool bed       the only kind used there       in a comfortable
room, for the first time since leaving Denver.

CHAPTER VII.

AMONG THE MOUNTAINS (Continued).


Returning next day from Culebra to Fort Garland,
we proceeded thence subsequently up the
Park to the Indian treaty on the Rio Grande; and from
there via Homan's Park and Poncho Pass north to Fair
Play in South Park. These "parks," so called, are a
peculiar feature of the Rocky Mountains and play an
important part in the scenery. There are five of them       North,
Middle, South, Homan's, and San Luis       of
which we passed through the last three. They constitute
in reality a great system of plateaus or valleys,
morticed as it were into the very heart of the mountains,
from twenty-five to fifty miles long by half as many wide,
disconnected by intervening ranges, yet all alike in their
general features. One of the main ranges of the Rocky
Mountains bounds them on the east; but the main range,
the real Sierra Nevada or Mother Range       the great
Snowy Range or real water-shed of the continent, dividing
the waters of the Pacific from those of the Atlantic       runs
along the west. True, this is disputed by enthusiastic
Coloradoans; but the facts seem nevertheless, as
above. The North Platte, South Platte, Arkansas, and
Rio Grande, all take their rise there, and piercing the
eastern range flow thence to the Atlantic or the Gulf,
while no considerable stream flows thence to the Pacific.
Kit Carson, whom we met at Fort Garland, the best[Pg 95]
geographer of that region, took this view of the subject,
and I humbly concur.

The largest of these Parks, by far, is the San Luis,
and we found it fairly gridironed with trout streams, and
rimmed around with mountains. Its general elevation is
from six to seven thousand feet above the sea, with its
surrounding peaks and ridges about as much more, which
is too cold for Indian corn, though the other cereals       such
as wheat, barley, oats, etc.       may readily be grown
there. Volcanic agencies have had much to do with its
formation, as its wide-spread igneous rocks and pebbles
still plainly show. Along the Rio Grande and its numerous
affluents wide bottoms have been formed, that are
very rich       the very washings of the mountains; but elsewhere
you have only rocks and gravel, sage-brush and
grease-wood. It contains no timber, except a fringe of
cottonwoods and poplars along most of the larger
streams; but cedar, pine, and fir are found in the neighboring
cañons and mountains. Cattle and other live-stock
find good grazing in summer along the streams,
and in winter they were said to thrive well on the
coarse bunch-grass, with which the surrounding cañons
all abound. The broad bottoms of the Rio Grande, waving
with tall grass and fatter than the prairies of Illinois,
ought to make magnificent meadows, and will some day
when more of our Anglo-Saxon population overflows
there. The population of the Park was grouped mainly in
two or three Mexican hamlets, and was computed by Kit
Carson (then Colonel of New Mexico Volunteers and
Post Commandant at Fort Garland) at about five or six
thousand only. A noted citizen of Denver, who owned
a large part of the Park, had reported it to us as about
twenty thousand. Not that he intended to be inexact;
but his imagination was naturally very vivid, and his language[Pg 96]
apt to be poetic. In purchasing property there,
under an old Spanish grant, he certainly acquired any
quantity of magnificent mountain, and a wide stretch of
plain; but we suspected, he would wait some time before
he saw his money back again.

Our general ride up the San Luis Park, and so
through Homan's to Poncho Pass, was unique and perfect
in its way. Our route on leaving Fort Garland was first
across several mountain brooks, where the trout were so
abundant, that the soldiers at the fort caught them with
blankets and feasted on them at will, and then directly
up the Park, with the Sierra Blanca or Snowy Range
towering on our right. Striking the Rio Grande, we
found it alive with geese and ducks, and when we
went into camp, L.       our champion sportsman       caught
several noble trout, weighing from five to six
pounds each. Singularly enough, the streams flowing to
the Rio Grande all abound in trout, while those going to
the Mississippi, we were told, all lack them. We halted
two days here, attending the Indian Treaty before alluded
to, and then proceeded on. At Fort Garland, we were
advised to return to Denver by the same route we had
come, as the season was already advancing and nobody
had come through by Poncho Pass since the previous
spring. Moreover, the trail was reported impracticable for
ambulances, and even Kit Carson shook his head, unless
we went by pack-mules. But as the pack-mules were
not to be had, and we were all averse to returning over
the old route, we resolved to push ahead by Poncho
Pass, and get through the mountains that way, if possible.
From the Treaty-Ground, our route lay nearly due
north, with the snowy crest and peaks of the Sierra Blanca
on our right and about parallel. Bidding our friends
good-bye, we set out early (Sept. 24), with the wind dead-ahead[Pg 97]
and bitter cold. Toward noon, the weather moderated
somewhat; but snow-squalls chased each other along
the mountains all day, and once we counted nine in view       one
careering along behind the other       at the same time.
Now and then one would expand its wings, and sweep
across the Park; and several times in the course of the
day we were thus in the midst of real winter. The range
to the west was more or less broken into foot-hills and
ridges; but the Sierra Blanca to the right seemed a solid
rampart, rugged, inaccessible, sublime. Its serrated crest,
white with perpetual snow, rose five or six thousand feet
above the level of the Park; its tree-line was distinctly
marked, as with a rule; and the whole seemed so near
and so gorgeous, when the sunset swallowed up the snow-squalls,
that we could scarcely realize it was yet miles
away. As we got farther up the Park, the soil grew
thinner, and more volcanic in its origin; but we crossed
several handsome streams, that might be made to irrigate
considerable land there.

We found only one ranch, however, north of Fort
Garland       a Mr. Russell's, at the extreme north-eastern
end of the Park. We camped there one night, and
found the proprietor to be a good specimen of the average
Coloradoan. Born in Illinois and bred a blacksmith, the
gold-fever had taken him to California, where he worked
partly in the mines and partly at his trade. When he
failed in the mines, as he usually did, he again resorted
to his trade; and had he stuck to his anvil, he verily
believed, he would have been well-off long before. But
as soon as he had hammered out a little money, his evil
genius led him back to the "diggings;" and so he had
wandered all up and down our mining regions       California,
Nevada, Colorado, etc.,       until 1861, when he found
himself in Denver, without a cent in his pockets. Mining[Pg 98]
happened to be dull there, a regiment of volunteers was
then forming for service against the Indians, and so he
turned soldier. Before his three years were up, he had
saved a moderate "pile," and when he was finally
mustered out and discharged, he came here and
"squatted" on a quarter-section. The money saved
while thus soldiering started him in farming, and he now
thought his future secure. This was his first year there,
but he had got along very well so far. The Indians had
not disturbed him, though frequently there, and his
Mexican peons had proved faithful laborers, though a
little slow. He had raised fine crops of oats, barley, and
potatoes, which he would sell to the garrison at Garland
at good prices; but his wheat was a failure       he feared,
for want of sufficient warmth. He had a good adobe
house, which he meant to enlarge and improve, and a
fine flock of sheep, besides considerable cattle. The
worst feature of his ranch was, that he had to irrigate;
but he said he had plenty of water for this, and the cost
was small. His nearest neighbor was eighteen miles off,
and that was too near; his post-office, sixty miles; and
church, two hundred. It is strange, that men can be
content to bury themselves thus, in the heart of a wilderness,
when God and nature are so bountiful elsewhere.
It is the everlasting itching, I suppose, that we Americans
have for change, which comes to little good after
all. No doubt plenty of Coloradoans would emigrate to
the moon, or even to Le Verrier, if there were a practicable
"trail" there.

The next day crossing a low ridge, through a forest
of gnarled cedars, we entered Homan's Park, and found
it to be nearly a duplicate of the San Luis, on a smaller
scale. It is about thirty miles long, by perhaps half as
many wide, and its essential features are about the same[Pg 99]
as those of the San Luis, though its soil seemed deeper
and more generous. About half way up, a lusty mountain-stream
crosses from west to east, lined with cottonwoods,
and here four Germans had each "pre-empted"
a quarter-section, all lying together. They had all been
officers of Colorado Volunteers, and when mustered out
came and "squatted" here together, in this picturesque
little valley. The last year of their service, being
stationed at Fort Garland, they had been up that way
on a scout after Indians; and, falling in love with the
Park, selected it for their future homes. One of them
was married, and his wife       a tidy young German woman       kept
house for all. They began operations the previous
year, and already had accomplished large results.
They put in seven thousand dollars as joint-capital, and
with this purchased all the necessary animals, implements,
provisions, seeds etc., to start well with. Among the
rest, they bought a hundred and forty cows, which the
following spring brought them in nearly as many calves,
all of which they were now raising. Pasturage was
abundant in summer, and in the winter the adjoining
cañons supplied bunch-grass, etc. They milked all their
cows, and converted the milk into butter and cheese,
which two items alone had paid their current expenses
so far, with a small margin over. A sluice-way from the
brook carried the water into their milk-house, where
instead of tin or earthen pans, they had long milk-troughs
hollowed out of logs, around which the water flowed,
and then passed back into the stream again. A bowl of
buttermilk, that they tendered us, fresh from the churn,
was an unlooked-for luxury in the heart of the Rocky
Mountains, that none of us could refuse. The ensuing
winter they proposed to build a water-churn, and so
make their friendly brook serve them still further.[Pg 100]
They had had tolerable crops of barley, oats, and
potatoes, all of which that could be spared they were
husbanding for seed the coming year. They had tried
some corn and wheat, but neither had matured well, and
they would hardly venture them again. Their butter
and cheese they sold to the miners over in South Park,
and some they sent even to Denver and a market. They
called their place Kerber's Ranch, after their leading
partner, who seemed to be a live Dutchman all over.
Of course, we had to stop to dinner, though it was not
yet noon; and when that meal was announced, they
conducted us to a table Denver might have envied.
Trout, venison, grouse, krout, with all the vegetables of
the season, and lager-beer home-brewed, made up a
meal not to be despised anywhere, least of all in the
fastnesses of the Rocky Mountains. They had seen no
officers and hardly any body else, for months, and would
take no pay for anything; but gratefully accepted an
armful of "literature," as we bade them good-bye       the
last of our newspapers, magazines, and books still left
from our supply on leaving Denver. Their nearest
neighbor was eighteen miles off, and nearest post-office
seventy-five. To Denver was a hundred and fifty miles,
and it took a team a month or more to go there and
return via Poncho Pass. They pronounced the Pass, in
response to our eager inquiries, entirely practicable, with
careful driving, if we crossed by daylight; and with their
kindest wishes, we went on our way rejoicing.

Some miles after leaving Kerber's, we began to ascend
the mountain, but the ascent was so gradual you scarcely
noticed it. There was no well-defined road any where       only
an old Indian trail for saddle and pack animals,
along which only a few wagons had ever passed before.
We continued to ascend until dusk, hoping to reach and[Pg 101]
cross the summit before going into camp; but after sunset,
the trail became so faint and our animals so leg-weary,
we were compelled to halt at the first wood and water
we came to. This we did on the bank of a beautiful
stream, that washed the base of a high bluff or rather
"butte," and rushed thence via Homan's Park to the
Rio Grande. Several of us had rode on ahead on horseback,
but the teams did not get up until after dark.
Meanwhile, we had gathered wood, and built a roaring
fire; and when the rest arrived, we soon had camp pitched,
and the coffee boiling. We had shot some ducks on the
Rio Grande, and brought along some excellent beef-steaks;
and these H. and L. now broiled before the fire, on sharpened
sticks, in a style the Parker House could hardly
have beaten. We found excellent grass here, although
so far up the Pass, and our poor tired animals cropped it
eagerly. The moon was at the full that night, and the
sky cloudless; but before morning the air grew bitter
cold. We shivered through the night, in spite of our
blankets and buffalo-robes; and the next morning at
breakfast, the ice formed in our tin-cups between the
intervals of eating and drinking. We were camped, in
fact, on the summit of the Rocky Mountains, at a height
of nine or ten thousand feet above the sea, with snow-peaks
all about us, and the only wonder is that we got
through the night so well. For the first time since leaving
Denver, we felt a sense of loneliness and danger;
and the occasional yelping of the wolves around us, in
the still midnight air, did little to allay this. Our animals,
also, seemed fretful and uneasy, and we suspected
Indians about, but nothing came of it. We looked well
to our arms before retiring, and talked much of the night
away       it was so cold; and the next morning broke camp
early, and were off up the Pass again.

[Pg 102]

A half an hour's ride or so brought us to the summit,
which surprised us, as the ascent had been so gentle all
the way up from Kerber's       far less than that of Sangre
del Christo from Fort Garland. The view from the summit
we found limited, compared with that from Sangre
del Christo; and soon after we descended into a sheltered
nook knee deep in grass, with wood and water both just
at hand, where we had been advised to camp the night
before, if able to reach it. Following the banks of a diminutive
brook, we descended gradually to Poncho Creek;
and here our really bad road began. So far, the Pass
had been excellent, all things considered, and we were
astonished at its bad reputation; but after we crossed
Poncho Creek, and got started down its wild cañon, we
soon found ample cause for it all. A narrow defile, with
precipitous banks on either side from five hundred to a
thousand feet high, furnished the only road-way, which
here found room first on one side of the creek and then
on the other, the best it could, and in many places it had
to take to the bed of the creek itself, in order to round
the rocky bluffs. The trouble with the Pass was, it had
had no work done on it, and needed grading badly at
several points. A few hundred dollars judiciously
expended would have made it much superior to Sangre
del Christo, we all thought. It is not so high by a thousand
feet or more, nor nearly so steep, and we judged it
would yet become one of the favorite routes to and from
San Luis Park.

While the teams were working through, L. and I
passed on ahead, with our rifles at our saddle-bows,
hoping to start a bear or shoot a buck-tail deer, but saw no
game of any kind. Our experience among the mountains
on this trip, indeed, was unfavorable to the stirring
accounts we had heard and read of great game there.[Pg 103]
The lack of trees there, except in the cañons, and
especially of nut-bearing trees, and likewise of fruit-bearing
bushes, must be unfavorable to animal life, as a
rule, and I doubt if there ever was much there, except an
occasional deer or bear, eagle or buzzard. We were surprised
to find so few birds, and scarcely any squirrels,
except a little red species no bigger than our ground-squirrels
east. We met two of Kerber's teams toiling wearily
up the Pass, as we descended it, and gave them the first
news they had had from the ranch in weeks. We
got several miles ahead, before we knew it, and did not
halt until we reached the foot of the Pass, where it
debouches into the valley of the Little Arkansas. It was
an hour or more before the ambulances overtook us, and
then we received a rough account of their experiences.
In several places, they had had to lash ropes around them
and edge them along the hillsides the best they could.
In others, they would have upset repeatedly, but
managed by walking and pushing to keep them on their
wheels, and finally got through safe and sound. The
wagon, however, being heavier and clumsier, had capsized
badly, and they had driven ahead and left it, with
instructions to follow on as soon as possible. Crossing
the valley of the little Arkansas and a high range beyond,
late in the afternoon we descended into the valley of
the Arkansas proper, and at sunset went into camp on its
banks, near Schwander's ranch. The Arkansas, we found,
was here already a very considerable stream, but we
forded it without difficulty. Our unfortunate wagon,
perhaps it should be added, got along after dark, much
the worse for wear; and jaded and weary with the day's
journey, we were glad to pass a quiet night of it.

The next morning we crossed another lofty range, the
ascent of which was wild and picturesque, and thence[Pg 104]
descended into South Park. Less in size than the San
Luis, and more broken in surface, the South Park nevertheless
has the same general characteristics, though more
nearly circular. Its enclosing mountains are abrupt and
bold, and the views from many points are very striking
and charming. Passing out of it to Denver, we ascended
the range from which Leutze is said to have conceived
his well-known painting in the Capitol at Washington,
"Westward the star of Empire takes its way." The facts
are little like the painting aforesaid, because no emigrant
train would ever attempt to pass over such an impossible
road, as Leutze has painted: but the landscape from the
point referred to is nevertheless noble and grand. The
range there, I believe, is about eight thousand feet above
the sea. South Park, at your feet, extends say, thirty
miles north and south, by twenty east and west; down
in its bosom nestles a necklace of exquisite little lakes,
with streams flashing onward from the mountains to
them; while beyond       all along the west, in fact       runs
the perpetual Snowy Range, notched and peaked, clear
cut and beautiful against the sky, though not so
grand and stately as we had seen it farther south. To the
north of the road the range shoots up nearly a thousand
feet higher, but the view from there did not compensate
us for our toil in ascending it. The whole view here,
though fine in its way, lacks breadth and sublimity, as
a specimen of Rocky Mountain scenery, and Leutze would
have done better (in my judgment) had he gone to Sangre
del Christo or perhaps Poncho Pass. The sky and general
coloring of his painting are good; but how inadequately,
how feebly they express the exquisite serenity
and unapproachable glory of the Mountains! Bierstadt's
skies, though thought impossible east, are nearer to the[Pg 105]
truth, as our critics will yet learn, when they come to
know more of Colorado.


   
   
   TWIN LAKES (South Park).


In South Park, we had struck a new civilization, the
evidences of which grew constantly more apparent. The
Mexican and the herder had given way to the Yankee and
the miner, and the contrast was most striking. Ranches
and settlements were more numerous, and the spirit of enterprise
was everywhere observable. First we struck some
saline springs, where extensive salt-works had already
been erected, and they were reported to be paying well.
They were said to furnish a superior article of salt, at a
less price than it could be imported from the east, and the
company expected thus to monopolize the salt-market
of Colorado and the adjoining regions. Beyond these,
ranches thickened up all the way to Fair Play, and we
found some splendid duck-shooting in the marshes, that
now and then skirted the road. Some of the flocks,
however, carried off an immense amount of lead, or else H.
and L. were indifferent shots       we were never quite able to
decide which. They were our champion sportsmen, and
though they bagged a number of fine ducks en route,
they never were entirely satisfied. They both fired
simultaneously at a great flock that rose up as we drove
by, and when none dropped H. protested, "I know I hit
a dozen that time, but these confounded Rocky Mountain
ducks don't know what shot is. They fly away with
enough honest lead in them to kill an ordinary eastern
duck twice over." L. of course, confirmed this, and
adduced the abundant feathers as proof of their joint
achievement. B. suggested that the Indians had charmed
their fowling-pieces, and meekly inquired of H., "Didn't
the ducks carry off your shot-pouch also?" At Fair
Play, in the northwest corner of the Park, we found a
mining town of four or five hundred inhabitants, apparently[Pg 106]
busy and prosperous. Timber grew plentifully in
the neighboring cañons, and now adobe huts gave place
to frame and log shanties. The South Platte skirts the
town, and is already a considerable stream here, although
it cannot be far away from its source. At Fair Play it
heads north up into the great Snowy Range, or water shed
of the continent, which feeds it perpetually, and runs
thence east to join the North Platte near Fort McPherson,
where we had struck it by stage-coach a month
before. Good "gold diggings" had been found here long
before, and its entire banks about Fair Play have been
dug over, "panned out," and ransacked generally. They
presented a torn and ragged appearance, as if a
young earthquake or two had recently broken out there,
and this was not materially improved by the long and
high flumes then going up. When these were completed,
they expected to turn the Platte considerably
aside, and to find rich "placer mines" in its sand-bars
and bed again. The principal mining then in South
Park, however, was farther up the Platte, at Empire,
Buckskin Joe, and other euphoniously named places,
none of which had we time to visit. The business generally
seemed to be settling down to quartz-mining, as at
Black-Hawk and Central City, and to be passing more
and more into the hands of Companies. We met
several huge boilers on the road, en route to various mills,
and it seemed marvellous how they could ever wagon
them so far across the Plains, and up into the very heart
of the Mountains. Progress with them must have been
slow and tedious anywhere; but when they struck a
slough, or reached the mountain ranges, then came the
whacks and oaths.

Judge Costello, of the Fair Play House, entertained
us while there, and gave us excellent accommodations.[Pg 107]
There had been several inches of snow at Fair Play a few
days before, and arriving just at nightfall after a long
day's drive, we felt the cold very keenly. But the Judge
soon had a roaring fire blazing on his hearth, and welcomed
us to Fair Play right royally. In due time he
gave us a substantial dinner, piping hot       roast-beef,
chicken-fricasee, potatoes with their jackets on, dried-apple-pie
and coffee       a meal that seemed supremely
Sybaritic, after "roughing it" by the roadside for over a
fortnight. We did ample justice to it, having breakfasted
nearly twelve hours before, and then adjourned to a
common bed-room, where we smoked and read the papers
until midnight. We had seen none since leaving Denver,
nearly a month before; but Judge C. happened to
have just received a large supply, which we devoured
eagerly. The elections in California and Oregon had
just been held, and the North was again rocking with
enthusiasm. Andrew Johnson's apostacy, it was clear,
promised to be a losing game after all. The spirit of a
few people at last was aroused, as after the firing on
Sumter, and evidently the nation meant again neither
to be bribed nor scared. True, the November elections
were yet to come; but we took increased faith in the
virtue and intelligence of the masses, and rejoiced that
Congress was still true to Liberty. Absence from "the
states" is a great purifier of one's political ideas. We see
things at home clearer, and reverence the Union more,
the farther we get away from New York and Washington.
We forgot all the wretched hair-splitting east, by one
side or the other; and came to love only the old flag, in
its highest and best significance, as the symbol of freedom
and justice, for each and for all men, the broad
continent across and the wide world over.

The next morning, a young miner invited us out to[Pg 108]
take a look at a fine specimen of the American black-eagle,
which he had caught a few days before, while
"prospecting" along the Snowy Range. He was comparatively
a young bird still, yet measured some six feet
from tip to tip of wings, and was as brave and fierce as a
tiger. He was kept chained by the leg in a dark stable;
but he was as wide awake as he could be, and screamed
and flew savagely at every one who came near him. It
was intended to forward him to the great Fair soon to be
held at St. Louis, as a specimen of the feathered tribe
from Colorado, where no doubt he created a sensation.
His eyes were bright and keen as a falchion, and his
talons ugly looking grappling-irons. So, too, his legs
were massive, compact columns, that seemed made for
strength and endurance. And altogether he was not a
bad representative of the Rocky Mountains, where his
species have their birth-place and home.

From Fair Play we descended the South Platte direct
to Denver, following the course of the river wherever
practicable. In some places, its narrow and precipitous
cañons prevented this, but we always returned to its
banks again as soon as possible. Some miles from Fair
Play, we passed several gems of lakes, which H. declared
to be "the natural home of the wild-duck;" but though
the ducks were there, he failed to bag any, greatly to his
disgust. L. more fortunate, got one, and killed several
others, but failed to reach them because of the marshes.
Our road led over several ranges, some of them quite precipitous,
but in the main followed the windings of the
Platte, as before said. Here and there the wild cañons,
through which the Platte sped like an arrow, became
picturesque in the extreme. Frequently our course ahead
seemed barred by impenetrable fastnesses, yet somehow
we always got through. High and rocky cliffs towered[Pg 109]
all about us, and all up and down these, wherever they
could secure a foothold, the fir, pine, maple, ash, etc. grew
densely. As we neared Denver, ranches became more
frequent, and saw-mills multiplied, the lumber from
which was shipped far and near, among the mines and
across the Plains, even to Julesburg and Fort Riley. The
road in the main was a natural way; but here and there it
had been blasted out of the bluff, or built up on the
edge of the Platte, at large expense, and I believe is a
chartered turnpike from Fair Play down. The Platte
alone makes such a road practicable, and South Park and
all its dependencies would be virtually inaccessible, were it
not for this great natural highway into the very heart of
the Mountains. Altogether, it is a remarkably good road,
all things considered, and so are the majority of the roads
there. As a rule, they follow the streams that seem to lead
almost everywhere among the ranges, as if purposely
chiseled out from the beginning, as future pathways of
civilization. Our miners, taking the hint, carry their roads
over heights, and through depths, and among peaks, that
would appal most eastern engineers, and thus enable us
to conquer nature in her mightiest strongholds.

The last day out from Denver, we ascended Bradford's
Hill       our last serious climb       about noon. This is in
reality the first range of the mountains, and gets itself
up to some 8,000 feet above the sea; but is yet termed a
"Hill," in Colorado parlance. We all got out or dismounted
and walked up, to relieve our worn animals, and
became well blown ourselves before reaching the summit       the
atmosphere grew so rare. As we rounded its western
shoulder, we caught a grand view of the Snowy Range
again, solemn and sublime over and above all intervening
peaks and ridges; but with one accord, all hastened forward
to behold once more the Plains, the Plains! Yes,[Pg 110]
there they were, in all their immeasurable extent! We
were out of the Mountains       our long jaunt almost over.
No more cañons. No more forests. No more snow-squalls.
No more rides, hour by hour, through narrow
valleys and defiles, where the whole man feels "cabined,
cribbed, confined." No. There were the Plains, illimitable,
grand, in all their immensity and sublimity. We
thought the view from Sangre del Christo fine, and so it
is; but as a view of the Plains proper, without the Mountains
thrown in, this view from Bradford's Hill, I think,
perhaps surpasses it. There is no end to the vast outstretch
and outlook, and in the serene atmosphere of that region
the eye ranges over it all with an ease and freedom, only
equalled by the eagle himself when poised in mid air.
To say that the Plains are visible for miles on miles       north,
south, east       is but a feeble description of the
wonderful panorama, that there unfolds before you. To
the south appeared Castle Rock and its sister buttes, that
we had passed three weeks before, looking now like mole-hills
beneath us. Issuing from the Mountains at our feet,
we could trace the South Platte and Cherry Creek to
where they unite near Denver, and then follow the Platte
on and on to the east, till lost in the far horizon. Denver
lay like a toy-city, seemingly at the base of the Mountains,
though really twenty miles away. Over all, was one of
those perfect days,


"So cool, so calm, so bright,
The bridal of the earth and sky."


as old George Herbert wrote, which no Bostonian or
Gothamite ever truly witnesses       with not a cloud or haze
even visible, the air so pure it was joy to breathe it and
ecstacy to gaze abroad through it. Verily, here in
Colorado, if anywhere.

[Pg 111]


"The sky is a drinking cup,
That was overturned of old,
And it pours into the eyes of men
Its wine of airy gold;
We drink that wine all day
Till the last drop is drained up,
And are lighted off to bed,
By the jewels in the cup."


Off to the southwest, just shouldering over the range,
presently a white cloud loomed up, no bigger than a
man's hand; but the dry atmosphere east was too much
for it, and it faded away as fast as it toppled over. As
we stood gazing at the immensity before us, some one
incidentally said, "I think I now understand how Bilboa
felt, when from the summit of the Andes he beheld the
Pacific;" and it is a good illustration of the identity of
thought under like circumstances, that half-a-dozen others
quickly responded, "You bet! Just thinking of the
same thing!"

We reached Denver the same evening, jaded and
travel-stained, but full of enthusiasm over our trip among
the mountains. We had traversed nine counties, some
as large as a moderate state east, and been absent nearly a
month in all. We had been reported captured and slain
by the Indians, as much as two or three times, but from
first to last did not see a hostile aborigine. We drove
the same animals down and back, over five hundred
miles continuously, without the loss of a mule, and seldom
made less than thirty or forty miles a day, when on
the road. Our ambulances proved very convenient and
serviceable, but in crossing the ranges or in bad cañons I
always preferred a mule. My favorite was Kate, a
noble jenny, as large as a horse and a splendid walker,
that carried me over many a mile delightfully. She was
as gentle as a kitten, and as faithful as a dog       it sometimes[Pg 112]
seemed almost as knowing as a man       obeying
every whim of her rider, and following him everywhere.
If any mule ever attains immortality and a sort of heaven
hereafter, surely Kate deserves to. In crossing the
ranges or threading the cañons thus, on horse or mule
back, several of us would often get miles ahead, and the
time thus gained afforded ample leisure for observation
and reflection. We were seldom at a loss for conversation,
there was so much to investigate and discuss; but
when all else failed, we amused ourselves by organizing
(on paper) two monster Mining Companies, with fabulous
capitals, in which we divided off and took stock. I believe
I belonged to the Grand Sangre del Christo Rocky Mountain
Mutual Benefit Gold and Silver Mining Association;
capital, $20,000,000! H. and C. and others constituted
a rival company, with like assets and name equally
pretentious. We set up these financial fictions early in
the trip, when somebody fell to talking about "feet;"
and what with selling "short," operating for a "rise,"
"corralling the market," "declaring dividends," and abusing
each others' "Company," they served to while away
many an idle interval. The last afternoon out, we "consolidated,"
shook hands over the "union," elected a full
"Board of Officers," and adjourned to receive our "joint
dividends," at New York; but hitherto have never been
so fortunate as to get a "quorum" together there, and
doubt now if we ever will.

CHAPTER VIII.

THE INDIANS       GEN. SHERMAN       KIT CARSON, ETC.


At Fort Garland, in San Louis Park, Sept 21st, Gov.
Cumming, Gen. Sherman, and the famous Kit Carson
(then Bv't. Brig. Gen. U. S. Vols.), met in council,
concerning the Utes and the Indian question generally.
Sherman, as elsewhere intimated, was then in the
midst of a long tour by ambulance, through the
heart of the Indian country embraced in his then
Military Division, and as he had already travelled
about 1200 miles, with no escort except a couple
of staff-officers and the necessary teamsters, without
seeing a hostile Red Skin, he was getting to be somewhat
skeptical on the whole Indian subject. The grand Treaty
with the Utes was to come off Sept. 22d and 23d on the
banks of the Rio Grande, some thirty miles northwest
from Fort Garland; but as Sherman had decided to leave
Garland on the 22d for his return east via the Arkansas,
a preliminary council was called at Fort Garland on the
21st. Runners had been sent out a day or two before,
and the Big Chiefs of the Utes kept arriving all that
day. The council was held late in the afternoon, in a
large room back of the commandant's quarters. The
chiefs were grouped on one side of the room, squat upon
their haunches, grave and dignified; while on the other
sat Sherman in loose uniform, puffing a cigar, with Gov.
Cumming on one side and Kit Carson on the other.[Pg 114]
Carson served as interpreter, speaking Mexican well,
which the chiefs mostly understood. After some preliminary
skirmishing, Sherman said he had called them
together to ascertain whether the Utes were willing to
quit their nomadic life and settle down on a Reservation.
He urged this upon them, as their true interest,
if they wished to maintain their tribal existence, and
said he had only come among them to promote their
happiness and welfare. He added, he had recently been
visiting many other tribes with the same object and purposes,
and as a friend to their race was convinced their
only hope for the future lay in going on a Reservation.
The chiefs debated the matter among themselves for
awhile, and presently made answer, that they thanked the
Big Warrior for his suggestions and approved them; but
that their young men were opposed to such a policy, and
they feared it would be difficult to persuade the Utes of
its wisdom, until the Cheyennes and Comanches       their
hereditary foes       had first adopted it. The council
lasted an hour or more, with much skillful fencing
and adroit diplomacy on the part of Ooray and Ancantash,
the head-chiefs; but this was the substance of all
that Sherman could worm out of them. He tried to
explain and reason with them in various ways, but at
last broke up the council in disgust, and blurted out in
his peculiar way, as he strode back to his quarters,
"They will have to freeze and starve a little more, I
reckon, before they will listen to common sense!" Subsequently
he told us of a council that he had held about a
fortnight or so before, at Fort Laramie or somewhere up
there, with the Arrapahoes or the Sioux. He had urged
upon the chiefs, that their white brothers were opposed
to war and desired peace, and he hoped there would be
no more bloodshed in that region between the Red[Pg 115]
Man and the Pale Face. The chiefs presently replied,
with a wariness worthy of Talleyrand, that they reciprocated
his Quaker sentiments, and would do all in their
power to enforce them; but that their young men were
rash and fiery sometimes, and it might be difficult
to hold them in. "Well, then," said Sherman to the
interpreter, firing up, "Tell the rascals so are mine; and if
another white man is scalped in all this region, it will be
impossible to hold mine in." The chiefs saw the point,
and no doubt sagely concluded they would have trouble,
if ever they got Tecumseh Sherman fairly after them.

The grand Treaty with the Utes came off, as I have
said, on Sept. 22d and 23d, on the banks of the Rio Grande,
some thirty miles or so northwest from Fort Garland. We
left Garland early in the morning by ambulance, and reached
the treaty ground soon after noon. Gov. Cumming and
Indian Agent Hunt had preceded us, and on arriving we
found them just sitting down to discuss a Rio Grande trout,
nearly as large as an eastern shad. The Utes had pitched
their lodges a mile or so away, in a bend of the river,
but they were constantly passing to and fro on horseback
and afoot. Apparently none of them ever walked, if he
could afford the luxury of a pony, and often one puny
pony was made to carry two or three lubberly fellows at
a time. Evidently the Plains Indians are as averse to
walking, as the traditional Texan, who is said never to
leave his door-sill without mounting a mustang. These
Ute ponies are hardy, sagacious little fellows, some of them
very handsome, and are of course, the lineal descendants
of the wild horses of the Plains. Ooray, their head
chief, rode a bright little bay, that would have taken a
first-class premium almost anywhere. Of course, they
get no grain, but subsist exclusively on grass. They
constitute their owners' chief wealth, and a Ute will part[Pg 116]
with almost anything sooner than his pony. Braves,
squaws, papooses, all ride astride, and generally at a gallop.
They seldom use the spur, but rarely mount without a
whip, and this they keep going pretty steadily while on
the road. Their saddles are rude affairs of wood, with
very short stirrups; but their bridles are better made,
and usually have some kind of an iron bit, if at all
obtainable.

In the course of the afternoon, hundreds of the
Indians thronged our little camp, in all varieties of
costume, though chiefly in breech-cloth and blanket or
buffalo-robe. Both sexes dress much alike, and at first
it was difficult to distinguish one from the other, though
you soon came to know the squaws from their smaller
stature. The paraphernalia of some of them was ludicrous
in the extreme. One young buck had managed to
secure an old-style artillery hat, with long scarlet horsehair
plume, and a dilapidated white shirt; and as he
strutted about in these (only these and nothing more!)
considered himself wholly en regle. Another, the
princess and beauty of the tribe, a dirty belle of seventeen,
resplendent in paint and feathers, was arrayed in
much gorgeousness of beads and buckskin, and whiffed
her cigarritos by the hour together. During the morning
she had ridden her thirty miles, man-fashion, with
the chiefs from Fort Garland, and in the afternoon she
lolled about camp in magnificent indolence. Her laugh
was rich and musical, and she seemed indeed quite a pet
with the tribe.

The afternoon was passed in preliminary arrangements
for the Treaty, and towards evening a number of
us walked over to the Indian village to return our calls.
We found it to consist of perhaps three hundred wigwams,
arranged pretty regularly in streets, and containing[Pg 117]
in all some twelve hundred souls. The wigwams or
lodges were made of skins and hides, stretched over
circularly inclined poles       rude originals evidently of our
army Sibley tents       with an opening at the top for the
smoke to escape through. At the door were planted
their spears or lances, and shields; inside, on skins or
blankets, the braves were fast asleep or playing cards;
without, the youngsters were playing ball or practicing
with the bow and arrows. We wandered through the
streets until nightfall, striking up a talk or barter in our
broken Ute the best we could, and had some interesting
experiences. Just then the village was all agog with
excitement and joy. The day before, their Agent had
given them several beeves, which they had at once
slaughtered and partly eaten; the surplus was now
hanging all about on lariats and poles, curing in the dry
atmosphere. "Jerked-beef," I suppose, our Plains-men
would call it. A flock of sheep had also been given
them, and the squaws were now busy "corraling" these,
as we happened along. A few refractory ewes refused
to enter the corral       a slight enclosure of brush       and
these were being hotly pursued by the boy-braves and
dogs. The dogs headed them off on all sides, while the
boys lassoed them one after another, until the squaws
came up and caught them. It was fine practice for the
lasso, and the youngsters seemed to enjoy it greatly.
Dogs abounded everywhere. Each wigwam seemed to
have a goodly supply, and the village at large a brigade
besides. They were small wolfish-looking curs, as a rule,
and the most vociferous and incessant yelpers I ever
listened to. They had no regular bark       only a wild
yelp, like their savage ancestors, the cayotes of the
Plains. It is only the civilized dog, that "bays deep-mouthed
welcome"       that has a full, open "bark"       and[Pg 118]
this he loses when he relapses to savagery again. There
was no moving anywhere about the village, without
having a score or more of them yelping at your heels;
but this seemed to be the extent of their hostile intentions.
When they became rather noisier than usual,
some passing squaw would dash at them with a stick
and a shower of "God dams," and that would scatter
them for the time. Most of our Indians have all learned
to swear the rough oaths of the Border, and always
swear in English, as they have no corresponding words
in their own language. In describing cavalry, they put
the thumb and forefinger of one hand on the palm of the
other, and then move them along in imitation of a
gallop. In speaking of ox-trains, they stretch out their
arms, and say, "Whoa-Haw! Git!" But when they
come to mule-teams, they invariably speak of them as
"God dams! Go 'long!" because of the copious oaths
our teamsters hurl at them. Indeed, the average Indian
always speaks of the donkey, as a "God dam," and
thinks that the correct name. These Utes in general, I
must say, seemed to be much more thrifty and comfortable
than we had anticipated, though doubtless some of
this was due to the recent generous issue of supplies by
the Agent.

Our party scattered pretty well through the village,
one after another halting to palaver with acquaintances
we had picked up; but as it grew dark, we gradually
drifted together and prepared to return. Dr. M. was still
bargaining with a chief for a fancy shield he wanted as
a souvenir, when the rest began moving off, and begged
me to wait a minute until he was through. Several
minutes passed by, and then his bargaining ended in
failure       the Big Chief refusing to "swop"       their universal
word for selling or trading. Then we started to[Pg 119]
overtake the rest, but they had passed out of view in the
deepening twilight, and though we hallooed to them could
get no answer       the hubbub of the village evidently
drowning our voices. Emerging from the wigwams, we
soon discovered, that neither of us had taken any proper
notes of the landmarks, as we came over, being busy
talking with the rest, and consequently neither knew the
way back. Here was a pretty predicament, surely, for
two ambitious young men       cast away in a village of a
thousand savages, unable to speak a sentence of their
language intelligibly or they ours, night already come,
and no hint of how to extricate ourselves. To make it
doubly absurd, we presently discovered, that our only
belligerent weapons, whether for offence or defence, consisted
of a Rogers' penknife apiece. We had been so
remiss, as to leave camp without our revolvers       a precaution
that no Mountain or Plains-man ever neglects.
While pondering the "situation," we luckily caught sight
of the Sierra Blanca glistening in the moonlight, and as
we knew this to be southeast of our camp we concluded
our route lay toward it. We set off accordingly, and
had made perhaps a quarter of a mile, across sloughs now
dry and through the rank grass, when one of us suggested,
that we could not be going right, or our camp-fires would
appear. This seemed reasonable, the country was so
level; so a halt was ordered, while we scanned the
horizon for fires elsewhere. Presently far away to the
left, we descried a fire blazing loftily up, and concluded
this must be ours, and that our comrades had put on extra
fuel to guide us the better home. The direction seemed
wrong, judging by the position of the Sierra Blanca; but
as it was the only fire visible, except those at the Indian
village, we concluded it must be ours, and changing our
course struck for it accordingly. A trudge of a mile or[Pg 120]
more, with an occasional tumble into a dry slough, at
length brought us to the fire, when to our disappointment
we found it to be only the camp-fire of two rough-looking
customers, who said they were out "prospecting" for
mines. They said they had reached there just at nightfall,
from a long trip through the Mountains, and as yet
had seen nothing of our camp, and of course knew nothing
of its whereabouts. Two Utes were squatted before the
fire, who they said had just rode over from the village,
and we asked one of the men, who had been talking with
them in Mexican, to inquire the way to "Kit Carson's
Camp" for us. He did so, and the Indians jumping up
responded, they would conduct us there. We thought
now we were in luck, surely, and thanking the miners
for their kindness prepared to follow our copper-colored
friends. Unloosing a little pony, that was picketed near
by, they both clambered upon him, and then with grunts
and mutterings to each other, of which we only understood
an occasional "God dam," they rode along ahead
for perhaps a quarter of a mile, when suddenly they
turned round on the pony without stopping, chattered
and gibbered away at us for a minute or two like monkeys,
and then with a wild whoop, that for a moment quite
dazed us, galloped wildly off toward the Indian village.

We were now worse off than ever, and our affairs
were evidently coming to a crisis. Of course, we halted
again, and called another "council of war." M. advised
going back to the miners' camp-fire, and trusting our fortunes
for the night with them. I objected that we knew
nothing about them; that they were suspicious looking
customers anyhow       hadn't the air of genuine miners;
and suggested that we camp down where we were, on the
banks of a bayou, as there was plenty of dry wood there
for a fire, and when morning came we would hunt up the[Pg 121]
Rio Grande, and follow it down to our lost camp. He
assented to this, but on reflection I further suggested,
whether it wouldn't be better, after all, to go boldly into
the Indian village, and govern ourselves by circumstances.
We knew Ooray and Ancantash, the head chiefs, and why
not ask for them? If we could find them, our troubles
would be over. If we couldn't, at the worst, we could
claim the hospitality of some other chieftain, and quarter
for the night in a Ute wigwam. I urged that the Indians
already knew where we were anyhow, and also knew that
we were unarmed and lost; that it would be disagreeable
to hear their arrows whizzing around us there, or perhaps
be scalped and tossed into the bayou before morning;
and that, in short, I would risk the Utes, if he would.
M. approved the plan, as the best we could do under such
dismal circumstances; so off we trudged again for the
Indian village, which by that time we were beginning to
wish we had never seen. We tried to keep our courage
up by discussing Mark Tapley, and his philosophy of the
"jolly;" but the result could hardly be called a success.
Perhaps the two braves who had so suddenly deserted us,
with such unearthly whoops, were lying in wait for us
somewhere ahead! Perhaps the next step we would
hear an arrow whiz by, or over us       perchance through us!
Nevertheless, I remember also a ludicrous feeling at the
idea       after escaping unscathed from the rebellion       of
falling ignominiously there, on the banks of the Del Norte,
by the hand of a Ute, with only a pocket-knife to defend
myself with!

However, we proceeded cautiously forward, with
many a halt and "hist," and presently without molestation
reached the village again. The dogs, of course,
challenged our approach with a multitudinous yelping,
as before: but some friendly squaws appeared, and[Pg 122]
soon dispersed them with a copious shower of "God
dams." Approaching a lodge in which we saw a
number of Indians reclining around a fire, we tried to
make them understand, that we were lost and wanted
to find the way to "Kit Carson's Camp;" but met with
the same poor success as before. Then we inquired for
Ooray and Ancantash, but they either did not comprehend,
or else were unwilling to bother with us, as their only
answer was a grunt       "Ugh"       or a stare. Evidently, on
reflection, they concluded we were bores, for they soon
resumed their pipes, and the low drawling song they were
crooning when we entered. We tried two or three more
lodges, with the same result, and had about made up our
minds to camp down for the night, where we were, when
M. suggested that we try one more wigwam, and if
we failed there to give it up. This seemed almost providential;
for as we entered the lodge-door, up sprang a lithe
young chief, whom we had met during the day, and came
smiling toward us with the greeting, "How, Gen-e-ral!
How, Doc-tor! Know me? Me, Wellington!" (How is all
the Indian has learned yet of How do you do? or How are
you?) Greasy and dirty as the fellow was, we could
have hugged him with delight; for now we knew our
troubles were all over. We answered him, "O yes!
Know Wellington, of course! In our wigwam to-day!
But lost now! No find wigwam! Kit Carson's Camp?"
He comprehended our lingo, and "the situation," in a
moment, and quickly replied, "Yes! Wellington go!"
and then, with an eye to the main chance, shrewdly
added, "How much?" We answered, "Two paint,
and some tobacco." He held up three fingers, and bargainingly
responded, "Three paint, and 'baccy a heap?"
By "paint" he meant little packages of Indian paint       blue,
vermillion, yellow       such as some in camp had[Pg 123]
brought along for barter, and we readily acceded to his
terms. As it was growing late, he asked another young
buck to go along, who demanded the same terms, which
of course we cheerfully granted. Then they took up
their bows and arrows, drew their blankets around their
shoulders, and bidding the rest "bueno noche" we moved
off.

We soon observed, that they were conducting us
toward the Sierra Blanca, in the same direction that we
took originally. We questioned Wellington about this,
but he persisted it was right; and so we pushed on,
though not without some misgivings. A half hour or so,
however, brought us safely to camp, where we found our
friends discussing our absence, and wondering what had
become of us. We cautioned each other to say nothing
about our adventure; but the joke was too good to keep,
and the facts all came out in the course of the evening, as
we sat around the camp-fire and smoked our fatigue away.
However tame it may read now, it was exciting and
romantic enough at the time, and I record it here for the
moral involved, to wit: 1. Mind your topography, on
leaving camp; 2. Never quit camp, without your rifle or
revolver!

Of course, we paid Wellington and his friend their
paint and tobacco, and dismissed them with hearty
thanks. We won their hearts by inviting them both to
lunch next day, and continued fast friends during the
rest of our stay there.

The next day (Sept. 23d) having been set apart for
the Treaty, Indians of both sexes and all ages at an early
hour began to swarm through our encampment. All, of
course, were naturally on hand, to hear the Big Talk and
share the many presents. The chiefs and braves were
there first, gorgeous in paint and feathers; but long[Pg 124]
before the Council assembled, the poor squaws also
arrived, freighted with their papooses. The spot selected
was a sloping sward on the banks of the Rio Grande, and
but a short distance therefrom. Blankets were spread on
the grass for the Commissioners and head chiefs: the
young chiefs and braves formed a rude circle around
these; and beyond these still were the women and children.
The four leading men seemed to be Ooray, Arrow,
Sha-wa-she-wit, Blue Flower, Ancantash, and Chi-chis-na-sau-no,
also abbreviated into Shauno. The head chief
of the tribe, and the finest looking Indian we had yet
seen, was Ooray. He was a medium sized, athletic looking
man, of about forty, with as fine an eye and head, as
you will see anywhere. Moreover, he was very neat and
clean in his person, as if he believed in the saving virtues
of soap and water       something wonderful for a Red Skin.
Two or three years before, he had made the tour of
Washington and the East, and to-day wore the handsome
silver medal, that President Lincoln then gave him. Kit
Carson said he had made good use of this eastern trip,
and being already a rising man, the knowledge and experience
then acquired had since raised him to the king-ship,
notwithstanding his want of age       several of the chiefs
being older, but none so shrewd as he. The head-warrior,
however, was Ancantash, and he was certainly one of the
coolest and bravest looking men I ever met. He was a
reticent, reflective, but very observant man, with many
of the calm characteristics of our own Grant, and no
doubt is quite as desperate and obstinate a fighter in his
small way. Kit Carson cited instances of his prowess, that
showed supreme manhood and courage; but there is not
room for them here. Shauno, taller and more dignified,
had a face and form much like Tecumseh's, and altogether[Pg 125]
was about as fine a looking specimen of the savage as
history makes mention of.

The Council opened, as usual, with a general smoke,
the pipe being passed for a whiff or two from one to
another all around, and then Gov. Cumming proceeded
to address his copper-colored friends. He said the Great
Father at Washington had made him Big Agent for Colorado[8],
and as such he had come down from Denver, to
bring them their annual presents, hear their grievances,
if any, and have a general talk about their future welfare.
This was interpreted by Kit Carson into Mexican, with
profuse pantomime, after the Indian fashion, and then
reinterpreted by Ooray into Ute for the benefit of his red
brethren. It was received with a general grunt of satisfaction
all round, and then Ooray replied:

"Good! Let the Big Chief speak on!"

"Our Father at Washington has many children, both
white and red, and the Great Spirit bids him regard all
alike. He has watched his red children, the Utes, a long
time, and generally found them peaceable and friendly.
Therefore, he loves them very much, and is pained to see
them diminishing in numbers from year to year. He
thinks this is because of their wars with other tribes, and
increasing scarcity of game, and believes if they would
settle down in one place, like his pale-face children, they
would be much better off. Then they could raise cattle,
and sheep, and barley, and have comfort and plenty
always."

To which, Ooray:

"True! So; a heap! Utes got plenty now. Hunt
give. But soon all gone, and then Utes starve a heap.
Long time ago, Utes always had plenty. On the prairie,[Pg 126]
antelope and buffalo, so many Ooray can't count. In the
mountains, deer and bear, everywhere. In the streams,
trout, duck, beaver, everything. Good Manitou gave all
to red man; Utes happy all the year. White man came,
and now Utes go hungry a heap. Game much go every
year       hard to shoot now. Old man often weak for want
of food. Squaw and papoose cry. Only strong brave live.
White man grow a heap; Red man no grow       soon die
all."

To which, Gov. C.:

"Our Great Father knows all this, and it grieves him
very much. But he can think of no way to remedy it,
except by the Utes quitting their wandering life, and settling
down on a Reservation. If they will do this, and will
stop fighting the Cheyennes and Comanches, he will have
a good Reservation set apart for them, with water, wood,
and grass in abundance. He will give them cattle, sheep,
seeds, and implements. And he will send good white
men among them, to teach them farming, etc. By this
means, the Utes will soon have houses and fields, flocks
and herds, the same as white men, and all will be better
off and happier."

To which, Ooray:

"Yes! So! Much true! Ooray and Big-Chief understand,
and know Utes must go on Reservation some day       raise
beef, pony, and barley       or perish. But young
braves no understand; hard to make 'em. Some, too,
say, if Utes go on Reservation, Cheyennes and Comanches       enemies
of Utes always       will know where to find.
Then some night, when Utes all asleep, will come like a
squaw and kill a heap. Utes hate Cheyenne       Comanche       God
dam!"

"But our Great Father will prevent that. He will[Pg 127]
build forts, and station his blue coats near you, and they
will keep off the Cheyennes and Comanches."

When this was interpreted to Ooray, for the first
time he lost his savage dignity, and laughed outright.
When he reinterpreted it to the Utes, there was a general
chorus of laughter, which lasted several minutes.
Evidently, they had little respect for the average soldier
of the Plains, whether infantry or cavalry. Presently,
however, Ooray recovering his dignity replied:

"Why don't our Great Father's blue-coats keep off
the Cheyennes and Comanches some now? Last snow
the Comanches came right by the forts, found the Utes
in one place, and killed many. Utes killed Comanches
back a heap. Now Utes move about much       hunt buffalo
on the prairie       build wigwam in the mountains       fish in
Del Norte. Utes stop not in one place, and Comanches
no find. But Utes settle down; then Comanches come
and kill. Tell Great Father, Cheyennes and Comanches
go on Reservation first; then Utes will. But Comanches
first."

This was about the same answer substantially, that
they had given Gen. Sherman down at Fort Garland;
and with all his diplomacy, Gov. C. could not extract
more from them. There was a deal of good common
sense in it, too       the instinct of self-preservation       and
the governor could not help admitting this, much as he
desired to enforce the views of the Government. He
rehashed his arguments, and presented them anew in
various ways; but to all of them, Ooray steadily made
answer:

"Ooray has spoken!" And there the matter ended.

Subsequently, after some considerable talk with his
brother chiefs, Ooray resumed:

"Suppose Utes go on Reservation, and bad pale-face[Pg 128]
come and shoot Indian; what will our Great Father do
then?"

"Why," answered Gov. C., "Our Great Father will
have him arrested and tried in his courts; and, if found
guilty, will hang him. If the Great Father's own
brother, he would hang him all the same."

Ooray had great difficulty in understanding this.
Gen. Carson had to repeat and explain it a number of
times, before he could comprehend what a court and jury
were, and even then he seemed somewhat dazed. Doubtless
he found it hard to believe, that we would hang any
white man for killing an Indian, let alone our Great
Father's brother, after what he had seen and heard of law
and justice on the border. But after much questioning
back and forth, he appeared to catch some glimpse of the
idea, and after pondering it awhile, sorrowfully answered:

"Yes! So! Ooray comprehend! Much good! But
my people no comprehend. No make them now."

He seemed to think there was no use, in even trying
to get such an idea into their heads, and communicated
to them some short answer, which apparently satisfied
them.

Again, after much deliberation, he warily asked:

"Suppose pale-face steal pony from red-man, what
will Great Father do?"

To which Gov. C.:

"He will compel the pale-face to restore the pony.
And if the thief can't be found, and his red children
prove their loss, the Great Father will pay for it in goods
or money."

This seemed to give great satisfaction, when he first
interpreted it; but presently the chiefs became excited,
and a hot discussion spread among them. Kit Carson[Pg 129]
said, as well as he could make out, they were canvassing
among themselves, whether on the same principle the
government would not compel them to restore or pay for
what they stole from the whites; and as their thefts were
evidently much the larger, they speedily directed Ooray
to dodge this question, without further talk.

There was some other desultory conversation, and
much repetition necessarily; but the above is about the
substance of it all. The council lasted two or three
hours, and finally wound up with a dignified expression
of thanks by Ooray, for the interest the Great Father
and Gov. C. took in them. This was followed by a
general expression of "Bueno! Bueno!"[9] by the rest
of the Indians, and so the pow-wow ended. The
governor managed his side of the affair with much
shrewdness and ability, but failed to secure the positive
pledges the government so much desired. On the other
hand, Ooray certainly conducted himself with great
dignity and good sense, for an "untutored savage," and
fully realized our old-time notions of an Indian chieftain.
Should he live, he will yet make a figure among the
Indians, and go down to history as a Logan or a Red-Jacket.
His trip to Washington, he told me, convinced
him, it was idle for his people to contend with the pale-faces,
and his counsels were always for peace and civilization.
Subsequently, some months afterwards, when
the Utes rose in hostilities against his advice, he deliberately
repaired to Fort Garland and gave himself up,
refusing to have anything to do with the tribe, until they
laid down their arms again. All honor and praise to
this dusky son of the Plains and Mountains!

After the council broke up, there came a grand distribution
of presents, the most sensible of which were a[Pg 130]
flock of sheep and a small herd of cattle. The balance
amounted to but little in a practical point of view,
though the Utes of course were delighted with their
beads, paint, scarlet blankets, gilt trinkets, etc. The
Agents seemed to deal fairly and honestly by their savage
wards, and I doubt not Mr. Hunt (since Gov. of Colorado)
did his duty in the premises very faithfully.

During the day, and indeed most of the time we
were there, there was considerable bartering going on
between some of us and the Indians, though in a petty
way. We were eager for Indian relics and trophies, to
send East as souvenirs, and they were equally eager for
some articles we possessed; so that barter was not difficult.
Neither party knew much, if any, of the language
of the other, but the bargaining went steadily on for all
that. The Utes came into camp, with such articles as
they wished to dispose of. If we desired them and had
anything to exchange, we laid it on the ground, and then       pointing
to the Indian articles       uttered the classic word
"Swop?" If they assented, the bargain ended, and the
exchange took place immediately. But if they refused,
or wanted more, they shook their heads and answered
"No swop!" These words, "Swop" and "No swop,"
are about the only English necessary in trading with
them, and we found them current everywhere among our
Indians, from the Missouri to the Pacific. In this way,
our party succeeded in securing a few lances and shields,
bows and arrows, grizzly-bear skins, buffalo-robes, etc.,
though their stock of skins had been mostly disposed of
to the regular traders some time before. We found
them, as a rule, fond of trading, and keen at a bargain,
but averse to parting with their ponies or their bows and
arrows. Their ponies they held in special regard, and
asked extravagant prices for them. Their bows and[Pg 131]
arrows were made of tough, elastic wood, very scarce in
that region, and they were loth to sell them, except for
a pistol or a "carabina." In this matter of trading, however,
a young chief named Jack Cox seemed to be a
marked exception. He had a handsome wolf-skin quiver,
beautifully finished and embroidered       the finest we saw
there       and I was desirous of securing it, if he cared to
part with it. Various offers were tendered him, but all
were refused. He had set his heart on one of our repeating-rifles,
and his constant answer was, as he patted the
barrel, "Me take carabina! Nothing else!" Subsequently,
others pressed him with various offers; but they
could not shake his resolution. At last he rose up, as if
vexed and irritated, and pointing to a group of Utes, who
were crowding around all eager for barter, indignantly
exclaimed, "Mean Indian swop       pony, bow, quiver,
robe, any thing! Jack Cox no swop!" Instinctively I
handed him a pipe, and begged him to join in a smoke.
Accepting the courtesy, he sat down again, and as he
spoke a little broken English we managed to talk some
on several subjects. But, all the while, he watched the
"swopping," that was going on about him, and when
he saw any one about to make what he considered a
foolish or bad bargain, he would sneer at his want of
judgment, and set all the rest of the Indians to laughing
at him       a trick which usually broke up the bargain.
Subsequently, he went off to the village for a fancy buffalo
robe, which he said he would "swop" me for something
that pleased him, and kept his promise by returning
with it an hour or so afterwards. This Jack Cox
was a bright, shrewd young fellow       lithe, sinewy and
straight as an arrow       about seventeen or eighteen years
of age; and, if he live, will doubtless yet distinguish
himself among the Utes. He was already much deferred[Pg 132]
to among those of his age, and was decidedly the keenest
one among them. He had heard of Washington and the
east, and asked many curious questions concerning them.
I inquired if he would not like to make a trip east, as
Ooray and others had done. He answered, after reflecting
a little:

"How long be gone?"

I replied at hap-hazard:

"Perhaps five snows," meaning five years.

He rejoined,

"O, no! No! Not five snows! One snow! Then
Jack Cox go!"

He interested us very much at the time, and we all
augured well of his future.

The same evening Wellington and Jack Cox sent
word, that they were going to have a Big Dance over at
the village, and invited us all over. Accordingly soon
after dark their tom-toms began to beat, and at about
8 p. m., several of us walked thither. The dance had
already commenced, on a natural lawn that sloped down
from the village to the Rio Grande. Here were perhaps a
hundred or so young braves, with hand locked in hand and
shoulder pressed to shoulder, moving slowly round in a
circle facing inward, while back of them were gathered
the whole village gazing on. Two or three of them beat
time on rude drums or tom-toms, while all joined in a
wild chant or song. The music was barbarous, and their
movements not much of a dance; but they went through
it all with much gravity and earnestness, whatever they
meant by it. Jack Cox left the crowd as we approached,
and invited us to participate, which several did. One
was allowed to beat the tom-tom, as a special favor; but
his performance proved to be not a "success," as he
failed to keep time. We spent an hour with them, and[Pg 133]
no doubt the Utes will long remember the occasion,
when their pale-face friends from the east danced with
them by moonlight on the banks of the Rio Grande.
Altogether, it was rather a unique experience, and we
wondered what would come next. As we strolled back
to camp, the moon had mounted above the Sierra Blanca,
and was flooding the whole Park with a sea of light.
The notched and jagged peaks of the Mountains all
about us, tipped with snow, glittered in her beams. And
the hour and the place seemed, for all the world, more
like a chapter from fairy land, than sober reality.

As already intimated, we found some striking characters
among the Utes       Ooray, Ancantash, Jack Cox, etc.       but
they were few and far between. The great mass of
the tribe were small, undersized men, with coarse, animal
faces, that looked as if they went hungry half the time,
if not more. Their dress in general consisted of the
usual breech-cloth, a blanket or buffalo-robe, and deer-skin
leggings and moccasins. The nights and mornings
were already sharp and chilly; but they had a knack of
twisting a robe or blanket about them, even when on
horseback at a gallop, that I have never seen equalled, and
they declared they were not uncomfortable. In winter,
however, especially their winter, we would suppose they
must suffer from the weather severely. They seemed to
treat their poor squaws about as shabbily as all other
Indians       that is to say, about as bad as bad can be.
They compelled them to wait upon and serve them on
every possible occasion, no matter how degrading. In
coming to and going from our encampment, the braves
always galloped or trotted along on horseback, while the
squaws as a rule trudged wearily by on foot, with their
papooses at their backs. It was the squaws, who made
their bows and arrows, spears and shields       dressed their[Pg 134]
skins       pitched and struck camp       saddled and unsaddled
their ponies       and, in short, performed all other menial or
laborious offices, that Indian life is heir to. They carried
their papooses strapped to a board, with a wicker-work
at the top to protect the child's head       the whole swung
over the shoulders or across the forehead by a rude thong.
This board was made round at the lower end, to rock
backward and forward when necessary, and thus serve as
a sort of cradle. In camp it is hung up on a tree, which
places the child out of danger, while at the same time the
wind sways it to and fro. On the march, the whole dangles
from the mother's shoulder. Some of these Ute
cradles were quite neatly adorned with paint and bead-work,
and made as soft and cosy as buck-skin and buffalo-robe
or beaver-fur could make them. The papooses
occupying them, with their jet-black eyes and copper-colored
cheeks, seemed to be model babies; for they never
even whimpered. The wretched and degraded condition
of their women, however, is everywhere the reproach of
savage life. There was a forlorn and hopeless look in the
faces of these Ute squaws, as if all their womanhood
was crushed out, that would have touched a heart of
stone. A father, we are told, may chastise any of his
children, but a mother only her daughters. She must
not lay a finger on a boy-brave, on pain of death; and
this is only a specimen of her disabilities. On the whole,
I must say, we were not favorably impressed with Ute
life, as a rule. It had its romantic features, but their universal
"shiftlessness," their long matted hair sweeping
loosely about their faces or hanging in heavy plaits around
their shoulders, their general squalor, raggedness and
dirt, and above all, their neglect and abuse of their poor
squaws       all made a bad impression and dispelled many
of the poetic ideas about the "Noble Red Man," "Lo,[Pg 135]
the poor Indian, etc." that we cherish in the east. In
spite of our preconceived notions, we could not help
regarding the great majority of them, as but little above
the wild animals, that roam over the Plains and through
the Mountains with them; and as a whole       for all practical
purposes of citizenship       infinitely below the colored
race, even of the cotton states. Of course, there were
some noble exceptions, such as Ooray and Ancantash, but
then they only proved the rule. In point of intellect
and character, and promise of improvement, the African
will certainly beat the Red Man all to pieces, as the
future will show. Nevertheless, I must say, we found
the Utes truthful and honest in their way, and Kit Carson       a
good judge       credited them with being the bravest
and best Red Skins he had ever met, in all his wide wanderings.

I have spoken several times of Kit Carson, and as he is
a real historical character, perhaps can not conclude this
chapter better, than with a word or two more in regard to
him. We met him first at Fort Garland, where we found
him in command of a battalion of New Mexico Volunteers,
and Brevet Brigadier-General. When the war broke
out, and most of our troops were withdrawn from the
Plains and Mountains, he applied to Mr. Lincoln for
permission to raise a Regiment of Volunteers in New
Mexico, to protect our settlements there, and the "good
President" very properly granted it. At the head of
these, Kit did excellent service during the war, on one
occasion taking 9,000 Navajoes prisoners with less than
600 men, and at its close was ordered to Fort Garland
and given command of a wide region there. We found
him in log quarters, rough but comfortable, with his
Mexican wife and half-breed children around him. We
had expected to see a small and wiry man, weather-beaten[Pg 136]
and reticent; but met a medium sized, rather
stoutish, florid, and quite talkative person instead. He
certainly bore the marks of exposure, but none of that
extreme "roughing it," that we had anticipated. In age,
he seemed to be about forty-five. His head was a
remarkably good one, with the bumps of benevolence
and reflection well developed. His eye was mild and
blue, the very type of good nature, while his voice was
as soft and sympathetic as a woman's. He impressed
you at once as a man of rare kindliness and charity, such
as a truly brave man ought always to be. As simple as
a child, but brave as a lion, he soon took our hearts by
storm, and grew upon our regard all the while we were
with him. He talked and smoked far into the night
each evening we spent together, and we have no room
here for a tithe of what he told us. Born in Kentucky,
he emigrated to the Plains and Mountains when a child,
and attached himself to a party of trappers and hunters,
when he was so small that he couldn't set a trap. When
he became older, he turned trapper himself, and as such
wandered all over our possessions, from the Missouri to
the Pacific, and from British America to Mexico. Next
he became a government scout and guide, and as such
piloted Fremont and others all over the Plains and through
the Mountains. He confirmed the accounts, we had heard,
that Fremont, as an explorer, was somewhat of a charlatan,
and said the worst time the Pathfinder ever had was,
when on one of his expeditions, he disregarded his (Kit's)
advice, and endeavored to force the Mountains northwest
of where Fort Garland now stands. Kit told him he
could not get through or over them at that period of the
year, and, when Fremont nevertheless insisted on proceeding,
he resigned as guide. The Pathfinder, however,
went sternly forward, but got caught in terrible snow-storms,[Pg 137]
and presently returned, with half of his men and
animals perished outright, from cold and hunger. Subsequently,
Kit became a U.S. Indian Agent, and one of
the best we ever had. Familiar with their language and
customs, he frequently spent months together among them,
without seeing a white man, and indeed became sort of
half Indian himself. In talking, I observed, that he frequently
hesitated for the right English word; but when
speaking bastard Spanish (Mexican) or Indian, he was as
fluent as a native. Both Mexican and Indian, however,
are largely pantomime, which may have helped him along
somewhat. The Utes seemed to have the greatest
possible confidence in him, and invariably called him
simply "Kit." Said Sherman, while at Garland, "These
Red Skins think Kit twice as big a man as me.
Why his integrity is simply perfect. They know it, and
they would believe him and trust him any day before
me." And Kit returned this confidence, by being their
most steadfast and unswerving friend. He declared all
our Indian troubles were caused originally by bad white
men, and was terribly severe on the barbarities of the
Border. He said he was once among the Indians for two
or three years exclusively, and had seen an Indian kill
his brother even, for insulting a white man in the old
times. He protested, that in all the peculiar and ingenious
outrages for which the Indians had been so much
abused of late years, they were only imitating or improving
on the bad example of wicked white men. His
anathemas of Col. Chivington, and the Sand Creek massacre
of 1864, were something fearful to listen to. He
pleaded for the Indians, as "pore ignorant creatures,"
whom we were daily despoiling of their hunting grounds
and homes, and his denunciations of the outrages and[Pg 138]
wrongs we had heaped upon them were sometimes really
eloquent.

Said he, "To think of that dog Chivington, and his
hounds, up thar at Sand Creek! Whoever heerd of
sich doings among Christians! The pore Injuns had our
flag flyin over 'em, that same old stars and stripes thar
we all love and honor, and they'd bin told down to Denver,
that so long as they kept that flyin they'd be safe.
Well, then, here come along that durned Chivington and
his cusses. They'd bin out several days huntin hostile
Injuns, and couldn't find none no whar, and if they had,
they'd run from them, you bet! So they just pitched into
these friendlies, and massa-creed them       yes, sir, literally
massa-creed them       in cold blood, in spite of our flag thar       women
and little children even! Why, Senator Foster
told me with his own lips, (and him and his committee
investigated this, you know), that that thar d              d miscreant
and his men shot down squaws, and blew the
brains out of little innocent children       even pistoled little
babies in the arms of their dead mothers, and worse than
this! And ye call these civilized men       Christians; and
the Injuns savages, du ye?

"I tell ye what; I don't like a hostile Red Skin any better,
than you du. And when they are hostile, I've fit
'em       fout 'em       as hard as any man. But I never yit
drew a bead on a squaw or papoose, and I loathe and hate
the man who would. 'Tain't nateral for brave men to kill
women and little children, and no one but a coward or a
dog would do it. Of course, when we white men du sich
awful things, why these pore ignorant critters don't know
no better, than to follow suit. Poor things! I've seen as
much of 'em as any white man livin, and I can't help but
pity 'em! They'll all soon be gone anyhow."

Poor Kit! He has already "gone" himself to his[Pg 139]
long home. But the Indians had no truer friend, and he
would wish no prouder epitaph, than this. He and Sherman
were great friends, and evidently had a genuine
regard for each other. They had known each other in
California in '49, when Sherman was a banker there, and
Kit only an Indian guide. In '65, when Kit was at Leavenworth
on a visit, Sherman sent for him to come down
to St. Louis, and they spent some time together very
pleasantly. Now Sherman returned his visit, by coming
to Fort Garland, in the heart of the Rocky Mountains.
It will be betraying no secret to say, that Sherman had
but a poor opinion of the Plains country, especially of
New Mexico and Arizona; for he did not hesitate to say
so anywhere. While at Garland, he told the following
good story one night, as we all sat smoking around the
fire, and he will pardon me for repeating it here. He
said the Quartermaster General during the summer had
written him several letters, calling his attention to the
enormous cost of our posts on the Plains, in New Mexico,
etc., and begging him if possible to suggest some plan,
that would reduce expenses, etc. "At first," said Sherman,
"I paid no attention to these letters, because I
could not help the matter. The Posts were there       established
by order of the Hon. Secretary of War       and
he knew it. Moreover, the people would have them
there, and I could not help it, if they did cost a 'heap.'
Above all, I was ordered to keep them up, and I always
obey orders; so what could I do? So, at first, I did
not answer his letters, but let him write away! But
finally they got to coming so thick and long, that one
day I sat down and replied, that the Posts were all
there, and ordered there, as he knew, and we were
bound to supply them, no matter what it cost. But
that, in my judgment, of the whole vast region there,[Pg 140]
the greater portion was not worth a Confederate note
to us, and never would be; and if he wished my opinion
as to the best way of reducing expenses, I would
respectfully recommend, that the United States sell
New Mexico, and all the region round about, to Maximilian
for $15,000,000, and lend him the greenbacks to
pay with!

"I must say, the government don't seem to have
considered my recommendation favorably yet. But
neither have I received any more letters from the Q.
M. Gen'l. So, I suppose, he is satisfied!"

He told this with infinite gusto, as if he enjoyed the
joke hugely, and presently added:

"The idea, however, wasn't wholly my own, but
was suggested by an old story we used to hear about
Gen. Sumner. You knew Sumner, I suppose, in
the East? We used to call him Bull Sumner, in old
times, because he was so obstinate, and so thoroughly a
soldier. Well, some years ago, he was sent out to command
in New Mexico, and he certainly entered upon his
duties with great alacrity and enthusiasm. He was
going to explore the country, he said, make known its
vast resources, pacify the Red Skins, induce immigration,
settle up the country, and thus do away with our costly
Posts, and all that. Of course, he was sincere in the
matter       always was sincere       one of the honestest men
I ever knew. So, he went to work, and for two or
three years worked hard, summer and winter       did a
vast amount of work. But, finally, he came to the
same conclusion I have       viz. that the whole region was
worthless       and reported to the Secretary of War, that
in his judgment, the wisest thing we could do, would be
to buy out the New Mexicans and pay them to emigrate       to
old Mexico, if possible       and then throw the whole[Pg 141]
country open (and keep it open) to the buffalo and the
Indians!

"Sumner, they say, recommended this seriously, and
thought it a good thing. But I have never heard that
the government agreed with him, any more than it will
with me!"

These were the stories substantially; but it is impossible
to give the twinkle of his eye, the jocular toss of
his head, and the serio-comic twitch of his many-wrinkled
features, as he got them off. Meanwhile he smoked
furiously, and kept up that everlasting long stride of his
up and down the floor, with his hands deep in his
trowsers' pockets, as if he would never weary. Sherman
is a great talker and smoker, and beyond doubt a great
man and original thinker in many ways. At the Denver
banquet, he made a better speech than his distinguished
brother (the Senator from Ohio); and it is no wonder he
outwitted Joe Johnston, and smashed Hood as he pleased,
when "marching through Georgia." Neither is it any
wonder, when you come to scan him closely, that he
should sometimes err a little, as he did at Raleigh.
Evidently, with all his great talents, now and then he
needs a "governor" to steady him, as much as any
other steam-engine does. Then, he is a hundred horsepower
or more; and as General of the Army, long may he
live!

The Treaty over, we returned to Denver through
the heart of the Mountains, as related in the preceding
chapter; and now for Salt Lake and beyond.



[Pg 142]




CHAPTER IX.

DENVER TO SALT LAKE.


From Denver, we shipped eastward by express the
various Indian trophies, we had secured       shields,
lances, bows and arrows, grizzly bear-skins, etc.       and rested
for a day or two. We found the weather there hot and
oppressive, compared with what we had experienced in
the Mountains, and the change to the dry atmosphere of
the one, from the moist air of the other, affected us very
sensibly. Here they were still wearing summer clothing,
though in the Mountains we needed our great-coats, and
Denver mocked at winter as weeks yet to come. From
Denver the Mountains as a whole seemed grander than
ever; and the view of them at sunset from our hotel windows
could scarcely be finer, as the snowy range and
the heaven-kissing peaks one by one faded away, through
orange, crimson and purple into night. The majesty and
grandeur of the general range impress one more there
at Denver, I think, than elsewhere; and then, there is
always something new about these mighty Mountains       they
never seem the same for an hour together. A difference
of clouds, or of atmosphere, or of your own point
of vision, makes all the difference in the world; and to me,
I confess, the Rocky Mountains from Denver were always
a constant joy and perpetual delight. So calm, so grand,
so superb, such stately rest, such profound peace. As if
they upheld the sky, and steadied the earth, and did it[Pg 143]
easily. If there be no God, no being of infinite wisdom
and goodness, there ought to be one, to account for the
might and majesty, the beauty and sublimity, with which
the universe is filled, when it might so easily have been
monotonous and commonplace.

Finally, Oct. 4th, we closed up our duties at Denver,
and started for Salt Lake. The stage left at 8 p. m., and
after much hearty hand-shaking and kindly good-byes, we
were at last off for the Pacific. For the first time we fully
realized, that we had definitely cut loose from the Atlantic
States, and had a long and toilsome trip now before
us. I remember a feeling of sadness, as this conviction
came sharply upon me; but we were soon whirling across
the Platte, and off for Laporte. The fare through to
Salt Lake, some 600 miles, with 25 pounds of baggage,
was $150, currency; meals extra, at $1,00 and $1,50 each.
Our coach, "Red Rupert," was a mountain mud-wagon,
with a low canvas top, so as to be less liable to capsize in
crossing the range, than a regular Concord Coach, and
was intended for ten passengers       nine inside and one
outside. As we had only half that number of passengers,
however, we thought we would get along very comfortably.
We had gamey, spirited horses, that carried us along
quite rapidly, until near midnight, when we stuck fast in a
mudhole, and all hands were ordered up to help shift baggage
and lift the coach out. Next morning early we rolled
into Laporte, having made seventy-five miles since leaving
Denver. It was a bright clear morning, with a crisp
bracing air, and we sat down to an excellent breakfast of
fried elk, potatoes, eggs, etc., as hungry as wolves. In
the corner of the room, at a rude table, sat a little bearded
man, eyeing us occasionally as he bent over his maps and
papers, whose face seemed familiar; and presently I recognized
him as Gen. Dodge, an old acquaintance of war[Pg 144]
times in Tennessee in 1864. Now he was Chief Engineer
of the Union Pacific Railroad, and was here comparing
maps and surveys, to see whether they couldn't find
a shorter route to Salt Lake, than the somewhat circuitous
one by Bridger's Pass. He recognized me about the
same moment, and we had a hearty hand-shake and chat
over old times.

Past Laporte, our road speedily entered the foot-hills,
or "hog-backs" as the Coloradoans call them; and all day
long we were bowling ahead, either between or across
these. These abrupt ridges hid our view of the Plains
and Mountains usually, so that the day's ride as a whole
proved dull and monotonous. We were well armed, but
saw no Indians, nor any game worth mentioning. It
was plain, that the road was gradually ascending, but
there were no sharp ascents, and but little to indicate,
that we were actually crossing the Rocky Mountains.
The country, as a whole, was rocky and barren in
the extreme. Here and there the old red sandstone
cropped out, and had been fashioned by the elements
into all sorts of curious forms, which travellers had named
Castle Rock, Steamboat Rock, Indian Chief, etc. The
day's ride ended at Virginia Dale, where we got a tolerable
dinner, and found an exquisite little valley, as if
nature was trying just there quite to outdo herself.
Abrupt mountains tower all around and shut it in like a
picture, while the entrance to and exit from the vale are
bold and precipitous. With its limpid stream, green
sward, and bristling pines, it seemed like an oasis in the
desert of the foot-hills there; and a party of miners
encamped there for the night, en route from Montana to
the States, appeared to enjoy its freshness and beauty to
the full. We met several such parties of miners between
Denver and Salt Lake, all bound east to winter, expecting[Pg 145]
to return in the spring. They said the difference in
the cost of living would more than pay them for the trip,
while at the same time they would be with their families
and friends. They moved in parties of a dozen or
so, and said they considered themselves safe against all
hostile comers, whether Road Agents or Indians. They
were all well-mounted, and literally bristling with rifles,
revolvers, and bowie-knives. Their baggage and "traps"
generally were usually piled high on pack-horses or mules,
that they drove along ahead of them. They all carried
their own provisions, and when night came camped down
by the nearest stream, where there was wood, water, and
grass. Such a life has its hardships and risks, but is not
without its enjoyments also; and many an eastern cockney
might well envy the big-bearded, bronzed, weather-beaten,
but apparently thoroughly happy fellows, that we
met en route.

We left Virginia Dale about 6 p. m. and the same
night about 10 p. m. reached Willow Springs, one of the
most desolate stage-stations on the road. It was a raw
chilly night, and while the stage-men were changing
horses, all of the passengers except myself got out and
strolled off to the station-house       a hundred yards or so
away       to get warm. Weary with the stage ride of two
days and nights continuously, I remained half-dozing in
the coach, wrapped in my buffalo-robe, when suddenly I
was aroused by a distant noise, that grew rapidly louder
and nearer, and presently came thundering down
the road directly toward the station. While pondering
what it could be, half-sleepy still, all at once the station-keeper,
who was helping with the horses, broke out
with:

"I say, Tom (our driver), hark! Do you hear that?"

"Yes, Billy! What the deuce is it?"

[Pg 146]

"Why, good heavens, it must be the infernal Injuns,
shure as you live! The d       d Red Skins, I reckon, hev
jest stampeded that Government-train down the road
thar; and they'll all be yer, licketty split, quicker than
lightnin', you bet!"

I was wide awake in a second, now. They pushed
the horses quickly back into the stable, and shouted to
me to seize all the arms and hurry to the station-house.
I was not certain, that it was not better to stand by the
coach, and "fight it out on that line," come what might;
but concluded the stage-men knew more about such
encounters than I did, and so followed their directions.
Out I tumbled, gathered up all the rifles and revolvers I
could lay my hands on, and rushed to the station-house,
shouting "Indians! Indians!" Soon the driver and
stock-tenders came running in from the stable, as fast as
their legs could carry them; and for a few minutes we
thought we had the Indians upon us at last, sure enough.
The pluck of the party, I must say, was admirable.
L. and M. stood to their guns. Nobody thought of
flight or surrender. But all quickly resolved, as we
grasped our rifles and revolvers, to make the best
stand we could, and to fight it out in that shanty, if it
took all summer. But presently, as the mules thundered
up the road and past us, just as we were about to fire on
one of their pursuers, we saw him tumble from his horse
all sprawling, as it stumbled across a chuck-hole, and as
he gathered himself up heard him break out swearing in
good vigorous English, that stamped him as a Pale Face
beyond a question. The swearing probably saved his
life, however objectionable otherwise, and we were soon
at his side. We found him more stunned, than hurt,
and presently his comrades succeeded in stopping the
herd. They were unable to say what had caused the[Pg 147]
stampede; but as no Indians appeared, we were soon off
on the road again.

These "stampedes" of animals are not uncommon on
the Plains, and sometimes prove very embarrassing. A
herd of mules, well stampeded, will run for miles, over
every thing that opposes them, until they tire themselves
thoroughly out. Had we been on the road, they would
probably have stampeded our stage-horses       thundering
up so behind us       and then there would have been a
break-neck race by night, among the Rocky Mountains,
that would have been rather exciting, not to say more.
It is a favorite trick of the Indians, when they want to
steal stock, to stampede them thus at night, and then run
off the scattered animals. A large freight-train, that we
subsequently heard of, had lost all its mules a few nights
before by such a stampede, and been compelled to send
back to the nearest settlement for others.

Thence on to the North Platte, our route wound over and
between foot-hills and ridges, where the general ascent
was indeed perceptible, but never difficult. One by one
we flanked the main ranges, and at old Fort Halleck,
8,000 feet above the sea, found a natural depression or
cañon through the Mountains, in the absence of which
a wagon-road there would be seemingly impossible. It
really appeared, as if nature had cleft the range there
expressly to accommodate the oncoming future; and we
swung through it, and so down to the North Platte, at a
steady trot. Here and there, in crossing the ridges, we
caught exquisite glimpses of snowy peaks off to the west,
and of the far-stretching Laramie Plains off to the east;
but the country, as a whole, was barren and desolate.
We reached the North Platte just at dusk, having made
104 miles in the last 24 hours. This seemed a good
day's drive, considering we were crossing the Rocky[Pg 148]
Mountains; but it was not quite up to the regular
schedule. We had hoped to get down into the
Platte valley before dark, but daylight left us before we
reached the station. We had caught long stretches of
the valley, as we came over the ridges and down the
bluffs; but darkness fell so suddenly, we saw little of it
close at hand. Parts of it, we were told, are well
adapted to farming, and nearly all of it could be made
cultivable by proper irrigation; but it seemed too cold
for anything but grass, and the more hardy cereals. No
doubt it could be made available for grazing purposes,
and the cañons of the neighboring Mountains would
afford shelter and grass for winter. Antelope and elk
were reported quite abundant still in the valley. We
saw a herd of antelope feeding quietly, a mile away,
soon after we struck the valley, and at the station they
gave us elk-steaks for dinner       "fried," of course, as
usual. Gold was reported in the Mountains beyond,
but little had been done there yet in the way of mining.
No doubt the Rocky Mountains are penetrated nearly
everywhere by gold-bearing veins, and where these crop
out, and water runs, "placer mines"       more or less lucrative       will
be found. We found the North Platte a very
considerable stream, though readily fordable then and
there. It had already come a long distance through and
out of the Mountains, and now struck eastward by Fort
Laramie, for its long journey through the Plains to the
Missouri. What a delightfully lazy, dreamy, lotus-eating
voyage it would be, to embark upon its waters in an
Indian canoe, far up among the Mountains, and float
thence day by day, and week after week, adown the
Missouri, via the Mississippi, to the sea!

At North Platte, we changed our mountain mud-wagon,
for a coach lighter and less top-heavy still, and[Pg 149]
pushed on continuing to ascend. We left Colorado near
Fort Halleck, and were now in Wyoming. At Bridger's
Pass, we were at last fairly across the Rocky Mountains       had
left the east and the Atlantic slope behind us       and
turned our faces fully Pacificwards. The North Platte
was the last stream flowing east, and about 3 a. m., after
leaving it we struck the headwaters of Bitter Creek, a
tributary of Green River, that flows thence via the great
Rio Colorado and the Gulf of California two thousand
miles away to the Pacific. The Rocky Mountains, the
great water-shed of the continent, were thus over and
past; but we had crossed the summit so easily we were
not aware of it, until our driver informed us. Our first
introduction to the Pacific slope was hardly an agreeable
one. At our great elevation the night was bitterly cold,
and we had shivered through its long hours, in spite of
our blankets and buffalo-robes. Routed out at 3 a. m.,
for breakfast, we straggled into the stage-station at Sulphur
Springs, cold and cross, to find only dirty alkali
water to wash in, and the roughest breakfast on the table
we had seen yet, since leaving the States. Coffee plain,
saleratus-biscuit hot, and salt pork fried       only this and
nothing more       made up the charming variety, and we
bolted it all, I fear, as surlily as bears. A confused
recollection of cold, and discomfort, and misery, is all
that remains in my memory now of that wretched station
at Sulphur Springs, and may I never see the like again!

Long before daylight we were off on the road again,
and now had fairly entered the Desert of the Mountains,
the famous or infamous "Bitter Creek Country," accursed
of all who cross the continent. Here, when the sun got
fairly up, the sharp keen winds of the night hours
changed to hot sirocco breezes, that laden with the alkali
dust there became absolutely stifling. Alkali or soda       the[Pg 150]
basis of common soap       abounds throughout all this
region for two or three hundred miles, and literally
curses all nature everywhere. It destroys all vegetation,
except sage-brush and grease-wood, and exterminates all
animals, except cayotes and Indians. The Indians even
mostly desert the country, and how the cayotes manage
to "get on" is a wonder and astonishment. The wheels
of our coach whirled the alkali into our faces by day and
by night, in a fine impalpable dust, that penetrated
everywhere       eyes, ears, nose, mouth       and made all
efforts at personal cleanliness a dismal failure. The only
results of our frequent ablutions were chapped hands
and tender faces       our noses, indeed, quite peeling off.
In many places the alkali effloresced from the soil, and at
a little distance looked like hoar-frost. It polluted the
streams, giving the water a dirty milky hue and disgusting
taste, and in very dry seasons makes such streams rank
poison to man and beast. The plains of Sodom and
Gomorrah, after the vengeance of Jehovah smote them,
could not have been much worse than this Desert of the
Mountains; and good John Pierpont must certainly have
had some such region in his mind's eye, when he wrote
so felicitously:


"There the gaunt wolf sits on his rock and howls,
And there in painted pomp the savage Indian prowls."


One wretched day, while traversing this region, one of
our passengers, from whom we expected better things,
unable to "stand the pressure" longer, indulged too
freely in Colorado whiskey; and that night we had to
fight the delirium tremens, as well. He tried several
times to jump out of the coach, and made the night hideous
with his screams; but we succeeded finally in getting
him down under one of the seats, and thus carried him[Pg 151]
safely along. As if to add to our misfortunes, soon after
midnight one of our thorough-braces broke, and then we
had to go humping along on the axle-tree for ten or
twelve miles, until we reached the next station. This
no doubt was a good antidote to John Barleycorn; but
it scarcely improved our impressions of "Bitter Creek."

At Laclede, in the heart of the Bitter Creek Country,
we halted one day for dinner, and were agreeably surprised
by getting a very good one. This station had
once been famed for the poorness of its fare, and so great
were the complaints of passengers, that Mr. Holliday
resolved to take charge of this and several others himself.
He imported flour and vegetables from Denver or Salt
Lake, and employed hunters on the Platte to shoot antelope
and elk, and deliver them along at these stations as
required. The groceries, of course, had all to come from
the Missouri or the Pacific. We found a tidy, middle-aged,
Danish woman in charge at Laclede       a Mormon
imported from Salt Lake       and she gave us the best meal
we had eaten since leaving Laporte or Denver. We complimented
her on the table, and on the general cleanliness
and neatness of the station; and she seemed much
gratified, as she had a right to be.

Our ride through the Bitter Creek region, as a whole,
however, was thoroughly detestable, and how the slow-moving
emigrant and freight trains ever managed to
traverse it was surprising. The bleaching bones of
horses, mules, and oxen whitened every mile of it, and
the very genius of desolation seemed to brood over the
landscape. Nevertheless, the station-keepers averred, there
were cañons back of the bluffs, where grass grew freely;
and they pointed to their winter's supply of hay in stack,
as proof of this. So, too, at Black Buttes station, we
found good bituminous coal burning in a rude grate, and[Pg 152]
were shown a bluff a hundred yards away where it was
mined. Elsewhere we heard of petroleum "showing"
well, and one day I suggested to our driver, that as the
Creator never made anything uselessly, there must be
some compensation here after all.

"Bother, stranger!" he rejoined; "The Almighty'd
nothin to du with this yer region. 'Tother fellar (pointing
downward) made Bitter Creek, ef it ever war made
at all; tho, I reckin, it war just left!"

"But what about the coal?" I said.

"Dunno ef there's enny thar! But ef thar be, Providence
only 'lowed it, jist to help in the last conflaggerration       you
bet! He didn't mean enny human critter
to live yer, and mine it       not by a long shot       you bet!"

At several points, however, we observed the bluffs
abounded in slate shales, and other coal-bearing earths;
and as we suspected then, the Union Pacific Railroad
has already developed a vast deposit of coal there. Bitter
Creek itself flowed sluggishly by us for a day or so,
and was a little miserable stream, that just managed to
crawl       usually at the bottom of a deep gulch or abrupt
cañon       its chalky color proclaiming its alkali taint even
before you tasted it. We must have followed it for
a hundred miles or more, and yet it continued very
nearly the same in size throughout. What water it
drained in one locality was largely evaporated in another,
and its wretched, villanous character made it everywhere
an eye-sore, instead of a pleasing feature in the landscape
as it should have been. But enough of Bitter
Creek, and its God-forsaken region.

Past Green river, here a considerable stream, we
entered the Butte region, and one evening just before
sunset approached Church Butte, the most famous of
them all. It was too late in the day to explore it, but we[Pg 153]
had a grand view of it in the shifting sunlight, as we
drove slowly by. On the box with the driver, a portion
of it was pointed out, that resembled a colossal Dutchman,
about lifting to his mouth a foaming beaker. Further
on, as we rolled westward, the Teuton faded out, and the
church-like character of the Butte more fully appeared.
Seen from the west, it presents a very wonderful likeness
to an old-time cathedral, of the Gothic type, and at a distance
might well be taken for the crumbling ruins of some
such edifice, though of cyclopean proportions. Porch,
nave, dome, caryatides, fluted columns, bas-reliefs, broken
roof and capitals       all are there in shapes more or less perfect,
and the illusion was very striking in the shadowy
twilight. The Butte itself, like most others there, is a
vast mass of sandstone, covered with tenacious blue clay,
both of which are being constantly chiseled down by wind
and rain. These buttes all seemed either to have been
upheaved from the dead level around them, or else to
be the surviving portions of great mountain chains, from
which the earth has been washed or blown away, leaving
their skeletons       so to speak       behind in solitary grandeur.
The latter theory seemed more probable, judging
by the general direction of the buttes themselves. Much
of the scenery about here for a hundred miles or
so, was enlivened by sandstone bluffs, cut and chiseled
by the elements into castles, fortresses, etc., that frowned
majestically at us in the distance; but we were only too
glad to quit their grandeur and sublimity, that turned
only to barren rocks as we approached, and to hail some
signs of cultivation again as we neared Fort Bridger. No
doubt the wind has been an important agency in fashioning
all these, though scarcely to the extent that is claimed
by some travellers. In Bowles' "Across the Continent,"
he tells a story about a wind-storm down in Colorado,[Pg 154]
that dashed the sand against a window so furiously, that
a common pane of glass was converted into "the most
perfect of ground glass," in a single night! We met a
good many Coloradoans, who were laughing at this
"yarn," and were told to set it down among other good
"Rocky Mountain" stories. The fact is, people who live
out there on those vast Plains, or among those great
Mountains, become demoralized with the amplitude of
everything; and when they attempt to narrate, unconsciously       I
suppose       get to exaggerating. Not intentionally;
of course not. But bigness "rules the hour,"
and we early learned to distrust       and discount largely       most
of the extraordinary stories we heard.

We reached Fort Bridger late at night (Oct. 8th),
and found ourselves pretty well jaded, both in body and
mind. We had been four days and nights continuously
on the road since leaving Denver, and in that time had
made four hundred and eighty miles. This was the
hardest ride by stage-coach we had had yet, and altogether
was a pretty fair test of one's power of endurance.
We became so accustomed to the coach, that we could
fall asleep almost any time; but slumber in a stage-coach,
or rather "mountain mud-wagon," is only a poor
apology for "tired nature's sweet restorer," after all.
The first night out, there being but five of us, four each
"pre-empted" a corner, while the fifth man "camped
down" on the middle seat. Along about 11 p. m. we
struck a piece of extra good road, the conversation gradually
wound up, each settled back into his great-coat and
robe, and presently we were all fairly off into dreamland.
A half hour or so rolls by, when bump goes the coach
against an obstinate rock, or chuck into a malicious mud-hole;
your neighbor's head comes bucking against you,
or you go bucking wildly against him; the man on[Pg 155]
the middle seat rolls off and wakes up, with a growl
or objurgation, that seems half excusable; your friends
on the front seat get their legs tangled and twisted up
with yours, or you get yours twisted and tangled up
with theirs       you don't exactly know which; and, in
short, everybody wakes up chaotic and confused, not to
say dismal and cross. Of course you try it again after a
while, you wrap your robes still better about you, you
adjust your legs more carefully than before, and settling
down again into your corner, think now you will surely
get a good sleep. However, you hardly get to nodding
fairly, before there comes a repetition of your former dismal
experiences, and so the night wears on like a hideous
dream. A series of unusual jolts and bumps disgusts
every one with even the attempt to sleep, and presently
all hands drift into a general talk or smoke. The history
of one night is the wretched history of all       only
each successive one, as you advance, becomes "a little
more so." Long before reaching Fort Bridger, we were
in a sort of a half-comatose condition, with every bone
aching, and every inch of flesh sore, and with the romance
of stage-coaching gone from us forever. Now, if a man's
body were made of india-rubber, or his arms and legs
were telescopic, so as to lengthen out and shorten
up, perhaps such continuous travelling would not be
so bad. But, as it is, I confess, it was a great weariness
to the flesh, and looking back on it now, with the Pacific
Railroad completed       its express trains and palace-cars in
motion       I don't really see how poor human nature managed
to endure it. Conversation is a good thing per se,
but most men converse themselves out in a day or two.
So, a good joke or a popular song helps to fill the hiatus
somewhat, and accordingly we buried "John Brown,"
and "Rallied round the flag," and "Marched through[Pg 156]
Georgia," day after day, until they got to be a "bore,"
even to the most severely patriotic among us. Our only
constant and unfailing friends were our briar-wood pipes,
and what a corps de reserve they were! Possibly smoking
has its evils       I don't deny it       but no man has thoroughly
tested the heights and depths of life, or shall I
say its altitudes and profundities, its joys and its sorrows,
its mysteries and miseries       especially stage-coaching       who
has not bowed at the shrine of Killykinnick, and
puffed and whiffed as it pleased him. There is such
comfort, and solace, and philosophy in it, when sojourning
on the Plains, or camped down among the Mountains,
or cast away in a stage-coach, that all the King Jameses
and Dr. Trasks in the universe, I suspect, will never
be able to overcome or abolish it.

Our horses were usually steady-going enough, the
splendid teams of the Plains; but one night, just before
reaching Fort Bridger, we had a team of fiery California
mustangs, never geared up but once before, and, of course,
they ran away. The road was slightly descending, but
pretty smooth, and for the time our heavy, lumbering
mountain mud-wagon went booming along, like a ship
under full sail. Presently, too, the lead-bars broke, and
as they came rattling down on the heels of the leaders,
we had every prospect for awhile of a general over-turn
and smash-up. But our driver, a courageous skillful Jehu,
"put down the brakes," and at length succeeded in halting
his runaways, just as we approached a rocky precipice,
over which to have gone would have been an ugly piece
of business. We expected an upset every minute, with
all its attending infelicities; but luckily escaped.

We halted at Fort Bridger two or three days, to inspect
this post and consider its bearings, and so became
pretty well rested up again. Some miles below the[Pg 157]
Fort, Green River subdivides into Black's and Smith's
Forks, and the valleys of both of these we found contained
much excellent land. Judge Carter, the sutler and postmaster
at Bridger, and a striking character in many ways,
already had several large tracts under cultivation, by way
of experiment, and the next year he expected to try
more. His grass was magnificent; his oats, barley, and
potatoes, very fair; but his wheat and Indian corn
wanted more sunshine. The post itself is 7,000 feet
above the sea, and the Wahsatch Mountains just beyond
were reported snow-capped the year round. Black's
Fork runs directly through the parade-ground, in front
of the officers' quarters, and was said to furnish superb
trout-fishing in season. In summer, it seemed to us,
Bridger must be a delightful place; but in winter, rather
wild and desolate. Apart from the garrison, the only
white people there, or near there, were Judge Carter and
his employees. A few lodges of Shoshones, the famous
Jim Bridger with them, were encamped below the Fort;
but they were quiet and peaceable. The Government
Reservation there embraced all the best lands for many
miles, and practically excluded settlements; otherwise no
doubt quite a population would soon spring up. Sage-hens
abounded in the neighboring "divides," and we
bagged several of them during a day's ride by ambulance
over to Smith's Fork and return. We found them larger
and darker, than the Kansas grouse or prairie-chicken;
but no less rich and gamey in taste. Maj. Burt, in command
at Bridger, was an enthusiastic sportsman; but our
ambulance broke down seven miles out, and we had to
foot it back after dark.

We were now in Utah proper, and Judge Carter was
Probate Judge of the young county there. A Virginian
by birth, from near Fairfax Court-House, he enlisted in[Pg 158]
the army at an early age, and served as a private for
awhile in Florida. It was a romantic freak, and his
friends soon had him discharged; but he still continued
with the army, as purveyor or sutler. Subsequently,
he accompanied our troops to California; but afterwards
returned east, and followed Albert Sidney Johnston to
Utah in 1858. When in that year Fort Bridger was
established, he was appointed sutler, and had continued
there ever since. Gradually his sutler-store had grown
to be a trade-store with the Indians, and passing emigrants;
and in 1866 he reported his sales at $100,000 per
year, and increasing. He was a shrewd, intelligent man,
with a fine library and the best eastern newspapers, who
had seen a vast deal of life in many phases on both sides
of the continent, and his hospitality was open-handed
and generous even for a Virginian.

We left Fort Bridger October 12th, at 10 p. m., in the
midst of gusty winds that soon turned to rain, and
reached Salt Lake City the next night about midnight;
distance 120 miles. We halted for breakfast at the head
of Echo Cañon, and were at a loss to account for the air
of neatness and refinement, that pervaded the rude
station, until we noticed Scott's Marmion and the Bible
lying on a side shelf. Two nice looking ladies waited on
the table, and it is safe to conclude a taste for literature
and religion will keep people civilized and refined almost
anywhere. Echo Cañon itself proved to be a narrow rocky
defile, some thirty miles long through the heart of the mountains
there, with a little brawling creek flowing through it.
Its red sandstone walls mostly tower above you for several
hundred feet, and in places quite overhang the road.
Here in 1857-8, Brigham Young made his famous stand
against the United States, and flooded the cañon by
damming the creek at various points. The remains of[Pg 159]
his dam, and of various rude fortifications, were still
perceptible; but Judge Carter reported them all of small
account, as Johnston's engineers knew of at least two
other passes, by either of which they could have flanked
the Mormon position, and so entered the valley. He
said, our troops should have marched at once on Salt
Lake, without halting at Bridger as they did; but the
Mormons showed fight, and our commanding officer       not
liking the looks of things       called a council of war,
after which, of course, we did nothing. Councils of war,
it is well-nigh settled, never do. Clive, that brave
soldier of his time, never held a council of war but
once, and then made his fortune by disregarding its decision.
When Sidney Johnston assumed command, late
in the fall of 1857, he had no orders to advance; and,
therefore, inferred he was wanted merely to maintain the
status quo! Accordingly he made haste to do nothing,
and soon after went into winter-quarters. Meanwhile,
Brigham       unmolested by our show of force       waxed fat
and kicked. The next spring a compromise was effected,
which like most other "compromises" decided nothing,
and left the "saints" as saucy as ever. Judge C. knew all
the men of that troubled period well, especially Army people;
and said he had long thought, that the reason why
the troops were not ordered forward was, because Davis,
Floyd,       Co., were already looking ahead to secession in
the near future, and did not care to establish coercion as a
precedent. They feared such a precedent might be quoted
against their own "sovereign" States, in such a contingency,
and so managed to have the Army instructed
How not to do it, until Brigham found a convenient loop-hole,
and crept out of the scrape himself. Verily, the
ways of politicians are "past finding out!"

Past Echo Cañon, we struck Weber Valley, and here[Pg 160]
found ourselves at last thoroughly among the Mormons.
Fine little farms dotted the valley everywhere, and the
settlements indeed were so numerous, that much of the
valley resembled rather a scattered village. The little
Weber River passes down the valley, on its way to Great
Salt Lake, and its waters had everywhere been diverted,
and made to irrigate nearly every possible acre of ground.
Fine crops of barley, oats, wheat, potatoes, etc., appeared
to have been gathered, and cattle and sheep were grazing
on all sides. The people looked like a hardy, industrious,
thrifty race, well fitted for their stern struggle with the
wilderness. Everybody was apparently well-fed and
well-clad, though the women had a worn and tired look,
as if they led a dull life and lacked sympathy. Children
of all ages and sizes flocked about the gates and crowded the
doorway, and to all appearances they were about the same
frolicking youngsters that we have east, though they seemed
less watched and cared for. Near the head of the valley,
we saw several coal-drifts that had already been worked
considerably, and were told that these mines supplied all
the coal then used in Utah, though it was thought coal
would soon be found elsewhere. It was of a soft bituminous
character, far from first-class, but nevertheless
invaluable in the absence of something better.

Just at dark, we found ourselves at the head of
Parley's Cañon, and still several miles distant from Salt
Lake City. Snow-flakes had sifted lazily downward all
day, but at night-fall they changed to sleet, which
thickened presently into a regular snow-storm, and soon
the roads usually so good became heavy and slushy. In
many places the track was merely a roadway, quarried
out of the rocky bluffs, with a swollen and angry rivulet
below; and as we wound cautiously along this, both the
coach and horses were constantly slipping and sliding.[Pg 161]
Only a week before, in a similar snow-storm, the stage-horses
lost their foot-hold here, and a crowded coach       team
and all       went crashing down into the creek below.
I had no fancy for this sort of an experience; but when,
soon after dark, we saw the driver light up his side-lamps
for the first time since leaving the Missouri, I concluded
that our chances for an "upset" at last were
perhaps improving. L. got nervous, and being somewhat
mathematical in his turn of mind, fell to calculating
how far it was down to the water and rocks, and what
would be the probable results of plunging down there
quite miscellaneously. But I was half sick and thoroughly
tired out       in that worn and jaded condition,
where a man becomes fairly indifferent as to what may
happen       and at length, as L. averred, went soundly to
sleep, though I had no recollection afterwards of anything
but dozing. I only know that when the horses
again struck a trot, as we began to descend the cañon
westward, I roused up shivering with cold; and was only
too glad, when far away in the distance our driver pointed
out the lights of Salt Lake City, twinkling through the
darkness. It seemed then, as if the coach never would get
there. But at last the farms thickened into suburbs, and
the houses into streets, and a little before midnight we
drew up and halted at the Salt-Lake House. A smart-looking
colored man, acting both as porter and night-clerk,
showed us to a comfortable room, and I need
scarcely say we retired at once. What a luxury it was,
to get between clean sheets once more, and stretch our
cramped up limbs wholly out again, ad libitum! No
one but an Overland stage-passenger can fully appreciate
the downy comfort of a bed, or truly sleep almost the
sleep that knows no waking. How we did sleep and
stretch ourselves, and stretch ourselves and sleep that[Pg 162]
night! It seemed almost as if to sleep was the chief end
of life, and we made the most of our pillows accordingly.



[Pg 163]




CHAPTER X.

AT SALT LAKE CITY.


Our first day in Salt Lake city (Oct. 14) was Sunday,
and of course we rose late       I to find myself
stiff and ill. A package of letters from the east, and a
bath near noon, set me up somewhat, and when the gong
sounded at 1, p. m. we went down to dinner. Here
everything was profuse and excellent, the vegetables and
fruits especially. But apart from the table, the Salt Lake
House proved indifferent, though the only hotel in the
city. Its rooms were small and dingy, and its appointments
of the plainest, though its rates for every thing
were all-sufficient. The policy of the saints had been
opposed to Gentile travel, and hence no hotels at all were
allowed at first. But subsequently Brigham Young built
the Salt Lake House, and leased it to a Mr. Little       our
three-wived landlord       and that paid so well, he was about
erecting a new and enlarged one, commensurate with the
wants and business of the city.

After dinner, as the sun was out brilliantly and the air
bracing, we concluded to take a short stroll. Our snow-storm
of the day before in the mountains had been only
an affair of an inch or two here, and what had fallen was
already fast disappearing. A walk of a square or two
soon revealed the unique and wonderful beauty of this
far-famed town. Its streets, eight rods wide with broad
foot-walks, cross each other at right angles, and down[Pg 164]
each side course clear and rippling streams, fresh from
the neighboring mountains. These spacious streets
divide the city into squares or blocks of ten acres each,
which are in turn subdivided into homestead lots of an
acre and a quarter each, except in the heart of the city,
where of course it is built up pretty solidly for several
blocks. Standing back from the street in these goodly
lots are their houses, built of frame or adobe, usually
only one story high but sometimes two, and with as
many doors ordinarily as the owner has wives. These
were literally embowered in shrubbery and fruit trees, the
grounds having been made wondrously fertile by irrigation,
and as we walked along we could see the apple,
peach, plum, pear, and apricot trees loaded down with
their ripening fruit. The snow of the day before did not
seem to have injured any of them materially, it was so
unseasonable and soon gone. So, too, roses and flowers
in rich profusion crowned the door-yards, while the gardens
beyond seemed heaped with vegetables exquisite in
their perfection and development. Lofty mountains,
their snow-capped summits glittering in the sun-light,
rimmed the valley in, whichever way you turned;
while in the distance, tranquil as a sapphire, flashed the
expanse of Great Salt Lake. To the traveller worn with
stage-coaching, or weary from Bitter Creek, no wonder
Salt Lake seems like Rasselas's Happy Valley, or Paradise
Regained. Imagine to yourself a valley say fifty
miles north and south, by thirty east and west, crowned
above with snow-clad peaks, thick below with clustering
farms, its interlacing streams flashing in the sun-light,
with a fair city of fifteen or twenty thousand people
gleaming in the midst, embowered in fruit and shade-trees,
and you may form some conception of the prospect
that greets you, as you rattle down the Wahsatch range,[Pg 165]
and out into the valley of Great Salt Lake. I doubt
if there is a more picturesque or charming scene anywhere,
not excepting the descent from the Alps into
Italy. You involuntarily thank heaven, that "Bitter
Creek" is over and past, and congratulate yourself on
having struck civilization once more, Mormon though it
be.

We took in much of this scene, as we strolled along,
with senses keenly alive to its beauties and felicities.
Flowers never seemed more fragrant; fruits never so
luscious. In the clear atmosphere how the mountains
glowed and towered! How crisp and elastic was the
air! How the blood went coursing through one's veins!
The streets seemed alive with people, and as they were
moving mainly in one direction we followed on, and
presently found ourselves at the Mormon Tabernacle.
This was an odd-looking, oblong structure, built of adobe,
and with no pretence evidently to any of the known
orders of architecture. Its side-walls were low, and
between these sprang the roof in a great semi-circle, with
narrow prison-like windows near the line where the walls
and roof came together. Outside, the walls were of the
usual dun adobe color; inside, plain white       the whole
utterly devoid of ornamentation whatever. The organ
and choir occupied the end near the street; opposite was
a raised platform, extending entirely across the audience-room,
and on this sat fifty or more plain-looking men       the
priests and chief dignitaries of "the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints." The audience consisted
of perhaps two thousand people       men, women, and
children       all dressed respectably, and though the
average of intelligence was not high, yet as a whole they
were a better appearing people than we had been led to
expect. This edifice was their old tabernacle; the new[Pg 166]
tabernacle, an enormous structure on much the same
plan, but with a capacity of ten or twelve thousand
souls, was not yet completed, though well under way.
Their great Temple had not yet progressed beyond the
foundation stones, and there seemed to be much doubt
whether it ever would. Its plan, however, is on a
magnificent scale, and if ever completed, it will doubtless
be one of the greatest edifices on the continent.

Religious services had already begun, and we found
a Mr. Nicholson, a returned missionary from England,
expatiating at the desk with much fervor. We were too
late for his text, but found him discussing at length the
evidences and undeniability of their peculiar doctrines.
He was a fluent, but vapid speaker, and, with all our curiosity
to hear him, soon became very tiresome. The gist
of his argument was, that the saints knew for themselves,
in their own hearts, that Mormonism was true, and,
therefore, that no Gentile (or outside unbeliever) could
possibly disprove it. He said, "My brethren, we know
our doctrines to be true, yea and amen, forever. They
have come to us by express revelation from heaven, and
we have tested them in our own experience; and, therefore,
to argue against them is the same as to argue
against the multiplication-table, or to doubt logic itself.
Yes, our priesthood, from Brother Brigham down, is
God's own appointed succession, and whoever rejects its
teachings will be damned for time and eternity." He
iterated and reiterated these crude and common-place
ideas for an hour or more ad nauseam, until finally
Brigham Young (who presided) stopped him, and ordered
the sacrament administered. This consisted only of bread
and water, passed through the audience, everybody partaking
of the elements. This over, singing followed, in
which all participated, the chief functionaries leading.[Pg 167]
Now came another "returned missionary," whose name
we missed. He talked for twenty minutes or more, in a
very loose and rambling way, about the work in England
and Wales, and evidently was regarded as a rather "weak
brother," to say the least of him. The next speaker was
George Q. Cannon, a leading dignitary of the church,
and a man of decided parts in many ways. He is an
Englishman by birth, and for awhile after arriving here
served Brigham Young as secretary. Now he was a
stout, hearty looking man, in his prime, with good frontal
developments, and impressed us as the smartest
Mormon on the platform       Brigham, perhaps, excepted.
He spoke for nearly an hour, delivering a calm, connected,
methodical address, and evidently moved his audience
deeply. The substance of his discourse was, that they as
a church were blessed beyond and above all other churches,
because they had a genuine priesthood, appointed by
God himself, and in constant communication with Him.
"Other churches," he said, "in their decadence had
dropped this doctrine, and accordingly had lost their
spirituality and power. But Joseph Smith, in the fulness
of time, found the Book of Mormon, where God
had concealed it, and so became His vice-gerent on
earth. Brother Joseph selected Brigham Young, Heber
Kimball, and Orson Pratt, as his co-workers, and through
these and others Jehovah now communicates his unchanging
will to the children of men. These great and good
men speak not themselves, but the Holy Ghost in and
through them. What we shall speak, we know not, nor
how we shall speak it; but God inspires our hearts and
tongues. Ofttimes we are moved to declare things, that
are seemingly incredible. If left to ourselves, we would
prefer not to declare them. But Jehovah speaks
through us       we are but his mouth-pieces       and what are[Pg 168]
we to do? We must proclaim His solemn revelations,
and to-day I tell you, brothers, what Brother Brigham
has often said before, that the time is not distant       nay,
is near at hand       when the North and South will both
call upon Brigham Young and his holy priesthood to
come and help them re-establish free constitutional government
there. We, here in Utah, have the only free
and Christian government upon the earth, and God has
revealed it to us, that His holy church shall yet occupy
and possess the continent. Some of you may doubt this,
and Gentiles especially may mock at and deride it. But
Jehovah has so spoken it, to Brother Brigham and others,
and many now here will yet live to see this fulfilled.
Heaven and earth may pass away, but my words shall
not fail, saith the Lord!" All this, and much more of
the same purport, he uttered with the greatest solemnity,
as if devoutly believing it, and his audience received it
with a hearty chorus of "amens." There was more singing,
and then Brigham, who had presided over the meeting
as a sort of moderator, dismissed the congregation
with the usual benediction. We had hoped to hear him
speak also, as their great chief and leader; but he was
ailing that day, and so disappointed us.

The speaking, as a whole, scarcely rose above mediocrity,
except perhaps Mr. Cannon's. It was noisy and
common-place, without logic or symmetry, and would
have provoked most eastern audiences to ridicule, rather
than led to conviction. Mr. Cannon evinced much
natural ability; but all seemed quite illiterate, their
rhetoric limping badly, and their pronouns and verbs
marrying very miscellaneously. But little was said about
their "peculiar institution" of polygamy, though it was
alluded to once or twice, and its sacredness assumed.
The singing was strong and emotional, and swept through[Pg 169]
the tabernacle a mighty wave of praise. Of course, it
lacked culture; but then there were passionate and
glowing hearts back of it, for all sang "with the spirit,"
if not "with the understanding also." Their fine organ
we missed hearing, as it was then out of order. A new
and much larger one was building for the new tabernacle,
by workmen from abroad, and this it was claimed
was going to be bigger, if not better, than the great one
at Boston. Let the Hub look to her laurels!

The next morning I found myself down, with what
is termed out there the Mountain Fever. And so this
was the explanation of what had troubled me occasionally,
even before leaving Denver. I had struggled desperately
against it for a fortnight, but now surrendered at discretion,
and was taken to Camp Douglas       the military post north
of the city       where I found sympathizing comrades and a
hearty welcome. This Mountain Fever seems to be an
ugly combination of the bilious and typhoid, with the
ague thrown in, and often pays its respects to overland
travellers, unless they are very careful. In my own case it
yielded readily to calomel and quinine, but only after liberal
and repeated doses of each. For over a fortnight
I wrestled with it there, sometimes hardly knowing
which would conquer; but a resolute determination not
"to shuffle off this mortal coil" in Utah, if I could help
it, and a kind providence at last brought me safely
through. At first, this loss of time was greatly regretted,
as I was eager to complete my duties at Salt Lake, and
push on; but ultimately, I was not sorry, as it afforded
an opportunity to observe and study the Utah problem,
much more fully than I should otherwise have done.

My first day out again, a beautiful October day and
perfect of its kind, the Post-Surgeon advised a ride in the
open air. Accordingly Major Grimes, the Post-Quartermaster,[Pg 170]
brought round his buggy, and together we drove
down to the city, and thence out to the hot Sulphur
Springs. These are on the Bear River road, some two
or three miles north of the city. The water here bursts
out of the ground at the foot of a bluff or mountain, as
thick as a man's leg, and runs thence in a considerable
stream to Great Salt Lake. It has a strong sulphur
color and taste, and a temperature sufficient for a warm
bath. Some miles farther north there are other Springs       we
were told       hot enough to boil an egg. In the
bath-house adjoining, we found a number of men and
boys enjoying the luxury of a sulphur plunge, and the
place appeared to be a considerable resort already,
especially on Sundays. Most passing travellers and miners
endeavor here to get rid of the accumulated dirt of their
journey hitherward, and to depart cleaner if not better men.
A refreshment-saloon near by furnished superb apples
and peaches fresh from the trees, and most other American
edibles, including our inevitable "pies;" but no
drinkables, except tea and coffee. The patrons of the
springs, it was said, complained bitterly of Brigham's
stern, prohibitory liquor laws, but with little result.
Even in Salt Lake City itself, a town of fifteen or
twenty thousand souls, (1866), there were but two or
three drinking-saloons, and these, we were told, were either
owned or strictly regulated by the church i. e. Brigham
Young. Whatever else the saints may be, Brigham
intends that they shall at least not be drunkards, if he
can help it.

Returning we drove by the ruins of the old city-wall,
erected by the Mormons soon after they settled here, of
concrete and adobe, as a defence against the Indians.
The growth of the town and the disappearance of the
Indians, rendered it useless years ago, and it was now fast[Pg 171]
falling to pieces, though no doubt of service in its day.
It was one of Mr. Buchanan's Salt Lake scarecrows in
1857, but would not have stood a half-dozen shots from
an ordinary field-piece, or even mountain-howitzer. The
labor of erecting it, however, must have been prodigious,
as it enclosed originally several square miles, and its
remains even now speak well for the industry and enterprise
of the saints in those early times.

Thursday, Nov. 1st, was a great gala-day at Salt
Lake, and we were fortunate to be there still. It was
the chief day of their annual militia muster, and the
whole country-side apparently turned out. The place
selected was a plateau west of the Jordan, some three
miles from Salt Lake city. Proceeding thither, we found
a rather heterogenous encampment, with not much of
the military about it, except in name. The officers were
mainly in uniform, but the men generally in civilian dress,
and many without either arms or accoutrements. As we
passed through the encampment, they were all out at
company drill. Of course, there were many awkward
squads, but the so-called officers were the awkwardest of
all. In many instances, they were unable to drill their
men in the simplest evolutions; but stood stupidly by,
in brand-new coats, resplendent with brass-buttons, while
some corporal or private, in civilian dress, "put the
company through!"

Soon after noon, a cloud of dust and a large accompanying
concourse of people heralded the approach of the
chief Mormon dignitaries       in carriages. The flag of
the "State of Deseret" floated in the advance; then
came the standard of the old Nauvoo Legion; and as the
procession neared the parade-ground, the "Lieutenant-General
Commanding the Militia of Utah" and a brilliant
staff (chiefly of Brigadier-Generals) moved out to meet[Pg 172]
and escort the hierarchs in. In the carriages, were most
of the leading Mormons then at Salt Lake. Brigham
himself was reported absent sick, but he sent his state-carriage
instead, with Bishops Kimball and Cannon in it.
The Lieutenant-General and staff, with the carriages
following, now rode by in review, after which the troops
formed column and marched by in review. They moved
by company front, and being near the reviewing station,
we made a rough count as they straggled by, and
estimated the total force at about a thousand infantry,
five hundred cavalry, and a battery of artillery. The
cavalry was tolerably mounted; but the artillery was
"horsed" with mules, and consisted of mere howitzers,
no two of like calibre. The personnel of the force was
certainly good; but everything betrayed an utter lack of
discipline and drill. Nevertheless the Mormon officials
seemed greatly elated by the martial array, and much
disposed to exaggerate its numbers. Having been
introduced to his excellency the Commander-in-chief,
"Lieutenant-General etc.," I took occasion incidentally
to ask him how many troops were on the field. He
replied, he could not exactly tell, but he "reckoned"
about three thousand! Afterwards, in reply to a similar
question, his Adjutant-General       a son-in-law of Brigham
Young's, and, of course, a Brigadier-General       answered,
he guessed about four thousand! Other Mormon dignitaries
computed them at from five to six thousand, even.
I said nothing, of course, about my own passing "count;"
but on returning to Camp Douglas, found it substantially
confirmed by a very accurate count, made by another
U. S. officer present, who had a better opportunity.

The true status of this Salt Lake militia appears pretty
clearly, I judge, from the following conversation with
the said Lieutenant-General. We were still "on the[Pg 173]
field," and I had casually asked him, whether this was
the militia of the Church or of the Territory?

"O, of the Territory, of course!" he replied, with a
smile that was child-like and bland.

"But its officers are all Mormons, and its men mostly
so, I believe?"

"Why, yes, sir!" sobering down.

"Its chief officers, especially, I observe, are men
high in the church, like yourself, Generals C               and
Y              , and others I see here; are they not?"

"Well, yes sir!" becoming more grave.

"Are these troops, then, the quota of Utah, or only
of a single county?"

"Only of Salt Lake County. The other counties have
similar organizations, but smaller; and all are required
to spend at least three days per year in camp, for drill and
review."

"To whom, however, does your militia report?"

"To myself only. By act of the Territorial Legislature,
I am Commander-in-Chief of the Utah Militia, and
of course they take orders only from me."

"Then his excellency, the governor of the Territory,
though its chief executive, has no power to call out the
territorial militia, or in any way to control it?"

"Why, no       no       sir! I believe       not!" very hesitatingly,
and as if a good deal confused.

By this time, he began to see the drift of things
somewhat, and suddenly remembered he had important
business elsewhere. This was not surprising; for had he
not already virtually acknowledged, that this whole militia
force       such as it is       was nothing more nor less, than
an auxiliary of the Mormon church, organized and held
well in hand to do her bidding? Gov. Durkee, the territorial
governor, a few days afterwards confirmed this[Pg 174]
view of the subject, and added, that in his judgment this
militia was a standing menace to our authority in Utah,
and would make us trouble there yet. He said, in his
last Annual Message, he had called the attention of the
Legislature to its anomalous character, and recommended
that the militia laws be amended, so that the troops
should report to him, and that he be provided with the
usual staff       Adjutant-General, Quartermaster-General,
Inspector-General, etc.       the same as in all our other Territories.
The Legislature, however, being wholly Mormon,
paid no attention to his recommendations, and he did
not suppose it would very soon. No doubt this militia
from its Lieutenant-General commanding, down, is a mere
creature of Brigham Young's       Mormon in composition
and organization       Mormon in spirit and purpose       Mormon
in body, brain, and soul       and what Brother Brigham
proposes to do with it, it remains for our good-natured
Uncle Samuel yet to see. In case of a future
collision in Utah, between United States and Mormon
authority, we shall probably soon learn.

Two days afterwards the encampment broke up, and
the troops marched into Salt Lake City, and so past the
Bee-Hive House, for Brigham's inspection in person.
Having business with his excellency or reverence (whichever
you choose to call him), accompanied by Major
Grimes, I called that morning, and thus chanced upon
quite an assemblage of their chiefs and dignitaries.
Among them, were Heber C. Kimball, George Q. Cannon,
Bishop West, Lieut.-Gen. Wells, Brig.-Gen. Clawson,
Brig.-Gen. Young, (Brigham, Jr.), Col. Young       another
son       and others, whose names were not noted. Brigham
himself met us at the door, with an ease and dignity that
well became him, and after shaking hands very cordially,
introduced us all around. Our object was to obtain[Pg 175]
certain information for the War Department, about
the region between Salt Lake and the Rio Colorado (then
little known), with a view to supplying Camp Douglas,
and possibly Fort Bridger also, by that route hereafter,
if practicable, via the Gulf of California. The Salt
Lake merchants and others had given us a mass of facts,
or supposed facts, concerning it; but we had been told,
that the Church had made surveys and maps of all the
country between, and that Brigham Young knew more
about the region there, than any other white man living.
The problem was to extract his information, for the
public benefit, if possible. I began by congratulating
him on the general appearance of industry and thrift in
Utah       the wide-spread evidences of their prosperity       (which
one might safely do)       and then, having thus
paved the way, casually asked him why it was, that with
all their shrewdness and intelligence, they still persisted
in wagoning their goods and merchandise twelve hundred
miles from the Missouri, across the Plains and Mountains,
when they might strike navigation       it was alleged       on
the Colorado at less than half that distance? He
answered instantly, with perfect frankness, as if delighted
with the question:

"It is extraordinary, surely! For ten year now, and
more, I've bin tryin' to talk it into our people, that the
Colorado is our true route. But Californy has done
nuthin to open it, or draw us toward her, while New
York keeps tight hold of us; and it is mighty hard to
change the course of trade and travel." And then he
added, by way of comment, "When things git set, it
takes a heap to alter 'em, you bet!" which was certainly
excellent "horse-sense," to say the least of it. A philosopher       not
even the elder Weller       could have said it
better. We discussed the subject very generally for[Pg 176]
some minutes, he appearing full of interest; but presently,
when I began to inquire more minutely about the
intervening country, its roads, resources, distances, etc.,
suddenly, with a flash of intelligence, he seemed to
divine some sinister object, and at once began to "disremember"
(his own word) nearly everything asked him.
He was positive there were no maps or surveys of that
region in the Record Office of the Church, though
subsequently I received copies of several there; and
drew back into his shell on the subject generally, as far
as possible. One of the Bishops present, not perceiving
the studied ignorance of his chief, answered several of
the questions, which Brigham "disremembered," but
presently caught his cue and relapsed into silence. On
most other topics, Brigham talked with much fluency
and politeness; but as to Southern Utah, we soon found
he had no idea of giving any information he could suppress,
and so changed the conversation. We talked for
perhaps an hour, on a variety of subjects, and he
impressed me as anything but an ignorant man, though
slimly educated. He believed their religion to be the
latest revelation of God's will to man, and that it would
yet reform or supplant all others. He thought "plurality
of wives" a Divine arrangement, and essential to Utah,
whatever it might be elsewhere. It had given them the
most frugal and thrifty, the most honest and moral
population on the earth; and what more could be desired?
If Congress didn't like it, they could lump it. God
Almighty would stand by them. He said, Utah now
numbered about a hundred thousand souls, and they were
rapidly increasing. They had gained three thousand
that year (1866), by immigration alone, mostly English
and Welsh; some years they got more, seldom less. He
said their soil and climate were all that could be desired,[Pg 177]
and claimed that by judicious irrigation they could beat
the world, especially in fruits and vegetables. He thought
they had coal, iron, and salt in abundance; but did not
believe their gold and silver amounted to much, and hoped
to Heaven they never would. Subsequently, I learned
from other sources, that silver and copper had been discovered
in considerable richness, at Rush Valley and
elsewhere; but mining operations in Utah, as yet, had
been feeble. The Church was averse to an influx of
Gentile miners, for obvious reasons; and, accordingly, did
all she could to discourage mining, as a business.

This conversation, though lacking in the results desired,
yet afforded an opportunity for observing Brigham
pretty well. Though then about sixty-five, he
looked at least ten years younger, and evidently had
many years hard work in him yet. He was of medium
height, stoutly built every way, and of late years inclining
to corpulency. His hair was a sandy red, now well
sprinkled with gray, and somewhat disposed to curl.
His eyes, a pale blue, were resolute and sagacious; but
had a steely look in them at times, that might mean any
depth of cruelty or tyranny. His nose, though not so
pronounced as his career would indicate, was nevertheless
very characteristic; while his mouth, though
large and firm, had less of the animal about it, than would
naturally be expected. His under-jaw would, perhaps,
strike you more than any other one feature. Heavy and
strong, full and massive, it looked like cast-iron, and at
times, when he talked of Congress or of his enemies, it
would shut with a snap like a gigantic nut-cracker. His
dress was plain black, and his manners altogether unexceptionable.
His position as head of the Mormon
people has bred the habit of power, while his contact
with representative men from abroad has imparted much[Pg 178]
of the elegance and suaviter in modo of the man
of the world; so that he would pass for a pretty
good diplomat almost anywhere. To take Brigham
Young for a fool, or a mere fanatic, it was plain to be
seen, would be a great mistake. It is true, he knows
nothing about grammar or rhetoric, and but little about
the dictionary; but his knowledge of all the country there,
and of human nature, we found to be full and exact, and
no man west of the Rocky Mountains knows better how
make a good bargain, or fill a paying contract. However
illiterate, he has patience, shrewdness, cunning, and
abundance of hard common-sense       "horse-sense," as
we used to say of Grant in the army       and doubtless
would have made his way in the world, in whatever
sphere he happened to drop. If he had not become
"Brother Brigham," great hierarch of the Mormon
Church and autocrat of all Utah, worth $25,000,000 in
his own right, (as reported), owning countless lands and
herds, no doubt he would have gravitated into a first-class
hotel-keeper, or a money king on Wall Street, or a
great railroad-contractor, or something of that sort,
requiring keen perceptions and fine executive abilities.
To deny him some such qualities, is evidently preposterous.
Discredit him in every way; call him charlatan
and humbug, if you please; the fact still remains, that
he has changed an isolated desert into a land flowing
with milk and honey, and created a community of a
hundred thousand souls devoted to his will, holding their
lives and fortunes absolutely at his bidding       and surely
no mere imbecile, or blunderer, could have achieved such
results.


   
   
   BRIGHAM YOUNG.


We saw Brigham again, a few days afterwards, one night
at the theatre. The Salt Lake Theatre is really a fine building,
and very creditable to the city. Its scenery, and appointments[Pg 179]
generally, are unsurpassed in this country,
outside of a few of our great cities East, and but few of
our play-houses indeed equal it even there. Nearly everything
about it has been imported from England, at large
expense, and Englishmen in the main manage it now.
The play the night we were there was of the kind yclept
Moral Drama, but it was put on the stage with considerable
ability. Two "stars" from San Francisco took
the leading characters; the minor ones were sustained by
the stock-company, most of whom were Mormon residents
of Salt Lake. Among these a sprightly looking
girl of seventeen was pointed out to us, as a daughter of
Brigham Young's, though on the bills she bore a high-sounding
theatrical name. What corresponds to the
"pit" in most theatres, is their dress-circle, and this was
well-filled with families       chiefly women and children.
The rest of the theatre was occupied mostly by Gentiles
and soldiers. What impressed one particularly, was the
domestic or family character of the whole thing. Men,
women, and children, were all there, down to the last
baby, and young misses came and went at will, quite
unattended, as at church East. Between the acts, paterfamilias
and all munched their apples and nuts, and promenaded
about quite ad libitum; but during the performance
everything was very decorous. In the very centre
of the house were four long seats, handsomely upholstered,
and "reserved" for Mrs. Brigham Young. There were
"sixteen of her," as poor Artemus Ward used to say,
there that night, all ordinary looking women, apparently
from thirty-five to fifty years of age, and dressed rather
plainly. A fine large rocking-chair, abreast of the seats,
was pointed out to us as Brigham's place when he sits with
them. Ordinarily he occupies a private box, with his
favorite wife, and did so that evening with his dear[Pg 180]
Amelia. He paid but little attention to the play, but
most of the time was sweeping the audience with an
opera-glass, or conversing with a gentleman by his side.
Mrs. Amelia was well-dressed, but not richly, and was
scarcely better looking than the other sixteen, whom she
had displaced in Brigham's affections. Evidently the
Prophet has no taste for female beauty, or else is indifferent
to it. Sometimes, between the acts, he comes down
and chats a little with his domestic flock below, but
retires to his box again when the play resumes. That
evening, however, he continued faithful throughout to
Mrs. Amelia.

Flanking the stage were two long seats, upholstered
somewhat better than the rest, and here sat some twenty
or more of Brigham's children       of all sizes and both
sexes. They were mostly maidens from ten to fifteen
years of age, though some were only prattling infants on
their mothers' knees. They were better dressed and
brighter looking, than most of the young people present;
but the sight was a singular one for the nineteenth century,
and in Christian America. Altogether, Brigham
was said to have over fifty children       mostly girls.
Heber Kimball was credited with about the same number,
but his were chiefly boys       whereat he was inclined to
joke Brigham. Their wives so-called, were reported at
the same number, about twenty-five each. Recently
Brigham had said, that he had "about a dozen or twenty,
he was not certain which       it was nobody's business but
his own." But public opinion at Salt Lake credited him
with twenty-five or more, regular and "brevet" together,
when we were there; and he has probably increased the
number one or two per year, ever since.

Our main object, however, in going to the Theatre,
was to get a good look at the general audience. On the[Pg 181]
surface, I must say, this was genteel and respectable.
There was no fashion or "style" about it, of course;
but the people as a whole were well-dressed       always
comfortably       and in the main looked contented and well-to-do.
Here and there a woman's face however, showed,
unmistakable signs of grief and anguish; but there were
not nearly so many of these, as might be expected. What
the women's faces chiefly lacked, was that air of sprightliness
and grace, of culture and refinement, that characterizes
the majority of theatre-going ladies East and
elsewhere. There was an ugly subdued look about many
of them, as if they felt themselves trodden down and
inferior to the men       much such as we used to see in the
negro's face down South       and too little of that calm,
masterful, rounded equipoise of self-respect, which is the
true glory of either man or woman. Prolong polygamy
for a century, with all such downward forces constantly
at work, and what may not our Utah dames and damsels
become? The men, on the other hand, looked heavy and
coarse, and while there were keen sharp faces among them,
here and there, that could have belonged only to men of
character anywhere, yet in too many instances the animal
was evidently creeping over them, and in the end would
surely predominate. It was pitiful to think how inexorably
their higher nature must suffer, if polygamy continued,
unless all history is false, and physiology a lie. But
there are some things, that need not be said; it is enough
to intimate them.



[Pg 182]




CHAPTER XI.

MORMON OUTRAGES       POLYGAMY, ETC.


As to the alleged outrages and wrongs by Mormons
against Gentiles, we found public opinion at Salt
Lake much divided. The Mormons, as a class, of course,
all repudiated and denied them; while the Gentiles, as
a class, were equally earnest in affirming them. Before
arriving there, we were very skeptical on this subject;
but before leaving, and afterwards, heard so many ugly
stories, that we were compelled to believe somewhat in
them. It is a delicate subject to touch at all, and I
would fain avoid it; but no account of Salt Lake would
be complete without some allusion thereto. Space would
fail me to speak of them at length; so that I shall content
myself with recording only a case or two, and from
them the reader must judge for himself. The Mountain
Meadow massacre, and the Brassfield murder, were old
stories; but just previous to our arrival, a party of Gentiles
had been threatened with drowning in the Jordan,
and indeed, while we were there, the atrocious murder
of Dr. Robinson occurred. The editor of the little
Vidette, the plucky Gentile paper then at Salt Lake,
was one of the Gentiles above referred to, and his story
was that a band of masked men seized them on the street
one night, and taking them out to the Jordan tied them
hand and foot, and then gave them the option       either to
leave Utah in one week, or to be tossed in and drowned.[Pg 183]
Their only offence was, that they had been too bitter
against Mormonism, and Salt Lake they were informed
was "an unhealthy place" for such people. They all
agreed, we believe, to emigrate. But the Vidette man,
on getting home, concluded such a promise under duress
was not very binding, and proceeded to strengthen his
conclusion by securing a guard from Camp Douglas.
Loaded down with revolvers, he went about his business
as usual in the day time, but at night kept within doors,
and so far had remained unmolested. The others, however,
as a whole, thought it safer to keep their agreement,
and accordingly duly quitted Utah.

The murder of Dr. Robinson (Oct. 22d), it must be
admitted, was a cold-blooded atrocity, worthy only of
fanatics or savages. He had come to Salt Lake originally,
as Surgeon or Ass't-Surgeon of a regiment of volunteers,
ordered there from California during the war, to
replace the Regulars sent east. When his regiment was
mustered out, he concluded to settle at Salt Lake, and
soon after "pre-empted" the quarter-section containing
the Hot Sulphur Springs. Associating a Dr. Williamson
with him, who had also been in the army, they put up a
bath-house and refreshment-saloon at the Springs, and by
liberal advertising were soon in a fair way to make some
money. Now, all at once, two Mormons living near suddenly
discovered that the property belonged to them,
although they had never claimed it before, or regularly
"pre-empted" it, or made any "permanent improvement"
there, as required by our pre-emption laws. They
accordingly brought suit in ejectment against Messrs.
Robinson and Williamson, in the U. S. District Court
there; but before the cause reached trial, became convinced
there was nothing in their case, and concluded to
abandon it. Now, however, Salt Lake City itself stepped[Pg 184]
in as plaintiff in the cause, and claimed the Springs
also as corporation property, by virtue of some old ordinance,
though two or three miles beyond the city
limits. Immediately, without waiting for the Court,
Messrs. R. and W. were declared trespassers, and the
Mayor ordered the city police to eject them from
the premises, which was done one night by tearing down
the buildings over their heads, and dragging them both
off bodily. This summary proceeding, no better than a
riot, naturally created much excitement among the Gentiles,
and was still being talked of when we reached Salt
Lake. Meanwhile, Dr. Robinson took it very coolly, and
moving into Salt Lake, opened an office for practice
there, proposing to abide the judgment of the Court.
Shortly, however, before this could be reached, he was
roused up one night by a man at his door, with the
plausible story, that a friend down the street had broken
his leg and needed his immediate services, being already
in great agony. His wife, newly married, fearing treachery,
begged him not to go. But the Doctor felt bound
by the vows of his profession, and while proceeding
forth upon this supposed errand of mercy and benevolence,
he was waylaid on one of the most public streets,
knocked down, and shot through the head, three or four
times, as if his assassins meant to make sure work of
their victim. From the testimony of those awakened by
the shots and his loud outcries, it appeared there were
over a half a dozen of his assassins and their accessories       some
doing the bloody work, while others stood guard
on the adjacent corners       and yet not one of them was
arrested, though it was a bright moonlight night, and a
fresh fall of snow on the ground. The city police, when
sought, were all found collected at the Central Police
Station, as if purposely out of the way, and no serious or[Pg 185]
concerted attempt was made to track the murderers.
His watch was untouched; his pockets, unrifled; there
was no evidence that he had a personal enemy; and the
almost universal conviction of the Gentiles then at Salt
Lake was, that he had fallen a victim to the Mormons, at
the bidding or instigation of the Church       they preferring
to end their action of ejectment thus summarily, rather
than abide "the law's delay," or its "glorious uncertainties."
Subsequently, a leading Mormon, a son-in-law
of Brigham Young's, admitted to me, indeed, that Robinson
had probably been "silenced" by some ignorant or
bigoted brother; but repudiated, of course, all connection
of the Church therewith, or responsibility therefor.

The morning after the assassination, as the facts
got known, the Gentile population became greatly excited,
and for a day or two there was hot talk of a "Vigilance
Committee," etc. Happily, however, this last suggestion
was abandoned, or the Mormons would have exterminated
them, as they outnumbered the Gentiles fully six to
one in the city, and immensely more than that outside
in the Territory. To pacify them, however, a coroner's
inquest was ordered, and, as the excitement grew, the
City Government came out ostentatiously with a reward of
$2,000, for the apprehension and conviction of the murderers.
So intense was the feeling, Brigham Young
himself thought it wise to start a private subscription, and
raised $7,000 more among the Mormon merchants and
"tender-footed" Gentiles. The sturdier Gentiles, however,
and many of the U. S. officials, refused to have any
thing to do with this; and one, at least, of the U. S.
Judges, when asked to sign it, unhesitatingly branded
the whole movement, as only "a cheat and swindle to
throw dust into the eyes of people East." It was, however,
a shrewd dodge, worthy of such an old fox, and[Pg 186]
Brigham immediately telegraphed to Gen. Sherman, at
St. Louis, then commanding that Department, "We
have offered $9,000 reward for Dr. Robinson's murderers.
The church nothing to do with it!" No doubt,
when interrogated by tourists about such outrages and
wrongs hereafter, he will refer to that "$9,000 reward,"
for many a day, with great unction, and extol his saints
to the skies accordingly. Of course, it was perfectly safe
to "subscribe" it; for it was never meant, that any
body should be caught. The coroner's inquest made a
show of sitting several days, but nothing came of their
labors. Some Gentiles, indeed, went so far as to retain
Ex-Gov. Weller, of California, who happened then to
be at Salt Lake, and he prosecuted the inquiry with
some vigor; but the verdict of the jury was, "Killed by
some person or persons unknown." The effect of it all
was, to deepen the sense of insecurity in the minds of all
Gentiles there, as to both person and property, and to
intensify the general feeling against Mormonism, which
we found everywhere throughout Colorado, Idaho, Oregon,
Nevada, and the Pacific Coast generally. It became
at once another wall of division, another root of bitterness,
between Gentiles and Mormons throughout all that
region; and will be sure to be treasured up "as wrath
against a day of wrath," when that dark day comes. And
justice, against even Brighamdom, we may depend, will
not sleep forever.

Mrs. Robinson, it should be added, subsequently
returned to her friends in California, and Dr. Williamson
left for the East, both abandoning their undoubted property,
after such convincing arguments. The City immediately
leased the Springs and their appurtenances for
$2,000 per year; and thus this cruel assassination was[Pg 187]
apparently a "paying" operation for the Saints, whatever
may be its barbarism, or however others fared.

This case I have given somewhat in detail, because it
occurred under my own eye       so to speak       and I endeavored
to sift its facts pretty thoroughly for myself. In
my Official Report on Utah, attention was called to it; and
whatever else may be said or thought of it, one thing
seems clear, to wit, that such unlawful and wicked acts
are but the logical fruit of the habitual teachings of the
Mormon chiefs and leaders. Said Brigham Young some
time before, in one of his pulpit discourses, "Brethren,
if any body comes here, and goes to interfere with our
lands or women, my advice is to send 'em to hell across
lots." Said the editor of the Salt Lake Telegraph, the
chief Mormon paper there, one day in my hearing, "If a
man comes here, and don't like our institutions, all he
has to do is to leave. If he stops here, and minds his own
business, he will get along well enough       nobody will
molest him. But if he goes to denouncing President
Young, or interfering with our domestic relations, of
course he will get into trouble mighty quick, you bet!"
I thought that a fair statement of their position; but
failed to see wherein it differed from the hideous despotism
down South, which we had just had to break as with
a rod of iron, and dash in pieces as a potter's vessel. He
indignantly denied, that Gentiles were ordinarily ill-treated
or tabooed; but his own statement, it seemed to
me, confessed away the whole case substantially of Gentile
vs. Mormon, involving as it does a thorough surrender
of our cherished freedom of speech and of the press.
This editor was a bluff and hearty Englishman, about
forty years of age, and was reported engaged to a daughter
of Brigham Young's, only about seventeen. The current
criticism of him was, that he really believed no more[Pg 188]
in Mormonism, than the most incorrigible Gentile; but
he had found the institution, or rather "destitution," (as
Theodore Parker called its "twin relic," and would much
more have branded it), to "pay," and so eulogized and
defended it.

Perhaps I can not do better, than relate just here a
rather remarkable conversation I had with a high judicial
officer of the Territory, on this and kindred subjects.
He had been there several years, was a man of ability and
character, and I give the conversation at length, because
it seemed trustworthy, and also because it will probably
answer a variety of questions the reader may want to ask.
It took place in his own chambers, while I was at Salt
Lake; and as no injunction of secrecy was imposed, or
apparently desired, I see no objections to publishing it.
He said he had come to Utah unprejudiced against the
Mormons, but at length had become convinced, however
reluctantly, that they had a secret organization       call it
"Thugs," "Danites," "Destroying Angels," or what you
will       whose sworn duty it was to "put out of the way"
any person, who became hostile or obnoxious to their
views or interests. For a long while after coming there,
he had refused to credit this; but at length was compelled
to, by the most indubitable evidence, to wit, his own
multiplied observations and experiences as a U. S. judge.
He continued:

"I can't help believing, sir, that poor Dr. Robinson
was killed in this way, and when Brigham Young's
hypocritical subscription-paper, for a reward for the
arrest of the assassins, was presented for my signature,
I indignantly spurned it. I told the committee in charge,
that it was only another of Brigham's tricks to throw
dust into the eyes of the people at Washington, and I
would have nothing to do with it."

[Pg 189]

"Do you think his murderers will ever be discovered?"

"Suppose they are, they will never be convicted.
No Mormon jury would convict a brother Mormon, in
such a case, even if indicted, as everybody knows here.
I know very well who murdered poor Brassfield some
time ago, and where the Church sent him abroad to keep
him out of the way. I suppose England would return
him, under our extradition laws, if requested. But
cui bono? Our juries here are all summoned by the
Mormon sheriffs, and the jurors, of course, are either
Mormons, or dough-face Gentiles, worse than Mormons;
so that, it would be hopeless to expect a righteous
verdict."

"Then you really think, the accounts we get East of
outrages and crimes by Mormons, against Gentiles or
apostate Mormons, are, on the whole, true?"

"Why, yes, I am sorry to say, I fear so       the most
of them       as true as holy writ. But the half of them
never come to light. 'Dead men tell no tales.' And
what do we know of the mysteries and miseries of their
barbarous polygamy?"

"Do you think Brigham Young has much to do with
such outrages?"

"In some cases, yes, directly. In others, only
indirectly, by his sermons and addresses. No doubt he
advised, or at least suggested, the 'taking off' of Brassfield
and Dr. Robinson, to save trouble and serve as
examples. So, also, he was directly responsible for the
Mountain Meadow massacre, that occurred several years
ago, when a whole train of Gentile emigrants, en route
to California, were murdered in cold blood, and their
property and little children distributed around among
the Mormons. They had offended the Saints while[Pg 190]
passing through Salt Lake, and this was their revenge.
This murder by wholesale they have always charged
upon the Indians; but I myself have seen the secret
orders for their massacre, signed 'By order of President
Young, D. H. Wells, Adj't.-Gen.' I was in Washington
in the autumn of 1865, and was at the White-House
one day, when these orders were shown to Andrew
Johnson. He took the tattered and discolored papers to
the window, scanned them closely for awhile, and when
he returned them said, with much feeling, it was "high
time something was done to clean out such scoundrels."
It was a generous impulse, while it lasted, and he meant
it, too. But subsequently, when I saw him again, in the
winter, he had become embroiled with Congress, and
dismissed the Utah question with the curt remark, that
there was "practical polygamy in Massachusetts too, as
well as Utah." The property of these Mountain
Meadow emigrants, I repeat, was divided up, and
distributed around among the Mormons. Some of their
furniture is in Salt Lake now, and can readily be identified.
Many of their mules were sold by Capt. H.       subsequently
our delegate to Congress       to the U. S.
Quartermaster then here, and the proceeds shared by
himself, Young, Wells, and others. There is plenty of
evidence of all this, that I can put my finger on at any
time; but it would be ridiculous to submit it to a Mormon
jury, with any hope of a conviction now. And so,
the case rests."

"I suppose, this also is why our anti-polygamy laws
prove to be a failure?"

"Certainly, sir! It is an old adage, 'Dog won't eat
dog!' There didn't use to be much polygamy here.
But as soon as Congress made it a misdemeanor and a
crime, Brigham and his Bishops set to work to get as[Pg 191]
many of their people into it as possible, so as to make the
enforcement of the new law difficult, if not well nigh
impracticable. They argued very shrewdly, 'You can't
indict and try a whole people.' Polygamy, indeed, used
to be only a matter of taste, and but little talked about;
but now it is constantly preached, as a civil and religious
duty, and all who can support more than one wife are
proceeding to take others. The women objected a good
deal, at first, and do still; but they were told, it was a
New Revelation, 'thus saith the Lord,' and submission
would make them 'Queens in Heaven' etc., and so they
yielded. What else could they do in these mountain
fastnesses, with Gown and Sword both against them?"

"Well, judge, you must have seen a good deal of
the 'peculiar institution.' What are its practical
workings?"

"Bad, and only bad       every way. It tends to make
the men petty despots and mere animals, of course, while
it degrades American women to the level of the Oriental
harem. Their husbands, so-called, already habitually
think and speak of them, as their 'women'       not wives       as
you may have noticed, as a part of their goodly possessions,
somewhat more esteemed perhaps than their flocks and
herds, but not so much more either. Affection, sympathy,
confidence       the finer instincts and feelings       all true
delicacy between husband and wife       are fast dying out,
and we have nothing half so good to show for them.
Sometimes, however, a first wife gets the bit into her
teeth, and then the others have to stand around, or leave.
Per contra, sometimes the first wife herself gets ejected.
One of Heber Kimball's sons married a second wife some
time ago, and soon after she persuaded his first wife       a
wife of many years, with several children       to vacate, by
three shots from a revolver, and then installed herself as[Pg 192]
first wife instead! No doubt, the Saints have many
a little "unpleasantness," like this, to mar their domestic
felicity; but they hush them up, and keep quiet
about it."

"What about their polygamous children?"

"Why, they are inferior of course, in many ways, ex
necessitate, as the fruits of such a practice always are,
and must be. Go to the City Cemetery, and you will
find it a perfect Golgotha of infant graves. If not feeble
and tainted already in constitution, they must speedily
become so; or else all History is false, and Science a
slander."

"And yet those we have seen on the road, and about
the streets here, seem bright and spry enough."

"No doubt. It is a good climate, and there has not
been time enough yet. But, then, have you considered the
whole foul brood of downward influences at work here, and
what must be the logical result in due season, by the very
nature of things? Why, with our population of a hundred
thousand souls, we have not a Free School yet in all
Utah, and outside of this city scarcely a School-House.
Here, we have a few Ward Schools; but the teachers are
inferior, and the rates of tuition, cost of books etc., so
high, that only the children of the better classes can
attend. Brigham Young has a school of his own, in his
seraglio grounds, where his numerous progeny are taught
music, dancing, and some of the commoner branches; but
the great bulk of our rising generation here are growing
up in a state of ignorance and superstition so dense, as to
be absolutely inconceivable elsewhere. So, too, many of
the Saints have two or more sisters for wives, at the same
time. Others, again, marry their own blood-cousins, and
some even their own step-daughters. And instances
exist, where they have had mother and daughter for[Pg 193]
wives, at the same time. Now, where all this is to end,
it seems to me, it is not difficult to predict, unless Nature
suspends her laws, and Evil becomes our Good."

"It is certainly very shocking, judge. But what do
you propose to do about it?"

"Well, I would do something, or at least try to.
I have thought a good deal about it, since I got my eyes
open; and, first of all, I would have Congress authorize
and instruct the U. S. Marshal here to summon the jurors
for the U. S. Courts direct. By some strange oversight,
I suspect by Mormon intrigue (for they watch Congress
closely, and boast they control it on all Utah matters
usually), this was omitted in our Organic Act, and
consequently our jury-lists are now taken from the
county-lists, which are of course made up by Mormon
sheriffs. Therefore, all open and avowed Gentiles, who
have any back-bone in them, are left off, and we get
nobody in our U. S. jury-boxes even, except Mormons and
doughface Gentiles. Of course, such juries won't indict
or convict for polygamy, or any other offence worth mentioning,
if a Mormon is to be mulcted for it. But if our
jurors were summoned by our Marshal direct, out of the
whole body of the Territory, as they are everywhere else, I
believe, he could take good care to put only reliable
citizens on the lists, and thus give us juries that would
indict and convict in all necessary or flagrant cases."[10]
[Pg 194]
"But would the Saints meekly consent to be thus
overslaughed, and ignored?"

"Of course, not! The first verdict we got and attempted
to enforce, there would be a riot, or threatened riot, and
then we would have to fall back on the Military. The
Utah Militia, of course, could not be depended on; for it is
all officered and controlled by the creatures of the Church.
Therefore, we would have to call on the United States,
and it would be for Uncle Sam to decide at last. This,
of course, would necessitate an increase of troops here;
for, if the garrison were small, the Saints might make
trouble. But give us a couple of batteries, a regiment
of cavalry, and say two regiments of infantry, such as
Sherman 'went marching through Georgia' with; and
Brighamdom can be made to obey the laws, the same as
Dixie, or be ground to powder."

"But, judge, will not the Pacific Railroad solve the
problem in a more excellent way       peaceably and quietly       by
bringing in such an influx of Gentiles, that Mormonism
will be neutralized? This is what we all hope
East?"

"Perhaps so, if this 'influx' is big enough, and good
enough. But, you see, the Saints claim to have pre-empted
about all the land here, that is worth anything,
and they won't sell or lease to Gentiles, unless the Church
says so. Besides, with the heavy immigration the Mormons
are constantly receiving       about three thousand
this year, to next to nothing by the Gentiles, and their
naturally rapid increase, I fear they will keep greatly
ahead of all outsiders, who won't be likely to come and
stay long where they will be ostracised and outlawed. It
isn't natural, that they should. Won't it be the same, as
it was down South before the war, and has been ever
since? Northern brain and capital wouldn't go there,[Pg 195]
and won't, because they believe in perfect freedom of
speech and of the press       absolute security of person and
property       and won't settle where these are wanting.
How then can we expect them to emigrate here, where
we have no true enjoyment of either? What sensible
man would come to Utah, or bring his wife and children
here, when he could go just as well to Colorado or Montana,
Oregon or California, and escape the dismal drawbacks
we have here? I admit I have great hopes of the
Railroad, in time; and yet I confess, I fear, our questio
vexata here in Utah, like its "twin" question down in
Dixie, will find its solution only in gunpowder, if it is
to find it soon. When nothing else will do, I have great
faith in the moral power of bayonets       especially, when
used on the right side."

"But, judge, is not Brigham Young the main cohesive
power; and when he dies, what then?"

"Well, when that happens they may split up, on the
question of his successor; but I suspect Brigham is too
shrewd and far-seeing for that. He already has Brigham
Young, Jr., his smartest son, in training for the succession       sent
him missionary to England, and now he is a
Brigadier-General in the Mormon Militia here       and the
probability is, a "Revelation" will designate him for the
Presidency, if death don't come too suddenly. Brigham
will undoubtedly keep the succession in his own family,
if he can; but he will not hesitate a moment to designate
some other person, if the seeming interests of the Church
require it. Of course, he is very illiterate; but he is a
very able and sagacious man, for all that       devoted to
Mormonism, and "dangerous" in every sense of that
word."

"Have you no fear of him, yourself, judge? You
speak your mind pretty plainly."

[Pg 196]

"No, I think not. He would hardly strike so high.
Besides he is reputed to be a coward, personally, and I
guess that is so. I have seen him charged with complicity
in the Mountain Meadow massacre, and his shirking
and cringing then was pitiful. No doubt, my life is
always in danger here, more or less, as would be that of
any other upright and fearless judge. Indeed, I have
good reason to know, that they cordially hate me. After
Dr. Robinson's assassination a friendly Mormon came to
me at night, and told me confidentially my turn would
come next. But I keep indoors after dark, or else go out
only in company, or when heavily armed, and am prepared
to sacrifice my life, if need be, at any time. I have
lived too long in this world, to be much afraid of leaving
it; and I don't know as I could die better anyhow, than
in upholding and enforcing the laws of my country here
in Utah."

"Do your Courts ever meet with real opposition to
their ordinary courses of procedure?"

"Why, no       not formally; though I never have much
confidence in a verdict, where one of the parties is a
Gentile. Where plaintiff and defendant are both Mormons,
our verdicts are usually righteous enough; though
these are liable to be overruled or set aside, by the High
Council of the Church       a body of irresponsible ecclesiastics,
of course, unknown to the laws. This Council is
composed of Brigham Young, and a number of the chief
dignitaries of the Church, and is often appealed to by
"big" Mormons, when the civil courts have gone against
them."

"No! Really? But is not this mere rumor, judge?"

"No, indeed! I could cite several such cases, but
will only trouble you with one. Not long ago, down in
one of our Southern counties, a laboring man       a Mormon       was[Pg 197]
working in a barn, for and with a Mormon
Bishop. In some way or other, they got into a quarrel,
which ended in a fight, and in the course of this the
Bishop hurt the poor fellow very badly. Among other
things, he struck him with a pitchfork, harpooning him       so
to speak       through the leg, so that the poor man
was laid up for months, and made a cripple indeed for
life. After his recovery, the outrage was so atrocious,
and the community so generally with him, he mustered
up courage enough to bring an action against the Bishop.
The cause was tried in the Probate or County Court,
where of course, all were Mormons. But the jurors,
being neighbors of the injured man and cognizant of all
the facts, resolved to do justice, and accordingly without
much delay returned a verdict for $3,500 damages. The
Bishop being rich, as the high dignitaries all are, appealed
the case to my court, where I, after a full hearing, of
course, affirmed the judgment of the court below, with
heavy costs.

"Well, now, I supposed this settled the case, as
there was no higher court here. But judge of my
astonishment, when some weeks after the plaintiff came
to me one day, and said the Bishop had further appealed
the case to the High Council of the Church, where they
had tried it over again, and awarded him only $1,000
damages; and he wanted to know if this was right and
"good law" here? Of course, I could do nothing for
him myself, with the facts in that shape. But I referred
him to one of our Gentile lawyers here, and told him if
he would put the case in his hands, and have the facts
brought regularly before me, so that I could get hold of
the matter judicially, I would soon teach this "High
Council of the Church" a lesson, as to their rights and
duties, as against a United States Court, that they would[Pg 198]
be apt to remember for awhile. He thanked me, and
took my advice. But before the papers got regularly
before me, the Mormons somehow got wind of the matter,
and hastened to settle with the man. I believe they
gave him $2,000, or something like that, and I suppose
frightened him into silence. Now, to think once of
these insolent villians, presuming       without law and in
violation of law       to review and overrule the solemn
decision of a United States Court! I tell you, it made
my Quaker blood boil, when I heard of it.[11] I would
just like to have laid my hands on that "High Council
of the Church," in a case like that. I feel right sure, I
would have taught Brigham Young and his lawless
associates a wholesome lesson, they wouldn't have forgotten
very soon, if it had cost me my life to do it."

There was something grand and heroic       almost
sublime       about this man's talk at times, and I only
reproduce it here very faintly. He knew I was
seeking official facts, and doubtless unburdened his
whole soul to me. He had had unusual opportunities
for observation; he seemed to be well-informed; and
certainly was thoroughly honest. Further than this, I
cannot vouch for him, but report the conversation substantially
as it occurred, from notes made the same evening.
I must, however, do him the justice to add, that
his views in the main were everywhere corroborated by
almost all the Federal officers I met       both civil and military       as
well as the vast majority of Gentile settlers,
throughout all that region. Such were the views of
Judge              ; and subsequent events there, it must be confessed,
have pretty well illustrated them.


[Pg 199]



CHAPTER XII.

MORMONISM IN GENERAL.


In the two previous chapters, I have discussed Utah
pretty thoroughly, touching most of the mooted questions
there; and now, to sum up. Without doubt, it
must be said of the people of Utah, that they are an industrious,
frugal, and thrifty race. By their wonderful system
of irrigation, they have converted the desert there
into a garden, and literally made the wilderness, "bloom
and blossom as the rose." Their statistics (1866) showed,
that they had already constructed over a thousand miles
of irrigating canals and ditches, watering 150,000 acres
of land, at a cost of nearly $2,000,000. Each family has
its own few acres, and these are cultivated so thoroughly,
that the total annual product is surprising. In Salt Lake
City many families almost live on their acre-and-a-quarter
lots, and many of their farms elsewhere do not
exceed forty or fifty acres, with many much smaller.
With their system of careful culture and general double-cropping,
one man cannot well manage over ten or twelve
acres per year; nor is more necessary for an ordinary
family, the land proves so bountiful. Fifty and sixty
bushels of wheat per acre, we were told, was not an unusual
yield. So, since leaving the Missouri, we had nowhere
seen more comfortable and apparently well-to-do homes.
We must say, they were much superior to the average
homes of our people in Colorado. Evidently, these[Pg 200]
Utahans had come there to stay, and from the first had
"governed themselves accordingly;" while the Coloradoans,
it was plain, were too many of them, only "birds
of passage," like so much of our population in the West
generally. Their towns and villages are well laid out,
and in the main neatly built. In the country, their little
farms are well-fenced or walled, with comfortable adobe
houses clustering with vines and flowers, or surrounded
with fruit and shade trees, while a throng of hay and
grain-stacks encircle their barns. So, too, the Mormons,
whatever else may be said of them, are certainly a sober
race of people. Many of them no doubt keep liquor
about their premises, and drink when they choose to;
but drunkenness as a vice, or habitual drinking as a
practice, is unknown in Utah, comparatively speaking.
So, too, they allow no gambling there, except "on the
sly;" and no houses of prostitution, unless you regard
every "much-married" Mormon's as such, which it
seems hardly fair to do       the women considered. On the
whole, it is safe to say, that the Mormons deserve marked
commendation and praise for what they have accomplished
in Utah, in redeeming a barren wilderness and building
up a prosperous community there, and full credit
should be awarded them accordingly. They brag constantly,
and largely, about Great Salt Lake City, and
surely they have a right to. In the essential points of
beauty, comfort, cleanliness, and good order, it has few
equals, and perhaps no superiors of its age and size anywhere,
and all things considered is indeed a perfect miracle
for Utah. In the very heart of the great internal
basin of the continent, and the centre of a busy and thriving
people, it really seemed to be a natural metropolis
there, and was everywhere talked of as the future workshop
and mart of that region.

[Pg 201]

On the other hand, it is due to truth to say, that
impartial as I tried to be, the more I studied affairs
there, the more Mormonism impressed me as, in many
respects, a huge mass of thorough iniquity. It did not
strike me as a Religion at all, per se, and I suspect there
is less of the purely "religious" about it, than any other
ecclesiastical organization on the earth. Their sermons
were not so much theological discourses, as they were
sectarian stump-speeches. The whole Church, "so-called,"
struck me ordinarily, as a coarse utilitarianism,
not to say rude materialism. Their missionaries seemed
to be sent out, not so much to spread the gospel (even
according to J. Smith and B. Young), as to induce and
hasten immigration to Utah. It is true, they have Bishops
and other subordinate clergy; but their main duty
appeared to be to preside over and direct colonization,
rather than to cure souls. They had indeed their regular
dioceses; but these were so arranged as to make the
Bishop the chief man in each town or settlement, and
judging by those we saw these dignitaries were selected
rather for their shrewd business talents, than any special
piety or virtue. They were almost invariably sharp smart
Americans, while the great majority of the Mormons
were English, Welsh, Danes, etc., of the very lowest and
poorest classes. In every community, the Bishop's word
was law and gospel, as he claimed to receive "revelations"
direct from heaven on most knotty questions, and
he virtually inspired and directed all its business. Usually
he owned the mill, store, and hotel, and he who controls
these three essentials of a new community ordinarily
controls the community itself. Observation shows, that
nearly everybody in a new country becomes mortgaged,
sooner or later, to the miller, store-keeper, or hotel-keeper;
and hence as the Bishops are all three of these in one,[Pg 202]
their chances for amassing wealth are simply enormous.
The result is, that all or nearly all of the Mormon Bishops
have become immensely rich, while Brigham himself is
reported worth a fabulous amount in his own right, independently
of the vast property he holds, as "Trustee in
trust for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints."[12]
Indeed, to sum it up in one word, the whole institution
of Mormonism       polygamy and all       apart from its theological
aspects, impresses you rather as a gigantic organization
for collecting and consolidating a population, and
thus settling up a Territory rapidly, whatever else it may
be; and its success, in this respect, has certainly been
notable and great.

As a whole, the Mormons are no doubt a very ignorant,
and, therefore, very bigoted people, and the whole
tendency of their pulpit-teachings is to lawlessness and
violence, so far as Gentiles are concerned. They affect to
despise mere intellect and sentiment, and to pride themselves
on being plain-spoken and practical. They will
not "fellowship" with open and avowed Gentiles, if they
can avoid it; and boldly proclaim their hostility to and
contempt for the Government of the United States, as on
the Sunday we were at their Tabernacle. No doubt, if
opportunity offered, they would assail or embarrass it,
though now they are more wary and circumspect, than
they were before the South learned a lesson on this score.
So, Brigham Young is governor de facto in Utah, and
has been always, no matter who is governor de jure, and
will be, while that other "twin relic of barbarism," polygamy,
endures. The evidence on all these points, I must
say, seemed fairly overwhelming, though no more can
be given here. So, too, they believe, or affect to believe,[Pg 203]
that the United States dares not touch their "peculiar
institution," and brand all our laws against it as acts of
"National wickedness," "Federal tyranny," invasions
of their "sacred rights," etc. It seemed to me, that we
had heard such complaints before; but not from a part of
the country, that led us to respect them greatly, when
reiterated there in Utah. The true test is, what are the
results to Humanity, and how do they affect us as a
People? And I am sure, the answer in all candor must
be, a bigoted and seditious race of men, a degraded and
inferior class of women, an ignorant and degenerate herd
of children; and does not the inevitable, and inexorable,
logic of things necessitate just these? If these be the
elements of progress and the seeds of empire, then Utah
should be let alone; if otherwise, then let us lay the
strong hand of the Government upon her, and teach her
respect for and obedience to the laws, the same as all
other parts of the Union.

No doubt their poor women are already relapsing into a
condition, that is truly pitiable, as elsewhere intimated, and
their tendency must be rapidly to the worse. Evidently
the Saints take care to seclude them from Gentile gaze,
as much as possible; but a more dreary, homely, pokey
set of women, as a whole, were never seen. I may have
been unfortunate, but in all Utah, I did not see a truly
happy and sunny countenance, or noble and serene, on a
mature Mormon woman; nor did I anywhere hear of
one, who would fully realize our old and fond ideal of


"A perfect woman nobly planned,
To warn, to comfort, and command;
And yet a spirit       still and bright       
With something of an angel's light!"


But, what else could be expected in a country, where
a husband signifies only the fractional part of a man,[Pg 204]
and a wife       any number of women you please? Beyond
controversy, their "peculiar institution" of polygamy
is a "relic of barbarism"       yea, verily, a "twin-relic"
to slavery       as the Republican party in 1856-60 had the
manliness and courage to pronounce it. "Peculiar" institutions,
of whatever character, have no business in a
republic; they mean inequality, and inevitably tend to
violence and disorder. No doubt, had Abraham Lincoln
lived, when we had finished our first "twin" right
thoroughly, he would have found a way to look well
after the other. We owe this to our mothers and sisters,
to our wives and daughters,


"The graces and the loves, that make
The music of the march of life       "


to all of womankind, the broad continent across and
the wide world over; and Congress should take care, that
we lend not the sanction of our flag to this hideous crime,
an hour longer than we must. Our age, so far, has largely
honored itself, in honoring and respecting womankind, and
it is too late now to let Christian America barbarize any
portion of herself, with the exploded savagery of pagandom.
We must have freedom of speech and of the
press there, security of person and property       absolute
and perfect       the same as in New York or Massachusetts,
or our flag is a lie. We must maintain and execute
our national laws against polygamy, the same as everywhere
else, no matter who opposes, or our government
is a sham. And if Mormon juries won't do this, refusing
to indict or convict, and nothing else will do, so that we
have to fall back on the bayonet, why then I see nothing
in Utah so sacred, that we should not give Brighamdom
the bayonet, the same as we did Jeffdom. I believe in
the Pacific Railroad, and hope much from its civilizing and[Pg 205]
refining influences; I have great faith in the locomotive
and the telegraph; but I also believe, with Judge                in
"the moral power of bayonets, when nothing else will
suffice       especially when used on the right side." We
have just had to use them against one "twin-relic," when
nothing else would do, in spite of our Railroads there;
now let them charge down upon the other, if Utah will
not obey the laws, and that right speedily. Were
Mormonism merely a religion, as a republic we should
be the last to touch it. But polygamy, its baleful flower
and fruit, and the source of all Utah's woes, is an unmitigated
barbarism; an outrage and crime, not only against
woman, but humanity; an organized insult to the Christianity
and civilization of the age; and we Americans, of
this generation, owe it to ourselves and to history, to end
it       to stamp it out if need be       sans ceremony and
instanter. Let us not dally with it, as we did with Southern
slavery. Else may God, in his just wrath, break us
again with a rod of iron, or haply dash us in pieces as a
potter's vessel. Let Congress and the President but do their
duty in the premises, and Brigham Young I predict will
receive a "new revelation," that will quickly end the
whole trouble. The power is with them, and History
will hold them justly responsible.



[Pg 206]




CHAPTER XIII.

SALT LAKE TO BOISÈ CITY, IDAHO.


It was our intention originally to proceed from Salt
Lake to San Francisco direct, via Nevada; but our long
sojourn at Salt Lake induced us to go via Boisè City and
the Columbia instead. When arranging for our departure,
we happened to meet Mr. Ben Holliday, the great
stage-proprietor of the Plains there, and he advised us
to inspect Idaho first, or we would be caught there in
winter. He was then temporarily at Salt Lake, on one
of his semi-annual inspections of his vast stage-lines.
The Pacific Railroad has supplanted these now, in the
main; but they were then the only means of rapid
transit, and a great and important agency of civilization
throughout all that region. His line of stages commenced
then at Fort Kearney on the Platte, and ran
thence to Denver, about five hundred miles; thence to
Central City, in the heart of the Colorado mines, about
forty miles; returning to Denver, thence along and
across the Rocky and Wahsatch Mountains to Salt Lake,
about six hundred miles; thence through Idaho and
Oregon, to Umatilla on the Columbia, about seven
hundred miles, with a branch at Bear River, through
Montana to Virginia City, about four hundred miles
more. In all, his stage-lines then footed up about two
thousand two hundred and forty miles, through the
great frontier heart of the continent. From Kearney to[Pg 207]
Salt Lake, he ran a daily stage each way; over the
balance of his routes, only a tri-weekly. From Salt Lake
to California, about seven hundred and fifty miles more,
there was also a daily stage each way, but this line was
owned and run by Wells, Fargo       Co., then and still the
great Express Company of the Pacific Coast. Mr. Holliday,
in anticipation of the Railroad, with his wonted
sagacity, was just completing the sale and transfer of all
his stage-lines to Wells, Fargo       Co., whose stage-business
alone thus became one gigantic enterprise,
reaching from the Missouri to the Pacific, and from Salt
Lake to the Columbia. What a prodigious undertaking!
How colossal in its proportions! It was estimated that
these lines would then foot up over three thousand miles,
and to operate them would require about five hundred
coaches, and fully ten thousand horses and mules, first
and last. Mr. Holliday said his lines had been very
profitable some years, but in others again he had lost
heavily. Sometimes the Indians stole or destroyed a
quarter of a million's worth of his property per annum,
and then again his expenses were always necessarily
enormous. Stations had to be erected and maintained,
ten or fifteen miles apart, along all the routes. Grain
had to be hauled, in the main, from either the Missouri
or Salt Lake, although Colorado and Idaho had begun
to yield something. Hay had to be transported often
fifty miles, and fuel sometimes a hundred and fifty. He
paid his General Superintendent ten thousand dollars per
year, and his Washington Agent about the same; his
Division Superintendents about half that sum; his
drivers and station-keepers from seventy-five to a hundred
dollars per month and their board; and then there were
ten thousand and one incidental expenses besides. One
would have supposed, that the oversight and management[Pg 208]
of his vast stage-enterprises would have been enough for
one man to carry. But, in addition, he owned and ran
a line of steam-ships on the Pacific from San Francisco
to Oregon and Alaska, another to Lower California and
Mexico, and was planning to get more business still.
He was a man apparently of about forty-five, tall and thin,
of large grasp and quick perceptions, of indifferent health
but indomitable will, fiery and irascible when crossed, and
a Westerner all through. Apparently he carried his vast
business very jauntily, without much thought or care; but
he crossed the continent twice each year, from end to end
of his stage-routes, and saw for himself how matters
were getting on. When he went through thus, extra
teams and coaches were always held in readiness, and he
had made the quickest Overland trip recorded. Time
was everything with him then; horse-flesh and expense       nothing.
Once he drove from Salt Lake to the
Missouri, over twelve hundred miles, in six days and a
half, and made the total trip from San Francisco in
twelve days. The locomotive beats this now, but nothing
else could. The usual schedule-time was about twenty
days; but it often took two or three more.

Mr. Holladay, however, was beginning to show signs
of his hard work, and on this trip had found it necessary
to bring his physician along with him. Subsequently, we
met him in San Francisco, still an invalid, but as hard at
work as ever, and there seemed to be no end to his teeming
schemes. Of course, we found these great stage-lines
not always popular, because they were rapacious
monopolies, ex necessitate. Nevertheless, on the whole,
they accomplished a great work in their day; and, all
things considered, did it cheaply and well. They have
a history of their own, full of incident and adventure,
that will read like romance a few years hence; and the[Pg 209]
man who will gather up all the facts, and give us a full
account of them, will do the future a real service.
Now, if ever, is the time to do this; for the Railroad
has already done away with the main lines, and soon
over all our American stage-coaching will be written
"Ichabod"       its glory has departed.

Mr. Halsey, Mr. Holladay's general superintendent at
Salt Lake, was about going to Boisè City to look after
stage-affairs generally, and politely invited us to share
his special coach. I was still feeble, and it was some
days before I could leave; but finally Nov. 7th, we
bade good-bye to Camp Douglas and Salt Lake, and
were off for the Columbia. Once out of the city, our
route struck due north, and skirted the shores of Great
Salt Lake for a day or so. This great inland sea, fifty
miles long by twenty wide, was on our left, while to the
right rose abrupt mountains barren to the summit. The
Lake itself was surrounded by marshes, abounding in
water-fowl, and just then afforded excellent duck-shooting
to frequent parties from the city. It was dotted with
islands, several of them large and mountainous, which
furnished rich pasturage for large herds of horses and
cattle, belonging chiefly to Brigham Young. These
beautiful islands had been "granted" to him by the
Utah Legislature, as well as the exclusive right to
numerous streams and cañons in other parts of the Territory,
that were esteemed especially valuable. Among
others, they had granted to him City Creek cañon, which
contained about the only valuable timber within many
miles of Salt Lake City, and now every man, who chopped
a load of wood there, had to pay tribute to Brother
Brigham to the tune of one dollar per cord. Along the
base of the mountains, we frequently came across hot
Sulphur Springs, steaming in the sharp November air,[Pg 210]
and Mr. Halsey pointed out several said to be hot enough
to boil an egg. The sulphur and heat from them destroyed
all vegetation around them, and also for a considerable
distance along the issuing streams, that flowed
thence into Great Salt Lake. Every few miles we
crossed dashing rivulets, that came roaring and foaming
out of the cañons, all making their way ultimately to the
Lake       the common reservoir of all that basin. Great
Salt Lake drains many hundreds of square miles there,
receiving streams from all directions, but giving out
none. Its only relief is evaporation, which of course
must be enormous during the long and dry summer
there. Hence its saltiness and great specific gravity, a
man floating in it       it is said       very readily. Its volume
that year was greater than usual, owing it was thought to
a heavy rain-fall; but this year (1873), I see it reported as
several feet higher, than ever before. This would seem
to confirm the favorite theory of many pioneers, that as
the country became settled up and cultivated, the average
rain-fall constantly increased. Between the mountains
and the Lake, along its whole extent, there was usually
a fine broad plateau of land, and this was dotted thickly
with farms to Ogden and beyond.

Ogden, now the stopping point on the Pacific Railroad
for Salt Lake City, and about forty miles north of
it, was then a smart little town of perhaps 1200 inhabitants,
and rapidly growing larger. It was Salt Lake
City over again, on a reduced scale, but evidently patterning
after it, both in plan and detail. Its streets were
broad and rectangular; its irrigating streams, clear and
cold from the neighboring cañons; its houses, adobe or
frame; and its yards and gardens, a mass of beauty and
luxuriance. A general air of industry and thriftiness
pervaded the little community. Everybody appeared to[Pg 211]
be constantly at work, though not very hard work. And,
indeed, so far as material comfort was concerned, there
seemed little ground for criticism. The supervisor and
main-spring of the whole was Bishop West       a burly
active man of forty, with three buxom wives, and a
house-full of well-graduated children. He was a live,
go-ahead business man, with little or nothing of the
sacerdotal about him       owned the mill, store, and hotel
there, and managed them all with rare shrewdness and
energy. His hotel was a comfortable two-story adobe
house, with shingle roof, and was remarkably well kept
for a country tavern, all things considered. He was a
heavy contractor with the stage-line, to deliver grain
along at the stations between Salt Lake and Boisè City,
and Mr. Halsey concluded to stop over one night to see
and confer with him. He received us with generous
hospitality, and was soon conversing freely upon all matters
relating to Utah, aside from Mormonism. He little
suspected then the good luck in store for him, by the oncoming
of the Pacific Railroad, which has doubtless made
him a millionaire, if he was not approaching that before.
Salt Lake was then depending on the Railroad coming
there, and doubtless was grievously disappointed, when
it left her "out in the cold"       forty miles to the South.[13]

The Bishop's partner in many of his operations was
Mr. Joseph Young, the eldest son, I believe, of Brigham.
He happened at Ogden that night, and we saw considerable
of him. Mr. Halsey said he was "some married"
already, having four wives, and as he was still a comparatively
young man       about thirty-five       might have a
good many more yet. He was a tall, well-knit, resolute[Pg 212]
looking young fellow; but did not seem to be overly well
stocked with brains or judgment. Nevertheless, in addition
to his investments with Bishop West, he owned saw-mills
in the mountains beyond Salt Lake, and was a heavy
contractor with the stage-company besides for supplies
elsewhere. He spoke carelessly, not to say disrespectfully,
about Mormon affairs in general, and left the
impression, that he might abjure the faith some day yet,
when the fit occasion came. Brigham, it appears, had discarded
him for the succession some time before, in favor
of his younger brother, Brigham, Jr., who was said to
be a much abler and discreeter man; and this, it was
thought, had something to do with "Joe's" free and
easy thinking.

From Ogden to Brigham City, about half way to
Bear River, the country continued much the same, except
that the mountains trended away more to the east, and
the plateau thence to the Lake consequently became
broader. Settlements continued most of the way, but
the farms grew more scattered, and ran more to grazing.
Wherever a stream issued from the cañons, it had been
caught up and carried far up and down the plateau, to
irrigate a wide breadth of land, and its application
appeared always to have met with a generous return.
Brigham City was a clever little town, of a thousand
inhabitants or so, and in its general plan and make up
was as much like Ogden as two peas. It lies on a higher
bench or plateau, however, and affords a much finer
prospect of the bottom country below. We halted there
for dinner, and while waiting in the office a Ute Indian
came in, with a noble wild goose for sale, that he had
just shot in the marshes. He was a splendidly built
young fellow, with nothing in the way of clothing, however,
except a ragged blanket and the inevitable breech-cloth.[Pg 213]
His feet and limbs were entirely naked, and
would have served well as models for a Belvidere
Apollo. It was a cold raw day, with alternating rain
and sleet, and no wonder the poor wretch mumbled,
"Me cold; much cold!" as he huddled up to the fire.
He sold his goose for two "bits," and the last we saw of
him he was purchasing "smoke-tobacco" at the nearest
store. We saw many lodges of Utes, while en route from
Ogden to Bear River, and they all seemed to be pitiably
off. As we left Brigham City, we observed a dozen
squaws or more loitering around a slaughter-house on its
outskirts, waiting to secure the entrails or other refuse,
that the butchers might throw away. Just beyond, several
more crossed the road, loaded down with great bundles
of sage-brush, that they had been out gathering for
fuel, while their "braves" loafed at home. "Mr. Lo" (the
poor Indian!), as our borderers satirically call him, in
brief, has certainly sadly deteriorated in Utah, whatever
he may be elsewhere. These Utes seemed to be a taller
and better class of savages naturally, than their cousins
on the Rio Grande; but from contact with the Mormons
they were fast disappearing, and would soon become
extinct. Brigham Young was credited with saying, with
his wonted shrewdness, "I can kill more injuns with a
sack of flour, than a keg of gunpowder;" and no doubt
he was correct. When left to themselves, as children of
nature, they manage to get along somehow, on the old
principle of "root pig, or die!" But when they mix
with the whites, they acquire our habits and tastes in
part, without learning how safely to gratify or benefit by
them; and consequently, when left to themselves again,
sicken and die.

From Brigham City to Bear River, the country was
wilder and more unsettled; but ranches       the true forerunners[Pg 214]
of settlements       were starting up in various
places. The mountain streams were smaller and fewer,
but still there were enough to irrigate thousands of broad
acres there yet, and to spare. Indeed, the whole country
from Salt Lake to Bear River, as a rule, needs only population,
to become prosperous and nourishing. The
mountain streams did not seem to be a quarter utilized;
and, apart from these, vast tracks of land were unused,
where grazing would certainly prove profitable.

We crossed Bear River, here a broad deep stream, on
a rude bridge, and were now fairly off for Boisè City.
Here, eighty-three miles from Salt Lake, the road forked       one
branch going to Virginia City, Montana, and the
other continuing on to Boisè. The Montana travel was
then much the larger, and the stages thus far went full.
But the Idaho travel was light       most of her miners
preferring the Columbia as a base. From Bear River
quite through to Boisè, the country as a whole proved
wild and sterile, with but little to recommend it, until we
struck the valley of the Boisè. There were some good
grazing lands here and there, judging by the "bunch"
grass; but Idaho, as a rule, seemed to be a high volcanic
plateau, barren and desert-like. Much of it reminded us
of Bitter Creek, though here there was less alkali
and old red sand-stone. There were no settlements anywhere,
except the isolated stage-stations, and but little
travel beyond the tri-weekly stages. The lonely stations
occurred as usual, every ten or fifteen miles, but
they were most dreary and dismal habitations, as a rule.
They were built generally of stone, laid up loosely with
clay, and often their only fuel was sage-brush and grease-wood       about
the last apology for fuel on the earth.
The whole region seemed destitute of timber, until you
reached the Boisè, and even here there was not much to[Pg 215]
brag of. Good wholesome water seemed to be equally
rare, and even at the stage-stations where they had dug
for it, the water was often very unpalatable. We passed
three stations, one after the other, one day, where Mr.
Halsey knew the water to be bad, without essaying to
drink, and finally became so thirsty that when we
reached the next station, all hands sung out to the
station-keepers:

"I say, men, what kind of water have you here?"

"Wall, strangers," was the reply, "Honor bright, it
is not much to brag of! It is a heap alkali, and right
smart warm; but we manage to drink it, when it cools
a little. It's altogether, you see, in gitten used to it; you
bet!"

But as we hadn't got "used to it" yet, and hadn't
time to wait, we concluded to pass on to the next station.
At most of the stations, the only persons were two stock-tenders
or stable-hands, and sometimes only one. At
Maláde, however, as we halted there one cold and blustering
night, we were agreeably surprised to find a blazing fire
and an excellent meal, that gained all the more by contrast
with the forlorn and cheerless stations, that greeted us
elsewhere. A neat and tidy woman, with an instinct
of true refinement about her, was the simple explanation.
But how she came to drop down into that desolate
station, with a husband and two or three children,
will always remain one of the inexplicable mysteries of
the Universe to me.

We were now on the old and well-travelled Emigrant
Trail from the Missouri to Oregon. But emigration that
way had mostly ceased, and the general unattractiveness
of the country was shown, by its leaving no settlements
behind. Much of the route had always been a natural
road across the plateaus; but in crossing the "divides"[Pg 216]
and descending into the abrupt valleys, considerable digging
and blasting had been done here and there. We
neither saw nor heard of any Indians, and I judge the
country as a whole was always too barren and desolate
to support any thing but wolves. Night after night we
heard these howling around us, and sometimes by day
a single cayote would skulk across the road; but they
took good care to give our Remingtons and Spencers
a wide berth. How the cayotes or wolves of these
plateaus, and of the Plains, manage to live, it is hard to
say. There seems little for them to subsist on ordinarily.
And yet camp where you will at night, an hour afterwards
the whole surrounding landscape becomes vocal
with them. First, it is a solitary yelp, and then a constantly
widening chorus, until thousands of the cowards
seem to be on the bark. One night we got out to walk,
over a piece of extra bad road, and as we rounded a rocky
point toward the coming station, suddenly a score or
more of them opened on us at once. It was pitchy
dark, and the suddenness of their onset certainly startled
us; but we sent them our compliments in the direction
of the sound, from a Spencer carbine and two revolvers,
and that was the last we heard of them. The Indians
sometimes counterfeit their howling, in order to take
travellers unawares; but otherwise, however startling,
there seemed to be little real danger about it, as they
seldom or never attack a man.

We crossed Snake River on a rude ferry-boat, stage
and all, and found it to be there some two or three hundred
yards wide, by perhaps forty feet deep. Its banks
were abrupt       its water of the same pea-green, as that at
Niagara. It was skirted by narrow bottoms on either
side, and then came precipitous basaltic walls, hundreds
of feet high to the plateau above. This plateau again[Pg 217]
was of the same sterile character, as the country already
passed over       devoid of animal and vegetable life, except
wolves, sage-brush and grease-wood, and even these didn't
seem much inclined to nourish there. The Snake itself
seemed to be an abrupt cut, through the heart of a vast
volcanic plateau, as if following in the track of some
ancient earthquake.

Snake River Station was on the north side, just at
the foot of the high basaltic bluff, which here rears its
majestic front six hundred feet or more perpendicularly
into the air. Half way up, a small river bursts forth,
and descends in a beautiful cascade two or three hundred
feet, whence it rushes like an arrow down the broken,
rocky hillside, and so off to the Snake itself. This fleecy
waterfall, against the black basaltic bluff, is the first
object that strikes you, as you descend into the valley
of the Snake, and is a charming feature of the landscape
just there. Our route lay along the Snake for many
miles, and at several other points we observed similar
cascades, on both sides of the river, though none so large
or lofty as this. The conclusion seems inevitable, that
subterranean streams, having their sources in the far
away Mountains, pervade all this barren region; and
could these be tapped and brought to the surface, all
these plateaus might be made cultivable and fertile. No
doubt a way of doing this, by artesian-wells or otherwise,
will be found in the future, when the continent fills up
more, and Idaho becomes necessary. But these cascades
could be utilized immediately, to irrigate much of the
bottoms of the Snake at trifling expense, if anybody chose
to settle there. These bottoms, as a rule, appeared very
rich; but in the absence of rain there for months, were
no better than a dust heap. At Snake River Station,
indeed, attempts had been made to raise potatoes, and[Pg 218]
other garden vegetables, and the results seemed encouraging.
No doubt, rye, oats, barley, and flax might be
grown there thus very readily; but probably the region
is too elevated, and too far north, for the more delicate
cereals to succeed well.

The great American Falls of Snake River were
twenty miles or so farther up, and, much to our regret,
we failed to reach them. Mr. Halsey intended taking
us that way, but he was already overdue in Boisè, and
as I myself had lost a fortnight by illness at Salt Lake,
and the weather was threatening, we concluded to
hasten on. These falls have been described by some
travellers, as much superior to Niagara; but the
station-keeper at Snake River said he had visited them
the previous spring, and they seemed to him to be only
about a hundred feet or so in height in all. He
described them, as consisting of two Falls       the first
about twenty-five feet high, with foaming rapids to the
second or main fall, which itself then goes down perhaps
seventy-five feet or so more. He said, however, that
a party of soldiers, from an adjacent post, had measured
them only a few weeks before, and they reported them
as one hundred and ninety-four feet high in all, by
perhaps two hundred yards wide, and with the black
basaltic walls of the cañon rising some six hundred feet
above them still, on either side. During seasons of
high water, this would make them quite worthy, indeed,
of their great reputation. But the volume of water
there for many months in the year must be so small,
that it is to be doubted whether they ordinarily
approach the grandeur and sublimity of majestic old
Niagara. However, Idahoans set great store by these
Falls, as the chief wonder of all that region; and as the[Pg 219]
country just there has little else to brag of, perhaps it is
well not to gainsay them.

From the Snake to the Boisè, as already intimated,
the country was, if anything, still more barren and
desolate, than the region we had just passed over. In
some places, it was strewn thick for miles with black
volcanic stones and rocks, glazed and scarred by ancient
fires, with no signs of ordinary animal or vegetable life
anywhere. In such localities, the wolves disappeared,
and even the inevitable sage-brush and grease-wood disdained
to grow; or, if they grew at all, only eked out a
miserable existence. Once across this high "divide,"
however, we struck the valley of the Boisè, which soon
introduced us to an excellent region again, and as we
neared Boisè City we found ranches and farms everywhere
thickening up. Horses and cattle were out
grazing by the roadside in considerable numbers, and
down in the bottoms frequent squads of stacks indicated,
that goodly crops of hay and grain had been cut and
harvested. Wagons now appeared again on the road, as
beyond Bear River, (we had not met a single one since
leaving there), and people flocked to the doors and
windows as the stage rolled by. Once across the "divide"
between the Snake and Boisè, the whole country sloped
gently to the Boisè, and we spun along and down these
descending grades at a splendid gait. We made one
hundred and twenty miles, in the last twenty-two hours
out from Boisè City, and rolled up to the Overland
House with our last team as fresh and gamey as stallions.

Our general ride from Bear River, however, was
hardly an enviable one. There were but three of us       Mr.
Halsey, myself, and L. We had mattrasses
along, which we carried on top by day, and at night
arranged into a passable bed. So, too, we had india-rubber[Pg 220]
pillows, and robes and blankets in abundance.
But the weather was very disagreeable, even for the season,
and though convalescent I yet found myself far from
strong. We left Bear River about 10 p. m., in an ugly
storm of rain and sleet, well tucked in for a night's ride;
but in an hour or so were roused up by the stage coming
to a dead-halt, and the driver singing out       it sounded
half-maliciously       "Good place to walk, gents! Bad
place ahead!" Out we got for a dismal walk of a mile
or more, through a soft and yielding bottom, where the
horses could hardly pull the empty coach through, and
then in again with muddy boots and disgusted feelings
generally. Just before daybreak, we struck a long and
steep "divide," where the sleet had thickened into snow,
without stiffening the ground enough to bear the coach
up, and here again we had another cheerful walk of a
couple of miles or so, to relieve the blown horses. At
King Hill, the last serious "divide" before reaching
Boisè, we had another promenade of a mile or two,
through five or six inches of snow, just after midnight;
but I managed to stick by the stage. The weather continued
raw and cold, rainy and sleety, by turns, and we
found it necessary to keep well wrapped up, except in
the middle of the day. At night our mattrasses proved
too narrow for three, after all, and Halsey's shoulders or
knees were constantly punching into either L. or me. He
and L. usually slept right along all night, but I got scarcely
a genteel wink from Bear River to Boisè. By sunrise
ordinarily we were up, and then came a general smoke and
talk over the night's experience. By nine or ten a. m. we
halted for breakfast, which usually consisted of chicory
coffee, stringy beef or bacon, and saleratus-biscuit. Sometimes
we got fried potatoes in addition       which helped
the meal out somewhat       but not often. Late at night[Pg 221]
we stopped for dinner (only two meals a day), which was
generally only a poor edition of breakfast over again,
with the courses perchance reversed. Bilious and aguish
with that accursed mountain-fever still hanging about
me, I need scarcely say, I had little relish for such a bill
of fare, and indeed scarcely ate a "square meal" from
Bear River to Boisè. Fortunately, among other extras,
Mr. Halsey had had the forethought to lay in a half a
bushel of apples, just fresh from the tree at Salt Lake,
and these we all munched ad libitum as we journeyed
along. They were always juicy and cool, piquant and
delicious, when nothing else was palatable; and for my
part, I really don't see, how I would have got through
without them. We were three days and three nights on
the road continuously, never stopping except forty minutes
or so at a time for meals. The last twenty-four
hours out, the weather was raw and cold even for
November; and as we rolled into Boisè, with every joint
aching, the lights of a town never seemed more winning
and welcome. At the Overland House, they were
already full. But they gave us a good hot supper, followed
by a "shake-down" in the parlor, and every comfort
at their disposal.

A word more about kind Mr. Halsey. A New
Yorker by birth, he drifted west when a boy, and at an
early age became clerk on a Mississippi steamer. Subsequently,
he followed the Army in 1857 to Utah, and
was engaged for awhile in the Q. M. Dep't. at old Camp
Floyd. Then he passed into Mr. Holladay's employ, and
now for several years had been his general superintendent
at Salt-Lake, with a handsome salary of course. He was
a quick, sharp man, about thirty-five, devoted to business,
and sure to make money anywhere, if there was money
to be made. Slightly conservative, he was still a strong[Pg 222]
Union man, and especially proud of Grant and Sherman,
whom he had known before the war. He was a robust
and hardy man, of the kind that can chew cast-iron or
digest pebble-stones (and hence, Idaho pies and biscuit!),
but with a heart as big and tender as a woman's. In the
spring of '65, he attempted to stage it from Atchison to
Salt Lake, but had to walk most of the way, because of
the execrable roads that season. Day after day, he and a
single companion pushed on ahead of the coach, frequently
fording streams up to their arm-pits, especially
among the Mountains, where they must have been icy
cold, and never even changed their clothes the whole
way. They were never dry, or even comfortably warm,
for a day together; and yet they reached Salt Lake all
right, and he said, never seemed to mind it. It is of
such men, that the Border is made up, and these are the
ones that accomplish such miracles out there. Such men
are always the pioneers of the race, and the rightful
founders of empire. "Natural Selection," I suppose,
steps in and duly provides them, by the "survival of the
fittest." We were indebted to him for many courtesies,
in various ways, and would duly acknowledge this here.
Afterwards we met him in San Francisco, and subsequently,
I believe, he settled in New York. Stalwart,
go-ahead, whole-souled Mr. Halsey, good fortune attend
you, wherever you may go!



[Pg 223]




CHAPTER XIV.

BOISÈ CITY TO THE COLUMBIA.


Idaho, one of the latest of our new Territories, was
formed by lopping off the eastern prolongations of
Oregon and Washington, and calling the incipient state
by that euphoneous name. Lewiston, the head of navigation
then, via the Columbia, was originally its capital;
but the "shrieks of locality" demanded a more central
position, and so Boisè City secured the honor. We
found it (Nov., 1860) a mushroom town of log and frame
buildings, but thoroughly alive every way. Three years
before, there was nothing there but the Boisè bottoms,
and a scattered ranch or two. Now she boasted three
thousand inhabitants, two daily newspapers, stage-lines
in all directions, and ebullient prosperity. A hotel, of
large capacity, that was to "take the shine" out of all
the rest, was just being completed. The Episcopalians
and Presbyterians already had their churches up, and the
Methodists were expecting soon to build theirs, though
then worshipping temporarily in the Court House. Excellent
free-schools, to accommodate all the children and
more, abounded, and the sermon we heard on Sunday
was chiefly a "pitching into" Brigham Young, largely
for the want of these. The preacher had been down to
Salt Lake, spying out the land for missionary purposes,
and had returned filled with hearty unction against the
whole system of Mormonism. Boisè City was then the[Pg 224]
centre of the mining regions of Idaho, though not of
them       like Denver, as related to Colorado. The mines
were chiefly miles away, at Owyhee, Ruby, Idaho City,
and Silver City; but all business sprang from and converged
here at Boisè, as the most central point, all things
considered, and most of the "bricks" dropped first into
her lap. Mining operations were mostly over for that
season, and the streets and saloons of Boisè were
thronged with rough miners, en route for the Columbia,
or even California, to winter and return. They claimed
they could save money by this temporary exodus       the
price of living was so high in Idaho       and at the same
time escape the rigor of the climate. With expansive
hats, clad chiefly in red-shirts, and "bearded like a pard,"
every man carried his bowie-knife and revolver, and
seemed ready for any emergency. They were evidently
a rougher crowd, than the Colorado miners, and in talking
with them proved to be from California, Arizona, Nevada,
Oregon, Frazer's River, Montana, and about everywhere
else, except Alaska. Your true miner is a cosmopolite,
who has "prospected" everywhere, from the British
Dominion to Mexico, and he is always ready to depart for
any new "diggings," that promise better than where he
is, on half a day's notice, no matter how far. His
possessions are small, soon bundled up or disposed of,
and he mocks at the old maxim, "A rolling stone gathers
no moss," though usually he is a good exemplification
of it.

The chief business of Boisè, just then, seemed to be
drinking whiskey, and gambling. The saloons were the
handsomest buildings in town, and were thronged at all
hours of the day and night. The gamblers occupied
corners of these, and drove a brisk trade unmolested by
anybody. The restaurants were also important points[Pg 225]
of interest, and gave excellent meals at not unreasonable
prices, all things considered. Here at Boisè, our U. S.
greenbacks for the first ceased to be "currency," and
the precious metals became the only circulating medium.
It did one's eyes good to see our old gold and silver coins
in use once more, though gold and silver "dust" was
also a recognized medium of exchange. All the stores,
restaurants, and saloons kept a delicate pair of scales,
and their customers carried buck-skin or leather bags of
"dust," from which they made payment, and into which
they returned their change. Disputes now and then
arose, from the "dust" offered not being up to the standard;
but these were usually settled amicably, unless the
"dust" proved basely counterfeit, and then the saloons
sometimes flashed with bowie-knives, or rung with
revolvers.

Here, also at Boisè, for the first, we met John Chinaman.
Quite a number of the Celestials had already
reached Idaho from California, via the Columbia, and
were scattered through the towns, as waiters, cooks, launderers,
etc. A few had sought the mines, but not many, as
they preferred the protection of the towns. Along with
the rest, these Chinese miners were also migrating to the
Columbia and beyond; and as they paid their stage-fare
and rode, while many others footed it to the
"River," of course, we augured well of them. The
imbecile, brutal, and barbarous laws of the whole Pacific
Coast, where Chinamen are concerned, it appeared, however,
were still in force in Idaho. A good illustration of
their practical workings had just occurred over in Owyhee,
or somewhere there, and should be recorded here.
Three or four ruffians over there, it appears, had set
upon an unoffending Chinaman at Work in the mines,
and had first abused and insulted him, and then robbed[Pg 226]
and killed him. Other miners, hearing of the circumstances,
arrested the murderers and took them before an
Idaho Dogberry, who promptly liberated them on the
ground, that no Anglo-Saxon was present at the transaction,
and that the Chinamen (who were) were incompetent
as witnesses, as against white men! This was good
Idaho Law and Justice, no doubt. But it was too strong
for the indignant miners, and the same day Judge Lynch
amended it, by hanging all the miscreants in the nearest
gulch. This was rude law, and rough justice, no doubt;
but was it not infinitely better, than the absurd and inhuman
code of the Pacific Coast?

Idaho, as a whole, seemed then to be at a stand-still,
and her merchants, as a rule, were sighing for the flush
times of '63 and '64, when our miners were on the rush
there. Her total yield of the precious metals for '66
was computed at about $5,000,000, against Montana's
$15,000,000. Ross Browne, indeed, with "conspicuous
inexactness," reported Idaho at $15,000,000 that
year; but nearly everybody seemed to think this at
least three times too much       Mr. Halsey, who was a
good judge, especially. Her "placer" mines, or "diggings,"
it was thought, were already well exhausted, and
her quartz-mining will always prove very expensive,
because of the scarcity of fuel, and the heavy cost of
transportation. Railroads, it was hoped, would cheapen
both of these items in the future, but as yet they seemed
distant. From the Columbia to Boisè City, was only about
three hundred miles, and yet the charge then for transportation
over this short distance was more than half the
charge from the Missouri to Salt Lake, some twelve hundred
miles. This was explained, as one result of their
coin basis, and of the high price of wages, and everything[Pg 227]
else in Idaho. But the fact remained, as an ugly circumstance,
for Boisè to digest.

Fort Boisè, on the outskirts of the town, was headquarters
of military affairs in Idaho, but had ceased to
be of much importance. The Territorial Legislature
had already applied to the proper Department at Washington,
for the post buildings, for use of the Territorial
Government, and the troops were ready to vacate any
day. We stopped there a week, studying Idaho affairs
generally, and were delightfully entertained by the post-officers.
One of them had been stationed in California,
at Benicia Barracks, when the war broke out, and he
gave us an interesting account of the attempted Rebel
movement there, which the sudden arrival of Gen. Sumner
on the Coast so effectually squelched. Another was a
Baltimorean, who by reading the Tribune had become a
staunch Republican, and was one of the intensest Union
men I ever met. One day a Paymaster happened along,
whose baggage a fortnight before had been robbed of
$65,000 in greenbacks, and an equal amount in vouchers,
while he was taking supper at Fort Boisè. At first, he
was paralyzed to lose such an amount, in that wild region.
But subsequently he struck a "lead," and followed it up
with the pertinacity of a sleuth-hound, until he recovered
most of the money and vouchers, and arrested all the
thieves. His success was simply wonderful for Idaho,
and his story sounded more like romance than sober
reality, as he told of the long chase and final capture,
with the finding of his greenbacks in carpet-bags, knapsacks,
etc., buried by the roadside, and some even under
the ruts of the very roadway. While halting there, the
news also reached us by telegraph of the November
elections East, and the final outcome of Mr. Johnson's
"Swinging round the circle!" Army officers though[Pg 228]
we were, we could not repress a mild hurrah, and how
intensely proud we felt of the loyal North! Surely we
were a great and noble people, after all. Step by step       nulla
vestigia retrorsum       we had overcome all obstacles,
in the name of Humanity and Justice; and now, evidently,
our reactionary leaders had better take care how they
trifled with the Republic! We talked it all over among
ourselves, as we sat around the camp-fires, at that distant
post in Idaho; and thanked God for America, and that
there was "life in the old land yet!"

Recruited up again pretty well by our stay at
Boisè, we left there Nov. 19th for Umatilla and the
Columbia. Stages ran three times a week, but they
were going so crowded, and the roads were reported so
heavy, that I deemed it more advisable to proceed by
ambulance. It was three hundred miles, and by ambulance
it would take three times as long; but this would
give me an opportunity of resting at night, and I feared
to venture on otherwise, anxious as we were to reach
the Columbia before winter set in. Our route lay
substantially down the valley of the Boisè, and other
tributaries of the Snake, to the Snake at Farewell Bend,
and thence across the Blue Mountains to the Umatilla,
and down that to the Columbia. The chief tributaries
of the Snake just there were the Boisè, Pratt's River,
Burnt River, and Powder River, and we traversed the
valleys of each of these successively. These valleys were
all substantially alike, and consisted usually of bottoms
from two to three miles wide, very fertile throughout,
but all requiring irrigation, except for grass which grew
tolerably well without this. Here and there irrigation
had been resorted to, to some extent, with fine crops in
return; but only a very little of the land had yet been
brought under cultivation. Generally, beyond these[Pg 229]
bottoms, on either side, were elevated benches or plateaus,
from five to six miles in width, extending back to the
outlying bluffs or mountains. These were covered
chiefly with the inevitable sage-brush and grease-wood;
but the soil looked fat and fertile enough, and evidently
required only patient irrigation, to become as prolific as
the fields of Utah. Water for this might be supplied in
part from the rivers mentioned, and in part perhaps from
the neighboring cañons, if they be not dry cañons. The
chief drawback of the country to the Snake, indeed,
seemed to be the scarcity of timber, for fencing and
building purposes. For fuel, coal had been discovered,
both at Farewell Bend and near Boisè City; but timber
for other purposes was everywhere scarce and dear. In
the valley of the Boisè, "Shanghai" fences were frequent,
such as we had seen in eastern Kansas; but the Idahoans
used thongs instead of nails, to fasten the boards or
rails to the posts       hides evidently being cheaper there,
than hardware.

The valley of the Snake, most sinuous of rivers, as
its name well indicates, proved scarcely better, than
where we had crossed it several hundred miles farther up,
a fortnight or so before. But the Snake itself had now
swelled into a broad and majestic river. We travelled
down its banks for ten or twelve miles, and found its
rocky and precipitous bluffs came quite down to the
river generally; and where this was not the case, there
were often only great banks of sand, whirled into such
sheltered places by the winds of ages. Indifferent timber
appeared here and there, but not much to speak of.
The road wound along close to the bluffs, and was often
quarried out of them, without room for more than one
team to pass at a time. We passed one such place by
moonlight, with the bluff high above and the river deep[Pg 230]
below, but fortunately got through safely. We reasoned,
that the usual trains would have gone into camp by
sundown, and took the chances for any accidental travellers
like ourselves. It was a beautiful night, with the moon
out in all her glory, walking a cloudless sky and filling the
cañon of the Snake with a flood of light; but we were
not sorry when we heard the lowing of the cattle, and the
wee-hawing of the mules, belonging to the trains in camp
beyond. It was eight p. m., (Nov. 20th), when we
reached Farewell Bend, and here crossed the Snake again
on a stout ferry-boat propelled by the current.

Farewell Bend       a hamlet of half a dozen houses       is
so called, because here the Snake makes a sudden turn
north, and goes off in a wide circuit through the mountains
of Idaho and Oregon, instead of keeping straight
on to the Columbia, as it seems it should have done.
Here, too, is where the great Emigrant Trail, from the
Missouri to the Columbia, finally leaves the Snake, and
hence also perhaps the name to this bend. The
Snake, or Lewis' Fork of the Columbia, as it is sometimes
called, altogether is a right noble stream       by far the
largest in all that region       and it seemed would yet be
made available for navigation, though now badly beset
with reefs and rapids. A steamboat had already been
built at Farewell Bend, to run up to the neighborhood of
Boisè and beyond; but that was her first season, and the
results were yet to be seen. It was said, that by starting
early in the season, she could reach a point within about
two hundred miles of Salt Lake, and thus communicate
with a vast region there, then comparatively isolated.
A fine vein of good bituminous coal had just been
opened in the overhanging bluff at Farewell Bend, and
here was fuel cheap for all the country up the Snake.
Below Farewell Bend there were rapids that would have[Pg 231]
to be circumvented by slack-water navigation or railroad
portages, the same as on the Columbia. But with this
done, the Snake had long stretches of navigable waters,
that needed only population and business to make them
teem with commerce. The same Company, that made
the Columbia navigable, also built the boat at Farewell
Bend, and doubtless intended to push the enterprise,
though what they have since accomplished I can not
say.

The Snake is the western boundary of Idaho, and,
having crossed it at Farewell Bend, we were now fairly
in Oregon. We soon struck the valley of Burnt River,
and followed it up for many miles. At first, it abounded
in wild and rocky cañons, that seemed to have no
outlet; but farther on, it widened out, and frequent
ranches dotted its broad and fertile bottoms. Powder
River valley, the next beyond, was more promising
still. This contained thousand of acres of rich
grass lands, and hundred of settlers had already pre-empted
homes there. Cattle and sheep were grazing
along the bottoms in considerable numbers, and the
adjacent mountains, we were told, abounded in timber
for all necessary purposes. At Baker City, in the heart
of Powder River valley, we halted one day for dinner,
and found a brisk little town of perhaps five hundred
inhabitants or so. It contained two quite respectable
hotels, and at one of them we got a plain but excellent
dinner. Just in the suburbs, we found a ten stamp
quartz-mill in full blast, much to our surprise, yielding       it
was said       a clear profit of $4,000 in coin per month.
The ores came from a silver mine, ten or twelve miles
away in the mountains, and the mill was located here to
take advantage of Powder River, which was here really
a fine stream.

[Pg 232]

Farther on, after a long and tedious drive up and across
a stony "divide," we came suddenly out on Grande Ronde
valley, and were amazed at its beauty and fertility. At
first view, it seemed almost circular, and looked like a
vast bowl hollowed out of the mountains there. Mountains
bristling with pine or fir-trees rimmed it in on all
sides, while in their midst the valley reposed, as if a
dried up lake. Some thirty miles in length, by twenty-five
in width, it contains over six hundred square miles
of the very washings of the mountains       the whole as rich
and fertile as a garden. Cedar, fir, pine, and oak abound
in the embracing mountains; but the valley itself is as
bare of timber, as an Illinois prairie. Numberless
springs burst out of the mountain sides, and coalescing
into streams gridiron the valley       uniting at last in Grande
Ronde River, which flows thence to the Snake. In
places, we were told, there are hot mineral springs also,
but we saw none of these. The edges of the valley       seemingly
like the rim of a plate       were already sprinkled
well with ranches, while horses, cattle, and sheep by the
thousand were grazing off in the bottoms. But few
houses appeared in the bottoms yet       the settlers apparently
preferring to hug the mountains. The wheat crop
of the valley that year alone was computed at half a
million of bushels, and large quantities of oats, barley,
potatoes etc., had been raised besides. Indian corn, or
maize, however, had never flourished well, and it was
doubted if it would       it being so far north. Even here,
though, irrigation had to be resorted to for most summer
crops, but down in the bottoms grass grew luxuriantly
without this. Grande Ronde, indeed, resembles the great
parks of Colorado, only her soil is far finer, and if cultivated
to the full, along with Powder River and Burnt
River, would alone supply Idaho with pretty much all[Pg 233]
she needs. We met old settlers there, who years before
had emigrated thither from Missouri and Illinois,
tempted by the wondrous beauty and fertility of the
place, and one could not wonder at their choice of a
home. In all that region we saw nothing like Grande
Ronde, and indeed but few places to compare with it
from the Missouri to the Columbia. Its only drawback
seemed to be the severe winds, which prevail there much
of the year. It appeared strange, that a valley so
embosomed in mountains should be troubled so with
winds. But it seemed to be a sort of funnel, and they
said the winds were often fierce and continuous there,
for long periods together. Nevertheless, unless these approximate
to hurricanes or tempests, we could only say,
"Blessed be the man who dwells in Grande Ronde!"

Le Grande, the county-seat, we found to be a thriving
town of a thousand or so inhabitants, and the largest and
busiest place by far since leaving Boisè. At the foot of
the Mountains, where the road from the Columbia
debouches into Grande Ronde, it caught a large amount
of trade and travel that way, and also did considerable
business with several gold and silver mines in the adjacent
mountains. These mines, it seemed, were not
believed to amount to much; but they helped to sustain
and build up Le Grande, and so were welcomed. Just
then the town was discouraged somewhat, by the
recent transfer of the mail-route to Uniontown. But as
the county-seat, with two weekly papers, and Grande
Ronde to back her, she would evidently continue to prosper,
notwithstanding her loss of the stages. A smart
church, and a really fine public-school-house, graced the
plateau beyond the town       both of which spoke volumes
for Le Grande. The main street, however, was almost
impassable for the deep and unctuous mud; but by keeping[Pg 234]
straight ahead, and a little careful man      uvring, we
managed to reach "Our House," the most respectable
looking hotel, at last. Here they gave us excellent
accommodations for the night, and the next morning we
started to cross the Blue Mountains.

We had left Boisè with a four-mule team, but at the
end of the first day our lead-mules gave out, and we had
to hire a pair of ponies to take their places. These
ponies       the only animals we could secure       were bright
and active little nags, and with them at the head we
posted along, at the rate of forty or fifty miles per day
very readily. But at Powder River, one of them becoming
lame, we were compelled also to drop the other, and
this reduced us to only our original wheel-mules       a pair
of large, but antiquated, and sorry-looking donkeys,
that entertained grave constitutional objections to any
gait faster than a walk. When we struck a bit of extra
good road       especially if a little down hill       our driver
usually managed, by much pounding and profanity,
to persuade them into a mild trot. But when we reached
the bottoms, or if a "divide" appeared, they speedily
gravitated again into their natural creep. We were all day
long making our last twenty-six miles out from Le Grande,
and it was clear we would never get over the Blue
Mountains with this pokey team, if the roads were as
reported. Fortunately, at Le Grande, we succeeded in
hiring a fresh team, of four fine and spirited horses, and
with these we swung out of the town (Nov. 24th) on a
good round trot       a delightful contrast to our snail-like
pace on coming in. We had sighted the Blue Mountains       the
northern prolongation of the Sierra Nevadas       two
days before, soon after leaving Baker City, and all along
had got ugly accounts of the condition of the roads there.
Their bald summits already showed snow here and there,[Pg 235]
and for a day or two another snow-storm had been lowering
in the sky, much to our anxiety. But as we rolled
out of Le Grande, the sun came out bright and clear, and
with our ambulance stout and strong, and our high-stepping
steeds, all the auspices seemed to change in our
favor. We soon struck the Le Grande river, and followed
this up for several miles, through wild and picturesque
cañons, or along the shelving sides of the mountains,
where often two teams could hardly pass. The
Le Grande carried us well up and into the Mountains, and
every hour the scenery became grander and wilder.
Grande Ronde valley soon passed out of sight; but, as we
ascended, from various points we caught exquisite views
of the wide-stretching ranges and valleys beyond. Farther
up, we became environed with hills and gorges,
covered thick with gigantic fir-trees, though here and
there a clump of cedars or pines appeared. All along we
met the wild snow-drop, loaded down with its berries, and
in sheltered nooks saw the wild currant, with here and
there harebells, though these were rare. The mountain-laurel
also occurred frequently; but the great predominating
growth was the Oregon fir, from the size of a bamboo
cane to the leafy monarch, "fit to be the mast of
some great admiral." The road was constructed on the
cork-screw principle       much around to get a little ahead       but
after countless twistings and turnings, we at length
reached the summit, long after noon. Here we found a
comparatively level plateau, some two or three miles in
width, with only a few scattered fir-trees, swept keenly
by the wind, from which we slowly descended over the
remains of a once corduroyed road to "Meacham's."
We arrived at "Meacham's" about 4 p. m.       only twenty-six
miles from Le Grande, after all; but as it was still
twelve miles to "Crawford's," the next ranch, at the[Pg 236]
northern foot of the Mountains, it seemed imprudent to
venture on that day.

As to the wagoning, I need scarcely say, it well
exemplified, with abounding emphasis, "Jordan's a hard
road to travel!" The roads, indeed, as a whole, after
we got up into the Mountains, were simply execrable,
and our ride in that respect anything but romantic. All
along the route, we found freight-trains, bound for Boisè
City and the Mines, hopelessly "stalled." Some of the
wagons with a broken wheel or axle, had already been
abandoned. Others were being watched over by their
drivers, stretched on their blankets around huge fires by
the roadside, smoking or sleeping, patiently awaiting
their comrades, who had taken their oxen or mules to
double-up on some team ahead, and would return with
double teams for them to-morrow or next day, or the
day after       whenever they themselves got through.
Snow had already fallen on the Mountains, once or twice
that season; we found several inches of it still in various
places, and the air and sky both threatened more, as the
day wore on. Yet these rough freighters looked upon
the "situation" very philosophically, and appeared quite
indifferent whether they got on or stayed. If it snowed,
the forest afforded plenty of wood, their wagons plenty
of provisions, and their wages went on just the same;
so where was the use of worrying? This seemed to be
about the way they philosophized, and accustomed to
the rude life of the Border, they did not mind "roughing
it" a little. An old army friend used often to parade
a pet theory of his, that a man could not associate
much with horses, without directly deteriorating. "The
horse," he would say, "may gain largely, but it will
only be at the expense of the man. Our cavalry and
artillery officers always were the wickedest men in the[Pg 237]
service, and all because of their equine associations.
The animals, indeed, become almost human; but in
the same proportion, the men become animals!" I
always thought him about half-right; but if this be true
as to intimacy with horses, what must be the effect on
men of long and constant association with mules or oxen!
I thought I saw a good deal of this in mule-drivers in
the army, in Virginia and Tennessee; but a harder or
rougher set, than the ox-men or "bull-whackers" (as they
call themselves) of the Plains and Mountains, it would
be difficult perhaps to find, or even imagine. On the
road here in the Blue Mountains, with their many-yoked
teams struggling through the mud and rocks,
of course, they were in their element. Outré, red-shirted,
big-booted, brigand-looking ruffians, with the
inseparable bowie-knife and revolver buckled around
their waists, they swung and cracked their great whips
like fiends, and beat their poor oxen along, as if they
had no faith in the law of kindness here, nor belief in a
place of punishment hereafter. And when they came
to a really bad place       in crossing a stream, or when
they struck a stump or foundered in a mud-hole       it is
hard to say whether their prodigious, multiplied, and
many-headed oaths were more grotesque or horrible.
To say "they swore till all was blue," would be but a
feeble comparison; the whole Mountains corruscated with
sulphur! Some few of the trains consisted only of horse
and mule teams; but ox-teams seemed most in favor, and
slow as they were, we took quite a fancy to them       they
appeared so reliable. When the roads were good, they
averaged ten or twelve miles per day, and subsisted by
grazing; when they became bad, they managed to flounder
through any how       some way or other. At extra bad
places, the teams were doubled or trebled up, and then[Pg 238]
the wagon was bound to come, if the wood and iron only
held together. Twenty or thirty yoke of oxen straining
to the chains, with the "bull-whackers" all pounding
and yelling like mad, their huge whip-lashes thick as
one's wrist cracking like pistols, was a sight to see       "muscular,"
indeed, in all its parts. The noise and confusion,
the oaths and thwacks and splashing of the
mud, made it indeed the very hell of animals; but, for
all that, the wagon was sure to reach terra firma at last,
no matter how heavily loaded, or pull to pieces. We had
great sympathy for the patient, faithful oxen, and wished
for Mr. Henry Bergh and his Cruelty-Prevention Society
many a time that day. Here, indeed, was some explanation
of the high rates of freight from the Columbia to
Boisè; and Idaho would find it to her interest to improve
such routes of transportation forthwith.

I need scarcely add, it was a hard day on our noble
horses, but they carried us through bravely. Our ambulance
was a light spring carriage, with only L., myself
and the driver, and could not have weighed over fifteen
hundred pounds, baggage and all; yet it was just as
much as the four gamey horses wanted to do to haul
us along. It was a steady, dragging pull throughout,
after we were well into the Mountains, with scarcely any
let-up; up-hill, of course, most of the way, with deep
mud besides; chuck-holes abounding, and quagmires frequent;
in and out, and around freight-trains "stuck" in the
road; and on arriving at "Meacham's," our gallant team,
though by no means exhausted, yet seemed very willing
to halt for the night. How we congratulated ourselves
on securing them, before quitting Le Grande! Had we
started with our pair of dilapidated donkeys, we would
never have got through; but would probably have had to
camp out in the Mountains over night, and send back for[Pg 239]
another team, after all. Once in rounding a rocky hillside,
above a yawning chasm, our "brake" snapped
short off, early in the forenoon; and again, in one of the
worst quagmires, our drawing-rope by which the leaders
were attached broke, and we would no doubt have been
hopelessly ship-wrecked, had it not been for our forethought
on leaving Le Grande. Fortunately, accustomed
to army roads on the Peninsula and in Tennessee, we
laid in a supply of rope and nails there, with a good
stout hatchet, and these now stood us in excellent stead.
With these we soon repaired all damages satisfactorily,
and went on our way       not exactly rejoicing; but rather
with grave apprehensions lest we should break down
entirely, far away from any human habitation, and have
to pass a supperless night by the roadside, or around a
roaring fire, with wolves, bears, and such like "varmints"
perhaps uncomfortably near about us.

So, it was, we were glad to be safe at "Meacham's,"
at last, and to sit down to the generous cheer he gave us
at nightfall. Though 8,000 feet or more, above the sea,
and built wholly of logs, it was the cleanest, cheeriest,
and best public-house we had yet seen in either Oregon
or Idaho, outside of Boisè City; and even the "Overland"
there indeed set no better table, if as good. We
did ample justice to the luscious venison, sausage, and
pumpkin-pies, that they gave us for dinner at 6 p. m.       having
breakfasted at 6 a. m., and eaten nothing since.
Mr. Meacham himself, our genial host, was a live Oregonian,
who had come thither from Illinois several years
before, and with his brother now owned this ranch, and
the road over the Blue Mountains       such as it was. Bad
as it was just then, it had cost them a good deal of
money, first and last; and being the shortest road from
navigation on the Columbia to Idaho and Montana, it[Pg 240]
had paid well in other years, when there was a "rush"
of miners to those regions. But the emigration thither
had now fallen much off, and besides a competing road
had been opened from Wallula on the Columbia       flanking
the Mountains in part       to Uniontown in Grande
Ronde valley, and so beyond, which it was believed would
hurt the Meacham Road seriously. The mail now went
this new road, and trade and travel it was thought would
be apt to follow the stage-coaches. Yet Mr. Meacham
was not discouraged. He was a plucky, wide-awake
man, some forty years of age, with brown hair and stubborn-looking
beard, and in general looked like a person
who could take care of himself well, travel or no travel.
His wife was a really interesting lady, with several well-bred
children; and in the evening, when we asked for
something to read, he surprised us by producing a file
of the N. Y. Times, Greeley's American Conflict, and
Raymond's Abraham Lincoln. He had been a candidate
for the Oregon Legislature at the recent election, and
though running much ahead of his ticket, had been
beaten by a small majority. He explained, that "the
left wing of Price's army" was still encamped in that
part of Oregon, and that the Oregon democracy generally
were only a step removed from Gov. Price and Jefferson
Davis. The early settlers there, he said, had
been mostly "Pikes" from Missouri, and they still
clung to their old pro-slavery (and therefore Confederate)
ideas. In '61, many of them had indeed favored
secession, and later in the war when Price's forces were
finally routed in Missouri, hundreds of his soldiers
deserted and made for Oregon, where they already had
acquaintances or friends. We had heard something of
this before, and now understood what was meant by the
popular expression       even at Salt Lake       that "the left[Pg 241]
wing of Price's army was encamped" in Idaho and
Oregon! Later in the evening, he gathered his little
ones about us, and would have us talk about army
experiences, during the war and afterwards, and affairs
East generally. In return, he gave us his experiences
West and incidents of border-life, by the hour together.
Thus we spun yarns by his ample fire-side, until the
"wee sma' hours" and after       the fir-logs blazing and
roaring welcome up his wide-throated chimney       when
he showed us to a cosy room, and an excellent bed,
clean and sweet beyond expectation even.

During the night, I was awakened by the rain pattering
on the roof, just over our heads; but this soon ceased,
and the next morning we had several inches of snow, with
huge flakes still falling. This was a bad outlook; nevertheless,
we decided to go on, as it was impossible to say
how long the storm would last, or how severe it would
become. We did not want to be "snow-bound" there,
and besides we thought we could reach "Crawford's"
anyhow, as it was but twelve miles or so, and that would
take us well out of the Mountains. We left "Meacham's"
accordingly at 7 a. m., with our horses fresh and keen
after their night's rest, and got along pretty well for a
couple of miles or so, when suddenly, in drawing out of a
chuck-hole, one of our wheels struck a stump, and "smash"
went our king-bolt. Down came the ambulance kerchuck
in the snow and mud; out went the driver over the dashboard
a la bull-frog, but still clinging to the ribbons;
while L. and I sat wrapped in our great-coats and robes on
the back seat, at an angle of forty-five degrees or so.
Here was a pretty predicament, surely! On top of the
Blue Mountains, broken down in a quagmire, the snow
falling fast, and no house nearer than "Meacham's!"
Fortunately, our gamey horses did not frighten and run[Pg 242]
away, or we would have been infinitely worse off. Tumbling
out, we presently ascertained the extent of our damages,
and all hands set to work to repair them. Now it
was, that our forethought at La Grande again handsomely
vindicated itself. With our hatchet we cut props for the
ambulance, and lifted it up on these; and then found, that
though part of the king-bolt was broken off and the balance
badly bent, it could yet be hammered into shape
sufficiently to carry us forward again, with careful driving.
It took an hour or more of sloppy and hard work,
before we got the bolt back again into its place and every
thing "righted up;" and then, as an additional precaution,
with our good rope we lashed the coupling-pole fast to
our fore axle-tree besides. Altogether it made a rough
looking job, but it appeared stout and strong, and we
decided to venture it anyhow. The rest of the way out
of the Mountains, however, we proceeded very cautiously.
The snow continued to fall right along, and concealed
the bad places, so that the roads were even
worse, than the day before, if possible. At all extra-bad
spots, or what seemed so, L. and I got out and
walked; and even when riding, we tried to help the driver
keep the best track, by a sharp lookout ahead and on
either side. Our ambulance, however, rolled and pitched
from quagmire to chuck-hole, like an iron-clad at sea;
and repeatedly when out walking I stopped deliberately,
just to see how beautifully she would capsize, or else collapse
in a general spill, like a "One-Horse Shay!"
All around us was the dense forest: all about us, that
unnatural stillness, that always accompanies falling
snow; no human being near; no sound, but our panting
horses and floundering ambulance; no outlook, but
the line of grim and steely sky above us. "There she
goes! This time sure! See what a hole!" And yet[Pg 243]
by some good luck, she managed to twist and plunge
along through and out of it all, in spite of the mud and
snow; and at last landed us safely on the high bald knob,
that overlooks "Crawford's," and the valley of the Umatilla.
We had about ten miles of this execrable travelling,
expecting any moment to upset or break down; and
when at last we got fairly "out of the wilderness," it
was a great relief. We had an ugly descent still, of two
miles or more, before we reached the valley; but this
was comparatively good going, being downhill, and
besides the snow above had been only rain here.

The view from this bald knob or spur, as we descended,
was really very fine. Just as we rounded its
brow the clouds broke away, and the sun came out for
awhile quite brilliantly. Far beneath us, vast plateaus,
like those between Bear River and Boisè City, stretched
away to the Columbia; and in the distance, the whole
region looked like a great plain or valley. To the north-east,
we could follow for miles the road or trail to Walla-Walla,
as it struck almost in a straight line across the
plateaus; to the northwest, we could mark in the same
way the route to Umatilla. At our feet, and far away
to the west and north, we could trace the Umatilla itself,
as it flowed onward to the Columbia. Beyond all these,
to the north and west still, a hundred and fifty miles
away, sharp against the sky, stood the grand range of the
Cascade Mountains, with their kingliest peaks, Adams,
Hood, St. Helens, and Rainier, propping the very heavens.
On a bright, clear day, this view must be very fine; as
it was, we caught but a glimpse or two of it, just enough
to make us hunger for more, when the clouds shut in
again, and we hastened on. Now that we were out of
the forest, the wind blew strong and keen in our faces,
with no fir-trees to break it, and for a half hour or so[Pg 244]
we shivered with the cold; but it also spurred up our
gallant horses, and we were soon whirling out of the
foot-hills, at a rapid rate. We drew up at "Crawford's"
at 1 p. m., and here halted to lunch and to bait our animals       well
satisfied, after all, with our morning's work.

An hour afterwards we started again, and now bowled
along famously. Our route lay down the valley of the
Umatilla, and as the road was a little sandy, the rain
had made it just good for travelling. L. and I, with our
baggage and driver, were no load at all for four such
gamey nags, especially over a descending grade, and soon
after dark we rolled into "Wells' Springs"       42 miles
from "Meacham's." Here we encountered a motley
crowd of teamsters, miners, and others, all very rough,
en route to Idaho and Montana. "Wells' Springs" was
a shabby ranch, and we had no intention of stopping
there, but were unable to go on       one of our horses
becoming suddenly sick. The house was dirty, and the
supper poor and badly cooked; so that we could readily believe
the slouchy, slatternly landlady, when in the course
of the meal she remarked to one of her rough guests, "O,
we never care for puttin' on style here! Only for raal
substantials!" Supper over, there was a general smoke
and talk, and how those rough fellows did talk! At
bedtime, we were put into a little closet, partitioned off
from the rest, while the main crowd quartered around
"loose" on the floor outside. The last thing we heard,
two "bull-whackers" were disputing as to who I was       one
insisting I was Gen. Grant, and the other contending
I was only Inspector-General U. S. A.! We soon
went heavily to sleep; the next morning, when I awoke,
the same chaps were disputing still!


   
   
   OREGON INDIAN.


Next morning, our sick horse was better, but still
not himself. We left "Wells' Spring," however, at[Pg 245]
7 a. m. on a walk, but soon achieved a trot, and
were getting on quite satisfactorily again, when our
ambulance struck a stone and smash went one of the
rear springs. Two of its leaves showed old breaks, and
it was a mystery how it ever stood the rough and tumble
drive across the Mountains. Again our Le Grande
rope came into play, and breaking a box to pieces we
happened to have along, we soon succeeded in splicing up
the spring, so as to make it hold. An hour's drive more,
however, over a descending road, took us into Umatilla
without further accident, and we hauled up at the Metropolitan,
at 11 a. m. having come eighteen miles.
We were just too late for the tri-weekly boat, down the
Columbia to Portland, which we had been aiming at for
a week       she having left an hour or so before. If it had
not been for our break-down in the Mountains, or for our
sick horse, we would have made Umatilla either early in
the morning, or late the night before, and thus saved two
days. As it was, there was no use lamenting it       we had
done our best       and besides a little time for rest and
writing was not unwelcome.

After emerging from the Blue Mountains at "Crawford's,"
our route thence to the Columbia was chiefly down
the valley of the Umatilla. This was not over a mile or two
in width usually, with high outlying plateaus, that showed
only sand, sage-brush and grease-wood, with here and
there a rocky butte. Population was very scarce, though
we passed a few fine ranches along the Umatilla, that looked
to be doing well, and off on the plateaus we saw several
large flocks of sheep       thousands in number       grazing
under their shepherds. Just beyond "Crawford's,"
the Umatilla and Walla-Walla Indians have a Reservation
twenty miles square, of the best lands in the valley,
and the government has agents there, teaching them to[Pg 246]
farm, raise stock, etc. Their farming did not seem to
amount to much, but their horses, cattle, and sheep, by
the thousand, all looked well. Both of these tribes
together now numbered only about a thousand souls, and
were said to be steadily decreasing. We saw scores of
them on the road, scurrying along on their little ponies       all
of them peaceable and friendly. They were larger
and stouter, than our Ute friends on the Rio Grande;
but did not seem endowed with half their fierceness and
grit. The whole district, from Crawford's to the Columbia,
lacked regular rains in summer, and hence farming to be
successful required irrigation, as much as in Utah. For
this, the Umatilla itself might be made to suffice, a thousand
fold more than it did. Draining a wide region of
country, it rushed with a rapid descent to the Columbia,
and hereafter should be utilized not only to irrigate
largely, but also to drive numerous mills and factories,
that ought then to throng its banks. Long before reaching
the Columbia, it is but little better than a broad raceway;
and for miles, as we drove along, it seemed the
beau-ideal of a natural water-power. Some day, in the
not distant future, when all that region settles up, an
Oregon Lowell will yet hum with spindles there, and its
woolen-cloths and blankets become world-renowned.

It will be seen, we were seven days and a half in getting
through from Boisè City, though expecting to make
it in six. The stages advertised to make it in three, but
the last one had been out five, with the passengers walking
much of the way at that. A party of Irish miners we
overtook on the road, footing it from Montana to the
Columbia, indeed, raced with us for several days, following
us sharply into Le Grande and beating us into
"Meacham's;" but after that, we distanced them. At
Umatilla, people said, we would have found a better road[Pg 247]
and made quicker time, if we had come by Uniontown,
instead of crossing the Mountains; but our driver insisted
"Meacham's" was the best road, and we had been guided
of course by his superior wisdom.

This driver of ours, by the way, was something of a
character. An Ohioan, so long ago as '49, he had joined
the first rush to California, and soon succeeded in picking
up $30,000, or so. Thence he went to Frazer River, on
the first wave, and in a few months sunk pretty much all
he had previously made. Then he mounted a mule, and
with pick-axe and wash-pan "prospected" all over the
Pacific Coast, landing at last in Idaho. Here he had
again picked up a few thousands, and had just concluded
a freight contract with a mining company at Owyhee, that
he thought was going to "pay big." But it did not commence
until spring, and meanwhile he was trying his
hand at the lively business in Boisè. While on the
coast he had lived in California, Nevada, British America,
Washington, Oregon, and now Idaho; had camped out
in the mining regions; shot grizzlies in the Sierra Nevadas;
trapped beaver on the Columbia; wandered with
the Indians for months together; and "roughed it" generally.
He had but one eye       had lost the other, he said,
in a battle with the Indians, one arrow hitting him there,
and another passing through his body; yet he rode seventy
miles afterwards on a mule, supported by his comrades       the
pure air of that region and his Buckeye grit
carrying him through. This was his story, without its
embellishments. But he was a person of fine Western imagination;
and somewhat, I fear, addicted to "romancing."

But, good-bye, driver       John Wilful, well-named!
Good-bye, mustangs and donkeys! Good-bye, stage-coaches
and ambulances! Two thousand four hundred
miles of their drag and shake, of their rattle and bang,[Pg 248]
across the Plains and over the Mountains, had given us
our fill of them. We had had runaways, we had had breakdowns,
and about every stage experience, except a genuine
upset, and how we happened to escape that will always remain
a mystery. Our romance of stage-coaching, I must
say, was long since gone. There before us now lay the
lordly Columbia, with visions of steamboats and locomotives.
And looking back on our long jaunt, with all its
discomforts and dangers, it seemed for the moment as if
nothing could induce us to take it again. Hereafter, we
felt assured, we should appreciate the comfort and speed
of eastern travel more, and pray for the hastening of all
our Pacific Railroads. With a grand trunk line now
overland, through Utah, it can not be long before a
branch will be thrown thence to the Columbia, substantially
by the route we travelled; and when that is done,
the ride from Salt Lake to Umatilla will be soon accomplished.
The region nowhere presents any serious obstacle
to a railroad, except the Blue Mountains; and a
Latrobe, or a Dodge, would soon flank or conquer these.



[Pg 249]




CHAPTER XV.

DOWN THE COLUMBIA.


Umatilla was then a river town, of two or three
hundred houses, mostly frame. It was still the
chief point of departure from the Columbia for Idaho
and Montana, though Wallula       25 miles farther up       was
beginning to compete for this. Trade and travel that
season had not been large, and the whole region there complained
of dullness and stringency. The Metropolitan
was a fair hotel, with a goodly supply of eastern and California
papers, and seemed like a palace after our long
"roughing it" from the Missouri to the Columbia. It
was well patronized, especially by babies; and I do think
they were the worst enfans terribles I ever saw. One
doting mamma asked L. if he did not think her red-eyed,
puffy-faced youngster "a dear little cherub;" and
though he smiled approvingly, of course, he subsequently
vowed he should think better of King Herod hereafter.
The town already boasted one weekly newspaper, a public
school-house, and two young churches, with a goodly
complement of saloons and restaurants. Of course, the
patent-medicine venders had long since reached it. "S.
T. 1860 X. Drake's Plantation Bitters," was emblazoned
on every dead-wall, "in characters of living light," as it
had been from New York there. The year before I
had observed it all through the South, in over ten
thousand miles of travel there; and here it was again,[Pg 250]
mysterious and blatant, at the head of navigation on the
Pacific Coast. So, we had found it all through the
Rocky Mountains, at Salt Lake, and Boisè, as inevitable
as the stage-station and post-office; and the design was
the same huge cabalistic characters always. Another
advertisement accompanied us regularly across the Plains
to the Rocky Mountains; but "S. T. 1860 X. etc.," followed
us to the Columbia and beyond, and everywhere
seemed as universal as the air       as omnipresent as sunlight.

Indians were seen on the streets occasionally, but they
were usually in the last stages of dissipation and degradation.
They ought to be forbidden all such border towns,
as their life there ends only in ruin. The white population
consisted chiefly of Oregonians and Californians, of
every shade of character. The Micawber type, of course,
was not wanting. One afternoon, while writing in my
room, a seedy individual, whom we had met at Wells'
Springs, sauntered in, and, after some conversational
skirmishing, solicited, "the loan of five dollars." He had
been keeping a "hotel," he said, up in Owyhee, but the
miners hadn't paid up their board-bills, and he was now
"dead-broke," on his way back to Puget Sound. He
would give his due-bill, and would certainly remit to
me at San Francisco, but really couldn't tell exactly
when! He claimed to be "a son of old Massachusetts,
sir," and from Boston at that. But as he was odorous
afar of "needle-gun" whiskey, the Hub, I suspect, would
have haughtily repudiated him!

Ding! Dong! Puff! Puff! The steamer had come,
and Nov. 28th, we at length embarked for down the
Columbia. She was a little stern-wheel boat, scarcely
longer than your finger, called Nez Perce Chief, Capt.
Stump, master. Her fare to Fort Vancouver or Portland,
including railroad-portages, was $18 in coin, which at[Pg 251]
rates then current was equivalent to $25 in greenbacks.
Meals were extra, at a cost of $1,50 each, in currency,
besides. The distance to Portland was about 200 miles;
to the mouth of the Columbia, 100 or so more. We
found Capt. Stump a very obliging Oregonian, and
obtained much interesting information from him. His
boat was part of a line belonging to the Oregon Steam
Navigation Company, a gigantic corporation that controlled
all the navigable waters of the Columbia, and
with far-reaching enterprise was now seeking to connect
them with the headwaters of the Missouri. He said,
their boats could ascend to Umatilla all the year round,
except in mid-winter, when the Columbia sometimes
froze over for several weeks together, though not usually.
With good water, they could go up to Wallula, at the
mouth of the Walla-Walla, 25 miles farther, which they
usually did six months in the year. With very high
water, they could run up to Lewiston, at the junction of
the Snake and Clearwater, about 175 miles more, three
months in the year       making about 500 miles from the
sea in all. Above Lewiston, there was a bad cañon in
the Snake, with shoals and rapids for a hundred miles or
so to Farewell Bend; but after that, he thought, a light-draught
steamer might get up at least three hundred
miles farther, or within about 200 miles of Salt Lake, as
stated heretofore.

Clark's Fork of the Columbia, or the Columbia
proper, makes a sharp bend north at Wallula, and for
300 miles, he said, was unnavigable, until you reach Fort
Colville near the British line, when it trends east and
south, until it disappears in the far off wilds of Montana.
Just above Fort Colville, it became navigable again, and
a small boat was then running up to the Great Bend
region, over 200 miles farther, where good placer mines[Pg 252]
had been discovered (Kootenay) and worked a little.
This boat could connect with another, already plying on
Lake Pond Oreille (a part of Clark's Fork), and this with
still another then building, that it was believed with short
portages would extend navigation some 200 miles more,
or into the very heart of Montana, within two or three
hundred miles only of Fort Benton       the head of navigation
on the Missouri. These were weighty facts, marrying
the Pacific to the Atlantic; but Captain Stump thought
the O. S. N. company could accomplish them, or anything
else, indeed, it seriously undertook. Just now it
was bending its energies in that direction, and he said
would beat the Northern Pacific Railroad yet. No
doubt we have a fine country up there, near the British
America line, abounding in lakes and threaded with
rivers, and roomy enough for all enterprises, whether
railroad or steamboat.

Puff! Puff! And so we were off down the Columbia,
at last. How exquisitely pleasant, how cosy and delightful,
our little steamer seemed, after 2,400 miles of jolting
and banging by stage-coach and ambulance! The state-rooms
were clean and tidy, the meals well-cooked and
excellent, and we went steaming down the Columbia
without thought or care, as on "summer seas." Occasionally
rapids appeared, of a serious character; but as a
rule the river was broad and deep, majestic in size and
volume. On the banks were frequent Indian villages,
with their hardy little ponies browsing around       apparently
on nothing but sage-brush and cobble-stones.
These Indians fancied spotted or "calico" horses, as the
Oregonians called them, and very few of their ponies
were of a single color. They spend the summer mostly
in the Mountains, making long excursions in all directions;
but as winter approaches, they return to the[Pg 253]
Columbia, and eke out a precarious subsistence by fishing,
etc., till spring comes. Timber was scarce, and frequently
we saw numbers of them in canoes, paddling up and
down the river in search of drift-wood, for their winter's
supply of fuel. Past Owyhee rapids and the seething
caldron of Hell-Gate, we reached Celilo, eighty-five miles
from Umatilla, with its long warehouse (935 feet), and
its mosquito fleet of five or six pigmy steamers, that
formed the up-river line. Here we disembarked, and
took the Railroad around the "chutes" or rapids, some
fourteen miles, to still water again below. The shrill
whistle of the locomotive and the rattle of the cars were
delightful sounds, after our long exile from them, and
soon convinced us we were on the right road to civilization
again. This portage had formerly been made by pack-mules,
and then by wagons; but recently a railroad had
been constructed, after much hard blasting and costly
wall-work, and now "Riding on a rail," there, with the
Columbia boiling and roaring at your side, like the Rapids
above Niagara, was exhilarating and superb. At very
high water, these "chutes" or rapids somewhat disappear,
though they still continue very dangerous. No attempt
had been made to ascend them with a steamer; but the
spring before, Capt. Stump had safely descended them,
much against his will. It was high water in the Columbia,
with a strong current, and his boat drifting near the
rapids was suddenly sucked in, before he knew it.
Clearly, escape was impossible; so he put on all steam,
to give her steerage-way, and then headed down stream       neck
or nothing. There was a good deal of bumping
and thumping       it was a toss and a plunge, for awhile       and
everybody he feared was pretty badly scared; but
his gallant little boat ran the rapids for all that, and
reached still water below safely at last. It was a daring[Pg 254]
feat, and worthy of this brave Oregonian. Just now, the
Columbia was very low, rocks and reefs showing all
through the rapids       among, around, and over which the
waters boiled and rushed like a mill-race.

The locomotive carried us to the Dalles, at the foot
of the Rapids, a town of some two thousand inhabitants,
with a maturer civilization than any we had seen since
leaving Salt lake. It was but five or six years old; yet
it was already in its decrepitude. A "rush" of miners a
few years before, to alleged fine "diggings" near there,
had suddenly elevated it from an obscure landing into
quite a town; but the mines did not justify their promise,
and the Dalles was now at a stand-still, if not something
worse. "Mining stock" and "corner lots" had
gone down by the run, during the past year or two, and
her few merchants sat by their doors watching for customers
in vain. The enterprise of the town, however,
deserved a better fate. At the Umatilla House they gave
us an excellent supper, at a moderate price, and the hotel
itself would have been a credit to a much larger town
anywhere. The mines on John Day River, and other
dependencies of the Dalles, had formerly yielded $2,000,000
per year, and Congress had then voted a U. S. Mint
there. We could but sincerely hope it would be much
needed, some day or other.

Halting at the Dalles over night, the next morning
we took the side-wheel steamer Idaho, and ran down to
Upper Cascades       some fifty miles       through the heart of
the Cascade Mountains. Here we took the railroad
again for six miles       to flank more rapids       and at Lower
Cascades embarked on the W. G. Hunt, a large and elegant
side-wheel steamer, that some years before had come
"round the Horn," from New York. The Columbia,
soon issuing from the Mountains, now became a broad[Pg 255]
and majestic river, with good depth of water to the ocean
all the year round, and larger vessels even than the W.
G. Hunt might readily ascend to Lower Cascades, if
necessary. Our good boat, however, bore us bravely on
to Fort Vancouver, amidst multiplying signs of civilization
again; and as we landed there, we realized another
great link of our journey was over.

To return a little. Our sail down the Columbia,
and through the Cascade Mountains, altogether was a
notable one, and surpassed everything in the way of wild
and picturesque river-scenery, that we had seen yet.
Some have compared the Columbia to the Hudson; but
it is the Hudson many times magnified, and infinitely
finer. It is the Hudson, without its teeming travel, its
towns and villas, its civilization and culture; but with
many times its grandeur and sublimity. The noble
Palisades, famed justly throughout the world, sink into
insignificance before the stupendous walls of the Cascade
Range, which here duplicate them but on a far vaster
scale, for many miles together. Piled along the sky on
either side, up two or three thousand feet, for fifty miles
at a stretch, with only a narrow gorge between, the
Columbia whirls and boils along through this, in supreme
mightiness and power; while from the summit of the
great walls little streams here and there topple over, run
like lace for a time, then break into a million drops, and
finally come sifting down as mist, into the far depths
below. Some of these tiny cascades streaked the cyclopean
walls, like threads of silver, from top to bottom.
Others seemed mere webs of gossamer, and these the
wind at times caught up and swayed to and fro, like veils
fit for goddesses. These Mountains, all through the cañon
of the Columbia, abound with such fairy cascades;
whence their name. Just below Lower Cascades, where[Pg 256]
the river-bottoms open out a little, stands Castle Rock, a
huge red boulder of comparatively moderate dimensions
at the base, but seven hundred feet high. Its walls are
so perpendicular they seem inaccessible, and on top it is
covered with a thick growth of fir-trees. Its alleged
height appeared incredible at first, but on comparing it
with the gigantic firs at the base, and those on the
summit, the estimate seemed not unreasonable. All
along, the vast basaltic walls of the cañon are shaped and
fashioned into domes and turrets, ramparts and battlements;
and surely in point of picturesque grandeur and
effect, the Columbia would be hard to beat. We had
not seen the Yosemite yet. But already, we felt, the
Columbia compensated us for all our fatigue and danger,
in crossing the Continent; and it is not too much to say,
that all true lovers of the sublime and beautiful in nature
will yet wonder and worship here.

Before reaching the Dalles, and afterwards, we had
several superb views of glorious Mt. Hood. All good
Oregonians claim Hood is the highest peak in the United
States; but Californians boast their Shasta equals, while
Whitney out-tops it. A party of savans had recently
ascended Hood, and they reported the general range, of
which Hood is a part, as 4,400 feet above the sea; above
which Hood still shot up 13,000 feet. The summit proved
to be crescent-shaped, half a mile long, by from three feet
to fifty wide. The north front was a precipice, of naked
columnar rock, falling sheer down       perpendicularly       a
mile or more at a jump. On the west side was an
ancient crater, a thousand feet in depth from which
clouds of sulphurous smoke still issued occasionally. On
the flanks were true glaciers, with terminal and lateral
moraines, the same as among the Alps. Smoke
about his summit, just before we reached the Dalles,[Pg 257]
heralded a smart shock of earthquake there, and
no doubt he is the safety-valve of all that region. We
had caught a glimpse or two of Mt. Hood in descending
the Blue Mountains, and again from Umatilla: but it
was only for a moment, and usually with his night-cap
on. But in threading the cañon of the Columbia, one
morning as we rounded a rocky bastion, suddenly, a hundred
miles away, Hood stood before us, a vast pyramidal
peak, snow-clad from base to summit, resting in solitary
grandeur on a great mountain range       itself black
with firs and pines. From the apparent level or slight
undulation of the general Cascade Range, Hood quickly
shoots up loftily into the sky, individual and alone, and
serene and unapproachable dominates the far-stretching
landscape. From all points of view, whether
descending the Columbia, where the cañon often frames
him in like a picture, or at Fort Vancouver, where he
stands superb and glorious against the sapphire sky,
Hood always gives you the impression of vast loftiness,
of serene majesty, of heaven-kissing superiority and
power, and Oregonians may well be proud of him.
Butman's two pictures of Hood are both good, but neither
does justice to his great merits. The White Mountains
and the Alleghanies are well enough in their way. The
Rocky Mountains are indeed noble and majestic. But
once see Hood, and all these pall upon the mind, and he
alone rules the memory and imagination afterwards. Up
the Columbia and down, off at sea, and pretty much all
over Oregon, Hood is a great and magnificent landmark;
and, of itself, is well worth a trip across the continent.


   
   
   MOUNT HOOD.


Past the Cascade Mountains, we came suddenly out
into a new region, and a totally different climate. From
Umatilla to the Mountains we had the same clear atmosphere
and perfect sky, that we had found everywhere[Pg 258]
from the Plains to the Columbia, substantially. The
country naturally was the same barren and sterile region
as at Salt Lake, abounding only in sage-brush and grease-wood;
and, indeed, the whole internal basin of the continent,
from the Rocky Mountains to the Sierra Nevadas,
and from British America down to Mexico, appeared to
be of this same general character       from want of regular
rains in summer. Over most of this vast region, there
had been no rains for weeks, or indeed months; and for
days together as we journeyed along, we had never seen
a cloud or mist even, to mar the absolute ultramarine of
those perfect skies. But now, in descending the Columbia,
as we approached the Mountains, we descried the
clouds on their western slope ever trying to float over,
but never apparently succeeding, their white discs gleaming
in the sun; and when we drew nearer, we beheld a
fleecy mist drifting up the Columbia, and streaming
eastward like a pennon. Nearer still, we encountered a
stiff breeze sweeping through the cañon, as through a
funnel; and when we got well down into the jaws of the
gorge, it needed all our steam, as well as the strong westward
current to carry us forward. Sometimes, it was
said, the Columbia just here becomes so rough, because
of this conflicting wind and current, as to cause real sea-sickness
on the boats, and occasionally indeed they have
to cast anchor, unable to descend. Farther down, this
mist thickened into rain, and when we got fairly through
and out of the Mountains, (it raining most of the way), we
debouched into the Coast Region, where it was still raining
steadily, as it had been for many days, and continued
to for weeks together afterwards. As soon as we struck
the rain, trees and herbage at once made their appearance,
clothing the mountains and bottoms everywhere; lichens
and mosses again decorated all the rocks; and when we[Pg 259]
got well out of the Mountains, behold such forests of fir,
pine, cedar, oak, etc., as never appear East. In half a
day, you may thus pass from a comparatively rainless to
a thoroughly rainy region; and in winter from a severely
cold, to a comparatively moderate climate. The contrast
is very striking, and you soon feel it keenly in every
sense. Your eyes glaze, your skin becomes moist, and if
there is a weak spot about your lungs, you will find it
out very quickly. The proximity of the Pacific, of
course, explains it all       the warm, humid winds from
which sweep up against the Cascade Range, but find in
their lofty crest an insurmountable barrier. If light
enough to ascend, their wealth of moisture is condensed
as rain or snow along the mountain sides or summit, by
the cold of the upper regions, as with your hand you
squeeze a sponge; and, consequently, they topple over the
Range dry and clear       to curse a vast region beyond with
their sterility. If unable to ascend, they career along
the western slope of the Mountains, and hover over the
Coast Region generally, literally deluging Western Oregon
and Washington, at certain seasons of the year, with
rains and fogs. The year before, at Fort Vancouver,
they had had one hundred and twenty consecutive days
of rain, in one year, without counting the intervening
showers; and they said, it wasn't "much of a year for rain"
either! Another year, they didn't see the sun there for
eighty days together, without reckoning the occasional
fogs. No wonder the Oregonians are called "Web-Feet."
They do say, the children there are all born web-footed,
like ducks and geese, so as to paddle about, and thus get
along well in that amphibious region. Perhaps this is
rather strong, even for Darwinism; but I can safely
vouch for Oregon's all-sufficing rains and fogs, whatever
their effects on the species.

[Pg 260]

Our fellow-passengers down the Columbia were chiefly
returning miners, going below to winter and recruit; but
rough as they were and merry at times, they were, as a
rule, self-respecting and orderly. Our Fenian friends,
who had raced with us down Powder River and Grande
Ronde Valleys and across the Blue Mountains, turned
up here again       "Shanks," "Fatty," and all       and subsequently
embarked on the same steamer with us at
Portland for San Francisco. A few Chinamen also were
on board; but they behaved civilly, and were treated
kindly.

CHAPTER XVI.

FORT VANCOUVER TO SAN FRANCISCO.


Fort Vancouver is an old Government Post,
established in 1849, when Washington Territory
was still a part of Oregon, and all the great region there
was yet a wilderness. The village of Vancouver, a
parasite on its outskirts, had grown up gradually; but
had long since been distanced by Portland, across the
Columbia in Oregon. A fine plateau, with a bold shore,
made the Post everything desirable; but back of the
post-grounds, the unbroken forest was still everywhere
around it. It was now Headquarters of the Department
of the Columbia, and the base for all military operations
in that section. Here troops and supplies were gathered,
for all the posts up the Columbia and its tributaries;
though Portland, rather, seemed to be the natural brain
of all that region. So, too, it controlled and supplied
the forts at the mouth of the Columbia and the posts on
Puget Sound; and, indeed, was of prime importance to
the Government in many ways.

Gen. Steele, in command of the Department, was an
old Regular officer, who during the war commanded first
in Missouri, afterwards around Vicksburg, then in
Arkansas, and always with ability. He is now no more
(dying in 1868), but some things he related in speaking
of the war seem worth preserving. He said, Gen. Sherman
was undoubtedly a great soldier; but he owed[Pg 262]
much to the rough schooling of his first campaigns,
and improved from year to year. He said, Sherman
in '62 was "scary" about Price's movements in Missouri
and cited as an instance, that he once ordered
the depot at Rolla broken up and the troops withdrawn,
for fear Price would "gobble up" everybody and everything.
He (Steele) then a Colonel, but in command at
Rolla, appealed to Gen. Halleck, and was allowed to
remain; and subsequently Sherman, with his customary
frankness, admitted his mistake. So, he said, Sherman
in '63, when campaigning around Vicksburg, had little
confidence in Grant's famous movement to the rear, via
Grand Gulf and the Big Black, though the results were
so magnificent. He said Sherman was somewhere up
the Yazoo, with Porter and the gun-boats, and from there
wrote him (Steele), in command of the Corps during
Sherman's absence, that the proposed movement was
perilous, and would probably fail, ruining them all; but,
"nevertheless," he added, right loyally, "We must support
Grant cordially and thoroughly, dear Steele, whatever
happens." Subsequently, after they had landed at
Grand Gulf       repulsed Pemberton and hurled him back
on Vicksburg       cleaned Joe Johnston out of Jackson
and chased him out of the country       and were crossing
the Big Black in triumph, the movement now apparently
a sure thing, Sherman and he were lying down to rest a
little, at a house near the bridge, while the troops were
filing over. Presently, an orderly announced Gen.
Grant and staff riding by, when Sherman instantly
sprang up, and rushing out of the house bareheaded
seized Grant by the hand, and shaking it very warmly exclaimed,
"I congratulate you, General, with all my heart,
on the success of your movement. And, by heaven,
sir, the movement is yours, too; for nobody else would[Pg 263]
endorse it!" He added, he never heard of Sherman's
"protesting" against the movement, as reported afterwards
in the newspapers, and didn't believe he ever had       "was
too soldierly, by far, for that"       but he (Steele),
knew all the facts at the time, and the above was about
the Truth of History.

Poor Steele! He was a true Army bachelor, fond of
horses and dogs, and a connoisseur in both. He was
besides a man of fine intelligence, and after dinner told a
camp-story capitally. I remember several he told, with
great gusto, while we shared his cosy quarters at Vancouver;
but have not space for them here. Afterwards,
we met him again in San Francisco, on leave of absence,
the beloved of all army circles, and the favorite of society.
May he rest in peace!

But to return to Fort Vancouver. We spent several
days there very pleasantly, getting the bearings of things
from there as a centre, and were loath to leave its hospitable
quarters. It was now the first week in December;
but the grapes were still hanging on the vines at
Maj. N.'s quarters, and all about the post the grass was
springing fresh and green, as in April in the East.
We had fog or rain, or both together, about every day;
no heavy down-pours, however, but gentle drizzles, as if
the Oregon-Washington sky was only a great sieve, with
perpetual water on 'tother side. They said, this was
their usual weather from fall to spring, and then they
had a delightful summer; though sometimes occasional
snow-storms, sweeping down from the Mountains in January
or February, gave them a taste of winter. Such
snows, however, were light, and never lasted long. It
seems, the Gulf Stream of the Pacific, sweeping up from
the tropics, bears the isothermal lines so far north on this
coast, that here at Fort Vancouver in the latitude of[Pg 264]
Montreal, they have the climate of the Carolinas in winter,
with little of their excessive heats in summer.
Walla-Walla, in latitude 46°, boasts the range of Washington,
D. C. in 39°; and San Francisco, on the line of
New York, claims the climate of Savannah. One evening
while there, after a day of weary rain, the clouds
suddenly broke away, and just at sunset we caught
another noble view of Mount Hood again. A thin, veil-like
cloud enrobed his feet, extending much of the
way up; but above, his heaven-kissing head rose right
regally, and his snowy crown became transfigured
through all the changes       from pink to purple, and into
night       as the day faded out. He looked still loftier
and grander, than we had yet seen him, as if piercing
the very sky, and was really superb. Aye, superbus.
Haughty, imperial, supremely proud       which is about what
the Romans meant, if I mistake not.

A ride of six miles down the Columbia, on the little
steamer Fanny Troup, and then twelve miles up the
Willamette, landed us at Portland, Oregon, the metropolis
of all that region. The distance from Fort Vancouver,
as the crow flies, is only about six miles, but by
water it is fully eighteen, as above stated. Here we found
a thrifty busy town, of eight or ten thousand people, with
all the eastern evidences of substantial wealth and prosperity.
Much of the town was well built, and the rest was
rapidly changing for the better. Long rows of noble
warehouses lined the wharves, many of the stores were
large and even elegant, and off in the suburbs handsome
residences were already springing up, notwithstanding
the abounding stumps nearly everywhere. The town
seemed unfortunately located, the river-plateau was so
narrow there; but just across the Willamette was East
Portland, a growing suburb, with room plenty and to[Pg 265]
spare. A ferry-boat, plying constantly, connected the
two places, and made them substantially one. Portland
already boasted water, gas, and Nicholson pavements;
and had more of a solid air and tone, than any city we
had seen since leaving the Missouri. The rich black soil,
on which she stands, makes her streets in the rainy
season, as then, sloughs or quagmires, unless macadamised
or Nicholsoned; but she was at work on these, and
they promised soon to be in good condition. Several
daily papers, two weekly religious ones, and a fine
Mercantile Library, all spoke well for her intelligence
and culture, while her Public School buildings and her
Court-House would have been creditable anywhere. The
New England element was noticeable in many of her
citizens, and Sunday came here once a week, as regularly
as in Boston or Bangor. The Methodists and Presbyterians
both worshipped in goodly edifices, and the
attendance at each the Sunday we were there was large
and respectable.

Being the first city of importance north of San
Francisco, and the brain of our northwest coast, Portland
was full of energy and vigor, and believed thoroughly
in her future. The great Oregon Steam Navigation
Company had their headquarters here, and poured
into her lap all the rich trade of the Columbia and its
far-reaching tributaries, that tap Idaho, Montana, and
even British America itself. So, also, the coastwise
steamers, from San Francisco up, all made Portland their
terminus, and added largely to her commerce. Back of
her lay the valley of the Willamette, and the rich heart
of Oregon; and her wharves, indeed, were the gateways
to thousands of miles of territory and trade, in all directions.
Nearer to the Sandwich Islands and China, by
several hundred miles, than California, she had already[Pg 266]
opened a brisk trade with both, and boasted that she
could sell sugars, teas, silks, rice, etc., cheaper than San
Francisco. Victoria, the British city up on Puget Sound,
had once been a dangerous rival; but Portland had
managed to beat her out of sight, and claimed now she
would keep her beaten. It was Yankee Doodle against
John Bull; and, of course, in such a contest, Victoria
went to the wall!

It seemed singular, however, that the chief city of
the northwest coast should be located there       a hundred
miles from the sea, and even then twelve miles up the
little Willamette. Your first thought is, Portland has
no right to be at all, where she now is. But, it appears,
she originally got a start, from absorbing and
controlling the large trade of the Willamette, and when
the Columbia was opened up to navigation rapidly grew
into importance, by her heavy dealings in flour, wool,
cattle, lumber, etc. The discovery of mines in Idaho
and Montana greatly invigorated her, and now she had
got so much ahead, and so much capital and brains were
concentrated here, that it seemed hard for any new place
to compete with her successfully.[14] Moreover, we were
told, there are no good locations for a town along the
Columbia from the ocean up to the Willamette, nor on
the Willamette up to Portland. Along the Columbia,
from the ocean up, wooded hills and bluffs come quite
down to the water, and the whole back country, as a
rule, is still a wilderness of pines and firs; while the
Willamette up to Portland, they said, was apt to overflow
its banks in high water. Hence, Portland seemed
secure in her supremacy, at least for years to come,
though no doubt at no distant day a great city will rise[Pg 267]
on Puget Sound, that will dominate all that coast, up to
Sitka and down to San Francisco. From want of time,
we failed to reach the Posts on Puget's Sound; but all
accounts agreed, that       land-locked by Vancouver's and
San Juan islands       we there have one of the largest and
most magnificent harbors in the world. With the
Northern Pacific Railroad linking it to Duluth and the
great lakes, commerce will yet seek its great advantages;
and the Boston, if not the New York, of the Pacific will
yet flourish where now are only the wilds of Washington.
The Sound already abounded in saw-mills, and the
ship-timber and lumber of Washington we subsequently
found famed in San Francisco, and throughout California.
She was then putting lumber down in San Francisco,
cheaper than the Californians could bring it from their
own foot-hills, and her magnificent forests of fir and
pine promised yet to be a rare blessing to all the Pacific
Coast.

The Portlanders, of course, were energetic, go-ahead
men, from all parts of the North, with a good sprinkling
from the South. Outside of Portland, however, the Oregonians
appeared to be largely from Missouri, and to have
retained many of their old Missouri and so-called "conservative"
ideas still. All through our Territories, indeed,
Missouri seemed to have been fruitful of emigrants.
Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, were everywhere well represented;
but Missouri led, especially in Idaho and Oregon.
This fact struck us repeatedly, and was well accounted
for by friend Meacham's remark (top of the Blue Mountains),
"the left wing of Price's army is still encamped
in this region." The tone of society, in too many places,
seemed to be of the Nasby order, if not worse. No
doubt hundreds of deserters and draft-sneaks, from both
armies, had made their way into those distant regions;[Pg 268]
and then, besides, the influence of our old officials, both
civil and military, had long been pro-slavery, and this
still lingered among communities, whom the war had not
touched, and among whom school-houses and churches
were still far too few. Of course, we met some right noble
and devoted Union men everywhere, especially in Colorado;
but elsewhere, and as a rule, they did not strike
us as numerous, nor as very potential. In saying this, I
hope I am not doing the Territories injustice; but this is
how their average public opinion impressed a passing
traveller, and other tourists we met en route remarked the
same thing.

Here at Portland, John Chinaman turned up again,
and seemed to be behaving thoroughly well. At Boisè,
we found these heathen paying their stage-fare, and riding
down to the Columbia, while many Caucasians were
walking, and here at Portland they appeared alike thrifty
and prosperous. Their advent here had been comparatively
recent, and there was still much prejudice against
them, especially among the lower classes; but they were
steadily winning their way to public favor by their sobriety,
their intelligence and thrift, and good conduct generally.
Washing and ironing, and household service generally,
seemed to be their chief occupations, and nearly
everybody gave them credit for industry and integrity.
Mr. Arrigoni, the proprietor of our hotel (and he was
one of the rare men, who know how to "keep a hotel"),
spoke highly of their capacity and honesty, and said he
wanted no better servants anywhere. One of them, not
over twenty-one, had a contract to do the washing and
ironing for the Arrigoni House, at a hundred dollars per
month, and was executing it with marked fidelity. He
certainly did his work well, judging by what we saw of
the hotel linen. In walking about the town, we occasionally[Pg 269]
came upon their signs, over the door of some
humble dwelling, as for example, "Ling       Ching, Laundry;"
"Hop Kee, washing and ironing;" "Ching
Wing, shoemaker;" "Chow Pooch, doctor;" etc. As
far as we could see, they appeared to be intent only on
minding their own business, and as a class were doing
more hearty honest work by far, than most of their bigoted
defamers. We could not refrain from wishing
them well, they were so sober, industrious, and orderly;
for, after all, are not these the first qualities of good citizenship
the world over?

We left Portland, Dec. 11th, on the good steamer
Oriflamme, for San Francisco. For a wonder, it was a
calm clear day, with the bracing air of our Octobers in
the east, and as we glided out of the Willamette into
the noble Columbia, we had a last superb view of Mts.
Jefferson, Hood, Adams and St. Helens all at the same
time. Sometimes Rainier also is visible from here, but
ordinarily only Hood and St. Helens appear. We
thought this the finest view of these splendid snow-peaks
that we had had yet, and it seemed strange no artist had
yet attempted to group them all in one grand landscape,
from the mouth of the Willamette as a stand-point.
Or, if he could not get them all in, he might at least combine
Hood and St. Helens. The breadth and scope,
the grandeur and sublimity of such a picture, with the
Columbia in the foreground, and the great range of the
Cascade Mountains in the perspective, would make a
painting, that would live forever. We watched them all,
with the naked eye and through the glass, until we were
far down the Columbia, and to the last, Hood was the same


"Dread ambassador from earth to heaven!"


How he soared and towered, beyond and above everything,[Pg 270]
as if communing with the Almighty! Lofty as
were the rest, they seemed small by his majestic side.
St. Helens, however, though not so imperial, was perhaps
more simply and chastely beautiful. An unbroken
forest of fir, deep green verging into black, girt her feet,
while above she "swelled vast to heaven," a perfect snow
sphere rather than cone, whose celestial whiteness dazzled
the eye. She looked like a virgin's or a nun's white
breast, unsullied by sin, and standing sharply out against
the glorious azure of that December sky, seemed indeed
a perfect emblem of purity and beauty. Farther down the
river, we detected a light smoke or vapor, drifting
dreamily away from her summit, and Capt. Conner of
the Oriflamme said this was not unusual, though St.
Helens was not rated as a volcano. He thought it steam
or vapor, caused by internal heat melting the snow,
rather than smoke; but the effect was about the same.

We reached the mouth of the Columbia, the same
evening; but Capt. Conner thought it risky to venture
over the bar, until morning. The next morning early,
we lifted anchor, and steamed down to Astoria       a
higgledy-piggledy village, of only four or five hundred
inhabitants still, though begun long before prosperous
Portland. Her anchorage seemed fair; but ashore the
land abounded in a congeries of wooded bluffs and ridges,
that evidently made a town or farms there difficult, if not
impossible. A short street or two of straggling houses,
propped along the hillsides, was about all there was of
Astoria; and yet she was a port of entry, with a custom-house
and full corps of officials, while Portland with all
her enterprise and commerce was not, and could not get
to be. What her custom-officials would have to do,
were it not for the business of Portland, it seemed
pretty hard to say. A venture of John Jacob Astor's a[Pg 271]
half century before, as a trading post with the Indians,
she had never become of much importance, because
lacking a good back country; and it appeared, had no
future now, because wanting a good town-site. This
was unfortunate perhaps for Oregon, and the whole
Columbia region; but over it Portland rejoiced, and continued
to wax fat.

Of course, it had begun to rain again, and by the
time we had passed the ordeal of the custom-house at
Astoria, the weather had thickened up into a drizzly fog,
that caused Capt. C. much anxiety       especially, when he
observed the barometer steadily going down. The bar
of the Columbia, always bad, is peculiarly rough in
winter, and only the voyage before the Oriflamme had
to lay to here, nearly a week, unable to venture out.
Her provisions became exhausted, and she had to "clean
out" Astoria, and all the farm-houses up and down the
river for miles, before she finally got away. Our
company of four hundred passengers had no fancy for an
experience of this sort, and "dirty" as the weather
promised to be, Capt. C. at last decided to try the bar,
even if we had to return, hoping to find better skies
when fairly afloat in blue water. Our engines once in
motion, we soon ran down past Forts Stevens and Cape
Disappointment, at the mouth of the Columbia, on the
Oregon and Washington sides respectively, with the black
throats of their heavy cannon gaping threateningly at us.
Both forts seem necessary there, as they completely command
the mouth of the Columbia, and so hold the key
to all that region. But life in them must be an almost
uninterrupted series of rains and fogs, with the surf forever
thundering at your feet, and one can but pity the
officers and men really exiled there. Gathered about
the flag-staff or lounging along the ramparts, they gazed[Pg 272]
wistfully at us as we steamed past; and already in the
distance we could see the white-caps, racing in over the
dreaded bar. Heading for the north channel, we put all
steam on, and once out of the jaws of the Columbia were
soon fairly a-dancing on the bar. The wind and tide
both strong, were both dead ahead, which made our
exit about as bad, as could well be. The sea went
hissing by, or broke into huge white-caps all about
us. The engines creaked and groaned, and at times
seemed to stand still, as if exhausted with the struggle.
The good ship Oriflamme pitched and tossed, battling
with the waves like a practiced pugilist, yet ever
advanced, though sometimes apparently drifting shoreward.
At one period, indeed, Capt. C. feared we would
have to about ship and run for the Columbia       we progressed
so slowly; but something of a lull in the wind
just then helped us on, and at last we saw by the receding
head-lands, that we were fairly over the bar and out
into the broad Pacific. We congratulated ourselves in
thus getting speedily to sea; but our tussle on the bar
had been too much for the majority of our passengers,
and soon our bulwarks were thronged with scores "casting
up their accounts" with Father Neptune. Sea-sickness,
that deathliest of all human ailments, had set in,
and our "rough and tumble" with the waves had been
so sharp, that many began to suffer from it, who declared
they had never been attacked before. A notable New
Yorker, a brawny son of Æsculapius at that, bravely
protested, that sea-sickness was "Only a matter of the
imagination. Anyone can overcome it. It only requires
a vigorous exercise of the will." But, unfortunately for
his theory, soon afterwards he himself became the sickest
person on board, not excepting the ladies. My own
experience ended with a qualm or two; but the majority[Pg 273]
of our passengers suffered very much, for several days.
Our steamer really had accommodations for only about one
hundred passengers; but some four hundred had crowded
aboard of her at Portland, mostly miners eager to get
"below" to winter, and those who had no state-rooms
now "roughed it" pitiably. They lay around loose       on
deck, in the cabin, in the gang-way, everywhere       the
most disconsolate-looking fellows I ever saw, outside of a
yellow-fever hospital. The few ladies aboard were even
sicker; but these all had state-rooms, and kept them
mostly for the voyage.

The weather continued raw and the sea rough, most of
the way down the coast, and our voyage of eight hundred
miles from Portland to San Francisco, as a whole,
could hardly be called agreeable. We had fog, and rain,
and head-winds all the way down, and with the exception
of a day or two, it was really cold and uncomfortable.
The steam-heating apparatus of the vessel was out of
order, and the only place for us all to warm was at a
register in the Social Hall       a narrow little cabin on deck,
that would not accommodate over thirty persons at the
farthest. There was a similar place for the ladies, but
they usually filled this themselves. Groups huddled
here all day, smoking and talking, and when the weather
permitted also swarmed about the smoke-stacks. And
then, besides, as already stated, our ship was badly
overcrowded. Of our 400 passengers, less than a quarter
had state-rooms, and the rest were left to shift for
themselves. After the sea-sickness began to abate, we
filled two or three tables every meal; and when bed-time
came, mattrasses thronged the cabin from end to end.
How it was down in the steerage, where the miners and
Chinamen mostly congregated, one need not care to imagine.
Fortunately great-coats and blankets abounded, or[Pg 274]
many would have suffered much. We found many
choice spirits aboard, and in spite of wind and weather
enjoyed ourselves, after all, very fairly. When it did not
rain too hard, we walked the deck and talked for hours;
and when everything else failed, we always found something
of interest in the gulls that followed us by hundreds,
and the great frigate-birds with their outstretched
pinions, and the ever-rolling boundless sea. Our table-fare
was always profuse and generally excellent, especially
the Oregon apples and pears they gave us for dessert;
and had it not been for our broken heating apparatus,
no doubt we would have got along very satisfactorily
after all, all things considered.

We arrived off the Golden Gate, late at night, Dec.
14th, only four days out from Portland; but the sea was
still so rough, that we feared to venture in. Next morning,
however, when the mist broke away a little, we up steam
and headed again for San Francisco. We had a tough
time getting in, nearly as bad as getting out of the Columbia.
We had to combat a strong wind dead-ahead, and
to wrestle with a heavy sea. But, nevertheless, our good
ship held on her course bravely; and at last, weathering
Point Reyes, and rounding Fort Point, we steamed up
past frowning Alcatraz, and with booming cannon dropped
anchor at the Company's wharf. The storm we had
encountered was reported as one of the worst known on
the coast for years, and we were glad once more to touch
terra firma, and strike hands with a live civilization. In
a half hour we were ashore and at the Occidental, a hostelry
worthy of San Francisco or any other city.

And so, we had reached California at last. All hail,
the Golden Gate! And 'Frisco, plucky, vain young
metropolis, hail! Bragging, boasting, giddy as you are,
there is much excuse for you. Surely, with your marvellous[Pg 275]
growth, and far-reaching schemes, you have a
right to call yourself the New York of the Pacific Coast,
if that contents you.



[Pg 276]




CHAPTER XVII.

SAN FRANCISCO.


Geography demonstrates the matchless position
of San Francisco, as metropolis of the Pacific
coast, and assures her supremacy perhaps forever. The
Golden Gate, a strait six miles long by one wide, with
an average depth of twenty-four fathoms       seven fathoms
at the shallowest point       is her pathway to the Pacific.
At her feet stretches her sheltered and peerless bay,
fifty miles long by five wide, with Oakland as her
Brooklyn just across it. Beyond, the Sacramento and
the San Joaquin empty their floods, the drainage of the
Sierra Nevadas, and afford channels for trade with much
of the interior. Her system of bays       San Pablo, Suisun,
and San Francisco proper       contain a superficial area
of four hundred square miles, of which it is estimated,
eight feet in depth pour in and out of the Golden Gate
every twenty-four hours. On all that coast, for thousands
of miles, she seems to be the only really great harbor; and
then, besides, all enterprise and commerce have so centred
here, that hereafter it will be difficult, if not impossible, to
wrest supremacy from her. Until we reached Salt-Lake,
New York everywhere ruled the country, and all business
ideas turned that way; but from there on, the influence
of Gotham ceased, and everything tended to "'Frisco,"
as many lovingly called her. This was her general name,
indeed, for short, all over the Pacific coast; though the[Pg 277]
Nevadans spoke of her, as "the Bay" still. The city
itself stands on a peninsula of shifting dunes or sand-hills,
at the mouth of the harbor, much the same as if
New York were built at Sandy Hook. It was a great
mistake, that its founders did not locate it at Benicia, or
Vallejo, or somewhere up that way, where it would have
been out of the draft of the Golden Gate, had better
wharfage, and been more easily defended. But, it seems,
when the gold fever first broke out, in 1849, the early
vessels all came consigned to Yerba Buena, as the little
hamlet was then called; and as their charter-parties would
not allow them to ascend the Bay farther, their cargoes
were deposited on the nearest shore, and hence came San
Francisco. It took a year or more then to hear from
New York or London, and before further advices were
received, so great was the rush of immigrants, the town
was born and the city named. Benicia tried to change
things afterwards; but 'Frisco had got the start, and
kept it, in spite of her false location. Her military defences
are Fort Point at the mouth of the Golden Gate,
Fort San Josè farther up the harbor, and Alcatraz on an
island square in the entrance, which with other works
yet to be constructed would cross-fire and command all
the approaches by water, thus rendering the city fairly
impregnable.

From the first, she seems to have had a fight with
the sand-hills, and she was still pluckily maintaining it.
She had cut many of them down, and hurled them into
the sea, to give her a better frontage. Her "made" land
already extended out several blocks, and the work was still
going on. With a great penchant for right-angles, as if
Philadelphia was her model city, she was pushing her
streets straight out, in all directions, no matter what
obstacles intervened. One would have thought, that[Pg 278]
with an eye to economy, as well as the picturesque,
she would have flanked some of her sand-hills by leading
her streets around them; but no! she marched straight
at and over them, with marvellous audacity and courage,
like the Old Guard at Waterloo, or the Boys in Blue at
Chattanooga. Some were inaccessible to carriages;
still she pushed straight on, and left the inhabitants to
clamber up to their eyrie-like residences, as best they
could. Many of these hills were still shifting sand, and
in places lofty fences had been erected as a protection
against sand-drifts; just as our railroads East sometimes
build fences, as a protection against snow-drifts. The
sand seemed of the lightest and loosest character, and
when the breeze rose filled the atmosphere at all exposed
points. And yet, when properly irrigated, it really
seemed to produce about everything abundantly. While
inspecting one of the harbor forts, I saw a naked drift
on one side of a sand-fence, and on the other a flower-garden
of the most exquisite character, while just beyond
was a vegetable and fruit-garden, that would have astonished
people East. A little water had worked the miracle,
and this a faithful wind-mill continued to pump up, from
time to time as needed. Towards the south, the sand-hills
seemed less of an obstruction, and thither the
city was now drifting very rapidly. Real-estate there
was constantly on the rise, and houses were springing
up as if by magic in a night. The city-front, heretofore
much confined, was now extending southward accordingly.
It was about decided to build a sea-wall of solid
granite, all along the front, two miles or more in length,
at a cost of from two to three millions of dollars. This
expenditure seemed large; but, it was maintained, was
not too great for the vast and growing commerce of the
city.

[Pg 279]

But a few years before, it was a common thing for
ships to go East empty or in ballast, for want of a return
cargo; but in 1867 San Francisco shipped grain alone to
the amount of thirteen millions of dollars, and of manufactures
about as much more. Here are some other
statistics that are worth one's considering. In 1849,
then called Yerba Buena, she numbered perhaps 1,000
souls, all told; in 1869, nearly 200,000. In 1868, 59,000
passengers arrived by sea, and only 25,000 departed,
leaving a net gain of 34,000. The vessels which entered
the bay that year, numbered 3,300, and measured over
1,000,000 tons. She exported 4,000,000 sacks of wheat
that year, and half a million barrels of flour. Her
total exports of all kinds were estimated at not less than
$70,000,000, and her imports about the same. Her sales
of real-estate aggregated $27,000,000, and of mining
and other stocks $115,000,000, on which she paid over
$5,000,000 of dividends. The cash value of her real and
personal property was estimated at $200,000,000. She
sent away six tons of gold, and forty tons of silver every
month, and in all since 1849 had poured into the coffers of
the world not less than $1,030,000,000.[15] Her net-work
of far-reaching and gigantic enterprises already embraced
the whole Pacific Coast, northward to Alaska and southward
to Panama, while beyond she stretched out her invisible
arms to Japan and China, and shook hands with the
Orient.

One cloudless morning, after days of dismal drizzle,
an enthusiastic Forty-Niner took me up Telegraph Hill,
and bade me "view the landscape o'er!" I remembered
when a school-boy reading Dana's "Two Years before
the Mast," in which he speaks so contemptuously
of Yerba Buena, and its Mexican Rip Van Winkles.[Pg 280]
What a change here since then! Off to the west rolled the
blue Pacific, sea and sky meeting everywhere. Then
came Fort Point, with its formidable batteries, commanding
the Golden Gate; and then the old Presidio, with
the stars and stripes waving over it. Farther inland
were the stunted live-oaks and gleaming marbles of Lone
Mountain Cemetery, with the Broderick Monument rising
over all. Then came the live, busy, bustling, pushing city,
with its quarter of a million of inhabitants nearly, soon to
be a million, its wharves thronged with the ships of all
nations, but with harbor-room to spare sufficient to float
the navies of the world. Beyond, lay Oakland, loveliest of
suburbs, smiling in verdure and beauty, with Mount
Diabolo towering in the distance       his snow-crowned
summit flashing in the sunlight. The Sacramento and
Stockton boats, from the heart of California were already
in. Past the Golden Gate, and up the noble bay, with
boom of welcoming cannon, came the Hong Kong
steamer fresh from Japan. The Panama steamer, with
her fires banked and flag flying, was just ready to cast off.
While off to the south, a long train of cars, from down
the bay and San Josè, came thundering in. A hundred
church spires pierced the sky; the smoke from numberless
mills and factories, machine-shops and foundries,
drifted over the harbor; the horse-car bells tinkled on
every side       the last proofs of American progress       and
all around us were the din and boom of Yankee energy,
and thrift, and go-ahead-ative-ness, in place of the old
Rip Van Winkleism. I don't wonder, that all good
Pacific Coasters believe in San Francisco, and expect to
go there when they die! Her hotels, her school-houses,
her churches, her Bank of California, her Wells-Fargo
Express, her Mission Woollen Mills, her lines of ocean
steam-ships, and a hundred other things, all suggest great[Pg 281]
wealth and brains; and yet they are only the first fruits
of nobler fortune yet to come. She is what Carlyle
might call an undeniable fact, a substantial verity; and,
in spite of her "heavy job of work," moves onward to
empire with giant strides. She contained already fully
a third of the population of the whole state of California,
and was "lifting herself up like a young lion" in all
enterprises       at all times and everywhere       on the Pacific
slope.

Her faulty location, however, gives her a climate,
that can scarcely be called inviting, notwithstanding all
that Californians claim for their climate generally. It is
true, the range of the thermometer there indicates but a
moderate variation of temperature, with neither snow
nor frost, usually. But her continual rains in winter,
and cold winds and fogs in summer, must be very trying
to average nerves and lungs. We found it raining on
our arrival there in December, with the hills surrounding
the bay already turning green; and it continued to rain
and drizzle right along, pretty much all the time, until
we departed for Arizona in February. Sometimes it
would break away for an hour or two, and the sun would
come out resplendently, as if meaning to shine forever;
and then, suddenly, it would cloud over, and begin to
drizzle and rain again, as if the whole heavens were
only a gigantic sieve. Really, it did rain there sometimes
the easiest of any place I ever saw       not excepting
Fort Vancouver. Going out to drive, or on business,
we got caught thus several times, and learned the wisdom
of carrying stout umbrellas, or else wearing bang-up
hats and water-proof coats, like true Californians.
Once, for a fortnight nearly, it rained in torrents, with
but little intermission, and then the whole interior
became flooded       bridges were washed away, roads submerged,[Pg 282]
etc. In the midst of this, one night, we had a
sharp passage of thunder and lightning       a phenomenon
of rare occurrence on that coast       followed by a slight
earthquake, and then it rained harder than ever. But
at last, the winter rains came to an end, as all things
must, and then we had indeed some superb weather,
worthy of Italy or Paradise. Californians vowed their
winter had been an unusual one; that their January was
usually good, and their February very fine; but, of
course, things must be reported as we found them. As
a rule, nobody seemed to mind the perpetual drizzle, so
to speak; but with slouched hats and light overcoats, or
infrequent umbrellas, everybody tramped the streets, as
business or pleasure called, and the general health of the
city continued good. The few fair days we had in January
and early February were as soft and balmy, as our
May or June, and all 'Frisco made the most of them.
The ladies literally swarmed along Montgomery street,
resplendent in silks and jewelry, and all the drives about
the city       especially the favorite one to the Cliff-House
and sea-lions       were thronged with coaches and buggies.
Meanwhile, the islands in the harbor and the surrounding
hills and country, so dead and barren but a few
weeks before, had now become superbly green, and the
whole bay and city lay embosomed in emerald.

We left there the middle of February for Arizona, and
did not get back until late in May. Then, when we returned
we found the rains long gone, the vegetation fast turning to
yellow       grain ripening in the fields       strawberries and
peas on the table       and the summer winds and fogs in
full vogue. At sunrise, it would be hot, even sultry, and
you would see persons dressed in white linen. By nine
or ten a. m., the wind would rise       a raw damp wind,
sometimes with fog, sweeping in from the Pacific       and[Pg 283]
in the evening, you would see ladies going to the Opera
with full winter furs on. How long this lasted, I cannot
say; but this was the weather we experienced, as a rule,
late in May and early in June. Heavy great-coats,
doubtless, are never necessary there. And so, on the
other hand, thin clothing is seldom wanted. Many indeed
said, they wore the same clothing all seasons of the
year, and seldom found it uncomfortable either way.
The truth seemed to be, that for hardy persons the
climate was excellent       the air bracing and stimulating       but
invalids were better off in the interior. Consumptives
could not stand the winds and fogs at all; and it was
a mooted question, as to whether the large percentage of
suicides just then, was not due in part to climatic influences.
The really healthy, however, appeared plump and
rosy, and the growing children promised well for the
future. Had 'Frisco been built at Benicia, or about there,
she would have escaped much of her climatic misery.
Even across the bay, at Oakland, they have a much
smoother climate. But she would "squat" on a sandspit,
at the mouth of the Golden Gate, where there is a
perpetual suck of wind and fog       from the ocean, into
the bay, and up the valley of the Sacramento       and now
must make the most of her situation.

Montgomery Street is the Broadway or Chestnut
Street of San Francisco, and California her Wall Street.
Her hotels, shops, and banking-houses are chiefly here,
and many of them are very handsome edifices. The
Occidental, Cosmopolitan, and Lick-House hotels, the new
Mercantile Library, and Bank of California, are stately
structures, that would do credit to any city. Their
height, four and five stories, seemed a little reckless, considering
the liability of the Coast to earthquakes; but the
people made light of this, notwithstanding some of their[Pg 284]
best buildings showed ominous cracks "from turret to
foundation stone." So long as they stood, everything
was believed secure; and commerce surged and roared
along the streets, as in New York and London. Brick,
well strengthened by iron, seemed to be the chief building
material in the business parts of the city, though
stone was coming into use, obtained from an excellent
quarry on Angel Island. The Bank of California had
been constructed of this, and was much admired by
everybody. The private residences, however, seemed
chiefly frame, and were seldom more than two and a half
stories high. Doubtless more heed is given to earthquakes
here, though your true Californian would be slow
to acknowledge this. Nevertheless, deep down in his
heart       at "bed-rock," as he would say       his household
gods are esteemed of more importance, than his commercial
commodities. In the suburbs, Mansard roofs
were fast coming into vogue, and everywhere there was a
general breaking out of Bay-Window. Brown seemed
to be the favorite color, doubtless to offset the summer
sand-storms, and the general prevalence of bay-windows
may also be due partly to these. Convenience and comfort       often
elegance and luxury       appeared everywhere,
and to an extent that was surprising, for a city so young
and raw. Shade-trees were still rare, because only the
native scrubby live-oaks, with deep penetrating roots,
can survive the long and dry summers there. But
shrubbery and flowers, prompted by plentiful irrigation,
appeared on every side, and the air was always redolent of
perfume. The most unpretending homes had their gems
of flower-gardens, with evergreens, fuchsias, geraniums,
pansies, and the variety and richness of their roses were
a perpetual delight. A rill of water, with trickling side
streams, made the barren sand-hills laugh with verdure[Pg 285]
and beauty, and gaunt wind-mills in every back-yard
kept up the supply. The wind-mill California rises
to the dignity of an institution, and is a godsend to
the whole coast. In winter, of course, they are not
needed. But throughout the long and rainless summer,
when vegetation withers up and blows away, the steady
sea-breeze keeps the wind-mills going, and these pump
up water for a thousand irrigating purposes. The vegetable
gardens about the city, and California farmers generally,
all patronize them, more or less, and thus grow
fruits and vegetables of exquisite character, and almost
every variety, the year round. The markets and fruit-stands
of San Francisco, groaning with apples, pears,
peaches, plums, pomegranates, oranges, grapes, strawberries,
etc., have already become world-renowned, and
the Pacific Railroad now places them at our very doors.

Montgomery street repeats Broadway in all but its
vista, but with something more perhaps of energy and
dash. The representative New Yorker always has a trace
of conservatism somewhere; but your true Californian
laughs at precedent, and is embodied go-ahead-ativeness.
In costume, he is careless, not to say reckless, insisting
on comfort at all hazards, and running greatly to pockets.
Stove-pipe hats are an abomination to him, and tight
trowsers nowhere; but beneath his slouch-hat are a keen
eye and nose, and his powers of locomotion are something
prodigious. Cleaner-cut, more wide-awake, and energetic
faces are nowhere to be seen. Few aged men appear, but
most average from twenty-five to forty years. Resolute,
alert, jaunty, bankrupt perhaps to-day, but to-morrow
picking their flints and trying it again, such men mean
business in all they undertake, and carry enterprise and
empire in the palms of their hands. The proportion of
ladies on Montgomery street, however, usually seemed[Pg 286]
small, and the quality inferior to that of the sterner sex.
Given to jewelry and loud colors, and still louder manners,
there was a fastness about them, that jarred upon
one's Eastern sense, though some noble specimens of
womanhood now and then appeared. Doubtless, the
hotel and apartment-life of so many San Franciscans had
something to do with this, as it is fatal to the more
modest and domestic virtues; but it must be doubted,
whether this will account for it entirely. Evidently,
California is still "short" of women, at least of the
worthier kind, and until she completes her supply will
continue to over-estimate and spoil what she has. At
least, this is the impression her Montgomery street dames
make upon a stranger, and unfortunately there is much
elsewhere to confirm it.

Respect for the Sabbath seemed to be a growing virtue,
but there was still room for much improvement. Many
of the stores and shops on Montgomery and Kearney
streets were open on Sunday, the same as other days;
and it seemed to be the favorite day for pic-nics and
excursions, to Oakland and San Mateo. Processions, with
bands of music, were not infrequent, and at Hayes' Park
in the Southern suburbs the whole Teuton element
seemed to concentrate on that day, for a general saturnalia.
On the other hand, there was a goodly array of well-filled
churches, and their pastors preached with much
fervency and power. The Jewish Synagogue is a magnificent
structure, one of the finest in America, and
deserves more than a passing notice. It is on Sutter
street, in a fine location overlooking the city, and cost
nearly half a million of dollars. The gilding and decoration
generally inside, viewed from the organ-loft, are
superb. But few of the large choir were Jews, and
scarcely any could read the old Hebrew songs and chants[Pg 287]
in the original; so these were printed in English, as
the Hebrew sounds, and thus they maintained the ancient
custom of singing and chanting only in Hebrew! Their
music, nevertheless, was grand and inspiring, and it
would be well, for our Gentile churches, to emulate it.
This was called the Progressive Synagogue. The congregation
had recently shortened the ancient service from
three hours to an hour and a half, by leaving out some of
the long prayers       "vain repetitions," it is presumed       and
the consequence was, a split in this most conservative
of churches. The good old conservative brethren,
of course, could not stand the abbreviation. They were
fully persuaded, they could never get to Paradise, with
only an hour and a half's service. So, they seceded, and
set up for themselves. Very prosperous and wealthy are
the Jews of San Francisco; and, indeed, all over the Pacific
Coast, our Hebrew friends enjoy a degree of respectability,
that few attain East. They number in their ranks
many of the leading bankers, merchants, lawyers, etc., of
San Francisco; and more than one of them sits upon the
Bench, gracing his seat. Poor Thomas Starr King's
church is a model in its way, and the congregation that
assembles there one of the most cultivated and refined
on the Pacific Coast. Their pastor, Dr. Stebbins, though
not equal to his great predecessor, in some respects, is a
man of marked thought and eloquence; and, by his broad
Christian charity, was doing a noble work in San Francisco.
So, Dr. Stone, formerly of Boston, was preaching
to large audiences, and declaring "the whole counsel of
God," without fear or favor. His church is plain but
large and commodious, and was always thronged with
attentive worshippers. Dr. Wadsworth, lately of Philadelphia,
was not attracting the attention he did East; but
his church was usually well-filled, and he was exerting[Pg 288]
an influence and power for good much needed. The
Methodists, our modern ecclesiastical sharp-shooters, did
not seem as live and aggressive, as they usually do elsewhere;
but we were told they were a great and growing
power on the Coast, for all that, and everybody bade
them God speed. The Episcopalians, as a rule, I regret
to say, appeared to make but little impression, and were
perhaps unfortunate in their chief official. The Catholics,
embracing most of the old Spanish population and much
of the foreign element, were vigorous and aggressive, and
made no concealment of the fact, that they were aiming
at supremacy. In this cosmopolitan city, the Chinese,
too, have their Temples, or Josh-Houses; but they were
much neglected, and John Chinaman, indeed, religiously
considered, seemed well on the road to philosophic
indifference.

During the past decade, however, things on the
whole had greatly improved, morally and religiously, as
the population had become more fixed and settled; and
all were hoping for a still greater improvement, with the
completion of the Railroad, and the resumption of old
family ties East. The drinking-saloons were being more
carefully regulated. The gambling-hells, no longer permitted
openly, were being more and more driven into
obscurity and secrecy. Law and order were more rigidly
enforced. The vigilance committees of former years still
exerted their beneficent example. The Alta, Bulletin,
and Times, then the three great papers of the city and
Coast, all noble journals, were all open and pronounced
in behalf of good morals and wholesome government; and
it is not too much to say, that the prospect for the future
was certainly very gratifying, not to say cheering.
"Forty-Niners," (Bret Harte's Argonauts) and other early
comers, declared themselves amazed, that they were getting[Pg 289]
on, as well as they did. "Yes," said one of the
best of them, a man of great shrewdness and ability, "I
grant, we Californians have been pretty rough customers,
and have not as many religious people among us yet, as
we ought to have; but then, what we have are iron-clad,
you bet!" I suspect that is about so. A man, who is
really religious in California, will likely be so anywhere.
The severity of his temptations, if he resist them, will
make him invulnerable; and all the "fiery darts of the
wicked one," elsewhere, will fall harmless at his feet.
Faithful Monitors are they, battling for Jesus; and in the
end, we know, will come off more than conquerors. With
all our hearts, let us bid them God speed!



[Pg 290]




CHAPTER XVIII.

SAN FRANCISCO (continued).


Here in San Francisco, our National greenbacks
were no longer a legal tender, but everything was
on a coin basis. Just as in New York, you sell gold and
buy greenbacks, if you want a convenient medium of
exchange, so here we had to sell greenbacks and buy gold.
A dime was the smallest coin, and "two bits" (twenty-five
cents) the usual gratuity. A newspaper cost a dime,
or two for twenty-five cents       the change never being
returned. Fruits and vegetables were cheap, but dry-goods,
groceries, clothing, books, etc., about the same in
gold, as East in greenbacks. The general cost of living,
therefore, seemed to be about the same as in New York,
plus the premium on gold. California and the Pacific
slope generally had refused to adopt the National
currency, and it was still a mooted question whether they
had lost or gained by this. At first, they thought it a
great gain to be rid of our paper dollars; but public
opinion had changed greatly, and many were getting to
think they had made a huge mistake, in not originally
acquiescing in the national necessity. The prosperity of
the East during the war, and the pending sluggishness
of trade on the Coast (still continuing), were much commented
on, as connected with this question of Coin vs.
Greenbacks; but it was thought too late to remedy the
matter now. This hostility to our Greenbacks did not[Pg 291]
seem to arise from a want of patriotism, so much as from
a difference of opinion, as to the necessity or propriety
of their using a paper currency, when they had all the
gold and silver they wanted, and were exporting a surplus
by every steamer. If there was a speck of Secession
there at first, California afterwards behaved very nobly,
especially when she came with her bullion by the many
thousands to the rescue of the Sanitary Commission; and
Starr King's memory was still treasured everywhere, as
that of a martyr for the Union. The oncoming Pacific
Railroad was constantly spoken of, as a new "bond of
union," to link the Coast to the Atlantic States as with
"hooks of steel;" and, evidently, nothing (unless it may
be the Chinese Question) can disturb the repose of the
Republic there, for long years to come. The people
almost universally spoke lovingly and tenderly of the
East, as their old "home," and thousands were awaiting
the completion of the Railroad to go thither once again.

Their great passion, however, just then, was for
territorial aggrandizement. Mr. Seward had just announced
his purchase of Alaska, and of course, everybody
was delighted, as they would have been if he had
bought the North Pole, or even the tip end of it. Next
they wanted British Columbia and the Sandwich Islands,
and hoped before long also to possess Mexico and down
to the Isthmus. The Sitka Ice Company, which for
some years had supplied San Francisco and the Coast
with their only good ice, was proof positive, that there
was cold weather sometimes in Alaska; nevertheless,
they claimed, the Sage of Auburn had certainly shown
himself to be a great statesman, by going into this Real
Estate business, however hyperborean the climate. It
was soon alleged to be a region of fair fields and dimpled
meadows, of luscious fruits and smiling flowers, of[Pg 292]
magnificent forests and inexhaustible mines, as well as
of icebergs and walrusses; and straightway a steamer
cleared for Sitka, with a full complement of passengers,
expecting to locate a "city" there and sell "corner lots,"
start a Mining Company and "water" stock, or initiate
some other California enterprise.

Christmas and New Year in San Francisco were
observed very generally, and with even more spirit than
in the East. The shops and stores had been groaning
with gifts and good things for some time, and on Christmas
Eve the whole city seems to pour itself into Montgomery
street. Early in the evening, there was a scattering
tooting of trumpets, chiefly by boys; but along toward
midnight, a great procession of men and boys drifted together,
and traversing Montgomery, Kearney, and adjacent
streets, made the night hideous with every kind of
horn, from a dime trumpet to a trombone. New Year
was ushered in much the same way, though not quite so
elaborately. On both of these winter holidays there happened
to be superb weather, much like what we have East
in May, with the sky clear, and the air crisp, and the whole
city       with his wife and child       seemed to be abroad. The
good old Knickerbocker custom of New Year calls was
apparently everywhere accepted, and thoroughly enjoyed.
Every kind of vehicle was in demand, and "stag" parties
of four or five gentlemen       out calling on their lady
friends       were constantly met, walking hilariously along,
or driving like mad. Quite a number of army officers
happened to be in San Francisco just then, and their
uniforms of blue and brass made many a parlor gay.
Of names known east, there were Generals Halleck,
McDowell, Allen, Steele, Irvin Gregg, French, King,
Fry, etc., and these with their brother officers were
everywhere heartily welcomed. Indeed, army officers[Pg 293]
are nowhere more esteemed or better treated, than on
the Pacific Coast, and all are usually delighted with their
tour of duty there. In former years, many of them married
magnificent ranches       encumbered, however, with
native señoritas       and here and there we afterwards
met them, living like grand seignors on their broad and
baronial acres. Ranches leagues in extent, and maintaining
thousands of cattle and sheep, are still common in
California, and some of the best of these belong to ex-army
officers. Their owners, however, do but little in the way
of pure farming, and are always ready to give a quarter
section or so to any stray emigrant, who will settle down
and cultivate it       especially to old comrades.

The great feature of San Francisco, of course, is her
peerless bay. Yet noble as it is for purposes of commerce,
it avails little for pleasure excursions; and 'Frisco, indeed,
might be better off in this respect. A trip to Oakland
is sometimes quite enjoyable, and the ride by railroad
down the peninsula, skirting the bay, to San Josè, is
always a delight. But the bay itself is fickle and morose
in winter, and in summer must be raw and gusty. The
suck of wind, from the Pacific into the interior, through
the Golden Gate, as through a funnel, always keeps the
bay more or less in a turmoil; and during the time we
were there, it seemed quite neglected, except for business
purposes. One day, in the middle of January,
however, we had duties that took us to Alcatraz and
Angel Island, and essayed the trip thither in a little
sloop. On leaving the Occidental, the sky was overcast,
and we had the usual drizzle of that winter; but
before we reached Meigg's Wharf, it had thickened
into a pouring rain, and as we crossed to Alcatraz squalls
were churning the outer bay into foam in all directions.
After an hour or two there, on that rocky fortress, the[Pg 294]
key of San Francisco, with the wind and rain dashing
fitfully about us, we took advantage of a temporary lull
to re-embark for Angel Island. We had hardly got off,
however, before squall after squall came charging down
upon us; and as we beat up the little strait between
Angel Island and Socelito, the sloop careening and the
waves breaking over us, it seemed at times as if we were
in a fair way of going to the bottom. Just as we rounded
the rocky point of the Island, before reaching the landing,
a squall of unusual force struck us athwart the bows,
wave after wave leaped aboard, and for awhile our gallant
little craft quivered in the blast like a spent race-horse, as
she struggled onward. An abrupt lee shore was on one
side, the squall howling on the other; but we faced it out,
and in a lull, that soon followed, shot by the landing (it
being too rough to halt there), and weathering the next
point dropped anchor in a little cove behind it, just in
time to escape another squall even fiercer than the
former. Had we been off either point, or out in the
bay, when this last one struck us, no doubt we would
have gone ashore or to Davy Jones' locker; and altogether,
as our Captain said, it was a "nasty, dirty day," even for
San Francisco. Returning, we had skies less treacherous
and a smoother run; but were glad to reach the grateful
welcome and spacious halls of the Occidental, best of
hotels, again. It may be, that the bay was a little ruder
that day, than usual; but it bears a bad name for sudden
gusts and squalls, and San Franciscans give it a wide
berth generally. Sometimes, in summer, it is afflicted by
calms as well as squalls; we heard some amusing stories
of parties becalmed there until late at night, unable to
reach either shore; so that, altogether, however useful
otherwise, it can hardly be regarded as adding much per
se to the pleasures of a life in 'Frisco.

[Pg 295]

As an offset to this, however, all orthodox San Franciscans,
swear by the Cliff-House and the sea-lions. To
"go to the Cliff," is the right thing to do in San Francisco,
and not to go to the Cliff-House is not to see or
know California. In the summer, people drive there in
the early morning, to breakfast and return before the
sea-breeze rises, and then hundreds of gay equipages
throng the well-kept road. Even in winter, at the right
hour, you are always sure to meet many driving out or
in. Of course, we went to the "Cliff"       wouldn't have
missed going there for anything. Past Lone Mountain
Cemetery, that picturesque city of the dead, the fine
graveled road strikes straight through the sand-hills, for
five or six miles, to the Pacific; and when you reach the
overhanging bluff, on which the hotel perches like an
eagle's nest, you have a grand view of the Golden Gate
and the far-stretching sea beyond. On the very verge
of the horizon hang the Farallones, pointing the way to
Japan and China, and the white sails of vessels beating
in or out the harbor dot the ocean far and near. Just in
front of the hotel are several groups of high shelving
rocks, among which the ocean moans and dashes ceaselessly,
and here the seals or "sea-lions," as 'Frisco lovingly
calls them, have a favorite rendezvous and home.
The day we were there, there appeared to be a hundred
or more of them, large and small, swimming about the
rocks or clambering over them, while pelicans and gulls
kept them company. Some were small, not larger than
a half-grown sturgeon, while others again were huge
unwieldy monsters, not unlike legless oxen, weighing
perhaps a thousand pounds or more. "Ben Butler" was
an immense, overgrown creature, as selfish and saucy,
apparently, as he could well be; and another, called "Gen.
Grant," was not much better. They kicked and cuffed[Pg 296]
the rest overboard quite indiscriminately, though now
and then they were compelled to take a plunge themselves.
Many contented themselves with merely gamboling
around the water's edge; but others had somehow
managed slimily to roll and climb forty or fifty feet up
the rocks, and there lay sunning themselves in supreme
felicity, like veteran politicians snug in office. Sometimes
two or three would get to wrangling about the
same position, as if one part of the rocks were softer
than another, and then they would bark and howl at
each other, and presently essay to fight in the most
clumsy and ludicrous way. "Ben Butler," or "Gen.
Grant," would usually settle the squabble, by a harsh
bark, or by flopping the malcontents overboard, and then
would resume his nap with becoming satisfaction. Uncouth,
and yet half-human in their way, with a cry that
sometimes startled you like a distant wail, we watched
their movements from the piazza of the hotel with much
interest, and must congratulate 'Frisco on having such a
first-class "sensation." May her "sea-lions" long remain
to her as a "lion" of the first water, and their numbers
and renown never grow less! In former years, they
were much shot at and annoyed, by thoughtless visitors.
But subsequently the State took them under her protection,
and now it was a penal offence to injure or
disturb them. This is right, and California should be
complimented, for thus trying to preserve and perpetuate
this interesting colony of her original settlers.

Returning, we had a superb drive down the beach,
with the surf thundering at our wheels; and thence, by
a winding road over and through the hills, reached the
city again. It was a glorious day in February, after a
fortnight of perpetual drizzle       a June day for beauty, but
toned by an October breeze       the sun flashing overhead like[Pg 297]
a shield of gold; the road, over and between the hills,
gave us from time to time exquisite glimpses of the sea
or bay and city; every sense seemed keyed to a new life
and power of enjoyment; and the memory of that "drive
to the Cliff," is something wonderfully clear and charming
still. It would be surprising, if Californians did not
brag considerably about it. They are not famed for
modesty, and would be heathens, if they kept silence.

Californians are proverbial for their ups and downs,
and we heard much of their varying fortunes. You will
scarcely meet a leading citizen, who has not been down
to "hard-pan" once or twice in his career, and everybody
seems to enjoy telling about it. In former years, many
had been rich in "feet" or "corner-lots," who yet had
not enough "dust" to buy a "square-meal;" and men
with Great Expectations, but small cash in hand, were
still not infrequent. I ran foul of an old school-mate
one day, who arrived in California originally as captain
of an ox-team, which he had driven across the Plains.
But now he was deep in mining-stocks, and twenty-vara
lots, and was rated as a millionaire. I met another who
for years lost all he invested in "feet." But luckily, at
last, he went into Savage and Yellow Jacket, and now
he owned handsome blocks on Montgomery and California
streets, and lived like a prince at the Occidental.
Another still, named O., an eccentric genius, came
out to California early, and his uncle (already there)
secured him a place in a dry-goods house. In a few
months, the house failed, and O. fell back on his uncle's
hands again. Then he was given a place in a silk-house,
but in a short time this also failed. A fatality
seemed to accompany the poor fellow. Wherever he
went, the houses either failed, closed up, or burned out;
and thus, time after time, he came back to his uncle, like[Pg 298]
a bad penny. Once he was reduced so low, he went to
driving a dray, glad to get even that; and again, turned
chiffonier, and eked out a precarious living by collecting
the old bones, scraps of tin, sheet-iron, etc., that lay scattered
about the suburbs. Finally, he wisely concluded
he had "touched bottom," and that California was no
place for him. So, his kind-hearted uncle bought him
a ticket home by the "Golden City," and supposed when
he bade him good-bye on her gang-way, that that would
be the last he would see of O. in California. But a
week or so afterwards, early one Sunday morning, he was
roused up by some one rapping lustily at the door, and
opening it lo! there was his hopeful nephew again       "large
as life and twice as natural!" It seems, the ill-fated
steamer, when two or three hundred miles down
the Coast, had caught fire and been beached, with the
loss of many lives; but O., strange to say, had escaped
scot-free, and now was on hand again. He now tried
two or three more situations, thinking his "luck" perhaps
had turned, but failed in all of them or they soon
failed; and finally set out for the East again, but this
time across the Plains, driving a "bull-team." He got
safely back to New York, and taking hold of his father's
business       grain and flour       for a wonder, made it prosper.
He pushed ahead with this swimmingly for awhile,
until he had made fifty thousand dollars or so, when he
concluded to go into a flour speculation on his own account.
He did so, buying largely, when suddenly the bottom
dropped out of the market, leaving O. penniless again,
with a large deficit       he meanwhile, disappearing. Some
years afterwards he turned up in Minnesota, where he
had married a border maiden, and gone to farming, and
at the last accounts was doing tolerably well again.

Californians will spin you such "yarns" by the evening       half[Pg 299]
humorous, half pathetic       and it is upon such
romantic histories, that the Golden State has advanced to
empire.

But the day of her adventurers is passing away, and
society there is fast settling down to its normal conditions.
Fewer and still fewer of her people return East, to spend
their hard-earned fortunes; and the generation now growing
up there regard the Coast as their natural home, and
love it dearly. Proud of the soil and enamored of the
climate, they expect great things of the future, and surely
all the world should wish them well. There are no
better or braver men, than our citizens there generally,
and the Pacific slope is safe in their hands and brains,
beyond peradventure. "Who helps himself, God helps,"
is a wise old French maxim; and California believes in
it, fully and thoroughly, from the Sierras to the sea.

CHAPTER XIX.

SAN FRANCISCO (Concluded).


The Chinese Question, we had an opportunity of
looking into considerably, first and last, and here are
some conclusions. Striking the orientals at Boisè City,
in Idaho, we had followed them down the Columbia and
the Coast to San Francisco, and here endeavored to learn
all we could about them. We found them everywhere
on the streets and in the houses, in pretty much all occupations
except the very highest, and were constantly
amazed at their general thrift and intelligence. Out of
the hundred thousand or so on the Coast, perhaps half
were massed in San Francisco and its suburbs; so here
was the place to see and study John Chinaman in
America, if anywhere. All wore the collarless Chinese
blouse, looped across the breast, not buttoned       that of
the poorer classes of coarse blue stuff, but of the richer of
broadcloth. Otherwise, they dressed outwardly chiefly
as Americans. Here and there a Chinese hat, such as
you see in the tea-prints, appeared, but not often       the
American felt-hat being the rule, stove-pipes never. A
Chinaman with a stove-pipe hat on would truly be an
anomaly, a violation of all the unities and proprieties at
once. A good many still wore the Chinese shoe,
wooden-soled, with cotton uppers; but the American
boot and shoe were fast supplanting this, especially
among the out-door classes, such as mechanics and laborers.[Pg 301]
Pig-tails were universal, generally hanging down, but
often coiled around the head, under the hat, so as to be
out of the way and attract less attention. In features,
of course, they were all true Mongolians; but here and
there were grand faces, worthy of humanity anywhere.
Their food consists chiefly of fish and rice; but the
wealthier classes indulge freely in poultry and beef, and
the Chinese taste for these was constantly on the increase.
The old stories of their dog and rat diet are evidently
myths, at least here in America, and no doubt are equally
so in China, except in very rare instances, among the
poorest classes, and even then only under the direst necessity.
Intelligent Californians laugh at such reports as
antediluvian, and say their Chinese neighbors are only too
glad to eat the very best, if they can only get it. Everybody
gave them credit for sobriety, intelligence, and thrift,
the three great master qualities of mankind, practically
speaking; and without them the industry of the Pacific
Coast, it was conceded, would soon come to a stand-still.
All are expert at figures, all read and write their own
tongue, and nearly all seemed intent on mastering English,
as quickly and thoroughly as possible. When not at
work or otherwise occupied, they were usually seen with
a book in their hands, and seemed much given to reading
and study. Their chief vices were gambling, and opium-smoking;
but these did not seem to prevail to the extent
we had heard, and appeared really less injurious, than
the current vices of other races on the Coast, all things
considered. The statistics of the city and Coast somehow
were remarkably in their favor, showing a less percentage
of vagrancy and crime among these heathens, than
any other part of the population, notwithstanding the
absurd prejudices and barbarous discriminations against
them. Their quickness to learn all American ways, even[Pg 302]
when not able to speak our tongue, was very surprising.
They engaged in all household duties, ran errands, worked
at trades, performed all kinds of manual labor, and yet
as a rule, their only dialect was a sort of chow-chow or
"Pigeon English," of which the following is a good specimen.
It is Longfellow's "Excelsior" done into Pigeon-English,
and speaks for itself.


"TOPSIDE GALAH.


"That nightee teem he come chop chop,
One young man walkee, no can stop;
Colo maskee, icee maskee;
He got flag; chop b'long welly culio, see       
Topside Galah!

"He too muchee solly; one piecee eye,
Lookee sharp       so fashion       alla same mi;
He talkee largee, talkee stlong,
Too muchee culio; alla same gong       
Topside Galah!

"Inside any housee he can see light,
Any piecee loom got fire all light;
He look see plenty ice more high,
Inside he mouf he plenty cly       
Topside Galah!

"'No can walkee!' olo man speakee he;
'Bimeby lain come, no can see;
Hab got water, welly wide!
Maskee, mi must go topside       
Topside Galah!

"'Man-man,' one galo talkee he;
'What for you go topside look-see?'
'Nother teem,' he makee plenty cly;
Maskee, alla teem walkee plenty high       
Topside Galah![Pg 303]

"'Take care that spilum tlee, young man;
Take care that icee!' he no man-man;
That coolie chin-chin he good night;
He talkee, 'mi can go all light'       
Topside Galah!

"Joss pidgin man chop chop begin,
Morning teem that Joss chin-chin,
No see any man, he plenty fear,
Cause some man talkee, he can hear       
Topside Galah!

"Young man makee die: one largee dog see,
Too muchee bobbery, findee he;
Hand too muchee colo, inside can stop;
Alla same piecee flag, got culio chop       
Topside Galah!"


"Pigeon" is said to be the nearest approach a Chinaman
can make to "business," and hence "Pigeon
English" really means business English. Most of the
above words are English, more or less distorted; a few,
however, are Chinese Anglicised. They always use l
for r       thus lice for "rice;" mi for "I," etc.; and abound
in terminal "ee's." Chop-chop means "very fast;"
maskee, "don't mind;" Topside Galah, "Excelsior,
hurrah!" If you call on a lady, and inquire of her Chinese
servant, "Missee have got?" He will reply, if she
be up and about, "Missee hab got topside;" or, if she
be still asleep, "Missee hab got, wakee sleepee." Not
wishing to disturb her, you hand him your card, and go
away with, "Maskee, maskee; no makee bobbery!"

We had seen a good deal of the Chinese generally,
but on the evening of Dec. 31st were so fortunate as to
meet most of their leading men together. The occasion
was a grand banquet at the Occidental, given by the merchants
of San Francisco, in honor of the sailing of the[Pg 304]
Colorado, the first steamer of the new monthly line to
Hong-Kong. All the chief men of the city       merchants,
lawyers, clergymen, politicians       were present, and among
the rest some twenty or more Chinese merchants and
bankers. The Governor of the State presided, and the
military and civil dignitaries most eminent on the Coast
were all there. The magnificent Dining-Room of the
Occidental was handsomely decorated with festoons and
flowers, and tastefully draped with the flags of all nations       chief
among which, of course, were our own Stars and
Stripes, and the Yellow-Dragon of the Flowery Empire.
A peculiar feature was an infinity of bird-cages all about
the room, from which hundreds of canaries and mockingbirds
discoursed exquisite music the livelong evening.
The creature comforts disposed of, there were eloquent
addresses by everybody, and among the rest one by Mr.
Fung Tang, a young Chinese merchant, who made one of
the briefest and most sensible of them all. It was in fair
English, and vastly better than the average of post-prandial
discourses. This was the only set speech by a Chinaman,
but the rest conversed freely in tolerable English,
and in deportment were certainly perfect Chesterfields of
courtesy and propriety. They were mostly large, dignified,
fine-looking men, and two of them       Mr. Hop Kee, a
leading tea-merchant, and Mr. Chy Lung, a noted silk-factor       had
superb heads and faces, that would have
attracted attention anywhere. They sat by themselves;
but several San Franciscans of note shared their table,
and everybody hob-nobbed with them, more or less,
throughout the evening. These were the representatives
of the great Chinese Emigration and Banking Companies,
whose checks pass current on 'Change in San Francisco,
for a hundred thousand dollars or more any day,
and whose commercial integrity so far was unstained.[Pg 305]
There are five of these Companies in all, the Yung-Wo,
the Sze-Yap, the Sam-Yap, the Yan-Wo, and the Ning-Yung.
They contract with their countrymen in China
to transport them to America, insure them constant
work while here at fixed wages, and at the expiration of
their contract return them to China again, dead or alive,
if so desired. They each have a large and comfortable
building in San Francisco, where they board and lodge
their members, when they first arrive, or when sick, or
out of work, or on a visit from the interior. Chinese beggars
are rare on the Coast, and our public hospitals contain
no Chinese patients, although John before landing
has always to pay a "hospital-tax" of ten dollars. This is
what it is called out there; but, of course, it is a robbery
and swindle, which the Golden State ought promptly to
repeal. These great Companies also act, as express-agents
and bankers, all over the Coast. In all the chief
towns and mining districts, wherever you enter a Chinese
quarter or camp, you will find a representative of
one or more of them, who will procure anything a Chinaman
needs, from home or elsewhere; and faithfully
remit to the Flowery Kingdom whatever he wants to
send, even his own dead body. Both parties appear to
keep their contracts well       a breach of faith being
seldom recorded. Here, surely, is evidence of fine talent
for organization and management       the best tests of
human intellect and capacity       and a hint at the existence
of sterling qualities, which the English-speaking nations
are slow to credit other races with. Such gigantic
schemes, such far-reaching plans, such harmonious workings,
and exact results, imply a genius for affairs, that
not even the Anglo-Saxon can afford to despise, and
which all others may ponder with profit. A race that
can plan and execute such things as these, must have[Pg 306]
some vigor and virility in it, whatever its other peculiarities.

Some days after the Banquet, we were driven out to
the Mission Woolen Mills, where Donald McLennan, a
Massachusetts Scotch-Yankee, was converting California
wool into gold. The climate being so favorable to sheep,
the wool-product of the coast was already large, and
everywhere rapidly increasing. In 1867, California alone
yielded ten million pounds, and the rest of the coast
fully two millions more. Of this amount, about one-half
was consumed on the Pacific Coast, and the balance
exported to New York and Liverpool. The average
price per pound in San Francisco was about seventeen
cents, coin; but this was lower, than it had usually been.[16]
There were several other Woolen Mills on the Coast;
but the Mission-Mills were the largest, and had a great
reputation for honest work. They were then doing a
business of about a million dollars per year, coin, in
cloths, cassimeres, blankets, flannels, shawls, etc., and the
demand for their goods was constantly on the increase.
Their work, on the whole, was of a superior character,
and Californians were justly very proud of it. They
were supplying all the Army blankets in use on the Coast,
and what a contrast they were to the "shoddy" webs,
issued to our Boys in Blue east during the war! The
troops transferred from the east now threw their old Army
blankets away, on arriving in San Francisco, and gladly
furnished themselves with these Mission blankets, at
their own expense, before leaving for the wilds of Washington
and Arizona. Some extra specimens, intended
for the Paris Exposition, as white as new-fallen snow
and soft as satin, had the American and French coats of[Pg 307]
arms embroidered very handsomely on them. Another
pair, meant for General Grant, were lustrous with the
Stars and Stripes, and traditional eagle, and now no
doubt help to furnish the White House. A pair sent to
Gen. M. in the east, a noted connoisseur in blankets, he
declared the finest he ever saw, and added, "My daughter
would make one of them into an opera-cloak, they
are so elegant, if she hadn't one already." I mention all
these things thus particularly, in order to emphasize the
fact, that out of the 450 persons then employed about
these Mills, 350 were Chinamen. For the heavier
work, Americans or Europeans were preferred; but the
more delicate processes, we were assured, Chinamen
learned more quickly and performed more deftly, besides
never becoming drunk, or disorderly, or going on a
"strike." We saw them at the looms, engaged in the
most painstaking and superb pieces of workmanship, and
they could not have been more attentive and exact, if
they had been a part of the machinery itself. And yet,
these one hundred Anglo-Saxons were paid $2,95 per
day, coin, while the three hundred and fifty Chinamen
received only $1,10 per day, coin, though the average
work of each was about the same. Without this cheap
labor of John Chinaman, these Mills would have had to
close up; with it, they were run at a profit, and at the
same time were a great blessing and credit to the Pacific
Coast in every way. So, also, the Central Pacific Railroad
was then being pushed through and over the Sierra
Nevadas, by some ten thousand Chinamen, working for
one dollar per day each, in coin, and finding themselves,
when no other labor could be had for less than two dollars
and a half per day, coin. It was simply a question
with the Central directors, whether to build the
road or not. Without John, it was useless to attempt[Pg 308]
it, as the expense would have bankrupted the company,
even if other labor could have been had, which was problematical.
With him, the road is already a fact accomplished;
and in view of possible contingencies, nationally
and politically, who shall say we have completed it an
hour too soon? Here are practical results, not shadowy
theories       of such a character, too, as should give one
pause, however anti-Chinese, and ought to outweigh a
world of prejudices.

Not long afterwards, we were invited to join a party
of gentlemen, and make a tour of the Chinese quarter.
Part were from the East, like ourselves, bent on information,
and the rest Pacific-Coasters. We started early in
the evening, escorted by two policemen, who were
familiar with the ins and outs of Chinadom, and did not
reach the Occidental again until long after midnight.
We went first to the Chinese Theatre, an old hotel on
the corner of Jackson and Dupont streets, that had
recently been metamorphosed into an Oriental play-house.
We found two or three hundred Chinese here,
of both sexes, but mainly males, listening to a play, that
required eighty weeks or months       our informants were
not certain which       to complete its performance. Here
was drama for you, surely, and devotion to it! It was a
history of the Flowery Kingdom, by some Chinese
Shakespeare       half-tragedy, half-comedy, like most human
history       and altogether was a curious medley. The
actors appeared to be of both sexes, but we were told
were only men and boys. Their dresses were usually
very rich, the finest of embroidered silks, and their acting
quite surprised us. Their pantomime was excellent,
their humor irresistible, and their love-passages a good
reproduction of the grand passion, that in all ages "makes
the world go round." But it is to be doubted, if the[Pg 309]
Anglo-Saxon ear will ever become quite reconciled to
John's orchestra. This consisted of a rough drum, a
rude banjo or guitar, and a sort of violin, over whose
triple clamors a barbarous clarionet squeaked and squealed
continually. Japanese music, as rendered by Risley's
troupe of "Jugglers," is much similar to it; only John's
orchestra is louder, and more hideous. Much of the
play was pantomime, and other much opera; some, however,
was common dialogue, and when this occurred,
the clash and clang of the Chinese consonants was something
fearful. Every word seemed to end in "ng," as
Chang, Ling, Hong, Wung; and when the parts became
animated, their voices roared and rumbled about the
stage, like Chinese gongs in miniature. The general
behavior of the audience was good; everybody, however,
smoked       the majority cigars and cigarritos, a very few
opium. Over the theatre was a Chinese lottery-office,
on entering which the proprietor tendered you wine
and cigars, like a genuine Californian. He himself was
whiffing away at a cigarrito, and was as polite and politic,
as a noted New York ex-M. C., in the same lucrative
business. Several Chinamen dropped in to buy tickets,
while we were there; and the business seemed to be
conducted on the same principle, or rather want of
principle, as among Anglo-Saxons elsewhere.

Next we explored the famous Barbary Coast, and
witnessed scenes that Charles Dickens never dreamed of,
with all his studies of the dens and slums of London and
Paris. Here in narrow, noisome alleys are congregated
the wretched Chinese women, that are imported by the
ship-load, mainly for infamous purposes. As a class, they
are small in stature, scarcely larger than an American
girl of fourteen, and usually quite plain. Some venture
on hoops and crinoline, but the greater part retain the[Pg 310]
Chinese wadded gown and trousers. Their chignons are
purely Chinese       huge, unique, indescribable       and would
excite the envy even of a Broadway belle. They may
be seen on the street any day in San Francisco, bonnetless,
fan in hand, hobbling along in their queer little
shoes, perfect fac-similes of the figures you see on
lacquered ware imported from the Orient. They are not
more immodest, than those of our own race, who ply the
same vocation in Philadelphia and New York; and their
fellow-countrymen, it seemed, behaved decently well even
here. But here is the great resort of sailors, miners,
'long-shoremen, and the floating population generally of
San Francisco, and the brutality and bestiality of the
Saxon and the Celt here all comes suddenly to the surface,
as if we were fiends incarnate. Here are the St. Giles
of London and the Five Points of New York, magnified
and intensified (if possible), both crowded into one, and
what a hideous example it is for Christendom to set to
Heathendom! San Francisco owes it to herself, and to
our boasted civilization, to cleanse this Augean stable       to
obliterate, to stamp out this plague-spot       to purge it,
if need be, by fire       and she has not a day to lose in doing
it. It is the shameful spectacle, shocking alike to gods
and men, of a strong race trampling a weaker one
remorselessly in the mud; and justice will not sleep
forever, confronted by such enormities.

The same evening we took a turn through the Chinese
gambling-houses, but did not find them worse than
similar institutions elsewhere. Indeed, they were rather
more quiet and respectable, than the average of such
"hells" in San Francisco. They were frequented solely
by Chinamen, and though John is not averse to "fighting
the tiger," he proposes to do it in his own dolce far
niente way. They seemed to have only one game, which[Pg 311]
consisted in betting whether in diminishing steadily a
given pile of perforated brass-coins, an odd or even number
of them would at last be left. The banker with a
little rod, drew the coins, two at a time, rapidly out of
the pile towards himself, and when the game was ended
all parties cheerfully paid up their losses or pocketed their
gains. The stakes were small, seldom more than twenty-five
or fifty cents each, and disputes infrequent. A rude
idol or image of Josh, with a lamp constantly burning
before it, appeared in all these dens, and indeed was universal
throughout the Chinese quarter.

The Chinese New Year comes in February, and is an
occasion of rare festivities. It began at midnight on the
4th that year, and was ushered in with a lavish discharge
of fire-crackers and rockets, to which our usual Fourth of
July bears about the same comparison as a minnow to a
whale. The fusilade of crackers continued, more or less,
for a day or two, until the whole Chinese quarter was littered
with their remains. It takes them three days to
celebrate this holiday, and during all this period there
was a general suspension of business, and every Chinaman
kept open house. Their leading merchants welcomed
all "Melican" men who called upon them, and the Celestials
themselves were constantly passing from house to
house, exchanging the compliments of the season. I
dropped in upon several, whom I had met at the Banquet,
and now have lying before me the unique cards of Mr.
Hop Kee, Mr. Chy Lung, Mr. Fung Tang, Messrs. Tung
Fu and Co., Messrs. Kwoy Hing and Co., Messrs. Sun
Chung Kee and Co., etc. Several of these understood and
spoke English very well, and all bore themselves becomingly,
like well-to-do gentlemen. Like the majority of
their countrymen, many were small; but some were full-sized,
athletic men, scarcely inferior, if at all, to our average[Pg 312]
American. Their residences were usually back of
their stores, and here we everywhere found refreshments
set out, and all invited to partake, with a truly Knickerbocker
hospitality. Tea, sherry, champagne, cakes,
sweetmeats, cigars, all were offered without stint, but
never pressed unduly. For three days the whole Chinese
quarter was thus given up to wholesale rejoicing,
and hundreds of Americans flocked thither, to witness the
festivity and fun. John everywhere appeared in his best
bib and tucker, if not with a smile on his face, yet with a
look of satisfaction and content; for this was the end of
his debts, as well as the beginning of a new year. At
this period, by Chinese custom or law, a general settlement
takes place among them, a balance is struck between
debtor and creditor, and everybody starts afresh. If unable
to pay up, the debtor surrenders his assets for the
equal benefit of his creditors, his debts are sponged out,
and then with a new ledger and a clean conscience he
"picks his flint and tries it again." This is the merciful,
if not sensible, Bankrupt Law of the Chinese, in force
among these heathen for thousands of years       "for a
time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the
contrary"       and its humane and wise provisions suggest,
whether our Christian legislators, after all, may not have
something to learn, even from Pagan codes.

The Chinese temple, synagogue, or "Josh-House,"
of which we had heard such conflicting reports, stands
near the corner of Kearney and Pine streets, in the
heart of the city. It is a simple structure of brick, two
or three stories high, and would attract little or no
attention, were it not for a plain marble slab over the
entrance, with "Sze-Yap Asylum" carved upon it, in
gilt letters, and the same repeated in Chinese characters.
It was spoken of as a "Heathen Synagogue," a "Pagan[Pg 313]
Temple," etc., and we had heard much ado about it, from
people of the William Nye school chiefly, long before
reaching San Francisco. But, in reality, it appeared to
be only an asylum or hospital, for the unemployed and infirm
of the Sze-Yap Emigration Company; with a small
"upper chamber," set apart for such religious services, as
to them seemed meet. The other companies all have similar
hospitals or asylums, but we visited only this one. The
first room on the ground-floor seemed to be the business-room
or council-chamber of the company, and this was
adorned very richly with crimson and gold. Silk-hangings
were on the walls, arm-chairs elaborately carved
along the sides, and at the end on a raised platform stood
a table and chair, as if ready for business. The room
adjoining seemed to be the general smoking and lounging
room of the members of the company. Here several
Chinamen lay stretched out, on rude but comfortable
lounges, two smoking opium, all the rest only cigarritos       taking
their afternoon siesta. Back of this were the
dining-room, kitchen, etc., but we did not penetrate
thither. A winding stairs brought us to the second floor,
and here was the place reserved for religious purposes,       an
"upper chamber" perhaps twenty by thirty feet, or
even less. Its walls and ceiling were hung with silk, and
here and there were placards, inscribed with moral
maxims from Confucius and other writers, much as we
suspend the same on the walls of our Sunday-school
rooms, with verses on them from our Sacred writings.
These mottoes, of course, were in Chinese; but they
were said to exhort John to virtue, fidelity, integrity, the
veneration of ancestors, and especially to admonish the
young men not to forget, that they are away from home,
and to do nothing to prejudice the character of their country
in the eyes of foreigners. A few gilded spears and[Pg 314]
battle-axes adorned either side, while overhead hung
clusters of Chinese lanterns, unique and beautiful.
Flowers were scattered about quite profusely, both
natural and artificial       the latter perfect in their way.
At the farther end of the room, in "a dim religious light,"
amid a barbaric array of bannerets and battle-axes, stood
their sacred Josh       simply a Representative Chinaman,
perhaps half life-size, with patient pensive eyes, long
drooping moustaches, and an expression doubtless meant
for sublime repose or philosophic indifference. Here all
orthodox Chinamen in San Francisco, connected with
the Sze-Yap company, were expected to come at least
once a year, and propitiate the deity by burning a slip
of paper before his image. There was also some praying
to be done, but this was accomplished by putting printed
prayers in a machine run by clock-work. Tithes there
were none       at least worth mentioning. Altogether, this
seemed to be a very easy and cheap religion; and yet,
easy as it was, John did not seem to trouble himself
much about it. The place looked much neglected, as if
worshippers were scarce, and devotees infrequent. A
priest or acolyte, who came in and trimmed the ever-burning
lamp, without even a bow or genuflection to
Josh, was the only person about the "Temple," while
we were there. The dormitories and apartments for the
sick and infirm, we were told, were on this same floor
and above; but we did not visit them. This Josh-worship,
such as it is, seemed to be general among the
Chinese, except the handful gathered into the various
Christian churches; but it did not appear to be more
than a ceremony. The truth is, John is a very practical
creature, and was already beginning to understand, that
he is in a new land and among new ideas. Surely, our
vigorous, aggressive California Christians stand in no[Pg 315]
danger from such Pagan "Temples," and our all-embracing
nationality can well afford to tolerate them,
as China in turn tolerates ours. The hospital and
asylum part of them, we might well imitate; and as for
the rest, is it not Emerson, who says:


"We are masters of the years,
Of the seven stars and golden spheres,
Of Cæsar's hand and Plato's brain,
Of Lord Christ's heart, and Shakespeare's strain?"


Our own religion and civilization are too potent, or
ought to be, to be affected by such a worship; and if its
simple rites comfort or content John in his rough transition
to the nineteenth century, let him practice them in
peace. If treated wisely, it will not be long before he
discards them forever.

So much for the Chinese in San Francisco. Elsewhere,
throughout California and Nevada, subsequently,
we saw them at work in vineyards, on farms, in the
mines, and their industry, fidelity, and skill were conceded
substantially by everybody. This Chinese Problem,
of course, has its embarrassments; but it is already
looming into importance, and must be met. Already we
have nearly a hundred thousand of these almond-eyed
strangers on the Pacific Coast, and the number swells
monthly. In spite of obstructions and discouragements,
this yellow stream sets steadily in, and seems as irresistible
as the tide, if not as inexhaustible. China, with her teeming
population of four hundred millions of souls, or one-third
of the human family, has already overflowed into all
the countries adjacent to her, and now seeks further outlet
here in America. To her, it is simply a question of
increase and subsistence. And here, fortunately, from
Alaska to the Isthmus, we have room enough and to[Pg 316]
spare, for all her surplus millions. With her, labor is a
drug, the cheapest article she has, and so she exports
it. With us, it is largely in demand, and everywhere
rising in value. The Pacific slope, and the great internal
basin of the continent, to-day absolutely need millions of
cheap workers       men, who can deftly handle the pick-axe
and the spade, the plow and the hoe, the shuttle and the
loom, and, it is plain, must get them from Asia, or not
get them at all; for the Atlantic slope, and our great
West, stand ready to absorb all Europe can spare, and
more. With John, their mines will be opened, their
forests cleared, their fields irrigated and tilled, their railroads
built, their cotton and woollen-mills erected and
run, and in short every avenue of industry and trade made
busy and prosperous. Without John, a vast expanse
of matchless territory there must remain practically a
wilderness and a desert, for long years to come. Is it
wise, then, would it be humane and sensible       to turn
aside from and reject these patient, industrious, orderly,
frugal, labor-seeking, business-loving strangers, whom
Providence just now seems to tender us, as a mighty
means for subduing and civilizing the continent; or
should we not, rather, accept them thankfully, as God's
instruments for good, and make the most of their brain
and muscle? The inexorable, all-prevailing law of supply
and demand, it would seem, has already settled this
question, or is in a fair way to settle it; and it but remains
to consider, what we shall do with them.

In the first place, John nowhere aspires to vote, nor
even to be a citizen. So far, his sole claim has been for
the right to work, and to receive "a fair day's wages for
a fair day's work." With the imperturbability of fate,
he has settled down on this, and calmly awaits our
answer, not doubting the result. If you object, that he[Pg 317]
persists in being a foreigner, all expecting some day to
return to China, his answer is all immigrants to a new
country are more or less of that mind; and, besides, as yet
nothing has been done to induce him to Americanize
himself. Their leading men said, no doubt many of their
countrymen would bring their wives and children here,
and settle down among us, if they could be sure of safety
and protection; but that now California was "no place
for a China woman       hardly safe for a Chinaman!"
They said, they had found America very good for
work, and "muchee" good for business; but they had
to pay odious taxes, not exacted of other persons       were
not permitted to testify in court, except for or
against each other       were abused and maltreated from one
end of the Coast to the other       were at the mercy of white
ruffians, who might rob and even kill them, with impunity,
unless Caucasians were present       and, in short,
that as yet Chinamen here "had no rights that Melican
men were bound to respect." Now, I say, let us change
all this. Let us do justice, even to the poorest and humblest
of God's children. Let us give John, too, "a fair
start and an equal chance in the race of life," the same as
every other human being on American soil; and we shall
soon check the re-flow to the Flowery Kingdom, and
build up an empire on the Pacific Coast, worthy of our
matchless soil and climate there. Existing labor and
skill might suffer somewhat at first, as in all industrial
changes; but, in the end, they would become employers,
and supply the brains to guide the Mongolian hand and
foot. The first generation passed away, the next de-Chinaized,
Americanized, and educated, would soon become
absorbed in the national life, and known only as
model artisans and workers. As the ocean receives all
rains and rivers, and yet shows it not, so America[Pg 318]
receives the Saxon and the Celt, the Protestant and the
Catholic, and can yet receive Sambo and John, and absorb
them all. The school-house and the church, the newspaper
and the telegraph, can be trusted to work out their
logical results; and time, our sure ally, would shape and
fashion even these into keen American citizens.

There were indications, that the Coast had fallen to
thinking seriously of all this, and somehow meant to
deal more justly with the Chinese hereafter. The anti-Chinese
mobs in the cities and towns were passing away,
and even among the mining-camps Vigilance Committees
were beginning to execute rough justice on thieves
and murderers, when their treatment of John became too
flagrant and notorious.[17] Capital, always keen-sighted,
was getting to see the necessity for their labor and skill,
and the culture and conscience of the Coast were already
on their side. Gov. Low, (since Minister to China, most
fittingly) presided at the Occidental Banquet, and in his
remarks there took strong ground in their favor. He
said, among other good things:



"We must learn to treat the Chinese who come to live
among us decently, and not oppress them by unfriendly
legislation, nor allow them to be abused, robbed and
murdered, without extending to them any adequate remedy.

"I am a strong believer in the strength of mind and
muscle of the Anglo-Saxon race, which will win in the
contest for supremacy with any people, without the aid of
unequal and oppressive laws; and the man, who is afraid
to take his chances on equal terms with his opponents, is a
coward and unworthy the name of an American.

"Were I to sum up the whole duty imposed upon us, I
should say, let us be honest, industrious and frugal, be
persevering and progressive, and remember Raleigh's[Pg 319]
maxim, that 'Whoever commands the sea commands the
trade of the world, and whoever commands the trade of
the world commands the riches of the world, and consequently
the world itself.'"

So, the pulpit, and the press, as a rule, omitted no opportunity
to speak a kind word for them, and to denounce
the barbarism, and absurdity, of existing statutes against
them. In San Francisco, a public-school had been
established for their benefit, and was crowded day and
night with adult Chinamen striving to learn English.
The public-school fund running short that year, (1867)
the Chinese merchants promptly volunteered to eke out
the appropriation, rather than have the Board of Education
close the school. Since then the Rev. Dr. Gibson,
(formerly a Methodist missionary to China, and a man of
great energy and force), has started his Sunday-Schools,
expecting to plant them all over the Coast, and there
seems a marked uprising in John's behalf generally.
True, Mr. Senator Casserly, himself a catholic foreigner
and the negro-hating democracy, are just now essaying
a crusade against them; but this is because the XVth
Amendment has ended the "nigger," and they are sadly
in want of political capital. Our churches have certainly,
now and here, a noble opportunity for effective and valuable
missionary work. Instead of having to go half
round the globe, across the sea, into malarious regions,
among Pagan influences, to seek out the lost sheep of
the House of Israel, we here have the heathen at our
back-door, and ought to unfurl the Banner of the Cross
to them, in every town and from every hillside. The
story of the Yankee, who gave a missionary-collector a
quarter of a dollar, and when he was leaving called him
back, and gave him a dollar more, "to send that quarter[Pg 320]
along," has it not some grains of truth in it? Here the
whole dollar and a quarter may be made immediately
effective, and our missionary money should be forthcoming
without stint. Not only would we thus more readily
and cheaply evangelize the Chinese on our shores, but
their returning thousands in turn would evangelize their
countrymen at home; and we would thus accomplish a
hundredfold more for China, than our missionaries there
now seem to be doing, judging by their statistics,
all put together. And not only do our Chinese themselves
call for this, but the harmony and purity of the
national life demand it, and may our churches awake to
their great responsibility. Here is their true field for
instant and aggressive missionary work, and they should
occupy it overwhelmingly.

From a full survey of this questio vexata, I must
conclude, if "God made of one blood all the nations of
men to dwell upon the earth," if we are children of a common
Father, redeemed by a common Saviour, and bound
for a common eternity; if the good old rule, "whatsoever
ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even
so unto them," (which the Chinese had in a negative
form a thousand years before the Sermon on the Mount),
is not yet effete; if we believe with Thomas Jefferson,
that "all men are created equal, and endowed by their
Creator with the inalienable rights of life and liberty;"
then, we are bound as a nation to accord justice and fair-play
even to these poor Mongolians, yellow-skinned, pig-tailed,
and heathen though they be. Now, as heretofore,
and always, we shall find our reward as a people in right-doing.
Right is always politic. Justice is never wrong.
And let us as a nation do right, even to the humblest of
God's creatures, and leave the consequences with Him,
who holds in his hands the destinies alike of individuals[Pg 321]
and of races. This is not always an easy road; but the
Republic has already travelled it so far, and so courageously,
we can not now afford to depart from it. Justice,
if the sky falls. But, we may be sure, it will not fall.
Rather, it will stand all the firmer and broader, for the
Justice done and Humanity saved.



[Pg 322]




CHAPTER XX.

SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELOS.


We left San Francisco, Feb. 9th, on the good ship
Orizaba, for southern California and Arizona.
She was a first-class side-wheel steamer, with good
accommodations, and belonged to the California Steam
Navigation Company       a corporation that then monopolized
or controlled all the navigable waters of California,
besides running coast-wise lines North and South. She
was one of a line, that ran semi-monthly to San Diego
and return, touching at Santa Barbara and San Pedro,
and seemed to be paying very well. We might have
gone southward from San Francisco to San Josè by railroad,
and thence by stage to Los Angelos and Fort
Yuma; but our long stage-rides, from the Missouri to
Salt Lake and thence to the Columbia, had worn the
romance off of stage-coaching, and we infinitely preferred
to proceed by steamer. It was a superb day, with sea
and sky both "darkly, deeply, beautifully blue"       a day
of the kind Californians always mean, when they brag
about their climate       as we flung off our lines at San
Francisco, and steamed down the harbor broadside with
the Golden Age en route for Panama. We passed by
Alcatraz and through the Golden Gate neck and neck,
with the decks of both vessels crowded with excited
passengers; but once across the bar, the Orizaba drew
steadily ahead, and long before sunset we left the Golden[Pg 323]
Age hull down astern. I don't say this was a race,
indeed. Perhaps their leaving together was quite
accidental. But the Orizaba soon showed her mettle,
all hands were eager and excited, and her officers were
in ecstasies at the results.

Once fairly at sea, our steamer turned her prow
sharply south, and all the way down followed the coast
from headland to headland. Usually we steamed along
some five or six miles off shore, with the land itself
always in view, and the ocean everywhere like a millpond.
From the Columbia to the Golden Gate in
December, we had found the Pacific to belie its name;
but now steaming farther south, we saw it in its calmness
and beauty, and felt like christening it anew. Most of
the way, the sky was magnificently clear, the weather
moderate, the air bracing and stimulating, while the
whole Coast was a shifting panorama of beauty and
grandeur. The ocean too smooth for sea-sickness, we
strolled about the deck by twos and fours, or lolled for
hours on the settees, inhaling life and vigor at every
breath, until we almost seemed to be navigating fabled
seas or voyaging into paradise. The Coast itself, never
out of sight, rose generally in abrupt hills or mountains,
and these were now green and gold to their summits.
In places, whole hillsides seemed alive with wild-flowers
of every hue, while here and there flocks and herds
dotted the landscape far and near. Now and then an
adobe house gleamed out of some sheltered nook; but,
as a rule, houses were infrequent, and trees and shrubbery
very scarce. A few stunted oaks and cedars fringed
the ravines here and there, but as a forest they were
nothing to speak of. The Coast Mountains lifted themselves
everywhere, smooth to the summit as if shaven,
with no glory of trees to shelter or crown them; and in[Pg 324]
summer, when their verdure dries up and blows away,
they must seem very bald and desolate.

At Santa Barbara, some three hundred miles down
the Coast, we touched for an hour or two, and put ashore
several passengers, and some thirty tons of freight.
While discharging the latter, we sauntered up into the
town, and found it to be a pleasant place of some fifteen
hundred inhabitants       county-seat to a county of the same
name. The buildings were mostly adobe, of course, and
all quite old; but the town had an appearance of comfort
and respectability, if not of thrift, and the few
Americans we met were sanguine of its future. The
Santa Barbara plains, just back of the town, consist of a
broad and beautiful valley, enclosed by two imposing
mountain ranges, that here jut obliquely into the ocean,
and they have a climate that is no doubt seldom equalled
even on the Pacific Coast. As a sanatarium, Santa Barbara
was already being much resorted to by invalids, and
doubtless will become more so when better known.
With great evenness of temperature the year round,[18]
without either snow or frost, or intense heat, the grape,
fig, orange, peach, pomegranate, olive, all nourish here
in the open air; and Nature seems so prodigal of her
gifts, the Santa Barbarans appear exempted from the
primal curse, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread, etc." Mountain streams from the neighboring
ranges, they had, however, trained into irrigating ditches,
and by these cultivated a considerable breadth of land.
They said, they had water sufficient to irrigate thousands
of acres more, and needed only capital and population
to build up a prosperous and thriving community. In
old times       "before the flood," as a Forty-Niner would
say       the Jesuit Fathers had one of their most flourishing[Pg 325]
Missions here, and their old Mission Church on a plateau
back of the town was still standing, though now used
chiefly as a school. Dr. O. formerly of the Army,
but now married to a señorita and settled at Santa
Barbara, escorted us through the town, and afterwards
regaled us with wine from his own vineyard,
of an excellent brand. He pronounced Santa Barbara,
with its fruits and its flowers, a second paradise, the only
place fit to live in       where one would about never die       and
half persuaded some of us to the same way of thinking.
The petroleum wells near there, as yet, had produced
but little; but there seemed no doubt of the petroleum
being there in large quantities. We had noticed
it floating on the sea for miles before reaching Santa
Barbara; and, if it issues beneath the sea sufficient for
this purpose, it ought to be struck somewhere in that
vicinity in paying quantities. The Santa Barbarans
by no means despaired of doing this yet, and thus hoped
to add another item to their already large and growing
products.
.
At San Pedro, the seaport of Los Angelos, a hundred
miles or so farther down the Coast, we put off some four
hundred tons of freight, and parted with the bulk of our
passengers. Of this place, more hereafter. Thence, past
Anaheim, a settlement of German wine-growers, we
steamed on down a hundred miles farther, and halted
at last at San Diego. A stiff breeze, freshening into
a gale, and a rough swell, followed us into San Diego;
but once inside the jaws of the harbor, we found the
bay almost unruffled, while all outside was wild and
threatening. The harbor, indeed, is quite land-locked,
and after San Francisco is the finest on the Pacific
Coast, below Puget Sound. But a few hundred
yards in width at the entrance, it soon spreads out into[Pg 326]
a broad and handsome bay, one or two miles wide by ten
or twelve long, and with a depth of water close in shore
sufficient to float the largest vessels. A bold promontory
running obliquely into the sea, as all the headlands on
this coast do, shelters the harbor perfectly from all north
and northwest winds, and contributes much to make San
Diego what it is. In the old Mexican times, before the
days of '49, San Diego was a leading Mission on the
Coast, and the chief seaport of California, whence she
shipped wool, hides, etc., and where she received supplies.
San Francisco, gushing young metropolis now,
was then only sterile Yerba Buena, and practically
nowhere.[19] When the rush of miners to California came
in '49, San Diego still held her own for awhile, quite
courageously. The Panama steamers then touched here
in going and coming. A large city was projected, and
built       on paper, with "water-fronts," "corner-lots," and
the like, quite in extenso. But there was no sufficient
back country       no mines or agricultural resources to speak
of       to support a town, and so in the end San Diego
incontinently collapsed. Poor Derby of the engineers,[Pg 327]
immortal as John Ph      nix, flourished here in those days,
and afterwards used to say in his own inimitable style,
he "Thanked heaven his lot was not cast in San Diego;
it had been, but was sold for taxes!" We anchored off
the old wharf, then fallen to decay, where in other days
the Panama steamers had floated proudly, and after
rowing well in were carried ashore on the shoulders of
Mexican peons. The U. S. barracks and corral, now
empty and without a watchman even, and a score or so
of other buildings, were grouped near the landing, constituting
New San Diego; but the main town, or Old
San Diego, was three miles off up the bay. A rickety
old ambulance, once U. S. property, but long since condemned
and sold, carried us up to the town, where we
spent several hours. Formerly numbering two or three
thousand inhabitants, and a pretty stirring place, it now
had only about two or three hundred, and was a good
illustration of some of California's changes. Its buildings,
of course, were all one-story adobe, but partly
inhabited, and these were grouped about a squalid,
Plaza, that reminded one of Mexico or Spain, rather than
the United States. Being the county-seat, of course, it
had a court-house and a jail       the one, a tumble-down
adobe       the other, literally a cage, made of boiler-iron,
six or seven feet square at the farthest. The day we
were there three men were brought in, arrested for horse-stealing,
or something of the sort; but as the jail would
accommodate only two       crowded at that       the judge discharged
the third, with an appropriate reprimand. At
least, we supposed it "appropriate;" but as it was in Californicè,
and the judge a native, we could make nothing
of it. In hot weather, this iron jail-cage must be a miniature
tophet; but, no doubt, it remains generally empty.
On a hill just back of the town, commanding it and the[Pg 328]
harbor, were the remains of Fort Stockton, which our
Jersey commodore of that name built and garrisoned
with his gallant Jack-Tars, during the Mexican war, and
held against all comers. Beyond it still, were the ruins
of the old Mexican Presidio, with palm and olive trees
scattered here and there, but all now desolate and forsaken.
The general broken-down, dilapidated, "played out" appearance
of the town, was certainly most forlorn. And
yet, the San Diegoans, like all good Californians, had
still a profound faith in their future, and swore by their
handsome bay as stoutly as ever. They knew San Diego
would yet be the western terminus of the Southern Pacific
Railroad, whenever this got itself built; and with this,
they fondly believed, would come population, prosperity,
power (the three great p's of modern civilization),
and come to stay. With the exception of a handful of
Americans and Jews, engaged chiefly in merchandizing,
the inhabitants consisted mainly of native Californians,
in all stages of impecuniosity. Being steamer-day, several
Americans       most of them ex-army officers       had galloped
in from their neighboring ranches, some coming
ten and twenty miles for this purpose, and all were as
hospitable and warm-hearted, as men leading such a life
usually are. They laughed and chatted over their California
experiences, predicted great things for San Diego
yet, and offered a hundred acres or more from their
leagues-square ranches, to any American who would
come and settle among them. All united in pronouncing
the climate simply perfect, though a little warm in summer;
and, I must say, it really seemed so, when we were
there. They declared the thermometer never varied
more than twenty degrees the year round, and maintained
people never died there, except from the knife or
bullet. When reminded of a Mr. S. who had died that[Pg 329]
morning, they replied, he came there too late       a confirmed
consumptive; otherwise, he would have got well,
and in the end have shrivelled up and evaporated, like
the rest of their aged people.

As to business, the town really seemed to have none,
except a little merchandizing and whiskey-drinking, and
these only gave signs of life, because it was "steamer-day."
The country immediately about the town was
dull and barren, from want of water to irrigate and
cultivate it. The great ranches were at a distance, and
these depended on streams from the Coast Range, that
mostly disappeared before reaching the harbor. Here
horses, cattle, and sheep were raised in considerable numbers;
but the breadth of valuable land was not considered
large, and the population of the section seemed to
be on the stand-still, if not decrease. A railroad from
the Atlantic States, and another north to San Francisco,
would of course soon change all this; but these were
yet in the future. The splendid harbor, however, is
there       the second as I have said, on the California Coast       and
it will be passing strange, if the future does not
evolve something, that will give it vitality and importance.
Its noble waters, surely, cannot lie idle forever.
With its superb anchorage and far-stretching shores, it
seemed already the prophecy of great things to come,
and I sincerely trust the San Diegoans may speedily
realize them.[20]

Down by the mouth of the harbor, were several
fishermen's huts, whose owners, it was said, gained a
precarious living by whaling. Off the harbor, for miles[Pg 330]
up and down the coast, we noticed a heavy growth of
kelp or sea-weed, and this we were told the whales
frequented in certain seasons of the year, as a feeding
ground. We kept a sharp lookout for them, both coming
down and returning; but were rewarded by seeing
only a single dead one, which had been harpooned and
left floating near shore, with a buoy attached. Capt.
Thorne, of the Orizaba, reported these whales as quite
numerous off the coast sometimes, and thought this
business might readily be made much more lucrative,
than it was.

Here at San Diego, we were about five hundred
miles south of San Francisco, and less than one hundred
and fifty from Fort Yuma. We had expected to find a
stage thence to Fort Yuma; but the line had recently
been withdrawn,[21] from want of business, and we were
compelled to return again up the coast to San Pedro and
Los Angelos. On the evening of Feb. 14th, we accordingly
bade good-bye to San Diego, and the next morning,
when we came on deck, found the Orizaba at anchor
again off San Pedro. This, as I have before said, is the
old seaport or landing for Los Angelos, and all the
country about there, whence supplies were then wagoned
into Arizona, Southern Nevada, and even Utah. The
Salt Lake merchants, then barred from the East in
winter by the heavy snows on the Rocky Mountains,
were in the habit of eking out their stocks by purchases
in San Francisco, which they shipped 400 miles down
the coast to San Pedro, and from here wagoned them
via San Bernardino and Cajon Pass, through Southern
Nevada, 800 miles more to Great Salt Lake. Of course,
the completion of the Pacific Railroad has changed all
this. San Pedro itself, unfortunately, has no harbor, but[Pg 331]
is a mere open roadstead, where vessels may ride at
anchor in fine weather, but when storms come must slip
to sea. From here a slough or gut of the sea sets up to
Wilmington, some six miles through a tide-water marsh,
where we found a Mr. Phineas Banning doing his "level
best"       and it was a big "best"       to build up a nascent
city. Formerly, everything was lightered ashore at San
Pedro; but recently, Mr. Banning had introduced steam-tugs,
and with these at high tide he carried everything to
Wilmington, where he had wharves, store-houses, shops,
stages, wagon-trains, and about everything else, on a
large scale. He was an enterprising Delawarean, but
without much regard for "the eyes of Delaware;"
had failed two or three times, but was still wide-awake
and keen for business; had come to California
a common stage-driver, but now ran lines of stages
and freight-wagons of his own all over southern California
and Arizona, for eight hundred and a thousand
miles; had married a native señorita, with several
leagues of land, and made her a good husband; was now
state senator on the Republican side, and talked of for
governor; and, in short, was a good second edition of
Mr. Ben Holliday, yet without his bad politics. His
town of Wilmington consisted of a hundred or two
frame buildings, in true border style, with perhaps five
hundred inhabitants, all more or less in his service, or
employed at Drum Barracks, the U. S. military post there.
A man of large and liberal ideas, with great native force
of character and power of endurance, he was invaluable to
Southern California and Arizona, and both of these sections
owe him a debt of gratitude, which they never can
repay. His "latch-string" was always out to all strangers
in that latitude; there was no public interest with which
he was not prominently identified; and from San Pedro[Pg 332]
to Tucson, and back again, via Prescott and Fort Mojave,
through some fifteen hundred miles of border travel,
there was scarcely a day in which we did not see his
teams or stages, or touch his enterprises somewhere.

Here at Wilmington, in the village barber, we found
another good illustration of the adaptativeness of the
average American. Originally from Independence, Mo.,
he had emigrated thence to Oregon, thence to San Francisco,
and thence to Wilmington. In Missouri, he was
a farmer by occupation; in Oregon, a cattle-drover; in
San Francisco, a teamster; in Wilmington, he was now
regularly a barber, but occasionally cobbled shoes, or
worked as a blacksmith, and on a pinch also practiced
medicine. He had not preached, or edited a newspaper
yet; but doubtless would have had no objection to trying
his hand at either or both of these, should opportunity
offer or necessity occur! But such men, after all,
are our Representative Americans       real pioneers of
empire and champions of civilization       and history will
not forget to recognize and respect them accordingly.

Back of Wilmington, some thirty miles wide by seventy-five
long, from the Pacific to the Mountains, stretch
the great Los Angelos plains, than which there are few
finer sights on the Coast, at the proper season. Just now
they were green with herbage and gemmed with wild
flowers in all directions, from the Mountains to the
ocean, a perfect sea of verdure, with flocks and herds roaming
over them at will, under the guidance of native
rancheros. The latter, mounted on gamey little horses, full-blooded
mustangs, with saddles that nearly covered their
steeds, and tinkling spurs that almost swept the ground,
galloped hither and yon as occasion needed, or lolled for
hours on the ground, basking in the sun, while their cattle
and sheep fed peacefully about them. The landscape[Pg 333]
one day, when Gen. Banning drove us over to Los Angelos,
to see the vineyards and orange-groves there, with
the Pacific rolling in the distance, the Mountains towering
before us, and the Plains stretching all about us, in
green and purple and gold, was a perfect idyllic scene,
which lingers in my memory yet, as one of the fairest
recollections of a life-time. Just then, the marshes about
Wilmington, and the Plains beyond, were a halting place
for vast flocks of wild-geese, on their annual migration
north, and they thronged the country in countless thousands.
Off on the Plains, where they were feeding on
the young and succulent grass, they whitened the ground
sometimes for acres, and were so careless of danger, you
might knock them over with a club. Gen. Banning
said, they were even more numerous in former years, but
even as they were, we had never seen anything to equal
them. As we drove along, they rose up by the roadside
in flocks of thousands, and fairly deafened the air with
their multitudinous konkings. Further on, we found
the grass rank and luxuriant, and it seemed impossible
to believe, that when summer came, all this wealth of
vegetation would wither up, and substantially blow away.
Yet this seemed to be the fact       these broad and beautiful
Plains, beneath their then rainless sky, becoming
everywhere a barren desert, save where acequias (Mexican
for "water-ditches") regularly irrigate and vitalize
them.

We struck the acequias several miles out from Los
Angelos, and followed them into the town, our road
winding about among and crossing them several times.
They are simply water-ditches, four or five feet wide
by one deep, the same as those at Salt Lake, but most
of them far older. They were begun a century ago, by
the old Spanish Jesuits, who formerly had one of their[Pg 334]
largest and most flourishing Missions here, and are kept
in repair and regulated by the city corporation       the water
being farmed out, at fixed rates. Their source of supply
is the Los Angelos river, a little stream that issues from
the Coast Range some miles away, and sinks again, I
believe, before reaching the ocean. If husbanded properly,
with the same care exercised at Salt Lake, it might
be made to irrigate many times the present breadth of
land, it would seem; but as it is, it suffices to vitalize
hundreds, if not thousands, of acres about the town,
where they grow wheat, barley, oats, the grape, the
orange, the lemon, citron, olive, peach, pear, and almost
everything else, in great profusion and of the finest character.
Along the road, and skirting all the main acequias,
willows have been planted, and these growing
rapidly serve for both fencing and fuel. Here and there
wild flowers also have been planted, or have sprung up
naturally among the hedges, and these shower their
wealth of bloom and fragrance almost the year round.
The robin, the blue-bird, the oriole, abounded here; and
the whole air seemed vocal with song, as we whirled
along through the suburbs, and up into the town.

Los Angelos itself proved to be a brisk and thriving
town. It is the county-seat of a large county of the
same name, and probably contained then some five thousand
inhabitants       about one-third Americans and Europeans,
and the balance native Californians and Indians.
The Americans seemed to own most of the houses and
lands, the Europeans       chiefly Jews       to do the business,
the native Californians to do the loafing, and the Indians
to perform the labor. It had mail communication with
San Francisco twice a week by stage, and twice a month
by steamer via San Pedro, and telegraphic communication
via San Francisco with the whole coast and country.[Pg 335]
It boasted two or three very fair hotels, a fine old
Spanish church, and quite a number of brick and frame
residences, that would have been called creditable anywhere.
The town seemed steadily increasing in wealth
and population, as more and more of the surrounding
Plains were brought under cultivation, and already had
a substantial basis for prosperity in its vineyards and
fruit-orchards, aside from its flocks and herds. It was also
doing a considerable business with Utah, Arizona, and
Southern California, for all which regions it was then
largely a mart and entrepot. Its climate was mild and
equable, reminding one more of Italy and the Levant,
than America, and already it was quite a resort for
invalids from all parts of the Coast. Then in February,
and again in May, when we returned there from Arizona,
the air really seemed like the elixir of life, and quickened
every sense into new life and power of enjoyment. As
in all Spanish American towns, however, Sunday seemed
to be the chief day for business and pleasure. A few
stores and shops were closed; but the majority kept
open, the same as any other day. The native Californian
and Indian population of the surrounding country flocked
into town that day, in holiday attire and, after a brief
service at the old church (dedicated "To the Queen
of the Angels,") assembled in the Plaza, to witness their
customary cock-fights. There were several of these,
which men and women, priests and people       alike eager
and excited       all seemed to enjoy; but to us, Eastern-bred,
they seemed cruel and barbarous. The poor fowls
pecked away at each other, until some fell dead, and
others dropped exhausted, when the survivors were
borne away in triumph.

A ride across the breezy Plains, ten miles to the
south, brought us to the ranch and vineyard of Mr.[Pg 336]
Ben. D. Wilson, noted over all the Coast for his excellent
fruits and wines. "Don Benito" Wilson, he is called
out there, and the name is a good one. Without
much urban polish, he is nevertheless one of nature's
noblemen, and a fine Representative Californian. A
Tennessean by birth, long before the acquisition of
California, he had hunted and trapped across the
continent, living for years among the Utes and Apaches,
and finally marrying a California señorita, with
three leagues square of land, had settled down here.
His noble ranch lies at the foot of the Coast Range of
mountains, with their snow-clad summits towering above,
the Los Angelos plains in front stretching away to the
ocean, while an intervening roll of hills shuts out the
raw winds and fogs of the summer and autumn. Two
or three dashing rivulets, that issue from the mountains
like threads of silver, have been caught up and carried
by acequias all along the slopes, whence they are distributed
wherever the thirsty soil in summer needs them.
Here he has orange, lemon, peach, olive, almond, and
English walnut groves, by the many acres, while beyond
are his vineyards by the hundred acres       part planted
by himself, but many a half century ago by the Jesuit
Fathers. Just now, his vineyards, trimmed closely as they
were, looked for all the world like a Delaware or Jersey
field of old peach-trees, with the tops sawn off, as we
sometimes see them here. Without trellis or support of
any kind, these aged vines stood stiff and gnarled,
in rows five or six feet apart, themselves about as many
inches thick; but in summer, they throw out runners,
that form a leafy wilderness, loaded down with the purpling
clusters. In addition, he had great herds of horses,
and cattle, and flocks of sheep by the thousand, that
roamed over his outlying broad acres and the Los Angelos[Pg 337]
plains at will. In sauntering through his orange-groves,
he showed us trees, from which he had gathered twenty-five
dollars' worth of the golden fruit each, that season,
and one that yielded him forty dollars' worth. A few of
his oranges, dead ripe, were still gleaming amid the rich,
deep green of their peculiar foliage, and we had some of
these fresh and luscious on the table each meal we took
with him. In his wine-cellars, back of the mansion, he
showed us two hundred thousand gallons of wine, the
product of that year's vintage alone, and it hadn't been
much of a year for wine either. This he reported to be
worth only fifty cents a gallon then, but as increasing in
price, of course, with age. He made both white and red
wine, of a superior brand, and had branch houses in San
Francisco and New York, that disposed of the bulk of it
at fair figures. It all had the peculiar sharpness and
alcoholic qualities of the California wines generally;
but, he thought, with more careful culture, and increasing
age, their wines would improve in this respect. He
computed the wine-product of California then, at not less
than three millions of gallons annually, and rapidly
increasing. The Mission grape was the one mostly
grown, as yet; but he thought some foreign varieties,
of a finer quality, would gradually supplant this. The
white wines were the pure juice of the grape; the red the
same, but with the color of the skins added. Farther
North, the Sonoma and Sacramento wines were lighter
and milder, resembling claret and hock; but these Los
Angelos wines were heavy and strong, with a body like
those of Spain, whence no doubt the Mission vines originally
came. The expressed juice was first put into
large casks, holding a hundred and forty gallons or more
each, whence after due fermentation it was bottled and
sent to market. He said at the end of a year and a half,[Pg 338]
the wine usually became clear and less alcoholic; but it
continued to mellow and soften with age for twenty
years, when its delicacy of flavor and oiliness of consistency
culminated. Brandy was made from indifferent
or miscellaneous grapes, skins and all, and from what we
saw of its effects, was as fierce and fiery a liquid, surely,
as Jersey lightning, or Nebraska needle-gun.

Mr. Wilson lived rather plainly, in anything but a
palatial mansion; but he had a fine library, well-selected,
and took most of the leading magazines and newspapers,
from San Francisco to Boston. We were really surprised
at the extent and variety of his periodical literature. He
said he had been intending for years to build himself a
new house, on a grander scale; but the old one was very
roomy and comfortable, and he had never found time to
pull it down. We found him a very bright and intelligent
old gentleman, well versed in the world's affairs,
with an eye keenly alive to passing events both at home
and abroad, notwithstanding his seclusion. He was
a warm friend of Gen. Banning's; for they naturally
comprehended, and appreciated each other, to the full.

Land just about Los Angelos, and adjacent to the
acequias, was held at a good figure; but a few miles
from the town, it was selling at only five and ten dollars
per acre, and a great stock or fruit ranch, it would seem,
could be built up here, at small expense, in a few years.
The soil and climate are certainly all anybody could
desire; the chief drawbacks seemed to be the absence of
good schools and churches. These, however, will come
with time and sufficient Yankees; and it is not too much
to say, that the Plains and City of the Angels will yet
become widely known, and well-peopled. California,
rich in so many things, may yet well be vain of them.

CHAPTER XXI.

WILMINGTON TO FORT YUMA.


We had intended to go by stage from Los Angelos
to Fort Yuma, to save time, though we knew it
would be a "weariness to the flesh;" but the route
had just been changed there from San Diego, and
as it would take a fortnight to transfer the stock, and get
things to working smoothly again, we decided to proceed
by ambulance. To this end, we returned to
Wilmington, or Drum Barracks, the military post there,
whence we left for Arizona, Feb. 19th. Our "outfit,"
furnished by the quartermaster there, consisted of a
substantial vehicle, half-ambulance and half-Jersey
wagon, loaned for the trip by Gen. Banning, equipped
with four stout mules and a plucky driver. A fifth
mule was also added, to meet contingencies; but this
was only as a led mule. The vehicle was a contrivance
of Gen. Banning's own, with a boot before and
behind, capacious boxes under the seats, pockets for
books and periodicals, slings for rifles, pistols, etc., which
he was accustomed to use in his own long trips through
Southern California and Arizona, looking after his widely
extended business. Originally, we designed using this
only as far as Fort Yuma; but afterwards it proved to be
our home for two months, through fifteen hundred miles or
more of long and desolate land-travel. A gentleman from
San Francisco, connected with the Post-Office department,[Pg 340]
(Hon. B. T.), accompanied me, and relieved the
tedium of many an hour by his rare wit and humor.
Our baggage consisted only of a light valise and roll of
blankets each, a box of writing-materials and official
orders, a sack or two of barley and oats, and some packages
of canned fruits and vegetables. For lodgings and
provisions generally, we decided to depend on the
scattered ranches and stage-stations, notwithstanding
vague rumors we would be likely to "rough it," in doing
so. With "Adios!" and "Good luck to you!" from
broad-shouldered, big-hearted Gen. Banning, we rolled
out of Wilmington one day toward noon; and crossing
numerous sloughs and quicksands, past countless flocks
of wild-geese, arrived the same evening at Anaheim.

Here we found quite a settlement of Germans, fresh
from Rhineland, engaged chiefly in wine-making. It
appears, they had clubbed together in San Francisco,
and bought a thousand acres of the Los Angelos Plains,
bordering on the Santa Anna river, whose waters they
now used for irrigating purposes. This they divided
into twenty-acre lots, with a town-plot in the centre and
convenient streets, each lot-holder being also owner of a
town-lot of half an acre besides. Here were some five
hundred or more Germans, all industriously engaged, and
exhibiting of course their usual sagacity and thrift.
They had constructed acequias, and carried the hitherto
useless Santa Anna river everywhere       around and
through their lots, and past every door; they had hedged
their little farms with willows, and planted them with
vines, orange, lemon, and olive trees; and the once barren
plains in summer were now alive with perpetual foliage
and verdure. Of course, there had consequently been a
great rise in values. The land had cost them only two
dollars per acre in 1857; but now in 1867, it was rated[Pg 341]
at one hundred and fifty dollars, with none to sell. We
drove through the clean and well-kept avenues or streets,
scenting Rhineland on every side; and, indeed, this
Anaheim itself is nothing but a bit of Germany, dropped
down on the Pacific Coast. It has little in common
with Los Angelos the dirty, but the glorious climate and
soil, and was an agreeable surprise every way. We
halted at the village-inn, which would have passed very
well for a Wein-Haus in Fatherland, and were entertained
very nicely. The proprietor was also the village-schoolmaster,
and his frau was one of the brightest and
neatest little house-keepers, we had seen on the Coast.
They gave us bologna sausage and native wine for supper,
as well as excellent tea; and when bed time came, we
were conducted to apartments unimpeachable every way.
In the course of the evening, half the village seemed to
drop in for a sip of wine or glass of beer (they kept
both, of course), and the guest-room became so thick with
smoke, you could have cut it with a knife. The next
morning they gave us some wine for our trip, five years
old, that had lost much of its alcoholic properties,
and so soft and oily, it would have passed for tolerable
Hockheimer, or even Johannisberger, almost anywhere.

Here we bade good-bye to civilization, and at last
were fairly off for Arizona. The distance from Wilmington
to Yuma is about three hundred miles, and we
hoped to make it in ten days at the farthest. We got an
early start from Anaheim, and crossing the Santa Anna
river through a congeries of quicksands rode all day, with
the Coast Range to the right of us, and another serrated
ridge ten or twelve miles off to the left, through what
was mostly an arid and sterile plain, though here and
there it was broken up into ravines and "arroyas," or[Pg 342]
dry water-courses, abounding in cottonwood and live-oaks.
Just at sunset, we crossed a divide, and before us
lay a sheet of water, five miles long by two wide,
reposing like a sea of silver, skirted by wide plateaus, and
these in turn flanked by outlying ranges of mountains.
This was Laguna Grande, the pet lake of all that region.
Draining a wide extent of country, it always remains a
large body of water, though in summer much of it disappears,
and the balance becomes brackish from alkali.
It continues palatable, however, for horses and cattle,
and accordingly here we found a great hacienda, one of
the largest, south of Los Angelos. The proprietors were
two brothers Machado, who here owned leagues square
of land, from the summit of one mountain range to the
other, including the Laguna. They lived in a rude
adobe hut, with three rooms, that no common laborer
East would think of inhabiting; but they numbered
their live-stock by the thousand, and esteemed their rude
home a second paradise. They raised a little barley and
some beans on a few acres, bordering on the lagoon; but
devoted the great bulk of their broad acres to stock-raising.
Señor Dolores Machado met us at the door, as
we drove up; but as he could speak no English, and we
no Spanish, there seemed to be a predicament. Before
leaving Los Angelos, we had anticipated this, knowing
the old Mexican or Spanish-speaking population still
prevailed over most of Southern California and Arizona,
and had provided ourselves with "Butler's method of
learning to speak Spanish quickly," accordingly. We
had conned this over several days, selecting the phrases
that would apparently be most useful, and now assailed
Señor Machado with everything we could summon.
Imagine our disgust, when he looked wild at our
attempted Spanish, and responded to every phrase, "No[Pg 343]
sabe, Señors!" Our driver, Worth, at last came to our
rescue, with some mongrel Spanish he had picked up,
when soldiering formerly down in Arizona; and when
Señor M. understood we only wanted entertainment for
the night, he smilingly replied, "O, Si! Señors! Si! Si!"
"Yes! Yes!" with true Castilian grace, and invited us
into his abode. He gave us a rough but substantial
meal, of coffee, frejoles, and mutton; and when bedtime
came, allowed us the privilege of spreading our blankets
on the softest part of the only board floor in the house.
He and his wife occupied a rude bed in one corner of
the same room, while his brother slept on one in another.
There was not, and never had been, a pane of glass in
the house, notwithstanding they were such large-landed
proprietors. The breeze stole in at the broken shutter,
that closed the only window in the room, and all night
long we could count the stars through the dilapidated
roof.

Thence to Buena Vista, we passed through a succession
of small valleys, between the same general mountain
ranges before mentioned. Though wanting in water,
yet these all had small streams of some sort flowing
through them, which if carefully husbanded could be
made to irrigate thousands of fertile acres all through
here. Cottonwoods occurred frequently, and along many
of the bottoms there was a goodly growth of scrubby live-oaks,
that looked particularly green and inviting amidst
those arid landscapes. Buena Vista valley seemed to be
the outlet of several others, all of which might be largely
reclaimed, with proper industry and effort. The soil is
rich, the water there, and the climate matchless apparently
the year round. Warner's Ranch stands in the
midst of Buena Vista valley, and consists only of an
adobe hut or two, that answer for grocery and road-side[Pg 344]
inn. We were detained here a day, by a severe rain
that set in at nightfall, just after our arrival, and continued
for twenty-four hours; but as it gave us and our
team a bit of rest, we did not greatly regret it. Thence
to Villacito, the valley opened broader and wider, and
the grand San Bernardino peak       which day after day
had dominated the landscape off to the right       its outlines
sharply defined against that exquisite sky       dropped
gradually out of sight.

Here we struck the southern California or great
Colorado Desert, and thence on to Yuma       one hundred
and fifty miles       we might as well have been adrift on
the Great Sahara itself. Until we reached this point,
the country consisted chiefly of arid plains, it is true;
but broken, more or less, into ravines and valleys, with
some semblance of life, or at least capacity for supporting
life hereafter, should sufficient intelligence and labor
ever drift that way. But as we approached the Desert,
all this ceased, and the very genius of desolation seemed
to brood over the landscape. We descended into it
through a narrow rocky cañon, so rough and precipitous,
that T. and I both got out and walked down, leaving the
driver to navigate the empty ambulance to the foot, the
best he could. Jolting and jumping from rock to gully,
now half upset, with wheels spinning in the air, and now
all right again, he got down safe and whole at last, and
we augured well of our wheels and springs, after such a
rugged experience.

Quitting Villacito, we found the road sandy and
heavy, the air sultry and hot, and the nearest water
eighteen miles off at Carissa Creek. The country was
one dreary succession of sand and gravel, barren peaks
and rocky ridges, with arroyas now and then, but no
signs of humidity anywhere. It was not, however, such[Pg 345]
a perfect desert, as we had anticipated; for here and
there were clumps of chemisal, mescal, and cactus, and
these somewhat relieved the general dreariness of the
landscape, poor apologies as they are for trees and shrubbery.
The chemisal grows in clumps, something like
our alder-bushes east, but with rods straighter and
slenderer, bearing a pale-green leaf. The mescal seems
to be a bastard variety of aloes, much similar to what is
popularly known as Eve's Thread, though on a larger
scale. The Mexicans and Indians distil a villainous
liquor from it, which they also call "Mescal," that
is worse in its effects than even fusel-oil or strychnine-whiskey.
The cacti appeared to be of several varieties       many
the same as we have in conservatories east, but all
vastly larger here. The flora, as we proceeded southward,
constantly became sparser and thornier; but the
fauna continued about the same       the chief species being
jack-rabbits and California quails       the latter a very
handsome variety, with top-knots, never seen east.
The rabbits were numerous, and the quails whirred
across our road in coveys quite frequently, until we were
well into the Desert, when both mainly disappeared. We
reached Carissa Creek, with its welcome though brackish
water, about 2 p. m.; but as it was thirty-three miles
yet to the next certain water, at Laguna, with only uncertain
wells between (dug by the Government), concerning
which we could get no definite information, we
concluded to halt there till morning.

From there on, the first few miles were about the
same as the day before. Then we ascended an abrupt
bluff, that looked in the distance like an impassable castellated
wall, and suddenly found ourselves on an elevated
mesa or table-land, the very embodiment of dreariness
and desolation. On all sides, it was a vast, outstretched[Pg 346]
plain, of coarse sand and gravel, without tree, or shrub,
or living thing       even the inevitable mescal and cactus
here disappeared. Behind us, to the north and east, there
was a weird succession of grand terraces and castellated
mountains, reminding one of portions of Wyoming. On
our right, to the west, the ever-present Coast Range
loomed along the landscape, barren and ghostly. To the
south, all was a dead level, panting and quivering
beneath the sun, as he neared the zenith, except where
here and there a heavy mirage obscured the view, or
vast whirlwinds careered over the desert, miles away       their
immense spirals circling upward to the very sky.
These last, on first sight, we took for columns of smoke,
so erect and vast were they. But soon they rose all
along the southwestern horizon, one after another, like
mighty genii on the march, and our driver bade us look
out for a Yuma sand-storm. We had already here and
there found the sand drifted into ridges, like snow-banks,
where sand-storms had preceded us, and had heard ugly
accounts of them before leaving Wilmington; but, fortunately,
we escaped this one       the whirlwinds keeping
away to the southwest, where they hugged the Coast
Range, and in the course of the afternoon obscured the
whole landscape there. This was now the Colorado or
Yuma Desert in earnest, without bird, or beast, or bush,
or sign of life anywhere       nothing, in fact, but barrenness
and desolation, as much as any region could well be.
A large portion of it is so low, that the overflow of the
Colorado often reaches it during spring freshets, and
remains for weeks. In travelling over this portion, now
baked dry and hard beneath the sun, we had frequent
exhibitions of mirage, on a magnificent scale. One day
in particular, we had been driving since early morning,
over a heavy sandy road, with the sun blazing down upon[Pg 347]
us like a ball of fire, with no water since starting, our
poor mules panting with heat and thirst, when long after
noon we observed       apparently a mile or so ahead       what
seemed like a great outspread pond or lake, with little
islands here and there, their edges fringed with bushes,
whose very images appeared reflected in the water. The
scene was so perfect, that the driver and T. both insisted
it must be water; however, I inclined to believe it mirage,
as it afterwards turned out, but the optical illusion
was so complete in this and other instances, that when
later in the day we really did approach a veritable sheet
of water at the Laguna, we all of us mistook this for
mirage also. Here, however, we found a body of water
a mile long by half a mile wide, surrounded by a rank
growth of coarse grass, and covered with water-fowl       a
perfect oasis in the desert. This was also a part of the
overflow of the Colorado, there being a depression in
the Desert just here, which holds the water like a cup.
The quantity is so large, that it lasts for two seasons;
but after that, is apt to dry up, if the overflow does not
come. But as this usually happens every year, this
Laguna (Spanish for lagoon or lake) becomes a perfect
god-send to the traveller here. On its southern margin,
a Mr. Ganow from Illinois had established a ranch, and
already was acquiring a comfortable home. His horses
and cattle found ample subsistence in the brakes, on the
borders of the lagoon, and the passing travel to and from
California and Arizona made him considerable patronage
in the course of the year.

Thence past Alamo to Pilot Knob, where we rounded
the corner of the mountains, and struck the valley
proper of the Colorado, the country continued more or
less an unbroken desert. The roads were heavy and
dusty, the air hot and stifling, the landscape barren and[Pg 348]
monotonous; and when, at last, we made Pilot Knob
and struck the river, eight or ten miles below Fort Yuma,
we rejoiced heartily, that the first stage of our tour was
so nearly over. The Colorado flowed by our side, red
and sluggish, but of goodly volume; the breeze came to
us cool and moist across its broad bosom; and as we
neared the post, the garrison-flag floating high in air
seemed to beckon us onward, and welcome us beneath its
folds. Starting long before daylight, and lying by in
the middle of the day, we had driven fifty-three miles
that day, over a country that equals, if it does not surpass
Bitter Creek itself (see p. 150-3); and when at last
we drew rein at Fort Yuma, we were thoroughly jaded
ourselves, and our poor animals quite fagged out. We
had made the distance from Wilmington in nine driving
days, instead of ten; but they seemed the longest we had
ever driven.

Of the intervening country as a whole, especially
from Villacito, it may justly be said, not only is it practically
a desert, but even what streams it has seem to be
slowly but surely disappearing. There were evidences
frequently, that the country had formerly been much better
watered than now, and the population       sparse as it was       appeared
to be diminishing. After leaving Anaheim,
there was only a scattered ranch here and there, every ten
or twelve miles apart, of the rudest character       sometimes
not even these       where coarse groceries, canned fruits and
vegetables, and whiskey and mescal, were kept for sale to
Indians and passing travellers. These had mostly been
stage-stations on the great Butterfield Overland Route
before the war, and when this broke that up, these
ranchmen still remained, hoping something would "turn
up." The station at Carissa Creek was a good representative
of this, and likewise of many others. "Carissa[Pg 349]
Creek" itself is one of southern California's "blind"
streams, like so many in Arizona, beginning and ending
nowhere in particular       without either source or mouth
apparently. Issuing from a sand-heap, it terminates in
another a few miles away; but just here at the station
is a shallow creek       a few yards wide, by six inches
deep       tainted, of course with alkali. The station itself
is the adobe remains of an old stage-station, whose roof
was all gone, and as a substitute the enterprising proprietor
had thrown some poles across, and covered them
with willows and coarse grass. This turned the sun
somewhat, and the easy-going proprietor said, "'Twer'nt
no use, no how, to roof agin rain; 'cause, you bet, stranger,
no rain ever gits yer!" His forlorn structure, part
of which was used for a chicken-roost, also served its
owner as bar-room, grocery, kitchen, parlor, bed-room,
etc., and yet contained only one rude apartment, altogether.

"Mine host" here was a Texan, who somehow had
strayed away out here, and dropped down at Carissa
Creek       he hardly knew how. He "didn't think it much
of a place, that's a fact; no how, stranger! But then,
you see, I'm yer; and it's a heap of trouble to move
elsewhar! Besides, yer know, I couldn't recommend
nobody else to buy me out, no how! Somebody has got
to live at Carissa Creek, anyhow; and why not me?"
His philosophy, under the circumstances, seemed delicious,
worthy of Mr. Mark Tapley himself, and, of course,
we had not the heart to disturb it.

For meals and lodgings en route, we did indeed have
to "rough it" pretty generally, nearly everywhere       especially
after passing Villacito. Salt pork fried, saleratus
biscuit hot, and coffee plain, came again into vogue,
as in the famous Bitter Creek region; but we supplemented[Pg 350]
them this time with some excellent canned
fruits and vegetables, that we had the foresight to bring
along. Our evenings usually ended in long "yarns," after
which, spreading our blankets in the hay-corral, or on a
sand-heap, we went cosily to sleep beneath the stars. We
always slept with our revolvers under our heads, and our
rifles by our sides; and though a bit nervous sometimes
when we reflected how much we were at the mercy of
the rough customers we met en route, yet we slept well,
and went through safely.

At Porte de la Cruz, before reaching the Desert, we
passed an Indian village; but they all seemed quiet and
peaceable. They belonged to the Dieganos, a tribe
extending from the Coast Range to the Colorado, and
wandering over much of the country we had passed
through. A score or more of them lay basking in the
sun, as we drove by, and they seemed to be about as
helpless and idiotic a people, as human nature could well
furnish. They are said to subsist chiefly on snakes,
lizards, grasshoppers, mescal, etc., and appeared to be
worse off than any Red Skins we had encountered yet.
At Laguna, in the midst of the Desert, we chanced
upon another party of them. As we drove up to Mr.
Ganow's, the station-keeper there, we observed quite a
crowd of them running around the corner of the lagoon,
and making for the station. We supposed, at first, that
our arrival was the sensation that attracted them; but as
they drew nearer, we saw they were angry and excited,
and Mr. Ganow presently explained, that one of them
had been robbed of a knife and a silver dollar by a white
man at Indian Wells       some four miles farther on       and,
when afterwards he remonstrated, the white man had tied
him up and flogged him. The poor wretch, still bruised
and bleeding, now came with twenty or thirty of his[Pg 351]
comrades, from their camp beyond the Laguna, to Mr.
Ganow       to report the outrage and seek redress. Ganow
said the white man referred to was a mean fellow, bad
enough for anything, who made a living chiefly by
gambling with the Indians, and selling them mescal and
needle-gun whiskey, and that he kept the countryside in
a constant turmoil. He advised his copper-colored friends
to return to the Wells, and demand their property again,
and say a U. S. officer was at his ranch, and would be
along next day and look after him, if he did not give it
up. This seemed to satisfy them, and they all started
off on a long trot, kicking a ball before them as they
ran, and were soon out of sight. One of them, rejoicing
in the name of Charley, was dressed in cast-off army-clothing,
and spoke broken-English pretty well. We gave
him a handful of cigarritos and matches, in return for
his broken talk, and he went trotting off with the rest.

That night we spread our blankets as usual, in the
corral, at the foot of a hay-stack, and before going to
sleep fell to talking about this affair, and its possible consequences       perhaps
even to Ganow and his family themselves.
He had a smart wife and two bright children,
and it seemed strange a man like him would expose
them thus, in such a remote and dangerous locality.
From this we strayed to other topics, and talked far into
the night, as was often our wont on this trip       the stars
were so brilliant, and the night-air so inviting. Near
midnight, while T. was spinning one of his longest yarns,
and I was lazily listening       on my back, with my hands
under my head, and knees at an angle       suddenly an Indian,
half naked, loomed up just at our feet, with
bow and arrows in hand, and a revolver at his waist.
To seize my Spencer was the work of an instant, and
the next I demanded:

[Pg 352]

"Who's there? What do you want this time of
night?"

T. stopped talking, and quickly fished up his revolver
from the hay, not seeing the Red Skin till after I challenged
him. Back jumped the Indian, exclaiming excitedly:

"Ugh! No shoot! Me friend! Me Charley!"

"Well, what are you doing here at this hour? What
do you want now?"

"Me been down to Indian Wells. 'Tother fellow
got him knife and dollar. Good! Dieganos much friend
to Gen-e-ral. Heap!"

"Well, then, Charley, why don't you go home, with
the others? What are you loafing here for?"

"Me been playin' cards, till now! Charley gamble a
heap! Mucho! O mui mucho! Lost all. Coat, hat, shirt,
all gone. Me beggar now; got nothing. Charley want
Gen-er-al and fat friend (T. was a little stout) give him
one dollar. Win um all back, quick! Heap more!"

We pitied the poor fellow, but bade him leave till
morning. He still lingered, reluctant to go, but presently
walked slowly off muttering to himself, and we
both became uneasy, as we knew there were a hundred
savages close within his call. However, after lying
awhile undisturbed, we concluded there was no use borrowing
trouble, and T. agreed to keep watch, if I would
try to sleep. Once or twice he woke me up with a "hist,"
and we fancied we heard the stealthy tread of Red
Skins about us; but none molested us, and morning
broke at last much to our relief. We breakfasted and
were off too early for Indian habits, so that Charley missed
his "dollar," after all; but we left him a plentiful supply
of matches and "smoke-tobacco," which doubtless served
him far better. This experience, altogether, was rather[Pg 353]
exciting at the time; and it is not too much to say, that
our friend Charley just escaped getting a bullet or two
through him.

As to travel, we met but little, and this was chiefly
Mexicans en route to California. At Carissa Creek, as
we drove up, we found quite a party of these, resting
there during the heat of the day. The men were lounging
about the station, or sleeping in the sand; the
women, washing clothes in the little creek. Their animals       a
heterogeneous herd of horses, mules, and bronchos,       were
browsing by the roadside, on chemisal, mescal,
or whatever they could pick up. The entire party
consisted of imperialists, who were now fleeing from the
vengeance of the just triumphant liberals in Sonora.
When Maximilian first came, the liberals had to leave;
but now Juarez was in the ascendant, and the imperialists
had Hobson's choice of emigration or the halter.
Our host there said, that in the past four months about
twelve hundred imperialists had passed California-ward,
while during the same period only about two hundred
liberals had returned Sonora-ward; so that California
seemed to be the gainer, by this exodus. We essayed
some talk with the party, in our hobbling Spanish, which
daily improved, and one who seemed to be the leader
responded, as follows:

"Si, Senor! Imperialists we, all; Maximiliani!
Sonora no good place for imperialists now, Jesu, no!
Liberals just take one knife, this way (and he drew his
hand significantly across his throat); or one lariat, this
way (and he twirled his fingers around his head); or else,
one carabina       bang! Carahu! We vamose to California!"

He said this, with such wild grimaces and mad gesticulations,
as only a Mexican can achieve; and presently,[Pg 354]
to our delight, the whole banditti cut-throat looking
crew moved off, with a friendly chorus of "Adios!
Senors! Adios!"

The few Americans we met en route       but a handful       all
reported themselves as going "inside," and smiled
at us bound "outside." By inside, of course, they
meant California and civilization; by outside, Arizona
and something else! Of all the Borderisms we had
heard yet, these seemed the strangest, until we got well
"outside" ourselves, and thoroughly comprehended
them; and then they appeared the aptest, indeed, of any.
How much so, this chapter suggests in part already;
and others will further disclose, when we get well into
Arizona. "Inside" and paradise, "outside" and purgatory       these
were the opposing ideas constantly expressed,
and we learned not to wonder at them.



[Pg 355]




CHAPTER XXII.

FORT YUMA TO TUCSON.


Fort Yuma is popularly believed to be in Arizona,
but is in reality in the extreme southeastern corner
of California. The fort itself stands on a high bluff, on
the west bank of the Rio Colorado, which alone separates
it from Arizona, and is usually occupied by two or three
companies of U. S. troops. Directly opposite, on the
east bank of the Colorado, stands Arizona City, a
straggling collection of adobe houses, containing then
perhaps five hundred inhabitants all told. Here and at
Yuma are located the government store-houses, shops,
corrals, etc., as the grand depot for all the posts in
Arizona. Hence, considerable business centres here;
but it is chiefly of a military nature, and if the post and
depot were removed, the "City" as such would speedily
subside into its original sand-hills. Being at the junction
of the Gila and Colorado, where the main route of travel
east and west crosses the latter, it is also the first place
of any importance on the Colorado itself; and hence
would seem to be well located for business, if Arizona
had any business to speak of. The distance to the
mouth of the Colorado is one hundred and fifty miles,
whence a line of schooners then connected with San
Francisco two thousand miles away via the Gulf of
California. From the head of the Gulf, light-draught
stern-wheel steamers ascend the Colorado to Yuma, and[Pg 356]
occasionally to La Paz, and Fort Mojave or Hardyville       one
hundred and fifty, and three hundred miles, farther
up respectively. Sometimes they had even reached Callville,
some six hundred miles from the Gulf, but this
was chiefly by way of adventure, as there was no population
or business sufficient to justify such risks ordinarily.

The Rio Colorado itself, or the great Red River of the
west, although rising even beyond Fort Bridger, in the
very heart of the continent, and draining with its
tributaries the whole western slope of the Rocky Mountains
for two thousand miles, was yet pronounced an
unnavigable stream, after the first few hundred miles,
and rather a hard river to navigate even that distance.
Much of the way it runs through a comparatively rainless
region in summer, and the last few hundred miles it
ploughs its course along through a sandy alluvium, where
its channel is constantly shifting, and sand-bars everywhere
prevail. The tiny river-steamers reported the
channel never in the same place for a week together,
and they always tied up when night came, for fear of
running ashore or grounding in the darkness. The
current, moreover, was usually very swift; so that
between the sand and water together, voyaging on the
Colorado was regarded generally as a slow kind of business.
These boats usually took from three days to a
week, to make the one hundred and fifty miles, from the
mouth of the river to Arizona City, and from ten to
twenty days more to ascend to Hardyville       three hundred
miles farther       whence, however, they descended
to the Gulf again, with water and sand both to help
them, in a tithe of the time. In all, there were three
boats then on the Colorado, supported chiefly by a
contract they had to transport government stores. Without
this, there was not enough travel or freight, apparently,[Pg 357]
to keep even one running, though it was hoped
the development of mines in Arizona would soon make
business more brisk.

As a means of a water communication, from the Gulf
of California into the very heart of the continent, it would
seem, that this great river ought to have become more
useful to civilization, than it has. But the difficulties
of navigating it, even to Callville, were reported great;
and beyond that, was the insuperable obstacle of the
Big Cañon of the Colorado, which nobody then knew
anything about, except as a geographical mystery, but
which Prof. Powell has since explored so gallantly. At
Yuma, the river was a turbid, rolling flood, broad and
deep; and, judging by what we saw of it there, it would
seem, that steamers of proper draught and build ought
to be able to stem its current, and be of great service
hereafter to all the upper country. The rates then current
on the river were as follows: From the mouth of
the Colorado to Yuma or Arizona City, 150 miles, twenty dollars
per ton, coin; to La Paz, 300 miles, forty dollars
per ton; to Fort Mojave or Hardyville, 450 miles, sixty
dollars per ton. The rates from San Francisco to the
mouth of the river, some 2000 miles, were then from
twelve to fifteen dollars per ton, coin, besides; so that
every load of freight put down at Arizona City or
Hardyville, cost say thirty-five dollars and seventy-five
dollars per ton, coin, respectively, for transportation
alone. This may have been good business for the transportation
companies; but it was death to mining, and
other private enterprises, and operated practically as a
prohibition to business, over most of the country there.
It made Arizona substantially inaccessible, to population
and trade, by this route (and there was no other so
advantageous), and the whole country was hoping against[Pg 358]
hope, with prayers without ceasing, for a sometime oncoming
railroad.

March 2d, while still at Arizona City, inspecting the
depot there, we saw something of a Yuma sand-storm.
The whirlwinds we had observed in the distance, when
crossing the Colorado Desert a day or two before, seemed
to have been only its precursors. It struck Yuma on
the 2d, and promised to be only a passing blow, lulling
away at eventide; but on the 3d, it resumed its course,
with increased violence, and all day long rolled and
roared onward furiously. We had heard much of these
Yuma sand-storms, and on the whole were rather glad
to see one, disagreeable as it proved. The morning
dawned, hot and sultry, without a breath of air anywhere.
Along about 9 a. m., the wind commenced
sweeping in from the Desert, and as it increased in power
uplifted and whirled along vast masses of sand, that
seemed to trail as curtains of tawny gossamer from the
very sky. As yet, it was comparatively clear at Yuma,
and we could see the sweep and whirl of the storm off
on the Desert, as distinctly as the outlines of a distant
summer shower. But, subsequently, the Desert itself
seemed to be literally upborne, and sweeping in, on the
wings of the wind. The heavens became lurid and
threatening. The sun disappeared, as in a coppery fog.
The landscape took on a yellowish, fiery glare. The
atmosphere became suffocating and oppressive. Towards
noon, the wind rose to a hurricane; the sand, if possible,
came thicker and faster, penetrating into every nook and
cranny; the air became absolutely stifling, until neither
man nor beast could endure it passably. People kept
within doors, with every window closed, and animals
huddled in groups with their noses to the ground, as if
the only place to breathe. As night approached, the[Pg 359]
tempest gradually ceased, as if it had blown itself out;
but it followed us on a minor scale, for a day or two
afterwards, as we journeyed up the Gila. The ill-defined
horror, and actual suffering of such a day, must be experienced
to be appreciated. Out on the Desert, in the midst
of the storm, the phenomenon no doubt would amount
much to the same thing as the simooms of the Sahara.
Travellers or troops caught in these sand-storms have to
stop still, and instances are not rare where persons have
lost their lives, in attempting to battle with them. They
obliterate all signs of a road, where they actively prevail,
whirling the sand into heaps and ridges, like New England
snow-drifts; and the next travellers, who chance
along, have either to go by the compass, or employ a
guide, who understands the lay of the mountains, and
country generally. Col. Crittenden, of the 32d Infantry,
who crossed the Desert with a portion of his command
some time after, was detained two days by such a storm,
and his men suffered greatly, especially for want of water.

These sand-storms, it appears, are pretty much the
only storms they ever get at Yuma, and they would not be
unwilling there to dispense with even these. In the spring
and summer, they frequently prevail there, sweeping in
from the south and southwest, and it is not too much
to say, that they are simply execrable. They have done
much to make the name of Fort Yuma proverbial on the
Pacific Coast, as the hottest place in the Union; and in
San Francisco there was a story current about a soldier,
who died at Yuma in a customary spree, and of course
went to tophet. Subsequently, however, the story ran,
his ghost came back for his blankets, because as alleged
he had found the climate there much colder than Yuma       a
sort of Alaska to California! The Post stands on a
high gravel bluff, facing to the east and south, exposed to[Pg 360]
the blazing sun throughout the day; and, consequently,
becoming saturated through and through with heat,
retains it for months together. Hence, in the summer
months, for weeks together, the thermometer there ranges
from 100° to 125° in the shade, and the chief end of the
garrison becomes an effort to keep cool, or even tolerably
so. A tour of duty there was commonly regarded on the
Coast, as a kind of banishment to Botany Bay; and yet
we found the officers a very clever set of gentlemen, and
spent some days there quite delightfully. Col. W., the
commandant, proved to be an old acquaintance of the
Army of the Potomac; and Dr. J., the surgeon, an old
school-mate.

The Post here was established about 1857 to overawe
the Yumas, then a stalwart and numerous tribe of Indians,
occupying both banks of the Colorado for a hundred
miles or more. Though much reduced, they still numbered
over a thousand souls; and physically speaking, were
the finest specimens of aborigines we had seen yet.
They cultivate the river-bottoms to some extent, and
raise barley, wheat, beans, melons, etc.       for their surplus
of which, when any, they find a ready market at Fort
Yuma and Arizona City. Some chop wood for the
river-steamers, and others indeed we found employed
on the steamers themselves, as deck-hands, firemen, etc.
Altogether, these Yumas seemed to have more of the
practical about them, than any savages we had met yet,
and no doubt they might be saved to the race for generations
to come, were proper efforts made to protect and
care for them. They had been peaceable for years, and
scores of them thronged the Post and the depot, every
day we were there. The men wore only a breech-cloth,
with long ends fluttering fore and aft; the women but
little more, though some of them affected a rude[Pg 361]
petticoat. Both sexes, as a rule, were naked from the
waist up, and many of each were superb specimens of
humanity; but all seemed corrupted and depraved,
by contact with the nobler white race. The open
and unblushing looseness and licentiousness of the
riff-raff of Arizona City, with these poor Indians, was
simply disgusting, and it is a disgrace to a Christian
government to tolerate such orgies, as frequently occur
there, under the very shadow of its flag. Great blame
attaches to the army, in former years, for ever admitting
these poor creatures within the precincts of the Post
there at all. Some time before, it was said, the commanding
officer sent for Pasquol, their head-chief, and
bade him order his squaws away.

"My squaws?" he indignantly responded; "no my
squaws now! White man's squaws! Before white man
come, squaws good       stay in wigwam       cook       fish       work
in field       gather barley       heap good. But now squaws
about Fort all day       City all night       and Yumas no want
'em. White man made squaws a heap bad. White
man keep 'em!"

And with this, old Pasquol, a stately old savage,
wrapped his blanket about his shoulders, and strode
haughtily away. As far as we could learn, there had
never been a missionary, or teacher of any kind, among
these poor Yumas; and to all who feel a call in that
direction, we would suggest the place as a superb field,
for earnest missionary work. Will not some of our
religious organizations, now that they have got the Red
Man so fully in their hands, make a note of this, and try
to look a little after these splendid savages, degraded
though they be, as well as the Cheyennes and Sioux, and
other more eastern tribes?

At Fort Yuma we overhauled Gov. McCormick and[Pg 362]
wife, who had left San Francisco in advance of us, and
who were now about to leave for Prescott, then the capital
of Arizona. On reflection, however, rather than lose
such good company, they decided to journey with us to
Tucson, and thence somewhat back to Prescott; whence
we designed returning to Los Angelos again, via Fort
Mojave. Accordingly, we left Arizona City, March 4th,
our route lying up the Gila easterly two hundred miles
to Maricopa Wells, and thence southerly one hundred
miles to Tucson, the oldest and most considerable town
in the Territory, and now again the capital. Much as
we had "roughed it," while en route from Wilmington
to Fort Yuma, according to all reports we would have
to rough it much worse before reaching Tucson, if we
trusted to the wayside ranches; and, therefore, before
setting out, we secured a joint cook, and provided ourselves
with a tolerable larder. Our "outfit" consisted
of two four-mule ambulances, into which and outside we
stowed and strapped ourselves, baggage, rations, forage,
cooking utensils, etc., as best we could. Expecting to
"camp-out" at night, we also took along two extra
wagon-sheets, to pitch as tents, if necessary; but never
found occasion to use them, except as beds, beneath those
exquisite skies. There was no cavalry then at Yuma, and
the road as far as Maricopa Wells being reported comparatively
safe, we decided to proceed thither without
escort, depending upon our own courage and vigilance.
Nevertheless, we took the precaution before starting to
arm our cook and both drivers with Springfield muskets,
while we ourselves were equipped with a Spencer or
Remington rifle apiece, as well as our revolvers.

With a host of "adios" and "good-byes," from our
Yuma friends, we swung out of Arizona City late that
morning, through sand knee-deep, and thus were fairly[Pg 363]
off for Tucson. The roads proved heavy all that day,
and the remains of the sand-storm kept us company; yet
we succeeded in making thirty-one miles, and went into
camp before night-fall on the banks of the Gila. Some
twenty miles out we passed Gila City, consisting of two
adobe huts and an abandoned mine, then famous as
the spot where Gen. McD., and some San Francisco
friends, had recently made rather "permanent investments."
Thence on to Maricopa Wells, indeed all
the way from Arizona City, the road ascends the south
bank of the Gila, and confines itself pretty closely
to it, except here and there where it strikes across
the mesas, to avoid some bend in this most tortuous of
streams. The Gila itself ordinarily is an insignificant
river, apparently famed more for quicksands than water;
but just now its banks were full with the spring freshet,
and its usual fords dangerous if not impassable. Its
valley is of uncertain breadth, from one to five miles,
though its river bottoms       its only really valuable land       are
of course much narrower. Beyond the valley, on
either side, are high mesas or plateaus, covered often with
barren volcanic rocks, like the table-lands of Idaho; and,
beyond these still, are substantial mountain-ranges. The
range on the north, day after day, was a constant wonder
and delight. Instead of ridges and peaks, it seemed to
be rather a succession of domes, and towers, and castellated
ramparts, sharp and well-defined against a peerless
sky, chief among which was Castle Dome       a superb
dome-like mountain, that dominated the landscape for
two or three days together. These dome-shaped mountains
are a feature of Arizona, and abound everywhere
in the Territory, especially in the northern part of it.

As already intimated, we found the Gila very high
and still rising. In several places, it had just washed the[Pg 364]
banks away, destroying the road, and we had to pick our
way across the bottoms, through the chemisal and mesquite,
to the connecting part, the best we could. In this
way, it seems, its channel is constantly shifting, and this
was said to be one of the chief drawbacks to constructing
acequias, and cultivating its fine bottom lands by
irrigation. The head of an acequia to-day, tapping the
river well, a month hence may be three feet or more out
of water, and then all the work of excavating ditches,
damming the river, etc., has to be done over again. The
bed of the Gila itself, in the main, seems to be pure
quicksand. At one point, a station-keeper showed us
where a year before piles had been driven down fifty
feet, in making a wing-dam to divert a portion of the
river into an acequia; but at the first freshet, the cross
currents had underbored everything, and left the head of
the acequia high and dry. No doubt the river-bottoms
are all exceedingly fertile, and would produce well, if
irrigated; but not otherwise. Of these, there is a considerable
breadth, at many points along the Gila, and,
here and there, there had been some attempts at cultivation,
but scarcely any worth mentioning.

These bottoms nearly everywhere abound with bunch-grass
and mesquite-timber       the one the delight of horses
and cattle, the other invaluable in that treeless region.
The mesquite has but little height; but its trunk is often
two and three feet in diameter, though only about as many
high, from which point it throws out great, sturdy, black,
gnarled limbs for a distance of thirty or forty feet all
around. We saw many of them, that I think could not
have been more than five or six feet in height, the bend
of the branches included; nevertheless, with their
crooked and gnarled limbs, they sprawled over the
ground for a diameter of fully seventy-five or one hundred[Pg 365]
feet. At first they strike you as dwarfs, puny in
aspect and purpose; but afterwards, as stunted giants,
massive in strength and power, writhing in very anguish,
because unable to tower higher. For lumber purposes,
the mesquite amounts to but little; but for fuel, it is
invaluable, and the future settlers on the Gila will prize
it highly. It occurs pretty much all through Arizona,
on the best river-bottoms, and everywhere seems a providential
institution. It makes a fire-wood scarcely inferior
to oak or hickory, and bears a bean besides, which
constitutes a large part of the subsistence of the Mexicans
and the Indians there. These mesquite beans make
a very sweet and palatable dish, and horses, mules, cattle,
etc. are especially fond of them. The Mexicans we
met en route to California, were subsisting upon them
almost entirely, and subsequently in wandering through
a Pimo village, we found them in every storehouse. A
Pimo belle, for a bundle of cigarritos, cooked us a
dish of them, and we have eaten worse things in New
York and Washington. Said an old Arizonian one day,
"Wherever you see mesquites, strangers, look out for
good land, you bet!" and we found it so invariably.
Indeed, with a moderate amount of enterprise, and a
small amount of capital, we saw no good reason why the
valley of the Gila should not eventually be dotted with
excellent farms. The land is all there, and plenty of water
to irrigate it (if only the Gila can be subdued, and surely
it can), and the climate the year round must be delicious.
But, as a rule, we found the country desolate and forsaken,
with the exception of a starving ranch here
and there, whose dirty and dilapidated proprietor cared
more to swear at his snarling half-cayote dogs, and sell
an occasional glass of mescal or whiskey, than to do an
honest hard day's work. The truth is, the most of these[Pg 366]
settlers, as well as too many throughout Arizona generally,
were exiles or emigrants from Arkansas and Texas,
with little in them of the kind of stuff that founds states
and builds empires. They knew how to drink, and swear,
and "shoot a Red Skin, sir, on sight;" but were strangers
to honest toil and steady industry, and therefore missed
their logical and golden fruits       prosperity and thrift. Of
course, like all such everywhere, they were opposed to
"Chinese cheap labor;" and, like the good William
Nye, hated the "Heathen Chinee," even worse than
the negro.

At Gila Bend, some fifty miles from Maricopa Wells,
the river makes a sharp curve north, and the road leaves
it, for a direct course across the Bend to Maricopa Wells.
This embraces what is known mainly as the Maricopa
Desert       a wide circuit of level country, practically a
waterless desert, though with some good land here and
there. In wet seasons and during rainy months, water
remains in a few holes near the middle of the Desert;
but we found all long since dry. The distance is usually
made in two stages, water being carried along for drinking
and cooking purposes; but our "outfit" was light,
and taking an early start and driving late, we pushed
through in one. The Desert itself, as level as a house-floor,
is covered with a sort of fine gravel, that makes
an excellent road, over which our wheels rolled easily.
Near its eastern borders, a range of barren mountains
crosses the Desert from north to south, apparently blocking
the way; but the road climbs along through a narrow
cañon, that opens as you approach, and makes the plains
beyond very readily. This cañon is a noted resort of
the dread Apaches, and several attacks had recently
occurred here. Before leaving Fort Yuma we had been
told we would find hostile Indians here, if anywhere. But[Pg 367]
we took the precaution to dismount from our ambulances,
and skirmish through on foot; and consequently, Señors
Apaches failed to show themselves, if there. Our experience
was the same all the way to Tucson. Subsequently,
while en route thither, we passed several other places,
where we had been warned to look out for Apaches, especially
at Picacho, where the mountains crowd down to the
road, and form something like a cañon again. But a
prudent vigilance by day, and a few simple precautions by
night, carried us safely through; and we were more than
ever convinced, that the great majority of Indian attacks
come from carelessness and neglect, on the part of the
attacked.

A few miles west of Gila Bend, between Berk's
Station and Oatman's Flat, we passed a group of rocks,
that interest everybody, but which nobody seemed to
know much about. They stand near the roadside, and
consist of smooth red porphyry, or some such stone,
curiously carved with figures of men, birds, beasts, fishes,
etc. Many of the figures are now quite indistinct, but
sufficient remain to show what they were, and their very
indistinctness       coupled with the hardness of the stone       proves
their great antiquity. The rocks themselves,
when struck, ring like genuine clink-stones; and, it would
seem, only the sharpest and hardest instruments could
make much impression on them. The place is called
"Painted Rocks," and we had only time for a cursory
examination; but the sculpturing seemed too remote for
Spanish times, and was generally attributed to the days
of the Aztecs. However this may be, they appeared to
be there as a species of hieroglyphics, and doubtless
have a story to tell, that some future Champollion may
unfold. It may be, that the ancient travel for Mexico
left the Gila here, or about here, and struck across the[Pg 368]
country for the Santa Cruz and so south, flanking the
Maricopa Desert, and that these sculptured rocks record
the place as the starting-point       as a sort of finger-board
or mile-stone. This is only a conjecture; but here, at
least, is work for the archæologist and antiquarian, as
well as at so many other points in Arizona.

With the exception of some mesquite, iron-wood,
and palo-verde trees, scattered here and there along the
Gila and its bottoms, the whole country from Yuma to
Tucson is practically treeless, and must continue so from
want of rains. Sage-brush and grease-wood abound, as
in Utah and Idaho, and throughout the great internal
basin of the continent generally; and on the uplands,
you find the great columnar cactus in full vigor and
maturity. Indeed, from the time we struck the Colorado
Desert, we were fairly into the cactus region of the
continent, but the varieties were few, and the size
moderate, till we got well into Arizona. Here they
increased in height and bulk, until we reached the Maricopa
Desert, where we found them thirty and forty feet
high, by two or three feet in diameter, with perpendicular
branches halfway up, nearly half as large as the main
stem. This variety is a green fluted column, with its
edges armed with semi-circular thorns, and bears a cluster
of apples on top, from which the Indians extract a rude
molasses or sugar. Inside, it is a frame-work of reedy
poles, that serve many useful purposes in that woodless
region. These immense cacti dot the country over to
Tucson, and beyond       indeed, down to Mexico, and largely
through it       and are a leading feature of southern
Arizona. Sometimes you miss them altogether; but, as
a rule, they occur more or less on the mesas or plateaus
nearly everywhere, and seem in the distance like monumental
columns. Their clustering groups and varying[Pg 369]
heights, when seen from afar, have all the effect of a
rural cemetery; only here the shafts are emerald green,
instead of marble white. In fights with the Indians,
they often prove of value as a defence, and their huge
trunks secrete a fluid much akin to water, that has saved
the life of many a thirsty traveller, when lost amid these
arid wastes. How such a gigantic vegetable or immense
plant can thus nourish here, where nothing else comparatively
will grow, is a continuing mystery and perpetual
astonishment. It would seem more fit for a luxuriant
soil and a tropical climate. Yet here it is, magnum opus,
mocking the naturalist apparently to scorn.

At Maricopa Wells, and thence up the Gila, we found
a large settlement of the Maricopa and Pimo Indians.
The Maricopas, it seems, are an offshoot of the Yumas,
and number less than a thousand souls. The Pimos foot
up five or six thousand, and from them are sprung the
Papagos       a great tribe dominating all southern Arizona.
The Maricopas and Pimos have a Reservation here
together, some twenty-five miles long by four or five wide,
embracing both sides of the Gila, and live in twelve different
villages scattered over it. Two of these are occupied
wholly by Maricopas       the rest, by Pimos. Both
tribes are a healthy, athletic, vigorous-looking people,
and they were decidedly the most well-to-do aborigines
we had yet seen. Unlike most Indians elsewhere, these
two tribes are steadily on the increase; and this is
not to be wondered at, when one sees how they have
abandoned a vagabond condition, and settled down to
regular farming and grazing. They have constructed
great acequias up and down the Gila, and by means of
these take out and carry water for irrigating purposes,
over thousands of acres of as fine land as anybody
owns. Their fields were well fenced with willows, they[Pg 370]
had been scratched a little with rude plows, and already
(March 9th) they were green with the fast springing
wheat and barley. In addition, they raise corn, beans,
melons, etc., and have horses and cattle in considerable
numbers. One drove of their live stock, over two thousand
head, passed down the road just ahead of us, subsequently
when en route to Tucson, and we were told they
had many more. The year before, these Indians had
raised and sold a surplus of wheat and corn, amounting
to two millions of pounds, besides a large surplus of barley,
beans, etc. The most of this was bought by Indian
traders, located at Maricopa Wells and Pimo villages, at
from one to two cents per pound, coin, in trade; and then
resold to the government, for the use of troops in Arizona,
at from six to seven cents per pound, coin, in cash. This
is a specimen of the way in which the old Indian Ring
fleeced both the Indians and the government, and I give it
as a passing argument in favor of the new policy. These
Indians, it appears, have practiced agriculture somewhat
from time immemorial, and they should be encouraged
in it, as there is no surer way of "pacifying" or civilizing
them. During the rebellion, they furnished two companies
to the Union volunteers in Arizona, and the most
of these had just re-enlisted, to serve as scouts against the
Apaches. These wore a mongrel uniform, half Indian,
half soldier; but the rest, only the traditional breech-cloth.

Their wigwams are oval-shaped, wicker-work lodges,
made of poles, thatched with willows and straw, and this
in turn overlaid with earth. An inverted wash-bowl,
on an exaggerated scale, would not be a bad representation
of one of them. They are usually five or six feet
high in the centre, by fifteen or twenty in diameter, and
would be very comfortable dwellings, were it not for[Pg 371]
their absurd doors. These are only about thirty inches
high, by perhaps twenty wide, and consequently the only
mode of entrance is on your hands and knees. While
halting at the Pimo villages for a day, we managed to
crawl into one, for the sake of the experience; but the
smoke and the dirt soon drove us out. There was a dull
fire in the centre, but with no means of exit for the smoke,
except the low doorway. Rush or willow mats covered
the rest of the floor, and on these three or four Pimos
lay snoozing, wrapped in hides and blankets. Various
articles of rude pottery, made by themselves, were
stowed away under the eaves of the roof; and at the
farther side, suspended from a roof-pole in a primitive
cradle, was a pretty papoose sound asleep. As we
crawled in, the venerable head of the family, raising himself
on his elbow, saluted us with:

"Ugh! White man?"

To which, we, in true Arizona dialect, responded:

"How! Buenos dias, Señor!"

His dignified and elegant answer was:

"Heap good! 'Bacco? Matches?"

We gave him some of each, and shook hands all
round, when the aged aborigine was pleased to add:

"Pimos! Americanos! Much friends! Mui Mucho!"

These Indians had long been quiet and peaceable,
and it would seem are already on the road to civilization.
What they need is school-houses and religious teachers.
They had an Agent, an ex-officer of volunteers,
who seemed honest and capable. But his hands were
tied, as to many essential things, and as a rule he was
powerless for good. The Indian Bureau, with its then
accustomed wisdom, continued to send him fishing-lines
and fish-hooks, although there was not a palatable fish in
the Gila       I suppose, because the Indians formerly on the[Pg 372]
Ohio and the Mississippi needed these; but persistently
refused him carts and wagons, although these were constantly
called for, to enable them to haul their crops and
fuel. As it was, we found the poor squaws gathering
their scanty fuel as best they could       often miles away       and
lugging it home to their villages, on their backs and
heads, from far and near. A single cart or wagon to a
village would be invaluable to these poor creatures, and
would do more to ameliorate their condition, than a car-load
of fish-hooks, or a cargo of trinkets and blankets.
Religiously, their ideas seemed confused and vague,
except that they believed, in a general way, in some sort
of a supreme being, whom they call Montezuma. On
the mountains to the west of them, clear-cut against
their azure sky, is a gigantic human profile, which they
claim is Montezuma asleep. It bears, indeed, a striking
resemblance to our own Washington, and is a marked
feature of the landscape for many miles.

Thence on to Tucson, nearly a hundred miles south,
we found the country much the same as up the Gila, and
across the Maricopa Desert. There was a great want of
water everywhere, and often we would travel for twenty
and thirty miles, before we came to a stream or spring.
Our road was almost a dead level, generally free from
sand, along which our teams trotted gaily, and it really
seemed, as if specially designed for a natural highway here
forever. A railroad could want no better route; and here
is surely the predestined pathway of our future Arizona
Southern, or some such road, into Sonora. Of population
there was even less than on the Gila, until we struck the
Santa Cruz near Tucson, when ranches again thickened
up, and flocks and herds on a moderate scale were not
infrequent. The chief characteristic of the country
everywhere was the columnar cactus, the gigantic species[Pg 373]
spoken of on page 368. The farther we got south, the
larger it grew and the more it branched out, until it
became indeed quite a tree, after a clumsy sort. Sage-brush
and grease-wood, of course, constantly occurred,
and here and there superb bunch-grass abounded, which
will prove invaluable hereafter for grazing purposes, when
the country settles up. The mountains usually gave us a
wide berth; occasionally, however, they crowded quite
down to the road, as at Picacho and Point of Mountains,
and as we neared Tucson they shot up into a bold,
castellated front off to the east, that would be very surprising
outside of Arizona. Here, however, such dome-like
peaks, and castellated walls, are frequent features
of the scenery.

The weather proved delicious all the way down, and
our ride throughout a delightful one. We heard of
Apaches at one or two points, but it was always a fortnight
before or several miles ahead, and we went
through unmolested. Before leaving Maricopa Wells,
we were warned of Apaches en route, and as a prudent
precaution accepted an escort of three infantry-men,
whom we mounted on our ambulances       there being no
cavalry on hand. These stood guard in turn at night,
and were vigilant by day. But we saw no enemy, and
their only service was to arrest an insubordinate and
drunken teamster, who afterwards escaped from them, but
the next morning returned and resumed his mules. He
was a queer genius, indigenous to the Border; but, subsequently,
proved himself a brave and gallant fellow       one
of the best teamsters I ever knew.



[Pg 374]




CHAPTER XXIII.

TUCSON TO PRESCOTT.


Tucson we found to be a sleepy old town, of a
thousand or so inhabitants, that appeared to be
trying its best to take things easy, and succeeds in
doing so. It was formerly, and is now again, the capital
of Arizona, and the largest town in the territory. It is
reputed to be some two hundred years old, and its
appearance certainly justifies its reputation. It sort of
half awoke from its lethargy one day, when news arrived
that our party were en route, at Point of the Mountains,
and would reach Tucson next morning. Arrangements
were hastily made to organize a procession, and give
their distinguished visitors a grand reception, with music,
speeches, etc. No doubt it would have been a curious
performance, all things considered. But while its projectors
were agitating, and discussing, and deciding
what hour to start, lo! our dusty and jaded teams trotted
into town, and Tucson missed one of its biggest sensations.
No doubt the honorable Committee and their
selected orator were much put out; but others, it is
certain, secretly rejoiced.

The town itself is built wholly of adobe, in thorough
Mexican or Spanish style, and its population fluctuated.
During the rule of Maximilian in Mexico, there was a
considerable influx of Liberals here from Sonora, so
that the town at one time numbered perhaps fifteen[Pg 375]
hundred souls. But with his "taking off," and the rise
again of Juarez, many had returned thither; so that the
population was then only about a thousand or so, as
above stated, of whom fully two-thirds or more were
Mexicans, originally or by descent. Its streets are unpaved,
and all slope to the middle as a common sewer,
as in Spain. It boasted several saloons, one rather
imposing, and some good stores; but had no bank, newspaper,
school-house, or church, except a rude adobe
structure, where a Mexican padre officiated on Sunday
to a small audience, with much array of lights, images,
drums and violins, and afterwards presided at the customary
cock-fight. As specimens of ruling prices, grain
(barley and wheat) sold at $3 per bushel, hay at $40 per
ton, lumber at $250 per thousand, all coin, and other
things in proportion. The lumber came from the
Santa Rita Mountains, fifty miles away, and was poor
and scarce at that.

The basis of Tucson's existence, it appears, is the
little Santa Cruz river, which flows along just at the
edge of the town, and irrigates some hundreds of surrounding
acres, green just then (March 13th-18th),
with wheat, barley, oats, etc. There is a good breadth
of fine land here, and near here, and the river ought
to be made to irrigate the whole valley. No doubt
with proper husbanding and utilizing of the little
stream, thousands of acres might be cultivated, and
the whole region, both above and below Tucson, be
made to produce largely. Peach-trees were in bloom
down by the river side when we were there; the grape,
the orange, and the olive appeared in many gardens;
and both climate and soil seemed all the most fastidious
could wish. But Tucson lacks energy and capital, and
besides, it seemed, the Apaches claim original, and pretty[Pg 376]
much undisputed, jurisdiction over most of the country
there. Merchants complained that the Apaches raided
on their teams and trains en route, and ranchmen that
the wily rascals levied contributions regularly on their
live stock, as soon as it was worth anything, and did not
hesitate to scalp and kill, as well as steal, if it came in
their way. Farming or grazing under such circumstances,
it must be conceded, could hardly be called
very lucrative or enticing, and the Tucsonians are entitled
to the benefit of this explanation.

The livest and most energetic things, however, that we
saw about Tucson were its innumerable blackbirds, that
thronged the few trees about the streets, and awoke us
every morning with their multitudinous twittering and
chattering. How those birds did chatter and sing, from
daylight well on into the morning; and what a relief they
were to the dull and prosy old town! The men and
women, wrapped in their serapes or blankets, sunned
themselves by the hour in the doorways. The dogs and
cats, the goats and pigs, slept on in the streets, or
strolled lazily about at will. But these plucky birds
sung on and on, with all the heartiness and abandon of
the robin or mocking-bird in the East; and Tucson should
emulate their intrepidity, and zeal. She should shake
off somewhat of the spirit of Rip Van Winkle, and
remember she is under Yankee Government now, and in
the latter half of the nineteenth century.

Tucson already drove a considerable trade with
Sonora, and expected to increase this much, now that
Maximilian had subsided. Its main importance, however,
just then, arose from its being the headquarters of
the Military District there, and the chief depot for the
several posts comprising said District. The stores for
Camps Lovell, Cameron, Wallen, Bowie, Goodwin, and[Pg 377]
Grant, were all received here from Fort Yuma by
contractors' trains, and then re-distributed by army teams
to these posts, respectively, as needed. This made considerable
business, first and last, and rendered the
Quartermaster at Tucson quite an important personage.
The route was by sailing-vessels, semi-occasionally, down
the Pacific Coast and up the stormy Gulf of California
to the mouth of the Colorado; thence by cockle-shell
steamers up the aggravating Colorado River to Fort
Yuma; and thence by contractors' teams to Tucson       at
a total cost, from San Francisco, of about twenty cents
per pound, in coin, for every load of Government
freight thus put down at Tucson. The time consumed
was anywhere from two to four months, depending
on the head-winds and "borers"[22] in the uncertain
Gulf, the amount of water or sand in the Colorado
River, and the condition of the roads and Indians
generally up the valley of the Gila. Private freight, of
course, largely followed the same route, ex necessitate,
and the rates were simply ruinous to Tucson. Merchants
and freighters there claimed, that the same work
could be done, via either Libertad or Guaymas, instead
of Yuma, at a cost of not exceeding seven or eight cents
per pound, coin, and in not more than from twenty to
thirty days, from San Francisco, at the farthest. This, of
course, meant steamers from San Francisco to the Gulf;
but a coast-wise line already touched semi-monthly at
Guaymas, and it was thought would also put in at Libertad,
if inducement offered. Libertad lies two hundred miles
off, to the southwest of Tucson, on the Gulf of California,
and is a port not equal to San Francisco or San Diego, indeed;
but yet it is not much behind San Pedro or Santa
Barbara, and it seems is of sufficient advantages most of[Pg 378]
the year round. It is an open roadstead like the latter, but
is well sheltered from all but southwest winds, and when
these come, there is the broad Gulf for an offing. Guaymas,
farther south, and a hundred miles farther away, is
one of the best ports on the Pacific Coast; and the roads
to both are excellent natural highways, unsurpassed as
such in America.

True, both of these ports are in Mexican territory,
which was one of the blunders of our treaty of cession
there; but the Mexican authorities, it was said,
were willing and anxious to have us make use of
them, and now that the Imperialists had left Sonora,
there was no difficulty in traversing the country, except
from occasional Indians. Individuals, it was said,
already travelled everywhere alone there, camping out at
night with safety; and a train of teams, with armed
teamsters, it was believed, would be invincible against
any aborigines, that would be likely to turn up. At
least, this was Tucson's oft-told story, and the burden of
her griefs, when we were there. What she wanted was
to get "inside," or secure access to civilization, cheap
and quick. She had rich copper mines and fair silver
ones, as we ourselves witnessed, only a few miles off;
but these were now all lying idle, because of Apaches,
and the excessive cost and slowness of transportation.
This last item, of course, was the chief one. For cheap
and quick transportation would bring population, stimulate
enterprise, develop the country, re-open her mines,
"pacify" or extirpate the Apaches, and release the
military for duty elsewhere. What she specially wanted,
just then, was to get the Government contractors' teams
to select either the Libertad or Guaymas route, instead
of via Fort Yuma and the Gila       she did not care much,
which. The wagons returning thither would take her[Pg 379]
ores, and surplus grain and wool, down to the coast "and
a market" cheap, rather than go back empty; and thus
solve the problem of her prosperity and growth. Of
course, she looked forward to a transcontinental railroad
in time; but, as yet, this was in the dim future. The
chief object of my trip thither was to look well into
these facts, and they were duly reported to the proper
Department at Washington, for its information and
action. This change of routes, it really seemed, would
result in a saving of at least two hundred thousand dollars,
in coin, to the Government annually; but it may not
have been thought advisable, notwithstanding that, to
trust our line of supplies thus to foreign soil.

South of Tucson, some ten miles, on the road to
Tubac and Mexico, on the banks of the Santa Cruz
still, is the famous church of San Xavier Del Bac, a
venerable relic of the former Spanish rule in Arizona.
The road thither leads through dense mesquite and palo
verde bottoms, with water enough in the Santa Cruz to
irrigate them all; but, as yet, they were unbroken by the
husbandman. The church itself seems to have been
built about a hundred years ago, and, though abandoned,
is still in a good state of preservation. It is not of adobe,
but of large, red, kiln-burnt brick, rough-coated with a
yellowish cement, that seems well-nigh indestructible.
It is cruciform in style, with thick and solid walls, and
its antique front and towers have originally been profusely
decorated with saints, angels, griffins, etc., in niche
or bas-relief, though many of these are now mutilated or
destroyed. Inside it is handsomely frescoed, and was no
doubt once rich in paintings, ornaments, relics, etc., though
these have now mostly disappeared. Its roof seems to be
a sort of asphaltum or concrete, and appears as tight and
firm, as when first laid. In one of the towers, there is[Pg 380]
still a fine chime of bells, that came no doubt originally
from Castile or Arragon. The age of this church is variously
reported, but from a cursory examination it appeared
to have been erected about the year 1797, although we
were shown a mutilated register of marriages, births,
deaths, etc., that began in 1752. This last, however,
seemed to antedate the church, as if it had been in use
by the Spanish settlement here in early times, before
they were able to achieve such an edifice. This church
was no doubt a link in the chain of Spanish Missions,
that the Jesuits a century or more ago established, from
the City of Mexico to Northern California, and was
abandoned like the rest of them, with the subsequent
collapse of their priestly power. No doubt, in its time,
it was the centre of a considerable community there;
but now, only a squalid village of Papago Indians
crouches at its feet, who regard the aged structure with
a superstitious reverence, and will not permit its fine
chime of bells to be removed to Tucson, for fear of Our
Lady's displeasure. The padre at Tucson comes down
and says mass occasionally, and baptizes their young
children; but he cannot cajole them out of their bells,
and doubtless they would fight, rather than lose them.
Altogether, this church is now the best and oldest civilized
structure to be found in Arizona. Very slight
repairs would fit it for occupancy and worship again;
but, unfortunately, there are no inhabitants there now to
occupy and worship in it, except the Papagos aforesaid       and
as specimens of good clean Christians, they don't
amount to much now-a-days, whatever they were once.

From Tucson, we retraced our steps to Maricopa
Wells, reaching there again March 21st, en route to
Prescott; and here had every prospect of being detained
a month or more, by the spring freshets in the Gila and[Pg 381]
Salado. While down at Tucson, there had been heavy
rains, and a great melting of snows, on the mountains to
the east; and the usually sluggish, half-dry rivers were
now all alive, and booming. The Gila, especially, had
overflowed its banks, and its whole valley below in many
places was inundated. Ranch after ranch had been
swept away, and in several instances the scant inhabitants
had barely escaped with their lives, from its treacherous
waters. The fine mesquite bottom at Gila Bend was
reported four feet under water, and Mr. James' house,
corral, etc. there       the finest we saw coming up the Gila       were
all gone. The freshet was said to be the highest
known there for years, and inflicted a loss on the Gila
valley alone, it was alleged, of many thousands of dollars.
The road was submerged or washed out in many
places, and all travel to and from Yuma was interrupted
for weeks, except such as could make its way around
over the hills and mesas, by the old Indian trails. Col.
Crittenden, with a column of three hundred men, en
route to Tucson and Southern Arizona, succeeded in
getting through to Maricopa Wells in fifteen days, though
we had made it in five. He was accompanied by his
wife, a brave lady and true-hearted Kentuckian, who
deserved and received much praise, for the long and
arduous trip she was thus making, rather than separate
from her gallant husband.

These two rivers, the Gila and Salado, lay directly
across our path to Fort Whipple and Prescott, for which
we were now bound       Gov. McCormick and wife to
return to their home there, and T. and I to look
after U. S. post-office and military affairs there generally.
They were both, swollen and turbid; nobody
had forded them, for a month; and they were still
at freshet height, and rising       without bridge or ferry.[Pg 382]
As nothing better could be done, we decided to halt
at Maricopa Wells for a few days, as we could neither
get forward to Prescott nor backward to Yuma, though
the delay was most vexatious at such an out-of-the-world
place, where the mail was so intermittent, and
their freshest newspaper more than a month old. We
spent the time in writing up our note-books, and in studying
the Pimas and Maricopas; but the days wore heavily
on, with small prospect of the waters subsiding. Finally,
after waiting nearly a week, chafing at the delay, we
heard of a little row-boat owned by a German, down at
the McDowell crossing of the Gila, which it was reported
would suffice to ferry us over, if we took our ambulances
well to pieces. We would then have to mount the boat
on a wagon and transport it thirty miles or so, overland
to the Salado, and there repeat the operation; but this
was better, than halting indefinitely at the Wells. We
had been told, there was no boat, available for such a
purpose; but I determined to see what we could do, with
this one. Of course, it would be slow work, and perhaps
dangerous, ferrying over two swollen rivers, by
piecemeal thus. But it seemed better, than being
embargoed and flood-stayed here       practically five hundred
miles away from everywhere       and with no news
from "inside" or civilization, for over a month now.
As to whether we would succeed, we could only say
nous verrons, or quien sabe; but meant to try, anyhow.

Accordingly, early March 25th, we said "adios" to
our good friends at the Wells, and, with many thanks for
their hospitality and kind wishes, drove down to the
Gila, some six miles away. We found it at freshet
height, perhaps a hundred yards wide, by ten or twelve
feet deep, and running like a mill-race       its tawny waters
tossing and whirling, hither and yon, and overflowing its[Pg 383]
thither bank for a long distance. Now and then, as if to
enliven the scene further, a floating mesquite or an uprooted
cottonwood would come rushing by, sweeping all before
it. Altogether, I confess, the Gila was not a very inviting
stream, just then, to navigate. But Louis Heller was
there, with his little boat; Prescott was before, and the
Wells behind us; and we resolved to venture over, if
possible. His boat was a mere cockle-shell affair at best,
a rude canoe, ten feet long by three wide, and clumsy at
that; but Louis, nevertheless, with true German grit and
skill, managed to make it ferry both us and our "outfit"
safely across, in the course of the day. First, went our
baggage and forage, with the Governor and his lady;
then the vehicles, after being taken well to pieces; then,
with much hallooing and shouting, we forced the mules
into the stream, and made them swim for it. Only two
or three got across at first, though the boat led with a
mule swimming behind it, held by a lariat; but these
served as decoys, and the next trip the rest ventured
over. There was a great struggling and whee-haw-ing in
the water for awhile, and now and then a donkey would
whirl over or go under, and some landed far down
stream; nevertheless, we lost none, and soon after we
ourselves got safely across. The little tub of a canoe
tossed and tumbled very shakily, when she got out into the
current, and for a few minutes shot wildly down stream;
but the strong arm of our sturdy Teuton mastered the
wild waters, and at last brought us safely ashore.

It was nightfall, before we got over, and our ambulances
together again. The next morning early, we put
Louis and his boat on a wagon, and started for the
McDowell Crossing of the Salado, some thirty-five miles
away. The Prescott Crossing, several miles below, was
reported impracticable, even with the boat, because of[Pg 384]
the wide overflow of the banks there; but we hoped to
get over at the McDowell Crossing, and then follow
down the north bank of the Salado, until we struck the
Prescott road again. It was late in the afternoon
when we reached the McDowell Crossing, and the
condition of the Salado there was anything but encouraging.
We found it at least three times the size
of the Gila, and with its waters even more swollen and
turbulent. Nevertheless, it was perceptibly falling, and
Louis predicted a much better state of things next morning.
This proved to be true; so, early on the 27th,
we began to ferry over again, as at the Gila. But it
was a tedious and delicate operation. The river, as I
have said, was three or four times as wide, and the
swollen flood so swift, that the boat usually landed a
quarter of a mile or more below where it went in. Then
we had to drag and pole it back along the opposite bank,
half a mile or so above, whence we could row it diagonally
across to the place of starting again.

It took us two days, to cross the Salado thus, and I
need scarcely say, they were long and anxious ones. We
were now in a region infested by Apaches, and we had
to be constantly on the alert to guard against surprise.
Late in the afternoon of the second day, leaving our
teamsters and little escort to get the ambulances together
and repack them, we proceeded up the Salado to Fort
McDowell       the commandant there having heard of our
approach, and sent an ambulance to bring us. It was
some fifteen miles, part of the way through a dreaded
Apache cañon; but we passed safely on, though we did
not reach the post until after nightfall. We found the
post       the largest and finest in Arizona       short of
rations, and wholly out of forage, as it had been for
several weeks, because of the spring freshets, as it was[Pg 385]
alleged, though there was plenty at Maricopa Wells,
which it would seem might have been got there, if we
could. This was suggested to the officer in charge,
and no doubt was well heeded. We remained there
until the next afternoon, inspecting the post and its
bearings (it seemed admirably located for its work,
well into the Apache country, protecting the valley of
the Salado and the Gila), and then returned to our
ambulances at the Crossing. The next morning, by
sunrise, we were up and off, for the Prescott road       if we
could find it. At Fort McDowell, they told us, we could
never reach it. Some said it was thirty miles off       others
claimed it was fifty or sixty, with an impassable country
between. The only thing known definitely was, that
there was no road at all down the north bank of the
Salado, though we were sure to strike the regular Prescott
road, if we kept along down that bank of the river
far enough, and could get through. We might meet
Apaches anywhere, they said, for it was one of their
favorite tramping grounds, or we might go through
unmolested, depending on circumstances. We had
expected to get an escort of a dozen cavalry-men here, to
accompany us to Prescott; but six cavalry-men, and six
mounted infantry-men, were all the post could spare.
The horses of these, though the best on hand, were so
broken down for want of forage, that part were sent back
before we got three miles out; and of the balance, only
five went through to Prescott with us, by extra care and
regular feeding with the grain, which we had taken the
precaution to bring along from Maricopa Wells. An
army wagon, with a six-mule team, also from Fort
McDowell, furnished transportation for our escort, as the
cavalry-horses successively gave out.

For the first fifteen miles or so, after leaving the[Pg 386]
Crossing, we found a well-broken road, used the year
before as a hay-road from the river-bottoms to Fort
McDowell. But, ultimately, this ended in a bend of
the Salado, and from there on all was wild and unbroken       a
veritable terra incognita. We found the
Salado crookeder than a ram's horn, or a mesquite tree,
or anything else that is most crooked and involved.
Laying our course partly by the compass, and partly
by the Salado's fringe of cottonwoods, we struck across
from bend to bend of the river, sure only of one thing,
and that was       keeping near to water. We found the
river bottoms, as a rule, thick with chemisal, relieved
here and there by dense mesquite groves, looking in the
distance like old orchards, through which it was almost
impossible to penetrate with ambulance or wagon. Now
and then we had to flank a slough, or flounder through a
quicksand, and sundown still found us pushing along
through these bottoms, though we had made fully thirty
miles since morning. We went into camp by the riverside
just at dusk, thoroughly worn out, and not without
a degree of anxiety, as we had crossed a number of
Indian trails during the day, though none seemed fresh.
Our animals were well blown, especially the cavalry
horses, and the best we could do for them was a bite of
corn, as we had no hay along, of course, and it was too
late to graze them.

The night passed wearily away, but without cause
for alarm, and early next morning we were again on the
move. A drive, or rather struggle, of three miles or so
through the mesquite and chemisal, brought us out to an
ill-defined track, bearing away in the supposed direction
of Wickenburg (and so to Prescott), and we resolved to
take that, though certain it was not the regular road. We
had heard of a "cut-off," or by-road somewhere there,[Pg 387]
made by a Lt. Du Bois some months before, and we concluded
this must be his road. At all events, we were
desperately tired of struggling through the mesquite and
chemisal, and concluded we would follow this track up
for a while anyhow. It was lucky we did; for, after
rather too much easting for the first few miles, it finally
struck directly across the Agua Frio, and came into the
true Prescott road near White Tanks. This Agua Frio,
usually one of Arizona's "dry rivers," we found with
three feet of water in it, and bad quicksands beneath
that. However, we discovered a practicable crossing,
and soon after nightfall reached the vicinity of White
Tanks, some thirty miles, since morning.

Here we camped by the roadside, glad to have struck
the regular Wickenburg or Prescott road at last, and went
supperless to sleep       for fear our fire, if made, might disclose
us to the Indians. We could find no water for our
poor animals, and the next morning would have missed
our accustomed coffee even, had we not taken the precaution
to keep our water-kegs well filled. Of course, we
broke camp early, and moved wearily on to the Hassayampa,
some ten or twelve miles, where we halted to water
up and lunch. This Hassayampa, ordinarily, is another
"dry river," like the Agua Frio, but we found three feet
or more of water in it, and bottomless quicksands nearly
everywhere. Our road, then the only road from Southern
to Northern Arizona, ran directly up the Hassayampa,
for some twelve or fifteen miles here, using the
river-bed as a roadway, as the only practicable route
through the mountains, and nobody had ventured through
for a month or more.

The Hassayampa itself flows through a wild and
rocky cañon, with high precipitous walls on either side;
and it was soon apparent, that our only alternative was[Pg 388]
either to flounder through its quicksands, or retrace our
steps to Maricopa Wells. The latter was out of the
question, as our rations and forage were both about exhausted,
and, besides, our improvised ferry-boat had
returned to the Gila; so that the only thing left for
us was to try the Hassayampa, and get through, somehow,
at all hazards. We had heard of a trail, across the
ridge and over the mountains, by the Vulture Mine,
and so into Wickenburg, by a roundabout course; but
a careful reconnoissance revealed no trace of it. We
called a "council of war," and discussed the "situation,"
pro and con, with due gravity, and finally decided
that there was nothing for us to do, but to ascend the
Hassayampa; and so, into it we plunged. And, verily,
it was a plunge. Nothing but a prolonged flounder, and
plunge, from ten a. m. to six p. m.! Now into the
stream; now out on a sand-bank; now deep into a quicksand;
crossing and recrossing, from side to side, to take
advantage of any land       not less than fifteen or twenty
times in the course of the twelve miles! Sometimes a
cavalry-man on horseback, "prospecting" the way for the
ambulances, would go down, until it seemed impossible
to extricate him and his horse. Again, an infantry-man,
on foot, would suddenly sink in to his armpits, and call
out to his comrades to come and rescue him. Then an
ambulance would slip to one side, and half of it commence
sinking, while the other half remained on solid
ground. Then our six-mule team would go in, and half
of the mules would flounder over the tongue, or turn a
summerset out of the harness, and, perhaps, come near
drowning, before they could be extricated, while the rest
would be all right. Now we would be all ashore, clambering
along the rocky walls of the cañon, to give the
ambulances a better chance; and now, all hands would[Pg 389]
be out into the water, to start a stalled team, and then
such a whooping and shouting, such a whipping and tugging
at the wheels, one seldom sees equalled. I campaigned
with McClellan, on the Peninsula; I was with
Burnside in his Mud Campaign, after Fredericksburg; we
had bad roads down in Tennessee and Georgia, when
after Joe Johnston and Hood. But this tedious and toilsome
drive, through the cañon and quicksands of the
Hassayampa, beat all these; and we never would have got
through, had we not had light loads, and skilful, plucky,
magnificent drivers.

As it was, we just managed by good luck to struggle
through, and got into Wickenburg about dusk, with
our animals thoroughly blown, and ourselves pretty well
used up. It had taken us just a week, to come through
from Maricopa Wells, usually a drive of a day or two       or
three, at the farthest. But the Gila and Salado
were still unfordable, and we would have been detained
at the Wells, probably, for a fortnight or more yet,
had it not been for Louis' boat. We found we were the
first party through in a month, and nobody was expected
to venture the Hassayampa either way, for a month or so
to come. Of course, with such rivers and roads       rivers
without either bridges or ferries, and roads that follow the
beds of rivers       our only conclusion was, that Arizona was
in no hurry, for either population or business; and, I judge,
this is about so. She must bridge her streams, and construct
good substantial roads       at least between all chief
points       before she can expect to grow and prosper. This
is fundamental in all civilized communities, and she
would have recognized it long since, had her population
been more from the busy North, than from the indolent,
happy-go-lucky South.



[Pg 390]




CHAPTER XXIV.

TUCSON TO PRESCOTT (continued).


Wickenburg, much longed for and at last
reached, we found to be an adobe hamlet, of perhaps
one or two hundred inhabitants, depending chiefly
on the Vulture Mine. We were all so thoroughly jaded
and worn out, by our rough ride through the country,
from Maricopa Wells, that we decided to halt there for
a day or two to rest and recruit. This afforded us an
opportunity to visit the Mine, which we gladly embraced,
as we had heard so much about it. It is really a
fine mine of gold-bearing quartz, off in the mountains,
some fifteen miles west of Wickenburg, whence the ore
was then wagoned to the mill, on the Hassayampa at
Wickenburg. It consists of a fine vein of free quartz,
from five to fifteen feet wide, and mostly devoid of sulphurets,
or other refractory substances. Seventy or
eighty men       half of them or more Mexicans       were hard
at work, sinking shafts and getting out ore; and already
a large amount of work had been done there. One shaft
was already down a hundred feet, and another half as
far       it being intended to connect the two by a lateral
gallery, to insure ventilation, etc. Unfortunately, no
water could be found near the mine, and all used there
then was transported from Wickenburg, at a cost of ten
cents per gallon. So, all the ore taken out had to be
wagoned, from the mine to the mill at Wickenburg,[Pg 391]
at a cost of ten dollars per ton. The cost of everything
else was about in the same proportion. Nevertheless, we
were told the mine paid, and that handsomely, and I
sincerely trust it did.

The mill at Wickenburg, belonging to the same company,
was a fine adobe structure, roofed with shingles, and
had just gone into operation. They had previously had a
small five-stamp mill, which paid very well; but this new
mill ran twenty stamps, and would crush forty tons of
quartz per day, when worked to its full capacity. Their
ore was reputed to average from fifty to seventy dollars per
ton, though of course "assaying" much more, and we were
assured would pay for working, if it yielded only from
twenty to thirty dollars per ton. If so, we thought,
stock in the Vulture Company must be a "gilt-edged"
investment; and their noble mine certainly was the best-looking
enterprise, we had yet seen in Arizona. It
appeared, however, to be a sort of "pocket" vein, as
prospecting on either side of it, as yet, had failed to discover
other points worth working. Fine as it was, the
mine was embarrassed by financial difficulties, and was
then in the hands of creditors, authorized to work it
until their claims were met, though these troubles it was
thought would soon end.

Thence on to Prescott, via Skull Valley, some eighty-four
miles, we passed without further mishap. We made
the distance in two and a-half days, and rolled into the
capital, just as the last rays of the setting sun were purpling
the triple peaks of the distant San Francisco
Mountains. The road generally was naturally a good
one, but here and there developed a peculiarity seldom
seen elsewhere. For example, on a perfectly good road,
apparently, even dry and dusty, suddenly a mule would
go in to his girth or a wheel to the hub, and there[Pg 392]
seemed no bottom to the execrable quicksands. In other
places, there had been surface-water or mud, that served
as a warning. But between Skull Valley and Prescott,
when trotting along as usual, we often struck spots,
where the dust was blowing, and yet when we ventured
on, our vehicles seemed bound for China or Japan, rather
than Prescott. Skull Valley itself proved to be a narrow
little vale, of perhaps a thousand or two acres, but
devoid of timber, and inaccessible in all directions, except
over bad mountains. A few ranches had been started
here, and a petty Military Post was there to protect
them; but this last had already been ordered away, the
location was so faulty, and with its departure, Skull
Valley, as a settlement, seemed likely to collapse.

Here and at Wickenburg were the only settlements,
and, indeed, the only population, we found between Maricopa
Wells and Prescott       a distance of nearly three hundred
miles, by the way we came. The whole intervening
country, as a rule, was barren and desolate, and absolutely
without population, except at the points indicated, until
you neared Prescott. There were not even such scattered
ranches, or occasional stations, as we found in crossing
the Colorado Desert, and ascending the Gila; but the
whole district seemed given over, substantially, to the
cayote and the Indian. The Apaches and Yavapais are
the two main tribes there, and were said to infest the
whole region, though we saw nothing of them. In the
valley of the Hassayampa, and across the Aztec
Mountains, they certainly had an abundance of ugly-looking
places, that seem as if specially made for ambuscades
and surprises. If they had attacked us in the
cañon of the Hassayampa, while floundering through
the quicksands there, they would have had things pretty
much their own way       at least, at first, vigilant as[Pg 393]
we were. They had killed a wandering Mexican there,
only a few days before; but we did not know it, until
we reached Wickenburg, and came through ourselves
unscathed.

Perhaps the worst place was Bell's Cañon, a long,
tortuous, rocky defile       diabolical in every respect       a
few miles south of Skull Valley. Here a Mr. Bell
and others had been killed by Apaches, some two years
before; and here also the Indian Agent, Mr. Levy, and
his clerk, had lost their lives, but a few weeks previously.
For miles there, the rocks have been tossed about in the
wildest possible confusion, and their grouping in many
instances is very extraordinary. A small band of Indians
there, ensconced among the rocks, would be able to make
a sharp fight, and nothing but cool heads and steady courage
would be likely to dislodge them. From the peaks
on either side, they can descry travellers a long way off,
through the clear atmosphere of that rainless region;
and should they decide to attack, nothing would be easier
than to conceal themselves behind the massive boulders,
that bristle along the cañon. We expected trouble here,
if anywhere in Arizona, and, as we approached it,
"governed ourselves accordingly." But the "noble Red
men" allowed their "Pale-face brothers" to pass in peace.
Arizonians spoke of this villanous-looking place, as
rather dangerous, and didn't care to venture through it
alone; but parties of two and three travelled it frequently,
and it seemed safe enough, if they went well
armed, and kept a sharp look out. The trouble is,
travellers in Arizona, and in all Indian districts, as a rule,
see no Indians, and so after a few days believe there are
none       become careless, wander on ahead, or straggle
along behind, without their arms       when presto! suddenly
arrows whiz from behind gigantic rocks or down[Pg 394]
shadowy cañons, and men are found dead in the road,
with their scalps gone. In all such regions, the only
safe rule is the rule of our western Borderers, to wit:
"Never unbuckle your six-shooter, and never venture
from your camp or train without your Spencer or
Henry!"

As I have already said, we found the intervening
country substantially unsettled, and much of it will
never amount to anything for agricultural purposes. Its
mineral resources may be great; but, as a rule, it lacks
both wood and water, and much of it is a barren desert,
given over forever to chemisal and grease-wood. On
the Agua Frio and Hassayampa, however, there are
considerable bottoms, that might be successfully irrigated;
and between the Gila and the Salado there is
a wide district, that deserves some further notice.
As you come up out of the Gila bottoms, you pass
through scattered mesquite trees, and at length enter
on a broad mèsa (Spanish for "table-land"), ten or
fifteen miles wide by thirty or forty long, which bears
every evidence of having once been well cultivated,
and densely populated. Instead of mesquite, you here
find clumps of chemisal two or three feet high, and bits
of broken pottery nearly everywhere. Farther on,
some eight or ten miles from the Salado, you find
immense ruins in various places, and soon strike a huge
acequia winding up from the Salado, in comparison with
which all the acequias we had yet seen in Utah or California
were the veriest ditches. It must be, I should
think, thirty feet wide by ten or twelve deep, and seems
like a great canal of modern times. Just where the road
to Fort McDowell crosses this, it subdivides into three
or four lesser acequias, and these branch off over the
mèsa indefinitely. This great acequia heads just above[Pg 395]
where we crossed the Salado. The river has a considerable
descent or "rapids" there, and the ancient
constructors of this gigantic water-course, apparently,
knew well how to take advantage of this. They have
tapped the river there by three immense mouths, all
leading into one common channel; and this they have
coaxed along down the bottoms, and gently up the bluff,
until at a distance of miles away it at last gained the
level of the mèsa, and there distributed abroad its fertilizing
waters. So, there are other ancient acequias,
furrowing the bottoms of the Salado on either side,
though we observed none so large as this.

The ruins of ancient buildings, thoroughly disintegrated,
are scattered widely along these bottoms, and
in some places there must certainly have been large
cities. The rectilinear courses of the walls, and the
dividing lines of the rooms, are all plainly visible still,
though nothing remains but the cobble-stones and
pebbles, out of which they seem to have been mainly
constructed, and here and there a bit of cement or
mortar. The ancient builders and occupiers of these
could not have been our present Indians there, because
they use different forms and materials. They could not
have been Mexicans or Spaniards, because they invariably
use brick or adobe. Who they were, where they
came from, when they disappeared and why       these are
knotty problems for the antiquarian, which it is to be
hoped time will soon solve. One thing is certain, these
ancient builders       Aztecs (as popularly believed) or whoever
they were       were at least good architects and engineers,
and they must have peopled much of Arizona
with an industrious and dense population, such as it will
not see again       I was going to say       for centuries to come.
But the Salado, in those days, must have been a larger[Pg 396]
river than it is now, or probably ever will be again;
because two or three of these old acequias would carry
off all its present waters, and leave none for the others,
whose remains yet furrow the country there everywhere.

However, the larger acequias may have been used only
as receiving reservoirs, to husband the spring freshets,
and for this purpose they might soon be utilized again.
However this may be, there are fine lands all along the
bottoms of the Salado, and enough water flowing there
yet to irrigate many thousands of acres. Indeed, the
best lands we saw in Arizona are here in the heart of it,
on the Gila and Salado, and in time no doubt there will
be flourishing settlements there. What the region
needs, is a railroad to connect it with "inside," or civilization;
and this the "Texas and Pacific," it seems, will
eventually furnish. Now, like so much of Arizona, it is
inaccessible, or practically five hundred miles across a
desert       from about everywhere. A railroad will remedy
all this, and stimulate Arizona wonderfully in many
ways. The whistle of the locomotive will end her Indian
troubles, and many others, and may she hear it echoing
and re-echoing among her mountains and cañons very
soon! A railroad, indeed, is a great blessing everywhere;
but in our western territories it means civilization as
well, and without one Arizona will evidently continue
to slumber on, as she has for so many years.



[Pg 397]




CHAPTER XXV.

PRESCOTT, THE APACHES, ETC.


Prescott had been described to us, as resembling
very much a "New England village." We were told
so in San Francisco. It was repeated at Fort Yuma. It
was hinted at Tucson. Well, perhaps, it did, except as
regards school-houses and churches, white paint and
green blinds, general thriftiness, and a wholesome respect
for law and order. Eliminating these, Prescott, perhaps,
was quite New-Englandish; but, otherwise, it resembled
rather some country cross-roads in Missouri, or Arkansas.
In brief, there was not a school-house, or church, or bank,
in the place. Business we found at a general stand-still,
because of absolute stagnation among the mines. And
the peaceable and quiet population had just shown their
New-Englandlike disposition, by robbing and beating a
squad of United States soldiers       a part of those recently
sent out better to protect that region       mortally wounding
one, and severely injuring several others. Of course, the
Blue-Coats were off duty, or the cowards wouldn't have
assailed them.

Said I to an old acquaintance I met, an ex-Army of
the Potomac officer:

"I hear you have quite a New England village
here?"

"Yes, indeed, it is very New-Englandlike! Last
night I was in our billiard-saloon here. A game of[Pg 398]
monte was going on in one corner, brag-poker in another,
and a couple of dogs were having a free fight under the
billiard-table. I lived in Boston once for some time, but
have no recollection of seeing anything exactly like
that!"

"But you have a good class of population, have you
not, as a general thing?"

"O yes! Excellent! Less than five hundred, altogether!
But we have ten drinking-saloons, and a dozen
gambling-hells, more or less! What kind of a population
that implies, judge for yourself!"

I think my friend was, perhaps, somewhat prejudiced.
He had, probably, invested in mining "feet," and found
out he had made a "permanent investment," with slight
prospect of "dividends." Nevertheless, Prescott had
been much overrated and bepraised, and, consequently,
suffered somewhat in the estimation of strangers. We
found it well laid-out, on a scale of Magnificent Distances,
like its illustrious prototype, the National Capital, and
lacking only       buildings and people to be a fine city. Its
site, though nearly six thousand feet above the sea, is a
good one, along the undulating bottoms of Granite
Creek, about a mile or so from Fort Whipple, then the
chief military-post in northern Arizona. Its houses were
grouped mostly around a spacious plaza, after the old
Spanish custom, though a few straggled off into ragged
streets either way. They were chiefly of logs and rough
lumber, and guiltless of paint, though some brick and
adobe structures appeared here and there. The population
seemed to be between four and five hundred. The
autumn previous, it had been largely increased by a notable
immigration from Montana, which came to Prescott
with the expectation of finding rich placer mines, from
what they had seen published about the region. But[Pg 399]
the most of these had already left, cruelly disappointed,
and others would follow, if they had the means. The
barber, who shaved me one day, proved to be a Montanian,
from Helena City. I asked him, casually, what he
thought of Arizona.

"Why, you see, stranger, I pays for this yer room
eight dollars a month, in "dust." For a room in Helena
City, of the same size, I paid last summer seventy-five
dollars per month."

"You mean that for a fair comparison of Arizona,
with Montana?"

"Sartin! Thet's about it naow, you bet! Our fellers,
who come down yer with me last fall, most all gone;
others leavin' every week. I'm goin' to vamose, too,
'fore long, you bet!"

These placer mines were scattered over a district of
ten or twelve miles around Prescott, and the truth
seemed to be, that as a general thing they had produced
poorly. It appeared, there were two or three hundred
men, in all, engaged in them still, but these were making
only indifferent wages, and many were quite discouraged.
The quartz mines covered a much wider area, and beyond
question were very rich in the precious metals; but the
ores were sulphurets, of the most refractory character,
and there was no known "process" to work them at a profit.
Eleven mills, of from five to twenty stamps each,
had been erected, at mines whose ores assayed from one
hundred to two hundred or more dollars per ton       an
excellent yield, of course. But, of all these, only one
five-stamp mill was then running       the Ticonderoga       and
that was reported as only about paying expenses.
Instead of two hundred dollars, or more, per ton, as per
assay, the mills in fact could only stamp out and save
from ten to twenty dollars per ton; and this was a losing[Pg 400]
business. A new "process" was just being tried at the
Eureka Mill, which did excellently well, as per assay in
the laboratory; but it was uncertain what would be the
result, when applied to large quantities of ore in the
mill. The Bully-Bueno and Sterling lodes seemed to be
the most in favor. Specimens from the Sterling, that
were shown, were indeed wonderful in richness, and
there seemed to be no doubt that the ledges around
Prescott abound in mines, which will yield very largely,
if only a process can be found to treat successfully such
obstinate and refractory sulphurets. For the present,
however, mining operations about Prescott were very
"sick," with poor prospect of speedy recovery. The
region had indeed two advantages, very rare in Arizona,
to wit, good fuel, and sufficient water. The breadth of
timber here, however, had been much overstated. An
area of ten miles square or so embraced the bulk of the
pine, which was an exceptional growth just there; the
rest consisted chiefly of scrawny juniper and scraggly
cedar, fit only for fuel and fencing.

The Territorial capital was still at Prescott, but its
permanent location was yet to be decided on. Maricopa
Wells and Tucson were both contending for the honor,
and the latter it seems has since won it. Ultimately,
however, it is probable, the Territory will divide on the
line of the Gila, and Prescott again become the capital
of the northern part of it. Arizona naturally and
geographically subdivides on that line, and the interests
of the two sections are usually quite divergent. The
population of the territory was variously computed at
from three to four thousand only, of whom the major portion
by far were Mexicans and their descendants. The
other whites were mainly Arkansans and Texans, many of
them no doubt exiles from the East, "for their country's[Pg 401]
good." Of course, this was not a very promising basis
for a commonwealth, and the Territory, it appeared, was
about at a stand-still. As evidence of this, there was
not then a bank, or banking-house, or free-school, or
Protestant church, or missionary even, throughout the
whole of Arizona       a region some four or five times as
large as the great State of New York. The Indian population
was estimated at about twenty thousand, of whom
ten thousand were regarded as friendly, five thousand as
hostile, and five thousand as half and half       that is, sometimes
friendly, and sometimes hostile, depending on circumstances.
To offset and antagonize these, the Government
had then about twenty-five hundred regular
soldiers in Arizona, which would seem sufficient, if well
handled, though the people of course were clamoring for
more. The great controlling tribe in Arizona, and
extending into New Mexico, and the terror of the
Mexican border, were the Apaches. Those that we saw
gave one the impression of a fierce, sinewy, warlike
race, very different from the Plains Indians, and it was
plain there would be no peace in Arizona, nor much
hope for its development, until these Apaches received a
thorough chastisement. This they had never yet had,
from either Mexicans or Americans, and consequently they
despised and hated the Pale Faces, as we hate (or ought
to hate) Satan himself. They inhabited the mountains
chiefly, though they often descended into the plains, and
in bands of two or three, or more, scoured the country
far and near, as it suited them. About Tucson and
Tubac they stole stock, and occasionally killed travellers,
often within a mile or two of the towns. Sometimes,
for months together, they would leave a road unmolested,
and then, suddenly, attacking it at different points, clean
out all the ranches. A few miles from Camp McDowell,[Pg 402]
on the road between there and Maricopa Wells, they
infested a rocky cañon on the Rio Salado, and mockingly
defied all attempts to expel them. A fortnight
before we reached Maricopa Wells, en route to Tucson,
a party of them crossed the Salado and Gila, and
stole ten head of stock from a ranch only three miles
from the Wells. About the same time, another party
of three lurked around the station at Blue Water, on the
road to Tucson, some fifty miles south of the Wells,
and, failing to find anything they could steal, vented
their spleen by shooting an arrow into a valuable horse
that was stabled safely from their reach. This done,
the same night they struck across the country, some
fifteen or twenty miles, to the peaceable Pimo settlements
on the Gila, where they each stole a couple of
horses apiece, and made good their escape with them to
the mountains.

Some of their exploits were very amusing, as well as
very daring, worthy of the best days of Osceola or
Tecumseh. We heard one of a party, that had just preceded
us in Arizona. They camped at a station for the
night, and thought their animals thoroughly secure,
when they had put them into an adobe corral, with a
wall four or five feet high by two thick, and then lay
down themselves across the only entrance, with their
rifles by their sides. The stealthy Apaches waited
until their pale-face friends were well asleep, and then
with a piece of dry cow-hide, hard and thin, sawed out
a section of the adobe wall, at the other end of the corral,
and in the morning Los Americanos found themselves
horseless and muleless. We may "fancy their
feelings," when they discovered the opening! Just then,
I fear, they would have made poor Peace Commissioners!
Especially, as they had to foot it fifty miles, back to the
next station, for new animals!

[Pg 403]

There was another story told of a gallant army officer,
who had been out on a scout the year before, and was
determined not to lose a favorite horse he had along.
The Apaches were about thick, and the night before had
stolen several animals, in spite of the utmost vigilance.
To guard against what he supposed even the possibility
of loss, the officer picketed his horse with a lariat to a
tree, and then spreading his blankets camped down under
the tree       at the same time posting a sentinel over his
horse, with strict orders to watch faithfully. Toward
morning the sentry thought the horse was a little farther
from the tree than he should be; still, as he saw nothing
suspicious, he supposed he must be mistaken as to the
length of the lariat. After walking a few more beats,
he thought the horse was still farther off; but it seemed
so little, and the horse was so quiet, he did not think it
right to make an alarm. A few beats more, however,
convinced him that something must be wrong, as the
horse was evidently still farther away. But now, simultaneously
with his challenge, lo! an Apache sprang
lithely upon the steed, and in a twinkling he was galloping
off through the chaparral and cactuses, with a yell
of defiance at the astonished Blue Coat! Creeping
stealthily up in the dark, with a more than cat-like
caution and silence, he had severed the lariat, and edged
the horse off little by little, until at last his capture was
sure.

If a party were strong, or not worth cleaning out, or
killing, the Apaches usually gave them a wide berth.
But woe to those whom they marked for their prey, if
not well armed, and ceaselessly vigilant. They would
dog a party for days, with the tireless energy of the
sleuth-hound, watching for an unguarded moment in
which to attack, and then suddenly pounce upon them,[Pg 404]
like fiends, as they were. As a rule, they used bows and
arrows still; but many had fire-arms, and knew how to
handle them with deadly effect. We were shown several
of their children, captured in different fights, and they
were the wiriest, fiercest little savages imaginable. Sullen,
dogged, resolute little Red Skins, they lacked only
maturity and strength to "make their mark" on somebody's
head; and this they seemed quite likely to do yet,
unless their Apache natures were thoroughly "reconstructed."
They had a peculiar and pleasant penchant
for setting fire to hay-stacks and ranches, and on the
whole were a species of population, that nobody but an
Arizonian would care much to fancy. They were held
as servants in different families, and their service in too
many instances approximated to downright slavery       so
much so, indeed, that the attention of the Territorial
authorities was already being directed to the matter.

As if to give us some proof of their enterprise and
audacity, a band of these Apaches made a raid near
Prescott, the very day we arrived there. They attacked
a ranch only three miles east of "this New-England-like"
village, and seized several cattle and drove them
off. A mounted scout was at once sent out from Fort
Whipple, and though they marched seventy-five miles in
twenty-four hours, they failed to come up with the Red
Skins. The officer in command reported the bold marauders
as strong in numbers, and fleeing in the direction of
Hell Cañon       an ugly, diabolical-looking place, some forty
miles east of Prescott. Gen. Gregg, then commanding
the District of Prescott, immediately ordered out two
fresh companies of cavalry, and, himself at their head,
made a forced march by night, in order to surprise them
in their reported stronghold. Next morning at daybreak,
he was at Hell Cañon, but no Apaches were found there,[Pg 405]
nor any traces of them. After a brief halt, he ordered
the cavalry to follow down the cañon to its junction with
the Verde, and after scouring all the cañons centering
there, to return by a wide detour to Fort Whipple. The
General himself now returned to Prescott, and I cheerfully
bear witness to his vigor and chagrin, having
accompanied him out and back. A detachment of the
cavalry, a day or two afterwards, succeeded in finding a
rancheria of Apaches in a villainous cañon, miles away to
the southwest of the Verde       a thin curling smoke in the
mountains revealing their presence. The troops pushed
boldly in, and came suddenly on the rancheria, or village,
before they were discovered. Dismounting from their
horses, they poured in a rapid volley from their Spencer
carbines, that killed five Apaches, and wounded twice as
many more. The rest fled, but in a few minutes bravely
rallied, and soon came swarming back, down the cañon
and along its rocky cliffs, in such numbers and with such
spirit, that the officer in command deemed it prudent to
fall back on the main column. This he succeeded in
doing, but it required a march of several miles, as the
column had moved on; and when he rejoined, it was
thought best for the whole command to return to Fort
Whipple, as their rations and forage were about exhausted.
Subsequently, Gregg sent them out again, and this time
they succeeded in damaging the Apaches very considerably;
but it was not long before they were lurking about
the country again.

The rough ride to Hell Cañon and back, despite
occasional snow-squalls, was not unpleasant, and not without
its interest. Our route in the main was down the
valley of Granite Creek, and past the site of old Fort
Whipple, now called Postle's Ranch. Here was a fine
plateau of several hundred acres, with acequias and a[Pg 406]
petty grist-mill, the whole used formerly by the troops;
but occupied now by only a family or two. The truth
is, population was too sparse, and the Apaches too plenty,
to make farming an agreeable occupation just there. We
saw several men at work in the fields, as we rode along,
all with rifles slung across their backs, and the infrequent
settlers protested they meant to quit the country, as soon
as their harvests matured. The last ranch eastward       the
one most remote from Prescott, and, consequently,
the very edge of the frontier there       was owned and occupied
by what may justly be called a typical American
emigrant. Born in New Jersey, the nephew of an
eminent minister there, he early emigrated to Canada,
and thence to Michigan. Here he married, and soon
afterwards emigrated to Illinois. Thence he went to
Kansas, and thence to New Mexico. Subsequently, he
emigrated to California, and when he grew weary there,
as he could "go west" no farther, concluded to remove
to Arizona. Here he had been for two years, with his
family, on the very edge of the border; but was now
tired of the West, and meditating a return East. He said
his children were growing up, and needed school-houses
and churches, and he meant to sell out and leave as soon
as practicable.

The country as a whole proved barren and sterile,
like so much of Arizona elsewhere, though here also the
Aztecs (or whoever the ancient population were) had
left their marks, as on the Salado and Gila. The
remains of edifices, or fortifications, and acequias, were
still quite visible in various places, and no doubt the
ancient settlers had followed up the rivers, and their
tributaries, nearly everywhere. They seem to have been
a pushing, progressive people, bent on conquest and
civilization, after their kind, and doubtless swayed the[Pg 407]
whole interior of the continent. At Point of Rocks, on
Willow Creek, we halted for an hour or two, to explore
the wonderful rock-formations there; and subsequently
dined with a settler on a wild turkey, that stood four
feet high and weighed forty-three pounds, when first
shot, and about thirty pounds dressed. We were tired
and hungry, from long riding and light rations, and you
may be sure enjoyed our meal to the full.

Fort Whipple, already alluded to several times, was
situated on Granite Creek, a mile and a half east of Prescott,
near the centre of a Reservation there a mile
square. It consisted of a rude stockade, enclosing the
usual log quarters and barracks of our frontier posts,
and was then Headquarters of all the district north of
the Gila. Its garrison was small, and dependencies few
and petty; but the cost of maintaining it seemed
something enormous. Here are a few of the prices
then current at the post: hay cost about sixty dollars
per ton; grain, about twelve dollars per bushel; lumber,
from fifty to seventy-five dollars per thousand; freight
on supplies, from San Francisco (and about everything
had to come from there via the Gulf of California and
the Colorado), two hundred and fifty dollars per ton;
and these all in coin. The flag-staff alone, quite a
respectable "liberty-pole," was reported to have cost ten
thousand dollars; and District Headquarters       a one-and-a-half
story frame house, surrounded by verandas, but
barely comfortable and genteel       was said to have cost
one hundred thousand dollars. This last, plain as
it was, was then about the best modern edifice in
Arizona, but was used as the Post Hospital       Gen.
Gregg ("Cavalry Gregg" of the Army of the Potomac)
in the true spirit of a soldier, declining to occupy it,
until his sick and disabled men were first well sheltered,[Pg 408]
and provided for. Himself and staff, as yet, shared the
log cabins of the Post proper, through whose open
crannies the wind and rain had free course to run and be
glorified, during every storm. We were there during a
wild tempest of rain and hail, as well as for a week or
more besides, and learned well how to appreciate their
infelicities and miseries. All honor to this chivalrous
and gallant Pennsylvanian, for his courtesy and humanity.
A Bayard and a Sydney combined, surely he
deserves well of his country; and the Army may justly
be proud of such a representative soldier.



[Pg 409]




CHAPTER XXVI.

PRESCOTT TO LOS ANGELOS.


Prescott, as already intimated, was not Paradise,
and we left there April 13th, for Los Angelos, via
Hardyville and Fort Mojave, on our return "inside,"
with real rejoicing. Our first stage was to Fort Mojave,
on the Colorado, distant one hundred and sixty miles,
and this we made in five days. Of course, we travelled
by ambulance, and "camped out" every night, as elsewhere
mostly in Arizona. The road was a toll-road, but
its general condition was hardly such, as to justify the
collection of tolls ordinarily. As a whole, it was
naturally a very fair road, though there were some bad
points, as at Juniper Mountain and Union Pass, where
considerable work had been required to carry the grades
along. At Williamson's Valley, twenty miles out from
Prescott, we found one of the best agricultural and grazing
districts, that we had yet seen in Arizona. There
were but two or three settlers there then, though there
were apparently several thousands of acres fit for farms.
The hills adjacent abounded in scattered cedars and junipers,
that would do for fencing and fuel, and game
seemed more abundant near there, than in any place we
had yet been. Quails, found everywhere in Arizona to
some extent, here soon thickened up; the jack-rabbits
bounded more numerously through the bushes; even
pigeons and wild-turkeys were heard of; and as we[Pg 410]
rattled down through a rocky glen, at the western side
of the valley, a herd of likely deer cantered leisurely
across the road       the first we had seen in Arizona, or
indeed elsewhere in the West.

Thence across Juniper Mountain to Rock Springs, some
fifty miles, the country was wild and desolate, with a
scraggy growth of cedars and junipers much of the way.
A few scattered oaks and pines grew here and there, but
they could scarcely be called good timber, or much of it.
At Rock Springs was a fine bottom of several hundred
acres, but not a single inhabitant. Thence on to Hardyville,
through Cottonwood Cañon, past Hualapai Springs,
Beale's Springs, etc., for nearly a hundred miles, there were
no ranches, and no cultivable lands, indeed, worth mentioning.
The country, as a whole, seemed a vast volcanic
desert       of mountains, cañons, and mesas       and what it
was ever made for, except to excite wonder and astonishment,
is a mystery to the passing traveller. Even at the
high elevation we were travelling, usually four or five
thousand feet above the sea, the sun was already intensely
hot by day, though the air grew bitingly cold at
night, before morning. The principal growth, after
leaving Rock Springs, was sage-brush and grease-wood,
and in many places it proved difficult to secure sufficient
for fires of even these. Water was found only at distances
of ten and twenty miles apart, and in the dry
summer months it must be still scarcer. Our poor animals
suffered greatly, and one day we came near losing several       two
of them continuing sick far into the night. Now
and then we found an Indian trail crossing the road, but
the Red Skins either did not see us, or else kept themselves
well under cover, intimidated by the half-dozen
cavalrymen, that accompanied us as escort.

The prevailing hues of the landscape were a dull red[Pg 411]
and brownish gray, and these produced at times some very
singular and striking effects. The one thing, that relieved
our ride from utter dullness and monotony, was the
weird and picturesque forms, in which nature has there
piled up her rocks, and chiseled out her mountains.
Domes, peaks, terraces, castles, turrets, ramparts       all
were sculptured against the cloudless sky; and we fell to
interesting ourselves sometimes for hours, as we rode
along, in tracing out the strange resemblances to all sorts
of architecture and animals, ancient and modern, that
nature, in her silent sublimity, has perpetrated there.
At sunset, when parting day lingered and played upon
the surrounding or distant mountains, it bathed their
rock-ribbed sides and summits in the most gorgeous tints
of purple and maroon, and filled the imagination with
all that was most sublime and mysterious. What Milton
must have thought of in portraying Hell, or Dante imagined
in delineating the weird and sombre landscapes
of his awful Inferno, may well be realized in passing
through this singular region, where Desolation seems to
have outstretched her wings, and made up her mind to
brood gloomily forever.

At Union Pass, we crossed the last mountain range,
at an elevation of fully five thousand feet, whence we
caught welcome sight again of the ruby waters of the
Colorado. Debouching into the valley, we presently
struck the river at Hardyville. Here it winds its
sinuous course, through a broad valley of volcanic mesas
and mountains, and has no bottoms worth mentioning,
except those occupied of old by the Mojave Indians.
These are fertilized by the annual overflow of the Colorado,
like the bottoms of the Nile, and no doubt might
be made to produce very largely. As it was, the
Mojaves scratched them a little, so as to plant some corn[Pg 412]
and barley, and raise a few beans, vegetables, etc., the
surplus of which they sold chiefly at Hardyville, for Mr.
Hardy to re-sell to the Government again       of course, at
a profit. It seemed, on the whole, that they did not
usually raise enough, off of all their broad acres, to feed
and clothe themselves comfortably; and we were told
they would often go hungry, were it not for the gratuitous
issues of flour, meal, and other supplies occasionally
made to them by the commanding officer at
Fort Mojave. We rode through their villages one
evening, while halting at Fort Mojave, and found they
numbered about a thousand or so just there; but farther
down the Colorado, at La Paz, there was said to be
another branch of them, even more numerous. They
were usually a shapely, well-made race, and seemed to
take life even more easy, if possible, than their red
brethren elsewhere. Their women made a rude pottery
ware, that seemed in general use among them, and the
men themselves sometimes labored commendably, in gathering
drift-wood for fuel for the petty steamers, that occasionally
ascended to Hardyville. These Mojaves had been
quiet and peaceable for years, and it seemed very moderate
efforts would put them on the road to civilization,
as readily as the Choctaws and the Cherokees. But
they complained, and quite justly, that the Government
did not furnish them implements, tools, seeds, etc., to
enable them to work their lands and support themselves,
while the savage Hualapais, Pai-Utes, and other hostile
tribes, were being constantly bribed with presents and
annuities. This, however, was only another instance
of the stupidity and blundering of our Indian Department
at that time, whose policy, or rather impolicy,
seemed to be to neglect friendly Indians, and exhaust its
money and efforts on hostile ones, under the plea of[Pg 413]
"pacifying" them! As if "gifts" and "annuities"
ever really pacified or civilized a Red Skin yet, or ever
will! No; the only true policy with our Indians, then
as now, is to encourage and reward the friendly, in
every right way; while the hostile ones should be turned
over to the Army, for chastisement and surveillance,
to the uttermost, until they learn the hard lesson, that
henceforth they must behave themselves.

Fort Mojave, some four miles or so below Hardyville,
on the east bank of the Colorado, was a rude post,
most uncomfortable every way. It had been established
originally in 1860, abandoned in 1861, but re-occupied
in 1864, and maintained since then. We found it hot,
and dusty, and miserable, even in April; and could well
imagine what it must be in July and August. At Prescott,
we were some six thousand feet above the sea; but
here we had got down to only about eleven hundred, and
the change was most perceptible. Here were a handful
of troops, and two or three officers, all praying for the
day when they might be ordered elsewhere, assured that
fortune could send them to no worse post, outside of
Alaska. One officer had his wife along, a lady delicately
bred, from Pittsburg, Pa., and this was her first experience
of Army life. When we first arrived, she tried to
talk cheerily, and bore up bravely for awhile; but before
we left, she broke down in tears, and confessed to her
utter loneliness and misery. No wonder, when she was
the only white woman there, no other within a hundred
miles or more; and no newspaper or mail even, except
once a month or fortnight, as things happened to be.

Hardyville itself was then more of a name than place,
consisting chiefly of a warehouse and quartz-mill, with
a few adobe shanties. Near Hardyville, some ten or
twenty miles away in the outlying mountains, there[Pg 414]
were several mines       gold, silver, and copper       of more
or less richness, and the mill was located here to take
advantage of the two great essentials, wood and water.
The mill, however, was standing idle, like most enterprises
in Arizona, and but little was doing in the
mines. Mr. Hardy himself, a hard-working energetic
man, and the Ben Holliday or Gen. Banning of that
region, controlling all its business, including Government
contracts, from the Colorado to Prescott and
beyond, was getting out some ore, and specimens we
saw at his store were certainly very handsome. He said
there were "leads" in the neighboring mountains of
exceeding richness, and indeed here and at other similar
points along the Colorado, as at La Paz, Aubrey City,
El Dorado Cañon, etc., there seemed the best chances
for mining of anywhere in Arizona. Here were wood
(drift-wood, in which the Colorado abounds) and water,
the two great needs, usually wanting elsewhere in
Arizona; and the Colorado itself, it would seem, ought
to afford reasonably cheap and quick transportation, if
the steamboats on it were constructed and run with
proper enterprise and efficiency.

The great drawback to Arizona then, overshadowing
perhaps all others, not excepting the Apaches, was the
perfectly frightful and ruinous cost of transportation.
To reach any mining-district there from California,
except those along the Colorado, you had to travel from
three to five hundred miles through what are practically
deserts; and for every ton of freight carried into or out
of the Territory, you were called on to pay from three
to five cents per pound, per hundred miles, in coin. Golconda,
itself, could not flourish under such circumstances,
much less Arizona       which is scarcely a Golconda. The
patent and palpable remedy for all this, was either a railroad[Pg 415]
or the speedy and regular navigation of the Colorado.
It seemed nonsense to say that the Colorado could not
be navigated, and that too at rates reasonably cheap. It
looked no worse than the Ohio and the Missouri, and like
western rivers ordinarily; and there appeared but small
hope for Arizona very speedily, until she availed herself
to the full of its actual advantages. With the alleged
mines along the Colorado, from Ft. Yuma to El Dorado,
in good operation, her population, as it increased, would
naturally overflow to other districts; and, in the end, arid
Arizona would become reasonably prosperous. But, like
all other commonwealths, she must have a base to stand
on and work from. That base seemed naturally and
necessarily the Colorado River, indifferent as it was.
And all attempts to develop herself, except from that, in
the absence of a railroad, seemed likely to end like the
efforts of the man, who tried to build a pyramid with the
apex downward. History declares it was not a "success."

Bidding good-bye to our friends at Fort Mojave, we
crossed the Colorado on a rude flat-boat, on the evening
of April 18th, and proceeded three miles to Beaver Lake
where we camped for the night, in order to get a
good start next day. We dismissed our escort at Fort
Mojave, as no longer necessary; and, Gov. McCormick
and wife having left us at Prescott, our little party
was now reduced to two and our drivers. Col. Carter,
Secretary of the Territory, had accompanied us from
Prescott to Mojave; but here he left us for a trip up
the Colorado, intending to push into the Big Cañon,
if possible. Subsequently, I learned, he failed in doing
this; but the fault was not his, and, for the present, we
bade him speedy success and a safe return.

From Fort Mojave, on the Colorado, to Los Angelos
was still about three hundred miles, and this we accomplished[Pg 416]
in eight days. The valley or great basin
of the Colorado extends most of the distance, and of the
intervening country, as a whole, the most that can be
said of it is, that it is an absolute desert of extinct volcanoes
and outstretched sand-plains, fit only for tarantulas
and centipedes, rattlesnakes and Indians. As far as
could be seen, I think this a fair and truthful statement
of pretty much all that region to Cajon Pass, and don't
see how it can well be objected to, by any honest mind.
Its changes of elevation are, indeed, something very
curious. At Fort Mojave, on the banks of the Colorado,
you are only about a thousand feet above the sea.
Thence, for ten or twelve miles, you steadily ascend,
until you get where the view of the Colorado Valley proper
becomes something really sublime       a barren ocean,
a sea of desolation, with a line of living green meandering
through the centre       and at Pai-Ute Hill, only some
thirty miles from the Colorado, you reach an elevation
of some four thousand feet. At Government Holes,
indeed, you get up to 5,204 feet; but at Soda Lake,
about a hundred miles from Fort Mojave, you descend
again to 1,075 feet, or seventy-four feet lower than the
Colorado itself.[23] From here you climb back to 1,852
feet at Camp Cady, some forty miles from Soda Lake;
2,678 feet at Cottonwood Ranch, some eighty miles
from Soda Lake; and gradually get up again to 5,000
feet at Cajon Pass, about one hundred and twenty miles
from Soda Lake. These ascents and descents usually
are not sudden, nor indeed much perceptible; but gradually
you roll up and down over a vast desert region,[Pg 417]
where the sun was already (in April) intensely hot by
day, and getting to be fairly warm at night.

In the long drives by day, sometimes forty and fifty
miles       to reach water       the heat and glare from the
sand became terrible to the eyes, and twice we drove all
night, lying by in the day, to avoid this. By day, we
usually saw no live thing, except here and there a stray
buzzard, or scampering lizard, or horned toad. By night,
we would hear the rattlesnakes hiss and rattle, as we
drove along       our "outfit" as we rattled by, I suppose,
disturbing their quiet siestas, or moonlight promenades.
It was too early in the season, however, to be troubled
much with such interesting acquaintances as rattlesnakes,
tarantulas, centipedes, etc. They were but just beginning
to come out of their holes, and we were glad to
escape from the country before they ventured forth much.
We saw, indeed, some centipedes, and killed several
rattlesnakes. One night one of the party woke up, and
found something reposing snugly on the outside of his
blankets. Giving it a kick and sling from underneath, it
proved to be a snake, and answered him back from the place
where it landed, with the usual inevitable hiss and defiant
rattle. Another night, at Soda Lake, while sleeping by
the rocks there, a rattlesnake crawled under the bottom
blankets, and in the morning when the owner of them
began to yawn and stretch himself, preparatory to getting
up, his snakeship from beneath hissed, and rattled, and
protested, as badly as a northern copperhead or a southern
rebel at the Proclamation of Emancipation, or the
Reconstruction measures of Congress. Of course, we
all slept on the ground every night, ex necessitate; but,
after this, we usually retired with all our clothes and
tallest boots on!

Pai-Ute hill, so-called (before spoken of), is really a[Pg 418]
sharp and ugly little mountain, up which we toiled slowly
and wearily. In rounding an angle of the road, soon
after beginning the ascent, one of our ambulances sliding
struck a rock, and soon like the famous "One Hoss
Shay," ended in a "general spill!" There could hardly
have been a more thorough collapse of spokes and felloes       everything
seemed to go to pieces       and it could hardly
have occurred in a worse place. It was a wild and desolate
cañon, barren and rocky, miles away from every
human habitation; yet there was nothing for it, but to
leave the driver in charge, and the rest of us proceed on
to Camp Rock Springs, whence we sent an army-wagon
back to gather up the remains and bring them on.
Camp Rock Springs itself was a forlorn military post,
consisting of one officer and perhaps a dozen men, guarding
the Springs and the road there. The officer was
quartered in a natural cave in the hillside, and his men
had "hutted" themselves out on the sand the best they
could. No glory there, nor much chance for military
fame; but true patriots and heroes were they, to submit
to such privations. Too many of our frontier posts are
akin to this, and little do members of Congress east, who
know only "the pomp and circumstance of glorious war,"
imagine what army-life out there really is. It is a poor
place for fuss and feathers, gilt epaulets and brass buttons;
and our "Home Guard," holiday Militia east, so fond of
parading up and down our peaceful streets, with full
rations and hotel quarters, would soon acquire for soldiering
there only a rare and infinite disgust. Yet these are
the nurseries of the Army, and from such hard schools
we graduated a Grant and Sherman, Sheridan and
Thomas.

Soda Lake, already mentioned, is simply a dried-up
lake, or sea, whose salts of soda effloresce and whiten the[Pg 419]
ground, like snow, for miles in every direction. The
country there is a vast basin, rimmed around with desolate
hills and mountains, and during the rainy season a
considerable body of water, indeed, collects here. Soon,
however, evaporation does its work, and the Lake proper
subsides to little or nothing, worth speaking of. When
we were there, it was said to be twenty miles long, by
four or five wide, though of course everywhere very
marshy or shallow. Skirting the borders of it, we
reached a rocky bluff on (I think) the northern shore,
and there found a noble spring of excellent water, welling
up of from unknown depths, within a stone's throw
of the soda deposits. Here was the usual halting-place,
and as we had driven all night, we went into camp on
arriving there, soon after sunrise. It was Sunday, April
21st; there was no house or even hut there; no person
or living thing; and what with the heat, and glare, and
awful desolation       our weariness, fatigue, and sense of
isolation       I think it was about the most wretched and
miserable day I ever spent anywhere. To crown all,
during the night before, while jogging along, we had
descried what we supposed to be an Indian camp-fire, off
to the south of the road some distance; we had driven
quietly but hastily on, getting the utmost out of our
jaded mules; but whether the Red Skins were asleep, or
had discovered and were now dogging us, awaiting their
opportunity, we were blissfully ignorant. We passed
the hours away, as best we could, sleeping and watching
in turn; but the next morning, bright and early, we were
up and off for Camp Cady. We would have departed,
indeed, by night; but the route lay largely up the disgusting
cañon of the Mojave, and was impracticable in
the dark. This was the only sign of hostile Indians we
saw en route from the Colorado. We could hardly call it[Pg 420]
a genuine "scare;" and yet were not greatly grieved,
when we found they had given us a wide berth.

Some fifteen or twenty miles beyond Soda Lake, we
struck the Mojave River, so-called, which there runs for
several miles through a narrow and rocky cañon, much
similar to that of the Hassayampa, though its walls are not
so high. The road itself leads up this cañon, for lack of a
better route over and through the mountains there, and
on first view, it promised to be the Hassayampa over
again; but, fortunately, the bottom is chiefly gravel and
rock, and therefore has not the same disagreeable habit
of "dropping out," when you venture over it. We
found from one to two feet of water in the Mojave here,
and crossed it, I suppose, at least thirty or forty times
between there and Camp Cady       within say twenty
miles. Two days afterward, when we crossed it for the
last time, farther up, at what is called the Upper Crossing
of the Mojave, we found it two feet deeper than it
had been a hundred miles below, and with more than
twice the volume of water. Our famous Pathfinder, in
one of his great expeditions, struck it near here, at
freshet height, and it is said reported the Mojave as
"an important tributary of the Colorado, navigable
for light-draft steamboats several months in the year."
He would have been partly right, perhaps, if the Mojave
indeed continued on to the Colorado. But unfortunately,
it sinks in the desert, long before it gets there; and the
enthusiastic explorer's "light-draft steamboats" would
have to go paddling across a broad expanse of sand and
rock, if they wanted to voyage from the Mojave to the
Colorado, or vice versa! The Mojave, in fact, although
draining the snow-capped San Bernardino Mountains,
and a wide stretch of country there, is only another of
the many strange anomalies that one meets with in[Pg 421]
Southern California and Arizona. Said a ranchman in
that region:

"Dis yer's a quar country, stranger, you bet! All
sorts of quar things out yer. Folks chop wood with a
sledge-hammer, and mow grass with a hoe. Every bush
bears a thorn, and every insect has a sting. The trees
is pretty nigh all cactuses. The streams haint no water,
except big freshets. The rivers get littler, the furder
they run down. No game but rabbits, and them's big as
jackasses. Some quails, but all top-knotted, and wild as
greased lightning. No frost; no dew. Nobody kums
yer, unless he's runnin' away. Nobody stays, unless he
has to. Everybody 'vamoses the ranch,' 'cuts stick,'
'absquatulates,' as soon as he kin raise nuff 'dust' to
'git up and git' with. You bet       ye! Sure!"

It is due to truth to say, that our friend had just got
up from the "break-bone" fever, and was still troubled
with the "shakes." His mine had "petered out," and
his "outfit" was about "gone up." In fact, he looked,
and I have no doubt felt, slightly dismal       not to put too
fine a point upon it. But I give his opinion, as he gave
it to us; and the reader must take it cum grano salis       as
much or little as he chooses. In truth, we have a vast
region there, that as a whole is simply barren and worthless,
and that will never be utilized or seriously amount
to much, until the rest of the continent is well occupied
and settled up. We may, of course, regret it; but that
is about the truth of things, and emigrants thither soon
discover it.

Beyond Camp Cady, another rude post, much like Rock
Springs, we found a few ranches scattered here and there
along the Mojave; but they were importing grain and hay
fifty and a hundred miles, from San Bernardino and Los Angelos,
for sale to passing teams and travellers, which looked[Pg 422]
as if their prospects were not very flattering. There ought,
however, to be some good farms there, if the Mojave
were properly utilized; and doubtless this will be done
soon, if it has not been already.

At Cajon Pass, through the lofty Coast Range, you
quickly run down from five thousand feet above the sea,
to about one thousand feet at San Bernardino, or even
less. The descent is through a wild and picturesque
cañon, that almost equals in grandeur and sublimity the
far-famed Echo Cañon of Utah. We camped all night
near the foot of the Pass, sleeping so soundly that several
mounted deserters[24] from Fort Mojave passed us unheeded,
and the next morning, bright and early, we rolled
into San Bernardino. Here was a well-laid out and tolerably
built town, of a thousand or so inhabitants, with a
newspaper, telegraph, and most modern improvements.
It reminds one of Salt Lake City, and was, indeed, patterned
after that gem of the mountains, being settled
originally by the Mormons many years ago, when they
planned a route through here to the Pacific at San Diego.
We remained here but a few hours, and, as the weather
was already becoming warm, started the same evening for
Los Angelos, some sixty miles north, where we arrived
late next morning.

The country just now (April 26th), between Cajon
Pass and Los Angelos, was beautiful and glorious beyond
description. I scarcely know how to speak of it in fitting
terms, but I remember well how it impressed us at
the time. The Los Angelos Plains, seventy miles long by
thirty wide, were one wild sea of green and yellow, pink[Pg 423]
and violet       herbage and flowers everywhere. Thousands
of lusty cattle and contented sheep roamed over them
at will; but not one herd or flock, where there ought to
be a score or hundred. The vineyards were all putting
forth their leafy branches, and preparing for their purple
clusters. The fields were heavy with barley and wheat.
The olive and walnut orchards were clad in foliage of
densest green. The orange groves were everywhere
filling the air with their delicate and delicious fragrance,
so exquisitely sweet and ethereal it seemed as if distilled
from heaven. Ten thousand "beautiful birds of song"
flitted and twittered, from bush to tree, as we drove along.
On the west rolled the blue Pacific; on the east rose the
noble Coast Range; and over all, like a celestial benediction,
hung the California sky       a superb sapphire we
never see East. The setting sun lit up the distant hills,
as we gazed, and now clothed with crimson and gold       an
ineffable glory of splendors       the snow-clad peaks,
that towered to the north and east. Up there was the
frozen zone, most of the year round; but down on the
Plains, the balmy zephyrs of the tropics, and nature
literally one wild scene of beauty and of glory.

The transition from the Mojave Desert, and Arizona
generally, to this delightful region, was like coming into
Eden       seemed like "Paradise Regained," in very truth.
As we emerged from the mountains at Cajon Pass, and
drove down into it, we could scarcely refrain from shouting
for joy. Our animals whinnied, pricked up their
ears, and, jaded as they were, trotted along with a new-found
speed. Poor beasts, faithful donkeys, we had driven
some of them fully fifteen hundred miles, "outside" and
"inside," forth and back. Just to think of it once, plenty
of good water, fresh green grass, and a moist and fragrant
atmosphere once more! No more blazing sun; no[Pg 424]
more glaring sand; no more alkali streams; no more
thorny mesquite and prickly cactus; no more Apaches
and Hualapais, Pai-Utes and Chemehuevis; no more scanning
every bush and rock by day, and listening intently
to every sound by night; no more riding with rifles in
our hands, no more sleeping on our arms; no more
bottomless quicksands; no more fear of rattlesnakes
and centipedes; no more freshets, and no more sand-storms.
No! The long drag of fifteen hundred miles
was over, and once more we struck hands with civilization
and school-houses       touched steam-ships and telegraphs.

Verily, we had a right to sing "Out of the Wilderness,"
and "Home again," with infinite gusto; and it
is not surprising, that with these and other jolly airs
we did, indeed, make the welkin ring. Once more we
had the newspapers       we hadn't seen one in a month
before       that is, less than a month old       and to fair and
hospitable Los Angelos, ever and truly the City of the
Angels, we were welcomed as ones from the desert, if
not from the dead. We had, indeed, been reported
several times, as waylaid and captured by the Indians;
but here we were in propriis personis, brown and
hearty, though dusty and fatigued. Our good friend
Banning and Don Benito Wilson were among the first to
congratulate us; and their kindness and courtesy during
the next three days, and until we left by steamer for San
Francisco (April 30th), when shall we forget?



[Pg 425]




CHAPTER XXVII.

SAN FRANCISCO TO VIRGINIA CITY.


A sojourn of a fortnight or so, at San Francisco,
sufficed for rest and bringing up back Reports, and
on the evening of May 16th, we took the good boat,
Chrysopolis for Sacramento, and thence on to Virginia
City. There were posts in Nevada I was ordered to
inspect, and this was then the best route to reach them.
The weather was raw at San Francisco, but when we got
well up the bay and past Benicia, the air became mild
and June-like, and the evening was passed delightfully
on deck, under such star-lit skies as only California and
the Far West can boast. We had a full complement of
passengers, of all grades from New York cockneys to
Nevada miners; but the proportion of ladies was small,
as usually on the Coast. The few children aboard
seemed general pets, and many eagerly seized a moment's
chat with them. I saw a rough-looking miner, tall, and
"bearded like a pard," entice two of them to his side, and,
subsequently wander all over the boat with them, talking
with the little folks by the hour, about the machinery
and whatever else excited their curiosity. At supper, we
had a substantial and excellent meal; at bed-time, we
found the berths clean and sweet; and the conduct of
the boat in general was all that could be desired.

The Sacramento itself is a noble stream, of which[Pg 426]
any commonwealth might well be proud. To Benicia,
and beyond, it is navigable for first-class sea-going vessels,
and here upon the bold shores and by the deep waters
thereabouts, San Francisco ought really to have been
built, as elsewhere intimated. But, unfortunately, the
metropolis got itself camped down on the sand-hills, near
the Golden Gate, and now will remain there forever.

We reached Sacramento City, one hundred and
twenty miles from San Francisco, about 2 a. m. next day,
and after an early breakfast and a short walk through the
town, took the train at 6         a. m. for Cisco, then the
advance station on the Central Pacific Railroad. This
ride, of about a hundred miles, was first up the rich
valley of the Sacramento, and then through the foot-hills,
and up the Sierra Nevadas. At Sacramento the river
was still broad and deep, but with low banks that necessitated
levees to guard against overflows. Once a clear
mountain stream, fresh from the Sierras, it was now
tawnier than the yellow Tiber, with the results of mining
on its head-waters and tributaries, and, it was reported,
was steadily filling up. Sacramento, indeed, may well
have an eye to this; but what she can do to correct or
prevent it, it seems difficult to say.

As we advanced, the valley of the Sacramento steadily
narrowed, but everywhere appeared rich and fertile.
Broad farms stretched out on every side, and clumps of
live-oaks, with their deep green foliage, everywhere
relieved the golden yellow of the ripening wheat-fields.
The general lack of timber continued noticeable, but
these scattered live-oaks, sturdy and defiant, relieved the
landscape, and they seemed preserved with commendable
care. As we approached the foot-hills, the soil grew
thinner, the lordly wheat-fields gave place to extensive
vineyards, and soon the dense pines of the Sierras made[Pg 427]
their appearance. Here, too, we struck the mines, and
on all sides saw evidences of the spade and rocker. In
many places, there were only old placers abandoned, with
the hills ragged and torn, and the earth generally topsy-turvy
with past operations       cabins empty, ditches dry,
sluice-ways falling to pieces; but, in others, the washings
were still in full operation, and the hills and streams
seemed alive with human industry and energy. Little
mining hamlets were perched, here and there, on the edge
of mountain torrents; and, where the water did not suffice,
broad ditches, improvised for the locality, brought it from
some far-off point and carried it wheresoever wanted.

Some of these water-ditches are among the wonders
of the Pacific Coast, and deserve more than a passing
notice. With surprising engineering, they wind down
and around and among the mountains, leaping ravines,
crossing ridges, and everywhere following the miner,
like faithful servants of his will. Wherever necessary,
the miner taps them, and either uses the water in his
ordinary sluice-way, or else by his hydraulic pipes
hurls it against the hills, and literally washes them to
the plain. This hydraulic mining seemed to be most in
favor there, and the power developed by some of these
streams was immense. The momentum acquired by the
water in its long descent, sufficed to melt huge hills of
clay and gravel very quickly; and instances were reported
where men, and mules even, had been killed by being
struck by the water, as it issued from the pipes or hose.
The men engaged in mining were rough and hirsute, as
miners everywhere are; but they looked bright and keen,
and as if they believed in California and her future, come
what might.

The change in the climate, as we plunged into the
foot-hills, and felt our way up into the Sierras, was[Pg 428]
very apparent, and soon became disagreeably so. At
Sacramento, the weather was close and warm; but hour
by hour, as we ascended, the thermometer went down,
and long before reaching Cisco, only about a hundred
miles or so, we were shivering in winter garments. As
I have said, this was then the "jumping off" place or terminus
of the Central Pacific road, and is well up into the
mountains. We reached there soon after noon, and I must
say were surprised at the general excellence, as well as
audacity of the road. Some of its grades are over a
hundred feet to the mile,[25] and in many places it literally
springs into the air, over immense trestle-work bridges
or along the dizzy edge of precipices, that seem fraught
with peril and destruction; but we reached Cisco safe
and sound, and sat down to a smoking dinner, with the
snow-drifts still up to the eaves of the roofs of the hotel,
and the houses round-about.

Cisco was then a scattered village, of frame tenements,
only a few months old; but as the terminus of the road,
and depot of supplies for all Nevada, it was bustling with
business. The Overland Mail, for Virginia City and the
East, left here daily, on the arrival of the train; and, after
a hurried dinner, we were off again with the mail. It was
now May 17th, and though the advancing summer had
melted the snow in the regular roadway, so that wagoning
was practicable for some distance, yet the old snow still lay
six and eight feet deep on the general level, and our road
ran between solid walls of it. We set off from Cisco in[Pg 429]
stage-coaches (mountain mud-wagons), but soon had to
surrender these for sleighs; and then came a long and
dreary pull, through slush and mud and ice, for several
miles, till we got well across the summit of the Sierras,
when we again took coaches and rattled down to Donner
Lake, where we arrived at 8         p. m., having made only
eighteen miles since noon. The most of us walked a
good part of the way, and found it altogether rather a
fatiguing march. The depth of the snow still left on the
summit seemed surprising; but a gentleman I met in
San Francisco assured me, that when he crossed the
Sierras in December previous, he found the telegraph
poles, even, in many places snowed under. The stage-people
reported the snow as having been fifteen and
twenty feet in depth on the level generally, and we could
see where they had set up poles and "shakes" long before,
to mark out the general course of the road itself.

It was these huge vast snows that the Central Pacific
folks had mainly to provide against, and the problem
would have appalled most men. But they quietly set to
work to board the snows out, and since then have literally
housed their road in for thirty miles or more. The
surrounding forests furnished them cheap timber, and
portable saw-mills shifted from point to point soon converted
this into the required lumber. But what a
herculean job it really was! These great snow-sheds or
snow-galleries consumed in all nearly forty-five million
feet, board measure, of sawed timber, and over a million
and a quarter feet of round timber, equivalent in the
aggregate to fifty-two and a half million feet, board
measure, of sawed timber; and nearly a thousand tons
of iron and spikes. Two general styles of construction
were adopted       one intended for localities where the
weight of the snow only had to be supported, and the[Pg 430]
other for such places as were exposed to "slides," and
the slower but almost irresistible "glacial movement" of
the snow, as on the steep and rocky slopes near the summit.
These galleries have proved a great success, and
though frequently covered with drifted snow to a depth
of ten or twenty feet, and in some places of more than
fifty feet, they afford a safe passage for trains at all
seasons, without noticeable detentions.

Near the summit, we came upon John Chinaman
again, in all his glory. Here was the "Heathen Chinee,"
five thousand strong, burrowing and tunnelling a way
for the road, through the back-bone of the Sierras. It
was a huge piece of work, nearly half a mile long, through
the solid granite; but John was patiently pegging away
at it, from four different faces, and soon afterwards completed
it successfully. They all wore their pig-tails, the
same as in San Francisco, but usually had these sacred
appendages twisted well around their heads, instead of
dangling at their heels; and, with the exception of the
universal blue blouse, were dressed like ordinary navvies
or laborers. Of course, they had American or English
superintendents and foremen of gangs; but these all
spoke well of the almond-eyed strangers, and praised
them, especially, for their docility and intelligence. A
more industrious or orderly set of workingmen, were never
seen; and though railroad-building was a new employment
for Asiatics, they seemed to take to it very kindly.
Subsequently, they pushed the Central down the mountains,
and through to Ogden City; and the day is not
distant, when they will push such roads, with their
thousand civilizing influences, all through the Flowery
Kingdom.

We crossed the summit just at sunset, and from that
proud altitude       seven thousand two hundred feet above[Pg 431]
the sea       gazed down upon that gem of the Sierras, Donner
Lake       a body of crystalline water, five miles long by
over half a mile wide, in the very heart of the mountains.
The crest of the Sierras lifts itself boldly along the west,
but elsewhere the ridges slope down to the Lake, and the
hoary peaks and cliffs seem to hold it in their lap, like a
sleeping infant. The sunset itself, that evening, was
superb. The clouds became gold, the snow burnished silver,
while a purple haze sifted down from the sky, and
soon veiled exquisitely the lake and its far-stretching
cañons. As the night gathered deeper, the lights and
shadows became grandly sublime; and then, as a fitting
sequel, came one of those glorious skies, ablaze with stars,
for which the Coast is so famed. It was blackest marble,
gemmed with silver. It seemed to uplift itself into
eternity. The whole scene fixed itself indelibly in the
memory, and though we saw Lake Tahoe afterwards I
preferred this view of Donner Lake.

In the midst of the falling shadows, we passed the
snow-limit, and again betook ourselves to mountain mud-wagons,
which farther down we again exchanged for
Concord coaches. About 9 p. m. we halted for supper,
but were soon on the road again, and striking the
Truckee, followed it down until long after sunrise.
Once out of the mountains, its valley rapidly broadened;
but here was the rainless region, and sage-brush again
prevailed, as in Idaho and Arizona. Here and there, we
passed some fair farms; but irrigation was the secret,
and without this, agriculture in Nevada, as elsewhere
in the great basin of the continent, will seldom amount
to much. The air continued raw and chilly, well
into the morning; but the roads had become dusty
and superb, and we bowled along down the mountains,
and up the wonderful Geiger grade, at a swinging pace,[Pg 432]
that brought us into Virginia City       seventy miles or
more from Cisco       at about 10 a. m. Here we stopped at
the International, then the "swell" house of Virginia
City, and found excellent cheer, for the hungry and the
weary.

The next day was Sunday, and though many of the
business houses continued open, yet the mines and mills
as a rule were silent, and the proportion of church-goers
was larger than we expected. Virginia already boasted
several creditable churches, and in one of these a noted
revivalist from the East (Rev. Mr. E.) was attracting
crowds by his zeal and earnestness. His discourse that
day was bald to plainness, but direct and searching; and
when, at its close, he invited penitents to rise, a score or
more stood up       many of them rough and burly men,
bathed in tears. He had crossed our path in Oregon in
December, and subsequently we had heard of him again
in San Francisco, where the press were divided as to his
merits. But here in Nevada, he was regarded as a great
evangelist, and one enthusiastic journalist asserted that
he had added more to the church, during his brief tour
on the Coast, than all their parsons before all put together.
Some days after, when about to depart for other fields,
he was presented with a silver "brick" or two, as appropriate
evidence of Nevada appreciation.

As a mining town, Virginia City impresses one very
favorably, and her growth seemed steady and real. She
already possessed many excellent buildings, and others
were fast going up. She sits high and dry, on the side
of a silver mountain, six thousand feet above the sea,
with a population of some eight or ten thousand souls,
with other mountains shouldering away beneath and
above her; and, of course, would never have been at all,
had it not been for the lucky discovery of the Comstock[Pg 433]
Lode. This is the great lode of Nevada, from which the
bulk of her silver has been taken, and few of her mining
operations elsewhere were then paying for themselves.
White Pine had not then been discovered (May, '67), and
the great enterprises of Nevada, such as Gould       Curry,
Yellow Jacket, Ophir, Savage, Crown Point, etc., were all
located on the Comstock Lode. This ran along the mountain-side,
beneath the town, for two or three miles, varying
in width from fifty to one hundred feet, and of unknown
depth. The Gould       Curry Company had sunk a shaft
nearly a thousand feet, and the argentiferous deposits
still appeared, more or less richly. Less than a third of
the companies then at work on this great lode, however
(some thirty in all), were then paying dividends, and the
general product of the State, it was conceded, was falling
off. One company had spent over a million dollars, in
"developing" its property, without striking "pay-ore,"
and others were following in its footsteps. But others,
again, had paid very handsomely. The Gould       Curry,
on an investment of less than two hundred thousand
dollars from its stockholders, had paid them back four
millions in dividends, and altogether had produced over
twelve millions in bullion. In one year, it had yielded
nearly five millions, with a clear profit of over one
million; but in 1867, it was not promising so well. It
had spent vast sums in mining and improvements, with
something here and there that looked like extravagance,
if not worse. Its magnificent mill, of eighty-stamp
power, cost over a million of dollars, and was said to be
the largest and finest quartz-mill in the world. This
company owned twelve hundred feet of the Comstock
Lode, and had dug down nearly a thousand feet in depth,
and back and forth fifty times. Its shafts and tunnels
measured over two miles under ground, and it had used[Pg 434]
more lumber in strengthing its walls, it was said, than
was embraced in the whole of Virginia City overhead.
We spent an afternoon wandering through its drifts and
galleries, part of the time nine hundred and fifty feet
beneath the surface, and were amazed at the work that
had been done.

Another, the Yellow Jacket, had yielded over two
millions of dollars, and paid its stock-holders nearly
four hundred thousand dollars, or fifty thousand more
than all their subscriptions and assessments. The
Savage had taken out six millions of bullion, and the
Ophir over twelve millions; but, as yet, the stockholders
had realized but little, because of bad management
and expensive experiments, that proved failures.
This Comstock ore averaged less than forty dollars per
ton, more usually only twenty-five to thirty; but it was
less refractory than most American ores, and required
only to be crushed and amalgamated to extract the bullion.
Better "processes" were continually being looked for, as
in Colorado, with which it was hoped much poorer ores
would pay well. Selected ores, such as averaged a thousand
dollars per ton or so, were still shipped to Swansea,
Wales, for treatment, though this seemed absurd, considering
the distance and expense, and our vast deposits
of coal at home. The famous Sutro Tunnel, in behalf
of which Congress has since been so earnestly memorialized,
is a magnificent scheme to tap this great lode at
lower levels, where it may be drained and worked at
much better advantage; and, if ever realized, will no
doubt result in the Comstock turning out fabulous sums
again.[26]

The most of the mining capital seemed to be furnished
by California, and the best-informed people[Pg 435]
thought, notwithstanding the large yield of many mines,
that she had not yet received back the amount of money
she had actually invested. A fair estimate was, that she
had put fully a hundred millions into Nevada mines and
mills, and had taken out only about sixty millions, leaving
a balance of forty millions on the wrong side of the
ledger yet; but then there were the shafts and tunnels,
the mills and machinery, with large added experience,
and 'Frisco capitalists were still hopeful of the future.

The fluctuations of mining stocks were great and frequent,
and we watched them with interest while on the
Coast. A lucky "strike," probably in some rich "pocket,"
would send Savage or Yellow Jacket high up·on the list
for a few days or weeks, when the vein would "peter
out," and again it would drop to its former figures or
below. Our conclusion was, that silver-mining, after all,
is a very risky business. There may be money in it, for
superintendents and directors; but for stockholders, as a
rule, very little. The Mexicans have an adage, and they
are old and experienced miners, that "it takes a mine
to work a mine;" and that seemed to be about the
opinion of the best minds we met with. Miners and
mining-life, are much the same everywhere; and if the
reader wants to know more about them, let him turn to
Chapter V., p. 58.



[Pg 436]




CHAPTER XXVIII.

VIRGINIA CITY TO STOCKTON.


After concluding my duties at Fort Churchill,
some thirty miles east on the road to Austin, we
returned again to Virginia City, and on the morning of
May 22d took the coach for California again. As we
had come over by Cisco and Donner Lake, we decided
to return by Lake Tahoe and Placerville, and thus see as
much of the country both ways as possible. Our route
lay first through Carson City and Genoa, and thence
across the Sierras by Lake Tahoe to Placerville. The
sun shone clear, but cool, as we swung out of the Silver
City, amidst rolling clouds of dust; but when we
reached the grease-wood and sage plains, it speedily grew
warmer. We found Carson a diminutive "city," noted
chiefly for its penitentiary, and pushed rapidly ahead
all day. We threaded the valley of the Carson, and
striking the Sierras skirted their base for miles; but
finally turned square west, and zigzagged over the first
range, by a splendid turnpike, that is unsurpassed anywhere.
The range was so abrupt, and the road so sharp,
that the summit seemed higher than it really was; but
when we reached there, we were repaid by a magnificent
view of the valley of the Carson, and the far-stretching
sage and alkali plains of Nevada. So far, we had
encountered no snow; but when we approached the
second range, or Mother Ridge of the Sierras, we found[Pg 437]
it snow-crowned still, and prepared ourselves for the
worst.

At Yank's Station, where we changed horses just at
nightfall, they reported the road ahead as not good enough
for sleighs, and too bad for coaches; but concluded,
on the whole, we had better risk a coach. So, after a
hearty supper, we set off in a Concord coach, being the
first one over the Placerville route that spring. We had
a full load       nine passengers inside and four outside, including
two ladies and three children; but our six horses
were fresh and gamey, and for a time we swung along
at a spanking pace. Halfway up the range, however,
we struck the ice and slush, and soon came to a dead
halt, with a request from the driver for all to get out and
walk, except the ladies and children. With only these
on board, the coach forged ahead for a mile or so more,
when again it halted, and these, too, were ordered out.
Two of the children were small, only four or five years
of age, and these the rest of the passengers chivalrously
agreed to shoulder and carry by turns. The road was
itself quite steep; its bed, mingled ice and slush; while
on either side were still four or five feet of snow,
as on the Donner Lake route. It ascended the range
by long zigzags, and some who attempted a "short cut"
across these, trusting the snow, soon found themselves
up to their waists or shoulders in it. It was slow and
painful travelling at best, especially with a child on your
back; but the coach progressed still slower, and often
we heard it floundering along far below us, or wholly
stalled in some villainous chuck-hole, worse than the rest.

Reaching the summit at last, near midnight, by such
long and toilsome climbing, we there found a rough
station, where we dried our feet and clothes, and got
fresh horses, after which we pushed on again       now,[Pg 438]
however, sticking by the coach, and helping to lift it
out, and urge it along from time to time as needed.
Sometimes, it seemed hopelessly stalled, especially when
it got wedged in, besides, against one of the snow-walls;
but by lifting and prying, and much faithful shouting,
we always managed somehow to pull out, and at last
struck terra firma again along toward morning. But we
were six mortal hours, in making less than ten miles,
across this range; and what with trudging through the
slush, helping the ladies forward, and carrying the children,
it was altogether one of the worst night-journeys I
ever experienced. If anybody thinks differently, let
him try his hand at carrying fifty pounds of childhood,
up a slushy road, six miles more or less across a mountain,
through the chilly night air, about midnight and after.
When happily we regained the coach, after passing the
snow, we supposed our troubles about over; but an
ambitious mother from Virginia City, en route to San
Francisco, left her Gertrude Jane unselfishly to me,
while she herself sank gracefully into a corner of the
coach, and went deliberately to sleep. It was, perhaps,
characteristic of her sex on the Coast, where women are
so few, they are over-appreciated; but to the Eastern
mind, I confess, it seemed somewhat too much of a good
thing, considering the premises.

Once out of the snow, we struck comparatively good
roads again, and whirled along down and out of the
mountains at a magnificent rate. Our general pace was
a good square trot, but we swung around the zigzags
usually at a sharp gallop, and often shaved the edge of
cliffs so closely, that it made the goose-flesh come and go,
or one's hair about stand on end. With the first break
of day, I sought the outside of the coach, and revelled
in the ride through the breezy pines of the Sierras       monster[Pg 439]
coniferæ, ten and twelve feet through, and running
up straight as an arrow by the hundred feet       and
so down the range to Lake Tahoe. This (Tahoe) is the
gem of the Sierras, par excellence, according to all good
Californians; and one scarcely wonders at their immense
pride in it. Itself six thousand feet above the sea,
skirted with primeval forests, rimmed about with snow-clad
peaks, it stretches wide for ten or twelve miles, and
its waters are so pure and clear, that trout may be seen at
all depths in it. It had already become a popular resort
for all the Pacific Coast, and waited only for the completion
of the railroad, to welcome visitors from the
East. Here was the limpid heart of the Sierras; and the
wild, the picturesque, and the sublime, all combined to
enhance its conceded beauty. California herself, ever
alive to her own interests, was also entertaining some very
utilitarian views with regard to it. A long-headed,
broad-minded German engineer proposed to tap it, by
tunnelling through the Sierras, and conducting its crystal
waters across the State       first utilizing them as water-power
and a grand irrigating canal en route as wanted,
and at the terminus supplying San Francisco with unimpeachable
water. It was a gigantic project, involving
many millions; but was already much talked of, and was
just the kind of scheme to interest the minds, and lighten
the pockets, of good Californians.

Past Lake Tahoe, we whirled over and down the
mountains at a telling pace       by the side of rushing
torrents, amidst aromatic pines, along the dizzy edge of
precipices       it was the very romance of stage-coaching       and
drew up at Shingle Station, on the Placerville and
Sacramento Railroad, at 11 a. m., having come 116 miles
since leaving Virginia City, only the day before, despite
the snow on the summit. At Placerville, we struck the[Pg 440]
original gold-fields of California, and saw abundant
evidences of past washings on all sides of us. These
were now mostly abandoned, except by the Chinese,
who here and there were still patiently at work, content
to glean what Americans despised. Placerville itself, in
the then early spring, was one mass of perfect roses and
foliage. The balmy breath of summer seemed everywhere
at work, and the climate reminded one rather of
Charleston or Savannah in May or June. Her ragged
hillsides, abandoned by the miner, were everywhere
changing into vineyards and orchards, while skillful
irrigation was rapidly converting her waste lands into
productive farms. Once out of the foot-hills, we again
struck the lordly wheat-fields, and thence on to Sacramento
we were never out of sight of broad acres of
waving grain.

At Sacramento, we found hearty welcome, and good
hotels, and tarried there for a day or so. It was then a
city of fifteen or twenty thousand people, and though not
prospering as in former years, as capital of the State and
the centre of a magnificent farming district, was yet certain
of its future. Here, as at Placerville, the wealth
of roses was something surprising, and indeed the whole
city seemed to be a wilderness of color and perfume. It
is difficult for one residing on the Atlantic slope, to realize
how richly California is endowed with flowers. To
us, here, they were a constant wonder and delight,
though this may have partly come from our sudden
transition from the snows of the Sierras.

From Sacramento, we rode over to Stockton, some
fifty miles, leaving at 6 a. m. and reaching there at 1 p. m.
As there were but few passengers, we had the coach
pretty much to ourselves, and the ride proved delightful,
barring the dust. Our route lay mainly down the valley[Pg 441]
of the Sacramento proper, and we found the country a
dead level or gently rolling, not unlike an Illinois prairie,
though diversified here and there with groups of live-oaks,
festooned with Spanish moss. Now and then these
oaks thickened into respectable groves, but nowhere did
they seem to amount to much as timber. The soil was
everywhere black and deep, all a farmer's heart could
wish, and there appeared to be literally no end to the
wide-stretching wheat-fields. They skirted the road for
miles, on every side, and our driver was continually
pointing out to us this hundred or that thousand acre
wheat-field. Wheat seemed too much their main crop,
though vineyards and fruit-orchards were not infrequent,
and on the "divides" we here and there saw some large
flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, quietly feeding under
their native rancheros. Evidently their breadth of wheatland
was constantly extending. When California first
began to grow wheat, for several years it was thought
the bottom-lands were the only ones worth cultivating.
But it was found that good crops could also be grown
on her uplands, and year by year more of these were
now being reclaimed and sown. Unlike other crops, her
wheat nowhere requires irrigation; but, sown late in the
fall or early winter, it germinates beneath the December
rains, grows rapidly all winter, and by May is ready to
harvest. Her long and rainless summer affords ample
leisure to gather and market it       no granaries or barns
being required; and the reported yield       50 to 80 bushels
to the acre       seems fabulous to any one, but a Californian.

Her fruit and vegetable fields require regular irrigation,
the same as in Colorado and Utah; and wherever
these appeared, long-armed windmills wearily beat the
air, pumping water to the surface. The steady sea-breeze
of the long summer renders these very reliable,[Pg 442]
and California everywhere had been quick to adopt them.
All about Stockton, they stood gaunt and skeleton-like
against the sky, like a cordon of ghostly sentinels; but
they seemed to serve their purpose admirably well, and
this was the main thing. The water they lifted to the
surface was conducted by troughs and ditches hundreds
of yards away, as needed, everywhere converting the
parched and arid earth into bountiful fields and gardens.
Stockton seemed literally embosomed in these, foliage
and flowers abounding on all sides, and her climate
appeared perfect even for California. At the head of
steamboat navigation on the San Joaquin, she gathered
into her lap the trade and travel of a wide district there,
and was already a busy and thriving town of several
thousand inhabitants. Of course, she has no great and
magnificent future, like San Francisco; but as an important
inland city, doubtless she will continue to grow and
prosper for many years to come.


   
   
   YOSEMITE VALLEY (from foot of Mariposa Trail).




[Pg 443]




CHAPTER XXIX.

STOCKTON TO THE YOSEMITE.


Here at Stockton, I had expected to find friends
from San Francisco, to go through to the Yosemite
with me, and return. (Yo-Sem-i-te, big-grizzly bear.)
But, instead, I found letters, begging off, on the plea,
that it was yet too early in the season to venture there.
It was, indeed, rather later than usual; but the previous
winter had been a severe one, and in San Francisco, they
said, the snow was still too deep on the mountains, to
reach the far-famed valley. This was all very well for
them, being residents on the Coast. But my official duties
there were now substantially over; there was only about
a fortnight or so left, before the steamer sailed on which
I had engaged passage; and the question with me was,
whether now, or perhaps never, to see California's (if
not the world's) chiefest wonder. I inquired at the
Stockton hotels, but could find no one en route to the
Yosemite; and finally concluded I must go alone, or not
at all.[27] At last, however, I heard of two Englishmen
who had just returned, declaring the route practicable
via Coulterville; but alleging they were the only ones,
who had been in and out that season. This decided me,[Pg 444]
especially as I preferred to be on the move, rather than
idling in San Francisco until my steamer sailed.

Accordingly, I took the stage early next morning
(May 25th) for Coulterville, and reached there the same
evening. My design was to go in by the Coulterville
route, and come out by the Mariposa, so as to visit the
Mariposa Grove of Big Trees also, if possible; but, failing
that, to return by Coulterville. The first twenty-five
miles of the road from Stockton was through a sea of
lordly wheat-fields, like the ride from Sacramento; but,
after that we struck the more barren foot-hills, and
settlements soon became fewer and poorer. Our general
course was up the valley of the San Joaquin and its
tributaries       the Stanislaus and the Tuolomne       with the
country gradually rising, and the Coast Range looming
always grandly against the west. The latter half of the
way was dreary and desolate, the arid hills and plains
stretching on all sides around; and we hailed with joy
the lovely view of the Merced Valley, that betokened
our approach to Coulterville. We had several passengers
thus far, evidently men intent on mines or other local
business, and Coulterville gave us a kindly evening
welcome.

The next morning a guide was found, who guaranteed
to take me into the valley and back, if I could
stand a little rough riding and walking; and after an
early dinner we set cheerily out. He could not promise
to bring me out by the Mariposa trail, but he would
do the best he could, and in this I had faith. The distance
to the Yosemite was still some fifty-five miles, too
much for one day's journey, and we decided to go no farther
than Black's, some eighteen miles on, the first day.
The wagon-road terminated practically at Coulterville,
and from here we proceeded on horseback, over a wandering[Pg 445]
mountain trail, that seemed specially designed to
bring out all the finest views in the country. My horse
was a mustang pony, named Punty, small but sure of
foot, and as brave and faithful a little creature as ever
lived. The day was glorious. The sky was without a
cloud. The atmosphere seemed, indeed, like "wine of
airy gold." The pines of the foot-hills and mountains
perfumed every breeze, and every sense seemed satisfied
and full. As we had ample time, we allowed our horses
to take their "own sweet will," and whiled the afternoon
away in chat and song. My guide, Capt. Coulter, was a
companionable young fellow, who had seen something
of army life among the California Volunteers, and we
got on together very well.

At Bower Cave, halfway or so along, we halted to
give the horses a brief rest, and meanwhile explored
the little bijou of a cave there, which is quite perfect
in its way. It is a natural cave, several hundred feet in
extent, in a limestone bluff there, with a pool of water
in one corner, forty feet deep, and clear as crystal. At
the bottom of the cave are several petrified trees, while
from its mouth uprises a group of stately maples, that
spread their umbrageous branches like a canopy over all.
At a little distance, they quite conceal the entrance to
the cave; but down in the cave, looking up, the light
breaks through their multitudinous leaves, and illuminates
the cave and pool to the very bottom. Thence, we proceeded
on to Black's, in a sheltered nook, well among
the mountains, where we found plain but excellent
entertainment, and went early to bed, with the roses
crowding about our windows, and the irrigating streams
that gave life to them murmuring in our ears. Here, as
elsewhere in California, irrigation was still essential; but
Mr. Black had caught and tamed a mountain rivulet       led[Pg 446]
it indeed everywhere       and wherever it went, it worked
wonders, in that virgin soil and matchless climate.

The next morning, we were up bright and early,
though withal a little stiff and sore, and at 6 a. m. were
off for the Yosemite again. Like the day before, only
hourly more and more so, the trail still wound up, and
along, and over the ridges and mountains       now through
deep forests of primeval pines, that would be monsters
anywhere else, where our horses sank to their fetlocks in
mosses of emerald green, and now along some rocky
bluff, naked and barren, whence we could gaze for miles
on miles across ravine and ridge, wooded mountain and
arid plain, to the purple Coast Range beyond. Often I
reined Punty in, and gazed with delighted eyes over such
glorious scenes and far-away landscapes, as we are never
permitted to see East. There was a purity and clearness
about the air, that lent long range to the vision; and
besides, our elevation above the sea had now become so
great, that the foot-hills seemed merged into the plains.
At times, there came a feeling of loneliness       only two of
us thus together, adrift among the Sierras; but the ever-changing
landscape soon banished this again, and throughout
the day every sense seemed filled to the utmost.
This magnificent horseback ride, through the foot-hills
and up the Sierras, over and along their flanks and summits,
alone repaid me for all the toil and fatigue of the
trip; and then, there was the Yosemite, and other experiences
besides.

When we got within five or six miles of the Yosemite,
however, we struck the snow, and the remainder of
our ride became chiefly a plunge and flounder. The
snow still lay several feet in depth, over most of this distance,
completely hiding the trail in many places, so that
my guide frequently became lost. A pocket-compass,[Pg 447]
and his own keen eye for topography, however, usually
soon put us right again, and so we floundered on       determined
to get through, if possible. In places, the snow had
a stout crust, which bore both us and the horses up, and
here we would mount and ride along quite gayly. But,
in an unguarded moment, when we were thinking the
worst was over, or that we were almost out of the snow-limit,
suddenly our mustangs would go in to their saddle-girths;
and then, there was nothing left for us but to dismount
(if we were not already sprawling in the snow), and
coax them forward the best we could. This kind of travelling
told quickly upon our animals, and severely; however,
we got along better than we expected, and late in the
afternoon, emerging from the snow and pines, we rounded
a rocky bluff, and before us in a moment       yawned the
Yosemite. At our feet lay the wonderful valley       how
sublime and glorious! Before us swayed the Bridal Veil,
in all its grace and beauty. To the left was El Capitan,
looming up in solemn grandeur. Beyond stood Sentinel
Peak, piercing the clouds; and still beyond, the great
South Dome, propping the very sky. We reined our
horses in for a while, feasting our eyes on the general
view; but soon hastened on again, as the day was waning,
and the descent into the valley yet to be accomplished.

Soon we struck a brace of foaming torrents, that shot
across our pathway like feathery arrows, and sped to join
the lovely Merced in the far valley below. Ordinarily,
these were but mountain rivulets; but now they were
fierce and swollen, because of the melting snows, and as
they were unbridged, the only way was to ford them.
We tried the usual ford, but found it so deep and swift,
and rocky withal, that we were afraid to venture it.
Finally, Capt. Coulter suggested, that if I would cross by
some fallen trees farther up, that nearly met and made a[Pg 448]
sort of foot-bridge there, he thought he could make Punty
swim the streams, swollen and rocky as they were, when
the other horse would be likely to follow suit. So, taking
off his saddle and bridle, and shouldering these and my
roll of blankets, I cautiously made my way over the
tangled trees, and presently succeeded in reaching the
other side in safety. From here, I called to Punty to
come over, while Capt. C. urged him in. At first, he
whinnied, as if he knew what was wanted of him; then
ventured into the icy water, and shrank out again, as if
uncertain of himself. But, finally, with more coaxing
and urging, the plucky little fellow plunged courageously
in, and though the current bore him considerably down,
and the rocks bruised him cruelly, at length he reached
my side in safety. He walked up to me, a wet and
dripping thing, but eager for the biscuit with which I
rewarded him; and, as he munched it, rubbed his nose
familiarly against my shoulder, as if to testify his goodwill.
An exchange of whinnies, now, soon brought the
other horse over, after a little urging; and Capt. C. crossing
also by the trees, we quickly saddled up, and were off
again. A long and rather perilous descent, over a rocky
and precipitous trail, not yet repaired after the spring
washings, brought us at last down into the valley; and
soon after 6 p. m. we reached Hutchings'. In truth, it
was a hard day's ride, after all. We had been twelve
hours in the saddle, first and last; but had come thirty-seven
miles, over an ugly road, and were the first
Americans of the season in the Yosemite.

Here, at Hutchings', I spent three days in the Yosemite;
but scarcely know where to begin, or how to speak
about it. They were all perfect days in point of weather,
and with Mr. Hutchings usually as guide, I made the
most of them. He was then one of the only two settlers[Pg 449]
in the Yosemite, and his house the only real place of
entertainment there. An artist and an author himself of
considerable merit, more than a man of business, he had
chosen the Yosemite out of all the Pacific Coast, as the
best place to live and die in; and was content to be shut
up here, from October to June of each year, without even
a newspaper or a word from the outside world, during
that period. From June to the last of September, he
always had more or less company, the influx of sightseers
being pretty steady and constant; but, after that, the
snows interfered with travel, and with his family he
hibernated there the rest of the year. With rare taste
for the picturesque and the sublime, he had located his
house       only a rough shanty then, but meant to grow into
something better       in the very heart of the valley, with
huge and massive El Capitan in front, the incomparable
Yosemite Falls to the right, and the spire-like Sentinel
Peak just off to the left. Standing on his lawn, you take
all these grand and majestic features in at one view, and
at the same time obtain a general view of the valley from
there, I think, unsurpassed elsewhere down in it.

The first day, we took horses and rambled leisurely
through the valley, crossing and recrossing from side to
side, as the views were finest; and, much as had been anticipated,
I confess, I was overwhelmed with admiration
and delight. The valley itself, running about east and
west, is some five miles long by a half-mile wide, and
seems to be a fissure or crevice in the heart of the Sierras
there; or rather, as if the bottom had here dropped out of
the mountains, and the lofty Sierras had sunk to a level
with the plain. The sharp, almost perpendicular, sides of
the valley give you this impression further, and it is hard
to account for its features otherwise, though some claim
it all as the work of erosion, like the glen at Watkins, or[Pg 450]
the gorge at Niagara. Its walls are often quite perpendicular,
half a mile or more in height; and its wonderful
South Dome, rearing its crest six thousand four hundred
feet above the level of the valley, or a mile and a quarter
high, seems split half in two, as if one half had suddenly
disappeared, with its northern face so sharp, that a stone
dropped from its edge would fall to the bottom without
striking. This had never yet been ascended, and probably
never will be       its remaining half-dome is so smooth
and globular.

The general color of the walls is a grayish yellow, but
here and there they are mottled with green and black;
and usually in every niche and crevice, where a tree can
gain a foothold, great spruces and pines grow luxuriantly.
In many places, however, its walls stand sheer and bare,
great masses of honest granite, from half a mile to a mile
perpendicularly; and, perhaps, I can't give a better
impression of them, than by saying, that if either of them
was toppled over, in many instances it would fill the
valley and more. Up above, on the summit of the range,
snow lies more or less the year round; but down below,
in the heart of the valley, you have the general climate
of California outside, but without its aridity, for here
showers prevail in summer, as in the East. When I was
there, the snow still lay five and six feet deep on top of
the walls and domes; but below, the valley was a June
meadow, rich with herbage, with groves of pine and fir
scattered here and there, shooting up two and three
hundred feet into the air, but dwarfed into saplings
apparently by the majestic walls. Birch, willow, and
dogwood lined the streams; the primrose, violet, and
other early flowers dotted the lawns; the bluebird, the
robin, and the bobolink       

[Pg 451]


"June's bridesman, poet o' the year,
Gladness on wings       "


twittered among the trees; and on every side, wherever
we walked or rode, the wild strawberries were ripening
in the grass, and perfuming the breeze.

Here and there, plunging over the lofty walls, were
waterfalls of surpassing beauty, some a mere line of mist,
tossed hither and yon by the passing wind, like a veil of
gauze, and others thundering down with a voice approaching
even Niagara's. Later in the season, when the snows
measurably disappear, these falls of course become much
shrunken in size, and visitors behold them then shorn in
part of their beauty and sublimity. But just then, so
early in the season, they gave one full greeting, and I
counted a score or more from different points thundering
in chorus. We rode to the foot of the Bridal Veil,
usually a sheet of misty gauze, but now a roaring cataract,
and gazed up nine hundred feet, to where it leaped
from the southern wall. Then we crossed to El Capitan,
a massive bastion or angle in the northern wall, of solid
granite, rising sheer into the air for three-quarters of a
mile without a break, except a niche one-third of the
way up, where a tall fir has gained a foothold, and will
never be molested by hand of man. Thence, we turned
and rode up the valley, to where the Yosemite Fall
plunged boldly out from the northern wall, like a thing
of life, and thundered headlong down twenty-six hundred
feet, or fifteen times the height of Niagara. Above,
where it leaped from the cliff, and afterwards, it seemed
a goodly river; but long before it reached the bottom,
it became a column of mist, which the wind swayed to
and fro at will, but whose thunder yet shook the valley.
From there, we rode back to Hutchings'; and that night,
when the moon rose and from a cloudless sky flooded the[Pg 452]
valley with her silver light, Nature seemed to be endeavoring
to out-do herself in our behalf.

The next day, we rode up the Merced River, which
winds through the valley and drains it       a stream ten or
twelve feet deep by twice as many yards in width, so pure
and clear you may everywhere count the pebbles at the
bottom       to the Lake, and Domes. The former is a small
sheet of water, of wonderful clearness, that reflects the
surrounding mountains and falls, like a mirror; the latter
are dome-like masses of naked rock, peculiar to the
Coast scenery, crowning the Sierras just there. Of the
South Dome, I have already spoken; the North Dome
is inferior in size and height, but is complete as a dome,
and wonderful to behold. A dozen such domes as crown
the capitol at Washington could readily be put inside
of it, and there would be room for several more. From
here, turning an angle of the South Dome, we caught a
superb view of the South Fork of the Merced, as it came
tumbling over the mountain wall, a mile or more away,
an unbroken mass of foam. At that distance, it seemed a
sheet of fleecy whiteness       purest lamb's wool       hundreds
of feet in height, and the rocks and trees framed it in
as a picture. Returning, we rode again to the grand
Yosemite Fall, and tying our horses, started to climb to
the foot of the fall, which seemed not very far above us;
but again California air deceived us, and after toiling for
two or three hours up the mountain-side, from bush to
bush and rock to rock, without reaching it, we were
forced to retrace our steps by the approach of evening.

The next morning, we saw a thin smoke curling
above the trees in the lower part of the valley, and after
breakfast had the pleasure of greeting Professor Whitney
and party, of the State Geological Survey. They
had been out for weeks, geologizing along the Sierras[Pg 453]
south of the Yosemite, and had entered the valley the
evening before by the Mariposa trail, to repeat some triangulations
and surveys they were not quite certain of.
They reported the Mariposa route as rather rough, but
practicable, and this was good news, as they were the
pioneers of the season that way. There were five or six
in the party, all active, athletic men, as keen to walk and
climb as to analyze and cipher. They travelled with a
pack-train, and "camped out" invariably, and their Bedouin
habits had made them all as brown as berries. Greetings
over, our horses were soon at the door, and presently,
we all set off together for the Vernal and Nevada Falls.
A mile or so above Hutchings', we struck the main branch
of the Merced, and turning up its bank soon found the ascent
too difficult for horses. Dismounting and turning our
animals loose to graze, we proceeded on foot by a narrow
trail, that wound along beneath umbrageous pines and
firs, just on the margin of the river, which here foamed
and roared at our feet a rushing cascade for a mile or
more. Rounding a shoulder of the cañon, the spray
from the Vernal Fall suddenly wet us to the skin; but
exquisite rainbows, perfect in form and color, began to
flame and circle around us, until it almost seemed as if
you could put their many-colored ends in your pockets.
Rainbows       quadrants and semi-circles       may often be
seen elsewhere; but these were perfect circles, whirling
around and about us, and most intense in color. Moist
as we were, we all stopped to enjoy the scene, and were
reluctant to move onward.

Here, at the Vernal Fall, the whole mass of the Merced
drops 350 feet, without a break, and the volume of
water just then was very great. Stairways and ladders
carry you to the top, and here a natural wall or breast-work
of solid granite enables you to lean out and overlook[Pg 454]
the Fall, and Cascades, and wild cañon beyond, without a
tremor. Above, the river comes shooting like an arrow,
over half a mile of polished granite, from the base of the
upper or Nevada Fall. There the Merced makes another
leap, of seven hundred feet in all; but half-way down, the
rock shelves just sufficiently to keep the water on the flow,
whence it pours in hurrying sheets of lace-like foam to
the bottom. The water here seemed really instinct with
life and motion; the long lines of gauzy foam circled ever
downward and onward; and the whole seemed like one
vast drapery of living lace, which Nature was here ever
weaving to deck the Yosemite. Valenciennes and point-lace
capes and collars, were never so airy and exquisite;
but here they fell, and flowed, and circled, in snowiest
tracery, by the million.

Returning by Mt. Broderick, we rode down to Sentinel
Peak and Cathedral Rock, with Prof. Whitney and
party, having much interesting and delightful talk by
the way, and reached Hutchings' again at nightfall. The
day had been a fatiguing one, so much of the route was
wild and rocky; and I retired early, foot-sore and leg-weary.
Altogether, however, the day was very rich and
enjoyable; and I look back upon it now, as one of the
noblest and best I spent on the Coast. The views of the
Yosemite were everywhere sublime and picturesque; and
at sunset, we beheld "parting day" still playing among
the Sierras, while the Merced and meadows down below
were already in shadowy twilight. In fact, down in the
valley, looking up, you never see but a mere ribbon-like
line of sky at best, flanked on either side by mountains;
and in winter, for half the morning and half the afternoon,
the sun is never visible from Hutchings' at all.
The Yosemite is simply an open tunnel, so to speak,
half a mile or more deep, in the heart of the Sierras,[Pg 455]
and in winter-time the sunlight cannot have much
chance there, except about mid-day. Doubtless the
snow and ice there then must be something gorgeous,
and sublime       glaciers trailing from the walls, and avalanches
now and then thundering from the heights
above, to the far depths below.



[Pg 456]




CHAPTER XXX.

THE YOSEMITE TO SAN FRANCISCO.


The next morning (May 31st), I bade good-bye to
Mr. Hutchings, most hospitable of hosts and gracious
of guides, and started to return via Mariposa. In
addition to Capt. Coulter, I now had Mr. Galen Clark
also, who had piloted Prof. Whitney in from the Mariposa
Grove of Big Trees. Trotting down through the
meadow-like valley, we reached the Professor's camp, and
found them just packing up, for their return via Coulterville.
With a hearty hand-shake all around and mutual
promises to meet again at Stockton, if possible, we
parted, and continued on down the valley, past El Capitan,
sublimest of mountains, the Three Brothers, and
Bridal Veil Fall; and, at length, turning to the left,
struck the Mariposa trail. One would naturally suppose,
that an exit might be found by following the river down;
but the Merced passes out between perpendicular walls
of vast height, miles in extent, so that the only way
into or out of the valley then was by the old Indian
trails to Coulterville or Mariposa.[28]

The Mariposa trail runs by sharp zigzags up the southern
wall, taking advantage of every rock and bush where
an Indian could find a foot-hold, and we found it a long and[Pg 457]
toilsome climb, before we got to the top. We were over
an hour by the watch; but when, at last, we rounded
the last bend, and stood perspiring and breathless on the
jutting ledge of Inspiration Point, what a view opened
before us! From here, you get, perhaps, the best general
view of the Yosemite, as a whole, that can be had; and
as the eye sweeps over its peaks and domes, its battlement
and towers       its massive walls, its flashing streams,
its foaming cataracts       its fragrant groves and sleeping
meadows       the soul swells with unutterable joy; or,
rather, your whole being bows down in reverence and
awe. To the right, the exquisitely beautiful Bridal
Veil Fall descends, wreathed in mists and rainbows.
Beyond, the Three Brothers and Sentinel Peak pierce
the heavens. To the left, in solemn and awful grandeur,
stands El Capitan, severe and self-centred       monarch of
the vale       dominating all. Beyond, the incomparable
Yosemite Fall, as if pouring from the clouds, leaps and
sways and thunders       its mist at times streaming like a
gorgeous pennon, its deep-toned base a perpetual Te
Deum. While farther still, towering above all, clear
cut and distinct against the sapphire sky, the great
South Dome rears its awful front, as if the visage of the
Almighty, and bids the universe bow down and worship.
Clinging to a gnarled and stunted tree, out-grown
from the very granite, we crept far out upon the rocky
ledge, and there seemed literally enfolded by the Infinite.

The overwhelming sublimity, the awful loneliness
and desolation of the scene       its solemn beauty and
grandeur       were simply unutterable. It was a place
to make one feel the littleness of all human achievements,
and to lead a man out of himself up to God.
It was the confrontal of God, face to face, as in[Pg 458]
moments of great danger, or in solemn and sudden
death. It was the perilous edge of battle. It was storm
and shipwreck. It was Niagara, many times magnified.
It was Switzerland, condensed into a coup d'      il. I had
stood on the Rocky Mountains; I had descended the
Columbia; I had crossed the Sierras. But the Yosemite
was all of these, and more, compressed into one
view; and, surely, our planet has not its equal. Most
fittingly has Congress set the Yosemite apart from the
public domain, and consecrated it to mankind, as a
National Park and pleasure-ground forever. Let it
never be degraded to lower uses. So far it was yet
free from debasing associations, and California, as its
natural guardian, must keep it so. Beyond the necessary
paths and bridges, it had so far escaped our so-called
"improvements;" and hereafter, as heretofore, it is to
be hoped, Nature will be allowed to work her own sweet
will there, unchecked by the hand of man.

But our stay there was over, and lifting our hats we
bade the Yosemite a reverent good-bye, and mounting
our horses, turned our faces towards Mariposa. A short
ride along the well-defined trail, over crackling pine
leaves and gigantic cones, brought us to the Hermitage       a
huge sugar-pine, ten or twelve feet in diameter,
hollow in the centre, where a Californian aforetime had
made his home, closing the entrance with a rude door.
It afforded him a goodly-sized room, much better than
many of the border cabins; and here, in the midst of
the gigantic pines, miles away from any human habitation,
as he swung his axe or boiled his pot, he must have
had Solitude to his heart's content.

Passing on, we soon struck the snow, and for five or
six miles again, as when coming into the valley, we again
had a decidedly "hard road to travel." To plunge and[Pg 459]
flounder along so, through snow-field after snow-field,
was tedious and toilsome in the extreme; but there was
no help for us, and we struggled on. A mile or so from
Inspiration Point, in crossing an open glade, where the
snow had melted into a pool, we caught sight of grouse
and deer; but they were off before Clark, an experienced
hunter, could get a shot at them. Some two miles
farther on, we came out into a larger opening, and as
we lifted our eyes from the blinding snow saw, right
across our trail, a hundred yards or so ahead, a huge she-grizzly
and two young cubs. We were all on foot, leading
our horses over the snow the best we could       Capt.
Coulter behind, Clark and I some yards ahead abreast of
each other       our only weapons our trusty revolvers, and
a long single-barrelled rifle of Clark's. My own good
Spencer carbine (seven-shooter), that I had carried so
faithfully across the continent, and through Arizona,
without occasion to use it, I had left in San Francisco,
not thinking it necessary in California. How I wished
for it now, with its seven good balls ready for instant
use!

Simultaneously with our sight of her, Madame
Grizzly also descried us, and Clark at once frankly said
we were in great danger, if she showed fight. For a
minute or two, she stood with her head raised, snuffing
the air, as if calculating the chances, and then deliberately
wheeling in her tracks, shuffled off into the forest       her
cubs gambolling by her side, like clumsy kittens.
Clark instantly threw me his bridle, and decided to try
a shot, if he could sight her heart; but she kept herself
well under cover, as she moved off, and he was afraid to
fire, unless certain of killing her. He said if he missed
or only wounded her, we would have to take to the trees,
as the attack would make her savage and ferocious; and[Pg 460]
also, that if her cubs happened to turn and run toward
us in play, as they often did, we would have to run or
climb for it, as she would take this also for a hostile
movement, and assault us fiercely. Under the circumstances,
clearly discretion was the better part of valor;
nevertheless, Clark wanted the brace of cubs, and when
she waddled off through the slush and snow, he followed
cautiously after, resolved to try his luck, if she gave him
a decent chance. From bush to bush, and tree to tree,
for quite a considerable distance, he dodged along after
her; but presently returned, without firing, declaring the
risk was too great for such a venture, and we were not
sorry to be well rid of her. She was, in truth, as big
as a small cow, and altogether would have been an ugly
customer to deal with, if not killed at the first shot.

Clark said, grizzlies were now rare on this route,
although formerly frequently encountered. And indeed
on both routes, and in all our travel among the Sierra
Nevadas, I was struck with the general absence of animal
life       as I had also been among the Rocky Mountains.
I doubt whether in either of these ranges, there
is anywhere such variety and extent of animal life, as
we always find East, in unfrequented forests and mountains.
The solemn stillness, the glad silence, the perfect
peace and rest of the Sierras, seemed everywhere profound;
and nowhere and never more so, than during this
day's ride in general.

Once well out of the snow, we remounted our gamey
little steeds, and the rest of the day the trail led down
and over the ranges       through magnificent forests of pine
and spruce, cedar and fir       where to ride along was itself a
luxury and delight. The prevailing tree was the California
sugar-pine, so called because the Indians obtain a
rude sugar from boiling down its sap. These sugar-pines[Pg 461]
frequently grow ten and twelve feet in diameter,
and shoot up two hundred and fifty, and three hundred
feet in height. They bear a gigantic cone, four inches
in diameter, by sixteen inches in length usually; and
lest this may seem like a "California story," perhaps I
should add, I myself picked up one, as we rode along,
measuring over eighteen inches in length, and have it now
in my private cabinet. Their dead leaves carpeted the
ground thickly under foot, and often our horses ambled
almost noiselessly along. Overhead, their dense shade
excluded the sun, which hourly became more uncomfortable,
as we descended the range; while the mountain
air was everywhere resinous with their perfume.

Late in the afternoon, we crossed the last ridge, and,
descending into the valley of the South Merced, halted at
"Clark's," the house of our new guide. We had come
twenty-two miles since leaving Hutchings'; and here
found excellent accommodations for the night. Mr. Clark
himself was from the East, I believe Pennsylvania, but
was now an enthusiastic Californian. He said he had
come to California years before, a confirmed consumptive;
but once among the Sierras, inhaling their resinous breath,
his lungs soon healed, and here now he meant to abide
the remainder of his days. He could not live in San Francisco
at all, the air was so raw and sharp there; but here
among the Sierras, he was well and strong, and he looked
indeed as rugged as the mountains themselves. His
house contained several comfortable rooms, and already
the tide of Yosemite travel was setting that way, and
paying him well.

Six miles from Clark's, on the border of Mariposa
and Fresno Counties, is the Mariposa grove of Big Trees.
We visited them next morning (June 1st), under the
guidance of Clark himself, who regards them as his[Pg 462]
special wards. They number in all some five or six hundred,
scattered over perhaps a mile square, but usually in
clumps together. You ride up to them, through an open
forest of huge sugar-pines and cedars, that would be
regarded as sylvan monsters elsewhere       ten and twelve
feet over; but these Big Trees dwarf even such giants,
into pigmies. Many of them, indeed, measure twenty-five
and thirty feet in diameter, and run up three hundred
feet or more in height       the first hundred feet or so
without a limb, and scarcely diminishing in size. Six of
them are over thirty feet in diameter, and from ninety to a
hundred feet in circumference; fifty are over sixteen feet
in diameter; and two hundred over twelve feet. The
"Grizzly Giant," the largest, is thirty-three feet in diameter,
and its first limb       ninety feet from the ground       is
itself six feet through. Another, still standing erect and
vigorous, but hollowed out by fire, three of us rode into
on horseback, one behind the other, and there was still
room for more. Another, prone on the ground, and with
its heart eaten out by fire       reduced to a huge shell       we
rode through on horseback, for a hundred feet or more,
and then passed out       by a small knot-hole!

Among them were some young trees, still coming
forward, mere saplings; but as a rule, these Big Trees
(Sequoia Gigantea, I believe the botanists call them)
impress you with their great age, and hoary venerability.
With many the mountain-fires in other years
have made sad havoc, scarring and half-consuming some
of them; but these are now stopped, the Mariposa Grove
being also included in the Congressional grant, which sets
apart the Yosemite as a National Park and pleasure-ground
forever. Their bark, often eighteen and twenty
inches thick, is of a pure cinnamon-color, and fluted up
and down like a Corinthian column. Their wood is of a[Pg 463]
deep red, and much resembles that of the great red-wood
trees, that are found everywhere in the Coast Range.
Their foliage and cones are much like those of our ordinary
yellow-pines East, though their leaves are somewhat
smaller.


   
   
   A BIG TREE.


The trees here are of the same species as those in the
Calaveras Grove, though I believe a few of the latter
are rather bigger. They are also found elsewhere, along
the western slope of the Sierra Nevadas, in scattered
groves or clumps; but the whole number is not large.
Evidently, they are the lingering survivors of some former
geologic period, and no doubt will soon become extinct.
Many of them are regarded, as already two thousand years
old       some say six thousand; but Professor Whitney assured
me, that he had made a very careful inquiry into
their age, counting their annual rings and otherwise, and
he doubted if any were older than the Christian era. But,
at least, here are trees, that were wooing the air, and rejoicing
in the sun, when the babe was first laid in the
manger at Bethlehem. They have been growing in
beauty and majesty ever since, through all the sunshine
and storms of nineteen centuries. And to-day, they stand
as matchless pillars in God's great temple, to testify of
His skill and power       a fit part of


"That cathedral, boundless as our wonder,
Whose quenchless lamps the sun and moon supply;
Its choir, the wind and waves; its organ, thunder;
Its dome, the sky."


Truly marvels in themselves, in one sense these Big
Trees of California are the greatest natural curiosity in
the world, because no other country possesses any trees
like them. If not really sui generis, their like, at least,
I believe, has not yet been found. California, at her
own request, has been appointed their lawful guardian;[Pg 464]
and the nation and mankind expect, that she will watch
them well. It would seem like sacrilege, indeed, to raise
one's hand against them; and the penitentiary, surely,
would be small punishment, for such a miscreant.

Returning to Clark's, we left there at noon, and the
same evening reached Mariposa, twenty-five miles distant.
The scenery most of the way was superb, vista
after vista opening constantly before us, as we descended
the mountains; but the sun had already acquired a June
fierceness, and the heat seemed doubly oppressive to one
just fresh from the snows of the Sierras. We rode up
to the Mariposa House, dusty and jaded, travel-stained
and weary; but it was now Saturday night, and the most
inveterate cynic will concede, the week had been well
spent.

We found Mariposa to be a straggling village, of a
few hundred inhabitants, with uncertain prospects. It
is the centre of what was once Gen. Fremont's magnificent
estate       seventy miles square, in the heart of Mariposa
County       and formerly was much noted for its
mining operations. But its placer-mines were now
mostly abandoned, except by John Chinaman; and its
famous quartz-mill, that cost over one hundred thousand
dollars       perhaps the finest in California       was standing
idle. The Mariposans, however, had great faith in their
mining resources still, and were expecting their fine mill
to resume operations soon. In the interim, the town
dozed along, in the Micawberish way common to stagnant
mining centres; and welcomed my arrival, as the
advance guard of the Yosemite travel, for that summer.

Here, I bade good-bye to Punty, ever-faithful pony,
and kindly Capt. Coulter, my companions for a week
(good luck to them both!), and took the stage for Stockton
again, via Honitos. This was a ride of a hundred[Pg 465]
miles, through varying landscapes       across the divides and
down the valleys of the Merced, Tuolomne, Stanislaus,
and San Joaquin rivers       and, though hot and dusty, was
yet thoroughly enjoyable. In crossing the ridge at Bear
Valley, you catch a superb view of the Coast Range and
Mt. Diabolo, a hundred miles away; and for the rest of
the ride, Diabolo's lofty crest is almost always in view.
Much of the way was barren and uncultivated, but the
ranches and settlements were yearly pushing farther and
farther into the foot-hills; and as we neared Stockton
again, the illimitable wheat-fields were everywhere about
us.

At Stockton, I had the pleasure of again meeting
Prof. Whitney and party, and further comparing notes
about California and the Coast generally. Thence, taking
the steamer together for San Francisco, we reached
there again June 4th       myself somewhat jaded and dilapidated,
indeed, but richly repaid for all my toil and fatigue
in going to the Yosemite. Kind friends welcomed my
arrival, and the fine fare and downy beds of the Occidental
seemed doubly luxurious. Its proprietor, of course, was
a Leland       one of that family of brothers, who beyond all
other Americans, know excellently well "how to keep a
hotel;" and his thoughtful attentions, his genuine kindness
and courtesy to everybody, were the constant remark
of strangers on the Coast.



[Pg 466]




CHAPTER XXXI.

SAN FRANCISCO TO NEW YORK.


A ride down the bay (June 8th), through San Mateo
and Menlo Park, some fifty miles to San Josè, completed
my wanderings on the Pacific Coast. The air at
San Francisco, fresh from the ocean, was raw and rasping;
but at San Josè, sheltered by the Coast Range, the
thermometer measured over twenty degrees warmer, and
the valley there seemed sleeping in summer. The whole
ride by railroad is through farms and gardens, and San
Josè itself we found embowered in roses and foliage.
Here are old Spanish convents and churches, with their
surroundings of vineyards, fig-trees, orange-groves, etc.,
as at Santa Barbara and Los Angelos       only better preserved       and
the ride thither is a favorite excursion for
San Franciscans and strangers. The sleepy old town is
in vivid contrast, with the rush and whirl of the Golden
Gate; and its soft and delicious air proves a soothing
balm, to the invalid and the weak. A fair hotel furnished
good entertainment, and the place seemed indeed
like a haven of rest, after "roughing it" so in the interior.

Returning to San Francisco, the last farewells were
said, and June 10th, at 11 a. m., the good steamer Constitution
bore us away for Panama. We had spent six
months on the Coast, and would fain have remained
longer, especially to visit the "Geysers." But my official[Pg 467]
work was ended; and besides, I was in receipt of private
letters, that required my presence East. The 10th was
"steamer-day"       still a recognized event in San Francisco.
All business ended then; and from then, began again.
There was a bustle about the hotels, and an air of importance
everywhere. Hundreds thronged the vessel and
wharf, to see their friends off, and tarried till the last moment.
But, prompt to the minute, the Constitution cast
loose, and rounding into the stream, was soon heading
down the bay, for the Golden Gate and the Pacific. Past
Alcatraz and Angel Island, past Fort San Josè and Fort
Point, we reached the bar, and crossed it in a chopping
sea, that soon sent most of the passengers to their berths.

In San Francisco, the sun shone bright as we steamed
away, but the air was raw and chilly like our later
autumn;[29] and once out at sea, we found an overhanging
mist, that often deepened into a winter fog. This uncomfortable
weather continued for a day or two, keeping
most of the passengers below deck       many of them sea-sick;
but as we passed down the coast, the weather
gradually moderated, and soon we were sailing beneath
perfect skies, over, indeed, "summer seas." The rest of
the way down, what a superb voyage it really was! Looking
back on it now, it seems rather a grand picnic excursion,
than a bona fide journey by sea. The ocean, in the
main, proved itself truly Pacific. We were very seldom
out of sight of land by day. The purple, and crimson,
and golden hues of the Coast Range, were a perpetual
wonder and delight. Schools of porpoises, and now and
then a vagrant whale enlivened the day; and the phosphorescent
waves, wide-spreading from our wake, made
our track a blaze of fire by night.
[Pg 468]
And what skies those were! By day, "deeply,
darkly, beautifully blue;" by night, one blaze of
flaming stars. It was the very luxury of travel       the
very poetry of locomotion. Sometimes I would lie for
hours on deck, breathing in the balmy air, watching
the gulls and frigate-birds as they hovered in our
wake, or gazing on far-off hill and mountain, as the
shore opened up before us       losing all sense of thought
and action, content solely with being. Even novel-reading
sometimes seemed a task, and writing a great
burden. And when evening came, we would sit and
talk far into the night; or, leaning over the guards, would
watch the stream as of liquid fire, that boiled, and curled,
and rippled away beneath us.

As we got farther down the coast, the climate became
warmer; but blue-flannels and white-linens in place of
winter-woolens, rendered this endurable, and indeed the
change from temperate to tropic       from latitude 38° to
7°       did not seem so great after all, barring the first day
or two out from San Francisco. Some, however, who
had not provided themselves with such changes of
clothing, complained bitterly of the heat and lassitude,
though most of us got on very well. We had a thunderstorm
one night, and a stiff rain next day, when well
down the Mexican coast; but otherwise were favored
with uninterruptedly fine weather.

From San Francisco to Panama is somewhat over
three thousand miles, and we were fifteen days in making
it. Our steamer was a fine specimen of her class,
with a burden of 3,500 tons, and a carrying capacity of
eleven hundred passengers, besides freight. She measured
three hundred and forty feet in length, by forty-five
feet in beam, and her great deck morning and evening
was a rare promenade. Of passengers, we had only[Pg 469]
about four hundred; so that all had state-rooms, and to
spare. We carried our own beef, and mutton, and
poultry, to be slaughtered as wanted; and our fare, as a
whole, was excellent and generous. Our company, it
must be confessed, was rather heterogeneous, but altogether
was social and enjoyable. We had army officers
and their wives, going east, on leave or transfer; a U.
S. Consul from the Sandwich Islands, en route to Washington,
on public business; Englishmen from Hong
Kong, bound for New York or London; merchants,
bankers, and gamblers from San Francisco; red-shirted
miners from Nevada and Arizona; and women of all
sorts, from fine ladies and true mothers, to dulcineas of
dubious character. The general decorum, however, was
above criticism; and on Sundays, when a San Francisco
divine held service, all were attentive listeners, notwithstanding
his High-Church absurdities. The morning
promenade on deck, and the evening smoke on the
guards, were the great occasions for conversation, and all
enjoyed them to the full.

Our first stopping-place was at Cape St. Lucas, the
extreme point of Southern California, where we put off
two passengers, and took on none. Thence, we crossed
the mouth of the Gulf of California, and halted at Manzanillo,
Mexico       a little hamlet of two or three hundred
souls, the sea-port of the fine town of Colima, some
seventy-five miles inland. Here we put off a hundred
tons of freight, intended for the interior, and spent several
hours. Eight days out, we reached Acapulco, the chief
Mexican port on the Pacific Coast, and world-famous in
other days, when Spain bore rule here. The harbor is
perfectly land-locked, with bold islands off the mouth
and deep water close in shore, and here ought to be a
great and puissant city. From San Francisco down, not[Pg 470]
counting San Diego, this is the first really good harbor;
and here is the great route for trade and travel, across
Mexico, via the capital and Vera Cruz, to the Atlantic.
Yet we found only a squalid town of two or three
thousand inhabitants, mostly half-negro and half-Indian,
with a trace of the Spaniard here and there mixed in.
A handful of Americans and Germans controlled the
business of the town; and as for the rest       they seemed
to be a lotus-eating, inert race, not inaptly denominated
"greasers." A general look of decadence prevailed
everywhere; and if this be a sample of Mexican civilization,
after a trial of two centuries, or more, alas for its
future! Not a single wagon-road led from the town inland,
in any direction; and the only means of transit, to or
from the interior, was by horse or mule-back, over winding
mountain-trails, the same as in the days of Cortez.

We reached there June 18th, soon after breakfast;
and had scarcely rounded to, before the Philistines were       not
exactly upon, but       around us. They swarmed
about our vessel in bum-boats and dug-outs, of all shapes
and sizes, tendering oranges, limes, bananas, shells, etc.,
for a consideration       sending them up the ship's sides by
a cord and tiny basket, trusting us to return the agreed-for
coin. When these failed to please, they paraded
their skill as swimmers and divers, plunging under like
ducks when a coin was tossed overboard, and sure to
catch it before it reached the bottom. With little or no
clothing, except about the loins, and often not that, they
seemed to be an amphibious sort of creatures       equally at
home on land, or sea.

As we were to spend several hours here, taking in
coal and water to last to Panama, many of us embraced
the opportunity to go ashore and see something of the
town. When we touched the beach, comely maidens of[Pg 471]
coffee-colored complexion met us, with baskets and strings
of shells, to any of which we were heartily welcome,
provided we paid well for them. They always tender
their wares as a "gift," a trick of Acapulco's, as also of
Manzanillo's and Panama's; but they invariably expect
more than their real value, in return. Passing on, we
found the town to consist of one-story adobes, with
streets hardly more spacious than good foot-pavements
East, and with little business to speak of, except what the
tri-monthly steamers supplied. The stores were chiefly
baskets or boxes on the side-walks or street-corners, and
even these were in charge of women, while the lazy-looking
men "loafed" or lounged in the shade, sipping
their aguardiente or whiffing their cigarritos with infinite
content. The flocks of children, from infants to half-grown
youths, were usually guiltless of raiment, and all
seemed supremely happy, if only sucking an orange or
munching a banana.

All gazed at Los Americanos with good-natured
curiosity, and a score were eager to show us to the
U. S. Consulate, which was already well-designated by
the Stars and Stripes drooping idly from its staff. The
Consul himself, unfortunately, was absent; but his
deputy, Mr. Sutter, gave us kindly welcome, and we
spent an instructive hour, listening to his stories of
Mexican life and manners. From there, we went to the
rude church or "cathedral," on the plaza; and found in
its tawdry ornaments and doll-like images       its wax-figure
Christs, its tissue-paper angels, and pewter amulets       an
easy explanation of the ignorance, and squalor, and
stagnation of this people. The fat and jolly priest suspended
his devotions, to sell us pewter charms (he
swore, by the Virgin, they were silver!) that would
insure us against fever and shipwreck on the voyage; and[Pg 472]
afterwards he invited us round to take a sip of aguardiente
and see his favorite game-cock. Thence, we strolled
down the beach, between rows of palms and bananas, to
the old Spanish fort, and found it a solid and substantial
structure still, though a century or two old. True, it
would not stand long before one of our modern monitors;
but it was a fine work in its day, and showed well yet.
A company or two of dirty and ragged soldiers constituted
the garrison       their uniforms heterogeneous, and
their arms really worthless. We sent our compliments
to the commanding officer, hoping to gain an entrance;
but he was absent, and his pompous subordinate declined
to admit such Northern barbarians.

Returning to the Constitution, late in the afternoon
we bade good-bye to Acapulco; and thence, following
the trend of the continent, across the gulf of Tehuantepec,
by Guatemala, by San Salvador, by Nicaragua, by
Costa Rica, and finally by New Granada, at last, on the
morning of June 25th, we cast anchor at Panama. During
all of this week's sail, we were hardly ever out of sight of
land, and usually were so near, that we could note the flocks
and herds, the houses and trees, and rich luxuriance of
this tropical coast generally, as we glided by. Lofty
mountain-ranges and cone-shaped peaks       old volcanoes
now extinct, rising thirteen thousand and fourteen thousand
feet above the sea       were generally in view by day;
and at night fitful lightnings, playing apparently from
peak to peak, often lit up the whole heavens.

Here at Panama, the key of two continents and two
oceans, we again struck the busy currents of modern
life, though but little belonged to the natives there. The
broad bay itself, with its shapely islands of perpetual
green, crowned with the ever-graceful palm and banana,
was a delightful scene, tropical thoroughly; but here also[Pg 473]
were lines of busy steamers, from Chili and Australia, as
well as California, and the old harbor gave multiplied signs
of life and energy. The railroad to Aspinwall, costly as it
was, both in life and treasure, opened up a pathway across
the Isthmus to the commerce of the world, and Panama
stands at the gate. In another land, or with a better
people, she would soon become a mighty metropolis.
But we found her much like Acapulco, though with
broader streets, better houses, and more population. I
believe she claimed four or five thousand inhabitants
then; but they were chiefly a mixed race, in which the
most of what is really valuable in humanity seemed to
be dying out. They had no public schools, and scarcely
knew what popular education meant. Their churches,
venerable only for their age, but in this dating back to the
Spanish conquest, were crumbling to ruins. Their religion
was only an ignorant superstition or savage fanaticism.
And their government, so-called, was in a state of chronic
revolution, so that nobody seemed to know when it was up
or down. Of course, the real business of the town was
in the hands of foreigners       chiefly Americans, Germans,
and English       and these "pushed things," with much of
their wonted skill and energy, notwithstanding the
climate. The natives, as a rule, contented themselves
with driving a petty traffic in parrots and shells, oranges
and bananas; and literally swarmed around us, until we
were weary alike of their clamor and dirt.

We reached Panama, as I have said, early in the
morning, but did not get off for Aspinwall until about
noon. All this time was spent in disembarking passengers,
with their baggage, and fast freight; but, at last,
the impatient locomotive whistled "up brakes," and we
moved slowly off. The ride across the Isthmus is fifty
miles, and is usually made in two or three hours; but[Pg 474]
half-way across, a baggage-car broke down, and we were
detained four hours in an impenetrable jungle. It had
rained that morning at Panama, and the sun was still
obscured; but the air was dense with heat and moisture,
that hung as if in strata and folds about you, without a
breath to disturb them       and to say we steamed and sweltered,
during those four long hours there, would only half
express our perspiring experience. All along the road,
there was a tropical luxuriance and splendor, which no
word-painting can describe, and here in this jungle both
seemed to culminate. What we in a sterner clime grow
in hot-houses and conservatories, as rare exotics, there
rioted in the open air, as well they might, and all nature
seemed bursting with exuberance and richness. Underneath,
grasses and shrubbery so dense, that only the
machete could clear the way, or keep them under.
Overhead, the lordly palm and gracious banana, with
flowering vines, pendent, interlacing, creeping, and twining
everywhere. Bread-fruit and bananas hung everywhere,
in clusters as big as half-bushel baskets; and here
and there, birds of brilliant plumage flitted to and fro, fit
denizens with the chattering monkeys, and screaming
parrots, of such a wilderness. The whole ride, indeed,
through the heart thus of the tropics, after all, was a rare
experience; and the transition from the steamer to the
railroad, notwithstanding the heat, a welcome change.

The railroad itself seemed well built, and fairly managed.
It was said, indeed, to rest literally on human
bodies, so many poor fellows perished in the deadly
miasmas, while constructing it. The ties and sleepers
were of lignum-vitæ, and the telegraph poles of terra-cotta
or cement, as nothing else would withstand the insects
and moisture of the Isthmus. The stations were well
apart, and seemed maintained solely for the convenience[Pg 475]
of the road, as hardly a passenger got off or on,
except employés of the company. We could see the
natives, as we passed along, lolling in their hammocks,
or stretched out on mats, in their rude huts of poles and
palm-leaves; and their herds of children ran everywhere
at will, as naked as when born. Sometimes, a few of the
inhabitants clustered about a station; but as a rule, this
required too much effort, and they preferred to take
their dolce far niente in their huts. The taint of the
Spaniard seemed to be over them all; or, else, nature
was too kindly to them, removing all incentive to exertion,
by omitting the necessity for it.

We ran into Aspinwall at 6 p. m., and remained there
until 8 p. m. We spent the time in exploring the town,
but found little to interest any one. It had no storied
past, like Panama; and its future depended on       Pacific
Mail. Some found cheap linens, wines, and cigars, as
Aspinwall was a free port, and laid in a stock for future
consumption, to the damage of our Customs Revenue.
But the most of us were sated and weary, with the day's
rare experiences, and were glad when the steamer's bell
rang "All aboard!" Our High-Church chaplain proved
to be our only really useful man, at Aspinwall, after all.
He married a couple, while we halted there; and would
have married another, had there been time. Both had
been waiting several weeks, much-enduring souls       Aspinwall,
it seems, not affording a minister.

Our complement of passengers had been swelled, by accessions
from Valparaiso and Melbourne; and hence, from
Aspinwall to New York, we were rather overcrowded.
Our good ship Rising Star was staunch and sea-worthy;
but without the roomy accommodations of the Constitution,
or her thorough appointments. Her beef and mutton
were all brought from New York on ice, to last for a[Pg 476]
twenty-day's voyage to Aspinwall and back; and, before
we reached New York, were not like Cæsar's wife       above
suspicion. But, on the whole, there was little to complain
of; and the ship's officers certainly did their utmost,
to make everybody content and comfortable.

Our route to New York, distant about two thousand
miles, lay across the Caribbean Sea, and thence
off the eastern terminus of Cuba, through the West
Indies, home. We had some rough weather, with continuous
thunder and lightning, as it seemed, for a day
or two, while crossing the Caribbean. But, once past
that, we entered a region of blue skies and balmy breezes,
and sighted New York in eight days from Aspinwall.
We passed Cuba so near, that her green hills and mountains
seemed within a stone's throw; and, threading the
West Indies, struck the Gulf Stream, whence both steam
and current hurried us forward. We reached Sandy
Hook at sundown, July 3d, where they quarantined us
till morning, much to our disgust. But the 4th broke
gloriously, over city and bay; and amid ringing bells, and
firing cannon, and fluttering bunting, we steamed proudly
up the harbor       it never seemed so magnificent before       and
touching the pier, thus ended our journey.

To land on such a day seemed a fit conclusion, to such
a twelve-month's ramble, across the continent and over
the seas; and that evening at home, surrounded by loving
friends, seemed doubly dear from the long absence and safe
return. How much we had seen of the Great Republic       only
a little can be told here! How it enlarged, and dignified,
one's conception of the Fatherland! What a magnificent
country we really have       washed by two oceans,
crowned with mountains, and gemmed with lakes; and
yet, evidently, it is only a prophecy of that Greater America,
when we shall occupy the continent, from the Arctic[Pg 477]
down to the Isthmus, with teeming millions, and convert
the Pacific practically into a Yankee sea. Well might
Whittier, our truest seer, melodiously sing:


"I hear the tread of pioneers,
Of nations yet to be;
The first low wash of waves, where soon
Shall roll a human sea."


And, best of all, over all this broad land, there shall then
be but one flag and one freedom, one law and one liberty,
one Right and one Justice, for us and for all men       wherever
born and of whatever faith, however poor or
however humble. And to this end, and for this purpose,
let us, and all who love the English-speaking race, if not
mankind, sincerely pray, God save the Republic!

In conclusion, let me add, to the many friends we met
everywhere en route, for their numberless kindnesses
and unstinted courtesies, we were much indebted; and I
would gratefully record my sense of this here. Nobler
souls, more generous spirits, than most of the people we
encountered, especially in Colorado and California, never
breathed; and here is good fortune to them, one and all,
wherever they may chance to be! Surely, they have
fought a good fight, in their rough life on the border,
preparing the way for civilization, and deserve well of
their country and their kind.

But, all things must end       this volume included; and
so, O reader, in the vernacular of the Coast, "Adios,"
and good-bye!


Trenton, N. J., March, 1874.

APPENDIX.


On page 51, I speak of the Plains as the great stock-raising and
dairy region of America, in the future. As some evidence of how
fast this prophecy is becoming fact, I append the following extracts
from an article by Dr. H. Latham, in the Omaha Herald of June 5,
1870:

"Demonstrated Facts.       The season of 1870 has been a memorable
one in the stock business on the Plains. It commenced in doubt, but
closes with unlimited confidence in the complete practicability and
profits of stock-growing and winter grazing.

"Increase of Cattle in the West.       The number of cattle in the
country west of the Missouri River and east of the Snowy Range, is
now double, if not four times larger than in 1869. Its present magnitude
and future prospects entitle it to a full share of public attention.

"Shipments of Beef to Eastern Markets.       Two years ago our beef
and cattle were brought from the East. To-day, cattle-buyers from
Chicago and New York are stopping at every station on our railroads,
and buying cattle in all our valleys for Eastern consumption. It is
safe to predict that 15,000 head of beeves will be shipped from our
valleys East the present season. During the past week I have
visited some of the great herds on the Plains, and will give your
readers an account of them.

"The Great Herds.       The herds of Edward Creighton, Charles
Hutton, and Thomas Alsop, are grazed on the Big Laramie, which is
a tributary of the North Platte. The Laramie Valley is between
the Black Hills and the Medicine-Bow Range. It is about one
hundred miles long and thirty miles wide. It is about midway in
this valley, and six miles from the railroad station at Laramie, that
these gentlemen have located their stock ranches. They have
extensive houses, stables, and corrals. As we leave the station on a
beautiful August morning (which is characterized by the clearest of
blue skies and golden sunlight), you see Mount Agassiz directly in[Pg 482]
front of you, while Mount Dix and Mount Dodge, with snow-covered
tops, are respectively on the right and left.

"We follow up the Laramie on a smooth road, which is like rolling
the wheels over a floor. We follow the windings of the stream,
which is clear as crystal, and pure as the snow from which its
waters have just come. We first come to a herd of 4,000, half and
three-quarter, breed cows; that is, there are none more than one-half
Texan, and many only one-fourth. They are known among cattle
dealers as short-horned Texas cattle. There are 3,600 calves in this
herd, that are from three-eighths to one-half Durham. These cows
have been here on the Plains one winter and two summers. All the
dry cows are exceedingly fat, and many of the cows, with calves by
their sides, are good beef. In this herd are many two-year-olds and
yearlings, all fat for the butcher, so far as their condition is concerned.
In all this herd there are as many as 9,000 head of cattle       4,000
cows, 3,600 calves, 1,000 two-year-olds, and 500 yearlings.

"Their Habits.       They range over a country fifteen by twenty
miles. The cows and calves run together the year around, and, in
fact, are never separated, but run in families of four, generally, cow,
calf, yearling, and two-year-old. They are to be found on the river
bottoms in the middle of the day, where they had come about 11
o'clock for water. They return about 4 o'clock in the afternoon to
the high grounds, where the rich bunch and the nutritious gramma
grasses are abundant, and feed till night, and lie down on the warm
sandy soil till next morning, when they feed till the heat of the day.
It is interesting to see the habits of these cattle when unrestrained
by herders. They travel back and forth to the water and grazing-ground
in families and little herds, in single file, like their predecessors
of the soil, the buffalo, forming deep paths, or trails, like
them. After having spent three or four hours looking at this herd,
we pass up the river to the beef herd, which consists of 3,500 fat
Texas cattle, in the very highest order at which grass-fed cattle
arrive in this world. These cattle have been here one or two seasons,
and will weigh, upon an average, live weight, 1,300 pounds. They
could all be sold to-day for Eastern markets at good figures. They
have yet three months of good weather to fatten this season, when,
with 5,000 more, bought by these enterprising men, and on their
way here, they will be sold East, or slaughtered and sent East in the
quarter.

"There is, still higher up the stream, and nearer the mountains,
a stock herd of yearlings and two-year-olds, that occupy our time for
an hour or two.

[Pg 483]

"Blooded Stock Cattle.       Then we cross over to Sand Creek, a
small branch of the Laramie, and see the herd of American cattle,
which, including Hutton's and Alsop's, numbers 400, mostly cows.
They are as fine stock as can be found anywhere. Among this herd
are several fine-graded Durham bulls, and two thoroughbreds that
were bought in Ohio at high prices. These parties are owners of
300 blooded bulls, from which the finest calves are being raised by
the cross between them and the graded Texan cow. It is interesting
for the stock man to see these calves, which show the Durham
so clearly in every instance       another proof of the general law that
the stronger and better blooded of the two races will give form and
impress to the progeny. This fact is remarkably illustrated in these
herds       the second and third crosses leaving no trace of the Texan
blood.

"Here, on this ranch, are 300 brood mares, and some young stock,
yearling and two-year-old colts, which have been raised here, and
have never been fed nor sheltered. They are as large and fine colts
as are raised anywhere. These brood mares and colts are herded,
but never stabled nor fed winters.

"Sheep.       We next proceed to these flocks of sheep, which in all
number more than 10,000 head, besides the lambs       of these there
are 3,000       making in all 13,000. Some of these are from New
Mexico, but the great majority are from Iowa, and are fine Merino
sheep. They will average fully five pounds of wool per head.
Ample shelters have been provided them in case of storm. Much
the larger number of these flocks are ewes. The owners expect to
raise 6,000 lambs, and to shear 65,000 pounds of wool next year.

"These parties have about five miles of fence, inclosing hay
grounds, pastures for riding stock, and other purposes. They have,
in all, more than $300,000 invested here, which is a sufficient commentary
upon their enterprise, foresight, and courage. They are the
great stock princes of the mountains. Of all living men they have
done most to solve this question of winter grazing.

"We next proceed to the Little Laramie, where Messrs. Mautle
      Bath have 400 head of American and half-breed stock; they are
at the old stage-road crossing, and have some fine blooded stock.
Above them, behind Sheep Mountain, directly under the white top
of Mount Dodge, named after General Dodge, on the head of the
Little Laramie, is a valley twenty miles long and ten miles wide,
divided about equally by the north, middle, and south forks of that
stream. These are rapid running streams that never freeze in winter.
They have groves of timber on their banks and bottom lands[Pg 484]
furnishing shade in summer and shelter in winter. This valley is a
pocket in the mountains, having only one point of ingress, and no
egress but by the same way. Here are 2,900 cattle owned by Lambard
      Gray, of New York, Captain Coates of the Army, and the
subscriber. Three men are able to herd them, from the nature of
the valley, and it is certainly a cattle paradise. Of this herd, 1,200
are cows, 700 two-year-olds, 300 yearlings, and 700 calves. This
stock is short-horned Texan, and a good lot of stock cattle.

"Iliff's Herds on Crow Greek.       After leaving this herd, we take a
three-hours' run on the railroad, which takes us across the Black
Hills to Cheyenne, which is the headquarters of J. W. Iliff. His
cattle range is down Crow Creek to the Platte, twenty to thirty
miles. On this grazing ground he has 6,700 cattle, classed as follows:
3,500 beeves, 2,000 cows, and 1,200 calves. The stock cattle
are half-breeds, except yearlings and calves, which he has raised,
and which show the Durham cross. The beeves are heavy, fat
cattle, ranging in live weight from 1,200 to 1,400 pounds. This
whole range down Crow Creek, from Cheyenne to the Platte, affords
the best of grasses, and the creek bluffs shelter the stock completely
from storms. Mr. Iliff has been the owner of great herds of cattle
in the last twelve years, and is firm in the faith that this is the
place to raise beef for Eastern markets. His cattle have sold in
Chicago market from five to six cents per pound, live weight, this
season. The whole 3,500 head of beeves will be shipped East this
fall. Mr. Iliff is another of those who have demonstrated to the
world that we have winter grazing, and in so doing he has made a
fortune. Long may such men live to enjoy their fortunes!

"On the other side of the Platte, on the Bijou, are the herds of
the Patterson Brothers, Reynolds, and John Hitson. These herds
number 8,000 head of cattle, 6,000 of them being beef-cattle. The
Patterson Brothers are great cattle-raisers and dealers. They own
ranches on the Arkansas River, at Bent's Old Fort, and on the Pecos
River, below Fort Sumner, in New Mexico. They have handled
hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of cattle in the last five
years.

"John Hitson is another of the great cattle-raisers and dealers in
New Mexico. His herds are numbered by the thousands. His
operations are transferred to Colorado now, and so are those of the
Patterson Brothers. On Box-Elder Creek, which is a branch of the
Caché la Poudre, is the ranch and stock range of Mr. Whitcombe,
an old settler of Colorado. He has 2,000 stock cattle and some fine
blooded bulls. This range and shelter are perfect.

[Pg 485]

"Reed       Wyatt, on the Platte, nearer Denver, have 1,000 head
of stock and beef cattle. They are about adding largely to their
number.

"Farwell Brothers, Greeley, have 200 head of fine American
cattle.

"Baily, on the south side of the Platte from Greeley, has 400
head of Durham and Devon stock, and 2,000 sheep.

"Geary, on the Platte, has 300 head of American cattle.

"The Lemons, at Greeley, have 400 head of American stock. In
this neighborhood, Ashcraft has 400 head of American cattle; Munson
has 800 head of cattle and 3,000 sheep. Up the Caché la Poudre
are twenty large stock-raisers.

"On the Big and Little Thompson's there are some five herds of
blooded stock.

"After you leave Evans and go south towards Denver, the whole
country seems one pasture covered with stock. I travelled over
this same ground in 1869, and I am sure there are fully three times
as many cattle here now as then. There are hundreds of farmers
on the Lone-Tree Creek, Caché la Poudre, Big and Little Thompson's
Creeks, St. Vrain's, and many other streams which flow from
the mountains to the Platte, who have from one hundred to one
thousand head of cattle, a description of whose herds and grazing
grounds would take too much space in an article of this kind.

"Shipments of Cattle West.       Colorado has sold an immense number
of cattle this season to Montana, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah. It is
safe to say that Montana will receive twenty thousand head of
cattle during the season of 1870, four-fifths of which are from Colorado.
Many have gone to Utah, Nevada, and Idaho from the same
source, and yet, ten years ago, the commercial and stock-growing
people of the East did not know that Colorado contained a thousand
acres of grass land. To-day they have no idea of the magnitude of
her grazing resources.

"Leaving Colorado, we find some herds along the base of the
Black Hills.

"North of Cheyenne.       H. Kelly, on the 'Chug,' has 500 stock
cattle. He sold 100 head of American beeves at $70 per head.

"Messrs. Ward       Bullock, at Fort Laramie, have 200 head of
American cattle.

"Adolph Cluny, so long a resident on the North Platte, has a
herd of 1,000 stock cattle between Forts Laramie and Fetterman.

"Between Cheyenne and Sidney, on the line of the railroad,
there are several small herds. At Sidney are the Moore Brothers,[Pg 486]
who have 12,000 sheep and lambs, and 1,400 cattle; 400 of the latter
are American and very fine. The sheep sheared an average of five
pounds of wool per head last spring. They are graded Merinos, and
are in fine condition. There is no disease among them. The Moore
Brothers were ranchmen on the South Platte, prior to the day of
railroads, and are about returning to that stream for grazing. Their
place is the Valley Station of olden fame on the stage road. Above
them, on the Platte, at the old 'Junction,' Mr. Mark Boughton has
2,500 stock cattle. He has as fine a cattle range as there is in the
world, not excluding the Pampas of South America nor table-lands
of Australia.

"Farther down the Platte, at O'Fallon's Bluffs, on the north side
of the South Platte, Creighton       Parks have 3,500 stock cattle,
400 of which are Durhams. They range twenty miles up and down
the Platte. Near them, below, is the herd of Mr. Keith, of North
Platte Station, who has about 1,000 head.

"Mr. M. H. Brown has 500 head of stock cattle and beeves near
the same place.

"Across the Platte, in the neighborhood of Fort McPherson, the
Bent Brothers have 1,000 head of stock cattle, and will add another
1,000 the present season.

"Messrs. Carter       Coe have a large herd near there, which
numbers near a thousand.

"Mr. Benjamin Gallagher has 1,200 head at the old Gilman
ranch, twelve miles from McPherson.

"Progress this Season.       More real progress has been made in
stock matters west of the Missouri this season than in all time
before. We have not only added to the numbers of our herds and
flocks, but we have given confidence to all our stock-growers and to
Eastern people in the permanency and profit of grazing in the Trans-Missouri
country.

"We are now in easy reach of Eastern markets. The railways
are landing the heaviest cattle in Chicago from the Rocky Mountains
at $9 and $10 per head; we can sell thousands and tens of
thousands annually to the Pacific slope, and there is still an all-absorbing
home demand to stock our thousands of valleys.

"The Future.       As every country in the West receives a new
emigrant, and his plow turns the grass under, that corn and wheat
may grow in its stead, the range of the stock-grower is that much
contracted, and the area of grazing lessened. By reason of the high
value of lands for grain-growing purposes the people of the country
east of the Mississippi River are already coming to us for beef and[Pg 487]
mutton. Chicago and New York people are enjoying the juicy
steaks from cattle fattened on our nutritious grasses that grow in
our valleys and on our mountain-sides, close up to the perpetual
snows of the Rocky Mountains.

"As immigration takes up more and more of the pastures east
of us for grain, drovers will be obliged more and more to come to us
for beef. Texas, the great hive of cattle, has received three hundred
thousand settlers this season. The grazing area of that State
has been lessened at least a million acres thereby. Everywhere
events point to this Trans-Missouri country as the future dependence
of the East for wool, beef, mutton, and horses."



Page 60.       The following article, clipped from the New-York
Times, contains so much valuable information, bearing on the question
of Irrigation, as related to the Plains and the great Internal Basin
of the Continent, that I venture to insert it here. It seems to be a
careful resumé of the facts that were brought before the notable
Convention of Governors and others, that met in Denver in the
autumn of '73, to consider the question of a general and comprehensive
system of irrigation for all that region:

WATER SUPPLY FOR THE GREAT PLAINS REQUIRED.

Correspondence of the New-York Times.


Denver, Colorado, Friday, Oct. 17, 1873.


It is a fact, perhaps not generally considered, that the ninety-ninth
meridian of longitude west from Greenwich, the meridian of
Fort Kearney on the Platte, and Fort Hays, marks a division line in
the physical geography of the continent. Here the prairies merge
into the great plains, and the abundant rain-fall of eastern meridians
ceases. West of this line lies one-half of the area of the United
States, all of which, excepting a small strip on the shores of the
Pacific, is without sufficient rain-fall for the cultivation of the soil.
This great arid region comprises more than two-thirds of Kansas
and Nebraska, a large portion of California, Oregon, Washington,
and Texas, and nearly all of Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico,
Idaho, Montana, Arizona, Nevada, and Dakota. Here are one million
square miles of barren country, and the question is, What shall we
do with it?

[Pg 488]

The keen interest felt in this matter has been evident from the
large attendance upon this convention, and the mass of information
and argument presented. Whatever has been done thus far toward
reclaiming any portion of these waste lands has been by individual
enterprise, except in Utah and New Mexico a system of irrigation
has been enforced by legislative enactments. In New Mexico the
acequias are the most important features of the country. The subsistence
of the people depends upon them, and the laws protecting
them fill many pages of the statute books. An overseer of acequias
is selected in every precinct, who fixes the number of laborers to be
furnished by each land-owner, apportions their work, and distributes
the water. Yet not over 300 square miles is under cultivation in
that Territory. In Utah, where there is in operation the most complete
and successful system of irrigation in this country, only about
140,000 acres are under cultivation. By legislative enactment the
counties have power to build canals just as they build roads. Water
commissioners are chosen at regular elections, in each county, and
their services are paid out of the general tax levy, and they give
bonds for the faithful performance of their duties. Subordinate
commissioners, or water masters, are selected by neighborhoods,
cities, and towns, and they are paid by assessments on the land.
There are now over 1,200 miles of irrigating canals in Utah, with a
capacity for watering 100,000 acres. The population of the Territory
is upward of 150,000. It has 190 prosperous towns and cities.
Its farm products are shipped into the neighboring Territories, and
even into the Missouri Valley. In Colorado there has been no general
plan of irrigation. Private corporations build canals and sell
the water therefrom to the ranchmen. Several of the towns are
supplied in this way. The colonies have also done much in this
respect. But no general system has been adopted in that Territory,
nor has the legislature ever taken cognizance of the situation. The
same may be said of the other States and Territories interested in
this movement. Irrigation has been limited. The few acres that
have been reclaimed in the immediate vicinity of the streams and
cañons, near the mountains, bear no comparison to the vast body
of plain and desert stretching hundreds of miles in every direction.

The cost of constructing irrigating canals varies according to
the character of the country. The average in Colorado has been $7
per acre. It is thought by competent engineers that in a general
system of canals for the Plains, east of Denver, the cost must run
from $10 to $15 per acre. According to careful estimates, Colorado[Pg 489]
has a water supply sufficient to irrigate 6,000,000 acres, an arable
area which, in Egypt, in the times of the Ptolemies, supplied food
for 8,000,000 people. The Plains, extending from the foot-hills of
the Rocky Mountains eastward nearly 300 miles, comprise about
25,000,000 acres. Of this vast tract there are 1,500,000 acres belonging
to the Kansas Pacific Railway Company, lying south of the
Platte River, and which a canal from the Platte Cañon to the headwaters
of the Republican will cover. Such a canal, 12 feet wide
and 3 feet deep, will cost $1,000 per mile. It will make lands
that now go a-begging at $2.50 per acre worth from $10 to $15.

The want of water is the one and only drawback to the settlement
of the Trans-Missouri country. Farming along the streams
has been carried on enough to show that the soil is not only fertile,
but extremely so, insuring, with plenty of water, crops surpassing
those of the best farming districts elsewhere. The average yield,
year in and year out, through the Rocky Mountain region, whenever
irrigation is employed, has been found to be as follows: Wheat,
27 bushels per acre; oats, 55; potatoes, 150 to 200; onions, 250;
barley, 33. This is far above the average of Illinois or Ohio. It is
believed that the mountain streams, if turned into proper channels,
will irrigate the greater part of the Plains, both east and west of the
Mountains. This is particularly true of Western Kansas and
Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and New Mexico. The great
rivers of the Platte, Arkansas, Rio Grande, and Colorado could be
divided at or near their source in the mountains, and made to cover
vast quantities of land. In Utah, it is proposed to take out canals
from the Jordan, Weber, and Bear rivers, diminishing the supply
in Great Salt Lake, and distributing it over other adjacent portions
of the territory. And in California, engineers have been sent out to
turn the Colorado River into the desert of Arizona, and Southern
California.



Page 279.       Her statistics (San Francisco) for 1873 are equally significant,
and foot up about as follows: In that year over 70,000 people
arrived there, by land and sea, and less than half that number
departed. Nearly 4,000 vessels entered her harbor, measuring about
2,000,000 tons. She exported 10,000,000 sacks of wheat, and nearly
1,000,000 barrels of flour; and Californians claimed, it wasn't much
of a year for "wheat", either! The total wheat crop of the State,
which mostly sought her wharves, was estimated as worth fully[Pg 490]
$26,000,000, or nearly $10,000,000 more than in 1872       prices being
higher; the wool-clip, say, $7,000,000; the wine product, $2,000,000.
Her total exports, of all kinds, was estimated at about $80,000,000;
and, best of all, while her exports had largely increased, her imports
had considerably decreased. Real estate had been dull for a year or
two, and yet her sales that year aggregated about $15,000,000;
while her mining stocks sold for $150,000,000, and paid dividends
about $14,000,000, as against less than half that amount in 1872.
The cash value of her property was estimated at $250,000,000 and
of the State at about $600,000,000.

California's yield of the precious metals in 1873 was estimated at
about $18,000,000, which was some two millions less than in 1872,
and was already surpassed by her magnificent wheat crop of
$26,000,000. Her total agricultural products for '73 were believed
to aggregate $80,000,000; while all her mines and manufactures
produced only about $70,000,000, though employing nearly double
the number of people. Evidently, with her vast area of 120,000,000
acres of land, of which fully 40,000,000 are fit for the plow, our
farmers there have a brilliant future before them, notwithstanding
they will have to irrigate to raise some crops.

fine, and the following table of the total for that year, from
the districts west of the Missouri River, gave immense satisfaction

            Grand total
            $72,258,693
        
    



[Pg 492]

The total yield for 1872 was only $62,236,913; so that here is a gain
of $10,000,000 or so in one year. This extra increase, however, was
chiefly from Nevada, whose total product, it will be seen, about
equals that of all the others; and it must be credited mainly to the
great Comstock Lode, whose ores, it is now about demonstrated,
grow richer and better, the deeper you go down, like the best mines
of Mexico and Peru. In 1871 they averaged only $27 per ton; in
1872 they increased to $32; and in 1873 to $40. These figures well
sustain Mr. Sutro's theories, and his great tunnel may yet become a
fixed fact, ere long.

FOOTNOTES:



[1] Mostly published by Congress in 1867-8, and among the Pub.
Docs. for those years.


[2] The line thence to California was run by Wells, Fargo       Co.


[3] See Appendix.


[4] See Appendix.


[5] This road since built and now in operation.


[6] I believe these are now called Colorado Springs, and much
resorted to, and Manitou is somewhere about the Garden of the Gods.


[7] The Denver and Santa Fe narrow-gauge railroad, now in operation,
following the mountains down, has doubtless done much to
revive and stimulate this whole region again. But it halts, I believe
at Pueblo for the present.


[8] As Governor he was ex-officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs
there.


[9] Good! good!


[10] Senator Wade's Bill (1867) met the Utah Question somewhat
like this, and I suspect Judge                had a finger in it. So, Senator
Cragin's Bill subsequently, and others since. The present imbroglio
in Utah hinges on this Jury Question, more than anything else,
and Congress ought to settle it speedily, on a just and right basis.
Judge McKean may be in the wrong technically; but substantially,
he is fighting for truth and justice, and if he lacks the necessary
weapons, should be furnished them. This is what Senator Frelinghuysen's
Bill, now pending, (1874) proposes well to do.


[11] He was originally from Pennsylvania.


[12] His account in the Bank of England was said to be fourth on the
list, in point of magnitude, and his wealth estimated any where from
$25,000,000 to $50,000,000.


[13] But she has already filled this gap with a branch Road, which
ultimately she will push north to the Columbia, and south to the
Gulf of California.


[14] Though since scourged severely by fire, (1873), she has vindicated
herself well by prompt and general rebuilding, like Chicago.


[15] See Appendix.


[16] In 1873, she yielded 36,000,000 pounds, which she sold for about
twenty cents per pound, or say $7,000,000.


[17] See p. 225.


[18] See Appendix


[19] In those days, it appears, the Jesuits had over a score of Missions
in California, and some thirty thousand half civilized-Indians living
in their communities. Their horned cattle numbered four hundred
and twenty-four thousand; their horses, mules, and asses, besides
the wild ones that scoured the plains in troops, sixty-two thousand
five hundred; their sheep, goats, and swine, three hundred and
twenty-one thousand; and the wheat, barley, maize, and other grains
they raised measured one hundred and twenty-two thousand five
hundred bushels annually. The richest in cattle and horses, and the
greatest grain-producer, was San Gabriel, now a modest hamlet.
Next to it in everything else, and ahead of it in sheep, was San
Luis Rey, now even modester, which also had the most Indians. The
Mission Dolores, now San Francisco, stood low on the list, with its
five hundred Indians shivering in the wind and fog, five thousand
horned cattle, sixteen hundred horses and mules, four thousand
sheep and swine, and other things in proportion.


[20] Since the above was written, I believe, the Panama steamers
have resumed their calls at San Diego, and doubtless the town is
again looking up. So, also, the Arizona trade and travel now start
mainly from here, and a railroad to the Colorado at least seems inevitable.


[21] See foot-note page 329.


[22] Huge tide-waves at the head of the Gulf.


[23] Hence the recent proposition to turn the Colorado thither and
convert all this district, including the Yuma or Colorado Desert, into
a great lake or inland sea. It seems hardly feasible in this generation;
but, possibly, may happen in the future.


[24] They were our escort from Prescott, whom we had dismissed
at Mojave, with orders to return as soon as rested. But, it seems,
the poor fellows were tired of Arizona, and as they were so far on
their way "inside," concluded to continue thither!


[25] Above Dutch Flat, the maximum grade of 116 feet per mile
has been resorted to, for over ten miles. From Owl Gap to the
Summit, a distance of twenty-four and a half miles, the average
grade is 81, and the maximum 85 feet per mile. From the Summit
to the Truckee, the average is 84, and the maximum 90 feet per
mile; but down the Truckee, the grades average less than 40 feet
per mile.


[26] See Appendix.


[27] Perhaps I should add, my friend Dr. M. had already returned
East, via Hong Kong and Calcutta, around the world; and L. was in
San Francisco, suffering from the ague.


[28] Now, I believe, a carriage-road has been blasted out, following
the Merced. But what it adds in comfort, it must lose in scenery.


[29] The evening before, I saw ladies at the opera, with their winter
furs on.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
