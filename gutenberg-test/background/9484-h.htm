glory of the world, to see beauty in all its forms and manifestations,
to feel ugliness like a pain, to resent the wrongs of others as bitterly
as one's own, to know mankind as others know single men, to know Nature

<h2><a name="introduction">Prefatory Note</a></h2>
<br>
This volume is issued in the belief that English poetry is now once
again putting on a new strength and beauty.<br>
<br>
Few readers have the leisure or the zeal to investigate each volume as
it appears; and the process of recognition is often slow. This
collection, drawn entirely from the publications of the past two years,
may if it is fortunate help the lovers of poetry to realize that we are
at the beginning of another "Georgian period" which may take rank in due
time with the several great poetic ages of the past.<br>
<br>
It has no pretension to cover the field. Every reader will notice the
absence of poets whose work would be a necessary ornament of any
anthology not limited by a definite aim. Two years ago some of the
writers represented had published nothing; and only a very few of the
others were known except to the eagerest "watchers of the skies." Those
few are here because within the chosen period their work seemed to have
gained some accession of power.<br>
<br>
My grateful thanks are due to the writers who have lent me their poems,
and to the publishers (Messrs Elkin Mathews, Sidgwick and Jackson,
Methuen, Fifield, Constable, Nutt, Dent, Duckworth, Longmans, and
Maunsel, and the Editors of <i>Basileon, Rhythm</i>, and the <i>English
Review</i>) under whose imprint they have appeared.<br>

<h3><i>The Sale of Saint Thomas</i></h3>

<br>
<br>
<i>A quay with vessels moored</i><br>
<br>
<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>To India! Yea, here I may take ship;<br>
From here the courses go over the seas,<br>
Along which the intent prows wonderfully<br>
Nose like lean hounds, and track their journeys out,<br>
Making for harbours as some sleuth was laid<br>
For them to follow on their shifting road.<br>
Again I front my appointed ministry. &mdash; <br>
But why the Indian lot to me? Why mine<br>
Such fearful gospelling? For the Lord knew<br>
What a frail soul He gave me, and a heart<br>
Lame and unlikely for the large events. &mdash; <br>
And this is worse than Baghdad! though that was<br>
A fearful brink of travel. But if the lots,<br>
That gave to me the Indian duty, were<br>
Shuffled by the unseen skill of Heaven, surely<br>
That fear of mine in Baghdad was the same<br>
Marvellous Hand working again, to guard<br>
The landward gate of India from me. There<br>
I stood, waiting in the weak early dawn<br>
To start my journey; the great caravan's<br>
Strange cattle with their snoring breaths made steam<br>
Upon the air, and (as I thought) sadly<br>
The beasts at market-booths and awnings gay<br>
Of shops, the city's comfortable trade,<br>
Lookt, and then into months of plodding lookt.<br>
And swiftly on my brain there came a wind<br>
Of vision; and I saw the road mapt out<br>
Along the desert with a chalk of bones;<br>
I saw a famine and the Afghan greed<br>
Waiting for us, spears at our throats, all we<br>
Made women by our hunger; and I saw<br>
Gigantic thirst grieving our mouths with dust,<br>
Scattering up against our breathing salt<br>
Of blown dried dung, till the taste eat like fires<br>
Of a wild vinegar into our sheathèd marrows;<br>
And a sudden decay thicken'd all our bloods<br>
As rotten leaves in fall will baulk a stream;<br>
Then my kill'd life the muncht food of jackals. &mdash; <br>
The wind of vision died in my brain; and lo,<br>
The jangling of the caravan's long gait<br>
Was small as the luting of a breeze in grass<br>
Upon my ears. Into the waiting thirst <br>
Camels and merchants all were gone, while I<br>
Had been in my amazement. Was this not<br>
A sign? God with a vision tript me, lest<br>
Those tall fiends that ken for my approach<br>
In middle Asia, Thirst and his grisly band<br>
Of plagues, should with their brigand fingers stop<br>
His message in my mouth. Therefore I said,<br>
If India is the place where I must preach,<br>
I am to go by ship, not overland.<br>
And here my ship is berthed. But worse, far worse<br>
Than Baghdad, is this roadstead, the brown sails,<br>
All the enginery of going on sea,<br>
The tackle and the rigging, tholes and sweeps,<br>
The prows built to put by the waves, the masts<br>
Stayed for a hurricane; and lo, that line<br>
Of gilded water there! the sun has drawn<br>
In a long narrow band of shining oil<br>
His light over the sea; how evilly move<br>
Ripples along that golden skin! &mdash; the gleam<br>
Works like a muscular thing! like the half-gorged<br>
Sleepy swallowing of a serpent's neck.<br>
The sea lives, surely! My eyes swear to it;<br>
And, like a murderous smile that glimpses through<br>
A villain's courtesy, that twitching dazzle<br>
Parts the kind mood of weather to bewray<br>
The feasted waters of the sea, stretched out<br>
In lazy gluttony, expecting prey.<br>
How fearful is this trade of sailing! Worse<br>
Than all land-evils is the water-way<br>
Before me now. &mdash; What, cowardice? Nay, why<br>
Trouble myself with ugly words? 'Tis prudence,<br>
And prudence is an admirable thing.<br>
Yet here's much cost &mdash; these packages piled up,<br>
Ivory doubtless, emeralds, gums, and silks,<br>
All these they trust on shipboard? Ah, but I,<br>
I who have seen God, I to put myself<br>
Amid the heathen outrage of the sea<br>
In a deal-wood box! It were plain folly.<br>
There is naught more precious in the world than I:<br>
I carry God in me, to give to men.<br>
And when has the sea been friendly unto man?<br>
Let it but guess my errand, it will call<br>
The dangers of the air to wreak upon me,<br>
Winds to juggle the puny boat and pinch<br>
The water into unbelievable creases.<br>
And shall my soul, and God in my soul, drown?<br>
Or venture drowning? &mdash; But no, no; I am safe.<br>
Smooth as believing souls over their deaths<br>
And over agonies shall slide henceforth<br>
To God, so shall my way be blest amid<br>
The quiet crouching terrors of the sea,<br>
Like panthers when a fire weakens their hearts;<br>
Ay, this huge sin of nature, the salt sea,<br>
Shall be afraid of me, and of the mind<br>
Within me, that with gesture, speech and eyes<br>
Of the Messiah flames. What element<br>
Dare snarl against my going, what incubus dare<br>
Remember to be fiendish, when I light<br>
My whole being with memory of Him?<br>
The malice of the sea will slink from me,<br>
And the air be harmless as a muzzled wolf;<br>
For I am a torch, and the flame of me is God.</blockquote><br>

<i>A Ship's Captain:</i>

<blockquote>You are my man, my passenger?</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>I am.<br>
I go to India with you.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>Well, I hope so.<br>
There's threatening in the weather. Have you a mind<br>
To hug your belly to the slanted deck,<br>
Like a louse on a whip-top, when the boat<br>
Spins on an axle in the hissing gales?</blockquote><br>


<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>Fear not. 'Tis likely indeed that storms are now<br>
Plotting against our voyage; ay, no doubt<br>
The very bottom of the sea prepares<br>
To stand up mountainous or reach a limb<br>
Out of his night of water and huge shingles,<br>
That he and the waves may break our keel. Fear not;<br>
Like those who manage horses, I've a word<br>
Will fasten up within their evil natures<br>
The meanings of the winds and waves and reefs.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>You have a talisman? I have one too;<br>
I know not if the storms think much of it.<br>
I may be shark's meat yet. And would your spell<br>
Be daunting to a cuttle, think you now?<br>
We had a bout with one on our way here;<br>
It had green lidless eyes like lanterns, arms<br>
As many as the branches of a tree,<br>
But limber, and each one of them wise as a snake.<br>
It laid hold of our bulwarks, and with three<br>
Long knowing arms, slimy, and of a flesh<br>
So tough they'ld fool a hatchet, searcht the ship,<br>
And stole out of the midst of us all a man;<br>
Yes, and he the proudest man upon the seas<br>
For the rare powerful talisman he'd got.<br>
And would yours have done better?</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>                           I am one<br>
Not easily frightened. I'm for India.<br>
You will not put me from my way with talk.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>My heart, I never thought of frightening you. &mdash; <br>
Well, here's both tide and wind, and we may not start.</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>Not start? I pray you, do.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>It's no use praying;<br>
I dare not. I've not half my cargo yet.</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>What do you wait for, then?</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>A carpenter.</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>You are talking strangely.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

 <blockquote> But not idly.<br>
I might as well broach all my blood at once<br>
Here as I stand, as sail to India back<br>
Without a carpenter on board; &mdash; O strangely<br>
Wise are our kings in the killing of men!</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>But does your king then need a carpenter?</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>Yes, for he dreamed a dream; and like a man<br>
Who, having eaten poison, and with all<br>
Force of his life turned out the crazing drug,<br>
Has only a weak and wrestled nature left<br>
That gives in foolishly to some bad desire<br>
A healthy man would laugh at; so our king<br>
Is left desiring by his venomous dream.<br>
But, being a king, the whole land aches with him.</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>What dream was that?</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>A palace made of souls; &mdash; <br>
Ay, there's a folly for a man to dream!<br>
He saw a palace covering all the land,<br>
Big as the day itself, made of a stone<br>
That answered with a better gleam than glass<br>
To the sun's greeting, fashioned like the sound<br>
Of laughter copied into shining shape:<br>
So the king said. And with him in the dream<br>
There was a voice that fleered upon the king:<br>
'This is the man who makes much of himself<br>
For filling the common eyes with palaces<br>
Gorgeously bragging out his royalty:<br>
Whereas he hath not one that seemeth not<br>
In work, in height, in posture on the ground,<br>
A hut, a peasant's dingy shed, to mine.<br>
And all his excellent woods, metals, and stones,   <br>
The things he's filched out of the earth's old pockets <br>
And hoised up into walls and domes; the gold,   <br>
Ebony, agate stairs, wainscots of jade,<br>
The windows of jargoon, and heavenly lofts<br>
Of marble, all the stuff he takes to be wealth,<br>
Reckons like savage mud and wattle against<br>
The matter of my building.' &mdash; And the king,<br>
Gloating upon the white sheen of that palace,<br>
And weeping like a girl ashamed, inquired<br>
'What is that stone?' And the voice answered him,<br>
'Soul.' 'But in my palaces too,' said he,<br>
'There should be soul built: I have driven nations,<br>
What with quarrying, what with craning, down<br>
To death, and sure their souls stay in my work.'<br>
And 'Mud and wattle' sneered the voice again;<br>
But added, 'In the west there is a man,<br>
A slave, a carpenter, whose heart has been<br>
Apprenticed to the skill that built my reign,<br>
This beauty; and were he master of your gangs,<br>
He'ld build you a palace that would look like mine.' &mdash; <br>
So now no ship may sail from India,<br>
Since the king's scornful dream, unless it bring<br>
A carpenter among its homeward lading:<br>
And carpenters are getting hard to find.</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>And have none made for the king his desire?</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>Many have tried, with roasting living men<br>
In queer huge kilns, and other sleights, to found<br>
A glass of human souls; and others seek<br>
With marvellous stone to please our desperate king.<br>
Always at last their own tormented bodies<br>
Delight the cruelty of the king's heart.</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>Well then, I hope you'll find your carpenter,<br>
And soon. I would not that we wait too long;<br>
I loathe a dallying journey. &mdash; I should suppose<br>
We'ld have good sailing at this season, now?</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>Why, you were looking, a few minutes gone,<br>
For rare wild storms: I hope we'll have them too;<br>
I want to see you work that talisman<br>
You boast about: I've a great love for spells.</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>Let it be storm or calm, so we be sailing.<br>
I long have wished to voyage into mid sea,<br>
To give my senses rest from wondering<br>
On this perplexèd grammar of the land<br>
Written in men and women, the strange trees,<br>
Herbs, and those things so like to souls, the beasts.<br>
My wilful senses will keep perilously<br>
Employed with these my brain, and weary it<br>
Still to be asking. But on the high seas<br>
Such throng'd reality is left behind, &mdash; <br>
Only vast air and water, and the hue<br>
That always seems like special news of God.<br>
Surely 'tis half way to eternity<br>
To go where only size and colour live;<br>
And I could purify my mind from all<br>
Worldly amazement by imagining<br>
Beyond my senses into God's great Heaven,<br>
If I were in mid sea. I have dreamed of this.<br>
Wondrous too, I think, to sail at night,<br>
While shoals of moonlight flickers dance beside,   <br>
Like swimming glee of fishes scaled in gold,    <br>
Curvetting in thwart bounds over the swell;   <br>
The perceiving flesh, in bliss of such a beauty,<br>
Must sure feel fine as spiritual sight. &mdash; <br>
Moods have been on me, too, when I would be<br>
Sailing recklessly through wild darkness, where<br>
Gigantic whispers of a harassed sea<br>
Fill the whole world of air, and I stand up<br>
To breast the danger of the loosen'd sky,<br>
And feel my immortality like music, &mdash; <br>
Yea, I alone in the broken world, firm things<br>
All gone to monstrous flurry, knowing myself<br>
An indestructible word spoken by God. &mdash; <br>
This is a small, small boat?</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

 <blockquote>                      Small is nothing,<br>
A bucket will do, so it know how to ride<br>
Top upward: cleverness is the thing in boats.<br>
And I wish this were cleverer: she goes crank<br>
At times just when she should go sober.<br>
But what? Boats are but girls for whimsies: men<br>
Must let them have their freaks.</blockquote><br>


<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>                   Have you good skill<br>
In seamanship?</blockquote><br>


<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>       Well, I am not drowned yet,<br>
Though I'm a grey man and have been at sea<br>
Longer than you've been walking. My old sight<br>
Can tell Mizar from Alcor still.</blockquote><br>


<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>                   Ay, so;<br>
Doubtless you'll bring me safe to India.<br>
But being there &mdash; tell me now of the land:<br>
How use they strangers there?</blockquote><br>


<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>                Queerly, sometimes.<br>
If the king's moody, and tired of feeling nerves<br>
Mildly made happy with soft jewel of silk,<br>
Odours and wines and slim lascivious girls,<br>
And yearns for sharper thrills to pierce his brain,<br>
He often finds a stranger handy then.</blockquote><br>



<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>Why, what do you mean?</blockquote><br>


<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>       There was a merchant came<br>
To Travancore, and could not speak our talk;<br>
And, it chanced, he was brought before the throne<br>
Just when the king was weary of sweet pleasures.<br>
So, to better his tongue, a rope was bent<br>
Beneath his oxters, up he was hauled, and fire<br>
Let singe the soles of his feet, until his legs<br>
Wriggled like frying eels; then the king's dogs<br>
Were set to hunt the hirpling man. The king<br>
Laught greatly and cried, 'But give the dogs words they know,<br>
And they'll be tame.' &mdash; Have you the Indian speech?<br>
</blockquote><br>

<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>Not yet: it will be given me, I trust.</blockquote><br>


<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>You'd best make sure of the gift. Another stranger,<br>
Who swore he knew of better gods than ours,<br>
Seemed to the king troubled with fleas, and slaves<br>
Were told to groom him smartly, which they did<br>
Thoroughly with steel combs, until at last<br>
They curried the living flesh from off his bones<br>
And stript his face of gristle, till he was<br>
Skull and half skeleton and yet alive.<br>
You're not for dealing in new gods?</blockquote><br>


<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>                   Not I.<br>
Was the man killed? </blockquote><br>


<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>      He lived a little while;<br>
But the flies killed him.</blockquote><br>


<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>            Flies? I hope India<br>
Is not a fly-plagued land? I abhor flies.</blockquote><br>


<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>You will see strange ones, for our Indian life<br>
Hath wonderful fierce breeding. Common earth<br>
With us quickens to buzzing flights of wings<br>
As readily as a week-old carcase here<br>
Thrown in a sunny marsh. Why, we have wasps<br>
That make your hornets seem like pretty midges;<br>
And there be flies in India will drink<br>
Not only blood of bulls, tigers, and bears,<br>
But pierce the river-horses' creasy leather,<br>
Ay, worry crocodiles through their cuirasses<br>
And prick the metal fishes when they bask.<br>
You'll feel them soon, with beaks like sturdy pins,<br>
Treating their stinging thirsts with your best blood.<br>
A man can't walk a mile in India<br>
Without being the business of a throng'd<br>
And moving town of flies; they hawk at a man<br>
As bold as little eagles, and as wild.<br>
And, I suppose, only a fool will blame them.<br>
Flies have the right to sink wells in our skin<br>
All as men to bore parcht earth for water.<br>
But I must do a job on board, and then<br>
Search the town afresh for a carpenter.</blockquote><br>


<i>Thomas (alone):</i>

<blockquote>Ay, loose tongue, I know how thou art prompted.<br>
Satan's cunning device thou art, to sap<br>
My heart with chatter'd fears. How easy it is<br>
For a stiff mind to hold itself upright<br>
Against the cords of devilish suggestion<br>
Tackled about it, though kept downward strained<br>
With sly, masterful winches made of fear.<br>
Yea, when the mind is warned what engines mean<br>
To ply it into grovelling, and thought set firm,<br>
The tugging strings fail like a cobweb-stuff.<br>
Not as in Baghdad is it with me now;<br>
Nor canst thou, Satan, by a prating mouth<br>
Fell my tall purpose to a flatlong scorn.<br>
I can divide the check of God's own hand<br>
From tempting such as this: India is mine! &mdash; <br>
Ay, fiend, and if thou utter thy storming heart<br>
Into the ocean sea, as into mob<br>
A rebel utters turbulence and rage,<br>
And raise before my path swelling barriers<br>
Of hatred soul'd in water, yet will I strike<br>
My purpose, and God's purpose, clean through all<br>
The ridges of thy power. And I will show<br>
This mask that the devil wears, this old shipman,<br>
A thing to make his proud heart of evil<br>
Writhe like a trodden snake; yea, he shall see<br>
How godly faith can go upon the huge<br>
Fury of forces bursting out of law,<br>
Easily as a boy goes on windy grass. &mdash; <br>
O marvel! that my little life of mind<br>
Can by mere thinking the unsizeable<br>
Creature of sea enslave! I must believe it.<br>
The mind hath many powers beyond name<br>
Deep womb'd within it, and can shoot strange vigours:<br>
Men there have been who could so grimly look<br>
That soldiers' hearts went out like candle flames<br>
Before their eyes, and the blood perisht in them. &mdash; <br>
But I &mdash; could I do that? Would I not feel    <br>
The power in me if 'twas there? And yet     <br>
'Twere a child's game to what I have to do,    <br>
For days and days with sleepless faith oppress<br>
And terrorise the demon sea. I think<br>
A man might, as I saw my Master once,<br>
Pass unharmed through a storm of men, yet fail<br>
At this that lies before me: men are mind,<br>
And mind can conquer mind; but how can it quell<br>
The unappointed purpose of great waters? &mdash; <br>
Well, say the sea is past: why, then I have<br>
My feet but on the threshold of my task,<br>
To gospel India, &mdash; my single heart<br>
To seize into the order of its beat<br>
All the strange blood of India, my brain<br>
To lord the dark thought of that tann'd mankind! &mdash; <br>
O horrible those sweltry places are,<br>
Where the sun comes so close, it makes the earth<br>
Burn in a frenzy of breeding, &mdash; smoke and flame<br>
Of lives burning up from agoniz'd loam!<br>
Those monstrous sappy jungles of clutcht growth,<br>
Enormous weed hugging enormous weed,<br>
What can such fearful increase have to do<br>
With prospering bounty? A rage works in the ground,<br>
Incurably, like frantic lechery,<br>
Pouring its passion out in crops and spawns.<br>
'Tis as the mighty spirit of life, that here<br>
Walketh beautifully praising, glad of God,<br>
Should, stepping on the poison'd Indian shore,<br>
Breathing the Indian air of fire and steams,<br>
Fling herself into a craze of hideous dancing,<br>
The green gown whipping her swift limbs, all her body<br>
Writhen to speak inutterable desire,<br>
Tormented by a glee of hating God.<br>
Nay, it must be, to visit India,<br>
That frantic pomp and hurrying forth of life,<br>
As if a man should enter at unawares<br>
The dreaming mind of Satan, gorgeously<br>
Imagining his eternal hell of lust. &mdash; <br><br>

  They say the land is full of apes, which have<br>
Their own gods and worship; how ghastly, this! &mdash; <br>
That demons (for it must be so) should build,<br>
In mockery of man's upward faith, the souls<br>
Of monkeys, those lewd mammets of mankind,<br>
Into a dreadful farce of adoration!<br>
And flies! a land of flies! where the hot soil<br>
Foul with ceaseless decay steams into flies!<br>
So thick they pile themselves in the air above<br>
Their meal of filth, they seem like breathing heaps<br>
Of formless life mounded upon the earth;<br>
And buzzing always like the pipes and strings<br>
Of solemn music made for sorcerers. &mdash; <br>
I abhor flies, &mdash; to see them stare upon me<br>
Out of their little faces of gibbous eyes;<br>
To feel the dry cool skin of their bodies alight<br>
Perching upon my lips! &mdash; O yea, a dream,<br>
A dream of impious obscene Satan, this<br>
Monstrous frenzy of life, the Indian being!<br>
And there are men in the dream! What men are they?<br>
I've heard, naught relishes their brains so much<br>
As to tie down a man and tease his flesh<br>
Infamously, until a hundred pains<br>
Hound the desiring life out of his body,<br>
Filling his nerves with such a fearful zest<br>
That the soul overstrained shatters beneath it.<br>
Must I preach God to these murderous hearts?<br>
I would my lot had fallen to go and dare<br>
Death from the silent dealing of Northern cold! &mdash; <br><br>

  O, but I would face all these Indian fears,   <br>
The horror of the huge power of life,      <br>
The beasts all fierce and venomous, the men   <br>
With cruel souls, learned to invent pain,<br>
All these and more, if I had any hope<br>
That, braving them, Lord Christ prosper'd through me.<br>
If Christ desired India, He had sent<br>
The band of us, solder'd in one great purpose,<br>
To strike His message through those dark vast tribes<br>
But one man! &mdash; O surely it is folly,<br>
And we misread the lot! One man, to thrust,<br>
Even though in his soul the lamp was kindled<br>
At God's own hands, one man's lit soul to thrust<br>
The immense Indian darkness out of the world!<br>
For human flesh there breeds as furiously<br>
As the green things and the cattle; and it is all,<br>
All this enormity of measureless folk,<br>
Penn'd in a land so close to the devil's reign<br>
The very apes have faith in him. &mdash; No, no;<br>
Impetuous brains mistake the signs of God<br>
Too easily. God would not have me waste<br>
My zeal for Him in this wild enterprise,<br>
Of going alone to swarming India; &mdash; one man,<br>
One mortal voice, to charm those myriad ears<br>
Away from the fiendish clamour of Indian gods,<br>
One man preaching the truth against the huge<br>
Bray of the gongs and horns of the Indian priests!<br>
A cup of wine poured in the sea were not<br>
More surely lost in the green and brackish depths,<br>
Than the fire and fragrance of my doctrine poured<br>
Into that multitudinous pond of men,<br>
India. &mdash; Shipman! Master of the ship! &mdash; <br>
I have thought better of this journey; now<br>
I find I am not meant to go.</blockquote><br>


<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote> Not meant?</blockquote><br>


<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>I would say, I had forgotten Indian air<br>
Is full of fevers; and my health is bad<br>
For holding out against fever.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>              As you please.<br>
I keep your fare, though.</blockquote><br>


<i>Thomas:</i>

<blockquote>O, 'tis yours. &mdash; Good sailing!</blockquote><br>

<i>As he makes to depart, a Noble Stranger is
seen approaching along the quay.</i><br>
<br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>Well, here's a marvel: 'Tis a king, for sure!<br>
'Twould take the taxes of a world to dress<br>
A man in that silken gold, and all those gems.<br>
What a flash the light makes of him; nay, he burns;<br>
And he's here on the quay all by himself,<br>
Not even a slave to fan him! &mdash; Man, you're ailing!<br>
You look like death; is it the falling sickness?<br>
Or has the mere thought of the Indian journey<br>
Made your marrow quail with a cold fever?</blockquote><br>

<i>The Stranger: (to the Captain)</i>

<blockquote>You are the master of this ship?</blockquote><br>


<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>I am.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>This huddled man belongs to me: a slave<br>
Escaped my service.</blockquote><br>


<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>    Lord, I knew not that.<br>
But you are in good time.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>             And was the slave  <br>
For putting out with you? Where are you bound?</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>To India. First he would sail, and then<br>
Again he would not. But, my Lord, I swear<br>
I never guesst he was a runaway.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>Well, he shall have his mind and go with you<br>
To India: a good slave he is, but bears<br>
A restless thought. He has slipt off before,<br>
And vexes me still to be watching him.<br>
We'll make a bargain of him.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>I, my Lord?<br>
I have no need of slaves: I am too poor.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>For twenty silver pieces he is yours.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>That's cheap, if he has skill. Yes, there might be<br>
Profit in him at that. Has he a trade?</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>He is a carpenter.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>     A carpenter!<br>
Why, for a good one I'ld give all my purse.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>No, twenty silver pieces is the price;<br>
Though 'tis a slave a king might joy to own.<br>
I've taught him to imagine palaces<br>
So high, and tower'd so nobly, they might seem<br>
The marvelling of a God-delighted heart<br>
Escaping into ecstasy; he knows,<br>
Moreover, of a stuff so rare it makes<br>
Smaragdus and the dragon-stone despised;<br>
And yet the quarries whereof he is wise<br>
Would yield enough to house the tribes of the world<br>
In palaces of beautiful shining work.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>Lo there! why, that is it: the carpenter<br>
I am to bring is needed for to build<br>
The king's new palace.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>Yea? He is your man.</blockquote><br>

<i>Captain:</i>

<blockquote>Come on, my man. I'll put your cunning heels<br>
Where they'll not budge more than a shuffled inch.<br>
My lord, if you'll bide with the rascal here<br>
I'll get the irons ready. Here's your sum. &mdash; </blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>Now, Thomas, know thy sin. It was not fear;<br>
Easily may a man crouch down for fear,<br>
And yet rise up on firmer knees, and face<br>
The hailing storm of the world with graver courage.<br>
But prudence, prudence is the deadly sin,<br>
And one that groweth deep into a life,<br>
With hardening roots that clutch about the breast.<br>
For this refuses faith in the unknown powers<br>
Within man's nature; shrewdly bringeth all<br>
Their inspiration of strange eagerness<br>
To a judgment bought by safe experience;<br>
Narrows desire into the scope of thought.<br>
But it is written in the heart of man,      <br>
Thou shalt no larger be than thy desire.     <br>
Thou must not therefore stoop thy spirit's sight <br>
To pore only within the candle-gleam<br>
Of conscious wit and reasonable brain;<br>
But search into the sacred darkness lying<br>
Outside thy knowledge of thyself, the vast<br>
Measureless fate, full of the power of stars,<br>
The outer noiseless heavens of thy soul.<br>
Keep thy desire closed in the room of light<br>
The labouring fires of thy mind have made,<br>
And thou shalt find the vision of thy spirit<br>
Pitifully dazzled to so shrunk a ken,<br>
There are no spacious puissances about it,<br>
But send desire often forth to scan<br>
The immense night which is thy greater soul;<br>
Knowing the possible, see thou try beyond it<br>
Into impossible things, unlikely ends;<br>
And thou shalt find thy knowledgeable desire<br>
Grow large as all the regions of thy soul,<br>
Whose firmament doth cover the whole of Being,<br>
And of created purpose reach the ends.</blockquote>

<h3>The End of the World</h3>

<blockquote>The snow had fallen many nights and days;     <br>
The sky was come upon the earth at last,<br>
Sifting thinly down as endlessly<br>
As though within the system of blind planets<br>
Something had been forgot or overdriven.<br>
The dawn now seemed neglected in the grey<br>
Where mountains were unbuilt and shadowless trees<br>
Rootlessly paused or hung upon the air.<br>
There was no wind, but now and then a sigh<br>
Crossed that dry falling dust and rifted it<br>
Through crevices of slate and door and casement.<br>
Perhaps the new moon's time was even past.<br>
Outside, the first white twilights were too void<br>
Until a sheep called once, as to a lamb,<br>
And tenderness crept everywhere from it;<br>
But now the flock must have strayed far away.<br>
The lights across the valley must be veiled,<br>
The smoke lost in the greyness or the dusk.<br>
For more than three days now the snow had thatched<br>
That cow-house roof where it had ever melted<br>
With yellow stains from the beasts' breath inside;<br>
But yet a dog howled there, though not quite lately.<br>
Someone passed down the valley swift and singing.<br>
Yes, with locks spreaded like a son of morning;<br>
But if he seemed too tall to be a man<br>
It was that men had been so long unseen,<br>
Or shapes loom larger through a moving snow.<br>
And he was gone and food had not been given him. <br>
When snow slid from an overweighted leaf,<br>
Shaking the tree, it might have been a bird<br>
Slipping in sleep or shelter, whirring wings;<br>
Yet never bird fell out, save once a dead one &mdash; <br>
And in two days the snow had covered it.<br>
The dog had howled again &mdash; or thus it seemed<br>
Until a lean fox passed and cried no more.<br>
All was so safe indoors where life went on<br>
Glad of the close enfolding snow &mdash; O glad<br>
To be so safe and secret at its heart,<br>
Watching the strangeness of familiar things.<br>
They knew not what dim hours went on, went by,<br>
For while they slept the clock stopt newly wound<br>
As the cold hardened. Once they watched the road,<br>
Thinking to be remembered. Once they doubted<br>
If they had kept the sequence of the days,<br>
Because they heard not any sound of bells.<br>
A butterfly, that hid until the Spring<br>
Under a ceiling's shadow, dropt, was dead.<br>
The coldness seemed more nigh, the coldness deepened<br>
As a sound deepens into silences;<br>
It was of earth and came not by the air;<br>
The earth was cooling and drew down the sky.<br>
The air was crumbling. There was no more sky.<br>
Rails of a broken bed charred in the grate,<br>
And when he touched the bars he thought the sting<br>
Came from their heat &mdash; he could not feel such cold ...<br>
She said 'O, do not sleep,<br>
Heart, heart of mine, keep near me. No, no; sleep.<br>
I will not lift his fallen, quiet eyelids,<br>
Although I know he would awaken then &mdash; <br>
He closed them thus but now of his own will.<br>
He can stay with me while I do not lift them.'</blockquote>

Of the new threatening sky, and first rude digits<br>
Of awe remonstrance and uneasy power<br>
Thrust out by man when speech sank back in his throat:<br>
Then had the last rocks ended bubbling up<br>
And rhythms of change within the heart begun<br>
By a blind need that would make Springs and Winters;<br>
Pylons and monoliths went on by ages,<br>
Mycenae and Great Zimbabwe came about;<br>
Cowed hearts in This conceived a pyramid<br>
That leaned to hold itself upright, a thing<br>
Foredoomed to limits, death and an easy apex;<br>
Then postulants for the stars' previous wisdom<br>
Standing on Carthage must get nearer still;<br>
While in Chaldea an altitude of god<br>
Being mooted, and a saurian unearthed<br>
Upon a mountain stirring a surmise<br>
Of floods and alterations of the sea,<br>
A round-walled tower must rise upon Senaar<br>
Temple and escape to god the ascertained.<br>
These are decayed like Time's teeth in his mouth,<br>
Black cavities and gaps, yet earth is darkened<br>
By their deep-sunken and unfounded shadows<br>
And memories of man's earliest theme of towers.<br><br>

Space &mdash; the old source of time &mdash; should be undone,<br>
Eternity defined, by men who trusted<br>
Another tier would equal them with god.<br>
A city of grimed brick-kilns, squat truncations,<br>
Hunched like spread toads yet high beneath their circles<br>
Of low packed smoke, assemblages of thunder<br>
That glowed upon their under sides by night<br>
And lit like storm small shadowless workmen's toil.<br>
Meaningless stumps, upturned bare roots, remained<br>
In fields of mashy mud and trampled leaves;<br>
While, if a horse died hauling, plasterers<br>
Knelt on a flank to clip its sweaty coat.<br><br>

A builder leans across the last wide courses;<br>
His unadjustable unreaching eyes<br>
Fail under him before his glances sink<br>
On the clouds' upper layers of sooty curls<br>
Where some long lightning goes like swallows downward,<br>
But at the wider gallery next below<br>
Recognise master-masons with pricked parchments:<br>
That builder then, as one who condescends<br>
Unto the sea and all that is beneath him,<br>
His hairy breast on the wet mortar, calls<br>
'How many fathoms is it yet to heaven!'<br>
On the next eminence the orgulous king<br>
Nimroud stands up conceiving he shall live<br>
To conquer god, now that he knows where god is:<br>
His eager hands push up the tower in thought ...<br>
Again, his shaggy inhuman height strides down<br>
Among the carpenters because he has seen<br>
One shape an eagle-woman on a door-post:<br>
He drives his spear-beam through him for wasted day.<br><br>

Little men hurrying, running here and there,<br>
Within the dark and stifling walls, dissent<br>
From every sound, and shoulder empty hods:<br>
'The god's great altar should stand in the crypt<br>
Among our earth's foundations' &mdash; 'The god's great altar<br>
Must be the last far coping of our work' &mdash; <br>
It should inaugurate the broad main stair' &mdash; <br>
'Or end it' &mdash; 'It must stand toward the East!'   <br>
But here a grave contemptuous youth cries out   <br>
'Womanish babblers, how can we build god's altar  <br>
Ere we divine its foreordained true shape?'<br>
Then one 'It is a pedestal for deeds' &mdash; <br>
''Tis more and should be hewn like the king's brow' &mdash; <br>
'It has the nature of a woman's bosom' &mdash; <br>
'The tortoise, first created, signifies it' &mdash; <br>
'A blind and rudimentary navel shows<br>
The source of worship better than horned moons.'<br>
Then a lean giant 'Is not a calyx needful?' &mdash; <br>
'Because round grapes on statues well expressed<br>
Become the nadir of incense, nodal lamps,<br>
Yet apes have hands that cut and carved red crystal' &mdash; <br>
'Birds molten, touchly talc veins bronze buds crumble<br>
Ablid ublai ghan isz rad eighar ghaurl ...'<br>
Words said too often seemed such ancient sounds<br>
That men forgot them or were lost in them;<br>
The guttural glottis-chasms of language reached,<br>
A rhythm, a gasp, were curves of immortal thought.<br><br>

Man with his bricks was building, building yet,<br>
Where dawn and midnight mingled and woke no birds,<br>
In the last courses, building past his knowledge<br>
A wall that swung &mdash; for towers can have no tops,<br>
No chord can mete the universal segment,<br>
Earth has not basis. Yet the yielding sky,<br>
Invincible vacancy, was there discovered &mdash; <br>
Though piled-up bricks should pulp the sappy balks,<br>
Weight generate a secrecy of heat,<br>
Cankerous charring, crevices' fronds of flame.</blockquote><br>

And of <i>that</i> district I prefer<br>
The lovely hamlet Grantchester.<br>
For Cambridge people rarely smile,<br>
Being urban, squat, and packed with guile;<br>
And Royston men in the far South<br>
Are black and fierce and strange of mouth;<br>
At Over they fling oaths at one,<br>
And worse than oaths at Trumpington,<br>
And Ditton girls are mean and dirty,<br>
And there's none in Harston under thirty,<br>
And folks in Shelford and those parts<br>
Have twisted lips and twisted hearts,<br>
And Barton men make cockney rhymes,<br>
And Coton's full of nameless crimes,<br>
And things are done you'd not believe<br>
At Madingley on Christmas Eve.<br>
Strong men have run for miles and miles<br>
When one from Cherry Hinton smiles;<br>
Strong men have blanched and shot their wives<br>
Rather than send them to St. Ives;<br>
Strong men have cried like babes, bydam,<br>
To hear what happened at Babraham.<br>
But Grantchester! ah, Grantchester!<br>
There's peace and holy quiet there,<br>
Great clouds along pacific skies,<br>
And men and women with straight eyes,<br>
Lithe children lovelier than a dream,<br>
A bosky wood, a slumbrous stream,<br>
And little kindly winds that creep<br>
Round twilight corners, half asleep.<br>
In Grantchester their skins are white,<br>
They bathe by day, they bathe by night;<br>
The women there do all they ought;<br>
The men observe the Rules of Thought.<br>
They love the Good; they worship Truth;<br>
They laugh uproariously in youth;<br>
(And when they get to feeling old,<br>
They up and shoot themselves, I'm told)...<br><br>

Ah God! to see the branches stir<br>
Across the moon at Grantchester!<br>
To smell the thrilling-sweet and rotten<br>
Unforgettable, unforgotten<br>
River smell, and hear the breeze<br>
Sobbing in the little trees.<br>
Say, do the elm-clumps greatly stand,<br>
Still guardians of that holy land?<br>
The chestnuts shade, in reverend dream,<br>
The yet unacademic stream?<br>
Is dawn a secret shy and cold<br>
Anadyomene, silver-gold?<br>
And sunset still a golden sea<br>
From Haslingfield to Madingley?<br>
And after, ere the night is born,<br>
Do hares come out about the corn?<br>
Oh, is the water sweet and cool         <br>
Gentle and brown, above the pool?       <br>
And laughs the immortal river still<br>
Under the mill, under the mill?<br>
Say, is there Beauty yet to find?<br>
And Certainty? and Quiet kind?<br>
Deep meadows yet, for to forget<br>
The lies, and truths, and pain?... oh! yet<br>
Stands the Church clock at ten to three?<br>
And is there honey still for tea?</blockquote><br>

Has stilled the labour of my breath &mdash; <br>
  When we are dust, when we are dust! &mdash; <br><br>

Not dead, not undesirous yet,<br>
  Still sentient, still unsatisfied,<br>
We'll ride the air, and shine, and flit,<br>

Upon the peace; and, past desiring,<br>
  So high a beauty in the air,<br>
And such a light, and such a quiring,<br>
  And such a radiant ecstasy there,<br><br>

  Or out of earth, or in the height,<br>
Singing, or flame, or scent, or hue,<br>
  Or two that pass, in light, to light,<br><br>

Out of the garden, higher, higher ...<br>
  But in that instant they shall learn<br>
The shattering fury of our fire,<br>
  And the weak passionless hearts will burn<br><br>

And faint in that amazing glow,<br>
  Until the darkness close above;<br>
And they will know &mdash; poor fools, they'll know! &mdash; <br>
  One moment, what it is to love.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>In a cool curving world he lies<br>
And ripples with dark ecstasies.<br>
The kind luxurious lapse and steal<br>
Shapes all his universe to feel<br>
And know and be; the clinging stream<br>
Closes his memory, glooms his dream,<br>
Who lips the roots o' the shore, and glides<br>
Superb on unreturning tides.<br>
Those silent waters weave for him<br>
A fluctuant mutable world and dim,<br>
Where wavering masses bulge and gape<br>
Mysterious, and shape to shape<br>
Dies momently through whorl and hollow,<br>
And form and line and solid follow<br>
Solid and line and form to dream<br>
Fantastic down the eternal stream;<br>
An obscure world, a shifting world,<br>
Bulbous, or pulled to thin, or curled,<br>
Or serpentine, or driving arrows,<br>
Or serene slidings, or March narrows.<br>
There slipping wave and shore are one,<br>
And weed and mud. No ray of sun,<br>
But glow to glow fades down the deep<br>
(As dream to unknown dream in sleep);<br>
Shaken translucency illumes<br>
The hyaline of drifting glooms;<br>
The strange soft-handed depth subdues<br>
Drowned colour there, but black to hues,<br>
As death to living, decomposes &mdash; <br>
Red darkness of the heart of roses,<br>
Blue brilliant from dead starless skies,<br>
And gold that lies behind the eyes,<br>
The unknown unnameable sightless white<br>

Lustreless purple, hooded green,<br>
The myriad hues that lie between<br>
Darkness and darkness!...<br><br>

Gentle, embracing, quiet, dun,<br>

Perpetual curving. Only &mdash; grows<br>
An eddy in that ordered falling,<br>
A knowledge from the gloom, a calling<br>
Weed in the wave, gleam in the mud &mdash; <br>
The dark fire leaps along his blood;<br>
Dateless and deathless, blind and still,<br>
The intricate impulse works its will;<br>
His woven world drops back; and he,<br>
Sans providence, sans memory,<br>
Unconscious and directly driven,<br>
Fades to some dank sufficient heaven.<br><br>

O world of lips, O world of laughter,<br>
Where hope is fleet and thought flies after,<br>
Of lights in the clear night, of cries<br>
That drift along the wave and rise<br>
Thin to the glittering stars above,<br>
You know the hands, the eyes of love!<br>
The strife of limbs, the sightless clinging,<br>
The infinite distance, and the singing<br>
Blown by the wind, a flame of sound,<br>
The gleam, the flowers, and vast around<br>
The horizon, and the heights above &mdash; <br>
You know the sigh, the song of love!<br><br>

But there the night is close, and there<br>
Darkness is cold and strange and bare;<br>
And the secret deeps are whisperless;<br>
And rhythm is all deliciousness;<br>
And joy is in the throbbing tide,<br>
Whose intricate fingers beat and glide<br>
In felt bewildering harmonies<br>
Of trembling touch; and music is<br>
The exquisite knocking of the blood.<br>
Space is no more, under the mud;<br>
His bliss is older than the sun.<br>
Silent and straight the waters run,<br>
The lights, the cries, the willows dim,<br>
And the dark tide are one with him.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>When you were there, and you, and you,<br>
Happiness crowned the night; I too,<br>
Laughing and looking, one of all,<br>
I watched the quivering lamplight fall<br>
On plate and flowers and pouring tea<br>
And cup and cloth; and they and we<br>
Flung all the dancing moments by<br>
With jest and glitter. Lip and eye<br>
Flashed on the glory, shone and cried,<br>
Improvident, unmemoried;<br>
And fitfully and like a flame<br>
The light of laughter went and came.<br>
Proud in their careless transience moved<br>
The changing faces that I loved.<br><br>

Till suddenly, and otherwhence,<br>
I looked upon your innocence;<br>
For lifted clear and still and strange<br>
From the dark woven flow of change<br>
Under a vast and starless sky <br>
I saw the immortal moment lie.<br>
One instant I, an instant, knew<br>
As God knows all. And it and you<br>
I, above Time, oh, blind! could see<br>
In witless immortality.<br>
I saw the marble cup; the tea,<br>
Hung on the air, an amber stream;<br>
I saw the fire's unglittering gleam,<br>
The painted flame, the frozen smoke.<br>
No more the flooding lamplight broke<br>
On flying eyes and lips and hair;<br>
But lay, but slept unbroken there,<br>
On stiller flesh, and body breathless,<br>
And lips and laughter stayed and deathless,<br>
And words on which no silence grew.<br>
Light was more alive than you.<br><br>

For suddenly, and otherwhence,<br>
I looked on your magnificence.<br>
I saw the stillness and the light,<br>
And you, august, immortal, white,<br>
Holy and strange; and every glint<br>
Posture and jest and thought and tint<br>
Freed from the mask of transiency,<br>
Triumphant in eternity,<br>
Immote, immortal.<br><br>

                   Dazed at length<br>
Human eyes grew, mortal strength<br>
Wearied; and Time began to creep.<br>
Change closed about me like a sleep.<br>
Light glinted on the eyes I loved.<br>
The cup was filled. The bodies moved.<br>
The drifting petal came to ground.<br>
The laughter chimed its perfect round.<br>
The broken syllable was ended.<br>
And I, so certain and so friended,<br>
How could I cloud, or how distress,<br>
The heaven of your unconsciousness?<br>
Or shake at Time's sufficient spell,<br>
Stammering of lights unutterable?<br>
The eternal holiness of you,<br>
The timeless end, you never knew,<br>
The peace that lay, the light that shone.<br>
You never knew that I had gone<br>
A million miles away, and stayed<br>
A million years. The laughter played<br>
Unbroken round me; and the jest<br>
Flashed on. And we that knew the best    <br>
Down wonderful hours grew happier yet.   <br>
I sang at heart, and talked, and eat,<br>
And lived from laugh to laugh, I too,<br>
When you were there, and you, and you.</blockquote>

<h3>The Song of Elf</h3>

<blockquote>Blue-eyed was Elf the minstrel,      <br>
  With womanish hair and ring,      <br>
Yet heavy was his hand on sword,<br>
  Though light upon the string.<br><br>

And as he stirred the strings of the harp<br>
  To notes but four or five,<br>
The heart of each man moved in him<br>
  Like a babe buried alive.<br><br>

And they felt the land of the folk-songs<br>
  Spread southward of the Dane,<br>
And they heard the good Rhine flowing<br>
  In the heart of all Allemagne.<br><br>

They felt the land of the folk-songs,<br>
  Where the gifts hang on the tree,<br>
Where the girls give ale at morning<br>
  And the tears come easily,<br><br>

The mighty people, womanlike,<br>
  That have pleasure in their pain;<br>
As he sang of Balder beautiful,<br>
  Whom the heavens loved in vain.<br><br>

As he sang of Balder beautiful,<br>

   When all the world goes well;<br>
A thing forgotten, as long ago<br>
When the gods forgot the mistletoe,<br>
And soundless as an arrow of snow<br>
  The arrow of anguish fell.<br><br>

'The thing on the blind side of the heart,<br>
  On the wrong side of the door;<br>
The green plant groweth, menacing<br>
Almighty lovers in the spring;<br>
There is always a forgotten thing,<br>
  And love is not secure.'</blockquote>

<br>
<h3>The Child and the Mariner</h3>

<blockquote>A dear old couple my grandparents were,    <br>
And kind to all dumb things; they saw in Heaven<br>
The lamb that Jesus petted when a child;<br>
Their faith was never draped by Doubt: to them<br>
Death was a rainbow in Eternity,<br>
That promised everlasting brightness soon.<br>
An old seafaring man was he; a rough<br>
Old man, but kind; and hairy, like the nut<br>
Full of sweet milk. All day on shore he watched<br>
The winds for sailors' wives, and told what ships<br>
Enjoyed fair weather, and what ships had storms;<br>
He watched the sky, and he could tell for sure<br>
What afternoons would follow stormy morns,<br>
If quiet nights would end wild afternoons.<br>
He leapt away from scandal with a roar,<br>
And if a whisper still possessed his mind,<br>
He walked about and cursed it for a plague.<br>
He took offence at Heaven when beggars passed,<br>
And sternly called them back to give them help.<br>
In this old captain's house I lived, and things<br>
That house contained were in ships' cabins once;<br>
Sea-shells and charts and pebbles, model ships;<br>
Green weeds, dried fishes stuffed, and coral stalks;<br>
Old wooden trunks with handles of spliced rope,<br>
With copper saucers full of monies strange,<br>
That seemed the savings of dead men, not touched<br>
To keep them warm since their real owners died;<br>
Strings of red beads, methought were dipped in blood,<br>
And swinging lamps, as though the house might move;<br>
An ivory lighthouse built on ivory rocks,<br>
The bones of fishes and three bottled ships.<br>
And many a thing was there which sailors make<br>
In idle hours, when on long voyages,<br>
Of marvellous patience, to no lovely end.<br>
And on those charts I saw the small black dots<br>
That were called islands, and I knew they had<br>
Turtles and palms, and pirates' buried gold.<br>
There came a stranger to my granddad's house,<br>
The old man's nephew, a seafarer too;<br>
A big, strong able man who could have walked<br>
Twm Barlum's hill all clad in iron mail;<br>
So strong he could have made one man his club<br>
To knock down others &mdash; Henry was his name,<br>
No other name was uttered by his kin.<br>
And here he was, insooth illclad, but oh,<br>
Thought I, what secrets of the sea are his!<br>
This man knows coral islands in the sea,<br>
And dusky girls heartbroken for white men;<br>
This sailor knows of wondrous lands afar,<br>
More rich than Spain, when the Phoenicians shipped<br>
Silver for common ballast, and they saw<br>
Horses at silver mangers eating grain;<br>
This man has seen the wind blow up a mermaid's hair<br>
Which, like a golden serpent, reared and stretched<br>
To feel the air away beyond her head.<br>
He begged my pennies, which I gave with joy &mdash; <br>
He will most certainly return some time<br>
A self-made king of some new land, and rich.<br>
Alas that he, the hero of my dreams,<br>
Should be his people's scorn; for they had rose<br>
To proud command of ships, whilst he had toiled<br>
Before the mast for years, and well content;<br>
Him they despised, and only Death could bring<br>
A likeness in his face to show like them.<br>
For he drank all his pay, nor went to sea<br>
As long as ale was easy got on shore.<br>
Now, in his last long voyage he had sailed<br>
From Plymouth Sound to where sweet odours fan<br>
The Cingalese at work, and then back home &mdash;   <br>
But came not near his kin till pay was spent.    <br>
He was not old, yet seemed so; for his face     <br>
Looked like the drowned man's in the morgue, when it<br>
Has struck the wooden wharves and keels of ships.<br>
And all his flesh was pricked with Indian ink,<br>
His body marked as rare and delicate<br>
As dead men struck by lightning under trees,<br>
And pictured with fine twigs and curlèd ferns;<br>
Chains on his neck and anchors on his arms;<br>
Rings on his fingers, bracelets on his wrist;<br>
And on his breast the Jane of Appledore<br>
Was schooner rigged, and in full sail at sea.<br>
He could not whisper with his strong hoarse voice,<br>
No more than could a horse creep quietly;<br>
He laughed to scorn the men that muffled close<br>
For fear of wind, till all their neck was hid,<br>
Like Indian corn wrapped up in long green leaves;<br>
He knew no flowers but seaweeds brown and green,<br>
He knew no birds but those that followed ships.<br>
Full well he knew the water-world; he heard<br>
A grander music there than we on land,<br>
When organ shakes a church; swore he would make<br>
The sea his home, though it was always roused<br>
By such wild storms as never leave Cape Horn;<br>
Happy to hear the tempest grunt and squeal<br>
Like pigs heard dying in a slaughterhouse.<br>
A true-born mariner, and this his hope &mdash; <br>
His coffin would be what his cradle was,<br>
A boat to drown in and be sunk at sea;<br>
To drown at sea and lie a dainty corpse<br>
Salted and iced in Neptune's larder deep.<br>
This man despised small coasters, fishing-smacks;<br>
He scorned those sailors who at night and morn<br>
Can see the coast, when in their little boats<br>
They go a six days' voyage and are back<br>
Home with their wives for every Sabbath day.<br>
Much did he talk of tankards of old beer,<br>
And bottled stuff he drank in other lands,<br>
Which was a liquid fire like Hell to gulp,<br>
But Paradise to sip.<br><br>

                      And so he talked;<br>
Nor did those people listen with more awe<br>
To Lazarus &mdash; whom they had seen stone dead &mdash; <br>
Than did we urchins to that seaman's voice.<br>
He many a tale of wonder told: of where,<br>
At Argostoli, Cephalonia's sea<br>
Ran over the earth's lip in heavy floods;<br>
And then again of how the strange Chinese<br>
Conversed much as our homely Blackbirds sing.<br>
He told us how he sailed in one old ship<br>
Near that volcano Martinique, whose power<br>
Shook like dry leaves the whole Carribean seas;<br>
And made the sun set in a sea of fire<br>
Which only half was his; and dust was thick<br>
On deck, and stones were pelted at the mast.<br>
So, as we walked along, that seaman dropped<br>
Into my greedy ears such words that sleep<br>
Stood at my pillow half the night perplexed.<br>
He told how isles sprang up and sank again,<br>
Between short voyages, to his amaze;<br>
How they did come and go, and cheated charts;<br>
Told how a crew was cursed when one man killed<br>
A bird that perched upon a moving barque;<br>
And how the sea's sharp needles, firm and strong,<br>
Ripped open the bellies of big, iron ships;<br>
Of mighty icebergs in the Northern seas,<br>
That haunt the far horizon like white ghosts,<br>
He told of waves that lift a ship so high<br>
That birds could pass from starboard unto port<br>
Under her dripping keel.<br><br>

                         Oh, it was sweet<br>
To hear that seaman tell such wondrous tales:<br>
How deep the sea in parts, that drownèd men<br>
Must go a long way to their graves and sink<br>
Day after day, and wander with the tides.<br>
He spake of his own deeds; of how he sailed<br>
One summer's night along the Bosphorus,<br>
And he &mdash; who knew no music like the wash<br>
Of waves against a ship, or wind in shrouds &mdash; <br>
Heard then the music on that woody shore<br>
Of nightingales, and feared to leave the deck,<br>
He thought 'twas sailing into Paradise.<br>
To hear these stories all we urchins placed<br>
Our pennies in that seaman's ready hand;<br>
Until one morn he signed for a long cruise,<br>
And sailed away &mdash; we never saw him more.<br>
Could such a man sink in the sea unknown?<br>
Nay, he had found a land with something rich,<br>
That kept his eyes turned inland for his life.<br>
'A damn bad sailor and a landshark too,<br>
No good in port or out' &mdash; my granddad said.</blockquote><br>

On lawns as smooth as shining glass,<br>

Get thee on boughs and clap thy wings<br>
Before the windows of proud kings.<br><br>

Nay, lovely Bird, thou art not vain;<br>
  Thou hast no proud, ambitious mind;<br>
I also love a quiet place<br>
  That's green, away from all mankind;<br>
A lonely pool, and let a tree<br>
Sigh with her bosom over me.</blockquote>

<h3>Arabia</h3>

<blockquote>Far are the shades of Arabia,        <br>
  Where the Princes ride at noon,<br>
'Mid the verdurous vales and thickets,<br>
  Under the ghost of the moon;<br>
And so dark is that vaulted purple<br>
  Flowers in the forest rise<br>
And toss into blossom 'gainst the phantom stars<br>
  Pale in the noonday skies.<br><br>

Sweet is the music of Arabia<br>
  In my heart, when out of dreams<br>
I still in the thin clear mirk of dawn<br>
  Descry her gliding streams;<br>
Hear her strange lutes on the green banks<br>
  Ring loud with the grief and delight<br>
Of the dim-silked, dark-haired Musicians<br>
  In the brooding silence of night.<br><br>

They haunt me &mdash; her lutes and her forests;<br>
  No beauty on earth I see<br>
But shadowed with that dream recalls<br>
  Her loveliness to me:<br>
Still eyes look coldly upon me,<br>
  Cold voices whisper and say &mdash; <br>
He is crazed with the spell of far Arabia,<br>
  They have stolen his wits away.'</blockquote><br>

<br>
<blockquote>As Ann came in one summer's day,<br>
  She felt that she must creep,<br>
So silent was the clear cool house,<br>
  It seemed a house of sleep.<br>
And sure, when she pushed open the door,<br>
  Rapt in the stillness there,<br>
Her mother sat, with stooping head,<br>
  Asleep upon a chair;<br>
Fast &mdash; fast asleep; her two hands laid<br>
  Loose-folded on her knee,<br>
So that her small unconscious face<br>
  Looked half unreal to be:<br>
So calmly lit with sleep's pale light<br>
  Each feature was; so fair<br>
Her forehead &mdash; every trouble was<br>
  Smooth'd out beneath her hair.<br><br>

But though her mind in dream now moved,<br>
  Still seemed her gaze to rest<br>
From out beneath her fast-sealed lids,<br>
  Above her moving breast,<br>
On Ann, as quite, quite still she stood;<br>
  Yet slumber lay so deep<br>
Even her hands upon her lap<br>
  Seemed saturate with sleep.<br>
And as Ann peeped, a cloudlike dread<br>
  Stole over her, and then,<br>
On stealthy, mouselike feet she trod,<br>
  And tiptoed out again.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>Dark frost was in the air without,     <br>
The dusk was still with cold and gloom,<br>
When less than even a shadow came<br>
  And stood within the room.<br><br>

But of the three around the fire,<br>
None turned a questioning head to look,<br>
Still read a clear voice, on and on,<br>
  Still stooped they o'er their book.<br><br>

The children watched their mother's eyes<br>
Moving on softly line to line;<br>
It seemed to listen too &mdash; that shade,<br>
  Yet made no outward sign.<br><br>

The fire-flames crooned a tiny song,<br>
No cold wind moved the wintry tree;<br>
The children both in Faerie dreamed<br>
  Beside their mother's knee.<br><br>

And nearer yet that spirit drew<br>
Above that heedless one, intent<br>
Only on what the simple words<br>
  Of her small story meant.<br><br>

No voiceless sorrow grieved her mind,<br>
No memory her bosom stirred,<br>
Nor dreamed she, as she read to two,<br>
  'Twas surely three who heard.<br><br>

Yet when, the story done, she smiled<br>
From face to face, serene and clear,<br>
A love, half dread, sprang up, as she<br>
  Leaned close and drew them near.</blockquote><br>

I see most clearly poor Miss Loo,<br>
Her tabby cat, her cage of birds,<br>
Her nose, her hair &mdash; her muffled words,<br>
And how she'd open her green eyes,<br>
As if in some immense surprise,<br>
Whenever as we sat at tea,<br>
She made some small remark to me.<br><br>

It's always drowsy summer when<br>
From out the past she comes again;<br>
The westering sunshine in a pool<br>
Floats in her parlour still and cool;<br>
While the slim bird its lean wires shakes,<br>
As into piercing song it breaks;<br>
Till Peter's pale-green eyes ajar<br>
Dream, wake; wake, dream, in one brief bar;<br>
And I am sitting, dull and shy,<br>
And she with gaze of vacancy,<br>
And large hands folded on the tray,<br>
Musing the afternoon away;<br>
Her satin bosom heaving slow<br>
With sighs that softly ebb and flow,<br>
And her plain face in such dismay,<br>
It seems unkind to look her way:<br>
Until all cheerful back will come<br>
Her cheerful gleaming spirit home:<br>
And one would think that poor Miss Loo<br>
Asked nothing else, if she had you.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>'Is there anybody there?' said the Traveller,<br>
  Knocking on the moonlit door;<br>
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses<br>
  Of the forest's ferny floor:<br>
And a bird flew up out of the turret,<br>
  Above the Traveller's head:<br>
And he smote upon the door again a second time;<br>
  'Is there anybody there?' he said.<br>
But no one descended to the Traveller;<br>
  No head from the leaf-fringed sill<br>
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,<br>
  Where he stood perplexed and still.<br>
But only a host of phantom listeners<br>
  That dwelt in the lone house then<br>
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight<br>
  To that voice from the world of men:<br>
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,<br>
  That goes down to the empty hall,<br>
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken<br>
  By the lonely Traveller's call.<br>
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,<br>
  Their stillness answering his cry,<br>
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,<br>
  'Neath the starred and leafy sky;<br>
For he suddenly smote on the door, even<br>
  Louder, and lifted his head: &mdash; <br>
'Tell them I came, and no one answered,<br>
  That I kept my word,' he said.<br>
Never the least stir made the listeners,<br>
  Though every word he spake<br>
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house<br>
  From the one man left awake:<br>
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,<br>
  And the sound of iron on stone,<br>
And how the silence surged softly backward,<br>
  When the plunging hoofs were gone.</blockquote>

In witless hardihood<br>
With eyes on one sole changeless vision set &mdash; <br>
The deep disturbed fret<br>
Of men who made brief tarrying in hell<br>
On their earth-travelling.<br>
It was as though the lives of men should be<br>
Set circle-wise, whereof one little span<br>
Through which all passed was blackened with the wing<br>
Of perilous evil, bateless misery.<br>
But all beyond, making the whole complete<br>
O'er which the travelling feet<br>
Of every man<br>
Made way or ever he might come to death,<br>

Of honey-laden flowers, and alive<br>

Dominion but in this most troubled place<br>
Where many a ruined grace<br>
And many a friendless care<br>
Ran to and fro in sorrowful unrest.<br>
Still in my hand I pressed<br>
Hope's fragile chalice, whence I drew deep draughts<br>
Shaping belief that even yet should grow<br>
Out of this dread confusion, as of broken crafts<br>
Driven along ungovernable seas,<br>
Some threads of order, and that I should know<br>
After long vigil all the mysteries<br>
Of human wonder and of human fate.<br><br>

O fool, O only great<br>
In pride unhallowed, O most blind of heart!<br>
Confusion but more dark confusion bred,<br>
Grief nurtured grief, I cried aloud and said,<br>
'Through trackless ways the soul of man is hurled,<br>
No sign upon the forehead of the skies,<br>
No beacon, and no chart<br>
Are given to him, and the inscrutable world<br>
But mocks his scars and fills his mouth with dust.'<br><br>

And one by one the stars blinked out;<br>
I knew 'twould only need the sun<br>
To send the shudders right about:<br>
And as the clear East faded white,<br>
I watched and wearied for the sun &mdash; <br>
The jolly, welcome, friendly sun &mdash; <br>
The sleepy sluggard of a sun<br>
That still kept snoozing out of sight,<br>
Though well he knew the night was done ...<br>
And after all, he caught me dozing,<br>
And leapt up, laughing, in the sky<br>
Just as my lazy eyes were closing:<br>
And it was good as gold to lie<br>
Full-length among the straw, and feel<br>
The day wax warmer every minute,<br>
As, glowing glad, from head to heel.<br>
I soaked, and rolled rejoicing in it ...<br>
When from, the corner of my eye,<br>
Upon a heathery knowe hard-by,<br>
With long lugs cocked, and eyes astare,<br>
Yet all serene, I saw a hare.<br><br>

Upon my belly in the straw,<br>
I lay, and watched her sleek her fur,<br>
As, daintily, with well-licked paw,<br>
She washed her face and neck and ears:<br>
Then, clean and comely in the sun,<br>
She kicked her heels up, full of fun,<br>
As if she did not care a pin<br>
Though she should jump out of her skin,<br>
And leapt and lolloped, free of fears,<br>
Until my heart frisked round with her.<br><br>

'And yet, if I but lift my head,<br>
You'll scamper off, young Puss,' I said.<br>
'Still, I can't lie, and watch you play,<br>
Upon my belly half the day.<br>
The Lord alone knows where I'm going:<br>
But, I had best be getting there.<br>
Last night I loosed you from the snare &mdash; <br>
Asleep, or waking, who's for knowing! &mdash; <br>
So, I shall thank you now for showing      <br>
Which art to take to bring me where      <br>
My luck awaits me. When you're ready     <br>
To start, I'll follow on your track.<br>
Though slow of foot, I'm sure and steady ...'<br>
She pricked her ears, then set them back;<br>
And like a shot was out of sight:<br>
And, with a happy heart and light,<br>
As quickly I was on my feet;<br>
And following the way she went,<br>
Keen as a lurcher on the scent,<br>
Across the heather and the bent,<br>
Across the quaking moss and peat.<br>
Of course, I lost her soon enough,<br>
For moorland tracks are steep and rough;<br>
And hares are made of nimbler stuff<br>
Than any lad of seventeen,<br>
However lanky-legged and tough,<br>
However kestrel-eyed and keen:<br>
And I'd at last to stop and eat<br>
The little bit of bread and meat<br>
Left in my pocket overnight.<br>
So, in a hollow, snug and green,<br>
I sat beside a burn, and dipped<br>
The dry bread in an icy pool;<br>
And munched a breakfast fresh and cool ...<br>
And then sat gaping like a fool ...<br>
For, right before my very eyes,<br>
With lugs acock and eyes astare,<br>
I saw again the selfsame hare.<br><br>

So, up I jumped, and off she slipped;<br>
And I kept sight of her until<br>
I stumbled in a hole, and tripped,<br>
And came a heavy, headlong spill;<br>
And she, ere I'd the wit to rise,<br>
Was o'er the hill, and out of sight:<br>
And, sore and shaken with the tumbling,<br>
And sicker at my foot for stumbling,<br>
I cursed my luck, and went on, grumbling,<br>
The way her flying heels had fled.<br><br>

The sky was cloudless overhead,<br>
And just alive with larks asinging;<br>
And in a twinkling I was swinging<br>
Across the windy hills, lighthearted.<br>
A kestrel at my footstep started,<br>
Just pouncing on a frightened mouse,<br>
And hung o'er head with wings a-hover;<br>
Through rustling heath an adder darted:<br>
A hundred rabbits bobbed to cover:<br>
A weasel, sleek and rusty-red,<br>
Popped out of sight as quick as winking:<br>
I saw a grizzled vixen slinking<br>
Behind a clucking brood of grouse<br>
That rose and cackled at my coming:<br>
And all about my way were flying<br>
The peewit, with their slow wings creaking;<br>
And little jack-snipe darted, drumming:<br>
And now and then a golden plover<br>
Or redshank piped with reedy whistle.<br>
But never shaken bent or thistle<br>
Betrayed the quarry I was seeking;<br>
And not an instant, anywhere<br>
Did I clap eyes upon a hare.<br><br>

So, travelling still, the twilight caught me;<br>
And as I stumbled on, I muttered:<br>
'A deal of luck the hare has brought me!<br>
The wind and I must spend together<br>
A hungry night among the heather.<br>
If I'd her here ...' And as I uttered,<br>
I tripped, and heard a frightened squeal;<br>
And dropped my hands in time to feel<br>
The hare just bolting 'twixt my feet.<br>
She slipped my clutch: and I stood there<br>
And cursed that devil-littered hare,<br>
That left me stranded in the dark<br>
In that wide waste of quaggy peat<br>
Beneath black night without a spark:<br>
When, looking up, I saw a flare<br>
Upon a far-off hill, and said:<br>
'By God, the heather is afire!<br>
It's mischief at this time of year ...'<br>
And then, as one bright flame shot higher,<br>
And booths and vans stood out quite clear,<br>
My wits came back into my head;<br>
And I remembered Brough Hill Fair.<br>
And as I stumbled towards the glare<br>
I knew the sudden kindling meant<br>
The Fair was over for the day;<br>
And all the cattle-folk away;<br>
And gipsy folk and tinkers now<br>
Were lighting supper-fires without<br>
Each caravan and booth and tent.<br>
And as I climbed the stiff hill-brow<br>
I quite forgot my lucky hare.<br>
I'd something else to think about:<br>
For well I knew there's broken meat<br>
For empty bellies after fair-time;<br>
And looked to have a royal rare time<br>
With something rich and prime to eat;<br>
And then to lie and toast my feet<br>
All night beside the biggest fire.<br>
But, even as I neared the first,<br>
A pleasant whiff of stewing burst<br>
From out a smoking pot a-bubble:<br>
And as I stopped behind the folk<br>
Who sprawled around, and watched it seething,<br>
A woman heard my eager breathing,<br>
And, turning, caught my hungry eye:<br>
And called out to me: 'Draw in nigher,<br>
Unless you find it too much trouble;<br>
Or you've a nose for better fare,<br>
And go to supper with the Squire ...<br>
You've got the hungry parson's air!'<br>
And all looked up, and took the joke,<br>
As I dropped gladly to the ground<br>
Among them, where they all lay gazing<br>
Upon the bubbling and the blazing.<br>
My eyes were dazzled by the fire<br>
At first; and then I glanced around;<br>
And in those swarthy, fire-lit faces &mdash; <br>
Though drowsing in the glare and heat<br>
And snuffing the warm savour in,<br>
Dead-certain of their fill of meat &mdash; <br>
I felt the bit between the teeth,<br>
The flying heels, the broken traces,<br>
And heard the highroad ring beneath<br>
The trampling hoofs; and knew them kin.<br>
Then for the first time, standing there<br>
Behind the woman who had hailed me,<br>
I saw a girl with eyes astare<br>
That looked in terror o'er my head;<br>
And, all at once, my courage failed me ...<br>
For now again, and sore-adread,<br>
My hands were hot upon a hare,<br>
That struggled, strangling in the snare ...<br>
Then once more as the girl stood clear,<br>
Before me &mdash; quaking cold with fear &mdash; <br>
I saw the hare look from her eyes ...<br><br>

And when, at last, I turned to see<br>
What held her scared, I saw a man &mdash; <br>
A fat man with dull eyes aleer &mdash; <br>
Within the shadow of the van;<br>
And I was on the point to rise<br>
To send him spinning 'mid the wheels<br>
And stop his leering grin with mud ...<br>
And would have done it in a tick ...<br>
When, suddenly, alive with fright,<br>
She started, with red, parted lips,<br>
As though she guessed we'd come to grips,<br>
And turned her black eyes full on me ...<br>
And as I looked into their light<br>
My heart forgot the lust of fight,<br>
And something shot me to the quick,<br>
And ran like wildfire through my blood,<br>
And tingled to my finger-tips ...<br>
And, in a dazzling flash, I knew<br>
I'd never been alive before ...<br>
And she was mine for evermore.<br><br>

While all the others slept asnore<br>
In caravan and tent that night,<br>
I lay alone beside the fire;<br>
And stared into its blazing core,<br>
With eyes that would not shut or tire,<br>
Because the best of all was true,<br>
And they looked still into the light<br>
Of her eyes, burning ever bright.<br>
Within the brightest coal for me ...<br>
Once more, I saw her, as she started,<br>
And glanced at me with red lips parted:<br>
And as she looked, the frightened hare<br>
Had fled her eyes; and merrily,<br>
She smiled, with fine teeth flashing white,<br>
As though she, too, were happy-hearted ...<br>
Then she had trembled suddenly,<br>
And dropped her eyes, as that fat man<br>
Stepped from the shadow of the van,<br>
And joined the circle, as the pot<br>
Was lifted off, and, piping-hot,<br>
The supper steamed in wooden bowls.<br>
Yet, she had hardly touched a bite;<br>
And never raised her eyes all night<br>
To mine again; but on the coals,<br>
As I sat staring, she had stared &mdash; <br>
The black curls, shining round her head<br>
From under the red kerchief, tied<br>
So nattily beneath her chin &mdash; <br>
And she had stolen off to bed<br>
Quite early, looking dazed and scared.<br>
Then, all agape and sleepy-eyed,<br>
Ere long the others had turned in:<br>
And I was rid of that fat man,<br>
Who slouched away to his own van.<br><br>

And now, before her van, I lay,<br>
With sleepless eyes, awaiting day;<br>
And as I gazed upon the glare<br>
I heard, behind, a gentle stir:<br>
And, turning round, I looked on her<br>
Where she stood on the little stair<br>
Outside the van, with listening air &mdash; <br>
And, in her eyes, the hunted hare ...<br>
And then, I saw her slip away,<br>
A bundle underneath her arm,<br>
Without a single glance at me.<br>
I lay a moment wondering,<br>
My heart a-thump like anything,<br>
Then, fearing she should come to harm,<br>
I rose, and followed speedily<br>
Where she had vanished in the night.<br>
And as she heard my step behind<br>
She started, and stopt dead with fright;<br>
Then blundered on as if struck blind:<br>
And now as I caught up with her,<br>
Just as she took the moorland track,<br>
I saw the hare's eyes, big and black ...<br>
She made as though she'd double back ...<br>
But when she looked into my eyes,<br>
She stood quite still and did not stir ...<br>
And picking up her fallen pack<br>
I tucked it 'neath my arm; and she<br>
Just took her luck quite quietly,<br>
As she must take what chance might come,<br>
And would not have it otherwise,<br>
And walked into the night with me,<br>
Without a word across the fells.<br><br>

And all about us, through the night,<br>
The mists were stealing, cold and white,<br>
Down every rushy syke or slack:<br>
But, soon the moon swung into sight;<br>
And as we went my heart was light.<br>
And singing like a burn in flood:<br>
And in my ears were tinkling bells;<br>
My body was a rattled drum:<br>
And fifes were shrilling through my blood<br>
That summer night, to think that she<br>
Was walking through the world with me.<br><br>

But when the air with dawn was chill.<br>
As we were travelling down a hill,<br>
She broke her silence with low-sobbing;<br>
And told her tale, her bosom throbbing<br>
As though her very heart were shaken<br>
With fear she'd yet be overtaken ...<br>
She'd always lived in caravans &mdash; <br>
Her father's, gay as any man's,<br>
Grass-green, picked out with red and yellow<br>
And glittering brave with burnished brass<br>
That sparkled in the sun like flame,<br>
And window curtains, white as snow ...<br>
But, they had died, ten years ago,<br>
Her parents both, when fever came ...<br>
And they were buried, side by side.<br>
Somewhere beneath the wayside grass ...<br>
In times of sickness, they kept wide<br>
Of towns and busybodies, so<br>
No parson's or policeman's tricks<br>
Should bother them when in a fix ...<br>
Her father never could abide<br>
A black coat or a blue, poor man ...<br>
And so, Long Dick, a kindly fellow,<br>
When you could keep him from the can,<br>
And Meg, his easy-going wife,<br>
Had taken her into their van;<br>
And kept her since her parents died ...<br>
And she had lived a happy life,<br>
Until Fat Pete's young wife was taken ...<br>
But, ever since, he'd pestered her ...<br>
And she dared scarcely breathe or stir,<br>
Lest she should see his eyes aleer ...<br>
And many a night she'd lain and shaken,<br>
And very nearly died of fear &mdash; <br>
Though safe enough within the van<br>
With Mother Meg and her good-man &mdash; <br>
For, since Fat Pete was Long Dick's friend,<br>
And they were thick and sweet as honey,<br>
And Dick owed Pete a pot of money,<br>
She knew too well how it must end ...<br>
And she would rather lie stone dead<br>
Beneath the wayside grass than wed<br>
With leering Pete, and live the life,<br>
And die the death, of his first wife ...<br>
And so, last night, clean-daft with dread,<br>
She'd bundled up a pack and fled ...<br><br>

When all the sobbing tale was out,<br>
She dried her eyes, and looked about,<br>
As though she'd left all fear behind,<br>
And out of sight were out of mind,<br>
Then, when the dawn was burning red,<br>
'I'm hungry as a hawk!' she said:<br>
And from the bundle took out bread,<br>
And at the happy end of night<br>
We sat together by a burn:<br>
And ate a thick slice, turn by turn;<br>
And laughed and kissed between each bite.<br><br>

Then, up again, and on our way<br>
We went; and tramped the livelong day<br>
The moorland trackways, steep and rough,<br>
Though there was little fear enough<br>
That they would follow on our flight.<br><br>

And then again a shiny night<br>
Among the honey-scented heather,<br>
We wandered in the moonblaze bright,<br>
Together through a land of light,<br>
A lad and lass alone with life.<br>
And merrily we laughed together,<br>
When, starting up from sleep, we heard<br>
The cock-grouse talking to his wife ...<br>
And 'Old Fat Pete' she called the bird.<br><br>

Six months and more have cantered by:<br>
And, Winter past, we're out again &mdash; <br>
We've left the fat and weatherwise<br>
To keep their coops and reeking sties.<br>
And eat their fill of oven-pies,<br>
While we win free and out again<br>
To take potluck beneath the sky<br>
With sun and moon and wind and rain.<br>
Six happy months ... and yet, at night,<br>
I've often wakened in affright,<br>
And looked upon her lying there,<br>
Beside me sleeping quietly,<br>
Adread that when she waked, I'd see<br>
The hunted hare within her eyes.<br><br>

And only last night, as I slept<br>
Beneath the shelter of a stack ...<br>
My hands were hot upon a hare,<br>
Half-strangled, struggling in the snare,<br>
When, suddenly, her eyes shot back,<br>
Big, fearful, staggering and black;<br>
And ere I knew, my grip was slack,<br>
And I was clutching empty air ...<br>
Bolt-upright from my sleep I leapt ...<br>
Her place was empty in the straw ...<br>
And then, with quaking heart, I saw<br>
That she was standing in the night,<br>
A leveret cuddled to her breast ...<br>
I spoke no word; but as the light<br>
Through banks of Eastern cloud was breaking,<br>
She turned, and saw that I was waking:<br>
And told me how she could not rest;<br>
And, rising in the night, she'd found<br>
This baby-hare crouched on the ground;<br>
And she had nursed it quite a while;<br>
But, now, she'd better let it go ...<br>
Its mother would be fretting so ...<br>
A mother's heart ...<br><br>

                      I saw her smile,<br>
And look at me with tender eyes;<br>
And as I looked into their light,<br>
My foolish, fearful heart grew wise ...<br>
And now, I knew that never there<br>
I'd see again the startled hare,<br>
Or need to dread the dreams of night.</blockquote><br>

<a name="geranm"></a><h3>Geraniums</h3>

<blockquote>Stuck in a bottle on the window-sill,<br>
In the cold gaslight burning gaily red<br>
Against the luminous blue of London night,<br>
These flowers are mine: while somewhere out of sight<br>
In some black-throated alley's stench and heat,<br>
Oblivious of the racket of the street,<br>
A poor old weary woman lies in bed.<br><br>

Broken with lust and drink, blear-eyed and ill,<br>
Her battered bonnet nodding on her head,<br>
From a dark arch she clutched my sleeve and said:<br>
'I've sold no bunch to-day, nor touched a bite ...<br>
Son, buy six-pennorth; and 't will mean a bed.'<br><br>

So blazing gaily red<br>
Against the luminous deeps<br>
Of starless London night,<br>
They burn for my delight:<br>
While somewhere, snug in bed,<br>
A worn old woman sleeps.<br><br>

And yet to-morrow will these blooms be dead<br>
With all their lively beauty; and to-morrow<br>
May end the light lusts and the heavy sorrow<br>
Of that old body with the nodding head.<br>
The last oath muttered, the last pint drained deep,<br>
She'll sink, as Cleopatra sank, to sleep;<br>
Nor need to barter blossoms for a bed.</blockquote><br>

<a name="devedge"></a><h3>Devil's Edge</h3>

<blockquote>All night I lay on Devil's Edge,<br>
Along an overhanging ledge<br>
Between the sky and sea:<br>
And as I rested 'waiting sleep,<br>
The windless sky and soundless deep<br>
In one dim, blue infinity<br>
Of starry peace encompassed me.<br><br>

And I remembered, drowsily,<br>
How 'mid the hills last night I'd lain<br>
Beside a singing moorland burn;<br>
And waked at dawn, to feel the rain<br>
Fall on my face, as on the fern<br>
That drooped about my heather-bed;<br>
And how by noon the wind had blown<br>
The last grey shred from out the sky,<br>
And blew my homespun jacket dry,<br>
As I stood on the topmost stone<br>
That crowns the cairn on Hawkshaw Head,<br>
And caught a gleam of far-off sea;<br>
And heard the wind sing in the bent<br>
Like those far waters calling me:<br>
When, my heart answering to the call,<br>
I followed down the seaward stream,<br>
By silent pool and singing fall;<br>
Till with a quiet, keen content,<br>
I watched the sun, a crimson ball,<br>
Shoot through grey seas a fiery gleam,<br>
Then sink in opal deeps from sight.<br><br>

And with the coming on of night,<br>
The wind had dropped: and as I lay,<br>
Retracing all the happy day,<br>
And gazing long and dreamily<br>
Across the dim, unsounding sea,<br>
Over the far horizon came<br>
A sudden sail of amber flame;<br>
And soon the new moon rode on high<br>
Through cloudless deeps of crystal sky.<br><br>

Too holy seemed the night for sleep;<br>
And yet, I must have slept, it seems;<br>
For, suddenly, I woke to hear<br>
A strange voice singing, shrill and clear,<br>
Down in a gully black and deep<br>
That cleft the beetling crag in twain.<br>
It seemed the very voice of dreams<br>
That drive hag-ridden souls in fear<br>
Through echoing, unearthly vales,<br>
To plunge in black, slow-crawling streams,<br>
Seeking to drown that cry, in vain ...<br>
Or some sea creature's voice that wails<br>
Through blind, white banks of fog unlifting<br>
To God-forgotten sailors drifting<br>
Rudderless to death ...<br>
And as I heard,<br>
Though no wind stirred,<br>
An icy breath<br>
Was in my hair ...<br>
And clutched my heart with cold despair ...<br>
But, as the wild song died away,<br>
There came a faltering break<br>
That shivered to a sobbing fall;<br>
And seemed half-human, after all ...<br><br>

And yet, what foot could find a track<br>
In that deep gully, sheer and black ...<br>
And singing wildly in the night!<br>
So, wondering I lay awake,         <br>
Until the coming of the light        <br>
Brought day's familiar presence back.     <br>
Down by the harbour-mouth that day.<br>
A fisher told the tale to me.<br>
Three months before, while out at sea,<br>
Young Philip Burn was lost, though how,<br>
None knew, and none would ever know.<br>
The boat becalmed at noonday lay ...<br>
And not a ripple on the sea ...<br>
And Philip standing in the bow,<br>
When his six comrades went below<br>
To sleep away an hour or so,<br>
Dog-tired with working day and night,<br>
While he kept watch ... and not a sound<br>
They heard, until, at set of sun<br>
They woke; and coming up they found<br>
The deck was empty, Philip gone ...<br>
Yet not another boat in sight ...<br>
And not a ripple on the sea.<br>
How he had vanished, none could tell.<br>
They only knew the lad was dead<br>
They'd left but now, alive and well ...<br>
And he, poor fellow, newly-wed ...<br>
And when they broke the news to her,<br>
She spoke no word to anyone:<br>
But sat all day, and would not stir &mdash; <br>
Just staring, staring in the fire,<br>
With eyes that never seemed to tire;<br>
Until, at last, the day was done,<br>
And darkness came; when she would rise,<br>
And seek the door with queer, wild eyes;<br>
And wander singing all the night<br>
Unearthly songs beside the sea:<br>
But always the first blink of light<br>
Would find her back at her own door.<br><br>

'Twas Winter when I came once more<br>
To that old village by the shore;<br>
And as, at night, I climbed the street,<br>
I heard a singing, low and sweet,<br>
Within a cottage near at hand:<br>
And I was glad awhile to stand<br>
And listen by the glowing pane:<br>
And as I hearkened, that sweet strain<br>
Brought back the night when I had lain<br>
Awake on Devil's Edge ...<br>
And now I knew the voice again,<br>
So different, free of pain and fear &mdash; <br>
Its terror turned to tenderness &mdash; <br>
And yet the same voice none the less,<br>
Though singing now so true and clear:<br>
And drawing nigh the window-ledge,<br>
I watched the mother sing to rest<br>
The baby snuggling to her breast.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="snapdrag">D. H. Lawrence</a></h2>
<br>
<h3>Snap-dragon</h3>

<blockquote>She bade me follow to her garden where     <br>
The mellow sunlight stood as in a cup<br>
Between the old grey walls; I did not dare<br>
To raise my face, I did not dare look up<br>
Lest her bright eyes like sparrows should fly in<br>
My windows of discovery and shrill 'Sin!'<br><br>

So with a downcast mien and laughing voice<br>
I followed, followed the swing of her white dress<br>
That rocked in a lilt along: I watched the poise<br>
Of her feet as they flew for a space, then paused to press<br>
The grass deep down with the royal burden of her:<br>
And gladly I'd offered my breast to the tread of her.<br><br>

'I like to see,' she said, and she crouched her down,<br>
She sunk into my sight like a settling bird;<br>
And her bosom couched in the confines of her gown<br>
Like heavy birds at rest there, softly stirred<br>
By her measured breaths: 'I like to see,' said she,<br>
'The snap-dragon put out his tongue at me.'<br><br>

She laughed, she reached her hand out to the flower<br>
Closing its crimson throat: my own throat in her power<br>
Strangled, my heart swelled up so full<br>
As if it would burst its wineskin in my throat,<br>
Choke me in my own crimson; I watched her pull<br>
The gorge of the gaping flower, till the blood did float<br><br>

    Over my eyes and I was blind &mdash; <br>
Her large brown hand stretched over<br>
The windows of my mind,<br>
And in the dark I did discover<br>
Things I was out to find:<br>
My grail, a brown bowl twined<br>
With swollen veins that met in the wrist,<br>
Under whose brown the amethyst<br>
I longed to taste: and I longed to turn<br>
My heart's red measure in her cup,<br>
I longed to feel my hot blood burn<br>
With the lambent amethyst in her cup.<br><br>

Then suddenly she looked up<br>
And I was blind in a tawny-gold day<br>
Till she took her eyes away.<br><br>

    So she came down from above<br>
    And emptied my heart of love ...<br>
    So I held my heart aloft<br>
    To the cuckoo that fluttered above,<br>
    And she settled soft.<br><br>

    It seemed that I and the morning world<br>
    Were pressed cup-shape to take this reiver<br>
    Bird who was weary to have furled<br>
    Her wings on us,<br>
    As we were weary to receive her:<br><br>

        This bird, this rich<br>
        Sumptuous central grain,<br>
        This mutable witch,<br>
        This one refrain.<br>
        This laugh in the fight,<br>
        This clot of light,<br>
        This core of night.<br><br>

    She spoke, and I closed my eyes<br>
    To shut hallucinations out.<br>
    I echoed with surprise<br>
    Hearing my mere lips shout<br>
    The answer they did devise.<br><br>

        Again, I saw a brown bird hover<br>
        Over the flowers at my feet;<br>
        I felt a brown bird hover<br>
        Over my heart, and sweet<br>
        Its shadow lay on my heart.<br>
        I thought I saw on the clover<br>
        A brown bee pulling apart<br>
        The closed flesh of the clover<br>
        And burrowing in its heart.<br><br>

    She moved her hand, and again<br>
    I felt the brown bird hover<br>
    Over my heart ... and then<br>
    The bird came down on my heart,<br>
    As on a nest the rover<br>
    Cuckoo comes, and shoves over<br>
    The brim each careful part<br>
    Of love, takes possession and settles her down,<br>
    With her wings and her feathers does drown<br>
    The nest in a heat of love.<br><br>

She turned her flushed face to me for the glint<br>
Of a moment. 'See,' she laughed, 'if you also<br>
Can make them yawn.' I put my hand to the dint<br>
In the flower's throat, and the flower gaped wide with woe.<br>
She watched, she went of a sudden intensely still,<br>
She watched my hand, and I let her watch her fill.<br><br>

I pressed the wretched, throttled flower between<br>
My fingers, till its head lay back, its fangs<br>
Poised at her: like a weapon my hand stood white and keen,<br>
And I held the choked flower-serpent in its pangs<br>
Of mordant anguish till she ceased to laugh,<br>
Until her pride's flag, smitten, cleaved down to the staff.<br><br>

She hid her face, she murmured between her lips<br>
The low word 'Don't!' I let the flower fall,<br>
But held my hand afloat still towards the slips<br>
Of blossom she fingered, and my crisp fingers all<br>
Put forth to her: she did not move, nor I,<br>
For my hand like a snake watched hers that could not fly.<br>
Then I laughed in the dark of my heart, I did exult<br>
Like a sudden chuckling of music: I bade her eyes<br>
Meet mine, I opened her helpless eyes to consult<br>
Their fear, their shame, their joy that underlies<br>
Defeat in such a battle: in the dark of her eyes<br>
My heart was fierce to make her laughter rise ...<br>
Till her dark deeps shook with convulsive thrills, and the dark<br>
Of her spirit wavered like water thrilled with light,<br>
And my heart leaped up in longing to plunge its stark<br>
Fervour within the pool of her twilight:<br>
Within her spacious gloom, in the mystery<br>
Of her barbarous soul, to grope with ecstasy ...<br><br>

And I do not care though the large hands of revenge<br>
Shall get my throat at last &mdash; shall get it soon,<br>
If the joy that they are lifted to avenge<br>
Have risen red on my night as a harvest moon,<br>
Which even Death can only put out for me,<br>
And death I know is better than not-to-be.</blockquote>

<br>
<h3>Biography</h3>

<blockquote>When I am buried, all my thoughts and acts<br>
Will be reduced to lists of dates and facts,<br>
And long before this wandering flesh is rotten<br>
The dates which made me will be all forgotten;<br>
And none will know the gleam there used to be<br>
About the feast days freshly kept by me,<br>
But men will call the golden hour of bliss<br>
'About this time,' or 'shortly after this.'<br><br>

Men do not heed the rungs by which men climb<br>
Those glittering steps, those milestones upon time,<br>
Those tombstones of dead selves, those hours of birth,<br>
Those moments of the soul in years of earth.<br>
They mark the height achieved, the main result,<br>
The power of freedom in the perished cult,<br>
The power of boredom in the dead man's deeds<br>
Not the bright moments of the sprinkled seeds.<br><br>

By many waters and on many ways<br>
I have known golden instants and bright days;<br>
The day on which, beneath an arching sail,<br>
I saw the Cordilleras and gave hail;<br>
The summer day on which in heart's delight<br>
I saw the Swansea Mumbles bursting white,<br>
The glittering day when all the waves wore flags<br>
And the ship Wanderer came with sails in rags;<br>
That curlew-calling time in Irish dusk<br>
When life became more splendid than its husk,<br>
When the rent chapel on the brae at Slains<br>
Shone with a doorway opening beyond brains;<br>
The dawn when, with a brace-block's creaking cry,<br>
Out of the mist a little barque slipped by,<br>
Spilling the mist with changing gleams of red,<br>
Then gone, with one raised hand and one turned head;<br>
The howling evening when the spindrift's mists<br>
Broke to display the four Evangelists,<br>
Snow-capped, divinely granite, lashed by breakers,<br>
Wind-beaten bones of long-since-buried acres;<br>
The night alone near water when I heard<br>
All the sea's spirit spoken by a bird;<br>
The English dusk when I beheld once more<br>
(With eyes so changed) the ship, the citied shore,<br>
The lines of masts, the streets so cheerly trod<br>
In happier seasons, and gave thanks to God.<br>
All had their beauty, their bright moments' gift,<br>
Their something caught from Time, the ever-swift.<br><br>

All of those gleams were golden; but life's hands<br>
Have given more constant gifts in changing lands;<br>
And when I count those gifts, I think them such<br>
As no man's bounty could have bettered much:<br>
The gift of country life, near hills and woods<br>
Where happy waters sing in solitudes,<br>
The gift of being near ships, of seeing each day<br>
A city of ships with great ships under weigh,<br>
The great street paved with water, filled with shipping,<br>
And all the world's flags flying and seagulls dipping.<br><br>

Yet when I am dust my penman may not know<br>
Those water-trampling ships which made me glow,<br>
But think my wonder mad and fail to find,<br>
Their glory, even dimly, from my mind,<br>
And yet they made me:<br><br>

                       not alone the ships<br>
But men hard-palmed from tallying-on to whips,<br>
The two close friends of nearly twenty years<br>
Sea-followers both, sea-wrestlers and sea-peers,<br>
Whose feet with mine wore many a bolthead bright<br>
Treading the decks beneath the riding light.<br>
Yet death will make that warmth of friendship cold,<br>
And who'll know what one said and what one told,<br>
Our hearts' communion, and the broken spells<br>
When the loud call blew at the strike of bells?<br>
No one, I know, yet let me be believed &mdash; <br>
A soul entirely known is life achieved.<br><br>

Years blank with hardship never speak a word<br>
Live in the soul to make the being stirred;<br>
Towns can be prisons where the spirit dulls<br>
Away from mates and ocean-wandering hulls,<br>
Away from all bright water and great hills<br>
And sheep-walks where the curlews cry their fills;<br>
Away in towns, where eyes have nought to see<br>
But dead museums and miles of misery<br>
And floating life un-rooted from man's need<br>
And miles of fish-hooks baited to catch greed<br>
And life made wretched out of human ken<br>
And miles of shopping women served by men.<br>
So, if the penman sums my London days,<br>
Let him but say that there were holy ways,<br>
Dull Bloomsbury streets of dull brick mansions old<br>
With stinking doors where women stood to scold<br>
And drunken waits at Christmas with their horn<br>
Droning the news, in snow, that Christ was born;<br>
And windy gas lamps and the wet roads shining<br>
And that old carol of the midnight whining,<br>
And that old room above the noisy slum<br>
Where there was wine and fire and talk with some<br>
Under strange pictures of the wakened soul<br>
To whom this earth was but a burnt-out coal.<br><br>

O Time, bring back those midnights and those friends,<br>
Those glittering moments that a spirit lends,<br>
That all may be imagined from the flash,<br>
The cloud-hid god-game through the lightning gash;<br>
Those hours of stricken sparks from which men took<br>
Light to send out to men in song or book;<br>
Those friends who heard St. Pancras' bells strike two,<br>
Yet stayed until the barber's cockerel crew,<br>
Talking of noble styles, the Frenchman's best,<br>
The thought beyond great poets not expressed,<br>
The glory of mood where human frailty failed,<br>
The forts of human light not yet assailed,<br>
Till the dim room had mind and seemed to brood,<br>
Binding our wills to mental brotherhood;<br>
Till we became a college, and each night<br>
Was discipline and manhood and delight;<br>
Till our farewells and winding down the stairs<br>
At each gray dawn had meaning that Time spares<br>
That we, so linked, should roam the whole world round<br>
Teaching the ways our brooding minds had found,<br>
Making that room our Chapter, our one mind<br>
Where all that this world soiled should be refined.<br><br>

Often at night I tread those streets again<br>
And see the alleys glimmering in the rain,<br>
Yet now I miss that sign of earlier tramps,<br>
A house with shadows of plane-boughs under lamps,<br>
The secret house where once a beggar stood,<br>
Trembling and blind, to show his woe for food.<br>
And now I miss that friend who used to walk<br>
Home to my lodgings with me, deep in talk,<br>
Wearing the last of night out in still streets<br>
Trodden by us and policemen on their beats<br>
And cats, but else deserted; now I miss<br>
That lively mind and guttural laugh of his<br>
And that strange way he had of making gleam,<br>
Like something real, the art we used to dream.<br>
London has been my prison; but my books<br>
Hills and great waters, labouring men and brooks,<br>
Ships and deep friendships and remembered days<br>
Which even now set all my mind ablaze &mdash; <br>
As that June day when, in the red bricks' chinks<br>
I saw the old Roman ruins white with pinks<br>
And felt the hillside haunted even then<br>
By not dead memory of the Roman men;<br>
And felt the hillside thronged by souls unseen<br>
Who knew the interest in me, and were keen<br>
That man alive should understand man dead<br>
So many centuries since the blood was shed,<br>
And quickened with strange hush because this comer<br>
Sensed a strange soul alive behind the summer.<br>
That other day on Ercall when the stones<br>
Were sunbleached white, like long unburied bones,<br>
While the bees droned and all the air was sweet<br>
From honey buried underneath my feet,<br>
Honey of purple heather and white clover<br>
Sealed in its gummy bags till summer's over.<br>
Then other days by water, by bright sea,<br>
Clear as clean glass, and my bright friend with me;<br>
The cove clean bottomed where we saw the brown<br>
Red spotted plaice go skimming six feet down,<br>
And saw the long fronds waving, white with shells,<br>
Waving, unfolding, drooping, to the swells;<br>
That sadder day when we beheld the great<br>
And terrible beauty of a Lammas spate<br>
Roaring white-mouthed in all the great cliff's gaps,<br>
Headlong, tree-tumbling fury of collapse,<br>
While drenching clouds drove by and every sense<br>
Was water roaring or rushing or in offence,<br>
And mountain sheep stood huddled and blown gaps gleamed<br>
Where torn white hair of torrents shook and streamed.<br>
That sadder day when we beheld again<br>
A spate going down in sunshine after rain<br>
When the blue reach of water leaping bright<br>
Was one long ripple and clatter, flecked with white.<br>
And that far day, that never blotted page<br>
When youth was bright like flowers about old age,<br>
Fair generations bringing thanks for life<br>
To that old kindly man and trembling wife<br>
After their sixty years: Time never made<br>
A better beauty since the Earth was laid,<br>
Than that thanksgiving given to grey hair<br>
For the great gift of life which brought them there.<br><br>

Days of endeavour have been good: the days<br>
Racing in cutters for the comrade's praise.<br>
The day they led my cutter at the turn,<br>
Yet could not keep the lead, and dropped astern;<br>
The moment in the spurt when both boats' oars<br>
Dipped in each other's wash, and throats grew hoarse,<br>
And teeth ground into teeth, and both strokes quickened<br>
Lashing the sea, and gasps came, and hearts sickened,<br>
And coxswains damned us, dancing, banking stroke,<br>
To put our weights on, though our hearts were broke,<br>
And both boats seemed to stick and sea seemed glue,<br>
The tide a mill race we were struggling through;<br>
And every quick recover gave us squints<br>
Of them still there, and oar-tossed water-glints,<br>
And cheering came, our friends, our foemen cheering,<br>
A long, wild, rallying murmur on the hearing,<br>
'Port Fore!' and 'Starboard Fore!' 'Port Fore' 'Port Fore,'<br>
'Up with her,' 'Starboard'; and at that each oar<br>
Lightened, though arms were bursting, and eyes shut,<br>
And the oak stretchers grunted in the strut,<br>
And the curse quickened from the cox, our bows<br>
Crashed, and drove talking water, we made vows,<br>
Chastity vows and temperance; in our pain<br>
We numbered things we'd never eat again<br>
If we could only win; then came the yell<br>
'Starboard,' 'Port Fore,' and then a beaten bell<br>
Rung as for fire to cheer us. 'Now.' Oars bent,<br>
Soul took the looms now body's bolt was spent,<br>
'Damn it, come on now.' 'On now,' 'On now,' 'Starboard.'<br>
'Port Fore,' 'Up with her, Port'; each cutter harboured<br>
Ten eye-shut painsick strugglers, 'Heave, oh heave,'<br>
Catcalls waked echoes like a shrieking sheave.<br>
'Heave,' and I saw a back, then two. 'Port Fore,'<br>
'Starboard,' 'Come on'; I saw the midship oar,<br>
And knew we had done them. 'Port Fore,' 'Starboard,' 'Now.'<br>
I saw bright water spurting at their bow,<br>
Their cox' full face an instant. They were done.<br>
The watchers' cheering almost drowned the gun.<br>
We had hardly strength to toss our oars; our cry<br>
Cheering the losing cutter was a sigh.<br><br>

Other bright days of action have seemed great:<br>
Wild days in a pampero off the Plate;<br>
Good swimming days, at Hog Back or the Coves<br>
Which the young gannet and the corbie loves;<br>
Surf-swimming between rollers, catching breath<br>
Between the advancing grave and breaking death,<br>
Then shooting up into the sunbright smooth<br>
To watch the advancing roller bare her tooth;<br>
And days of labour also, loading, hauling;<br>
Long days at winch or capstan, heaving, pawling;<br>
The days with oxen, dragging stone from blasting,<br>
And dusty days in mills, and hot days masting.<br>
Trucking on dust-dry deckings smooth like ice,<br>
And hunts in mighty wool-racks after mice;<br>
Mornings with buckwheat when the fields did blanch<br>
With White Leghorns come from the chicken ranch;<br>
Days near the spring upon the sunburnt hill,<br>
Plying the maul or gripping tight the drill;<br>
Delights of work most real, delights that change<br>
The headache life of towns to rapture strange<br>
Not known by townsmen, nor imagined; health<br>
That puts new glory upon mental wealth<br>
And makes the poor man rich.<br><br>

                             But that ends, too.<br>
Health, with its thoughts of life; and that bright view,<br>
That sunny landscape from life's peak, that glory,<br>
And all a glad man's comments on life's story,<br>
And thoughts of marvellous towns and living men,<br>
And what pens tell, and all beyond the pen,<br>
End, and are summed in words so truly dead<br>
They raise no image of the heart and head,<br>
The life, the man alive, the friend we knew,<br>
The minds ours argued with or listened to,<br>
None; but are dead, and all life's keenness, all,<br>
Is dead as print before the funeral;<br>
Even deader after, when the dates are sought,<br>
And cold minds disagree with what we thought.<br><br>

This many-pictured world of many passions<br>
Wears out the nations as a woman fashions,<br>
And what life is is much to very few;<br>
Men being so strange, so mad, and what men do<br>
So good to watch or share; but when men count<br>
Those hours of life that were a bursting fount<br>
Sparkling the dusty heart with living springs,<br>
There seems a world, beyond our earthly things,<br>
Gated by golden moments, each bright time<br>
Opening to show the city white like lime, <br>
High-towered and many-peopled. This made sure, <br>
Work that obscures those moments seems impure,<br>
Making our not-returning time of breath<br>
Dull with the ritual and records of death,<br>
That frost of fact by which our wisdom gives<br>
Correctly stated death to all that lives.<br><br>

Best trust the happy moments. What they gave<br>
Makes man less fearful of the certain grave,<br>
And gives his work compassion and new eyes.<br>
The days that make us happy make us wise.</blockquote>

<h3>Child of Dawn</h3>

<blockquote>O gentle vision in the dawn:<br>
My spirit over faint cool water glides.<br>
Child of the day,<br>
To thee;<br>
And thou art drawn<br>
By kindred impulse over silver tides<br>
The dreamy way<br>
To me.<br><br>

I need thy hands, O gentle wonder-child,<br>
For they are moulded unto all repose;<br>
Thy lips are frail,<br>
And thou art cooler than an April rose;<br>
White are thy words and mild:<br>
Child of the morning, hail!<br><br>

Breathe thus upon mine eyelids &mdash; that we twain<br>
May build the day together out of dreams.<br>
Life, with thy breath upon my eyelids, seems<br>
Exquisite to the utmost bounds of pain.<br>
I cannot live, except as I may be<br>
Compelled for love of thee.<br>
O let us drift,<br>
Frail as the floating silver of a star,<br>
Or like the summer humming of a bee,<br>
Or stream-reflected sunlight through a rift.<br><br>

I will not hope, because I know, alas,<br>
Morning will glide, and noon, and then the night<br>
Will take thee from me. Everything must pass<br>
Swiftly &mdash; but nought so swift as dawn-delight.<br>
If I could hold thee till the day,<br>
Is broad on sea and hill,<br>
Child of repose,<br>
What god can say,<br>
What god or mortal knows,<br>
What dream thou mightest not in me fulfil?<br><br>

O gentle vision in the dawn:<br>
My spirit over faint cool water glides,<br>
Child of the day,<br>

<a name="leman"></a><h3>Lake Leman</h3>

<blockquote>It is the sacred hour: above the far<br>
Low emerald hills that northward fold,<br>
Calmly, upon the blue the evening star<br>
Floats, wreathed in dusky gold.<br>
The winds have sung all day; but now they lie<br>
Faint, sleeping; and the evening sounds awake.<br>
The slow bell tolls across the water: I<br>
Am haunted by the spirit of the lake.<br>
It seems as though the sounding of the bell<br>
Intoned the low song of the water-soul,<br>
And at some moments I can hardly tell<br>
The long-resounding echo from the toll.<br>
O thou mysterious lake, thy spell<br>
Holds all who round thy fruitful margin dwell.<br>
Oft have I seen home-going peasants' eyes<br>
Lit with the peace that emanates from thee.<br>
Those who among thy waters plunge, arise<br>
Filled with new wisdom and serenity.<br>
Thy veins are in the mountains. I have heard,<br>
Down-stretched beside thee at the silent noon,<br>
With leaning head attentive to thy word,<br>
A secret and delicious mountain-tune,<br>
Proceeding as from many shadowed hours<br>
In ancient forests carpeted with flowers,<br>
Or far, where hidden waters, wandering<br>
Through banks of snow, trickle, and meet, and sing.<br>
Ah, what repose at noon to go,<br>
Lean on thy bosom, hold thee with wide hands,<br>
And listen for the music of the snow!<br>
But most, as now,<br>
When harvest covers thy surrounding lands,<br>
I love thee, with a coronal of sheaves<br>
Crowned regent of the day;<br>
And on the air thy placid breathing leaves<br>
A scent of corn and hay.<br>
For thou hast gathered (as a mother will<br>
The sayings of her children in her heart)<br>
The harvest-thoughts of reapers on the hill,<br>
When the cool rose and honeysuckle fill<br>
The air, and fruit is laden on the cart.<br>
Thou breathest the delight<br>
Of summer evening at the deep-roofed farm,<br>
And meditation of the summer night,<br>
When the enravished earth is lying warm<br>
From recent kisses of the conquering sun.<br><br>

Dwell as a spirit in me, O thou one<br>
Sweet natural presence. In the years to be<br>
When all the mortal loves perchance are done,<br>
Them I will bid farewell, but, oh, not thee.<br>
I love thee. When the youthful visions fade,<br>
Fade thou not also in the hopeless past.<br>
Be constant and delightful, as a maid<br>
Sought over all the world, and found at last.</blockquote>

<h3>A Sicilian Idyll</h3><br>


<i><b>First Scene</b></i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>I thank thee, no;<br>
Already have I drunk a bowl of wine ...<br>
Nay, nay, why wouldst thou rise?<br>
There rolls thy ball of worsted! Sit thee down;<br>
Come, sit thee down, Cydilla,<br>
And let me fetch thy ball, rewind the wool,<br>
And tell thee all that happened yesterday.</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Thanks, Damon; now, by Zeus, thou art so brisk,<br>
It shames me that to stoop should try my bones.</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>We both are old,<br>
And if we may have peaceful days are blessed;<br>
Few hours of buoyancy will come to break<br>
The sure withdrawal from us of life's flood.</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>True, true, youth looks a great way off! To think<br>
It once was age did lie quite out of sight!
</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>Not many days have been so beautiful<br>
As yesterday, Cydilla; yet one was;<br>
And I with thee broke tranced on its fine spell;<br>
Thou dost remember? yes? but not with tears,<br>
Ah, not with tears, Cydilla, pray, oh, pray!</blockquote><br>



<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Pardon me, Damon,<br>
'Tis many years since thou hast touched thereon;<br>
And something stirs about thee &mdash; <br>
Such air of eagerness as was thine when<br>
I was more foolish than in my life, I hope<br>
To ever have been at another time.</blockquote><br>



<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>Pooh! foolish? &mdash; thou wast then so very wise<br>
That, often having seen thee foolish since,<br>
Wonder has made me faint that thou shouldst err.</blockquote><br>



<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Nay, then I erred, dear Damon; and remorse<br>
Was not so slow to find me as thou deemst.
</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>There, mop those dear wet eyes, or thou'lt ne'er hear<br>
What it was filled my heart full yesterday.
</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Tell, Damon; since I well know that regrets<br>
Hang like dull gossips round another's ear.
</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>First, thou must know that oftentimes I rise, &mdash; <br>
Not heeding or not finding sleep, of watching<br>
Afraid no longer to be prodigal, &mdash; <br>
And gaze upon the beauty of the night.<br>
Quiet hours, while dawn absorbs the waning stars,<br>
Are like cold water sipped between our cups<br>
Washing the jaded palate till it taste<br>
The wine again. Ere the sun rose, I sat<br>
Within my garden porch; my lamp was left<br>
Burning beside my bed, though it would be<br>
Broad day before I should return upstairs.<br>
I let it burn, willing to waste some oil<br>
Rather than to disturb my tranquil mood;<br>
But, as the Fates determined, it was seen. &mdash; <br>
Suddenly, running round the dovecote, came<br>
A young man naked, breathless, through the dawn,<br>
Florid with haste and wine; it was Hipparchus.<br>
Yes, there he stood before me panting, rubbing<br>
His heated flesh which felt the cold at once.<br>
When he had breath enough he begged me straight<br>
To put the lamp out; and himself had done it<br>
Ere I was on the stair.<br>
Flung all along my bed, his gasping shook it<br>
When I at length could sit down by his side:<br>
'What cause, young sir, brings you here in this plight<br>
At such an hour?' He shuddered, sighed and rolled<br>
My blanket round him; then came a gush of words:<br>
'The first of causes, Damon, namely Love,<br>
Eldest and least resigned and most unblushing<br>
Of all the turbulent impulsive gods.<br>
A quarter of an hour scarce has flown<br>
Since lovely arms clung round me, and my head<br>
Asleep lay nested in a woman's hair;<br>
My cheek still bears print of its ample coils.'<br>
Athwart its burning flush he drew my fingers<br>
And their tips felt it might be as he said.<br>
'Oh I have had a night, a night, a night!<br>
Had Paris so much bliss?<br>
And oh! was Helen's kiss<br>
To be compared with those I tasted?<br>
Which but for me had all been wasted<br>
On a bald man, a fat man, a gross man, a beast<br>
To scare the best guest from the very best feast!'<br>
Cydilla need not hear half that he said,<br>
For he was mad awhile.<br>
But having given rein to hot caprice,<br>
And satyr jest, and the distempered male,<br>
At length, I heard his story.<br>
At sun-down certain miles without the town.<br>
He'd chanced upon a light-wheeled litter-car,<br>
And in it there stood one<br>
Yet more a woman than her garb was rich,<br>
With more of youth and health than elegance.<br>
'The mules,' he said, 'were beauties: she was one,<br>
And cried directions to the neighbour field:<br>
"O catch that big bough! Fool, not that, the next!<br>
Clumsy, you've let it go! O stop it swaying,<br>
The eggs will jolt out!" From the road,' said he,<br>
'I could not see who thus was rated; so<br>
Sprang up beside her and beheld her husband,<br>
Lover or keeper, what you like to call him; &mdash; <br>
A middle-aged stout man upon whose shoulders<br>
Kneeled up a scraggy mule-boy slave, who was<br>
The fool that could not reach a thrush's nest<br>
Which they, while plucking almond, had revealed.<br>
Before she knew who it could be, I said<br>
"Why yes, he is a fool, but we, fair friend,<br>
Were we not foolish waiting for such fools?<br>
Let us be off!" I stooped, took, shook the reins<br>
With one hand, while the other clasped her waist.<br>
"Ah, who?" she turned; I smiled like amorous Zeus;<br>
A certain vagueness clouded her wild eyes<br>
As though she saw a swan, a bull, a shower<br>
Of hurried flames, and felt divinely pleased.<br>
I cracked the whip and we were jolted down;<br>
A kiss was snatched getting the ribbons straight;<br>
We hardly heard them first begin to bawl,<br>
So great our expedition towards the town:<br>
We flew. I pulled up at an inn, then bid them<br>
Stable my mules and chariot and prepare<br>
A meal for Dives; meanwhile we would stroll<br>
Down to the market. Took her arm in mine,<br>
And, out of sight, hurried her through cross-lanes,<br>
Bade her choose, now at a fruit, now pastry booth.<br>
Until we gained my lodging she spoke little<br>
But often laughed, tittering from time to time,<br>
"O Bacchus, what a prank! &mdash; Just think of Cymon,<br>
So stout as he is, at least five miles to walk<br>
Without a carriage! &mdash; well you take things coolly" &mdash; <br>
Or such appreciation nice of gifts<br>
I need not boast of, since I had them gratis.<br>
When my stiff door creaked open grudgingly<br>
Her face first fell; the room looked bare enough.<br>
Still we brought with us food and cakes; I owned<br>
A little cellar of delicious wine;<br>
An unasked neighbour's garden furnished flowers;<br>
Jests helped me nimbly, I surpassed myself;<br>
So we were friends and, having laughed, we drank,<br>
Ate, sang, danced, grew wild. Soon both had one<br>
Desire, effort, goal,<br>
One bed, one sleep, one dream ...<br>
O Damon, Damon, both had one alarm,<br>
When woken by the door forced rudely open,<br>
Lit from the stair, bedazzled, glowered at, hated!<br>
She clung to me; her master, husband, uncle<br>
(I know not which or what he was) stood there;<br>
It crossed my mind he might have been her father.<br>
Naked, unarmed, I rose, and did assume<br>
What dignity is not derived from clothes,<br>
Bid them to quit my room, my private dwelling.<br>
It was no use, for that gross beast was rich;<br>
Had his been neither legal right nor moral,<br>
My natural right was nought, for his she was<br>
In eyes of those bribed catchpolls. Brute revenge<br>
Seethed in his pimpled face: "To gaol with him!"<br>
He shouted huskily. I wrapped some clothes<br>
About my shuddering bed-fellow, a sheet<br>
Flung round myself; ere she was led away,<br>
Had whispered to her "Shriek, faint on the stairs!"<br>
Then I was seized by two dog officers.<br>
That girl was worth her keep, for, going down,<br>
She suddenly writhed, gasped, and had a fit.<br>
My chance occurred, and I whipped through the casement;<br>
All they could do was catch away the sheet;<br>
I dropped a dozen feet into a bush,<br>
Soon found my heels and plied them; here I am.'</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>A strange tale, Damon, this to tell to me<br>
And introduce as thou at first began.</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>Thy life, Cydilla, has at all times been<br>
A ceremony: this young man's<br>
Discovered by free impulse, not couched in forms<br>
Worn and made smooth by prudent folk long dead.<br>
I love Hipparchus for his wave-like brightness;<br>
He wastes himself, but till his flash is gone<br>
I shall be ever glad to hear him laugh:<br>
Nor could one make a Spartan of him even<br>
Were one the Spartan with a will to do it.<br>
Yet had there been no more than what is told,<br>
Thou wouldst not now be lending ear to me.</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Hearing such things, I think of my poor son,<br>
Which makes me far too sad to smile at folly.</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>There, let me tell thee all just as it happened,<br>
And of thy son I shall be speaking soon.
</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Delphis! Alas, are his companions still<br>
No better than such ne'er-do-wells? I thought<br>
His life was sager now, though he has killed<br>
My hopes of seeing him a councillor.</blockquote><br>



<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>How thou art quick to lay claim to a sorrow!<br>
Should I have come so eagerly to thee<br>
If all there was to tell thee were such poor news?</blockquote><br>



<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Forgive me; well know I there is no end<br>
To Damon's kindness; my poor boy has proved it;<br>
Could but his father so have understood him!</blockquote><br>



<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>Let lie the sad contents of vanished years;<br>
Why with complaints reproach the helpless dead?<br>
Thy husband ne'er will cross thy hopes again.<br>
Come, think of what a sky made yesterday<br>
The worthy dream of thrice divine Apollo!<br>
Hipparchus' plan was, we should take the road<br>
(As, when such mornings tempt me, is my wont)<br>
And cross the hills, along the coast, toward Mylae.<br>
He in disguise, a younger handier Chloe,<br>
Would lead my mule; must brown his face and arms:<br>
And thereon straight to wake her he was gone.<br>
Their voices from her cabin crossed the yard;<br>
He swears those parts of her are still well made<br>
Which she keeps too well hidden when about; &mdash; <br>
And she, no little pleased; that interlards,<br>
Between her exclamations at his figure,<br>
Reproof of gallantries half-laughed at hers.<br>
Anon she titters as he dons her dress <br>
Doubtless with pantomime &mdash; <br>
Head-carriage and hip-swagger.<br>
A wench, more conscious of her sex than grace,<br>
He then rejoined me, changed beyond belief,<br>
Roguish as vintage makes them; bustling helps<br>
Or hinders Chloe harness to the mule; &mdash; <br>
In fine bewitching both her age and mine.<br>
The life that in such fellows runs to waste<br>
Is like a gust that pulls about spring trees<br>
And spoils your hope of fruit, while it delights<br>
The sense with bloom and odour scattered, mingled<br>
With salt spume savours from a crested offing.<br>
The sun was not long up when we set forth<br>
And, coming to the deeply shadowed gate,<br>
Found catchpolls lurked there, true to his surmise.<br>
Them he, his beard disguised like face-ache, sauced;<br>
(Too gaily for that bandaged cheek, thought I);<br>
But they, whose business was to think,<br>
Were quite contented, let the hussy pass,<br>
Returned her kisses blown back down the road,<br>
And crowned the mirth of their outwitter's heart.<br>
As the steep road wound clear above the town,<br>
Fewer became those little comedies<br>
To which encounters roused him: till, at last,<br>
He scarcely knew we passed some vine-dressers:<br>
And I could see the sun's heat, lack of sleep,<br>
And his late orgy would defeat his powers.<br>
So, where the road grows level and must soon<br>
Descend, I bade him climb into the car;<br>
On which the mule went slower still and slower.<br>
This creature who, upon occasions, shows<br>
Taste very like her master's, left the highway<br>
And took a grass-grown wheel-track that led down<br>
Zigzag athwart the broad curved banks of lawn<br>
Coating a valley between rounded hills<br>
Which faced the sea abruptly in huge crags.  <br>
Each slope grew steeper till I left my seat  <br>
And led the mule; for now Hipparchus' snore  <br>
Tuned with the crooning waves heard from below.<br>
We passed two narrow belts of wood and then<br>
The sea, that first showed blue above their tops,<br>
Was spread before us chequered with white waves<br>
Breaking beneath on boulders which choked up<br>
The narrowed issue seawards of the glen.<br>
The steep path would no more admit of wheels:<br>
I took the beast and tethered her to graze<br>
Within the shade of a stunt ilex clump, &mdash; <br>
Returned to find a vacant car; Hipparchus,<br>
Uneasy on my tilting down the shafts,<br>
And heated with strange clothes, had roused himself<br>
And lay asleep upon his late disguise,<br>
Naked 'neath the cool eaves of one huge rock<br>
That stood alone, much higher up than those<br>
Over, and through, and under which, the waves<br>
Made music or forced milk-white floods of foam.<br>
There I reclined, while vision, sound and scent<br>
Won on my willing soul like sleep on joy,<br>
Till all accustomed thoughts were far away<br>
As from a happy child the cares of men.<br>
The hour was sacred to those earlier gods<br>
Who are not active, but divinely wait<br>
The consummation of their first great deeds,<br>
Unfolding still and blessing hours serene.<br>
Presently I was gazing on a boy,<br>
(Though whence he came my mind had not perceived).<br>
Twelve or thirteen he seemed, with clinging feet<br>
Poised on a boulder, and against the sea<br>
Set off. His wide-brimmed hat of straw was arched<br>
Over his massed black and abundant curls<br>
By orange ribbon tied beneath his chin;<br>
Around his arms and shoulders his sole dress,<br>
A cloak, was all bunched up. He leapt, and lighted<br>
Upon the boulder just beneath; there swayed,<br>
Re-poised,<br>
And perked his head like an inquisitive bird,<br>
As gravely happy; of all unconscious save<br>
His body's aptness for its then employment;<br>
His eyes intent on shells in some clear pool<br>
Or choosing where he next will plant his feet.<br>
Again he leaps, his curls against his hat<br>
Bounce up behind. The daintiest thing alive,<br>
He rocks awhile, turned from me towards the sea;<br>
Unseen I might devour him with my eyes.<br>
At last he stood upon a ledge each wave<br>
Spread with a sheet of foam four inches deep;<br>
He gazing at them saw them disappear<br>
And reappear all shining and refreshed:<br>
Then raised his head, beheld the ocean stretched<br>
Alive before him in its magnitude.<br>
None but a child could have been so absorbed<br>
As to escape its spell till then, none else<br>
Could so have voiced glad wonder in a song: &mdash; <br>
All the waves of the sea are there!<br>
In at my eyes they crush.<br>
Till my head holds as fair a sea:<br>
Though I shut my eyes, they are there!<br>
Now towards my lids they rush,<br>
Mad to burst forth from me<br>
Back to the open air! &mdash; <br>
To follow them my heart needs,<br>
O white-maned steeds, to ride you;<br>
Lithe-shouldered steeds,<br>
To the western isles astride you<br>
Amyntas speeds!'<br>
'Damon!' said a voice quite close to me<br>
And looking up ... as might have stood Apollo  <br>
In one vast garment such as shepherds wear    <br>
And leaning on such tall staff stood ... Thou guessest,<br>
Whose majesty as vainly was disguised<br>
As must have been Apollo's minding sheep.</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Delphis! I know, dear Damon, it was Delphis!<br>
Healthy life in the country having chased<br>
His haggard looks; his speech is not wild now,<br>
Nor wicked with exceptions to things honest:<br>
Thy face a kindlier way than speech tells this.</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>Yea, dear Cydilla, he was altogether<br>
What mountaineers might dream of for a king.
</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>But tell me, is he tutor to that boy?</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>He is an elder brother to the lad.</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Nay, nay, hide nothing, speak the worst at once.</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>I meant no hint of ill;<br>
A god in love with young Amyntas might<br>
Look as he did; fathers alone feel like him:<br>
Could I convey his calm and happy speech<br>
Thy last suspicion would be laid to rest.</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Damon, see, my glad tears have drowned all fear;<br>
Think'st thou he may come back and win renown,<br>
And fill his father's place?<br>
Not as his father filled it,<br>
But with an inward spirit correspondent<br>
To that contained and high imposing mien<br>
Which made his father honoured before men<br>
Of greater wisdom, more integrity.</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>And loved before men of more kindliness!</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>O Damon, far too happy am I now<br>
To grace thy naughtiness by showing pain.<br>
My Delphis 'owns the brains and presence too<br>
That make a Pericles!' ... (the words are thine)<br>
Had he but the will; and has he now?<br>
Good Damon, tell me quick?</blockquote><br>



<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>He dreams not of the court, and city life<br>
Is what he rails at.</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Well, if he now be wise and sober-souled<br>
And loved for goodness, I can rest content.</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>My brain lights up to see thee happy! wait,<br>
It may be I can give some notion how<br>
Our poet spoke:<br>
'Damon, the best of life is in thine eyes &mdash; <br>
Worship of promise-laden beauty. Seems he not<br>
The god of this fair scene?<br>
Those waves claim such a master as that boy;<br>
And these green slopes have waited till his feet<br>
Should wander them, to prove they were not spread<br>
In wantonness. What were this flower's prayer<br>
Had it a voice? The place behind his ear<br>
Would brim its cup with bliss and overbrim;<br>
Oh, to be worn and fade beside his cheek!' &mdash; <br>
'In love and happy, Delphis; and the boy?' &mdash; <br>
'Loves and is happy' &mdash; <br>
                       You hale from?' &mdash; <br>
                                         'Ætna;<br>
We have been out two days and crossed this ridge,<br>
West of Mount Mycon's head. I serve his father,<br>
A farmer well-to-do and full of sense,<br>
Who owns a grass-farm cleared among the pines<br>
North-west the cone, where even at noon in summer,<br>
The slope it falls on lengthens a tree's shade.<br>
To play the lyre, read and write and dance<br>
I teach this lad; in all their country toil<br>
Join, nor ask better fare than cheese, black bread,<br>
Butter or curds, and milk, nor better bed<br>
Than litter of dried fern or lentisk yields,<br>
Such as they all sleep soundly on and dream,<br>
(If e'er they dream) of places where it grew, &mdash; <br>
Where they have gathered mushrooms, eaten berries,<br>
Or found the sheep they lost, or killed a fox,<br>
Or snared the kestrel, or so played their pipes<br>
Some maid showed pleasure, sighed, nay even wept.<br>
There to be poet need involve no strain,<br>
For though enough of coarseness, dung &mdash; nay, nay,<br>
And suffering too, be mingled with the life,<br>
'Tis wedded to such air,<br>
Such water and sound health!<br>
What else might jar or fret chimes in attuned<br>
Like satyr's cloven hoof or lorn nymph's grief<br>
In a choice ode. Though lust, disease and death,<br>
As everywhere, are cruel tyrants, yet<br>
They all wear flowers, and each sings a song<br>
Such as the hilly echo loves to learn.' <br>
'At last then even Delphis knows content?'<br>
'Damon, not so:<br>
This life has brought me health but not content.<br>
That boy, whose shouts ring round us while he flings<br>
Intent each stone toward yon shining object<br>
Afloat inshore ... I eat my heart to think<br>
How all which makes him worthy of more love<br>
Must train his ear to catch the siren croon<br>
That never else had reached his upland home!<br>
And he who failed in proof, how should he arm<br>
Another against perils? Ah, false hope<br>
And credulous enjoyment! How should I,<br>
Life's fool, while wakening ready wit in him,<br>
Teach how to shun applause and those bright eyes<br>
Of women who pour in the lap of spring<br>
Their whole year's substance? They can offer<br>
To fill the day much fuller than I could,<br>
And yet teach night surpass it. Can my means<br>
Prevent the ruin of the thing I cherish?<br>
What cares Zeus for him? Fate despises love.<br>
Why, lads more exquisite, brimming with promise,<br>
A thousand times have been lost for the lack<br>
Of just the help a watchful god might give;<br>
But which the best of fathers, best of mothers,<br>
Of friends, of lovers cannot quite supply.<br>
Powers, who swathe man's virtue up in weakness,<br>
Then plunge his delicate mind in hot desire,<br>
Preparing pleasure first and after shame<br>
To bandage round his eyes, &mdash; these gods are not  <br>
The friends of men.'            <br>
The Delphis of old days before me stood,    <br>
Passionate, stormy, teeming with black thought,<br>
His back turned on that sparkling summer sea,<br>
His back turned on his love; and wilder words<br>
And less coherent thought poured from him now.<br>
Hipparchus waking took stock of the scene.<br>
I watched him wend down, rubbing sleepy lids,<br>
To where the boy was busy throwing stones.<br>
He joined the work, but even his stronger arm<br>
And heavier flints he hurled would not suffice<br>
To drive that floating object nearer shore:<br>
And, ere the rebel Delphis had expressed<br>
Enough of anger and contempt for gods,<br>
(Who, he asserted, were the dreams of men),<br>
I saw the stone-throwers both take the water<br>
And swimming easily attain their end.<br>
The way they held their noses proved the thing<br>
A tunny, belly floating upward, dead;<br>
Both towed it till the current caught and swept it<br>
Out far from that sweet cove; they laughing watched:<br>
Then, suddenly, Amyntas screamed and Delphis<br>
Turned to see him sink<br>
Locked in Hipparchus' arms.<br>
The god Apollo never<br>
Burst through a cloud with more ease than thy son<br>
Poured from his homespun garb<br>
The rapid glory of his naked limbs,<br>
And like a streak of lightning reached the waves: &mdash; <br>
Wherein his thwarted speed appeared more awful<br>
As, brought within the scope of comprehension,<br>
Its progress and its purpose could be gauged.<br>
Spluttering Amyntas rose, Hipparchus near him<br>
Who cried 'Why coy of kisses, lovely lad?<br>
I ne'er would harm thee; art thou not ashamed<br>
To treat thy conquest thus?'<br>
He shouted partly to drown the sea's noise, chiefly<br>
The nearing Delphis to disarm.<br>
His voice lost its assurance while he spoke,<br>
And, as he finished, quick to escape he turned;<br>
Thy son's eyes and that steady coming on,<br>
As he might see them over ruffled crests,<br>
Far better helped him swim<br>
Than ever in his life he swam before.<br>
Delphis passed by Amyntas;<br>
Hipparchus was o'ertaken,<br>
Cuffed, ducked and shaken;<br>
In vain he clung about his angry foe;<br>
Held under he perforce let go:<br>
I, fearing for his life, set up a whoop<br>
To bring cause and effect to thy son's mind,<br>
And in dire rage's room his sense returned.<br>
He towed Hipparchus back like one he'd saved<br>
From drowning, laid him out upon that ledge<br>
Where late Amyntas stood, where now he kneeled<br>
Shivering, alarmed and mute.<br>
Delphis next set the drowned man's mouth to drain;<br>
We worked his arms, for I had joined them; soon<br>
His breathing recommenced; we laid him higher<br>
On sun-warmed turf to come back to himself;<br>
Then we climbed to the cart without a word.<br>
The sun had dried their limbs; they, putting on<br>
Their clothes, sat down; at length, I asked the lad<br>
What made him keen to pelt a stinking fish.<br>
Blushing he said, 'I wondered what it was.<br>
But that man, when he came to help, declared<br>
'Twould prove a dead sea-nymph, and we might see,<br>
By swimming out, how finely she was made.<br>
I did not half believe, yet when we found<br>
That foul stale fish, it made us laugh.' He smiled<br>
And watched Hipparchus spit and cough and groan.<br>
I moved to the car and unpacked bread and meat,<br>
A cheese, some fruit, a skin of wine, two bowls.<br>
Amyntas was all joy to see such things;<br>
Ran off and pulled acanthus for our plates;<br>
Chattering, he helped me set all forth, &mdash; was keen<br>
To choose rock basin where the wine might cool;<br>
Approved, was full as happy as I to praise:<br>
And most he pleased me, when he set a place<br>
For poor Hipparchus. Thus our eager work,<br>
While Delphis, in his thoughts retired, sat frowning,<br>
Grew like a home-conspiracy to trap<br>
The one who bears the brunt of outside cares<br>
Into the glow of cheerfulness that bathes<br>
The children and the mother, &mdash; happy not<br>
To foresee winter, short-commons or long debts,<br>
Since they are busied for the present meal, &mdash; <br>
Too young, too weak, too kind, to peer ahead,<br>
Or probe the dark horizon bleak with storms.<br>
Oh! I have sometimes thought there is a god<br>
Who helps with lucky accidents when folk<br>
Join with the little ones to chase such gloom.<br>
That chance which left Hipparchus with no clothes,<br>
Surely divinity was ambushed in it?<br>
When he must put on Chloe's, Amyntas rocked<br>
With laughter, and Hipparchus, quick to use<br>
A favourable gust, pretends confusion<br>
Such as a farmer's daughter red-faced shows<br>
If in the dance her dress has come unpinned.<br>
She suddenly grows grave; yet, seeing there<br>
Friends only, stoops behind a sister-skirt.<br>
Then, having set to rights the small mishap,<br>
Holding her screener's elbows, round her shoulder<br>
Peeps, to bob back meeting a young man's eye.<br>
All, grateful for such laughs, give Hermes thanks.<br>
And even Delphis at Hipparchus smiled<br>
When, from behind me, he peeped bashful forth;<br>
Amyntas called him Baucis every time,<br>
Laughing because he was or was not like<br>
Some wench ...<br>
               Why, Delphis, in the name of Zeus<br>
How come you here?</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>What can have happened, Delphis?<br>
Be brief for pity!</blockquote><br>



<i>Delphis:</i>

                  <blockquote> Nothing, mother, nothing<br>
That has not happened time on time before<br>
To thee, to Damon, when the life ye thought<br>
With pride and pleasure yours, has proved a dream.<br>
They strike down on us from the top of heaven,<br>
Bear us up in their talons, up and up,<br>
Drop us: we fall, are crippled, maimed for life.<br>
'Our dreams'? nay, we are theirs for sport, for prey,<br>
And life is the King Eagle,<br>
The strongest, highest flyer, from whose clutch<br>
The fall is fatal always.</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Delphis, Delphis,<br>
Good Damon had been making me so happy<br>
By telling ...</blockquote><br>



<i>Delphis:</i>

<blockquote>                How he watched me near the zenith?<br>
Three years back<br>
That dream pounced on me and began to soar;<br>
Having been sick, my heart had found new lies;<br>
The only thoughts I then had ears for were<br>
Healthy, virtuous, sweet;<br>
Jaded town-wastrel,<br>
A country setting was the sole could take me<br>
Three years back.<br>
Damon might have guessed<br>
From such a dizzy height<br>
What fall was coming.</blockquote><br>


<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Ah my boy, my boy!</blockquote><br>


<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>Sit down, be patient, let us hear and aid,; &mdash; <br>
Has aught befallen Amyntas?</blockquote><br>

<i>Delphis:</i>

<blockquote>Would he were dead!<br>
Would that I had been brute enough to slay him! &mdash; <br>
Great Zeus, Hipparchus had so turned his head,<br>
His every smile and word<br>
As we sat by our fire, stung my fool's heart. &mdash; <br>
How we laughed to see him curtsey,<br>
Fidget strings about his waist, &mdash; <br>
Giggle, his beard caught in the chlamys' hem<br>
Drawing it tight about his neck, 'just like<br>
Our Baucis.' Could not sleep<br>
For thinking of the life they lead in towns;<br>
He said so: when, at last,<br>
He sighed from dreamland, thoughts<br>
I had been day-long brooding<br>
Broke into vision.<br><br>

A child, a girl,<br>
Beautiful, nay more than others beautiful,<br>
Not meant for marriage, not for one man meant,<br>
You know what she will be;<br>
At six years old or seven her life is round her;<br>
A company, all ages, old men, young men,<br>
Whose vices she must prey on.<br>
And the bent crone she will be is there too,<br>
Patting her head and chuckling prophecies. &mdash; <br>
O cherry lips, O wild bird eyes,<br>
O gay invulnerable setter-at-nought<br>
Of will, of virtue &mdash; <br>
Thou art as constant a cause as is the sea,<br>
As is the sun, as are the winds, as night,<br>
Of opportunities not only but events; &mdash; <br>
The unalterable past<br>
Is full of thy contrivance,<br>
Aphrodite,<br>
Goddess of ruin!<br>
No girl; nay, nay,<br>
Amyntas is young,<br>
Is gay,<br>
Has beauty and health &mdash; and yet<br>
In his sleep I have seen him smile<br>
And known that his dream was vile;<br>
Those eyes which brimmed over with glee<br>
Till my life flowed as fresh as the sea &mdash; <br>
Those eyes, gloved each in a warm live lid,<br>
May be glad that their visions are hid.<br>
I taught myself to rhyme; the trick will cling.<br>
Ah, Damon, day-lit vision is more dread<br>
Than those which suddenly replace the dark!<br>
When the dawn filtered through our tent of boughs<br>
I saw him closely wrapped in his grey cloak,<br>
His head upon a pile of caked thin leaves<br>
Whose life had dried up full two years ago.<br>
Their flakes shook in the breath from those moist lips;<br>
The vow his kiss would seal must prove, I knew<br>
As friable as that pale ashen fritter;<br>
It had more body than reason dare expect<br>
From that so beautiful creature's best intent.<br>
He waking found me no more there; and wanders<br>
Through Ætna's woods to-day<br>
Calling at times, or questioning charcoal burners,<br>
Till he shall strike a road shall lead him home;<br>
Yet all his life must be spent as he spends<br>
This day in whistling, wondering, singing, chatting,<br>
In the great wood, vacant and amiable.</blockquote><br>

<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>Can it be possible that thou desertest<br>
Thy love, thy ward, the work of three long years,<br>
Because chance, on an April holiday<br>
Has filled this boy's talk with another man,<br>
And wonder at another way of life?<br>
Worse than a woman's is such jealousy;<br>
The lad must live!</blockquote><br>

<i>Delphis:</i>

<blockquote>Live, live! to be sure, he must live!<br>
I have lived, am a fool for my pains!<br>
And yet, and yet,<br>
This heart has ached to play the god for him: &mdash; <br>
Mine eyes for his had sifted visible things;<br>
Speech had been filtered ere it reached his ear;<br>
Not in the world should he have lived, but breathed<br>
Humanity's distilled quintessences;<br>
The indiscriminate multitude sorted should yield him<br>
Acquaintance and friend discerned, chosen by me: &mdash; <br>
By me, who failed, wrecked my youth's prime, and dragged<br>
More wonderful than his gifts in the mire!</blockquote><br>

<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>Yet if experience could not teach and save<br>
Others from ignorance, why, towns would be<br>
Ruins, and civil men like outlaws thieve,<br>
Stab, riot, ere two generations passed.</blockquote><br>

<i>Delphis:</i>

<blockquote>Where is the Athens that Pericles loved?<br>
Where are the youths that were Socrates' friends?<br>
There was a town where all learnt<br>
What the wisest had taught!<br>
Why had crude Sparta such treasonous force?<br>
Could Philip of Macedon<br>
Breed a true Greek of his son?<br>
What honour to conquer a world<br>
Where Alcibiades failed,<br>
Lead half-drilled highland hordes<br>
Whose lust would inherit the wise?<br>
There is nothing art's industry shaped<br>
But their idleness praising it mocked.<br>
Thus Fate re-assumed her command<br>
And laughed at experienced law.<br>
What ails man to love with such pains?<br>
Why toil to create in the mind<br>
Of those who shall close in his grave<br>
The best that he is and has hoped?<br>
The longer permission he has,<br>
The nobler the structure so raised,<br>
The greater its downfall. Fools, fools,     <br>
Where is a town such as Pericles ruled?     <br>
Where youths to replace those whom Socrates loved?<br>
Wise Damon, thou art silent; &mdash; Mother, thou<br>
Hast only arms to cling about thy son. &mdash; <br>
Who can descry the purpose of a god<br>
With eyes wide-open? shut them, every fool<br>
Can conjure up a world arriving somewhere,<br>
Resulting in what he may call perfection.<br>
Evil must soon or late succeed to good.<br>
There well may once have been a golden age:<br>
Why should we treat it as a poet's tale?<br>
Yet, in those hills that hung o'er Arcady,<br>
Some roving inebriate Daimon<br>
Begat him fair children<br>
On nymphs of the vineyard,<br>
On nymphs of the rock: &mdash; <br>
And in the heart of the forest<br>
Lay bound in white arms,<br>
In action creative a father<br>
Without a thought for his child: &mdash; <br>
A purposeless god,<br>
The forbear of men<br>
To corrupt, ape, inherit and spoil<br>
That fine race beforehand with doom!<br>
No, Damon, what's an answer worth to one<br>
Whose mind has been flung open?<br>
Only last night,<br>
The gates of my spirit gave entrance<br>
Unto the great light;<br>
And I saw how virtue seduceth,<br>
Not ended today or tomorrow<br>
Like the passion for love,<br>
Like the passion for life &mdash; <br>
But perennial pain<br>
And age-long effort.<br>
Dead deeds are the teeth that shine<br>
In the mouth that repeateth praise,<br>
That spurs men to do high things<br>
Since their fathers did higher before &mdash; <br>
To give more than they hope to receive,<br>
To slave and to die in a secular cause!<br>
The mouth that smiles over-praise<br>
Eats out the heart of each fool<br>
To feed the great dream of a race.<br>
Yet wearied peoples each in turn awake<br>
From virtue, as a man from his brief love,<br>
And, roughly shaken, face the useless truth;<br>
No answer to brute fact has e'er been found.<br>
Slaves of your slaves, caged in your furnished rooms,<br>
Ushered to meals when reft of appetite &mdash; <br>
Though hungry, bound to wait a stated hour &mdash; <br>
Your dearest contemplation broken off<br>
By the appointed summons to your bath;<br>
Racked with more thought for those whom you may flog<br>
Than for those dear; obsessed by your possessions<br>
With a dull round of stale anxieties; &mdash; <br>
Soon maintenance grows the extreme reach of hope<br>
For those held in respect, as in a vice,<br>
By citizens of whom they are the pick.<br>
Of men the least bond is the roving seaman<br>
Who hires himself to merchantman or pirate<br>
For single voyages, stays where he may please,<br>
Lives his purse empty in a dozen ports,<br>
And ne'er obeys the ghost of what once was!<br>
His laugh chimes readily; his kiss, no symbol<br>
Of aught to come, but cordial, eager, hot,<br>
Leaves his tomorrow free. With him for comrade<br>
Each day shall be enough, and what is good<br>
Enjoyed, and what is evil borne or cursed.<br>
I go, because I will not have a home,<br>
Or here prefer to there, or near to far.<br>
I go, because I will not have a friend<br>
Lay claim upon my leisure this day week.<br>
I will be melted by each smile that takes me;<br>
What though a hundred lips should meet with mine!<br>
A vagabond I shall be as the moon is.<br>
The sun, the waves, the winds, all birds, all beasts,<br>
Are ever on the move, and take what comes;<br>
They are not parasites like plants and men<br>
Rooted in that which fed them yesterday.<br>
Not even Memory shall follow Delphis,<br>
For I will yield to all impulse save hers,<br>
Therein alone subject to prescient rigour;<br>
Lest she should lure me back among the dying &mdash; <br>
Pilfer the present for the beggar past.<br>
Free minds must bargain with each greedy moment<br>
And seize the most that lies to hand at once.<br>
Ye are too old to understand my words;<br>
I yet have youth enough, and can escape<br>
From that which sucks each individual man<br>
Into the common dream.</blockquote><br>

<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Stay, Delphis, hear what Damon has to say!<br>
He is mad!</blockquote><br>

<i>Damon:</i>

<blockquote>Mad &mdash; yes &mdash; mad as cruelty!<br>
       *       *       *       *       *<br>
Poor, poor Cydilla! was it then to this<br>
That all my tale was prologue?<br>
Think of Amyntas, think of that poor boy,<br>
Bereaved as we are both bereaved! Come, come,<br>
Find him, and say that Love himself has sent us<br>
To offer our poor service in his stead.</blockquote><br>

<i>Cydilla:</i>

<blockquote>Good Damon, help me find my wool; my eyes<br>
Are blind with tears; then I will come at once!<br>
We must be doing something, for I feel<br>
We both shall drown our hearts with time to spare.</blockquote>

<h3>The Cuckoo Wood</h3>

<blockquote>Cuckoo, are you calling me,<br>
Or is it a voice of wizardry?<br>
In these woodlands I am lost,<br>
From glade to glade of flowers tost.<br>
Seven times I held my way,<br>
And seven times the voice did say,<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! No man could<br>
Issue from this underwood,<br>
Half of green and half of brown,<br>
Unless he laid his senses down.<br>
Only let him chance to see<br>
The snows of the anemone<br>
Heaped above its greenery;<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! No man could<br>
Issue from the master wood.<br><br>

Magic paths there are that cross;<br>
Some beset with jewelled moss<br>
And boughs all bare; where others run,<br>
Bluebells bathe in mist and sun<br>
Past a clearing filled with clumps<br>
Of primrose round the nutwood stumps;<br>
All as gay as gay can be,<br>
And bordered with dog-mercury,<br>
The wizard flower, the wizard green,<br>
Like a Persian carpet seen.<br>
Brown, dead bracken lies between,<br>
And wrinkled leaves, whence fronds of fern<br>
Still untwist and upward turn.<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! No man could<br>
Issue from this wizard wood,<br>
Half of green, and half of brown,<br>
Unless he laid his senses down.<br><br>

Seven times I held my way<br>
Where new heaps of brushwood lay,<br>
All with withies loosely bound,<br>
And never heard a human sound.<br>
Yet men have toiled and men have rested<br>
By yon hurdles darkly-breasted,<br>
Woven in and woven out,<br>
Piled four-square, and turned about<br>
To show their white and sharpened stakes<br>
Like teeth of hounds or fangs of snakes.<br>
The men are homeward sped, for none<br>
Loves silence and a sinking sun.<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Woodmen know<br>
Souls are lost that hear it so,<br>
Seven times upon the wind,<br>
To lull the watch-dogs of the mind.<br><br>

A stranger wood you shall not find!<br>
Beech and birch and oak agree<br>
Here to dwell in company.<br>
Hazel, elder, few men could<br>
Name the kinds of underwood.<br>
Summer and winter haunt together,<br>
And golden light with misty weather.<br>
'Tis summer where this beech is seen<br>
Defenceless in its virgin green;<br>
All its leaves are smooth and thin,<br>
And the sunlight passes in,<br>
Passes in and filters through<br>
To a green heaven below the blue.<br>
Low the branches fall and trace<br>
A circle round that mystic place,<br>
Guarded on its outward side<br>
By hyacinths in all their pride;<br>
And within dim moons appear,<br>
Wax and wane &mdash; I go not near!<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! How we fear<br>
Sights and sounds that come and go<br>
Without a cause for men to know!<br><br>

Why for a whispered doubt should I<br>
Shun that other beech-tree high,<br>
Red and watchful, still and bare,<br>
With a thousand spears in air,<br>
Guarding yet its treasured leaf<br>
From storm and hail and winter's grief?<br>
Unregarded on the ground<br>
Leaves of yester-year abound,<br>
For what is autumn's gold to one<br>
That hoards a life scarce yet begun?<br>
Let me so renew my youth,<br>
I defend it, nail and tooth,<br>
Rooting deep and lifting high.<br>
For this my dead leaves hiss and sigh<br>
And glow as on the downward road<br>
To the dog-snake's dread abode.<br>
Noxious things of earth and air,<br>
Get you hence, for I prepare<br>
To flaunt my beauty in the sun<br>
When all beside me are undone.<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Pan shall see<br>
The surge of my virginity<br>
Overtop the sobered glade.<br>
Luminous and unafraid<br>
Near his sacred oak I'll spread<br>
Lures to tempt him from his bed:<br>
His couch, his lair his form shall be<br>
By none but by the fair beech-tree.<br><br>

O cunning Oak! What is your skill<br>
To hold the god against my will?<br>
Keep your favours back like me,<br>
With disfavour he shall see<br>
Orange hues of jealousy:<br>
Show your leaf in early prime,<br>
It shall be dark before its time:<br>
Me you shall not rival ever.<br>
Silver Birch, would you endeavour,<br>
Trembling in your bridal dress,<br>
To win at last a dog's caress?<br>
Through your twigs so thin and dark<br>
Shows the black and ashen bark,<br>
Like a face that underneath<br>
Tightened eyebrows looks on death.<br>
Think not, dwarf, that Pan shall find<br>
Aught about you to his mind.<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! All shall try<br>
To win him. But the beech and I,<br>
Man and tree made one at last,<br>
Alone have power to hold him fast.<br><br>

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Forth I creep,<br>
When the flowers fall asleep,<br>
And upgather odours rare<br>
Floating on the misty air,<br>
All to be imprisoned where<br>
My sap is rising till they reach<br>
The swelling twigs, and thence shall each<br>
Separate scent be shaken free<br>
As my flowers and leaves agree.<br>
Rare in sooth those flowers shall be:<br>
Cunningly will I devise<br>
Colours to delight the eyes,<br>
Slipping from my fissured stem<br>
To get by stealth or stratagem<br>
The glory of the morning petal.<br>
Where the bees at noontide settle,<br>
Mine to rifle all their sweets:<br>
Honey and bee-bread on the teats<br>
Of my blossoms shall be spread,<br>
Till the lime-trees shake with dread<br>
Of the marvels still to come<br>
When their bees about me hum.<br><br>

Welcome, welcome, cloudless night,<br>
Is our labour ended quite?<br>
Are the mortal and the tree<br>
Now made one in ecstasy,<br>
One in foretaste of the dawn?<br>
Crescent moon, sink, sink outworn!<br>
Stars be buried, stars be born,<br>
Mount and dip to tell aright<br>
The doings of the morrow's light!<br>
Mists, assemble, hide me quite,<br>
Till the sun with growing strength<br>
Grips your veils, and length by length<br>
Tears them down from head to foot;<br>
Then to the challenge I am put!<br><br>

Tell me busy, busy glade,<br>
Half in light and half in shade,<br>
Is your world of wood-folk there?<br>
All are come but the mole and hare;<br>
One is blind, and underground<br>
Of that tumult hears no sound;<br>
The other Pan has crept within,<br>
To bask afield in the hare-skin.<br>
All are come of woodland fowl<br>
But the cuckoo and the owl;<br>
The owl's asleep, and the cuckoo-bird<br>
Nowhere seen is eachwhere heard.<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Those that see<br>
The leafing of this great beech-tree,<br>
And its flowers of every kind,<br>
Woodland lovers have in mind;<br>
Those that breathe the scented wind<br>
Or touch this bark of satin, could<br>
Never issue from our wood.<br><br>

Tell me, busy, busy glade,<br>
Are little flying things afraid?<br>
All are come of aery folk,<br>
Gnats that hover like a smoke,<br>
Butterflies and humble-bees,<br>
Insects winged in all degrees,<br>
Honey-toilers, pleasure-makers,<br>
Of labours and of joys forsakers,<br>
Round these boughs to live and die.<br>
Only the moth and the dragon-fly<br>
Keep their haunts and come not nigh:<br>
The moth is moonstruck, she must creep<br>
With twitching wings, and half-asleep,<br>
Through folds of darkness; and that other,<br>
The dragon-fly, Narcissus' brother,<br>
Flashes all his burnished mail<br>
In a still pool adown the dale.<br><br>

Tell me, busy, busy glade,<br>
Shifting aye in light and shade,<br>
Are the dryads peeping forth,<br>
More in wonder than in wrath,<br>
Each beneath her own dear tree<br>
Parting her hair that she may see<br>
How queens put on their sovereignty?<br>
All are come of Pan's own race,<br>
Nymphs and satyrs fill the place,<br>
Necks outstretched and ears a-twitching,<br>
That Pan may know of all this witching.<br>
Heedless stumble the goatfeet<br>
Till four-footed things retreat.<br>
Cries of Ah! and Ay! and Eh!<br>
Scare the forest birds away,<br>
And their notes that rang so clear<br>
At dawn, you now shall rarely hear:<br>
Only a robin here and there<br>
Pitches high his trembling voice<br>
In a challenge to rejoice.<br><br>

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! How two notes<br>
Stolen from all woodland throats<br>
Make the satyrs stand like stone,<br>
Waiting for Pan to call his own!<br>
How the couching dryads seem<br>
To root themselves as in a dream,<br>
And the naiads, wan and whist,<br>
To melt into an evening mist!<br><br>

Tell me, silent, silent glade,<br>
All in light that once was shade,<br>
All in shade that once was light,<br>
How went the creatures from my sight?<br>
Where are the shapes that turned to stone,<br>
And my tree that reigned alone?<br>
Red and watchful, still and bare,<br>
With a thousand spears in air,<br>
Stands the beech that you would bind<br>
Unlawfully to human mind.<br>
Gone is every woodland elf<br>
To the mighty god himself.<br>
Mortal! You yourself are fast!<br>
Doubt not Pan shall come at last<br>
To put a leer within your eyes<br>
That pry into his mysteries.<br>
He shall touch the busy brain<br>
Lest it ever teem again;<br>
Point the ears and twist the feet,<br>
Till by day you dare not meet<br>
Men, or in the failing light<br>
Mutter more than, Friend, good-night!<br><br>

Tell me, whispering, whispering glade,<br>
Am I eager or afraid?<br>
Do I wish the god to come?<br>
What shall I say if he be dumb?<br>
Tell me, wherefore hiss and sigh<br>
Those shrivelled leaves? Has Pan gone by?<br>
Why do your thousand pools of light<br>
Gaze like eyes that fade at night?<br>
Pan has but twain, Pan's eyes are bright!<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! See, yon stakes<br>
Gape and grin like fangs of snakes;<br>
Not snakes nor hounds are mouthing thus;<br>
Pan himself is watching us.<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Now<br>
The god is breasting the hill-brow.<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Pan is near:<br>
Joy runs trembling back to fear.<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! All my blood<br>
Knocks through the heart whose every thud<br>
Chokes me, blinds me, drains my madness.<br>
As one half-drowned, I feel life's gladness<br>
Ooze from each pore. Towards the sun<br>
Downhill I reel that fain would run.<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Thornless seem<br>
Briars that part as in a dream.<br>
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Hazel-boughs<br>
Hurt not though they blood the brows.<br><br>

Cuckoo! In a meadow prone<br>
At last I lie, my wits my own;<br>
And in my hand I clasp the flower<br>
To counteract that magic power;<br>
The cuckoo-flower, in a lilac sheet<br>
Under body, head and feet.<br>
Above me apple-blossoms fleck<br>
The cloudless sky, a neighbouring beck<br>
With many a happy gurgle goes<br>
Down to the farm through alder-rows.<br>
Strange it is, and it is sweet,<br>
To hear the distant mill-wheel beat,<br>
And the kindly cries of men<br>
Turning the cattle home again,<br>
The clank of pails and all the shades<br>
Of laughter of the busy maids.<br>
Now is come the evening star,<br>
And my limbs new-blooded are.<br>
So beside the stream I choose<br>
A path that patient anglers use,<br>
Which with many twists and turns<br>
Brings me where a candle burns,<br>
A lowly light, through cottage pane<br>
Seen and hid and seen again.<br>
Cuckoo! Now you call in vain.<br>
I am far and I am free<br>
From all woodland wizardry!</blockquote>

<h3>In the Poppy Field</h3>

<blockquote>Mad Patsy said, he said to me,<br>
That every morning he could see<br>
An angel walking on the sky;<br>
Across the sunny skies of morn<br>
He threw great handfuls far and nigh<br>
Of poppy seed among the corn;<br>
And then, he said, the angels run<br>
To see the poppies in the sun.<br><br>

A poppy is a devil weed,<br>
I said to him &mdash; he disagreed;<br>
He said the devil had no hand<br>
In spreading flowers tall and fair<br>
Through corn and rye and meadow land,<br>
By garth and barrow everywhere:<br>
The devil has not any flower,<br>
But only money in his power.<br><br>

And then he stretched out in the sun<br>
And rolled upon his back for fun:<br>
He kicked his legs and roared for joy<br>
Because the sun was shining down,<br>
He said he was a little boy<br>
And would not work for any clown:<br>
He ran and laughed behind a bee,<br>
And danced for very ecstasy.</blockquote><br>

A sound, a little sound? My curious ear<br>
Is dinned with flying noises, and the tree<br>
Goes &mdash; whisper, whisper, whisper silently<br>
Till all its whispers spread into the sound<br>
Of a dull roar. Lie closer to the ground,<br>
The shade is deep and He may pass us by.<br>
We are so very small, and His great eye,<br>
Customed to starry majesties, may gaze<br>
Too wide to spy us hiding in the maze;<br>
Ah, misery! the sun has not yet gone<br>
And we are naked: He will look upon<br>
Our crouching shame, may make us stand upright<br>
Burning in terror &mdash; O that it were night!<br>

<a name="lonegod"></a><h3>The Lonely God</h3>

<blockquote>So Eden was deserted, and at eve<br>
Into the quiet place God came to grieve.<br>
His face was sad, His hands hung slackly down<br>
Along his robe; too sorrowful to frown<br>
He paced along the grassy paths and through<br>
The silent trees, and where the flowers grew<br>
Tended by Adam. All the birds had gone<br>
Out to the world, and singing was not one<br>
To cheer the lonely God out of His grief &mdash; <br>
The silence broken only when a leaf<br>
Tapt lightly on a leaf, or when the wind,<br>
Slow-handed, swayed the bushes to its mind.<br><br>

And so along the base of a round hill,<br>
Rolling in fern, He bent His way until<br>
He neared the little hut which Adam made,<br>
And saw its dusky rooftree overlaid<br>
With greenest leaves. Here Adam and his spouse<br>
Were wont to nestle in their little house<br>
Snug at the dew-time: here He, standing sad,<br>
Sighed with the wind, nor any pleasure had<br>
In heavenly knowledge, for His darlings twain<br>
Had gone from Him to learn the feel of pain,<br>
And what was meant by sorrow and despair, &mdash; <br>
Drear knowledge for a Father to prepare.<br><br>

There he looked sadly on the little place;<br>
A beehive round it was, without a trace<br>
Of occupant or owner; standing dim<br>
Among the gloomy trees it seemed to Him<br>
A final desolation, the last word<br>
Wherewith the lips of silence had been stirred.<br>
Chaste and remote, so tiny and so shy,<br>
So new withal, so lost to any eye,<br>
So pac't of memories all innocent<br>
Of days and nights that in it had been spent<br>
In blithe communion, Adam, Eve, and He,<br>
Afar from Heaven and its gaudery;<br>
And now no more! He still must be the God<br>
But not the friend; a Father with a rod<br>
Whose voice was fear, whose countenance a threat,<br>
Whose coming terror, and whose going wet<br>
With penitential tears; not evermore<br>
Would they run forth to meet Him as before<br>
With careless laughter, striving each to be<br>
First to His hand and dancing in their glee<br>
To see Him coming &mdash; they would hide instead<br>
At His approach, or stand and hang the head,<br>
Speaking in whispers, and would learn to pray<br>
Instead of asking, 'Father, if we may.'<br><br>

Never again to Eden would He haste<br>
At cool of evening, when the sun had paced<br>
Back from the tree-tops, slanting from the rim<br>
Of a low cloud, what time the twilight dim<br>
Knit tree to tree in shadow, gathering slow<br>
Till all had met and vanished in the flow<br>
Of dusky silence, and a brooding star<br>
Stared at the growing darkness from afar,<br>
While haply now and then some nested bird<br>
Would lift upon the air a sleepy word<br>
Most musical, or swing its airy bed<br>
To the high moon that drifted overhead.<br><br>

'Twas good to quit at evening His great throne,<br>
To lay His crown aside, and all alone<br>
Down through the quiet air to stoop and glide<br>
Unkenned by angels: silently to hide<br>
In the green fields, by dappled shades, where brooks<br>
Through leafy solitudes and quiet nooks<br>
Flowed far from heavenly majesty and pride,   <br>
From light astounding and the wheeling tide<br>
Of roaring stars. Thus does it ever seem<br>
Good to the best to stay aside and dream<br>
In narrow places, where the hand can feel<br>
Something beside, and know that it is real.<br>
His angels! silly creatures who could sing<br>
And sing again, and delicately fling<br>
The smoky censer, bow and stand aside<br>
All mute in adoration: thronging wide,<br>
Till nowhere could He look but soon He saw<br>
An angel bending humbly to the law<br>
Mechanic; knowing nothing more of pain,<br>
Than when they were forbid to sing again,<br>
Or swing anew the censer, or bow down<br>
In humble adoration of His frown.<br>
This was the thought in Eden as He trod &mdash; <br>
... It is a lonely thing to be a God.<br><br>

So long! afar through Time He bent His mind,<br>
For the beginning, which He could not find,<br>
Through endless centuries and backwards still<br>
Endless for ever, till His 'stonied will<br>
Halted in circles, dizzied in the swing<br>
Of mazy nothingness. &mdash; His mind could bring<br>
Not to subjection, grip or hold the theme<br>
Whose wide horizon melted like a dream<br>
To thinnest edges. Infinite behind<br>
The piling centuries were trodden blind<br>
In gulfs chaotic &mdash; so He could not see<br>
When He was not who always had To Be.<br><br>

Not even godly fortitude can stare<br>
Into Eternity, nor easy bear<br>
The insolent vacuity of Time:<br>
It is too much, the mind can never climb<br>
Up to its meaning, for, without an end,<br>
Without beginning, plan, or scope, or trend<br>
To point a path, there nothing is to hold<br>
And steady surmise: so the mind is rolled<br>
And swayed and drowned in dull Immensity.<br>
Eternity outfaces even Me<br>
With its indifference, and the fruitless year<br>
Would swing as fruitless were I never here.<br><br>

And so for ever, day and night the same,<br>
Years flying swiftly nowhere, like a game<br>
Played random by a madman, without end<br>
Or any reasoned object but to spend<br>
What is unspendable &mdash; Eternal Woe!<br>
O Weariness of Time that fast or slow<br>
Goes never further, never has in view<br>
An ending to the thing it seeks to do,<br>
And so does nothing: merely ebb and flow,<br>
From nowhere into nowhere, touching so<br>
The shores of many stars and passing on,<br>
Careless of what may come or what has gone.<br><br>

O solitude unspeakable! to be<br>
For ever with oneself! never to see<br>
An equal face, or feel an equal hand,<br>
To sit in state and issue reprimand,<br>
Admonishment or glory, and to smile<br>
Disdaining what has happenèd the while!<br>
O to be breast to breast against a foe!<br>
Against a friend! to strive and not to know<br>
The laboured outcome: love nor be aware<br>
How much the other loved, and greatly care<br>
With passion for that happy love or hate,<br>
Nor know what joy or dole was hid in fate,<br>
For I have ranged the spacy width and gone<br>
Swift north and south, striving to look upon<br>
An ending somewhere. Many days I sped<br>
Hard to the west, a thousand years I fled<br>
Eastwards in fury, but I could not find<br>
The fringes of the Infinite. Behind<br>
And yet behind, and ever at the end<br>
Came new beginnings, paths that did not wend<br>
To anywhere were there: and ever vast<br>
And vaster spaces opened &mdash; till at last<br>
Dizzied with distance, thrilling to a pain<br>
Unnameable, I turned to Heaven again.<br>
And there My angels were prepared to fling<br>
The cloudy incense, there prepared to sing<br>
My praise and glory &mdash; O, in fury I<br>
Then roared them senseless, then threw down the sky<br>
And stamped upon it, buffeted a star<br>
With My great fist, and flung the sun afar:<br>
Shouted My anger till the mighty sound<br>
Rung to the width, frighting the furthest bound<br>
And scope of hearing: tumult vaster still,<br>
Thronging the echo, dinned My ears, until<br>
I fled in silence, seeking out a place<br>
To hide Me from the very thought of Space.<br><br>

And so, He thought, in Mine own Image I<br>
Have made a man, remote from Heaven high<br>
And all its humble angels: I have poured<br>
My essence in his nostrils: I have cored<br>
His heart with My own spirit; part of Me,<br>
His mind with laboured growth unceasingly<br>
Must strive to equal Mine; must ever grow<br>
By virtue of My essence till he know<br>
Both good and evil through the solemn test<br>
Of sin and retribution, till, with zest,<br>
He feels his godhead, soars to challenge Me<br>
In Mine own Heaven for supremacy.<br><br>

Through savage beasts and still more savage clay,<br>
Invincible, I bid him fight a way<br>
To greater battles, crawling through defeat<br>
Into defeat again: ordained to meet<br>
Disaster in disaster; prone to fall,<br>
I prick him with My memory to call<br>
Defiance at his victor and arise<br>
With anguished fury to his greater size<br>
Through tribulation, terror, and despair.<br>
Astounded, he must fight to higher air,<br>
Climb battle into battle till he be<br>
Confronted with a flaming sword and Me.<br><br>

So growing age by age to greater strength,<br>
To greater beauty, skill and deep intent:<br>
With wisdom wrung from pain, with energy<br>
Nourished in sin and sorrow, he will be<br>
Strong, pure and proud an enemy to meet,<br>
Tremendous on a battle-field, or sweet<br>
To walk by as a friend with candid mind.<br>
 &mdash; Dear enemy or friend so hard to find,<br>
I yet shall find you, yet shall put My breast<br>
In enmity or love against your breast:<br>
Shall smite or clasp with equal ecstasy<br>
The enemy or friend who grows to Me.<br><br>

The topmost blossom of his growing I<br>
Shall take unto Me, cherish and lift high<br>
Beside Myself upon My holy throne: &mdash; <br>
It is not good for God to be alone.<br>
The perfect woman of his perfect race<br>
Shall sit beside Me in the highest place<br>
And be My Goddess, Queen, Companion, Wife,<br>
The rounder of My majesty, the life,<br>
Of My ambition. She will smile to see<br>
Me bending down to worship at her knee<br>
Who never bent before, and she will say,<br>
'Dear God, who was it taught <i>Thee</i> how to pray?'<br><br>

And through eternity, adown the slope<br>
Of never-ending time, compact of hope,<br>
Of zest and young enjoyment, I and She<br>
Will walk together, sowing jollity<br>
Among the raving stars, and laughter through<br>
The vacancies of Heaven, till the blue<br>
Vast amplitudes of space lift up a song,<br>
The echo of our presence, rolled along<br>
And ever rolling where the planets sing<br>
The majesty and glory of the King.<br>
Then conquered, thou, Eternity, shalt lie<br>
Under My hand as little as a fly.<br><br>

I am the Master: I the mighty God<br>
And you My workshop. Your pavilions trod<br>
By Me and Mine shall never cease to be,<br>
For you are but the magnitude of Me,<br>
The width of My extension, the surround<br>
Of My dense splendour. Rolling, rolling round,<br>
To steeped infinity, and out beyond<br>
My own strong comprehension, you are bond<br>
And servile to My doings. Let you swing<br>
More wide and ever wide, you do but fling<br>
Around this instant Me, and measure still<br>
The breadth and the proportion of My Will.<br><br>
Then stooping to the hut &mdash; a beehive round &mdash; <br>
God entered in and saw upon the ground<br>
The dusty garland, Adam, (learned to weave)<br>
Had loving placed upon the head of Eve<br>
Before the terror came, when joyous they<br>
Could look for God at closing of the day<br>
Profound and happy. So the Mighty Guest<br>
Rent, took, and placed the blossoms in His breast.<br>
'This,' said He gently, 'I shall show My queen<br>
When she hath grown to Me in space serene,<br>
And say "'twas worn by Eve."' So, smiling fair,<br>
He spread abroad His wings upon the air.</blockquote>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
