BASEBALL JOE ON THE
GIANTS




CHAPTER I
PUTTING THEM OVER


“Now then, Joe, send it over!”

“Show us what you can do!”

“Make the ball hum!”

“Split the ozone!”

These and a host of similar cries greeted Joe
Matson as he carelessly caught the ball tossed
to him by one of his friends and walked over to a
corner of the gymnasium that was marked off as
a pitcher’s box.

“All right, fellows,” he answered, laughingly.
“Anything to oblige my friends.”

“And that means all of us, Joe,” cried one of
the boys heartily.

“You bet it does!” chorused the others, with a
fervor that spoke volumes for the popularity of
the young pitcher.

It was a cold day in late winter and a large[2]
number of the village youth had gathered at the
Riverside gymnasium. Riverside was Joe’s home
town where his people had lived for years, and
where he always spent the months between the
ending of one baseball season and the beginning
of the next.

Joe wound up, while the spectators stretched
out in a long line and waited with interest for
the first ball.

“Not too hot at the start, Joe,” cautioned Tom
Davis, his old-time chum, who stood ready at the
receiving end. “Remember I’m out of practice
just now and I don’t want you to lift me off my
feet.”

“All right, old scout,” returned Joe. “I’m not
any too anxious myself to pitch my arm out at the
start. I’ll just float up a few teasers to begin
with.”

He let the ball go without any conscious effort,
and it sailed lazily across the sixty feet that represented
the distance between himself and Tom,
who stood directly behind the plate that had
been improvised for the occasion. It was a drop
that broke just before it reached the plate and
shot downward into Tom’s extended glove.

“That was a pretty one,” said Tom. “Now
give us an upshoot.”

Joe complied, and then in response to requests
from the crowd gave them specimens of his[3]
“knuckle” ball, his in-and-out curves, his “fadeaway,”
and in fact everything he had in stock.

Then with a twinkle in his eyes, seeing that
Tom by this time was pretty well warmed up, he
cut loose a fast one that traveled so swiftly that
the eye could scarcely follow it. It landed in
Tom’s glove with a report like the crack of a
whip, and a roar of laughter went up from the
crowd as Tom danced around rubbing his hands.

“Wow!” he yelled. “That one had whiskers
on it for fair. Have a heart, Joe. I’m too young
to die.”

“Don’t worry about dying, Tom,” piped up
Dick Little. “Only the good die young, and that
makes you safe for a while.”

“Is that the kind you feed to old Wagner when
he comes up to the plate and shakes his hat at
you?” asked Ben Atkins.

“It doesn’t matter much what you serve to
that tough old bird,” answered Joe grimly. “He
lams them all if they come within reach.”

“How fast do you suppose that last ball of
yours was traveling anyway, Joe?” asked Ed
Wilson.

“Oh, I don’t know exactly,” answered Joe carelessly.
“Something over a hundred feet a second.”

A buzz of astonishment went up from the
throng and they crowded closer around Joe.

[4]

“A hundred feet a second!” ejaculated Sam
Berry, who was connected with the railroad.
“Why a railroad train traveling at the rate of a
mile a minute only covers eighty-eight feet a second.
Do you mean to say that that ball was traveling
faster than a mile a minute train?”

“According to that, Joe could throw a ball
after the Empire State Express when it was running
at that speed and hit the rear platform,”
was the incredulous comment of Ben Atkins. “I
knew that ball was going mighty fast but I didn’t
think it was as swift as that.”

“It’s a pity that there isn’t some certain way
of finding out,” commented Tom.

“It has been found out,” said Joe calmly.

“Is that so?”

“How was it done?”

“Why,” replied Joe, in answer to the volley of
questions fired at him, “it wasn’t a hard thing at
all. You know the big arms factories have a contrivance
that tells them just how fast a bullet
goes after it leaves the gun. They have two hoops
set in a line say two hundred feet apart. These
hoops are covered with a mesh of fine wires that
are connected by electricity with a signal room.
The bullet as it goes through the first hoop cuts
a wire which registers the exact fraction of a
second at which it is hit. The bullet strikes another
wire as it goes through the second hoop[5]
and this also registers. Then all they have to do
is to subtract the first time from the second and
they have the exact time it has taken for the bullet
to go that two hundred feet.”

“Seems simple enough when you come to think
of it,” remarked Tom.

“Then,” went on Joe, “it struck somebody that
it would be perfectly easy to rig up a couple of
hoops sixty feet apart and let a pitcher hurl a
straight ball through both and then measure the
different times at which it struck the two hoops.
They did it down at some Connecticut plant and
got two of the swiftest pitchers in the big leagues
to try out their speed. One of them put it through
at the rate of one hundred and twelve feet a second
and the other at the rate of one hundred and
twenty-two feet a second. That’s why I said that
that last ball of mine was going at over a hundred
feet a second.”

“Guess you knew what you were talking about,
old boy,” said Tom, as he walked back to take his
place again at the receiving end. “But after this,
cut down the speed to eighty or thereabouts.
That’ll be rich enough for my blood at present.”

“All right,” grinned Joe. “We’ll cut out the
fast straight ones and work out a few of the
curves.”

“Just what do you mean by curves?” asked a
rather gruff voice.

[6]

Joe turned and recognized Professor Enoch
Crabbe of the Riverside Academy, who had been
strolling by, and having caught a glimpse of the
unusual number present through the open door,
had concluded to add himself to the spectators.
He was a man generally respected in the town,
but very positive and set in his views and not at
all diffident about expressing them.

“Good afternoon, Professor,” said Joe. “I
didn’t quite understand what you meant by your
question. I was just going to curve the ball&mdash;&mdash;”

“That’s just it,” interrupted the professor with
a superior smile. “You thought you were going
to curve the direction of the ball, but you were
going to do nothing of the kind. It can’t be
done.”

“But Professor,” expostulated Joe, a little bewildered,
“the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
I’ve done it a thousand times.”

“I don’t question your good faith at all, Mr.
Matson,” said the professor, still with that smug
air of certainty. “You undoubtedly think you
curved the ball. I positively know that you
didn’t.”

“Well,” retorted Joe, who was getting a little
nettled, “they say that seeing is believing. Just
watch this ball.”

He gripped it firmly and sent in a wide outcurve.
The ball went straight as a die for perhaps[7]
forty feet and then turned swiftly outward
so that Tom had to jump to get his hands on it.

“Now,” said Joe triumphantly, “if that wasn’t
a curve, what was it?”

“An optical delusion,” replied the professor
blandly.

“If a batter had been at the plate, he’d have
broken his back reaching out after it,” Joe came
back at him. “He wouldn’t have thought it was
an optical delusion.”

“My dear sir,” said the professor smoothly,
“the first law of motion is that a body set in motion
tends to move in a straight line. Neither you
nor anybody else can change that law. You might
as well tell me that you can shoot a gun around
a corner as that you can throw a ball around a
corner.”

“I can throw it around the corner,” maintained
Joe stoutly. “Not at right angles, of course, but
I can make the ball go into the side street.”

The theorist smiled in a way that was exceedingly
irritating. But Joe, by a great effort, mastered
his annoyance.

“We won’t quarrel over it, Professor,” he remarked
good-naturedly. “All I can say is that I
must be getting my salary under false pretences,
because the men who pay it to me do so under the
impression that I can curve the ball. I’ve always
had that impression myself, and so have the batters[8]
who have faced me. Rather odd, don’t you
think, that so many people should be so misled?”

“Not at all,” replied the professor pompously.
“Truth is usually on the side of the minority.”

“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” said Joe thoughtfully.
“I know a moving picture operator, who’s
an old friend of mine and who’d be glad, if I asked
him, to do me a favor. I’ll get him to come down
some day and take a picture of the ball in motion.
Then we’ll study out the film and I think
I can prove to you that the ball does curve on its
way from the pitcher to the catcher.”

“How do you think you could prove anything
from that?” asked Professor Crabbe cautiously,
as though he were looking for a trap. “They can
work all sorts of tricks with moving pictures, you
know.”

“I know they can,” admitted Joe. “But this
would be ‘honest Injun.’ You’d have my word of
honor and the operator’s, too, that there’d be no
monkeying with the pictures.”

“Well,” said Crabbe, “admitting that the pictures
were honestly taken, how could they show
whether the ball curved or not?”

“I’m not sure myself exactly,” answered Joe,
“but it seems to me that if the ball moved in a
straight line all the way, it would look the same
at any point. But if it curved, it would be farther
away from the camera than when it was going[9]
straight and there’d be a different focus. The
ball would look flatter, more oval shaped&mdash;&mdash;”

Just then came a wild diversion.

Into the gymnasium crowd burst a shock-headed
boy, his eyes blazing with excitement, his breath
coming in gasps. All looked at him in astonishment
and alarm.

“A crazy man,” stammered the boy. “He’s
stolen the Bilkins baby and run off with it!”



[10]




CHAPTER II
A FEARFUL SITUATION


There was a general gasp of horror mixed
with unbelief.

“What do you mean?” demanded Sam Berry.

“Where did you get that yarn?” asked Ed Wilson.

“It’s true,” declared the boy. “The whole
town’s hunting for him. He ran into Mrs. Bilkins’
house and snatched the baby from the cradle.
The man was bareheaded and didn’t have any
coat. Mrs. Bilkins ran after him, screaming, but
she couldn’t catch him and&mdash;&mdash;”

But the rest of the lad’s story fell on deaf ears.
Joe and Tom and the others had already slipped
into their coats, and now they poured pell-mell
out of the door, each of them eager to be first on
the scene and rescue the kidnapped baby before the
madman could do it harm.

They all knew and liked Bilkins, who was a
bright young fellow employed in the Harvester
works. Three years before he had married and
brought his bride to a pretty little cottage at the[11]
southern edge of the town. Their one baby was
now nearly a year old and of course the young
parents were wrapt up in him.

Joe and his sister Clara had often spent a pleasant
evening at the Bilkins home, and the heart of
the young pitcher was hot within him as he raced
in that direction, while his sympathy gave wings
to his feet.

A light snow had fallen and this would have
been of some assistance in tracing the marauder,
but so many people had by this time joined in the
hunt that many trails led in as many different directions.

Joe and Tom were circling wildly around, like
hounds trying to pick up a lost scent, when a little
fellow ran up to them.

“I saw him!” he cried, “a big, tall man carrying
a baby! He was going down to the lumber yard.”

Like a flash Joe turned and headed the crowd
that rushed in the direction pointed out.

And while he is thus racing along, it may be
well, for the benefit of those who are not yet acquainted
with this clever young pitcher, to mention
the previous books of this series in which “Baseball
Joe,” as he was affectionately known, has
taken a leading part.

The beginning of his career on the diamond
is told in the first volume of the series, entitled:
“Baseball Joe of the Silver Stars; Or, The Rivals[12]
of Riverside.” Here Joe had his first real experience
in the box. He had to fight hard to make
good, but he did it, and soon became widely known
in that section as one of the best of the amateur
pitchers. There were many things that sought to
hinder him, but he worked like a Trojan and
brought his team to the front.

In “Baseball Joe on the School Nine,” we
find Joe in that same gritty way of his “making”
the school team. There were rivalries here of
a different kind than he had met before, and the
bully of the school succeeded for a time in making
things very unpleasant. But Joe had the
“class” as a ball player that was bound to make
itself felt, and in a great crisis he rose to the
emergency and at the last moment brought victory
from defeat.

From Excelsior Hall, Joe went to Yale, and his
career in the great university is told in the third
volume of the series called “Baseball Joe at Yale;
Or, Pitching for the College Championship.”

Traditions are very strong at Yale and one
of them that is seldom broken is that no Freshman
shall play on a ’Varsity Team. No matter
how good he is, he has to win his spurs first on
his class team before he can aspire to the ranks
of the ’Varsity. Joe had to undergo his apprenticeship,
and a hard one it was. But his light
could not be kept under a bushel, and by sheer[13]
force of merit he finally captured the attention of
the leaders in athletics. A combination of circumstances
put it up to him to pitch for Yale
against Princeton in the deciding game of the season
at the Polo Grounds, and although the test
was a severe one the “Yale bulldog” scored a glorious
victory over the “Princeton tiger.”

But, despite the successes he had won, Joe was
not altogether happy at Yale. His good mother
wanted him to study to be a minister, but, while
Joe appreciated what a noble calling it was, he
did not feel himself cut out for a preacher.
Though bright enough in his studies, he was not
a natural scholar. Outdoor life had strong attractions
for him, and his love for baseball combined
with his natural abilities in that direction
made him feel strongly inclined to take up professional
baseball as his regular vocation.

His mother was grieved and almost shocked
by this decision of his. She had longed to see her
boy in the pulpit, and she had the mistaken feeling,
shared by many good women, that there was
something that was almost disreputable in being
a professional ball player. But Joe was so earnest
in his conviction that it was better to be a
good ball player than a poor professional man,
whether doctor, lawyer or minister, that his
mother was reluctantly won over to his view.

Joe’s chance was not long in coming. That[14]
last great game he pitched for Yale had been seen
by Jimmie Mack, manager of the Pittston team of
the Central League. He scented an acquisition
for his nine and made Joe an offer that was too
good to reject. His struggles and triumphs in
that league are told in the fourth volume of the
series called “Baseball Joe in the Central League;
Or, Making Good as a Professional Pitcher.”

But Joe’s ambition kept pace with his progress.
He was not satisfied to be merely a “minor
leaguer.” He dreamed of “making” one of the
“Big Leagues”&mdash;National or American, it did not
matter which&mdash;but he knew how hard it was for
a minor to break in. His delight can be imagined
then when he learned that he had been drafted
into the St. Louis club of the National League.
His stirring adventures in this new field are narrated
in the fifth volume of the series entitled:
“Baseball Joe in the Big League; Or, A Young
Pitcher’s Hardest Struggles.” Hard struggles indeed
they had proved to be, but the same determination
that had won for him so far carried him
triumphantly through these also, and he had had
the satisfaction of helping his team finish in the
first division. From a “second string” pitcher he
now stood among the first, and his name had become
well known all over the country.

He had been very tired when he came back to
the old home town to spend the winter, and the[15]
rest had never seemed more grateful to him. But
now he was expecting very soon the call of his
team to go with them to a southern training camp,
to prepare for the coming season, and for some
time past he had been faithfully training in the
Riverside gymnasium, where we found him when
this story opened.

He was a fast and seasoned runner&mdash;any one
in a big league has to be, or he would not last
long&mdash;but it seemed to him he had never run as
fast and hard as now when he was rushing toward
the lumber yard. He knew that what was to be
done had to be done quickly. And he shuddered,
as he thought of the helpless baby in the grasp of
a lunatic.

He had soon outdistanced his companions.
Now he was getting close to the lumber yard. It
was in an isolated section of the town, down near
the railroad tracks which ran alongside of it.
Here there were but few footmarks, and Joe
could easily make out the long prints of a man’s
feet pointing straight for the yard.

Another minute and Joe had entered the yard.
He wound his way in and out among the piles of
lumber, hoping at every turn to catch sight of the
madman.

Suddenly he heard a shout that came from
somewhere above him. He looked up and saw a
sight that seemed to turn his blood cold.

[16]

There, on an enormous pile of lumber that towered
thirty feet into the air, stood a man holding
a baby in his arms. He had caught sight of
Joe and hailed him as though he wanted to have
a talk with him. But just then a torrent of men,
young and old, who had followed Joe, poured into
the yard, and a yell went up as they saw the tall
figure outlined against the sky.

In that wild yell the madman scented danger.
He lifted his helpless burden high above his head.

“Keep back!” he shouted. “If you don’t I’ll
throw the baby on the railroad tracks!”



[17]




CHAPTER III
A CRACK SHOT


There was a cry of horror from the crowd.
To be hurled to the tracks from that height meant
instant death for the little one.

Several of the men had started to climb the lumber
pile, but when they heard the madman’s threat
they stopped instantly. The man above saw that
his words had taken effect and he laughed shrilly.
But he still held the baby high in the air.

For a moment there was a hush of fear and indecision.
Then Joe took command of the situation.
His baseball experience had taught him
to think quickly and act instantly.

“That’s all right,” he sang out to the crazy man.
“You can keep the baby if you want to. We just
want to have a quiet little talk with you.”

The madman hesitated, looked about a little
uncertainly, then slowly lowered the infant and
held it cradled in his arms.

“That’s right,” approved Joe heartily. “You
and I are the only sensible people here. These
lunatics down here were making such a noise that[18]
I couldn’t make you hear me. Now we can talk.”

“Ha, ha!” cried the lunatic, delighted at the
compliment. “You hit it right that time. The
whole world is mad except for you and me. And
I’m not so sure of you, either,” he modified, with
a gravity that would have been comical under any
other circumstances.

While he was speaking, Joe was giving quick
directions in a low voice to the men nearest him.

“Get the fellows to spread out on all sides of
the lumber pile,” he said to Ed Wilson. “You,
Tom,” he went on to Tom Davis, “go quietly out
on the tracks. Then if he does throw the baby
down, we’ll at least have a chance to catch it or
break its fall.”

The others slipped away like shadows and Joe
once more sought to engross the madman’s attention.

“Oh, but you must be sure of me,” he expostulated
in answer to what the lunatic had said.
“Just watch the signs I give you, and if you can
do the same that will prove that we both belong
to the same lodge.”

The disordered wits of the man above saw
something interesting in this, and he nodded
gravely.

Joe stretched out his left hand and made a
number of mysterious passes in the air, at the
same time closing and unclosing his fingers.

[19]

Then he stopped and the man extended his
left arm and went through the same motions as
nearly as he could.

“Good!” cried Joe, and the madman capered
about in childish pleasure at the commendation.

“Now, do this,” commanded Joe, and he went
through a similar lot of mummery with the right
hand.

The crazy man imitated him, but to do it he had
to change the baby from his right arm to the left,
and this gave Joe an inspiration.

“Now, here’s the hardest thing,” said Joe, as
he lifted both arms at once and made them revolve.
“If you can do this, I’ll know for sure that
you’re all right.”

The stranger started to lift both arms to imitate
Joe’s revolutions, but found himself encumbered
by the baby. He looked at Joe in a sheepish
way, as though for advice.

“Of course you’ll have to lay the baby down,”
said Joe, carelessly. “You can’t make the right
motions unless you do.”

The lunatic looked at him with a sudden glint
of suspicion in his eyes, but Joe was so apparently
indifferent that he slowly laid the baby down.

Joe’s heart was beating high now with excitement
as the critical moment approached that
would test the success of the plan that had suddenly
darted into his brain.

[20]

A number of the village boys had been building
a snow fort and having a mock battle in the
lumber yard that afternoon. The snow was very
wet and the snowballs that had been formed from
it had almost the consistency of stone. A number
of these “soakers” were still lying about and Joe
saw his chance.

“Sam,” he murmured in a low voice to Sam
Berry. “Make me three or four hard snowballs
about as big as a baseball. Don’t ask me why but
make them hard and quick.”

Sam asked no questions but worked frantically,
and soon stood alongside Joe with his hands behind
his back.

“All ready, Joe,” he whispered. “Just reach
out when the time comes and I’ll put one in your
hand.”

The time had nearly come. Joe’s manœuvering
had brought it about that the baby was out of the
madman’s hands. The last step remained to be
taken.

“That’s fine,” roared Joe, as the stranger, after
making both hands revolve in the air, was about
to pick up the baby. “Now, there’s just this one
thing more and if you can do that, it will prove
that you and I are brother members of the same
lodge.”

Joe placed both hands on top of his head and
began to revolve his body slowly so as to present[21]
his back to the man above. In this position he
remained for about fifteen seconds.

“Can you do that?” he asked solemnly.

“Of course I can,” responded the other eagerly.
“Just watch.”

He slowly revolved until he stood with his
back toward Joe.

Now was the latter’s opportunity.

“Quick!” he muttered to Sam Berry.

Sam put in his hand a ball of snow that was
almost as solid as a stone. Joe’s fingers tightened
about it and his muscles grew taut.

Many a time before had he felt that queer
thrill go through his arm and shoulder as he stood
before some batsman in a critical period of the
game and tried to strike him out. But this time
much more than a game was at stake. A human
life depended upon the sureness of his aim.

He took careful aim at the back of the madman’s
head and sent the icy snowball whizzing as
though from a catapult.





HE SENT THE ICY SNOWBALL WHIZZING AS THOUGH FROM A
CATAPULT.


Straight as an arrow it found its mark. It
struck the stranger just at the base of the skull
and he went down like a bullock smitten by an
axe.

A wild cheer rose from the crowd as they saw
the man fall. The next minute Joe had swarmed
up the lumber pile with the agility of a monkey
and clasped the baby in his arms.

[22]

He was rapidly followed by others, who secured
the stranger. Ropes were called for, and
he was bound before he could recover consciousness.
A doctor who was in the crowd examined
him and found that he was suffering from shock
but that his skull had not been fractured and
there would be no serious results from the blow.

In the meantime, Joe was surrounded by a delirious
throng that clapped him on the back, tried
to grasp his hand, and in general deported itself
as though it had just escaped from an asylum.

“What’s the matter with Matson?” shouted
one enthusiast.

“He’s all right!” yelled the crowd.

“Who’s all right?”

“Joe Matson!” came back the shout in undiminished
volume.

“Oh, cut it out, fellows,” growled Joe good-naturedly,
feeling himself getting pink to the tips of
his ears. “The first thing to do is to get this baby
home to its mother.”

The baby seemed to think this was good sense,
and urged the good work along by howling so
lustily, that Joe quickened his steps in his eagerness
to be rid of his burden. It was all very
well to rescue babies, but he felt awkward and
helpless when it came to handling them and he
looked forward to the Bilkins home as a harbor
of refuge.

[23]

Fortunately, in snatching the baby out of the
cradle, the madman had gathered up the bedclothes
with it, so that the infant had not suffered
from cold. Its lungs anyway were in good
condition, as Joe was willing to testify, and it did
not seem to have suffered in any way from its involuntary
flight through the town.

It was not long before Joe reached the panic-stricken
home where neighbors were ministering
to the frantic mother and assuring her with a brave
show of confidence that her baby would soon be
restored. She gave a scream of delight when Joe
appeared with the little pink, fluffy bundle in his
arms, and in a moment she had snatched it from
him and was smothering it with kisses.

This was Joe’s chance and he was trying to
make a “quick sneak,” as he phrased it in his own
mind, but Bilkins himself and the crowd of neighbors
would stand for nothing of the kind, and
again he had to submit to being made a hero of,
much against his will.

“It was nothing at all,” he protested, blushing
like a school girl at the praises showered upon
him. “Any other fellow could have done the
same.”

“But you notice that none of the other fellows
did do it,” said Bilkins. “It was not only the sure
and swift aim that did it, but the clever work before
that that enabled you to get the baby out of[24]
the man’s arms and get the man himself with his
back toward you so that he could not see the ball
coming and dodge. It was splendid, brainy work,
Joe, and I’ll never forget it.”

It was a long time before the excitement quieted
down and Joe at last was at liberty to wend his
way home. The dusk was falling now and the
air was biting cold, but he was in such a glow of
body and spirit that he took no note of outside
conditions.

A great emergency had suddenly confronted
him and he had played the man.



[25]




CHAPTER IV
THE TELEGRAM


A flood of light and warmth assailed Joe as
he hung up his hat and coat in the hall and burst
into the living room.

“Hello, Momsey!” he cried buoyantly as he
crossed the room and kissed his mother. “Hello,
Sis!” as he turned to greet in a similar fashion his
sister Clara. “How are you, Dad?” and he smiled
affectionately at his father, who was sitting by the
fire pretending to read his paper, but in reality
swelling with pride in this stalwart son who was
the apple of his eye.

“Oh, Joe!” exclaimed his mother, happy tears
welling up in her eyes as she looked upon him
fondly. “I’m so proud of you that I don’t know
what to do or say.”

“Why, what have I been doing now?” asked
Joe in pretended ignorance of what she meant.

“Isn’t the dear boy innocent?” laughed Clara, a
pretty, winsome girl, as she slipped her arm about
her brother. “Of course, he doesn’t know what
we mean. He hasn’t set the whole town talking.[26]
He didn’t save a baby from a madman. He never
knew that there was anything unusual going on in
town this afternoon at all,” she mocked.

“Oh,” said Joe, “you mean the matter of the
Bilkins baby.”

“Yes,” mimicked Clara, “we mean the matter
of the Bilkins baby.”

They all laughed and Joe confessed. They
plied him with all sorts of questions and though
he sought to minimize what he had done, they
succeeded in getting a very fair idea of the almost
tragic scene that had been enacted.

“You’re awfully stingy with your information,”
said Clara, tossing her head. “Half a dozen of
the neighbors have been in and told us all about
what your high mightiness did. To hear them
talk, I’ve got a brother with the brain of a Socrates
and the arm of a Hercules. I’ll almost be
afraid to speak to you after this without knocking
my head against the floor first.”

“Oh, cut it out, Sis,” laughed Joe, a little sheepishly.
“You’re making an awful lot out of a very
little. I just had the luck to be Johnny-on-the-spot,
and I knew how to throw a snowball so that
it would do the most good.”

“It was a splendid bit of work, Joe,” said Mr.
Matson quietly, and Joe felt his heart warm; for
praise from this grave, thoughtful father of his
was very dear to him.

[27]

“I hope the man wasn’t very badly hurt,” said
Mrs. Matson, her feeling of pity for the “under
dog” asserting itself, now that her maternal pride
had been satisfied.

“I don’t think he is,” remarked Joe. “Doctor
Allison examined him and said that there were
no bones broken. He’ll come around all right,
although his head is liable to ache for some time.”

“Does anybody know who he is?” inquired Mr.
Matson.

“He seems to be a stranger in town,” answered
Joe. “I heard some one say that he had been
staying at the Park Hotel. I never saw him in
my life before.”

“What on earth did he want to take the Bilkins
baby for?” asked Clara. “Did he have any
grudge against the Bilkinses?”

“No, Bilkins told me that he was an entire
stranger to him and his wife. He looked at him
when they brought him back to town unconscious,
and she had caught a glimpse of him when he
snatched the baby from the cradle. Neither knew
him at all. It must have been just some crazy
whim that came into his twisted brain.”

“Poor little lamb,” murmured Mrs. Matson,
softly. “It must have been frightened to death.”

“Not a bit of it,” maintained Joe. “It didn’t
make a whimper all the time he was holding it.
But the minute I grabbed it, it began to yell like[28]
mad. Seemed to think that I was butting in on
its fun. There’s gratitude for you,” he ended
with a chuckle.

“I suppose you held the poor little thing upside
down or something like that,” said Clara, indignantly.
“You men are so clumsy when it comes
to handling a baby.”

While they had been talking, Mrs. Matson
had brought in the supper, and at sight of it Joe
forgot the laughing retort he was about to hurl
at his sister.

“Yum-yum!” he sniffed, as he seated himself at
the steaming, savory repast. “I give you fair
warning, Momsey, that I’m going to make a wreck
of this table.”

“Go as far as you like,” beamed his mother.
“The best in the house isn’t any too good for my
boy tonight.”

Joe “waded in” to make good his threat, and
for a time the conversation was rather fragmentary,
as he devoted himself to the delights afforded
by a good meal and a healthy appetite.

“Now bring on your crazy men,” he laughed,
as he sat back after dessert. “If I could knock
out one of them before supper I’m good for half
a dozen now.”

Mr. Matson smiled as he lighted his pipe, and
Mrs. Matson brought out her mending, while
Clara busied herself in clearing the table.

[29]

“How about my being a minister now, Momsey?”
asked Joe with a mischievous twinkle in his
eye. “Do you suppose a minister would have
been as useful at the lumber yard this afternoon
as a professional ball player?”

His mother bit off a thread before replying.
It had always been a sore point with her that Joe
had abandoned the plan of studying for the ministry.
She had become somewhat reconciled to
the idea by the success that Joe had won and the
fact, as shown in his own life, that he could be
a ball player and at the same time an upright,
moral man. And she had to confess that the
large salary that Joe earned by his skill had
helped his father out on critical occasions and
kept the little household together.

“Well,” she admitted, half reluctantly, “I suppose
you did do more good this afternoon because
you were so good at throwing the ball. And yet
you might be a minister and still be a good enough
ball player to have done what you did today.”

“I hardly think so,” laughed Joe. “But that’s
right, Momsey, stick to your guns. But what’s
this?” he asked, as he saw a telegram on the mantel
piece.

“Oh, yes, I meant to tell you,” Mrs. Matson
hastened to say. “That came for you this afternoon
just before dark. I was so flustered by all
that had happened it went clear out of my head.[30]
Open it and let’s see what it is. I hope there’s
no bad news in it.”

Joe tore open the flimsy yellow envelope and
his eye ran rapidly over its contents.

“Why, it’s from Reggie!” he cried, “and it’s
dated from Goldsboro, North Carolina.”

“From Reggie!” cried Clara with a glint of
mischief in her eye. “Are you sure that it isn’t
from Mabel?”

Joe withered her with a look.

“No, it isn’t from Mabel,” he answered, vexed
at himself because of the red flush he could feel
creeping up his face. “It’s from Reggie.”

“All right,” laughed Clara. “But what are you
getting so red about, Joe? What does Reggie
have to say?”

“It seems rather queer,” said Joe, slowly.
“This is the way it reads: ‘Am coming on. See
if you can find Talham Tabbs. Have him held.’
Now what do you make of that?”

“Who is Talham Tabbs?” asked Clara, coming
closer and looking over his shoulder.

“That’s the funny part of it,” replied her
brother. “Talham Tabbs is the name of the man
I knocked stiff on the lumber pile this afternoon.”

An exclamation of surprise came from each
member of the family group. Even Mr. Matson
was stirred out of his usual reserve by the singular
coincidence.

[31]

“How do you know that?” asked his father.

“Sam Berry said that that was the name the
man registered under at the hotel,” was the answer.

“But what possible connection can there be between
Reggie Varley and this crazy man?” mused
Clara.

“That’s what I’d like to know,” replied her
brother. “That’s the aggravating thing about a
telegram. It tells just enough to get you worked
up and then you stew in your own juice while
you’re waiting to find out the rest.”

“It looks as though this Tabbs had committed
some crime,” suggested Mr. Matson. “Else why
should Reggie ask to have him held?”

“That doesn’t prove very much,” laughed Joe.
“Reggie sometimes takes queer notions. There
was a time once when he had half a mind to have
me held.”

The family all laughed as they recalled the episode
alluded to, but at the time it had proved no
laughing matter.

It had occurred at the time that Joe had been
on his way to the training camp at Montville in
the year that our hero had joined the Central
League. He had been sitting next to the valise
owned by a dudish young man dressed in the height
of fashion and possessed of what he fondly
thought was a pronounced English accent. The[32]
young man had left the valise while he went to
send a telegram and when he returned he found
the valise opened and some valuable jewelry missing.

In a very offensive way he had practically accused
Joe of stealing the property, and it was only
the self-control of the latter that prevented a
serious row between the two. The matter had
been patched up, and some time later the jewelry
had been recovered through a little bit of smart
detective work on Joe’s part.

Montville, the training grounds of the team,
was located not far from where Reggie Varley,
the foppish young man in question, lived. One
day Joe had been fortunate enough to stop a runaway
horse and save its driver, a beautiful girl,
from danger and probable death. She turned out
to be Mabel Varley, Reggie’s sister. Joe decided
very promptly that however he felt toward the
brother, he ought to feel very differently toward
the sister, a resolution that was helped very much
by a pair of charming brown eyes, a wonderful
complexion and sundry other advantages no less
pleasing. Miss Mabel, on her part, knew a handsome,
athletic young man when she saw one, and
the romantic circumstances of their meeting helped
to increase the impression he had made on her.
Since then, they had met frequently and&mdash;Oh,
well, it is sufficient to say that Joe, healthy as he[33]
looked, was threatened with palpitation of the
heart whenever he heard Mabel’s name, and it
had become one of Clara’s favorite amusements
to start the color rioting over her brother’s neck
and face whenever the demon of mischief gave
her the opportunity.

Reggie himself had turned out to be not such
a bad fellow, despite his little foolish peculiarities.
He had apologized handsomely to Joe and the two
were now warm friends.

“Have him held,” chuckled Joe, as he reread
the telegram. “Well, that’s an easy job. The
jail authorities have him now and I won’t have
to hold him.”



[34]




CHAPTER V
AT THE JAIL


The rest of the evening following such an
eventful day passed pleasantly. Joe had usually
been in the habit of strolling down town for a
chat with his friends at the hotel. But he knew
that the whole town would be buzzing with the
exciting adventure of the afternoon and that, if
he made his appearance, he would be dragged into
the center of the limelight. He shrank from the
hero worship likely to be called forth and decided
to remain in the home circle.

But he could not wholly cheat the village people
of a chance to show their enthusiasm, and all
that evening friends came trooping in, to rehearse
the story of his exploit, so that it was very late
when he finally was able to get to bed.

He rose early the following morning and after
a hearty breakfast took his hat and left the house.
At almost every step he had to stop and talk to
some one who hailed him, so that it was considerably
later when he stood in the lobby of the Park
Hotel.

[35]

“By jiminy! that was a crack shot you made yesterday,
Joe,” said Sol Cramer, the proprietor.

“It had to be,” laughed Joe. “If I hadn’t
winged him that first time, I wouldn’t have had
another chance. He’d have got suspicious and
thrown the baby down on the tracks.”

“Was that what you call your ‘bean ball,’ Joe?”
drawled Ed Wilson.

“I suppose you might call it that,” answered
Joe with a grin. “It certainly ‘beaned’ him all
right. I’ve had to send them in pretty close sometimes
to keep some fresh batter from crowding
the plate, but this is the first time I ever hit a
man in the head. By the way, how is he getting
on today? It isn’t the poor fellow’s fault that he’s
crazy and I’m awfully sorry that I had to hit him
at all. I hope he’ll soon be as well as ever.”

“Oh, I don’t think you need to worry about it,”
returned Sol. “Doctor Allison has been down to
the jail to see him, and though there’s a lump on
the man’s head as big as an egg, the doc says it’s
nothing serious.”

“How long has he been staying here?” asked
Joe.

“Nearly a week,” replied Sol. “It would be a
week tonight if he’d stayed.”

“And hadn’t you noticed anything that might
make you think he was off his head?” queried
Joe.

[36]

“Not the least thing,” was the answer. “He
was as quiet and well behaved as any man could
be. He kept a good deal to himself and didn’t
seem to know any one in town, so that I wondered
sometimes just what his idea was in coming here.
But that’s none of my business as long as he pays
his bills, and I didn’t have any complaint on that
score. Paid me a week in advance as soon as
he had planked down his grip and registered.
Paid it from a big roll of bills, too, so that it
probably wasn’t money worry that made him go
mad. I thought he might be one of them literary
fellows that come to a quiet town sometimes to
write a book.”

“And you’re sure his name is Talham Tabbs?”

“That’s the name he registered by,” answered
Sol, at the same time turning the hotel register
around so that the group could plainly see the
name written in a firm business hand. “Then too,
his laundry has the initials T. T., and the same
letters are on his valise. I guess that’s his handle
all right.”

“You ought to know his name, Joe,” jibed
Tom Davis. “You’re both members of the same
secret society.”

There was a roar of laughter as they recalled
the ridiculous signs that Joe had made and the
gravity with which the madman had imitated
them.

[37]

“I’d hate to have Joe initiate me into his lodge,”
said Sam Berry. “I only have one head and I
need it in my business.”

“Same here,” chuckled Ed Wilson. “I believe
in the strenuous life, but Joe’s methods can hardly
be called ladylike. Almost rough, you might say.”

“It was too bad,” said Joe, half remorsefully.
“I hated to do it, but it seemed the only way, and
it was a matter of life and death.”

“You needn’t have any qualms of conscience
about it,” said Sol. “It was the finest thing that
has been done in this old town for many a moon,
and it’ll be a long time before people get through
talking about it.”

“If you hadn’t done it, there would probably
be crepe on the Bilkins doorbell this morning,”
added Sam. “I tell you it made my blood run
cold when he swung the baby in the air. I thought
it was a goner sure.”

“‘All’s well that ends well,’” quoted Joe,
lightly. “I think I’ll run down to the jail and take
a look at this Talham Tabbs. I may get some
inkling of what he had in mind when he kidnapped
the baby.”

“You have a swell chance of getting anything
from that chap,” said Ed Wilson, skeptically.
“But perhaps it won’t do any harm to try.”

Joe said goodby to his companions and sauntered
down to the jail, which was located on the[38]
southeast edge of the town. A few minutes’ walk
brought him within sight of it.

It was not an impressive structure. In the little
town of Riverside crimes were few and far
between. The chief function of the jail was to
take charge of wandering hoboes and to house
some participant in a brawl such as took place
from time to time between the laborers at the Harvester
works. Once in a great while, something
more important was charged against some reluctant
dweller in the jail, and on such occasions
there was more than ordinary stir within its
sleepy precincts.

It was a small two-story building. The upper
part was set apart as living quarters for the warden
and his family. On the lower floor, there
were a number of cells, and a large room in which
the occupants of the jail were allowed to gather
at stated periods for meals and recreation. In
addition, there was a room set aside as a hospital
room or infirmary for prisoners who might be ill
or disabled, and it was in this that Joe expected
to find the victim of his shot the day before.

He was admitted by Hank Bailey, the warden,
who shook his hand warmly and repeated the congratulations
that Joe was getting tired of hearing.

Hank was a stout, rubicund person and quite
advanced in years. He had gained his position
not because of any special fitness, but as a henchman[39]
of the political party that at that time ruled
the county. He was slow and easy going and
would have been utterly out of place in a larger
jail, where strict supervision and discipline were
demanded. But in this sleepy little jail he fitted
in well enough, and, as he was good-natured and a
general favorite in town, there were no special
complaints against his administration.

“Well, Hank,” said Joe, after greetings had
been exchanged. “I suppose you know pretty well
whom I’ve come to see.”

“Sure thing,” replied Hank. “You want to see
the lunatic that you brought off his perch yesterday
in the lumber yard. He’s in the hospital room
now by the doctor’s orders. Come along and I’ll
let you take a squint at him.”

“How does he seem to be today?” asked Joe,
as he followed his conductor through the corridor
on the lower floor of the jail.

“Oh, he’s doing well enough,” responded Hank.
“Doc Allison was here this morning and said he’d
be as good as ever in a day or two. Said though
that if that snowball had hit him a fraction of
an inch nearer the left ear his skull would have
been fractured sure.”

“Does he seem to be in his right mind?” asked
Joe, as the warden fitted the key into the lock.

“Sometimes he does,” replied his guide, “and
then again he doesn’t. The doc kind o’ sounded[40]
him as to his doin’s yesterday, but he either didn’t
recollect or he was shammin’, one or the other.
But you can see him now and judge for yourself.”

The jailer passed in and Joe followed.

On a bed in the further corner of the room, Talham
Tabbs was lying. It was the first time that
Joe had had a chance to examine his face closely
and he embraced the opportunity.

It was by no means an unpleasant face nor did
it bear any marks of criminality. It was long
and lean, but the features were good. If Joe had
passed him on the street and noticed him at all,
he would have set him down as a keen business
or professional man. The only thing at all queer
or abnormal were his eyes, that, as he turned them
on his visitors, glowed beneath his eyebrows like
twin coals.

His glance passed indifferently over the warden,
but when he caught sight of Joe there was a flash
of recognition. And what surprised Joe was that
the recognition was a friendly one. There was
no glint of malice or revenge. It was clear that
he did not know that it was Joe’s hand that had
brought about his downfall, and again Joe had
that half remorseful twinge that bothered him
before, although his common sense told him he
had acted rightly.

This feeling was intensified when Tabbs favored
him with a solemn wink and then raised his[41]
left hand and twiddled the fingers as Joe had done
yesterday. Joe was stumped for a minute, but
quickly recovered himself and returned the signal.
Then Tabbs went through the same flummery
with his right hand, then with both hands,
and would have concluded the ritual by turning
his back to Joe, if the attempt to do so had not
revealed that he was strapped to the bed.

Hank Bailey all this time had looked on with
growing bewilderment.

“What does all this monkey business mean?”
he demanded, helplessly.

Joe nudged him with his foot.

“It’s all right,” he affirmed. “Mr. Tabbs is
a member of the same lodge with me, and because
we are brothers he’s going to tell me all about
what happened yesterday.”

A doubtful look came into Tabbs’ face.

“How can I with him here,” he asked, pointing
to the warden. “He isn’t a member, and he
might give away our secrets if we talked them
over before him.”

“That’s right,” agreed Joe with another nudge
at Hank. “Please step outside, Mr. Warden,
while Brother Tabbs and I confer.”

Hank, although still bewildered, complied.

“Now,” said Joe, turning to Tabbs and speaking
with impressiveness, “I conjure you by the
great Te-To-Tum to answer me truly.”

[42]

Tabbs’ face became as grave as an owl’s. It
was evident that he took a childish delight in this
solemn nonsense.

“Speak, brother,” he said, “and I will answer
truly.”

“It is well,” said Joe. “Do you know a man
named Bilkins?”

Tabbs’ face was blank.

“No,” he answered. “Never heard the name
before.”

“Why did you take his baby yesterday?” continued
Joe.

“Was that his baby?” the prisoner asked. “I
just took it for a lark. The baby needed exercise
and so did I.”

Joe thought to himself that what the baby needed
might well be left to the judgment of its mother,
but he continued:

“Do you know a man named Varley?”

A cunning look came into the prisoner’s eyes
and he no longer looked straight at Joe, as he
answered evasively:

“I’ve known several people by that name in my
time.”

“This man was Reginald Varley, and he lives
at Goldsboro, North Carolina,” Joe went on, relentlessly.

“No,” snapped Tabbs. “Never met him.”

Joe felt sure that the man was not telling the[43]
truth, but he was getting so restless and angry
under his questioning that Joe felt it was useless
just then to pursue the matter further.

“All right, brother,” he concluded, as he rose
to go. “I’ll see you later.”

“Perhaps,” said Tabbs, and it was not till afterwards
that Joe sensed the meaning that lay behind
that final word of Talham Tabbs.

He rejoined Hank Bailey, who was waiting in
the corridor.

“Well,” that worthy greeted him, “did you get
anything out of him?”

“Not so you could notice it,” replied Joe.
“There isn’t much nourishment in talking to a
madman.”

“By the way, Hank,” he went on, as they
walked toward the street entrance, “there’s no
chance of any one breaking out of here, I suppose?”

“Leave that to me,” answered Hank, swelling
with a sense of his importance. “Nobody ain’t
ever broke out of this jail yet, and by crikey, they
won’t, as long as I’m the keeper!”



[44]




CHAPTER VI
GLORIOUS NEWS


When Joe said goodby to Hank Bailey it was
nearly noon, and as his way led past the Bilkins
home he met Bilkins himself hurrying home from
the Harvester Works for lunch.

The latter grasped Joe’s hand and almost
wrung it from its socket.

“The more I think of what you did yesterday,
the more grateful I am,” he declared. “We were
all so worked up that I didn’t thank you half as
much as I ought to have done. But I’ve been
thinking of it every moment since, and so has my
wife.”

“How is she, after the strain of yesterday?”
asked Joe, hoping to change the subject from his
own exploits.

“She’s all right,” replied the young husband.
“Of course, she’s a little shaky and weepy yet, but
that’s not to be wondered at when you think of
what she went through. But here we are right at
the gate. Come in for a minute.”

Joe would gladly have pleaded an excuse but[45]
hardly saw how he could, and he followed Bilkins
into the neat little living room of the cottage.

Mrs. Bilkins hurried forward to meet him.

“Oh, Joe!” she exclaimed, as she clasped his
hand, “I’ve been hoping to get this chance of
thanking you for what you did for us yesterday.
I was so excited at getting my baby back that I
couldn’t think of anything else at the time. But I
realize that if it hadn’t been for your quickness
and presence of mind I wouldn’t have any baby
now.”

She was perilously close to tears, and Joe, who
had the masculine dread of a scene, sought to introduce
a lighter note.

“The baby himself didn’t seem glad,” he laughed.
“The little rascal thought he was out for a
grand spree, and he was as good as a kitten while
the lunatic had hold of him. But the minute I
grabbed him he started in to howl like all possessed.
He didn’t like the idea of my breaking
up his fun.”

This broke the tension and they all laughed,
while Mrs. Bilkins snatched up a fluffy little bunch
from the cradle and showed him to his deliverer.
The baby cooed and gurgled and stretched out his
arms to Joe, who chucked him under the chin.

“Don’t try to come it over me, you young rascal,”
he said sternly, but the baby only cooed the
more and grabbed at his watch chain.

[46]

“It’s too bad he’s christened already,” smiled
Mrs. Bilkins. “If he hadn’t been, we’d name him
Joe.”

“What would be the use of putting a hoodoo on
the little chap,” protested Joe.

There was a little further conversation and
then, although they urged Joe to stay to lunch, he
excused himself on the plea that his mother would
be waiting for him and started for home.

But his progress homeward was doomed to be
slow that day, for he had scarcely gone a block
when he was hailed by Dick Talbot, the moving
picture operator whom he had had in mind the day
before while talking to Professor Crabbe.

“Hello, Joe, old man!” cried Dick, clapping
him on the shoulder. “I haven’t seen you for a
month of Sundays. How’s tricks?”

Joe returned his greeting with equal warmth,
for he had a strong feeling of friendship for that
exuberant youth who seemed always to be in good
spirits.

“Things are moving all right,” he answered.

“Anything doing in this old burg?” asked Dick.

“Oh, not so much,” was the answer. “You
know it’s rather a sleepy old town.”

“Sure thing,” said Dick with a twinkle in his
eye. “Nothing doing at all, except chasing crazy
men and saving kidnapped babies and little things
like that. Oh, yes, it was sleepy yesterday.”

[47]

Joe laughed good-naturedly.

“Trust you to get next to anything that happens,”
he said. “You’ve got the nose of a fox for
news. Who’s been filling you up?”

“Who hasn’t?” replied Dick with a chuckle.
“The whole town is talking of nothing else. They
say that a prophet is not without honor save in
his own country, but that doesn’t fit your case.
You’re the whole thing in Riverside.

“But say, Joe,” Dick went on jokingly, “why
didn’t you wait to pull this thing off till I reached
town with my little camera. My, what a scene
for a moving picture! I’d have given my eyes to
have a crack at it. Wild-eyed madman, holding
baby above his head; frightened mob in the yard
below; handsome young pitcher hurling the ball
of ice. Say, I could have made a fortune with
that film. All of the managers would have been
crazy to get hold of it.”

“Oh, cut it out,” remonstrated Joe. “The
whole bunch of you are making far too much out
of it. As for your moving picture stuff, I’ve got
something for you along that line that I’d like to
try out if you don’t mind.”

“Of course I will,” answered Dick. “Get it off
your chest. What is it?”

“I want you to take a picture of my curve ball,”
answered Joe.

“It’s a pretty swift thing to take,” commented[48]
Dick. “Still, if we can show a bullet in motion, I
guess we can take anything propelled by the
brawny arm of Mr. Matson.”

“There’s a professor in town,” explained Joe,
“who says it isn’t possible to pitch a curve.”

“Shades of Arthur Cummings and Bobby
Mathews!” groaned Dick. “Are there such fossils
still left in the world? Hasn’t the old chap
ever been to a baseball game?”

“I suppose he has,” smiled Joe. “Anyway, he
saw me curve some balls yesterday. He admits
that it seems to curve, but tells me that it is only
an optical delusion.”

“Listen to that!” exclaimed Dick. “Optical
delusion! If that’s so, about ten million fans in
this country have trouble with their eyesight and
ought to see an oculist. Your professor reminds
me of the wise Englishman who wrote a book to
prove it impossible for a steamer to cross the Atlantic,
and the very first boat that crossed brought
his book to this country.”

“Of course,” smiled Joe, “you and I know that
he’s wrong. But how are we to prove it to him?”

Dick thought hard for a minute or two. He
had had to do all sorts of things in the exercise
of his profession, and this had developed his
natural ingenuity to the point where he was ready
to say with Napoleon that there was no such word
as “impossible.”

[49]

“I’ll tell you how I think we can fix it!” he exclaimed
at length. “We’ll put two bamboo poles
about ten feet apart and in a direct line between
you and the plate. Then you take your stand in
the box exactly in a line with both of them. Between
the two poles we’ll stretch a sheet of white
paper. You throw the ball so that it goes to the
right of the first pole then turns and breaks the
paper and comes out to the left of the second pole.
That will be proof positive that the ball has described
a curve, and no matter how obstinate the
professor is he’ll have to admit it.”

“Bully!” cried Joe. “That will do the trick all
right. When do you think you can do it?”

“Oh, almost any time,” answered Dick. “My
time is pretty well filled up for today or tomorrow,
but if you’ll have the thing rigged up by day
after tomorrow, I’ll come over to the gymnasium
and take the picture.”

“Fine,” said Joe. “That’ll suit me to a dot.
Suppose we say two o’clock in the afternoon day
after tomorrow.”

“I’ll be there with bells on,” declared Dick;
and with a final handclasp they separated, and Joe
hurried home to his belated dinner.

“Sorry to have kept you waiting, Momsey,” he
said to his mother as he kissed her in the hall and
hung his hat and coat on the rack, “but it seems to
me that I’ve met the whole population of Riverside[50]
this morning. I didn’t know the old town
had so many people in it.”

“I don’t wonder they wanted to talk to you,
after yesterday,” said Mrs. Matson, her bosom
swelling with maternal pride. “I thought it would
be that way, so I got dinner ready a little later
than usual. But come right in now while things
are hot.”

“That’s an invitation I never refuse,” said Joe
gaily, as with his arm around his mother’s waist
he went into the dining room. “Hello, what’s
this?” as his eye fell on a yellow envelope on the
mantelpiece.

“It’s a telegram that came for you about an
hour ago.”

“From Reggie again, probably,” said Joe, as
he tore it open. “Something he forgot to put into
the first one. If I keep on getting telegrams, it
may pay the company to put in a branch office at
the house here.”

He ran over the message and his face flushed.
Then he read it again as though he could not believe
his eyes. Then with a whoop he threw it
from him, and catching his mother about the
waist whirled her around the room in a wild war
dance.

She extricated herself at last, breathless and
scandalized.

“Joseph Matson!” she exclaimed, “what on[51]
earth is the matter with you? Have you gone
crazy?”

“Not a bit of it, Momsey,” exulted Joe,
“though it wouldn’t be surprising if I had. I’ve
been traded to the New York Giants!”



[52]




CHAPTER VII
GREAT EXPECTATIONS


If a thunderbolt had fallen it could hardly have
created more astonishment.

“What’s that?” cried Clara, who had come
into the room just in time to see the last of the
mad dance and hear a fragment of what Joe was
saying.

“The Giants, Sis!” exclaimed Joe. “The class
of the National League! I’m getting right to the
top of the ladder! I’m going to play with the
finest team in the biggest city on the most famous
grounds in the United States! How’s that for a
jump?”

“Oh, Joe, that’s splendid!” exclaimed his sister,
throwing her arms around his neck. “I’m so proud
of this big brother of mine!”

“Will it mean such an awful lot to you, Joe?”
asked his delighted mother, who could never get
quite clearly in her mind the working of the great
national game.

“I should say it would,” returned Joe. “It’s a
big advance in a hundred ways. It’s the thing that[53]
every player in the country dreams about. There
are men who would almost give their eyes to have
my chance. It’s getting into the blue-ribbon class.
It’s like riding in an automobile after you’ve had
to put up with a buggy. It’s like getting a speaking
part in a play after you’ve carried a spear as
one of the Roman populace. It’s like&mdash;&mdash;”

What heights of eloquence Joe would have
reached in his enthusiasm was checked at this moment
by the entrance of his father.

“What seems to be the special thing that’s turning
all you sensible people into lunatics?” he
laughed.

Clara flew to him.

“Oh, Dad!” she exclaimed, “it’s the greatest
thing that ever happened. Joe is going to be a
member of the New York Giants. He’s just got
a telegram telling him about it. Isn’t it glorious?”

Mr. Matson’s face lighted up. More than the
women folks he could understand all it was likely
to mean to his son.

He wrung Joe’s hand jubilantly.

“I congratulate you with all my heart, my boy,”
he said. “It’s a great step forward in your profession
and I know you’ll make good on your new
team. But how did the matter come about?
Didn’t you have any idea that it was in the wind?”

“Not the least in the world,” answered Joe.
“The thing’s been carried on so quietly that I[54]
haven’t seen it even hinted or whispered in the
papers. Of course, they don’t usually go about
those things with a brass band, because they’re
afraid some other manager may hear about it and
try to butt in on his own account. McRae, the
manager of the New Yorks, is as foxy as they
make them, and he doesn’t let the newspapers get
hold of anything till he’s ready to have them. To
think that he’s picked me out for his pitching
staff!” and Joe again displayed such alarming
symptoms of seizing his mother for another whirl
that she retreated behind the table.

“Come and eat your dinner, you silly boy,”
she smiled fondly. “I suppose you’ll have to do
such a simple thing as eating, even if you are going
to play on your wonderful New Yorks.”

“Just watch me if you have any doubt about it,”
replied Joe, as the happy family seated itself at
the table.

As can be imagined, there was only one topic
discussed and that was the striking change in Joe’s
fortunes and the new vista that was opening up
before him.

“Did you ever have any talk with McRae that
made you think he might like to have you on his
team?” asked his father, as Joe passed his plate
for a second helping.

“Not at all,” was the reply. “In the first place
I was just a ‘rookie’ last year, and the older men[55]
in the league rather stand aloof from the raw beginners.
They don’t encourage any familiarity.
Not but what McRae has spoken to me though,”
he grinned.

“Is that so?” asked his mother with interest.
“What did he say?”

“Oh, he stood on the side lines while I was
pitching against his team and tried to rattle me,”
laughed Joe. “He told me that I was rotten, that
I never could pitch, that I ought to go back to the
bushes, that I was going up in the air, that I
couldn’t see the plate with a telescope, and other
little things like that.”

“I think he was just horrid!” exclaimed Mrs.
Matson, bristling at the thought of the taunts
hurled at her offspring.

“Oh, I didn’t mind it a bit,” chuckled Joe. “It
was all in the game. He was simply trying to ride
me, to get my goat&mdash;&mdash;”

“Ride you? Get your goat?” repeated his mystified
mother.

“You blessed Momsey,” cried Joe. “What I
mean to say is that he was trying to get me so
excited that I couldn’t pitch well and then his
team would win the game. But it didn’t work,”
he ended grimly, as he thought of that memorable
day when he had pitched the St. Louis team to victory
and dragged the Giants’ colors in the dust.

“Now that I come to think of it though,” Joe[56]
went on, “I remember that the last time I was in
New York, I caught him eyeing me pretty sharply
while I was sitting on the bench. I didn’t think
anything of it at the time, as I was all wrapped
up in the game, but it may have been that he was
sizing me up with just this deal in mind.”

“Does the telegram tell you just whom or what
you’ve been traded for?” asked his father.

“No, that’s the exasperating thing about it,”
replied Joe. “It just says that I’ve been traded
to the Giants but it doesn’t give any details. I
don’t even know who sent it except that it comes
from some official of the club. I’m anxious to
know, not only from curiosity, but because there
may have been some money passed in addition to
a player, and in that case I may get a little slice of
it for myself.”

“Somehow, I don’t exactly like the use of the
word ‘traded,’” said Mrs. Matson, reflectively.
“It seems to leave your own wishes out of the
matter altogether. Of course, in this case you’re
pleased, but even if you weren’t you’d have to submit
to it just the same.”

“I feel a little the same way,” agreed Clara.
“It’s almost as though you were so much merchandise,
a sack of wheat, a ton of coal, or something
of that kind.”

“Of course, that is one of the unpleasant features
of the game,” admitted Joe. “But as a matter[57]
of fact, it can’t be helped. If every one were
left free to act entirely for himself, the big leagues
would go to pieces in less than no time. Players
would be jumping from one team to another every
week, and no manager would know what he had to
depend on. There’s such a tremendous amount of
money invested&mdash;you couldn’t buy out the Giant
club at this minute for less than two million dollars&mdash;that
the men at the head have to take some
means to protect themselves. Some of their methods
wouldn’t stand the test, perhaps, if they were
taken to court, but it would be a very foolish
player who would seek a court action. If the baseball
players are ‘slaves,’ as they sometimes like
to call themselves, they’re the most happy and well
paid slaves in the world, and there are lots that
would like to change places with them and wear
their chains.”

“Do you suppose you will get a bigger salary
than you had in St. Louis?” asked his father.

“It’s almost a sure thing that I shall,” replied
Joe, hopefully. “If I was worth three thousand
dollars a year to the Cardinals, even before I had
made good, I ought to get at least four thousand
or a little more to start with on the Giants.”

“Four thousand dollars!” exclaimed Mrs. Matson,
who was so used to the modest figures that
prevail in a small town that the amount seemed
almost a fortune.

[58]

“Not many ministers get as much as that, eh
Momsey?” joked Joe.

“And that isn’t all,” he went on without waiting
for an answer. “I’ve got a much better chance to
get into the World’s Series on the Giants than I
would have on the Cardinals. McRae has won
several pennants already and it’s getting to be a
habit with him.”

“Is that because he is a so much better manager
than those of the other teams?” asked Clara.

“Maybe not altogether,” answered Joe reflectively,
“though there’s no doubt he’s one of the
very best. He gets a salary of thirty thousand
dollars a year”&mdash;here Mrs. Matson gasped&mdash;“and
I guess he’s worth it. But he has some advantages
that other managers don’t have. In the
first place, there’s unlimited money behind him and
if he wants anything that can be bought he goes
after it regardless of price. Then too, New York
is the best paying town in the whole league, and
it’s to the interest of the other clubs to see that
the New York team is a good one so as to draw
the crowds. So that McRae’s attempt to
strengthen his team doesn’t meet with such stiff
opposition as some other manager’s might. But
the chief thing is that he’s allowed to run the team
without any interference by the owners of the
club. He hires or discharges just whom he likes,
and they never make a peep. In that way he can[59]
maintain discipline over his players, because they
know that whatever he says goes. Oh, he’s a great
manager all right, and I’m mighty glad to have a
chance of playing under him.”

“Suppose you do happen to get into the World’s
Series, will it mean much extra money?” asked
Clara.

“I should say it would,” answered her brother.
“After taking out ten per cent. of the receipts for
the first four games for the National Commission,
sixty per cent. of the balance goes to the winning
club and forty per cent. to the losers. That makes
anything from three to four thousand apiece for
every member of the winning team, and from two
to three thousand apiece for each member of the
losing team. It’s almost like getting another
year’s salary just for an extra week’s work.”

“Just that World’s Series money alone would be
enough to start a nice little home with and settle
down to housekeeping,” remarked Clara, with
a sly glance at her brother.

Joe laughed, a little sheepishly, and again a
flood of color swept over his neck and face.

“Never you mind about that,” he said loftily.
“Plenty of time to think what I’ll do with the
money after I get it, if I ever do. But at least I’ve
got a great deal better chance than I would have
had on the Cardinals. Not but what I hate to
leave the old bunch,” he added a little soberly.[60]
“I’ve had a mighty good time this last year, and
Watson has treated me white. Most of the others,
too, were good fellows, especially Rad Chase.
I wish he were going along with me.”

“The change is going to be a mighty good thing
financially,” said Mr. Matson. “But leaving out
the money end altogether, how do you figure that
it’s going to be such an advantage to change from
the St. Louis to the New Yorks?”

“Oh, in a heap of ways,” replied Joe. “For one
thing, I’ll be playing before bigger crowds, and
that’s always an inspiration to a pitcher. Then,
too, we’re pretty sure to be well up in the race
and fighting for the lead, instead of being down
in the ruck. You don’t know how much difference
that makes to a player. Instead of being in the
doleful dumps, he’s feeling as frisky and gay as
a two year old. But the most important thing of
all is that with a good club he has smart, snappy
fielding behind him, and that makes him feel that
he’d pitch his head off to win. With the Giants’
brilliant infield behind me, many a hard-hit ball
will be turned into an out where with a poorer
club it would go as a hit. That helps my percentage.
Oh, it will make all the difference in
the world. Just watch my record from now on,”
and Joe swelled out his chest, while Clara mockingly
knocked her head on the table to do him
reverence.

[61]

“Hail to the Giant!” she exclaimed. “Although
I don’t see that you’re any more gigantic than you
were before, except that perhaps your head has
swelled a little,” she added mischievously.

Joe laughed. Laughter came very easily to
him today. The world had never seemed so
bright to him. Life was decked out in rainbow
colors. To be young, to be healthy, to be successful
in his chosen calling&mdash;what else did he
have to ask for?

Just one thing, perhaps. And again he flushed,
as he recalled what his sister had said about “settling
down to housekeeping.”



[62]




CHAPTER VIII
THE COMING OF REGGIE


The happy conference had been so animated
and there had been so many things to talk about
that Joe gave a start when he glanced at his
watch.

“Great Scott!” he exclaimed. “I didn’t think
it was anywhere near so late as that. I’ll have to
get a move on, if I’m going to meet Reggie.”

“Do you think he’ll be here today?” asked
Mrs. Matson.

“There’s no telling what Reggie will do,”
laughed Joe. “He’s a law unto himself. All that
he said in his telegram was that he was coming
on. But it’s possible for him to get here this afternoon
and I have a hunch that he’ll be here by
the first train he could catch after he sent the
wire.”

“Of course he’ll stay with us while he’s in
town,” said his mother.

“You can be sure that Joe wouldn’t let Mabel’s
brother go to a hotel,” put in Clara, demurely.

Joe pretended not to hear.

[63]

“I’ve got some other things to do too,” he said,
as he rose from the table, “so I guess I’d better
be starting.”

“What other things?” asked Clara.

“First of all, I’ve got to get some bamboo poles
and rig up things for a moving picture stunt in the
gymnasium,” replied her brother. “I met Dick
Talbot this morning and he promised to come
over and take a film of my curve ball in a day or
two. Professor Crabbe is as hard to move as
the rock of Gibraltar, but I guess he’ll pull in his
horns after Dick and I show him a thing or two.”
And much to their amusement, he told them of
the controversy he had had with the doughty professor.

“Then too,” he went on, “I’ll have to practise
like the mischief now until I receive notice to
start for the training camp. A good deal depends
on first impressions, and I want to show McRae
that he hasn’t picked a lemon.”

“Oh, dear,” sighed Mrs. Matson, “I hate
to hear you talk of going away. I grudge every
day you’re away from Riverside.”

“Never mind, Momsey,” said Joe, cheerily, as
he kissed her. “It’ll be some time before I have
to go and, after I do, I’ll keep the mails working
overtime.”

He put on his hat and coat and started out,
walking as swiftly and lightly as though he trod[64]
on air. The atmosphere was crisp and bracing,
his blood coursed strongly through his veins, and
the world had never before seemed so good a place
to live in.

He turned his steps first toward the gymnasium.
He had found this place of the greatest value to
him through the winter season. He had not practised
so hard that there was danger of his going
“stale” before the actual beginning of the season,
but he had done just enough work to keep him in
superb physical condition and hold the flesh down.
There was scarcely an ounce of superfluous flesh
upon his bones and he felt as though he could go in
the box tomorrow if he were called upon. He
never dissipated&mdash;had never touched a drop of
liquor in his life&mdash;and one might have gone a
long way before finding a more perfect specimen
of the athlete than Joe presented that afternoon.

He found several of his chums awaiting his
coming, and of course the first thing he did was
to tell them of the great news that had come to
him that morning.

“The New York Giants!”

“Bully for Joe!”

“Some class to old Riverside, eh?”

“They’ll win the pennant sure, now!”

“You’ll have a look-in at the World’s Series,
Joe!”

They all crowded round with warm and hearty[65]
congratulations and wrung his hand until he
winced.

“Don’t take my arm off, boys,” he laughingly
protested. “I need the old soup bone in my business.”

“I wish I could tell you all about it, fellows,”
he went on, in reply to their eager request for particulars,
“but honestly, I don’t know any more
about it than you do yet. I suppose I’ll get a
contract to sign in a day or two, and perhaps
there’ll be something about it in the New York
papers when they get here tomorrow morning.
All I know now is that I’m going to play this
year in New York. That is,” he jested, “unless
McRae finds out he’s been buncoed and fires me.”

“Swell chance of anything like that!” exclaimed
Tom Davis. “I’ll bet you’ll take your regular
turn in the box from the very start.”

“I’m not so sure of that,” answered Joe. “McRae
puts a great deal of faith in his veterans, and
the chances are I’ll have to warm the bench until
some of the others fall down. You know how it
was with Markwith, the ‘eleven thousand dollar
beauty.’ McRae kept him on the bench for nearly
two years, scarcely using him at all, but giving him
a chance to learn the ‘inside stuff’ by watching the
others. Then when he was ripe, McRae put him
in and he went through the league like a prairie
fire. He may do the same thing with me.”

[66]

“Stuff and nonsense,” declared Tom, loyally.
“You’re as good a pitcher now as Markwith ever
dared to be. Besides Markwith came from a
minor league while you’ve already had a year’s
experience in the National League with St. Louis.”

“I’m afraid it’s your friendship rather than
your judgment that’s talking now, Tom,” answered
Joe. “Markwith has won nineteen
straight, right off the reel, and that’s some little
record, let me tell you. But I surely am going to
do my best, not only on my account but so as not
to disappoint my old friends. Take off your coat
now and I’ll toss you up a few just to get my wing
good and supple.”

Tom complied, and there was some spirited
pitching practice which demonstrated that Joe was
in fine fettle. All his curves worked finely, and
there was a world of speed behind the high fast
ball that he occasionally cut loose.

“I’m afraid I’ll have to stop now,” said Joe
reluctantly, after half an hour of good practice, as
he looked at his watch. “I’ve got to stop at
Brigg’s store to get a couple of bamboo poles, and
then I have to go down to the station to meet a
friend whom I rather expect by the four-thirty-five.
I’m sorry, too, for I’m just getting warmed
up and I’d like to keep going for an hour yet.”

He said goodby to his chums, and, after having
stopped in the store to make his purchases,[67]
strolled down to the railroad station, to await the
possible coming of Reggie. He was eager to find
out all the meaning of the queer message he had
received, and it is barely possible that he was still
more eager to have some tidings of Reggie’s sister.

He had to cool his heels in the depot for some
time, as the train was late, and it was fully an hour
after its usual time when it finally rolled into the
station.

There were several day coaches and but one
parlor car, and Joe made his way straight toward
this, knowing that Reggie, who looked for the best
in everything, would travel in no other.

In the first few who came down the steps he
noted no familiar figure, and he was beginning to
think that Reggie for some reason had deferred
his trip when he caught sight of that young man
coming leisurely from the Pullman. If he had
not seen the face he would have had a moral certainty
that it was Reggie, for he was dressed in
an extreme of style that was not at all common in
the quiet little town of Riverside.

Reggie was an amiable young man who could
not by any stretch of imagination be described as
an intellectual giant. Many in fact would have
had no hesitation in classing him as a “lightweight.”
But he had many qualities that redeemed
his foppishness, chief among which, in Joe’s estimation,
was that he was a rabid baseball “fan,”[68]
and above all was the brother of Mabel. This
last would alone have been capable, like charity,
of covering a multitude of sins.

He had a tiny little moustache curled up at the
ends that gushing girls would have described as
“darling,” his clothes were a suit of English
tweeds, and he had an accent and a vocabulary
that he made as English as possible.

“Hullo, old top!” he exclaimed, as he saw Joe.
“I’m awfully glad to see you, don’t you know. It
was no end good of you to come down to meet me,
especially as I hadn’t told you just when I was
coming.”

“That’s all right, Reggie,” smiled Joe, as he
grasped his hand cordially. “I knew you must
have been rather cut up when you sent that telegram
and forgot to tell me the train you were
taking. But it seems like old times to see you
again. How’s every one down at Goldsboro?”

“Fine as silk,” responded Reggie. “If I hadn’t
had to rush off in such a hurry, I’d have brought
Mabel along with me just for the trip. She’s awfully
anxious to see your sister, Clara, don’t you
know. It’s astonishing how those girls have taken
to each other.”

“Clara feels the same way,” responded Joe
warmly. “She’s done little else but talk of Mabel
since the last time she was here. But give me
your check, old man, and I’ll attend to your baggage.[69]
Of course you’ll stop with us while you are
here. That goes without saying.”

Reggie made a feeble protest as a matter of
form, saying that he ought to go to the hotel, but
he readily submitted to be overruled by Joe. The
latter tossed the check to the station hackman with
instructions to get Reggie’s valise, and when this
was done the two friends took the hack and were
whirled through the quiet streets to Joe’s home.

By tacit consent, neither spoke of the real object
of Reggie’s visit to Riverside just then. There
would be plenty of time for that when they should
be alone after supper and have nothing to interrupt
them.

“Beastly cold weather, what?” said Reggie, as
he turned up the collar of his overcoat.

“It is pretty sharp,” agreed Joe; “but nothing
to what it was the last time you were here. That
was a blizzard for fair. Remember how we were
all upset in the snow when we were trying to get
to town from the train stalled in a snowdrift?”

“I remember, all right,” laughed Reggie. “We
certainly had a fight for life that night.”

“And what a thoroughbred your sister was that
night,” continued Joe, who was always anxious to
bring the conversation round to Mabel. “Where
lots of girls would have gone into hysterics, she
was as cool and brave as any man could have
been.”

[70]

“Mabel has class,” agreed Reggie carelessly.
“I recall how she held the horses’ heads while we
were righting the sleigh. Some plucky girl!”

“You bet she is!” responded Joe, with an enthusiasm
that might have seemed suspicious to
Reggie if the latter had not been so wrapped up
in his own affairs that his talk with Joe was rather
absent-minded and made no strong impression on
him.

Joe was not long in discovering that Reggie’s
trouble, whatever it was, sat heavily on him.
He relapsed into monosyllables until the Matson
home was reached.

The hearty welcome he received from all the
members of the family thawed him out somewhat,
and during the meal that followed&mdash;a meal into
which Mrs. Matson had put all her housewifely
skill because of the expected guest&mdash;he was more
like the gay, care-free Reggie that they had previously
known.

He was especially delighted to know of the
change in Joe’s fortunes, and congratulated him
heartily on his transfer to New York.

“If you work for them as well as you worked
against them, there’ll be no kick coming on the
part of McRae,” he prophesied. “In that last
game you played in New York you had the Giants
eating out of your hand.”

“Let’s see,” said Joe, with affected carelessness,[71]
“your sister was with you that time, wasn’t she?”

“You’d think she was if you heard how many
times she’s referred to that game since then,” answered
the unsuspecting Reggie. “Mabel always
did like to see a good game, but this last year or
so, she’s become more of a fan than ever.”

Clara, glancing at her brother, felt that she
could make a shrewd guess why Mabel had developed
such an increased interest in baseball, but
the presence of Reggie put a spoke in her eager desire
to tease Joe for the fun of seeing him blush.

“You’re lucky to have the thing happen just
now, when the fans are beginning to get hungry
for baseball news,” commented Reggie. “The
newspapers will play up the deal for all that it is
worth, and your picture and record will be on
every big sporting page in the country.”

“Perhaps that won’t be an unmixed blessing,”
laughed Joe. “It’ll make the public expect too
much, and the disappointment will be all the
greater if I don’t make good.”

“I’ll take chances on that,” replied Reggie emphatically.
“There isn’t a better aim than yours
in the league, and the whole country will be ready
to admit it before the season is over.”

The talk ran on pleasantly for an hour or two
after the supper was over. Clara played and sang,
and Reggie dutifully turned her music for her and
made himself agreeable to Mrs. Matson. But[72]
all felt that Reggie had a revelation to make to
Joe, and as soon as courtesy would permit the
other members of the family said good night and
left the two young men to themselves.

There was a cozy open fire burning in the grate
and they drew up their easy chairs before its cheerful
glow, facing each other.

“Now, Reggie,” said Joe, with a quizzical
smile, “tell me the sad story of your life. Go to
it, old man. Tell me about Talham Tabbs.”



[73]




CHAPTER IX
A TRUSTING DISPOSITION


Reggie flushed and gave a little uneasy laugh.
For one who usually had a very good opinion of
himself, he seemed singularly embarrassed.

“The truth is, old top,” he said, “I scarcely
know where to begin. I’m afraid I’ve been a fool,
don’t you know.”

“Nonsense,” said Joe encouragingly. “We all
make mistakes. The fool is not the man who
makes a mistake but the one who makes the same
mistake twice. The perfectly wise man has never
yet been born. At least, if he has I’ve never met
him.”

“It’s awfully good of you to talk that way,”
replied Reggie, “and it makes it easier for me to
tell you what I’ve got to say. But before I go
any further, let me ask you one question: Have
you seen anything of that Talham Tabbs I mentioned
in my telegram?”

“Yes,” answered Joe nonchalantly. “I saw him
for the first time yesterday. Rather unexpected
meeting it was, too, for a fact.”

[74]

“Where did you see him?” asked Reggie
eagerly.

“On top of a lumber pile,” was the answer.

“On top of a lumber pile?” repeated his friend,
with a puzzled air. “What on earth was he doing
there?”

“Swinging a baby above his head and threatening
to throw it down on the railroad track,” replied
Joe.

Reggie stared blankly at Joe, as though he
thought he was suddenly bereft of reason.

“I never was good at riddles, old chap,” he
said. “Tell me just what you are driving at.”

And then Joe told him all the happenings of the
day before, while Reggie looked at him with
open-eyed wonder.

“And you brought him down with the first
shot,” he marveled. “That aim of yours is certainly
a pippin. McRae made no mistake when
he got you on his staff.”

“It was a case of touch and go,” remarked Joe.
“I simply had to get him on that first try. If I’d
missed him then, I’d never have had a chance for
a second shot.”

“I’m glad the poor beggar wasn’t badly hurt,”
said Reggie. “Are you sure that he’s perfectly
safe down in the jail?” he added as an afterthought.

“I don’t see where he could be much safer,” answered[75]
Joe. “Old Hank Bailey hasn’t any more
brains than the law allows, but I guess he’ll keep
him right and tight. Besides, he was strapped to
the bed when I saw him this morning. I gave
Hank a special tip to be on the watch, and I guess
we don’t have to worry about laying our hands on
him when we want him.”

“That’s good!” ejaculated Reggie, with a sigh
of relief. “I’m beginning to see daylight now.”

“Well, now,” said Joe, “that I’ve told you all I
know, suppose you loosen up and tell me just why
you’re so interested in the doings of Talham
Tabbs.”

“I will,” answered Reggie, “and you’ll be the
first living soul to know anything about it outside
of Tabbs and myself. I haven’t even told Mabel
about it, though she and I have been close pals
ever since we were children. And as for breathing
a word of it to the governor&mdash;&mdash;” Here Reggie
spread out his hands in a gesture that was more
eloquent than words.

Joe thought to himself that he could very readily
understand why Reggie might shrink from
revealing anything to the stern, gruff father, of
whom he had caught an occasional glimpse; but
when it came to the womanly sympathy of Mabel
it was different.

“You see,” went on Reggie, “I’ve been thinking
for some time that I ought to settle down&mdash;make[76]
something of myself&mdash;go into business of some
kind or other&mdash;what?”

Joe had privately long had a similar feeling
about Reggie. What he had seen of his friend had
shown him a young man who was seeking the
froth of life rather than the substance, chasing the
phantom of pleasure rather than facing the sober
realities of things as they are. Had he been any
one else than the brother of Mabel, Joe would
simply have classed him as a social butterfly and
let it go at that. As it was, he had excused a lot
of things because of his youth, and now he was
sincerely glad to learn that Reggie was taking a
more sensible view of life.

“That’s the way to look at it, old man,” he said
approvingly. “There’s nothing in this society
stuff.”

“So I went to the governor,” continued Reggie,
“and told him what I had in mind. The trouble
is, dad has been too good to me. Had a pretty
rough time of it when he was young&mdash;poverty,
hard work, and all that&mdash;and he had promised
himself that his son, if he ever had one, shouldn’t
have so hard a time of it as he had had. So he
gave me everything I wanted&mdash;plenty of money,
a tour of Europe, motor boat, automobile, and all
that sort of thing, don’t you know. I suppose
later on he expects to take me into business with
him, but he hasn’t been in any hurry about it.[77]
Funny, isn’t it, how hard-headed men look at those
things sometimes when their children are concerned?”

Joe nodded. He had known of more than one
instance where, through some strange blindness,
men who had risen to wealth by their own endeavors
had been unwilling that their boys should have
the same hard but wholesome experience.

“He laughed at me at first,” Reggie went on,
“and tried to joke the matter off. But when he
saw that I was in earnest it set him thinking. Then
he looked at me in that quizzical way of his and
said:

“‘I tell you what I’ll do, Son: I’m willing to
take a chance just to see what stuff there is in you.
Just as one throws a puppy into deep water so
that the pup will either have to swim or drown,
I’m going to throw you into financial waters and
give you a chance to make good or go under.’

“He went to his safe, twirled the combination,
and came back to me with a package. He ripped
off a rubber band, and I saw that the package was
a big bunch of securities.

“‘Now, Reggie, my boy,’ he said, ‘here’s where
you show me what there is in that noddle of yours.
These securities have a value of ten thousand dollars.
They’re bonds of the A. K. T. Railroad.
It’s one of the safest and best managed roads in
the country, and these are as good as government[78]
bonds. I’m going to put these absolutely in your
hands to do with precisely as you like. Turn them
into cash, pledge them, sell them, invest them&mdash;do
anything you want to with them. At the end of
a year come to me and tell me just what you’ve
done and just what profit you’ve made, if any,
from the use of them. In the meantime, I’ll give
you a free hand and won’t ask you a word about
them.

“‘Of course,’ he went on, ‘they’re a five-per cent.
bond, and you could make five hundred dollars
by merely clipping the interest coupons and
presenting them when they come due. But that
isn’t my idea. Any fool could use a pair of scissors.
What I want you to do is to use the money,
put it to work, mix it with brains, and at the end
of a year come to me and show me the results.’

“You can bet that I was well stumped. You
could have knocked me down with a feather.”

“I should say so!” ejaculated Joe, with a low
whistle. “Ten thousand dollars! That’s an awful
lot of money to have plumped down before you
and to be told that it’s all yours to do with exactly
as you like.”

“That’s what I told the governor as soon as I
could get my breath,” said Reggie. “But he only
laughed and said that he had earned it and that
what he did with it was no one’s business but his
own. The only condition was that I shouldn’t[79]
use it for anything except to make more. Said my
allowance would go on as usual, so that I wouldn’t
have to use any of the ten thousand for my living
expenses.”

“Great Scott, Reggie, that was a wonderful
chance for a young fellow!” cried Joe, who had
grown hugely interested in the story of this favorite
of fortune. “What have you done with the
ten thousand?”

“What have I done with it?” echoed Reggie
ruefully. “I gave it to Talham Tabbs.”

“What!” shouted Joe, jumping to his feet so
violently that he overturned his chair. “What’s
that you say?”

“I gave it to Talham Tabbs,” repeated Reggie,
averting his eyes from those of his friend as he
made the startling confession.

“But why&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;” stammered Joe blankly.

“Just to prove that an old proverb is true,” was
the answer.

“What proverb?”

“‘A fool and his money are soon parted,’” replied
Reggie bitterly.



[80]




CHAPTER X
REGGIE CONFESSES


Joe resumed his seat, too astounded to know
what to do or say under the circumstances.

“Beg pardon for being so brusque, old fellow,”
he remarked, “but really you took the ground from
under my feet. What on earth led you to give
your money to a man who is as mad as a March
hare?”

“I’ve asked myself that same question many
times since the thing happened,” answered Reggie
drearily, “and the only answer I can find is that I
must have been the more insane of the two.

“It’s only fair to say, though,” he went on, “that
at the time I ran across him there wasn’t a trace of
insanity about him. He seemed to me to be one
of the cleverest men I ever met. Others thought
so too, so perhaps I’m not so very much to blame
after all.”

“Where and when did you first meet him?”
asked Joe.

“At the Goldsboro Country Club,” answered
Reggie. “You know that our folks have membership[81]
there and I run out very often. I was out
there one day watching a tennis tournament when
this Tabbs came strolling along and spoke to me.
There seemed to be something familiar about his
face and yet I couldn’t quite place him until he
said he had met me one time at Morgan &amp; Company’s
in New York. Then I remembered him
perfectly. I had gone down to the city on a trip
with my father, and as he had business with the
Morgan people, he took me along with him.
Tabbs was holding an important position with the
firm at the time, and he seemed to take quite a
liking to me. Took me out to lunch with him and
then showed me around the city. That was two
or three years ago, and I hadn’t seen him since
until he came to me at the Country Club.

“Of course, it was up to me to give him as good
a time as I could, in return for what he had done
for me in New York, and I did. Introduced him
to lots of the best people in Goldsboro, took him
home with me and had him stay with me for a day
or two, and whizzed him about the country in my
automobile. To tell the truth, it wasn’t hard to
entertain him, for he was a bright and amusing
talker and seemed in every way to be an all-around
good fellow.”

“How did he happen to be so far away from
New York City and right in the busy season, too?”
asked Joe.

[82]

“That struck me as rather queer,” replied Reggie,
“but he explained by saying that he was on a
secret mission for his firm. Awfully mysterious
and all that, don’t you know. Of course, the more
mysterious he was the more curious I became. I
suppose he figured on that. Anyway, after a lot
of hinting and fencing about, he came right out
one day and said that he was going to take me into
his confidence, that I was too good a fellow to
leave on the outside when I might get in on the
ground floor, and a lot of rot like that, don’t you
know.”

“I know, all right,” said Joe, with a smile.
“I’ve had lots of tips about big things that were
going to be pulled off and been urged to get
aboard while there was time. Ball players are
known to get good salaries, and they’re deluged
with circulars and market tips of all kinds. But I
never yet tried to beat Wall Street at its own
game. You know what they say of it, that ‘it’s a
crooked street with a graveyard at one end of it
and a river at the other.’”

“I guess that description fits it, all right,”
agreed his friend, “but of course I thought that
Tabbs was different from an ordinary market tipster.
I had seen him holding down a big job with
Morgan &amp; Company, and I naturally thought he
had inside information.”

Joe had to admit that this was reasonable.

[83]

“He put me under a pledge of secrecy,” went on
Reggie, “and then he opened up. Said that Morgan
&amp; Company had a big scheme for combining
under one control all the electric light and power
companies of the State. Claimed that he already
had an agreement with the majority of them to
come into the deal. The thing was to be kept under
cover until everything was ripe, and then the
stock would double and treble in value, and the
lucky holders would make a fortune. Now was
the time to buy before the big news came out.”

“Old stuff,” thought Joe to himself, although he
did not give utterance to the thought for fear of
wounding Reggie, who was sore enough already.

“Of course,” went on Reggie, “the first thing I
thought of was the ten thousand in stocks that the
governor had put in my hands to show what I
could do. Here was the chance to make it twenty
or thirty thousand or more, if Tabbs was right.
And honest, Joe, that fellow could have convinced
anybody. He was the most persuasive talker I
ever met. Had facts and figures at his tongue’s
end and reeled them off by the thousand. Showed
me a chart of his own on which he had marked all
the market fluctuations on leading stocks for ten
years back. Had an answer for every objection.
He was a perfect encyclopedia on everything that
concerned stocks and bonds. If ever any man
knew his business, it was Talham Tabbs.”

[84]

And Joe, recalling the keen face of the madman,
could very well understand how Reggie would be
putty in his hands.

“The upshot of it all was,” blurted out the
dudish young man desperately, “that I put the
whole ten thousand in his hands to turn into cash
and invest for me in the securities of the different
light and power companies. He was to do this
quietly and secretly as he went from one place to
another, and then when he had invested it all he
was to turn them over to me to hold them for the
rise that would come as soon as the deal was concluded.

“I didn’t do this right off the reel. I felt skittish
about putting all my eggs in one basket. I
wanted to put in part of the money only, but he
laughed at me. Opportunity only came once to a
man, he said, especially such an opportunity as
that. I was dazzled by his figures, and when I
thought of the pleasure it would be to prove to my
father that I had more brains than he gave me
credit for and knew how to double and treble my
money in a few months, I gave in and went into
the thing, hook, line and sinker.”

“Too bad, old fellow,” consoled Joe, who was
moved to pity by the distress that showed in his
friend’s face. “What happened then?”

“He went away a few days later,” continued
Reggie. “Had to go to Raleigh, he said, to see[85]
some members of the legislature. He wrote to
me every few days and told me he was getting
along famously. Then his letters stopped. I
didn’t think so much of this at first, because I
knew he would be tremendously busy putting
through the deal. But when three weeks passed
without hearing from him I got uneasy. I wrote
to him to the address of Morgan &amp; Company,
thinking they would of course know his whereabouts
and forward his mail to him, and you can
imagine how I felt when I got my letter back
marked ‘Not here.’ I wrote then to the firm direct,
and asked about Talham Tabbs. They wrote
back promptly that Tabbs had once been employed
by them and that they had valued him as one of
their most competent men, but that a year before
he had gone suddenly insane and had to be committed
to an asylum. They gave me the name of
the asylum so that I could write there if I wished
to learn anything further about his condition, although
they had been informed that his case was
thought to be incurable.

“I tell you what, old man, that knocked me all
in a heap. My ten thousand dollars had been put
in the care of a crazy man, who, for all I knew,
had turned the securities into cash and by this
time might be in Canada, or Europe, or South
America, or any old place.”

“It must have been a knockout blow,” said Joe.

[86]

“For a little while I thought I would go crazy
myself,” continued Reggie. “I couldn’t eat or
sleep, and the folks saw there was something the
matter with me. Mabel was worried out of her
head, and tried to get me to tell her what was the
trouble.”

“Just like Mabel,” thought Joe to himself, conscious
of a sudden warmth in the region of his
heart.

“I think the governor rather suspected that
something had gone wrong in a money way,” continued
Reggie. “But he’s a thoroughbred, and
since he had said he wouldn’t ask me about it for
a year, he stuck to his promise.”

“Couldn’t you pick up any clue as to Tabbs’
whereabouts?” queried Joe.

“Not a thing for a long while,” was the answer.
“Of course, I was handicapped because I
had to keep everything under cover. The first
thing I did was to make a trip to the asylum where
he had been confined. The superintendent told me
that Tabbs had escaped about two months before.
Said he was one of the brightest and ablest men
that had ever been confined there. There would
be weeks at a time when he would appear to be as
sane as any man. Then he would have sudden fits
of violence come upon him, when they couldn’t
do anything with him and had to truss him up in a
strait-jacket to keep him from harming the other[87]
inmates. I suppose he must have had one of those
spells come on him when he carried off the baby.”

“I suppose so,” said Joe with a shudder, as the
thought of the narrow escape came up before him.

“The superintendent told me that they had been
hunting for him ever since he got away but hadn’t
got a trace of him. I told him then that I had
met him and that he was still going by his right
name. Naturally I didn’t tell him what a fool
Tabbs had made of me. He was delighted to get
the information I gave him and said that he would
follow up the clue at once. I didn’t rely wholly
on that, however, and on the quiet I put the matter
in the hands of a detective agency.”

“Did that help you out any?” asked Joe.

“Not a bit,” replied Reggie disgustedly. “All
they sent me was a bill for services rendered, although
they kept hinting that they were right on
his heels. They must have been a pretty nimble
pair of heels, though, because they always got
away. Don’t talk to me of detectives. ‘Defectives’
would be a better name for them.”

“How did you find out then that he might be at
Riverside?” asked Joe with lively curiosity.

“By the merest chance in the world,” replied
Reggie. “I was in Wilmington and when I went
to the hotel and started to register I turned over
the leaves to see if any of my friends were there
and caught sight of Tabbs’ name. Of course I[88]
made inquiries in a hurry, and the clerk told me
that he had left a week before. I went to the station
and found that a man answering to his description
had bought a ticket and had his baggage
checked through to Riverside. Then I sent the
telegram and followed it as soon as I could. Now
you know the whole story.”

“Well,” said Joe, drawing a long breath, “it’s
pretty bad, but it might have been worse. Now
that we have Tabbs where the dogs can’t bite him,
you have a chance to get your money back.”

“Yes,” agreed Reggie, “but after all it’s only a
chance. No knowing what he may have done with
it by this time.”

“Would he have had any trouble in turning the
securities into cash?” asked Joe.

“Not the least in the world,” was the answer.
“They are as easily handled almost as if they were
United States currency. The mere possession of
them is regarded as proof of ownership. He
could go to any bank or big brokerage house in
the country and turn them into cash at five minutes’
notice.”

“Well, even if he did, he may have all, or nearly
all, of the money left,” said Joe hopefully. “Sol
Cramer, the landlord at the hotel, said that he
had a big roll of bills when he paid for his week’s
board. He can’t spend any of it where he is now,
at any rate.”

[89]

They discussed the matter for an hour or more
and then Joe insisted that Reggie ought to get
to bed.

“You’ve had a long journey,” he remarked, as
he rose to show his friend to his room, “and you
need a good night’s rest so as to be fit when you
tackle Talham Tabbs in the morning.”



[90]




CHAPTER XI
A STARTLING DISCOVERY


It was bright and early the next morning when
the two friends sallied forth right after breakfast.
The air had a tang and sting to it that sent the
blood coursing swiftly through their veins, and the
delicious buckwheat cakes for which Mrs. Matson
was famous formed no small element in their general
sense of well-being.

“Now for Talham Tabbs!” exclaimed Reggie.
“I’ll bet he’ll be stumped at seeing me again. He
thinks I’m hundreds of miles from here, if he
thinks of me at all. I’m mighty curious to see how
he’ll carry things off.”

“He seems to be an artist at carrying things
off,” laughed Joe, with a sly poke in Reggie’s ribs.

“You’re right there,” grinned Reggie, who
could take a joke. “But you can bet if I get that
bunch of securities back, it’ll have to be more than
an artist who’ll get it away from me again. It’ll
have to be a magician, at the very least.”

“I’ve been wondering what we’ll do,” he continued,
“if the fellow refuses to talk.”

[91]

“I don’t think he’ll do that,” answered Joe.
“He’ll probably realize that the jig is up and make
a clean breast of the whole thing. If he doesn’t
I’ll try my ‘secret society’ gag and see if it will
work the second time. It worked like a charm
once and may again.”

They had to pass the hotel, and Sol Cramer,
who was standing just inside the door, motioned
them to come in.

“Haven’t a minute to stop, Sol,” explained Joe,
as they stepped inside. “I’m going down to the
jail with this friend of mine who has special business
with that crazy man. We may stop for a
minute on our way back. We’ll have a little time
to spare then. What’s up?”

“I won’t keep you long,” said Sol, after acknowledging
Joe’s introduction of Reggie. “I
just thought you might like to take a squint at the
New York papers. They’ve just got in, and the
sporting pages are full of that deal that puts you
on the Giants.”

Joe was getting used by this time to having his
picture and his name in the papers, but it was with
an especial thrill that he noted how much space
was bestowed on him and the flattering terms that
the reporters had used in describing his prowess as
a pitcher.

Flaring headlines headed each article in the
various papers:

[92]

McRAE STRENGTHENS HIS PITCHING
STAFF.


THE BIGGEST DEAL OF THE YEAR.


Giants’ Prospects Brighten.&mdash;Now for the
Pennant!


Below each headline was an extended story,
sketching Joe’s career from the time he had entered
Yale up to the present, and all of them
dwelling on his last year’s work with St. Louis,
and the splendid game he had pitched against the
Giants at the wind-up of the season. All agreed
that it was this game that had clinched McRae’s
determination to have Joe on his team.

“You seem to be the whole cheese,” remarked
Sol, with a grin. “Just now you’re the most distinguished
citizen of Riverside.”

“I’m afraid they’re spreading it on too thick,”
said Joe, who knew how precarious was a baseball
reputation. “By the end of the year they may
be calling me a ‘has-been’ and roasting McRae for
getting me on the team.”

“I’ll take a chance on that,” replied Sol confidently.
“You’ve been going up the ladder steadily
and you’re bound to climb higher. A fellow with
your habits is good for ten or fifteen years yet in
the big leagues&mdash;maybe twice as long as that.”

[93]

“That’s what!” chimed in Reggie emphatically.
“It’s the old rounders who trail along with drink
and who gamble that go back to the bushes. If a
man lives straight and cuts out the booze, he can
last as long in baseball as in anything else. Even
after he gets a little too old for playing, there are
plenty of splendid jobs as managers.”

“That’s right, too,” confirmed Sol. “Look at
Griff and Clarkey and Jenn and Connie. Why,
those fellows are getting enormous salaries!”

“Well, that’s looking a long way ahead,”
laughed Joe. “Just at present my job is to make
good as pitcher for the Giants, and I’ve got my
work cut out for me to do it. But we’ll have to
go now, Sol. Thank you for showing me the
papers.”

“Save a copy of each of them for me,” said
Reggie. “I’ll stop and get them on my way back.
I want to cut them out and send them to Mabel,”
he explained to Joe, as he hurried away. “She’s
so interested in baseball news, you know.”

Joe knew, and he hoped that the interest had
in it more of a personal touch than her brother
seemed to suspect.

A few minutes’ brisk walk brought them to the
jail, and Joe gave a vigorous tug at the bell.

They cooled their heels for two minutes without
any response, and Reggie became somewhat
impatient.

[94]

“Your jailer doesn’t seem to be an early riser,”
he remarked. “What’s the matter with him?”

“Oh, Hank Bailey was never known to do anything
in a hurry,” chuckled Joe. “Besides, he
hasn’t any helper here except his wife, and I suppose
he’s busy in some other part of the jail.”

Just then the door opened and Hank appeared.
But it was a very different Hank from the boastful
and self-confident individual of the day before.
He nodded gloomily to Joe, and stared at
his companion.

“What’s the matter, Hank?” questioned Joe.
“You look as though you had lost the last friend
you had on earth. Cheer up, the worst is yet to
come.”

“The worst has come already,” responded
Hank gloomily.

“What do you mean?” demanded Joe, in quick
alarm.

“That crazy man has skipped!” blurted out
Hank desperately, with the air of a man who
wants to tell the bad news quickly and have it
over with.

“What?” shouted Joe and Reggie in chorus.

“That’s what I said,” asserted Hank doggedly.

“When did he escape?” cried Joe, his anger
rising.

“How did you come to let him get away from
you?” demanded Reggie.

[95]

“You don’t suppose I let him go on purpose, do
you?” snarled Hank, driven to bay. “He knocked
me down and shut the cell door on me, and that’s
the last I saw of him.”

“Now look here, Hank,” said Joe, who had
gotten control of himself now that the first shock
of surprise was over, “this is a serious thing.
You’ve got to pull yourself together and think
quick, talk quick, and act quick. Tell us now just
what happened.”

“It was this way,” explained Hank, his sluggish
nature spurred on somewhat by Joe’s sharp,
decided tone. “He seemed all right when I went
the rounds for the last time last night. Was just
as gentle as a lamb. This morning, when I went
in to take him his breakfast he was asleep, as far
as I could make out. I stooped over to put the
tray on the bench, when he suddenly jumped up
and fetched me a clip under the chin that knocked
me down, me not looking for anything of the
kind. Before I could get to my feet, he’d dashed
out the cell and shut the door on me. It shuts
with a spring lock, and my keys were on the outside.
Then he gives an awful laugh and runs
down the corridor, and I suppose he let himself
out of the front door. I hammered on the cell
door and yelled until my wife heard me and came
and let me out.”

“How long ago did all this happen?” asked Joe.

[96]

“About half an hour ago,” answered Hank.

“I thought you had him strapped to the bed,”
said Reggie.

“So he was, but he had his watch and he broke
the crystal and sawed away at the straps until
they broke. I’ve just been looking over them.”

“But why haven’t you given an alarm?” demanded
Joe. “Don’t you realize that a dangerous
lunatic is at large and may kill somebody any
minute?”

“I was just getting ready to,” answered Hank.
“The truth is that I’m so dizzy and flabbergasted
that I don’t rightly know whether I’m on my
head or my heels.”

It was clear that it would not do to depend on
the jailer, and Joe took the matter in his own
hands.

“Come along, Reggie,” he cried. “The first
thing is to get downtown and give the alarm.
Then we’ll set the telegraph and the telephone
going and organize a searching party. He can’t
have gotten so very far away, and the chances are
that we’ll get him yet. Come along.”

They hurried down to the office of the chief of
police and told their story. The fire bell was
rung, a thing that was done only in the case of a
fire or an escape from jail, to put the people on
their guard. The news spread like wildfire
through the town. From telephone headquarters[97]
they called up every town within a radius of twenty
miles and described the fugitive. Joe hurriedly
called a number of his friends together, and in a
few minutes automobiles and sleighs were dashing
along every road that led out from town. They
inquired at every farmhouse, questioned every
passing traveler, fairly combed the surrounding
country. All that day and far into the night they
worked like troopers, only to return at last weary
and defeated.

Talham Tabbs had vanished as completely as
though the earth had swallowed him up!



[98]




CHAPTER XII
THE CALL TO BATTLE


It was a week later and Joe was returning from
the post-office where he had stopped for the late
afternoon mail.

Reggie had left the day before, although Joe
had urged him to remain longer. But a clue had
come from another State that, slender as it was,
seemed to offer some chance of running down the
elusive Tabbs, and Reggie had felt that he ought
to follow it up.

“It’s too bad, old man,” Joe had said to him, as
he stood on the station platform bidding the dudish
young man goodby, “to have come so near to
finding your man and yet just miss him.”

“Oh, it’s all in the game!” Reggie had answered,
assuming a cheerfulness he was far from
feeling. “I have a hunch that I’ll run across him
yet and bring him to a show-down.”

“I’ll keep my eyes wide open, too,” Joe assured
him, “and if I find out anything that will be of the
slightest help I’ll let you know at once.”

But it was not of Reggie that Joe was thinking,[99]
as he hurried home through the dusk of the short
winter afternoon. For he carried in his hand a
big official-looking letter that bore on the upper
left-hand corner the name of the New York Baseball
Club.

He felt sure that it contained the contract, concerning
which there had been so much speculation
in the Matson home for the last few days. But
eager as he was to know what it contained, he had
restrained himself until he reached home, so that
all could read it together.

“Here it is at last, Momsey!” he shouted, as he
burst into the warm bright sitting room waving the
envelope above his head.

“Oh, I’m so glad!” began his mother fondly,
while Clara was across the room like a whirlwind
and snatching at the letter.

“Open it up, open it up!” she pleaded. “I’m
nearly crazy to know what’s in it.”

“Little girls should be seen and not heard,”
teased her brother, as he held it tantalizingly out
of her reach.

But she tickled him under his arm so that he
dropped it with such undignified haste that she got
possession of the letter, and like a flash had put
the table between them.

Into the laughing group came Mr. Matson, just
returned from the Harvester Works.

“What’s all the racket about?” he asked.

[100]

“Oh, Dad!” cried Clara, running to him and
putting her arms about his neck. “It’s the letter
from the New York Club, and it has Joe’s contract
in it, and now we’ll know all about it and
whether it’s for one year or three years, and&mdash;&mdash;”

“It seems to me that you’re quite a prophetess,
young lady,” laughed her father, as he sat down
in his easy-chair and drew her to his lap, “especially
as the letter hasn’t been opened yet.”

“Perhaps it’s just a note telling me that after
thinking it over they don’t want me after all,”
teased Joe.

“Well, now that we’re all here, suppose you
settle the question by reading it,” suggested Mrs.
Matson.

There was a moment of breathless suspense and
it must be admitted that Joe’s hand was not quite
steady as he tore open the envelope. There was
a big formal document inside, and as Joe unfolded
it a little blue slip fluttered out and fell to the
floor. Clara was on it in an instant.

“It’s a check!” she exclaimed, with a little
squeal of delight. “That looks a lot as if they
didn’t want you, eh, Mr. Joseph Matson?”

It was a check for one hundred dollars to cover
traveling expenses to the training camp.

Joe cleared his throat and began to read the
formidable-looking document. It abounded with
any number of “wherefores” and “whereases,”[101]
but the sum and substance of it was that the New
York Club agreed to pay Joseph Matson the sum
of four thousand five hundred dollars a year, for
a period of three years from date.

Joe looked up at this point to see three shining
pairs of eyes fixed upon him, although a suspicious
moisture threatened to dim the brightness of those
belonging to his mother and his sister.

“Four thousand five hundred dollars!” exclaimed
Mr. Matson. “That’s an advance of
fifteen hundred dollars over what you got last
year. They certainly do things up in liberal
style.”

“And that isn’t all,” cried Joe eagerly, as his
eyes fell on a paragraph near the bottom of the
page. “Here’s a bonus clause.”

“A bonus clause?” interrupted Clara. “What
is that?”

“Something they offer as a premium if you do
more than is expected of you,” explained her
brother. “This says that I’ll get an extra thousand
dollars if I win twenty games during the season.”

“That ought to be easy enough, I should think,”
said Clara.

“Don’t you believe it,” laughed Joe. “In the
first place, if it were easy they wouldn’t offer me
anything extra for doing it. A pitcher is doing
very well who wins two-thirds of the games he[102]
pitches. On that basis I’d have to pitch thirty
games to have a chance of winning twenty. But
if his old pitchers are going strong, McRae may
keep me on the bench half the season and only put
me in when they fall down. He’s a great one for
depending on his old standbys. Then, too, I’ll be
a newcomer, and perhaps the team won’t play behind
me with the same confidence as when
Hughson or Markwith are on the mound. That
will make it harder for me to win games. You
must remember, too, that all the teams on the
circuit play harder against the New Yorks than
they do against any other team. They take a special
delight in downing the Giants before their
home crowds, and they always save up their best
pitchers for those occasions. So, take it altogether,
there’s only a mere chance to win my
twenty games during the season. I’m going to
take that chance, though,” and into Joe’s eyes
came a steely look that would have delighted McRae
if that fighting leader of the Giants could
have seen it.

The precious document was read and reread
and discussed in all its bearings until Mrs. Matson
insisted that supper would be stone cold if they
did not come to the table at once. It is safe to
say that in all Riverside that night no happier family
grouped itself around the table than that in
the Matson home.

[103]

“What’s the idea of the three-year clause, Joe?”
asked his father, when they had fairly settled
down to the meal. “Rather a compliment, I take
it.”

“It is a sort of compliment,” admitted Joe.
“They must feel pretty sure there’s something in
me to bind themselves to pay that salary for so
long a time. I didn’t really expect more than a
one-year contract. Of course there’s another side
to it. If I did especially well this first year, perhaps
they figure I’d get a swelled head and hold
them up for a big increase next year. As it is, no
matter how well I do, I can’t get any more salary
until the three-year period is up.

“Then too,” he went on, as he passed his plate
for another helping, “there’s been a good deal of
talk lately about this third big league. They’re
awfully anxious to get star players so as to draw
the public from the start, and the only way they
can get them is to coax them away from the National
or the American League. To do that they’ll
have to offer enormous salaries. If I were bound
for one year and the new league wanted me, they
might try to get me to promise to join them as soon
as my year was up. But with a three-year contract
holding me, McRae won’t have to worry.”

“Those clubs must be awfully rich to tie themselves
up for such an amount of money,” remarked
Mrs. Matson. “Suppose a player lost his skill.[104]
Would they have to go on paying him just the
same?”

“Not by a jugful,” laughed Joe. “There’s a
little joker in the contract that permits the club
to release a player on ten days’ notice.”

“But you can’t quit them on ten days’ notice!”
exclaimed Clara. “It doesn’t seem to me that
that’s fair.”

“It isn’t fair on the face of it,” admitted Joe,
“but as a matter of fact, it works out pretty well
in practice. In the first place, the club is crazy to
get hold of good players and is only too anxious
to keep them if they behave themselves and play
the game. If a player gets a ten days’ notice, it’s
usually because he deserves it. The club has to
have some protection against careless or drunken
or dissipated players, and the ten days’ notice gives
it to them.

“Take it altogether, the players get a square
deal,” he concluded. “They get bigger salaries
than almost any of them could command in any
other walk of life. They travel in Pullman cars
with every luxury that the richest passenger can
command. They dine and sleep in the finest hotels
in the country. When they’re on the road, all
their expenses are paid by the club, so that their
salaries are pure velvet. Nearly half the year
they have to themselves, and don’t have to work
at all unless they want to. During their playing[105]
days they have plenty of time to study and prepare
themselves for some profession later on.
Lots of them become lawyers or dentists or prosperous
business men. Some of them go on the
stage and make more in a month than the average
man can make in a year. Hughson of the New
Yorks opened an insurance office one winter and
people fairly fell over each other to do business
with him. They just wanted to tell their friends
that they had done business with the great Hughson.

“Oh, we poor baseball ‘slaves’ are doing pretty
well, thank you,” Joe ended, with a laugh, as his
hand tightened on the contract and the crisp blue
check that had come with it.



[106]




CHAPTER XIII
OFF FOR THE TRAINING CAMP


The next few days flew by as though on wings.
There were a hundred things to be done before
Joe would set out on the long swing around the
circuit that was to increase or diminish his fame,
as fate might decree. Above all, he was anxious
to spend all the time he could in practice, so as to
report at the training camp in superb condition.

One thing that pleased him immensely was the
success of the scheme he had carried through with
Dick Talbot. True to his promise, Dick had been
on hand at the appointed time with his camera and
they had carried out the program he had suggested.
Joe broke the white sheet of paper
stretched between the bamboo poles so repeatedly
and conclusively that only an idiot could have questioned
that he had curved the ball. And it is only
fair to state that when the film was reeled off before
the astonished eyes of Professor Enoch
Crabbe he admitted this fact.

“I have to admit that you are right, Mr. Matson,”
he avowed, “and I’m sorry that I was so[107]
positive about it the other day. I shall have to
study up the law that controls the curve, and by
the time you come back at the end of the season
perhaps I shall have found out what it is.”

“I’m sure that you can find it if anybody can,
Professor,” said Joe, not to be outdone in politeness;
and so the two opponents parted with increased
respect for each other.

“I hear the Giants are going to train at Marlin
Springs this year,” said Tom Davis, as they left
the gymnasium and walked up the street together.

“Yes,” answered Joe. “McRae seems to have
a liking for Texas as a place to get in condition.
And he ought to know, for he’s tried almost every
place on the map. He’s taken his team to Birmingham,
to Memphis, to Los Angeles, and one
year he didn’t go any farther south than Lakewood,
New Jersey. So that if he’s finally fixed on
Marlin, he must believe that it has advantages
over all the others.”

“Isn’t this southern training trip a rather modern
idea?” asked Tom.

“Oh, no,” answered Joe. “All the big teams
have been doing it for a number of years now. I
think it was old Cap Anson of the Chicagos who
started the thing, in 1882. He took the team
down south while all the other teams stayed in
the north as usual. The result was that when the
Chicagos came north they mowed down the other[108]
teams like grass and won the pennant that year
without half trying. That put a flea in the ears of
the other managers, and since then it has been a
regular thing. It’s a mighty good thing, too, in
more ways than one. It gives the manager a
chance to try out all the material he has bought or
drafted from the minor leagues. In the north,
with so many cold and rainy days, they wouldn’t
get half a chance. Then, too, there are usually
plenty of good teams in the vicinity of the training
grounds and the boys can get plenty of practice in
regular games without the weather’s interfering.
McRae, for instance, can find crack teams at Dallas
and Waco and Houston that sometimes give
the Giants all they want to do to win. The result
is that when the boys come north they’re in crackerjack
condition. They’re like so many thoroughbreds
waiting for the flag to fall, and the public
gets good games for its money from the very start
of the season.”

“Just what time do you have to report?” asked
Tom.

“In just about a week,” answered Joe. “I think
I’ll start next Thursday afternoon.”

“Are you going straight to New York and go
south with the rest of the team?” Tom inquired.

“I don’t think so,” was the reply. “McRae left
it to me to pick out my route in any way that would
be most convenient to me as long as I joined the[109]
party somewhere on the way. I think I’ll go by
way of Goldsboro, North Carolina. The boys go
through there, and that will be as good a place as
any to meet them.”

Joe spoke with an elaborate affectation of carelessness,
but he could not prevent that troublesome
blood of his from flooding his face.

“Gee, Joe, but you’re red!” cried honest Tom.
“You haven’t been exercising too much this afternoon,
have you?”

“Not a bit of it,” returned Joe, with unnecessary
emphasis. “I never felt better in my life.”

But if he could fool Tom, he could not “get
away with it” with Clara, and he was subjected to
an unmerciful teasing when that young lady
learned of the route he had chosen.

“Goldsboro, North Carolina,” she mused.
“Where have I heard that name before? Oh, how
stupid of me! Of course, that is where Reggie
lives. I suppose you’re awfully anxious to see
him.”

But Joe was so engrossed in his packing just
then that he pretended not to hear, and all her
efforts to get a reply out of him, although carried
out with a perseverance worthy of a better cause,
ended in comparative failure.

The dreaded afternoon came at last, dreaded
by all the members of the little family who were
welded so closely together in heart and life. The[110]
others all went down to the train to see Joe off,
and it was only the presence of a large part of the
population of Riverside, who had come with a
similar purpose, that kept the mother and sister
from breaking down entirely at the thought of the
long parting from the son and brother that they
idolized. As it was, they bore up bravely, and
waved their handkerchiefs with smiles that were
tremulous as the train moved out of the station to
the accompaniment of a storm of cheers from the
crowd that packed the platform. Joe waved back,
but he had eyes for only three figures in all that
throng. The train rounded a curve and he was
off, leaving the old home town behind him for
many months to come.

The train was a local and he had to travel
twenty miles before he should reach the Junction,
where he was to connect with the “Flyer.” He
found the latter train puffing impatiently when he
arrived, and it was the work of a moment to
transfer his belongings to the sleeper. He found
the seat which his ticket called for and settled
down for an unbroken trip to Goldsboro.

He was lost in the pleasant thoughts this name
called up when the porter passed through announcing
that dinner was ready in the dining car. Joe’s
healthy appetite seldom had to be prodded by a
second announcement, and he promptly went forward.
He found a good seat facing forward, and[111]
he was soon engrossed in a careful study of the
bill of fare. It proved to be all that he could ask,
and he soon had a most tempting and abundant
meal spread before him.

He applied himself to this conscientiously, and
was half-way through the meal when a man took
the seat directly opposite him. Joe gave him a
passing glance and saw that he was a man rather
advanced in years but who bore himself with a
certain suppleness and vigor that bespoke an early
athletic training. It was an honest, pleasing face
he had, Joe decided, after a careless glance. Then
he went on eating and forgot all about the
stranger.

But the newcomer kept looking at Joe from
time to time with a puzzled expression, as though
he had seen him before but scarcely knew how to
place him. Several times he seemed on the point
of addressing the young pitcher, but checked himself.
At last the impulse proved too strong for
him to resist.

“Beg pardon,” he said, “but your face looks
very familiar to me. Would you mind telling me
your name?”

Joe looked up with quick suspicion. He had
been approached more than once by oily strangers
who had sought to scrape acquaintance, and he
had learned to be on his guard. But there was
nothing in the frank smile and candid face before[112]
him to arouse distrust, and he answered readily:

“Not the least in the world. My name is Joseph
Matson.”

“Not the Matson that is going to play on the
Giants this year?” asked the stranger eagerly.

“I guess I am,” returned Joe, smiling.

“That explains why your face looked so familiar!”
exclaimed the other. “I’ve seen your
picture in various papers twenty times in the last
week. I’ve read all about you, and I’m mighty
glad to meet you. My name is Wilson, and I’m
an old ball player myself. In fact, I guess I was
playing professional ball twenty years or more before
you were born.”

“That’s a long time ago,” laughed Joe, as he
took the stranger’s offered hand and shook it
heartily. “What team did you play on and what
was your position?”

“I played right field on the old Red Stockings
of Cincinnati,” was the answer.

Joe almost jumped out of his seat.

“Not the Red Stockings, the team of 1869?”
he cried. “Not the team that whipped them all,
that went through the whole season without losing
a single game?”

“That was my team,” was the answer given
calmly, though a gleam of pride and exultation
came into the stranger’s eyes as he noted Joe’s
enthusiasm.



[113]




CHAPTER XIV
DIAMOND HEROES


Joe was all excitement and animation. He had
never dreamed that he would ever be sitting face
to face with one of the famous team that swept
through our country like a prairie fire and made a
record that has never been equaled in the history
of baseball.

“This is sure my lucky day!” he cried. “I’d
willingly have traveled hundreds of miles to have
a look at you and hear you talk. And here you
drop right down at my table! I’ll have something
to tell the rest of the boys that will make them
green with envy. I give you fair warning that
I’m going to keep you talking till bedtime or until
I pump you dry.”

The old-time player laughed at Joe’s delight,
but he would have been more or less than human
if he had not been pleased by it.

“I’m afraid you make too much of it,” he said,
with a deprecating wave of the hand. “You young
fellows have the center of the stage just now. We
old boys are the has-beens. There are only four[114]
of our old team left. All the others have crossed
the Great Divide.”

“Their memory won’t die, though, as long as
there is a baseball fan left in these United States,”
declared Joe. “Why, there’s scarcely a ‘fanning
bee’ that I’ve ever been in, but what the name of
the famous old Red Stockings comes up in some
way or other. They’ve left a mark upon the game
that will never grow dim.”

“It’s good to hear you say so, anyway,” said
Wilson. “We thought ourselves that we were
‘some pumpkins’ when we started out, especially
after we’d handed a few lacings to some of the
other teams, but we never thought we were going
to win fifty-seven games right off the reel. We
used to look at each other, as one team after the
other fell by the wayside, and wonder when our
turn would come. It certainly seemed a miracle
that we should escape with a whole skin every
time. I suppose we would have gone under toward
the end of the season if our reputation
hadn’t scared the other teams so that they were
licked before they came on the field. As it was,
the scores as a rule weren’t even close. Our tightest
squeeze was when we whipped the Mutuals of
New York by four to two. But the way we treated
the Buckeye team was a sin and a shame,” he
chuckled. “We walloped them by one hundred
and three to eight.”

[115]

The veteran was getting warmed up now and
his eyes flashed as he recalled the glorious exploits
of his young manhood.

Just then the waiter came along and placed
two checks on the table. Wilson reached for his,
but Joe was too quick for him.

“No, you don’t,” he laughed, as his hand closed
over both checks. “This is on me. It isn’t often
that one has a chance of having a Red Stocking
for a guest, and I’m going to make the most of it.”

“‘Youth will be served,’” quoted Wilson, with
a smile, as he acquiesced good-naturedly.

“I hope you’re not traveling with anybody,”
said Joe, as they rose to leave the table, “because
if you’re not I hope to have your company for
the rest of the evening.”

“I’m all by my lonesome,” returned his new
friend, “and I’ll be only too glad to accept your
invitation. To tell the truth, I was looking forward
to a dull evening all by myself, as my eyes
are not strong enough to do much reading at
night.”

They made their way back to Joe’s reservation
and settled themselves cozily for a long talk.
They formed a dramatic contrast, if they had
thought of it. On the one hand was a veteran,
who, like Goldsmith’s soldier:


“Shouldered his crutch to show how fields were won,”


[116]

while Joe presented a picture of eager, ambitious
youth, dreaming of coming fame and standing
with shining eyes on the very threshold of achievement.
But though so widely separated in years,
they were one in the mystic free masonry that
unites all lovers of the great national game of our
country.

“We didn’t use to travel in any such style as
this in the old days,” remarked Wilson, as he
looked around at the rich appointments of the
Pullman. “As a matter of fact, we had to scratch
sometimes to get money enough to carry the team
from one place to another in an ordinary day
coach. Those were the days when baseball was
a sport, pure and simple, and nobody thought of
it as a business to make money from. Usually
there were no regular salaries for the players, and
they simply divided up the receipts from the different
games and made them go as far as they
would. Many of the games were played in open
fields, where everybody could come and contribute
what they liked when the hat was passed for
the collection. Even when there were enclosed
grounds, the admission fee was twenty-five cents
or less, and except on special occasions the crowds
were nowhere near as large as they are to-day.
But we’d rather play than eat, and we played the
game for the fun we could get out of it. And fun
it was, I assure you.”

[117]

“You spoke of making over a hundred runs in
a single game,” remarked Joe. “There must have
been some walloping of the horsehide, and I feel
sorry for the fielders that had to chase the ball.”

“They certainly got plenty of exercise,” chuckled
Wilson. “Of course, the batters in those days
had a big advantage over the pitchers. Nobody
knew anything about curving the ball until the
time of Cummings and Mathews, and instead of
the ball looking like a pea as it came over the
plate it was more like a balloon. The ball had no
friends, and everybody took a poke at it. The
batter, too, could step out of the box to reach for
a ball, and they took advantage of it. If they do
it today, you call them out. There was no ‘waiting
out’ the pitcher in order to get a base on
balls. It was a point of honor to swipe the ball
for all you were worth, and the public expected
you to do it.

“It was mighty hard on the fielders in the old
days,” he went on, “because none of them wore
gloves, and as the ball was harder and livelier
than it is today, broken fingers were much more
common. I’ve seen some of the old boys who
had had every finger on both hands broken at
some time or another. I was an outfielder and got
off more easily; but I’ve had two broken fingers,”
and he held up his right hand for Joe to see.

“I don’t see how the catchers got along without[118]
gloves, even if the other players did,” suggested
Joe.

“Well, the pitching wasn’t as swift then as it is
now,” explained the veteran. “Besides, base
stealing hadn’t been reduced to the science it is
today, and the catchers didn’t need to get hold of
the ball in such a hurry. Moreover, a third strike
was out if the catcher caught it on the first bound,
so that as a rule they relied on this and stood a
good way behind the plate.”

“Do you think that the game has advanced very
much since the old days?” asked Joe.

“Oh, immensely!” was the generous and unexpected
concession. “We didn’t know anything in
the old days of the ‘inside stuff’ you set such store
by today. The ‘squeeze play,’ the ‘delayed steal,’
the ‘sacrifice hit’ are all modern inventions. But
when it comes to fielding, there isn’t a man to-day
that could show George Wright anything at shortstop
or Ross Barnes at second base. And we had
batters that could give points to Wagner and
Cobb.”

“I suppose you wanted to ‘kill the umpire’ once
in a while, just as we do now,” suggested Joe, with
a grin.

“Once in a while, but not so often,” smiled the
other. “Umpiring was a mighty sight easier job
then than now. The umpire used to sit in an easy
chair at the side of the plate and a good distance[119]
off so that there was no danger of being hit by a
thrown ball or a foul tip. But he didn’t get the
big salary that the men with the indicator get today.
Two or three dollars at the end of a game
was considered plenty, and there were lots of
times when he didn’t get even that.”

“I’ll bet you’ve seen some sparkling plays in
your time,” said Joe.

“You’re just right,” agreed Wilson. “I’ve seen
lots of things that took the spectators clear off
their feet. One of the queerest I remember was
a triple play made by an outfielder. Have you
ever seen one?”

“I’ve only seen one in my life,” answered Joe.
“They are pretty scarce birds and often the league
goes through a whole season without one being
made. And when they do happen, it’s an infielder
who makes it. I don’t exactly see how an outfielder
could pull it off.”

“I don’t think it has ever been done but once,”
returned Wilson, “and I had the luck to be playing
in that game. Paul Hines, the center fielder
of the Providence Club, was the player who turned
the trick.

“There were men on second and third and nobody
out. The man at bat lifted a short fly into
center, just back of short. It seemed a dead certainty
that the ball would fall safe, and the men
on bases set sail for the home plate. Hines came[120]
in like a quarter horse and just managed to catch
the ball on a level with his shoe tops. In the
meantime, the man on third had reached home and
the man from second had rounded third and was
scooting for the plate. Hines had had to run so
far in that he was close to third, so he simply kept
on running and stepped on the bag. That of
course put out both men, who couldn’t get back
to third in time, which, with the fly catch, made
three out in all. It was a remarkable play, and it
was a long time before the papers got through
talking about it.”

“I don’t wonder,” Joe declared. “It was a
case of dandy fielding and quick thinking.”

“But now tell me about yourself,” urged Wilson.
“Here I’ve been running on, as old fellows
will, and you’ve hardly said a word about yourself.”

“The case is different,” protested Joe. “You’re
the fellow who has actually done things, and I’m
the one who’s only hoping to do them.”

“You can’t tell me that,” came back Wilson.
“Any man who has already had a season with the
St. Louis Club in the National League and was so
good that McRae made a grab for him, has already
done things worth doing. I’ve seen your
record, young man, and it’s a crackerjack. I’m
looking for you to burn things up, when the season
opens.”

[121]

“I only hope you’re right,” said Joe. “But it’s
going to be a tough proposition. All the clubs
have been strengthened since last season, and there
isn’t one of them that can be figured as an easy
mark. Chicago and Pittsburgh especially will be
strong contenders, and the club that beats them
out will win the pennant. I think the Giants have
the best chance, but if we do win we’ll know we’ve
been in a fight.”

The talk continued with such a disregard for
the passage of time that before they knew it most
of the berths had been made up and all the passengers
except themselves were getting ready to
retire. Then Wilson rose.

“My berth is in the next sleeper,” he said, as
he extended his hand, “and as I reach my station
at five o’clock in the morning I won’t have a
chance to see you again right away. But I’ll see
you play more than once this season. I hope
you’ll have the best of luck and come out ahead in
the race for the pennant. And I’m more glad
than I can tell that I’ve run across you. With
young men like you in it, the future of the game
is safe.”

Joe shook hands warmly.

“The game would have gone to smash long ago
if it hadn’t been for the strong foundation laid for
it by famous old teams like yours,” he asserted.
“As for me, I’ll never forget as long as I live that[122]
I’ve shaken hands with one of the old Red Stockings
of sixty-nine.”

Joe was in high spirits after his visitor left.
The chance meeting had braced him like a tonic.
If he had been the least bit superstitious, he might
have been inclined to look upon it as more than a
coincidence.

Here he is, on his way to join the most famous
team of the present. At the very start of
his journey he meets a member of the most famous
team of the past.

Is it an omen of coming triumph? At any
rate, it is an inspiration.

That night in his sleep Joe pitched the Giants
to victory!



[123]




CHAPTER XV
A CHARMING VISION


“Only a dream,” commented Joe, as he was
dressing the next morning, “and they say dreams
go by contraries. Let’s hope that won’t hold true
in this case. If I could only strike out Wagner
on the field as easily as I did in my sleep, there’d
be nothing to the race except the Giants.”

He was sorry that he could not see Wilson opposite
him at breakfast as he had been at supper
on the night before, but he supplemented the absence
of the veteran by a newspaper which he
propped up before him as he sipped his coffee.
Mrs. Matson had always objected to this at home,
on the ground that it was unsociable, and Joe had
respected her wishes; but just now he had no one
to consult except himself, and he did as he chose.
Joe had a shrewd idea that all women felt the
same way and resented having a rival in the newspaper.
Probably Mabel herself&mdash;&mdash; But pshaw!
that thought didn’t bother him. Who would
want to look at an old newspaper when opposite
him at the table was something so much better to[124]
look at, something that wore fetching little boudoir
caps and all sorts of dainty frilly things,
something with brown eyes and wavy hair, something
that laughed and teased and bewitched while
it poured the coffee?

“Come, old man,” Joe said to himself, “this
will never do. Brace up and get on the job. Help
the Giants to win the flag, get a slice of the money
from the World’s Series, and then you’ll be in a
position to ask the sweetest girl in the world
whether she is willing to pour your coffee for the
rest of her life.”

Naturally it was the sporting page that engrossed
most of his attention. A great deal of
space was devoted to the departure of McRae and
most of the Giants from New York on their way
to the grounds at Marlin for the spring training
trip. Rosy predictions were indulged in as to the
result of the coming season. The general opinion
seemed to be that New York had a capital chance
for the pennant, now that McRae had plugged up
two weak places in the team, and especially because
he had strengthened his pitching staff by
the addition of Matson, who had done such sterling
work in the box for the Cardinals the previous
season.

These predictions interested Joe, but were not
especially convincing. He had seen so many
“good things” go wrong, so many teams strong[125]
on paper “come a cropper,” while those who were
only given an outside chance by the baseball
scribes came up from the ruck, that he had become
an habitual resident of “Missouri,” and had to be
“shown.” Moreover, this was a New York paper,
and he knew that local sheets in the seven
other cities of the National League were industriously
trying to prove, to their own satisfaction
at least, that their favorite sons could not lose.

What did have an especial interest for him,
however, was an article that told of his exploit in
subduing Talham Tabbs. The news had filtered
out from Riverside through the columns of the
local paper, and the metropolitan sporting reporter
had been quick to recognize it as having all
the elements of a good story. So he had featured
it for all that he was worth, even introducing an
imaginary picture of the madman standing on the
lumber pile while Joe was in the act of hurling the
ball.

Joe was amused and rather pleased, and yet he
knew that the story would win him a large amount
of banter from his mates.

“They’ll be joking about Matson’s ‘freeze’ ball
from now to the end of the season,” he grinned.
“Well, as long as it gives ‘cold feet’ to the batters
I have to face, I won’t have to worry about it.”

He made a hearty breakfast and strolled back
into his car, wholly at peace with himself and the[126]
world. The pleasant influence of his dream still
clung around him, and then, too, every mile traversed
by the “Flyer” was bringing him nearer
and nearer to Goldsboro.

It is not to be hastily assumed from this that
Joe was unduly anxious to meet his new team-mates.
There would be plenty of time to become
acquainted with them before the season closed.
In fact, he would probably have a surfeit of their
society.

But Goldsboro was a pleasant town, and he
would have four hours to stay before the train
from New York bearing McRae and his men
should pull into the station.

While he had been in the dining car the train
had stopped at a station and several passengers
had boarded it. Joe noticed as he went to his
seat that the car seemed fuller than when he had
left it.

He sat looking out of the windows at the flying
scenery for a while, and then, as the train boy
stopped at his seat, he put his hand in his pocket
for some change to buy a magazine that had an
unusually attractive cover.

But as he settled back to study it, his eye, roving
over the car, caught sight of something vastly
more attractive.

Three seats in front of him next the window sat
a girl. He could not see her face, but there was[127]
something in the tilt of the head that reminded
him of Mabel.

He sat for a moment as if transfixed. The
next instant he was standing before her, hat in
hand, his eyes eloquent with pleasure at this unexpected
meeting.

“Mabel!” he stammered.

She looked up and her face flooded with color.

“Joe!” she exclaimed delightedly. “How glad
I am to see you!” And then as though she had
been betrayed into saying more than she intended
her face became still rosier. Joe decided on the
spot that pink was his favorite color.



  

“JOE!” SHE EXCLAIMED DELIGHTEDLY. “HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU!”


“What on earth brought you down this way?”
she asked, as she made room for Joe to sit down
beside her, a permission of which he availed himself
with alacrity.

“I guess it’s because I’m the luckiest man on
earth,” said Joe gallantly.

“What a pretty speech!” and she dimpled mischievously.
Joe had never known that dimples
could be so distracting.

“It seems to me that you are pretty far from
home yourself,” he declared.

“Are you complaining on that account?” she
laughed.

“Anything but that,” protested the young
pitcher, and the look that accompanied the words
was convincing evidence of his sincerity.

[128]

“I’ve been attending a wedding of one of my
old schoolmates,” explained Mabel. “We had
been great chums at boarding school and nothing
would do but that I should act as her bridesmaid.
We had a great time, and after the happy couple
had started on their honeymoon, her parents insisted
that I should stay a day or two with them.
I wanted to get home yesterday, but they wouldn’t
have it.”

Joe mentally blessed the unknown benefactors
who had prevented Mabel from taking an earlier
train.

“I guess I know after all, why you are coming
in this direction,” she went on. “You know I’m
greatly interested in baseball and I’ve been keeping
pretty well posted as to the doings of the
teams. I see that Mr. Joseph Matson is no longer
a member of the St. Louis nine,” she said archly.

“No,” laughed Joe. “They got tired of me
and so they wished me on the New Yorks.”

“Isn’t that glorious!” declared Mabel with unaffected
enthusiasm. “I’ve been wanting to have
a chance to congratulate you ever since I heard
the news. It’s a great step forward, and it’s
wonderful when you think that you’ve only been
in the league a year. But I’m not a bit surprised,
after seeing some of the games you pitched last
year. That last one you pitched in New York
was just splendid.”

[129]

“Do you know why it was so good?” said Joe,
earnestly, bending toward her. “It was because
I had a mascot in the grandstand that day and I
simply couldn’t lose.”

“Is that so?” asked Mabel, innocently. “Dear
me, how very interesting! I’ve always heard that
ball players were superstitious. What kind of
a mascot was it?”

“Why,” said Joe, “it had brown eyes and the
most beautiful wavy hair, and a lot of dimples
and&mdash;&mdash;”

“Oh, look at that funny little farmhouse,” hastily
remarked Mabel, looking out of the window.
“Did you ever see anything so quaint?”

But Joe, who had not the slightest interest in
quaint farmhouses just at this moment, persisted:

“As I was saying, this mascot&mdash;&mdash;”

“Yes,” interrupted Mabel, “but tell me one
thing that I’m just dying to know. Do you think
the New Yorks will win the pennant this year?”

And Joe, despite himself, was forced to bow
to her will and change the subject. But he mentally
resolved that he would yet tell her what he
wanted to about that mascot.

“That’s something that’s pretty hard to tell,”
he answered. “We’ve got a mighty strong team
on paper, and if we get our share of the breaks,
I don’t see anything that’s going to beat us out.”

“Won’t that be fine!” she exclaimed. “And[130]
that’ll mean that you’ll play in the World’s Series.
Oh, if you could win the championship of
the league and the championship of the world in
the same year!”

“It’s asking a good deal,” laughed Joe, “but
stranger things than that have happened. It
would mean a lot of glory and it would also mean
a lot of money.”

“Oh, you mercenary men!” she smiled. “Always
thinking about money.”

“Sure,” said Joe. “Why shouldn’t they. What
do you think they want the money for? Listen,
Mabel. Shall I tell you what Clara said would
be a good thing for me to do with the Series
money if I get a part of it?”

But Mabel scented danger and again she
fenced.

“Don’t trouble,” she said. “I’ll write to Clara
and ask her about it.”

Poor Joe realized how helpless a mere man is
in the hands of a pretty girl when she wants to
make him speak or refrain from speaking. But
he clung desperately to the theme in the hope
that in some way or other it would give him an
opening.

“I saw a moving picture the other day that
was a dandy,” he went on. “It showed the winners
of the Series last year getting their checks
in the office of the Treasurer. Were they a happy[131]
looking bunch? I should say so. One of the
checks was flashed on the screen and it showed
figures for three thousand eight hundred dollars
odd.”

“A little fortune in its way,” agreed Mabel.

“I should say it was,” continued Joe. “Why,
do you know what a man could do with that
money? He could get a cozy little home and
furnish it and&mdash;&mdash;”

“Speaking of Reggie&mdash;&mdash;” interrupted Mabel
hurriedly.

“I wasn’t speaking of Reggie,” said Joe, exasperatedly.
At that moment he could have wished
the unoffending Reggie at the bottom of the sea.

“I know we weren’t,” said Mabel, sweetly, “but
really we ought to be because I’m awfully worried
about the dear boy. He’s been acting so queerly
of late. Hasn’t seemed to have any appetite,
and at night I can hear him walking the floor in
his room. I’ve tried to get him to tell me what
is troubling him, but he just says it is nothing and
I can’t get any satisfaction. Then too, he’s constantly
taking flying trips all over the country.
He’s been away now for some time and in one
of his letters he told me that he had seen you.
Did he tell you what was on his mind?”

It was very hard to resist the pleading in those
brown eyes, but Joe was loyal to that free masonry
that makes men hang together. And besides,[132]
the little witch had been tantalizing him so,
that there was a little wicked satisfaction in having
the whip hand himself, if only for a moment.

“Why, Reggie seemed very much as usual,”
he declared. “If he was a bit worried, it’s only
what all men feel at times. I know that more
than once after I’ve lost a close game I’ve been
like a bear with a sore head. He’ll be all right,
no doubt, after a while. Do you think he’s at
home now?”

“I rather think he is,” returned Mabel, “but
I’m not sure. He wrote me that he expected to
get home some day this week. But you’ll have
a chance to see for yourself when we get to Goldsboro.
Of course, you’ll come up to our house
for dinner?”

“Do you really want me to?” he asked.

“Of course I do,” she returned. “Mother will
be glad to meet you again too. She’s talked a
lot about you since the last time you were there.
She thinks you’re such a handsome young man,”
she added mischievously, for the pleasure of seeing
him blush.

“By the way,” she went on, enjoying his confusion,
“I’ve seen your picture in the papers so
often for this last week or two.”

“It’s a shame to spoil good paper by putting
my ugly phiz upon it,” said Joe, getting redder
still.

[133]

“Ugly!” exclaimed Mabel, warmly. “I think
it’s just&mdash;&mdash;”

She checked herself as though she had gone
too far, and now it was her turn to blush.

“What do they say about the great Mr. Matson
in today’s papers?” she asked lightly. “I haven’t
seen a copy yet. Have you got one? I’d like
to see it, if you have.”

Her wish was a command and Joe went to his
seat returning with the paper. She turned to the
sporting page and her eye fell upon the picture
of Joe in the lumber yard.

“Why, what’s this?” she asked, wonderingly.

“Oh, it’s a little thing that happened in Riverside,”
answered Joe. “The newspapers got hold
of it and are making a mountain out of a molehill.”

With quickening curiosity, Mabel read the account
from beginning to end. When she had
finished she looked up at Joe, and there was something
in her eyes that Joe had longed to see there,
something that made his heart give a wild leap.

“Goldsboro,” shouted the brakeman, putting
his head in the door. “All out for Goldsboro!”



[134]




CHAPTER XVI
THE GIANT TEAM


There was a mad scramble to gather their belongings
together and by the time they were going
down the aisle of the car Mabel had recovered
something of her self possession.

“I’m going to steal this paper from you,” she
said, “and I just want to tell you that it was one
of the finest things I’ve ever heard or read about.
There isn’t one man in a million that would have
thought and acted so quickly and skillfully. So
there now, Mr. Hero,” she added in a lighter
tone, to conceal her real feeling.

Joe, whose head was in a whirl and who was not
quite sure whether he was in Goldsboro or
Heaven or a blending of both, was about to reply
when a well-known voice fell on his ears:

“Hello, Sis! Why, Joe Matson, by all that’s
lucky! What good wind blew you into Goldsboro?
Welcome to our city.”

And the next minute Reggie had grasped his[135]
hand and was shaking it as though he would
wring it off.

Joe returned the greeting with equal cordiality.

“How are you, Reggie, old man!” he exclaimed.
“I’m awfully glad to find you at home. I was talking
to Mabel about you and she wasn’t sure
whether you would be here or not. I’m certainly
in luck meeting two of the best friends I have on
the same day.”

“It was a big surprise to me,” said Mabel,
“when Joe seemed to rise up like a ghost out of
the floor of the car.”

“A pretty substantial ghost, I take it,” laughed
Reggie, as he took in the stalwart frame and perfect
condition of his friend.

“Joe’s coming up to the house for dinner,”
went on Mabel.

“You just bet he is,” declared Reggie. “He
doesn’t get out of my clutches as long as he stays
in Goldsboro. Hope you can make us a good
visit, Joe.”

“About four hours or so,” laughed Joe.

“Four hours only!” Reggie stared at him
blankly. “What’s the answer?”

“Joe’s on his way to the training camp at Marlin
Springs,” explained Mabel. “The Giants pass
through here this afternoon and Joe is going to
join them when their train comes along.”

[136]


“If so soon I’m to be done for,
I wonder what I was begun for,”


quoted Joe, with a smile.

“It’s too bad,” declared Reggie with unaffected
regret. “But since the minutes are so precious
we’ll make every one of them count. I’ve got my
buzz wagon outside. Give me your traps and
bundle in, both of you.”

Joe helped Mabel into the rear seat, holding
her hand perhaps a wee bit longer than necessary
in doing so, and then settled down beside
her, while Reggie grasped the wheel and threw
in the clutch. Reggie’s judgment in cars was
good, however much it might go astray when it
came to finance, and he was a skilled driver, so
that it was not long before they had left the
business part of the town behind them and were
threading the more fashionable street that led
to the Varley mansion.

“It’s a splendid day for motoring!” exclaimed
Mabel. “I wish we were going further.”

“The end of the world wouldn’t be too far, if
you were alongside of me,” affirmed Joe, trying
to look into her eyes.

But because she was afraid perhaps to let him
see just then what was written there, she kept
them averted, though a tell-tale flood of color
rioted from neck to brow.

[137]

They stopped before a large substantial house
that bore every mark of solid prosperity. Reggie
jumped out and threw open the door and Joe
helped Mabel to alight. She ran lightly up the
steps with a gay little wave of her hand.

“I suppose Reggie will want you to go with
him while he puts the car into the garage,” she
said. “In the meantime, I’ll prepare the folks
inside for the great honor that has come upon
them. It isn’t often that we have a chance to entertain
a hero.”

Joe shook his finger at her menacingly, as with
a laugh she entered the door that was opened
by a servant.

“I suppose Mabel was referring to that scrap
you had with Talham Tabbs,” said Reggie, as
he guided the car to the garage in the rear of
the house.

“Yes,” replied Joe, “as luck would have it, one
of the New York papers got hold of that and
played it up strong. Mabel happened to get
hold of it on the train and she’s given it a good
deal more importance than it is worth.”

“She can’t very well do that,” protested Reggie
warmly, “for it was a good piece of work,
don’t you know. I’d have told her of it myself
before this, only I was afraid that she might get
on to that wretched muddle of mine.”

“How about that, by the way?” asked Joe,[138]
eagerly. “Tell me now while you have a chance.
Have you found any clue to the fellow’s whereabouts?”

“Not a thing,” replied Reggie, gloomily. “I’ve
been following up tips ever since I left Riverside
and I’m no nearer to him now than I was then.”

“It’s too bad,” consoled Joe. “It beats all how
that fellow could have made such a getaway. It
wasn’t half an hour after he had escaped before
we were hot on his track. He didn’t have any hat
or overcoat, and everybody was on the lookout
for him. How on earth could he have managed
it?”

“Search me,” said Reggie, disgustedly. “That
fellow is as slick as greased lightning. He proved
that by the way he got hold of my securities. All
madmen are said to be cunning, but I’ll bet he
could give cards and spades to the whole bunch
and beat them out. I suppose there’s nothing left
for me but to make a clean breast of it to the
governor. As it is, I’m only sending good money
after bad, running round the country as I do.”

“Don’t give up yet, old man,” cried Joe, clapping
him heartily on the shoulder. “While there’s
life there’s hope. The game isn’t over till the
last man’s out in the ninth inning. Buck up. You
may be happy yet. You can tell your father any
time, but there’s no use doing it until your year
is up and you have to. If there’s anything that I[139]
have learned from baseball it is never to stop
trying. Get up on your toes and play the game.”

“By George, old man, it’s good to hear you
talk that way!” cried Reggie, with a sudden accession
of hope. “I get so moody and dopey
mulling the thing over to myself that I lose heart.
But you’re right. I’ll pull myself together and
fight the thing out to a finish.”

“That’s the real stuff,” approved Joe. “The
man can’t stay hidden forever, and any day may
see the end of the chase. I have a feeling that
you’re going to win out. But there’s one thing
I’d do, old fellow. Tell Mabel all about it. As
you said yourself one time, she’s a thoroughbred.
She’ll stick to you through thick and thin. She’s
worrying about you now because she knows there’s
something wrong with you and you won’t tell
her what it is. If you talk it over with her, it
will take a load off your mind and hers too. Besides,
you’ll have a better chance of winning. Two
heads are better than one and what one doesn’t
think of the other will. She was asking me about
it today. Of course, I didn’t give you away, but
I made up my mind then that I would ask you
to tell her the whole story. It’ll clear the air,
you’ll both be happier, and your chances will be
vastly better.”

“Old top, I think you’re right,” replied Reggie,
who had a great respect for Joe’s judgment.[140]
“She and I have always been great pals and we
think the world of each other. I didn’t want to
put my burden on her shoulders, but, as you say,
she will worry more if she doesn’t know than if
she does. I’ll tell her the whole thing before I
sleep tonight.”

“That’s a go then,” said Joe, and they shook
hands on it.

Reggie led the way into the house, and Joe received
a most cordial greeting from Mr. and Mrs.
Varley. He had met them before and they had
always felt most warmly toward him since the
day that he had rescued Mabel from being carried
over a cliff by a runaway horse. All that they
had seen and heard of him since had increased
their favorable estimate of him. And Joe did all
he could to deepen that impression, because some
day he expected to ask these kindly people for one
of their most precious possessions and he wanted
the answer to be the right one.

The dinner was free from all formality, for
despite their wealth, the Varley home life was
as simple and unaffected as Joe’s own home at
Riverside. Mrs. Varley beamed upon him and
told him what she thought of his rescuing the
baby, while Mr. Varley was especially interested
in Joe’s contract and bonus, and his chance of
getting into the World’s Series. It is more than
likely that the shrewd business man already saw[141]
what way the wind was blowing and guessed
pretty well the nature of the question that Joe
hoped some day to ask him. Reggie was gayer
than he had been for a long time, now that he
had determined to share his secret with his sister.
And Mabel, winsome, sweet, bewitching,
worked such havoc with her smiles and eyes and
dimples that poor Joe was more hopelessly enslaved
than ever.

Before he knew it the time had come for him
to go. For just a minute he had her alone while
the rest were in another part of the room. She
was laughing and toying restlessly with a pair of
gloves that rested on the table near which they
stood.

“I want the pay for that paper you took from
me this morning,” he said, assuming a stern air.

“How are you going to get it?” she bantered.
“Perhaps I’m bankrupt.”

“In that case, I’ll take this glove and hold it
as security,” he returned, suiting the action to the
word.

She flushed adorably but made no protest, and
Joe’s fingers trembled as he put the absurdly little
glove in his breast pocket.

Just then a warning “honk, honk!” came from
Reggie’s car, drawn up at the curb outside.

Joe, half in a daze, said goodby to his hosts,
last of all to Mabel. There was no chance for[142]
more than a formal leave taking, but Joe’s heart
again became unruly, for in her eyes he had seen
once more the look she had turned on him in the
train.

The two young men made good time to the
station, which they reached five minutes before
the train from the north rolled in.

“Goodby, old top,” said Reggie, as he shook
his hand in parting. “I’m no end glad that I’ve
had these few hours with you, don’t you know.
You’ve made a new man of me. I feel as though
I’d taken a tonic, by Jove.”

“I’ll send you a bill,” laughed Joe, as he returned
Reggie’s grip. “Be good to yourself, old
man, until I see you again. And don’t forget that
you promised to tell Mabel.”

“I’m game,” replied Reggie, as he stepped back
into his car.

Joe passed through the station and out on the
platform. It was a long train, composed mostly
of Pullmans. Joe knew that the New York Club
had two special cars chartered especially for their
party, and he wondered which they were. He
called to a porter.

“Which cars are the Giants traveling on?” he
asked.

Into the eyes of the porter came a deep respect.
He was a “fan” himself and he sized Joe
up at once as a professional.

[143]

“Right over here, sah. This way, sah.” And
with a deep bow he seized Joe’s bag and led the
way to the first of the two cars located near the
center of the train.

Joe sprang up the steps and passed into the
corridor of the car. A few steps further and he
was in the car proper and surrounded by members
of the Giant team.



[144]




CHAPTER XVII
AWAY DOWN SOUTH


There were perhaps thirty men or thereabouts
in the car. Some were playing cards, others telling
stories, still others skylarking, while a few
were quietly reading or looking out of the windows
at the crowd gathered on the station platform.
There was an utter absence of formality
and restraint, and the prevailing atmosphere was
one of good fellowship. Most of the men were
well but quietly dressed, although a few were
conspicuous by reason of loud ties and silken hose
and flashing diamonds. And as Joe looked at
the latter he grinned as he thought of his old
friend Campbell, the third baseman of the Cardinals,
with his love of gaudy raiment and neckwear
that could be “heard a mile.”

The light of recognition flashed in many eyes
as they lighted on the newcomer, and the next instant
Joe was shaking hands warmly with half a
dozen who crowded around him.

“Joe Matson, as I live!” cried Hughson, the
most famous pitcher in the game. “The man who[145]
made me take water last year in New York. I
sure am glad to see you, Matson. Our boys
are counting on you to get us into the World’s Series
this year.”

“I’ll try to do my share,” laughed Joe, “that
is, if McRae doesn’t keep me warming the bench.
By the way, where is he? I suppose it’s up to me
to report to him right away.”

“He’s talking to one of the big muckamucks in
the next car,” chimed in Barrett, the Giant second
baseman. “How are you, Matson, old man?
You look as fine as silk.”

“Been keeping himself in condition by knocking
crazy men off lumber piles,” laughed “Red”
Curry, the right fielder. “Oh, we’re onto your
curves all right. Read all about it in this morning’s
paper. Was that straight goods or was it
just a reporter’s yarn?”

“The reporter hasn’t let the story lose anything
in the telling,” said Joe. “I did bean the fellow,
but it was an easy enough shot. But for the love
of Pete, boys, don’t hold it against me!”

There was a general laugh, and then Hughson
pushed Joe into a seat and sat down beside him.
In a few minutes they were in an animated conversation
as to the prospects of the team for the
coming season.

Joe could not help contrasting his present reception
with that he had received when he first[146]
broke into the professional ranks. Then he was
just a “busher,” a “rookie,” a nobody who had
his reputation yet to win. The “old hands” had
looked on him patronizingly or contemptuously
and flocked by themselves. He had been made to
feel that he was outside the pale, and some of
the meaner spirits, fearing that he might supplant
them later on, had done everything in their power
to keep him down. Only a young fellow in his
“first season” can know how utterly friendless and
forlorn he is sometimes made to feel.

But in baseball, as in everything else, “nothing
succeeds like success.” Joe had “arrived.” He
had stood the gaff and won his spurs by the hard
ordeal of actual battle. He had faced the best
batters of the country and outguessed them. He
had won his right to a place in the inner circle.
And here he was on a plane of equality and talking
as a friend and comrade with Hughson, the
king of them all.

It was in no spirit of vainglory that Joe recalled
these things. His head was not swelled in
the slightest degree. He knew how precarious
is baseball fame. He knew that the pitcher who
one day had to doff his cap to the applause of the
crowd might, the next time he appeared, be hooted
from the box. But he was profoundly pleased
and gratified that he had so far advanced in his
profession that he had a recognized standing. He[147]
need not now fear that he would not even have a
chance to make good. He would have every opportunity
and his success or failure would depend
on himself alone.

“Yes,” Hughson was saying, “I’ve been looking
at the thing from every angle, and I don’t
see how any team has a license to beat us out.
We’re strong in every position except perhaps
one. I won’t say what that is but leave you to find
it out for yourself. We’ve got rid of some trouble
makers that knocked us out of the pennant last
year and just now we’re like some big happy family.”

“How do you dope out the Chicagos?” asked
Joe. “Don’t you think they’ll give us a harder
fight than any of the other teams?”

“They may,” admitted Hughson, thoughtfully.
“They’ve got a terrific batting combination. They
led the league in that respect last year. But I
think some of their pitchers show signs of slowing
up. I hear that Blaney had to go to Bonesetter
Reese this winter for some trouble in his
salary wing. He’s the most dependable southpaw
they have on the staff and if he goes back on them
they’ll be in a pretty serious pickle.

“They may have picked up some port side
flinger in the draft this winter, but I haven’t heard
of any that are likely to set the river afire. Brennan,
their manager, though, is as foxy as they[148]
make them, and he may have something good
under cover.”

“How do you figure Pittsburgh?” asked Joe.

“Pittsburgh doesn’t scare me much,” was the
answer. “Of course old Wagner is a team in
himself. Isn’t it wonderful how that old slugger
keeps on year in and year out? He’s about the
only man in the whole league that I’m really
afraid of. When he comes up to the plate with
that big wagon tongue of his I always feel that
he’s more likely to get my number than I am to
get his. But he can’t do the work of a whole ball
team after all, and the rest of the nine don’t figure
out so very strong, to my way of thinking.
They’re sure to be in the first division, but I think
that lets them out. To tell the truth, I’m more
sweet on Boston’s chances than any one else’s, outside
of our own.”

“Boston!” ejaculated Joe in surprise. “I didn’t
think they had a look in for the flag.”

“Don’t fool yourself,” returned Hughson.
“Believe me, that team will bear a lot of watching.
They’ve got Rawlings for a manager and
he’s one of the most cagey men in the game. He
can take a ‘busher’ and develop him into a star
quicker than any man I ever saw outside of McRae.
I know they say he has a team of cast-offs,
but he’s welding them into a winning combination.
His weakest spot was the keystone bag, but he’s[149]
made a deal with Chicago this winter and got
Ebers, the most brainy man who ever played second
base. I’ll bet he has the star infield of the
league before the year is out.”

“The Giants have good cause to remember
Ebers,” laughed Joe.

“You bet we have,” returned Hughson, grimly.
“It was his quick thinking that knocked us out of
the championship the year that Burkett forgot
to touch second. Oh, maybe we weren’t sore that
day when we saw our chance to get into the
World’s Series go glimmering. We lost at least
fifty thousand dollars that afternoon by that one
misplay. Poor Burkett himself felt so bad about
it that the boys were afraid he was going to lose
his mind. The gloom was so thick about the
clubhouse that day that you couldn’t cut it with a
knife.”

Just then a thick-set man of medium height
came through the car and stopped at their seat.

“How are you, Matson?” he asked, pleasantly.

Joe was on his feet in an instant and his hand,
outstretched in greeting, grasped that of McRae,
the far-famed leader of the Giants.



[150]




CHAPTER XVIII
IN HARNESS


Hughson got up and relinquished his seat to
McRae.

“Sit down here,” he said. “I’ve been chinning
with Matson until he’s black in the face and he’ll
be glad to get rid of me.”

He grinned at Joe’s laughing disclaimer and
made his way up the car while McRae slipped into
the vacant seat.

“There goes one of the finest men that ever
stepped in shoe leather,” he remarked, as his eye
followed Hughson’s tall form up the aisle.

“Isn’t he a prince?” said Joe, eagerly. “You
don’t know whether to admire him most as man
or player.”

“He’s just about a hundred per cent. in both,”
agreed McRae. “He’s been the mainstay of my
team for the last ten years. There isn’t enough
money in the league to buy him from the Giants.
He’s the only man on the team who doesn’t have
to go through the regular schedule in the training
camp. I let him come along just as he likes,[151]
for I know he’ll be fit as a fiddle when the season
opens. I don’t mind telling you that I consulted
him as to getting you from St. Louis, and it was
largely on his advice that I put through the deal.”

“Even his opponents like and respect him,” said
Joe. “In swinging round the circuit last year I
never heard any one say a word against him.
They all agree that he’s a credit to the game.”

“Well, now, how about yourself?” asked McRae,
as his keen eye swept over Joe’s athletic
form. “You look as though you had been taking
care of yourself this winter. Some of my players
are hog fat when they report in the spring, but I
should judge that you wouldn’t have to lose more
than five pounds or so to get down to your best
playing weight.”

“Just about that, I guess,” replied Joe. “I’m
weighing about one hundred and seventy now, and
I always feel most fit when I tip the scales at one
hundred and sixty-five.”

“Been doing anything outside the rings and
dumb-bells?” McRae inquired.

“I’ve done just enough pitching to keep my
arm supple,” answered Joe. “We have a good
gymnasium in our town and there have always
been enough of the boys around to catch me when
I felt like doing a little twirling.”

“How about that bonus clause in the contract?”
asked the manager, with a twinkle in his eye.[152]
“Are you going to do us out of that extra thousand?”

“Am I going to get a chance to pitch thirty
games?” laughed Joe.

McRae grinned.

“I can see that you’ve been figuring on it,” he
rejoined. “It’s too early in the season to make
any promises. A good deal will depend upon how
my veterans come along. But I don’t mind telling
you that I’m going to figure you as one of
my first-string pitchers and give you your regular
turn in the box. The rest will depend on you. I
play no favorites. I’m out to win from the first
crack of the bat, and it’s the man who wins his
games that makes a hit with me. Whether you’ve
been ten years in the league or one doesn’t cut
any ice.

“I don’t need to ask you whether you drink or
not,” he added. “I found out all about that before
I put through the deal. Besides, I can tell
from looking at you that you’re no booze fighter.
I won’t stand for dissipation on my team. I’m
pretty lucky this year as far as that goes. A
couple of the boys are a little wobbly in the matter
of the wet goods, but I think I can make them
walk the chalk line until the playing season is
over. If they don’t, I’ll trade or sell them. But
the rest of the men don’t give me any trouble in
that way.”

[153]

“You won’t have to worry about me on that
score,” Joe assured him. “If I fall down, it will
only be because I haven’t it in me to win, it
won’t be because I’ve been wrestling with the
demon Rum.”

“That’s good,” laughed McRae. “Stick to
that and I’ll bet you win your bonus. I’m going
to send over one of my rookies to talk to you. I
think he has the stuff in him to make a good
pitcher and I want you to help and encourage him
all you can. He played last year on the Princeton
team and made such a good showing that one of
our scouts recommended that we give him a trial.
But he’s only an amateur and of course he’s got an
awful lot to learn. Boost him along all you can.

“By the way,” said McRae, as he rose to leave,
“I want to congratulate you on the job you did
with that crazy man. It was a nifty bit of work.”

“That thing keeps chasing me everywhere,”
laughed Joe. “I can’t get away from it.”

“It’ll make good advertising,” laughed McRae.
“There’ll be a big crowd out when you pitch your
first game to see the man who can throw a snowball
as well as he can a baseball. But what tickled
me when I read about it was the quick thinking it
showed. That’s what I want on my team. I want
a player to be quick in the head as well as in the
feet. I haven’t any use for ivory domes.”

It was the first time that Joe had ever had[154]
a chance to have a real talk with the famous manager.
They had known each other, of course,
by sight, and had exchanged occasional nods when
they met. And, as Joe had whimsically told his
folks, there had been an interchange of chaff in
the heat of battle. But now for the first time Joe
had a chance to judge of the man on whom his
fate would so largely depend during the coming
season, and his impression had been a favorable
one.

He was familiar with McRae’s record as a
player before he had become a manager. He was
an intensely aggressive man. Aggressiveness
stood out all over him like “the quills on the fretful
porcupine.” On the field he was scrappy and
fearless and fought like a tiger for every bit of
advantage that might help his team to win. He
was a terror to umpires and had probably been
ordered off the field more times than any manager
in the league.

But though he carried his zeal too far at times,
and had made many enemies, he had many good
qualities that offset his defects. He was generous
and fair to his men and protected them against
public clamor, when they had incurred the rage of
the fickle fans. He kept Burkett, after that
ghastly error at second that had lost a championship.
Twice he had lost the World’s Series, owing
to a muff by the center fielder at the crucial point[155]
in the game. But he knew that the man had tried
to do his best and he had refused to release him.
He was a hard man but he tried to be a just one,
and Joe felt sure that he would have every chance
to make good under his management.

A tall young fellow came down the car and
paused beside the seat.

“Mr. Matson?” he asked.

Joe nodded pleasantly.

“My name is Barclay,” went on the newcomer.
“Mr. McRae suggested that I come over and have
a talk with you.”

“Oh, yes,” said Joe, as he rose and grasped
his hand. “You’re from Princeton, aren’t you?”

“Yes,” said Barclay. “And you’re from Yale,
I understand.”

“That’s right,” replied Joe. “How’s the
tiger?”

“Fine,” returned Barclay. “How’s the bulldog?”

They laughed and sat down together. The ice
was broken and they were soon talking like old
friends. The traditional rivalries of their two
colleges gave them an endless number of things
to talk about. Joe found him very congenial and
intelligent, and Barclay on his part was delighted
to find himself on a friendly footing with a college
man, who had broken into the big league and
“made good.” He had been feeling rather shaky[156]
and forlorn, as is the usual custom of “rookies,”
and Joe, remembering his own experience, did his
best to help him shake off that feeling.
So chummy did they become that Joe proposed
that they room together during their stay in the
training camp. Barclay jumped eagerly at the
chance and on a word to the manager the matter
was so arranged.

In due time the train rolled into Marlin
Springs and the pilgrims disembarked, glad to
stretch their legs after the long journey. A big
crowd of citizens and officials of the town were on
hand to give them a boisterous greeting, and the
village band struck up a triumphal march as the
band of athletes moved on to the hotel. They
made a splendid picture of physical manhood.
After the long winter they were eager for the
fray. They were like so many greyhounds straining
at the leash.

“Look pretty good, don’t they?” remarked
McRae to Hughson. “But it isn’t a circumstance
to the way they’ll look when I get through with
their training and have them ready to take the
field.”



[157]




CHAPTER XIX
DRIVING THEM HARD


The next morning dawned soft and balmy.
The air was full of the fragrance of flowers and
musical with the singing of birds. To Joe who
two days before had been in a region of snow
and ice where winter still reigned supreme, it almost
seemed as though he had been carried by the
carpet of Solomon to some different clime and
country.

“Great Scott, but this is regular baseball
weather!” he cried, as he looked out of the window.
“Get a move on, Jim, and let’s get outdoors
as soon as possible. It’s a crime to waste
any minute of a morning like this.”

Barclay, thus adjured, scrambled out of bed and
they hurried into their clothes.

“What time was it that McRae wanted us to be
ready to start for the park this morning?” asked
Jim.

“Nine o’clock sharp, and it’s after seven now.
We won’t have more than time to get our breakfast
and get into our baseball togs.”

[158]

They went down to the dining room where a
special section had been reserved for the team.
Quite a number were already eating the excellent
breakfast and others soon straggled in until
all were accounted for. There was a general air
of hilarity, especially among the older members
of the team. The rookies, however, were on
edge with nervousness in anticipation of the coming
ordeal that meant so much to them. They
gulped down their meal in a preoccupied way and
conversation lagged in their corner.

By nine o’clock all had changed into their uniforms
and had assembled in front of the hotel.

“Where’s the bus?” asked one of the drafted
men.

There was a roar of laughter from the old
timers.

“The only bus you’ll have will be those two legs
of yours,” chuckled Curry. “You’ll start right
in now, my bucko, to learn what they were made
for.”

The abashed rookie subsided, and just then
McRae put in his appearance.

“All here, eh?” he remarked, as his keen eye
ran over the group. “Come along then and we’ll
jog down to the Park.”

The “jog” proved to be a run of two miles
or more. It did not inconvenience Joe to any
extent because he was already in fine fettle, but[159]
many of the others were winded by the time they
reached the gates. But pride kept them from
falling behind and none of them cared to take a
chance with the rasping tongue of McRae. Besides
he was only asking them to do what he was
willing to do himself and they soon learned that
he worked just as hard to get into condition as
any “busher” on the team.

Joe tingled clear to the finger tips as he passed
through the entrance and his eye fell on the diamond.
For months he had been hungry for baseball.
The passion for the game was in his blood,
as it has to be if one is going to be a star player.
He longed for the music of bat meeting ball. He
felt like a colt let out to pasture in the spring.

“Go easy now, boys,” warned McRae. “Don’t
get up too much steam all at once. You pitchers,
especially, cut out all curves for the first few days.
Just straight ones and not too fast at that. You
don’t want to do anything more now than just
limber up.”

There were a number of bats and balls in the
little clubhouse and these were brought quickly
into service. The majority of the men scattered
out into the field, while others, standing near the
plate, batted up flies. Others took the infield positions
and passed the ball around the bases.
The pitchers paired off with the catchers and
tossed up a few easy ones, seldom cutting loose a[160]
fast one except at times when the temptation became
too hard to resist. McRae wandered around
the field watching the action of the different players,
putting in a word of criticism or advice here
and there, but devoting himself especially to the
new men from whom he hoped to cull a certain
amount of “big league timber.” No one knew
better than he how hard this was to get. He had
thirty or more prospects on hand to develop, but
if he really got two or three first-class men out
of that number he would feel amply repaid for all
the trouble and expense.

At noon they ran back to the hotel for dinner
and returned for a two-hour session in the afternoon.
They felt pretty tired when night came
and they slept like logs. The next morning all
were lame and sore and there were demands for
arnica and a massage. But McRae believed that
one is cured by “the hair of the dog that bites
him,” and he insisted on the two sessions just the
same although he limited the time for each. By
the end of a week most of the soreness had disappeared
and the men were as spry as kittens.

“Now,” McRae announced one morning,
“we’re going to have some real practice. I’m
going to split the squad into two teams. One will
be called the Giants and the other the Yannigans.
We’ll only play six inning games at the start, but
I want them to be for blood. Most of the regulars[161]
will be on the Giant team, but I give you old
timers fair warning that if any of the Yannigans
play better ball than you do they’ll get your job.”

To equalize matters somewhat, he let the Yannigans
have one of the first string pitchers, but
for the rest they had to stand or fall on their merits.
And the Yannigans soon proved that they
were not to be despised. They wanted to show
McRae what they could do, and they “worked
their heads off” to defeat their rivals. More than
once they had that satisfaction, although in the
majority of games, as was to be expected, they
came off second best.

The pitching staff too was now sent through
its paces. Robson, the famous old time catcher
of the Orioles and a warm friend of McRae’s,
had special charge of this work. For developing
young pitchers he had no equal in the country.

He had a tip from McRae to pay especial attention
to young Barclay, of whom the manager
had great hopes. Jim had a good fast ball and
a fair variety of curves. But during his last year
at Princeton he had been coached by one of the
greatest spit ball pitchers in the country and had
developed a very effective form of that puzzling
delivery.

Neither McRae nor Robson favored the
“moist” ball overmuch, as they thought it took
too much out of the twirler and put too big a[162]
strain on his pitching arm. Chesebro, who discovered
it and Ed Walsh of the Chicagos who
perfected it, had both been worn out before their
time. Still, as no other pitcher on the Giants
used it and Barclay was willing to take the chance,
they were not averse to letting him show what
he could do. And Robson soon had to admit that
what he could do was “plenty.” Before long, it
had become clear that, whoever might be sent
back to the bushes, Jim would not be among
them.

As for Joe himself, he had never been in finer
shape at the beginning of a season. He had
“speed to burn.” The ball shot over the plate,
like a bullet from a gun. His control was nearly
perfect. He made the ball fairly “talk.” He won
a game from the strong Houston team with comparative
ease and saved another from Waco after
Markwith had been batted out of the box.

“You’re playing like a house afire, Joe,” said
Jim, after this last game. “I’ll bet you’ve got
a rabbit’s foot concealed about you somewhere.”

“Rabbit’s foot be hanged,” laughed Joe. “I
know a trick worth two of that.”

Could Joe have referred to a dainty little glove
that nestled in his pocket?

In what estimation Joe was held by the “powers
that be” may be inferred from a scrap of
conversation that passed between McRae and[163]
Robson as the team was working its way north,
after training days were over, to open the season
at the Polo Grounds.

“What do you think of Matson, Robbie, old
boy?” asked McRae.

“What do I think?” said Robson, emphatically.
“I think he’s going to be a second Hughson.”



[164]




CHAPTER XX
A TEST OF NERVE


“How are you feeling, Joe?” asked Jim, as the
men were dressing in the clubhouse, preparatory
to going on the field for the first game of the
championship race.

“Like a fighting cock,” answered Joe. “How
are you?”

“A bit shaky,” confessed Jim. “My heart keeps
coming up in my throat and I have to keep swallowing
it all the time.”

“You’ve got nothing to worry about,” chaffed
Joe. “Neither you nor I will have anything to do
today but root for the rest of the boys. That’s
a moral certainty.”

“You can’t sometimes most always tell,” quoted
Jim. “Nothing is certain in baseball.”

“No,” admitted Joe, as he adjusted his belt.
“But it’s a cinch that Hughson will pitch today.
He always does in the first game. An opening
day without Hughson in the box would be like
the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out.”

“Gee!” interrupted Larry Barrett as he glanced[165]
through the door in the direction of the stands.
“Take a squint at that crowd! I’ll bet all New
York is here today.”

It was the great day of the season, the day
to which the hungry baseball enthusiasts in the
metropolis had looked forward all through the
winter and early spring. For days the fans had
been in an ever increasing fever of excitement.
The papers had been full of predictions as to the
chances of the New Yorks for the flag. There
had been pictures of the team individually and
in groups together with their fielding and batting
averages. There had been rosy stories of
the way they had been “breaking fences” in the
training camp, and there were hints that McRae
had uncovered one or two “phenoms” who would
make the rooters sit up and take notice. The
whole population of the city that had a drop of
red blood in its veins was on tiptoe with expectation.

The day had dawned clear and bright, and for
hours before the time for the game to start the
trains and trolleys had been disgorging their
crowds at the gates. The far famed Polo
Grounds had never been in more superb condition.
The diamond was like so much soft green
velvet. The white markings of the base lines
were dazzling by way of contrast with the green.
Boxes, grandstands and bleachers were filled to[166]
overflowing with a hilarious, good-natured crowd,
that was out for a good time and determined to
have it. Long before the time for starting the
game, it became evident that “ground rules”
would have to be established, making a hit into
the crowd only good for two bases, no matter how
far it went.

The Boston “Braves” were to cross bats with
the Giants, and there was a keen curiosity in the
crowd to see how “Rawling’s cast-offs” would
shape up, although few gave them more than an
outside chance to win.

“Line up now, boys, for the grand march,”
sang out Robson, as he bustled into the clubhouse.

The team came out and got into line, McRae
and Hughson leading. The Bostons joined them
and the two teams came down to the plate amid
an uproar of boisterous applause. The leaders
clasped hands at the plate, the movie men, who
were there in droves, set their machines going, and
then the members of the two teams broke ranks
and scattered for preliminary practice. This was
snappy and lightning fast, and “stunts” were
pulled off by both teams that brought the crowds
to their feet.

Then the bell rang for the game to begin. The
mayor of the city threw out the first ball. Hughson
caught it and returned it to the mayor’s wife[167]
to keep as a souvenir, after first writing his autograph
on it at her request. Then he took his
place in the box, the first Boston batter came to
the plate, the umpire cried “Play ball!” and the
championship race was on in earnest.

Joe and Jim had warmed up together with the
other pitchers and now sat on the bench together
with the rest of the New York team who were
not actually playing in the game.

“Watch that drop. Wasn’t it a beauty?” commented
Joe enthusiastically, as the first ball
eluded the batter’s savage swing and fell with
a thud into the catcher’s glove.

“It was a lulu, all right,” agreed Jim. “If
that’s a sample of what the old boy has in stock
today, they’ll break their backs going after them.”

The first man proved an easy victim by the
“strike out route,” the second dribbled a slow
roller to the box that Hughson got to first in
plenty of time, and the third succumbed to a
high foul that Mylert, the catcher, gathered in
close to the right of first base. It was a quick
inning and Hughson was greeted with cheers as
he walked in.

“That’s the way, Hughie, old boy!”

“You’ve got them buffaloed!”

“They’re dead ones already!”

“They can’t touch you!”

But the Boston pitcher soon showed that he[168]
was also in fine fettle, and though the New Yorks
got a man to first on a fumble by the third baseman,
he got no further and the inning ended as
a scoreless tie.

For three more innings the same state of things
persisted, although the Giants gathered three hits
while only one had been made off Hughson.

“We’re getting on to him though,” said Barrett,
as he came back to the bench, referring to
Leonard, the Boston pitcher. “He’s got a high,
fast one that he winds around your neck, but his
curves aren’t such a much. About the sixth inning
we’ll start in to plug him.”

But the “Braves” had views of their own on
“plugging,” and by one of the “breaks” of the
game they were the first to score.

It was in the first part of the fifth inning. Willis,
their first man up, had got to first through an
infield hit that took a high bound just as Barrett
had set himself for it and went over his head.
The next player lay down a perfect sacrifice bunt
which Denton, the Giant third baseman, got in
time to put his man out at first though he could
not prevent Willis reaching second. Hughson
put on steam and struck out the next batter on
three pitched balls, and the crowd breathed more
easily. But the glorious uncertainty that makes
the game what it is was shown when the Boston
right fielder sent a beauty to left just inside the[169]
third base line that scored Willis although the
batter by quick fielding was held at first.

The Boston rooters went wild while the New
Yorkers sat glum and silent. Their opponents
had scored “first blood” and in as close a game
as that one promised to be that lone run loomed
up like a mountain.

“Never mind, old man,” said McRae to Hughson,
as the latter walked in after the third man
had been caught stealing. “The game’s young
yet. We’ll see that run and go them one better.”

But the seventh inning came with the Bostons
still in the lead.

“The lucky seventh,” was the cry that went
through the stands. “All stretch!” And the
fans went through the time-honored exercise while
they whooped it up for their favorites.

“Now Larry!” they yelled as Barrett strode
up to the plate, “hit it a mile! Show them where
you live!”

Larry, who had led the National League in
hitting the previous year, tapped both heels for
luck, squared himself and glared fiercely at the
pitcher.

That individual glared back and sent the ball
hurtling over the plate. It chanced to be a low,
fast one, the kind that Larry doted on. He
caught it square on the end of his bat. It went[170]
screaming out over the center fielder’s head. On
a clear field it would have been an easy home
run, but in accordance with the ground rules it
only counted for a two bagger. Larry perched
on second with a broad grin on his face while the
stands went crazy.

“We’ve got him now!” cried McRae. “He’s
going up in the air.”

The next batter put up a high fly to right,
which was caught after a hard run, Barrett making
third on the out.

The next man up was Red Curry. He looked
so formidable as he swung his bat that the pitcher
thought it advisable to pass him to first on four
wide ones.

“He’s getting rattled!” yelled McRae. “We’ve
got his goat!”

But the soundness of the pitcher’s judgment
was vindicated a moment later when the next
batter, Lewis, hit into a force play, so skilfully
managed that while a man was out at second
Larry was held at third. The crowd groaned as
they saw the vision of a run go glimmering, but
roared with delight a moment later when Becker
scorched a hot one between second and third,
bringing in Larry with the tying run. And their
joy became delirium when Byrnes cracked a beauty
to right and Lewis got home by a great slide to
the plate.

[171]

The Giant players threw their caps in the air
and Joe and Jim hugged each other in their glee.

“We’re in the lead now,” chortled Joe, “and
we can trust old Hughson to hold them down.”

The Boston pitcher pulled himself together and
made the next batter put up a high foul that was
caught by the first baseman, making the third out.
But nobody cared. The Giants were ahead and
there were only two innings to go.

In the Boston half of the eighth, the first man
went out on a fly to center and the second
“fanned.” The third hit a teasing bounder to
the left of the box. Hughson made a great try,
but in doing so he wrenched his knee badly. He
got his man at first but when he came in to the
bench he was limping and was evidently in great
pain. McRae, Robson and the trainer gathered
round him and massaged the knee vigorously.

“Do you think you can stay it out, Hughson?”
asked McRae with great anxiety. “There’s only
one more inning you know.”

“I’ll try to,” was the answer. “But in the
meantime you’d better warm up another pitcher.”

McRae and Robson had a hurried conference.

“I’d put in Markwith,” said McRae, “but these
Bostons are death on southpaws.”

“Try Matson,” suggested Robson. “I noticed
he was going great guns in practice.”

“It’s a big risk before this crowd for his first[172]
time out,” said McRae, dubiously. “But we’ll
have to chance it.”

He hurried over to Joe.

“Get out and warm up, Matson,” he said,
briefly. “I may have to put you in for the ninth.”

Joe’s head whirled. To follow the great Hughson!
And before this record-breaking crowd!

Then he took a grip on himself.

“All right,” he answered, and taking Weldon,
one of the Giant reserve catchers, he went off
toward the further end of the stand and began
warming up.

But the inning was very short, as the Boston
pitcher was on his mettle and retired the side in
one-two-three order. Long before Joe had really
warmed up, the New Yorks took the field.

Hughson went out gamely to the box, trying to
hide his limp as much as possible. But the Boston
players recognized that this was their chance.
One run would tie and two would win. It was
now or never, and their heavy batters were coming
up.

Hughson, with all his pluck, could not perform
miracles. He tried to put all his skill and
cunning into his pitching, but his wounded knee
refused to back him up. There were men on first
and second, with none out, when he signaled to
McRae.

“It’s no use, Mac,” he said, as the latter came[173]
over to him. “I can’t bear my weight on my foot
so as to get any power behind the ball. We’ve
still got a chance if you put in Matson.”

So Joe, at a signal from the manager, took
up the pitcher’s burden with two men on bases
and none out, while the Boston coachers danced
up and down on the coaching lines, yelling like
mad men and doing all they could to rattle him.



[174]




CHAPTER XXI
MAKING GOOD


“Ladies and gentlemen!” roared the umpire,
taking off his cap, “Matson now pitching for the
New Yorks!”

There was a yell of applause from the packed
stands to greet the newcomer. There had been
a great deal of curiosity stirred up by the newspaper
accounts of Joe’s exploit with the madman,
and the crowd was in a friendly mood. Besides,
they realized that they ought to encourage him
at this critical time when the game hung in the
balance. So they cheered him loyally, though
not many thought he could win with such a handicap.

Some of them remembered, however, how this
same young pitcher had tamed their own Giants
the last game of the previous season and realized
that there was still a fighting chance.

Succeeding the first wild yell, a deathlike silence
settled over the stands as Joe wound up for the
first ball.

Straight as an arrow it darted toward the plate,[175]
breaking into a wide outcurve as the batter lunged
at it.



  

IT DARTED TOWARD THE PLATE, BREAKING INTO A WIDE OUTCURVE.


“Strike one!” called the umpire, and a cheer
went up.

The next two were balls at which the batter
declined to “bite.”

“Strike two!” called the umpire as the next
one cut the plate.

The next was a ball.

“He’s in the hole now!” yelled the Boston
coachers. “He can’t get it over. He’s going up.”

Joe did his best to get the next one over the
rubber, but he had not warmed up enough yet
to get perfect control, and the umpire waved the
batter down to first. He ran down, laughing derisively,
while his comrades moved up to second
and third.

“All over now but the shouting,” was the cry
that went up from the enemy’s coaching lines.
“We don’t need to hit the ball. Just leave him
alone and he’ll win the game for us.”

Larry came in from second, ostensibly to consult
with Joe, but really to give him a moment’s
breathing space.

“Keep your nerve, old man,” he counseled.
“We’ll get them yet. We’re all with you.”

“I know it, Larry,” said Joe, gratefully.

“Play ball!” yelled the Bostons.

“Write him a letter!”

[176]

“Hire a hall!”

But Larry was too old a bird to mind their
jeers and he took his time in getting back to his
position.

Joe knew that the next batsman, depending
upon his being wild, would not attempt to strike
at the first balls served but would try to “wait him
out.” So he put two perfect strikes across the
plate. The batter grew serious and set himself
for the next which he figured would also be a
strike. But Joe outguessed him and fed him a
slow one that he frantically struck at before it
reached the plate.

“You’re out!” called the umpire, and the stands
broke into thunderous applause.

Still, there were three on bases and a long fly
to the outfield, even if caught, would probably
bring the man in from third with the tying run.
At all costs Joe must keep the ball on the ground
within the limits of the infield where a play could
be made for the plate.

He measured the next Boston man carefully
as he came to the plate. He was the heaviest
batter on the team, and his mates begged him vociferously
to “line it out.”

“It only takes one to do it.”

“Give it a ride!”

“Hit it on the seam!”

The batter shook his bat at Joe.

[177]

“Put it over if you know how,” he jibed, “and
I’ll kill it.”

He was a trifle less confident, however, when
a speedy one cut the plate breast high, missing
his bat by six inches.

“That’s no way to kill a ball,” taunted Joe.

The batter was trying to think up a retort,
when Joe, without waiting to wind up, slipped
one over before he was expecting it.

“Strike two!” called the umpire.

“Clever work, Matson!” called out McRae delightedly,
while a tempest of cheering swept the
stands.

The next one was a low outcurve that the batter
reached for and connected with. It shot like
a bullet straight at Joe, but above his head. If
his team had had a big lead, Joe would have
dodged and left it to his fielders, for it was almost
deadly to face it at that distance. But he
leaped high in the air and it stuck in his glove.
All the men on bases, thinking it was a sure hit,
were legging it for home. Like a flash Joe turned
and shot it down to third, completing a beautiful
double play.

Three men were out, the game was over and
the Giants had won by a score of two to one!

The lightning like quickness of the play had
dumbfounded spectators and players alike. Only
for an instant, however. Then a roar went up[178]
that could have been heard for a mile, and the
crowd swept down from the stands. Joe saw
them coming and made a break for the clubhouse.
He got away from the grandstands but the bleachers
intercepted him, and for the last twenty yards
he had to force his way through a surging mob
who tried to grab his hand or clap him on the
shoulder or in a hundred ways tried to express
their appreciation of his work. It was with a
sigh of relief that he found himself at last within
the welcome shelter of the club’s quarters.

His comrades were not far behind him and
came tumbling in pell-mell, filled with delight at
having the game snatched from the fire at the
last moment.

“Gee!” said Larry. “That was a close call!
I never saw a prettier double!”

“You’re some pitcher, Joe!” cried Red Curry.
“I thought we were goners sure with those three
men on the bags.”

McRae and Robson hurried in, their features
one broad grin.

“You saved the day, Matson!” exclaimed the
former. “I admit I was a little scared when you
went in with such odds against you. But you
stood the gaff all right.”

“We’ve got the jump on the other fellows by
copping the first game,” said Robson. “It’s a
great thing to get away to a running start. It[179]
puts heart and courage into the team, and that
certainly would have been a hard game to lose.”

“It was Hughson’s game after all,” protested
Joe. “It was his magnificent pitching that held
them down to one run up to the ninth. All I
had to do was to hold them there.”

“Of course we know what Hughson is,” said
McRae, “but we weren’t quite so sure what you
would be when brought face to face with a pinch.
All I ask you to do is to keep up the way you’ve
started.”

Joe would not have been human if he had
not felt jubilant at these words of praise from the
head of the team. But it did not make him lose
his head. He knew that the same tongue that
gave him credit now would be quite as ready to
“skin him alive” if he failed to do his best. If
“eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,” Joe
knew that it was also the price of success in his
chosen profession. No baseball player can rely
on the great things he did yesterday. He must
be prepared to do them today and tomorrow
also. The same public that today had overwhelmed
him with applause might in a few days
be demanding that he be taken out of the box.
And knowing this, Joe resolved that he would
never give less than the very best that was in him.
He would have his bad days&mdash;every pitcher has&mdash;but
it would never be from lack of trying.

[180]

But whatever the future might have in store
for him, today at least was his. The honey of
success was on his tongue and it was very sweet.
He had made good in his first game in the metropolis.
In the words of Robson, he had “got
off to a running start.”

He whistled blithely as after his shower and
rubdown, he got into his clothes and, accompanied
by Jim, passed out into the street.



[181]




CHAPTER XXII
A HOT CAMPAIGN


“Well, Joe, the Giants trimmed the Braves
good and proper,” chuckled Jim, for the twentieth
time referring to the thing that loomed largest in
the minds of both.

“We certainly did, but we must remember that
‘one swallow doesn’t make a summer!’” answered
Joe. “We’ll have our own scalps taken many a
time before the season’s over. As it was, we
had a mighty close call. Those ‘cast-offs,’ as they
call them, played like champions, and perhaps
Hughson was right when he said that they were
the ones we would have to look out for.”

“Perhaps so,” assented Jim. “But I’m rather
sweet on Chicago for the runner-up. I see by
the bulletin board that they whipped Cincinnati
by twelve to three. Those fellows are terrors
with the stick. You’ll have to do your prettiest
when you stack up against them, Joe.”

“None of the teams are going to be easy meat,”
was the answer. “They’re better balanced than
they’ve been for several years. There isn’t one[182]
of them that can’t be figured to have a chance.”

“That’s the way I like to see them,” declared
Jim. “There’s no fun in having one or two teams
out in the lead so far that there’s no chance of
the others catching up.”

“I wonder whether that trouble with his knee
is going to lay Hughson up,” remarked Joe, after
they had taken their seats in the elevated train
and were being whirled to their hotel downtown.
“It would be a pretty serious thing for the nine
if he were out of the running. He’s the backbone
of the team.”

“I don’t think it’s going to be anything serious,”
said Jim. “I overheard Farley, the trainer, telling
McRae that Hughson would be as well as
ever in a week.”

“I suppose Markwith will go in tomorrow,”
remarked Joe.

“Quite likely,” assented Jim. “Although those
Bostons just eat up left-handed pitching. I
shouldn’t wonder if McRae would put you in
again. You only pitched one inning and I don’t
suppose that has tired you much.”

“Not a bit,” replied Joe. “Still, I think that
Bugs Hartley is more likely to be called on. He
warmed up well in practice before the game and
seems to be in prime condition. Besides, he might
feel slighted if McRae doesn’t start him. He
seemed sore when I was called on today.”

[183]

“Did you notice that, too?” asked Jim. “I
thought he acted mighty queer in the clubhouse
this afternoon. All of the other fellows were
tickled to death that we won, but Hartley seemed
to have a grouch on. You don’t suppose he’s
small enough to grudge you your victory, do
you?”

“I should hope not,” answered Joe. “I don’t
see why he should. I’ve gone out of my way to
be pleasant to him. He’s an odd fellow, but he’s
a mighty good pitcher, and I wish him all the luck
in the world.”

“Bugs” Hartley, as he had been dubbed on account
of his erratic ways, had been on the Giant
team for two seasons. As long as he took care
of himself, he ranked among the best pitchers of
the league. But he had a weakness for liquor and
other forms of dissipation, and McRae had been
sorely tried in his attempts to keep him within the
bounds of discipline. Several times Hartley had
left the team in the lurch by going off on sprees
just when they most needed his services. But he
had pleaded so eagerly for another chance, when
threatened with dismissal, that McRae, though
with many misgivings, had kept him on his staff
in the hope that he might ultimately reform him.

He had an intensely jealous nature and had
been much disgruntled when the deal had been
put through that had brought Joe to the Giants.[184]
He figured that now McRae would feel so strong
in the box that he would be more ready to dispense
with his own services the next time he should
kick over the traces. And the triumph of the
newcomer that afternoon of the first game had
been gall and wormwood to Hartley.

“I wonder when I’m going to get my chance or
whether I’m going to get any chance at all,”
mused Jim.

“You’ll get your chance in good time all right,”
declared Joe, confidently. “You’re a fixture on
the team. Don’t worry about that.”

“I’m not a bit sure of that,” said Jim, dubiously.
“McRae hasn’t told me so yet, and perhaps
my head will fall into the basket when the
time comes for him to reduce the team to the
twenty-two man limit.”

“I’ve had a straight tip from Hughson that
McRae means to keep you,” said Joe. “So make
your mind easy on that score. As for your chance
to play, you’ll have to be patient. You may have
to sit on the bench for a while, but then again
you may be in harness in a month. The only
thing to do is to go ahead with your practice for
all that you’re worth and saw wood.”

The campaign that opened that day at the Polo
Grounds proved to be a hot one. During the first
three weeks the Eastern clubs played among themselves,
and the Western clubs did the same. Following[185]
the Braves at the Polo Grounds came the
Phillies and the Brooklyn Superbas, and then
the Giants in their turn visited the grounds of
their opponents. The games were bitterly contested,
for this year the Eastern teams were
scheduled to go West before the Westerners invaded
the East, and each was eager to start on the
trip with a substantial lead already gained. It
was nip and tuck, with now one team, now another
at the head of the column, but the net result
was that when the teams took the train for
the West the Giants were in the lead by a narrow
margin of only half a game over the Phillies,
while the other two were bunched close up.

“I’m glad anyway that we make the first trip
West instead of it being the other way,” remarked
Joe to Jim, as they dropped into their seats in
the Pullman that was to take them to St. Louis,
where they were to open. “We’ll have the big
advantage of winding up the season on our own
grounds, and in a close race such as this promises
to be, that may make all the difference in the
world.”

“Right you are,” answered Jim. “And here’s
hoping that our last game at the Polo Grounds
may end like the first&mdash;in victory.”



[186]




CHAPTER XXIII
AN EVIL INFLUENCE


It was with a thrill that Joe gathered up his
hand-baggage when the train rolled into the Union
Station at St. Louis. Here was the city where
he had first broken into the big league, where he
had fought his first battles and won his spurs in
fast company. If he had not played on the Cardinals,
he might not have attracted the attention
of McRae and been traded to the Giants; if he
had not been on the Giants he would not have had
his present chance of getting into the World’s
Series; if he should get into that dreamed of Series
there would be that neat little sum with which
to start housekeeping&mdash;and here Joe put his hand
into his breast pocket to touch that little glove.

His pleasant musings were interrupted by a
vigorous clap on the shoulder and the sound of
a well-remembered voice.

“Hello, Joe, old man!” it said, and the next
instant Joe was shaking hands with good old Rad
Chase, who had come down to meet him.

“Rad, old boy, there’s no man on earth I’d[187]
rather meet,” he declared, after introducing him
to Jim. “How are things going in little old St.
Louis?”

“Fine as silk,” grinned Rad. “The only thing
we’re missing is the eminent Mr. Matson on our
team. If we had him, we’d make a mighty strong
bid for the flag. I see that you’ve been up to
your old tricks in New York. They’re beginning
to put your name and Hughson’s together when
they talk of the Giants’ chances to win the pennant.”

“You mustn’t believe all you hear,” laughed
Joe. “But I’m glad to see that you’re cleaning up
things here in the West. Those three straight
from Chicago last week was some ball playing.”

“Let’s hope it isn’t only a spurt,” said Rad.
“We need some Giant scalps in our wigwam just
now. About three out of four will do.”

“Guess again,” laughed Joe. “But tell me how
are the old boys? How is Campbell? Has he
got any new neckties this year?”

“Has he?” grinned Rad. “He showed me one
yesterday that had a regular delirium-tremens effect.
I’m afraid to go to sleep for fear I’ll dream
of it.”

“Come up to the hotel with us and have dinner,”
invited Joe, as he signaled for a taxi.

“You bet I will,” replied Rad, heartily. “I’ve
got a hundred things I want to talk to you about[188]
and now that I’ve got my hooks on you, I’m not
going to let go in a hurry.”

They had a royal meal and a delightful evening
together, and about ten o’clock Rad rose to
go.

“Barclay and I’ll go with you a way,” said
Joe. “McRae doesn’t care, as long as we’re back
by eleven.”

They strolled through the brilliantly lighted
streets until they had reached Rad’s home and
then Joe and Jim Barclay started to return.

Finding that they were a little later than they
thought, they were making a short cut through a
side street, when their attention was drawn to a
man who emerged with unsteady steps from a saloon
on the corner. There was something familiar
about him, although they could not get
a clear view of his face.

Suddenly Joe gave vent to a startled ejaculation:

“Great Scott, Jim!” he exclaimed, “it’s Bugs
Hartley!”

“So it is,” replied Jim, looking more closely.
“And he’s pretty well loaded. What’ll McRae
say?”

“What he’ll say will be plenty,” returned Joe,
“and he won’t stop with talking. He’ll fire him
from the team. Look here, Jim, we’ve got to get
him into the hotel without Mac seeing him.”

[189]

“How are we going to do it?” asked Jim.

“I don’t know, but I’m going to try. Hello,
Hartley,” he called, coming up beside the man.

Hartley turned and looked at our hero sourly.

“Hello yourself,” he said with a lurch. “Whaz
mazher?”

“Nothing’s the matter,” replied Joe, “except
that you’d better come home with us right away.
It’s nearly eleven o’clock and it’s time we were in
bed. We don’t want McRae to make the rounds
and find our rooms empty. Come along.”

Hartley, with an intoxicated man’s stubbornness,
was inclined to argue the question, but Joe
and Jim ranged themselves alongside and half
urged, half dragged him along, until they drew
near the hotel.

“You stay here,” directed Joe, who had thought
out a way of smuggling his team-mate into the
hotel, “while I go on and fix things up.”

He slipped in and found the head porter to
whom he passed a bill, at the same time telling
him what he wanted. The porter suggested that
they go through the servant’s quarters in the rear
of the hotel and upstairs by a freight elevator that
he arranged to have in readiness. Joe went back
to where he had left the others, and by dint of
strenuous efforts he and Jim finally got Hartley
up to his room without detection. There they
surrendered him to the tender mercy of his room-mate,[190]
who helped him to get undressed and put
him to bed.

Joe and Jim adjourned to their own room.
They were flustered and distressed. They felt
bitterly indignant at Hartley who, by his recklessness,
was threatening to wreck the chances of
the team. Yet they felt that they could not have
acted differently from what they had.

“He’s a peach, isn’t he?” said Jim, indignantly.

“That’s what he is,” returned Joe. “And it’s
his regular turn to go in the box tomorrow. He’ll
be in fine condition to pitch. They’ll knock him
all over the lot.”

“Just when the team was moving along so
smoothly,” groaned Jim. “It’s like throwing a
monkey wrench into a ship’s engines. Before you
know it, the whole thing’s ready for the scrap
heap.”

“It’s too bad,” assented Joe. “But all we can
do is to hope that it won’t happen again. Perhaps
when he comes to his senses, he’ll realize
what a close call he’s had and cut out the liquor
for good.”

As Joe had predicted, the Cardinals made
merry with Hartley’s curves the next day and
won the game with ease. Joe put the second
game on the right side of the ledger, and Hughson
accounted for the third. Markwith had a
bad day, however, in the concluding game, and[191]
the team had to be satisfied with an even break,
where they had fondly hoped for three out of four
or possibly a clean sweep.

They were a trifle luckier in Chicago, where
they won two out of three, rain preventing the
last game. Cincinnati yielded three straight,
though the Queen Cityites took the fourth, and
in Pittsburgh, where they wound up their first
Western invasion, they broke even.

“Not so bad for a road trip, nine out of fifteen,”
said Larry Barrett, as he was talking it
over with Joe. “As a matter of fact it’s better
than we did at home. But the Giants always
have been a good road team. But now you’ve
had a chance to size up every team in the league.
You’ve seen their weak points and their strong
ones. Tell me straight, who do you think will
win the pennant?”

“The Giants,” replied Joe, without a second’s
hesitation.

“That listens good,” laughed Larry. “There’s
nothing like feeling sure of a thing. I only hope
you’re right.”

But a time was coming when Joe would have
given a great deal to be half as sure as he was that
afternoon.



[192]




CHAPTER XXIV
A CLOSE CALL


The Giants were hailed with acclamations by
the New York press and public on their return.
The sporting critics agreed that the team had
been “licked into shape” by their astute manager
in a surprisingly short time. One enthusiast even
went so far as to hail them as the coming champions,
a thing which vexed McRae, who knew
too much of the ups and downs of baseball to
want to claim a pennant before it was won.

He himself had more than one thing to worry
about. The team had “got by” so far through
the marvelous pitching of Hughson and Joe. Not
only had they won a large proportion of their
games, but they had relieved the other pitchers
when games were all but lost and pulled them out
of the fire. But where he had fondly counted on
four first string pitchers, he suddenly found himself
reduced to two who were really pitching “up
to form.”

Markwith had proved to be not nearly so good
as in the preceding year. He still possessed marvelous[193]
speed and his curves were breaking well,
but he lacked endurance. Part of this was due,
perhaps, to his winter on the vaudeville stage,
with its irregular hours and feverish atmosphere,
and part also to the wonderful record of nineteen
straight the season before. Perhaps the great
strain had sapped his stamina. Whatever the
cause, he could not be relied on for a full nine
inning game. For six innings, he would pitch with
all his old time skill and power. Then would
come a bad inning and&mdash;bang! to an accompaniment
of base hits, the game would go up in
smoke.

Hartley also seemed to be going to pieces. His
nerves were on edge. He was sullen, moody and
erratic. He had never been any too strong mentally,
and the life he lived had undermined his
physical strength. There were times when he
pitched a brilliant game and showed flashes of
his old ability, but these were steadily growing
fewer. McRae had by turns coaxed and threatened,
but he had almost reached the limit of his
patience, and Hartley’s stay with the Giants hung
by a thread that might snap at any moment.

A bright element in the outlook was the very
evident fact that Jim Barclay was a “comer.”
Twice McRae had ventured to put him in against
the weaker teams. In one case he had won, and
in the other held the enemy to a tie. But he was[194]
not yet ripe enough to take a regular turn in the
box. Joe helped him all he could, and Robson,
who tried him out each morning, was sure that in
time he would develop into a star.

Joe was jubilant at the success he had met with
so far. He felt stronger and better physically
than he had ever felt in his life. His arm was
giving him no trouble, despite the unusual demands
made upon it, and he never shirked or complained
if he was called out of his regular turn.
As Robson confided to McRae, they had found
a man at last who was a “glutton for work.”

But Joe had another object of devotion outside
of his attachment to his team, and shortly after
the return from the first Western trip he was
lifted into the seventh heaven of delight by the
receipt of a dainty letter in feminine handwriting
that told him Mabel was coming to New York.
She did not know how long she should stay, but
it would be for a week at least. Reggie was coming
with her. She was not sure at what hotel she
should stop, but if Joe would like to have her do
so, she would call him up by ’phone and tell him
where she was stopping.

If Joe would like!

His blood raced wildly a few days later when
he took up the telephone and heard Mabel’s voice.

“Is that you, Joe?” she asked. “This
is Mabel.”

[195]

“Don’t I know it?” he answered. “Tell me
quick where you are!”

“I’m at the Marlborough,” she answered,
“but&mdash;&mdash;”

“Yes, I know,” said Joe. “I’ll be there in
ten minutes.”

He raced to the street, hailed a taxi, and in
less than the promised ten minutes stood in the
presence of the one person on earth he most
wanted to see.

Joe had thought that it was impossible for her
to be prettier or sweeter than she had been in
Goldsboro, but now he knew that he had been
mistaken.

“How impetuous you are!” she pouted. “You
didn’t let me finish what I was saying on the
’phone.”

“I suppose a man dying of thirst is impetuous
when he catches sight of water,” answered Joe.
“I suppose&mdash;&mdash;”

But what Joe supposed was destined to remain
unspoken at that time, for just then Reggie, who
had been down at the hotel office, came into the
room. If he had only waited five minutes longer!
Perhaps even Mabel could have been reconciled
to her brother’s absence, if the blood that dyed
her cheeks was any indication.

“How are you, old chap?” cried Reggie, wholly
unaware that he was not wanted. “I’m no end[196]
glad to see you, don’t you know. So glad that
you looked us up. I hope you’ll find time to go
around with us a lot while we’re here.”

“I certainly will if you will let me,” declared
Joe, shaking hands with his friend. “Our team
is playing at home all this week, thank fortune.
I want you to be my guest at as many of the games
as you care to see, and in the evenings we can
take in some of the plays that are running in town,
or take trips down to the seashore. There’s no
better summer resort after all than little old
New York.”

“I agree with you there, old man,” answered
Reggie, “and we’ll be glad to put the matter to
the test. But tonight I want you to stay and take
dinner with us at the hotel.”

And as Mabel seconded the invitation, Joe did
not have to be urged very hard. As a matter of
fact, in his present mood it would have taken
something like a crane and derrick to remove him
from what had suddenly become the most interesting
place in New York.

They had a most enjoyable dinner and it was
only after he had returned to his hosts’ rooms
that Joe broached the subject of Talham Tabbs.

“Have you had any news of your securities?”
he asked, when he had Reggie for a moment
alone.

A frown came over his friend’s face.

[197]

“Not a blessed thing doing,” he declared. “I’ve
run down every clue that had the least promise
to it and I’m just as far away from getting them
back as I’ve been from the beginning. I guess
they’re past praying for.”

“Of course, you told Mabel as you promised?”
ventured Joe.

“Sure thing,” said Reggie. “I told her that
very night. The dear girl has helped and cheered
me up in every way possible. She’s pure gold.”

Joe assented to this with what might have
seemed almost unnecessary emphasis.

“Never give up the ship though, old man,” he
encouraged. “We’ll lay that fellow by the heels
yet. Soon or late we’ll nab him.”

“We’ll hope so,” said Reggie, with a faint
smile; and as Mabel came over just then to where
they were standing, the theme was changed.

They decided on several ways to pass the week
agreeably, and among other things it was settled
that they should visit the Bronx Zoo, of which
Mabel had often heard and which had just been
adding largely to its already wonderful collection.

The next day the Giants were to play the
Brooklyns, but when Joe looked out of the window,
he saw that the rain was falling steadily.

“No game today if this keeps up,” was his
mental comment.

[198]

It did keep up until afternoon, and the game
was called off. At two o’clock it cleared, and
Joe called up Mabel and suggested that they
should go to the Zoo that afternoon. Reggie was
engaged downtown, but Mabel complied gladly
with the suggestion.

They had passed two delightful hours wandering
about in the famous Park when, just as
they were nearing one of the animal houses, there
was a sudden commotion and the crowd scattered
in all directions. From within came the hoarse
shouts of keepers, and attendants came running
with ropes and pitchforks.

“Look out!” they shouted. “Run for your
lives! Get inside the other houses! The leopard
is loose!”

There was a wild panic, and the crowd rushed
frantically for shelter. The doorways were
blocked by a frantic, struggling mob. The screams
of women and frightened children blended with
the deeper shouts of the men, and the result was
pandemonium.

Joe saw that there was no chance of getting inside.
He seized Mabel by the arm and hurried
down one of the side paths, at the foot of which
was a small toolhouse whose door he saw was
open.

They had nearly reached it when Mabel gave
a stifled shriek.

[199]

“Look!” she cried, and pointed to a clump of
bushes at the side of the path and about twenty
feet away.

Joe looked, and for a moment his heart stood
still.

Crouching at the foot of the bushes with his
tail moving slowly to and fro, was a large leopard,
his yellow eyes glowing wickedly and every muscle
stiffened as he prepared for a spring.

Joe had never carried a weapon, and even if
he had had a revolver it is doubtful whether it
would have stopped that huge body if it had come
hurtling toward them. He looked wildly about
him after he had thrust Mabel behind a bench.

At his feet was a jagged piece of rock weighing
perhaps a pound. It was a forlorn chance but his
only one.

Like a flash, he stooped, grasped it firmly, and
hurled it with all his might at the leopard. The
distance was so short that he could not miss, and
the rock caught the brute in the neck just under
the ear. There was a scream of pain and rage,
the topaz glow faded from the eyes, and the
beast collapsed in a crumpled heap.

Joe did not wait an instant. He was not sure
whether the brute was killed or merely stunned.
He took Mabel by the arm and half carrying her
got her to one of the gates. He put her into a
taxi standing at the curb and they were whirled[200]
downtown to the Marlborough. She was white
and shaken at their narrow escape and Joe himself
was by no means calm. If anything had happened
to Mabel! He shuddered at the thought.

“Oh, Joe, you have saved my life!” she exclaimed,
when she could speak coherently. “That
horrible brute!” she shuddered.

Joe wanted to tell her why that life was so [see Tr. Notes]
precious to him and to urge that since he had
saved it, it fairly belonged to him. But this would
have been taking her at a disadvantage just then
and he contented himself with the warm pressure
of the little hand that rested in his and showed
no inclination to withdraw.



[201]




CHAPTER XXV
FIGHTING FOR THE LEAD


Joe chuckled to himself the next day, as he
read the highly-colored stories in the papers bearing
on the happening at the Park. The leopard
had escaped while it was being transferred from
one cage to another, and had afterward been
found dead with a broken neck in a side path of
the Park. There was a good deal of speculation
as to how it had been killed, but apart from the
fact that it had been due to a blow nothing was
positively known. It was confidently predicted,
however, that the whole truth would be uncovered
in a day or two.

“Not unless I talk in my sleep, it won’t,” decided
Joe.

He had no liking for notoriety, but it was chiefly
on Mabel’s account that he kept silent. He knew
how deeply she would dread having her name
appear in print. She was one of those who believed
that a woman’s name should appear in the
papers only three times&mdash;when she was born,
when she married and when she died. And Joe[202]
agreed with her. It was astonishing how he was
growing to agree with her on everything.

The week of Mabel’s stay passed all too quickly.
Joe grudged every hour of it. They went
about everywhere when his duties permitted, and
he had the satisfaction of winning a game under
her approving eyes. When at last he saw her on
the train for Goldsboro, she had promised to
come to New York to see the wind-up of the season
at the Polo Grounds.

“I’m looking for you to win the pennant and
get into the World’s Series,” she said at parting.
“You won’t disappoint me, will you?”

“We’ve simply got to win it,” he replied. “I
need that World’s Series money badly. Why if I
had that I could&mdash;&mdash;”

But Reggie blundered along just then, and Joe
could not tell what he wanted to do with the
money. But perhaps Mabel guessed.

The baseball campaign was waxing hotter and
hotter. The teams were so close together that,
as they say of racing horses, “one blanket would
have covered them.” So far, it was anybody’s
race. In the East, Brooklyn was making a great
spurt and had drawn up close to the front. Chicago
was showing the way to the Western teams,
but St. Louis was crowding close at her heels.
It was a ding-dong, slam-bang race, with first one
and then the other showing in front, and the[203]
whole baseball public was in a state of feverish
excitement. Great crowds gathered around the
bulletin boards in every large city. All agreed
that it was the most even race in years. Huge
throngs filled the playing grounds and the game
was on the topmost wave of prosperity.

When the Western teams finished their first
visit East, the Chicagos were leading the league
by three full games. Brooklyn was second, and
St. Louis was tied with the Giants for third.

That they were not leading at this stage in the
season did not greatly worry McRae. He knew
what a fearful strain was on the team that went
out in front and he was content to let it make the
pace, as long as he could trail along within easy
striking distance.

Joe, however, was not so philosophical. He
had the instinct of the thoroughbred, and hated
to see anyone bowling along in front of him.

“I hate to take anyone’s dust,” he said one day
to Jim. “It makes me wild to have Chicago showing
us the way.”

“They’ll come back to us all right,” said Jim,
confidently. “The last few games they’ve just
won out and that’s all. They’ve fallen down badly
of late in their batting.”

And Jim was right, for, two weeks later, Chicago
had resigned the lead to Brooklyn and had
fallen to the foot of the first division.

[204]

The see-saw persisted until the latter part of
August. By that time “class” had begun to tell.
Three teams had drawn away from all the others,
and it was clear that, barring accidents, the flag
would fly in one of three cities, Boston, Chicago
or New York.

The Giants on their last trip West had made
a runaway campaign of it. They had simply
cleaned up everything. They led the league in
batting and were third in fielding. But what
counted most was that they were out in front ten
straight games ahead of the nearest contender.
The New York papers were already beginning to
speculate what pitchers McRae would pin his
faith to in the World’s Series.

“It’s our pitching staff that has carried us
through so far,” exulted McRae in one of his talks
with Robson. “That is,” he corrected, “it’s the
great work of Hughson and Matson. That young
Barclay, too, has rounded to in fine shape. If
only Markwith had kept up his great work this
season, we’d be so far ahead that they couldn’t
see us with a telescope.”

“It is too bad the way he’s fallen down,” mused
Robson, “and Hartley too has been a big disappointment.
I tell you, Mac, you never did a better
stroke of work in your life than when you got
Matson from St. Louis. That fellow is the biggest
sensation of the year. You notice that when[205]
he’s announced to pitch the crowds are almost as
big as those who come out to see Hughson. I’ll
bet,” he chuckled, “that you’re going to lose that
thousand dollar bonus before the season is over.
He’s already won fifteen games, and the way he
is going it’s a dead cinch that he’ll get the other
five.”

“I’ll be only too glad to lose it,” grinned McRae.
“He’s already brought it in at the box
office ten times over. You’re right when you say
he’s been a mighty good investment. If we fly
the flag in New York, he’ll be responsible for it.”

“It’s lucky you signed him for a three-years’
contract,” went on Robson. “If you hadn’t, every
club in the league would have been offering him
big money at the end of the season.”

“He won’t lose anything by it,” declared McRae,
decidedly. “If he keeps up the way he has
begun, I won’t hold him to the figures of his contract.
He’ll get a big slice of World’s Series
money, and I’ll start him off next season at figures
that will make his hair curl.”

“Knock wood, Mac,” counseled Robson, nervously.
“I don’t like to hear you talking yet of
the World’s Series as though it were a certainty.
You’re never in more danger than when you feel
surest. We’re not yet out of the woods, and you
know as well as I that baseball is the most uncertain
game in the world.”

[206]

“You’re right, Robbie, old boy,” assented his
friend. “I know that there’s always a chance of
falling down. I wouldn’t talk this way with anyone
but you. But on the dead level, I can’t for
the life of me see how we’re going to lose unless
our pitching staff goes to pieces.”

Two days later the pitching staff went to pieces.



[207]




CHAPTER XXVI
THE SLUMP


The trouble began with Hartley.

On the last Western trip he seemed to lose
what little shred of self-control he had left, and
began to drink heavily.

His comrades tried to shield him, as Joe and
Jim had done on an earlier occasion, but all to
no purpose. In his sober moods he was penitent
and promised solemnly never to offend again. But
his moral fibre had been weakened by self-indulgence,
and with every debauch he became the less
able to resist temptation.

McRae had pleaded with him and threatened
him. He had fully resolved to release him when
the season was over, but he hoped to keep him
going fairly well till the end of the present year.
When Hartley was “good,” he was almost unhittable,
and in a close finish he might come in
handy.

But of late he had been losing almost every
game that he pitched. Twice in one week Joe
had gone in when Hartley had been batted from[208]
the mound and by superhuman exertions had just
nosed out a victory.

Hartley resented this bitterly. He seemed
to think that Joe was trying to “show him up.”
He glared at our hero whenever they came near
each other, growled at him in the clubhouse after
the game, and on two occasions of late had tried
to trip him.

Joe attributed this to his mental state, and
where he would have resented, with his fists if
need be, such conduct on the part of another, he
passed it over pityingly in the case of Hartley.

“Bugs seems to have it in for me,” he remarked
to Jim one day, when they were dressing after
the game. “You’d think that after I’d tried to
shield him as I did in St. Louis, he’d be grateful,
instead of trying to harm me in any way he
could.”

“It’s just an illustration of the old motto: ‘Do
a man a favor and he’ll never forgive you,’” returned
Jim. “The trouble with Bugs is that he
isn’t right in the upper story. His nickname fits
him right enough.”

Finally, McRae, wrought to exasperation by
the loss of a game that ought to have been won
easily, gave Hartley his ten days’ notice of release.
And this time, although Hartley begged hard
for another chance, the manager was adamant.

“It’s no use, Hartley,” he declared. “You’ve[209]
told me the same thing fifty times and you’ve
fallen down every time. Here’s where you and
I part company.”

Hartley saw that this time McRae was really
through with him. He began at once to pull
wires to land a berth in some other club. But in
the meantime, his unreasonable hate of Joe developed
until he could think of little else.

Joe himself, although he had every reason to
be glad at Hartley’s departure from the club,
was sincerely sorry for the plight in which the
latter found himself, and took early occasion to
tell him so.

“I hope you’ll land something else right away,
Hartley,” he said, heartily. “There ought to be
some years of big league pitching in you yet, and
some of the other clubs will soon be after you,
when they know they can get you.”

“You shut up!” snarled Hartley. “I’m not asking
any sympathy from you or anybody else. I
was pitching in the big league when you were a
busher and I’ll be pitching in it yet when you’re
fired back to the minors. You’ve been trying to
do me ever since you’ve been on the club. You’ve
put on extra steam whenever you’ve followed me
in a game, just to show that you could win where
I was losing. I’ve been on to you, all right.”

“If you were any one else, I’d ram those words
down your throat!” exclaimed Joe, angered at[210]
finding his friendly advances met in such fashion.
“But you have troubles enough just now without
my adding to them. You’re your own worst
enemy, Hartley, and it’s time you got wise to it.”

He turned on his heel and left him and did not
see the man until noon the next day. Then Hartley
approached him as he sat at the hotel table.
Joe was slated to pitch that day, and as he did
not like to eat a heavy meal immediately before
the game, he had come down for a light lunch
earlier than the rest of the team.

Hartley came up to him with a pleasant smile.

“I’m sorry I spoke to you the way I did yesterday,
Matson,” he said. “But I was feeling
sore and wanted to take it out on somebody. I
hope there’s no hard feelings.”

“Not in the least,” said Joe, whose nature was
too large to cherish a grudge. “Any man is liable
to say what he doesn’t mean when things
aren’t going just right. Just forget all about it.”

He pointed to a chair opposite.

“Sit down and have a cup of coffee with me,”
he invited. “I was just going to order one for
myself to finish up with.”

Hartley accepted the invitation and Joe signaled
the waiter and gave the order. They chatted
on various topics until the coffee was placed before
them. Hartley motioned the waiter to put
the cups down near him.

[211]

“I’ve got the sugar and cream right here,” he
said, lightly. “How many lumps of sugar, Matson?”

“Two will do,” answered Joe, “and just a drop
of cream.”

Hartley dropped two cubes in Joe’s cup and at
the same time slipped in a tiny white tablet that
he had extracted from his vest pocket.

“There you are,” he said, as he passed the
cup over.

He swallowed the contents of his own cup with
a gulp.

“Well, I’ll have to be going,” he remarked
after a moment. “I understand you’re going to
pitch against the Phillies this afternoon. Hope
you trim them, all right.”

“Thanks,” responded Joe. “I’ll do my best,
but they have a big batting streak on just now and
all pitchers look alike to them. But if our boys
back me up with the stick, I’ll try to hold them
down.”

After Hartley had gone, Joe glanced at his
watch. He saw that it was later than he thought
and swallowed his coffee hastily. He noticed
that it had rather a bitter taste, but the matter
passed from his mind the next moment.



[212]




CHAPTER XXVII
FROM BAD TO WORSE


Whatever the drug that Hartley had used, it
was of such a nature that it did not take effect at
once. Joe felt in his usual good shape for some
time after he got into his baseball togs. It is
true that the ball seemed to feel a little heavier
than usual when he was warming up, but he suspected
nothing when the time came for him to go
into the box.

The first thing that he noticed was that he did
not have his usual control. His curves would not
break at the right place, and he could not seem
to get them over the plate. Then too, his speed
was missing. He called on all his resources, but
the ball sailed up to the plate as “big as a balloon.”

The Phillies were quick to notice that something
was wrong with that “wing” of Matson’s, which
in previous games they had learned to respect.
Before the first inning was over, they had lined
out two slashing hits which, with three bases on
balls, netted them three runs to start with.

[213]

“What’s the matter, Matson?” asked McRae,
as the Giants came in to bat.

“Oh, I’m all right, I guess,” answered Joe.
“I’ll steady down in the next inning. I guess I
didn’t warm up enough.”

The Giants were quickly disposed of for a goose
egg and Joe again took his place on the mound.
He walked out to it a little unsteadily, a fact that
McRae’s keen eyes were quick to notice.

“If that were anybody else than Matson, I’d
say he’d been drinking,” he remarked to Robson.

“Nothing like that,” replied Robson. “We’ll
see how he makes out this time.”

But the very first ball he sent over, Cravath,
the chief slugger of the Phillies, knocked clear
over the right field fence for a home run.

A fusillade of hits followed until the bases were
full.

“Look here, Matson,” said McRae, sharply,
walking over to him. “What’s the matter with
you? They’ve put the game on ice already. Take
a brace, man.”

Shouts of derision came from the Phillies’
bench.

“He hasn’t anything on the ball but his glove!”
one of them jeered.

“It’s a shame to take the money!” yelled another.

“All aboard for the airship!” cried a third.

[214]

A flush of humiliation passed over Joe’s face.

He could see that Robson was hurrying a couple
of the second string pitchers out into a corner of
the field to warm up. It was a new experience for
him and a bitter one.

“I’ll get them yet,” he said to McRae, and the
latter noticed that his voice was thick. “Let me
play the inning out.”

“Play ball!” called the umpire, and McRae
walked back to the coaching line. Joe made a
mighty effort, but the first ball he pitched was sent
into left on a line, and the three men on bases
scampered home.

“That’s enough,” cried McRae sharply, while
the rejoicing Phillies held a jubilee at their bench.
“Take off your glove and go to the clubhouse.”

Joe took off his glove and with his face scarlet
walked unsteadily off the field. He had been
batted out of the box in one of the crucial games
of the season. What would his folks say when
they read of it? What would Mabel say?

By this time his head was throbbing, and every
bone had its own particular ache. The shower
brightened him up a little, but in a few minutes
he was worse than ever, and it was all he could
do to get to his hotel. There he stumbled and
would have fallen if it had not been for one of
the attendants. He took him to his room, where
he lay down upon the bed and fell into a stupor.[215]
There Jim found him when he returned and immediately
called a physician. Together they
worked over him until after a couple of hours the
effects of the drug had been counteracted to a large
extent, and although weak and white he began
to feel more like his natural self.

“What on earth could have been the matter,
Joe?” asked Jim. “Could it have been a case of
ptomaine poisoning? All the doctor was sure of
was that it was a drug or poison of some kind.
What have you been eating?”

“Nothing out of the ordinary,” answered Joe.
“In fact I just had a couple of sandwiches and an
omelet for lunch. And coffee,” he added, and
then as a sudden thought struck him he sat up
straight in bed.

“I had some coffee with Bugs Hartley,” he
added, slowly. “And it was Bugs that put the
cream and sugar in both cups.”

They looked at each other for a full minute
without speaking.

“I see a great light,” said Jim at last. “The
first thing I shall do is to hunt up Hartley and
thrash him within an inch of his life.”

“No, don’t do that,” said Joe, earnestly. “We
haven’t positive proof, and it’ll only bring scandal
on the game. I’ll be as well as ever in a day or
two. The worst of it is that I’m afraid McRae
thought I had been drinking.”

[216]

“He must know better than that,” replied Jim,
indignantly. “But just to make sure I’ll give him
a quiet tip as to the real state of things.”

“I certainly felt sore to be batted out of the
box,” said Joe, his thoughts reverting to
the game. “What was the score, anyway?”

Jim hesitated a second.

“Fifteen to three,” he got out at last. Joe’s
face lengthened.

“That was a massacre sure enough,” he
groaned. “The biggest score any team has rolled
up against us this season. Who went in after I
was taken out?”

“Markwith,” answered Jim. “But he couldn’t
do a thing with them. They simply slammed him
to all corners of the lot. But by that time the
game was gone anyway, and McRae just let him
stay in and take his medicine.”

“And how did the Chicagos make out today?”
asked Joe.

“They trimmed the Pittsburghs, four to three,”
replied Jim. “Those fellows seem to have taken
a new lease of life. A little while ago we were
ten games ahead of them. Now they’re only six
games behind and coming fast.”

“Their pitchers are working well too,” commented
Joe. “You notice that they’re holding
down their opponents to mighty small scores and
they’re handing out quite a few shut-outs. We’ve[217]
got our work cut out for us if we want to beat
those birds.”

“And we’ll have to do it in a hurry, too,” said
Jim. “The season’s pretty near an end. It’s a
case of now or never.”



[218]




CHAPTER XXVIII
LOCKING HORNS


The Giants were “slipping.”

There was no blinking the fact. The New
York public admitted it with dismay. The newspapers
of all the other league cities proclaimed it
with delight.

Not slipping fast, but slipping surely.

Not that they were quitting. They were game
to the core. Everybody was working desperately
to hold on to the slender lead that they had fought
for so gallantly in the early part of the season.
McRae and Robson, crafty old foxes that they
were, worked day and night to bolster up the weak
places. They changed the batting order. They
used their pinch hitters. They put the team
through morning practice. They perfected the
“inside stuff.” They worked every trick known
to the game.

But still the Giants kept slipping. The batting
was far below the usual standard. The men
“fought” the ball instead of fielding it cleanly.
The pitching staff was too limited. Hughson and[219]
Joe were pitching magnificent ball, but they were
the only first-string pitchers that could be absolutely
relied on. Some of the second string men,
notably Jim, were doing well, but now that every
game was so important, McRae did not dare to
put them in. The strain was apt to be too much
for any but the veterans.

There were times when the Giants seemed to
throw off the baleful paralysis that was holding
them and play in something of their old brilliant
form. But too many defeats were mixed in with
victories, and all the time those scrappy Chicagos,
seldom losing, kept closing up the gap, until when
the last week of the season arrived they were
right on the Giants’ heels.

By the mere chance of the schedule, the Chicagos
were to wind up the season with the New
Yorks on the Polo Grounds. Four games were to
be played. Before the series commenced, the
Giants were just one game in the lead. If the
Chicagos could take three games out of the four,
they would win the championship.

The Giants had the advantage of playing on
their own grounds and in the presence of the home
crowds. That was an advantage not to be despised.
Moreover, they only had to win two out
of the four, while the Chicagos were required to
win three.

But, on the other hand, the men from the[220]
Windy City were on the aggressive, while the
Giants were on the defensive. And the Chicagos
had been climbing while the New Yorks had
been slipping. These facts had a significance all
their own, and despite the apparent odds in favor
of the home team, opinion was about evenly divided
as to who would bear off the victory.

McRae figured on pitching Hughson in the first
game of the series. The veteran had always had
the “Indian sign” on the Chicagos, and the chances
were that he would win his game. If he did, the
Giants would only have to take one out of the remaining
three. Joe and Markwith would try for
the second and third. If by an evil fate they lost
both, McRae could again call on Hughson for the
fourth and deciding game.

On the night before the first game, McRae
dropped into the uptown hotel where the Chicagos
were quartered, to have a word of friendly greeting
with Brennan, the manager of the Windy City
warriors.

While they were bitter enemies on the ball field,
each fighting like a wildcat for every shred of advantage,
they were the best of friends when once
they had discarded their uniforms and gotten into
their street clothes. In this they were not unlike
the lawyers who berate each other bitterly while
the case is on, and after the court has adjourned
go to lunch together arm in arm.

[221]

Brennan saw his opponent enter, and, rising
from the group of reporters who were trying to
get from him his views on the series, came forward
to greet him with extended hand, a broad
grin on his features.

“How are you, John?” he queried. “Have you
come in to ask me to let you off easy tomorrow?”

“Not a bit of it, Roger,” laughed McRae as he
shook hands. “I simply heard that there were a
lot of dead ones in town and I wanted to know
what cemetery you’d prefer to be buried in. I’ll
make it Woodlawn or Greenwood or any place
you say. Or if you like, I’ll ship your remains
back to Chicago.”

“You always were a good bluffer, John,” retorted
Roger. “But I can see that you’re just
whistling to keep your courage up. When we go
back to Chicago it won’t be in boxes, but in Pullmans;
and we’re going to take the pennant along
with us.”

“Where do you get that stuff?” rejoined McRae.
“I’ll set the squirrels after you if you don’t
stop your foolishness. I’m only wondering
whether I’ll take four straight or let you have just
one of the series as a sort of booby prize.”

They chaffed each other good-naturedly for a
while, to the great delight of the reporters and
hotel guests, who had gathered in a dense crowd
about them.

[222]

“You’ve got only a one-man team, John,” Brennan
wound up. “Hughson’s carried the team
along for years. If it hadn’t been for him you
wouldn’t have won a pennant in the last ten years.”

“How about Matson?” parried McRae. “Do
you remember the last game he twirled against
you in Chicago?”

Brennan winced and the crowd laughed at the
memory of that game, which had been a Waterloo
for the men of the Windy City.

“He caught us off our stride that day,” he admitted,
“and we’re aching to get at him. We’re
all tuned up to knock him out of the box.”

A little more banter, and McRae rose to go.

“Sorry to have to leave you,” he remarked, “but
I have an appointment to see a man about setting
up a new pennant pole at the Polo Grounds.”

“I’m ahead of you there, John,” laughed Brennan.
“I ordered mine before I left Chicago.”

“You’ll be sending a wire in a day or two to
countermand the order,” the Giant leader prophesied.
“By the way, Roger,” he went on, dropping
his scoffing tone, “if you want to use the grounds
for morning practice, I’ll fix it up so that you can
divide the time with my boys.”

“That’s very white of you, John,” replied Brennan
warmly, “and I appreciate it. But I guess I’ll
stick to the regular rule and let you have it all to
yourself. Thanks, though, just the same.”

[223]

They shook hands and parted with the mutual
respect of hard fighters and gallant sportsmen.

The city was wild with excitement and it was
a foregone conclusion that the four games would
draw bigger crowds than had ever before been
packed into the Polo Grounds.

Mabel, true to her promise, had come to the
city, accompanied by Reggie, and Joe had secured
seats for them in a box so located that they could
follow every move of the game. It is needless to
say that every spare minute that he could take
from his work was spent in the vicinity of the
Marlborough Hotel, at which the visitors were
again staying.

“You simply must win, Joe,” Mabel declared.
“You surely wouldn’t have the heart to lose after
I’ve come all the way from Goldsboro.”

“I haven’t any heart to lose anyway,” replied
Joe. “I lost that long ago.”

“I see Hughson is going to pitch the first
game,” said Mabel, hastily changing the subject
to a safer ground. “Do you think he will win?”

“Sure I do,” replied Joe, enthusiastically.
“He’s the greatest pitcher that ever threw a
ball.”

“They say there’s a good deal of professional
jealousy among artists,” laughed Mabel, “but you
don’t seem to be troubled that way.”

“Not a particle where Hughson is concerned,”[224]
affirmed Joe, stoutly. “He’s one of the best
friends I have on the team and I root for him
for all I’m worth every time he goes into the
box.”

“You’ll pitch the second game, I suppose,” she
went on.

“I think that’s the program just at present, but
you never can tell. Something might come up
that would make McRae change his mind five minutes
before the game begins.”

“I’ll have an advantage over the other pitchers.
They’ll only have one glove while I’ll have
two.”

Mabel opened her eyes and was about to ask
an explanation, but as Joe tapped his pocket, she
remembered the glove that she had given him at
Goldsboro and blushed in confusion.

She was never lovelier than when she blushed,
and there is no knowing what would have happened
right then and there, if Reggie had not
come on the scene. Joe liked Reggie, but there
were times when he certainly was a nuisance.

“Well, Joe, how are you feeling?” asked Reggie
amiably, as they shook hands. “Not suffering
from palpitation of the heart or anything like that,
I suppose?”

To tell the truth, Joe’s heart was palpitating
very strongly just at that moment. But it was
not the thought of the big games that caused it.[225]
Perhaps Mabel could have guessed the reason
more accurately than Reggie.

“I never felt better,” Joe replied.

“Going to put it all over the Chicagos, I hope,”
continued Reggie.

“That’s what we’re figuring on,” answered Joe.
“But those fellows are going great guns just now
and it will be a man’s job to beat them. By the
way,” he added, changing the subject, “have you
found any trace of Tabbs?”

“Not a thing,” replied Reggie gloomily. “I
guess I’ll have to charge that ten thousand up to
experience. It’s coming near time to report to my
father and I’d rather be shot than do it.”

The first game justified the choice of McRae.
Hughson was never in better form. He simply
toyed with the opposing batsmen. His famous
fadeaway was working to perfection. Twice he
mowed down the side in one-two-three order.
His control was absolute and not an enemy
reached his base on balls. Three times there were
men on the bags, once through an error and
twice as the result of hits, but Hughson tightened
up and they never got farther than second. It
was a superb exhibition of twirling, and amid the
frantic applause of the vast crowd the game
ended with the score:

New Yorks 5, Chicagos 0.

First blood for the Giants!



[226]




CHAPTER XXIX
AN UNEXPECTED MEETING


There was great hilarity in the Giants’ camp
that night, and this feeling was shared by the
entire city. Now the Chicagos would have to
take all the remaining games to win, and with
Joe and Hughson pitching two of them, this
seemed altogether unlikely.

Joe was on his way to the grounds the next
morning to get a little preliminary practice. He
just wanted to “toss up a few” to make sure that
his arm was in perfect working order for the
game that afternoon. He wanted to settle the
thing then and there, so that the long strain would
be over and the two remaining games would be
simply for the sake of finishing out the schedule.

He had plenty of time, and for the sake of the
walk he left the elevated train two stations this
side of the Polo Grounds and walked north
through Eighth Avenue. There were many vacant
lots in this locality, and there were not very
many people on the avenue at that hour.

He glanced carelessly at a man who passed[227]
him with his hat drawn down over his face. It
struck him that there was something about the
fellow that was vaguely familiar. Where had
he seen that lean, sharp-featured face?

Suddenly it came to him and he turned about
like a flash.

The man was Talham Tabbs!

By this time the crazy man was nearly a block
away, and he too was looking back as though the
recognition had been mutual.

Joe did not hesitate for an instant. Fate had
thrown this chance in his way and he might never
have another. He started to run and then checked
himself for fear of alarming his quarry and subsided
into a swift walk.

But the cunning of the insane man had seen
Joe’s first movement and interpreted it correctly.
He turned into a vacant lot and broke into a
run.

Joe hesitated no longer at following his example;
and the next moment a lively chase was
on.

By the time Joe turned into the lot, Tabbs was
three hundred feet ahead and running hard. But
he was no match for a young man who was in
the pink of condition and who was able to circle
the bases in fifteen seconds flat. In less than a
minute Joe was close on his heels. Tabbs turned
and twisted desperately and just as Joe reached[228]
out his hand to grasp him, he dodged under his
arms and doubled on his tracks. Joe swung
around as though on a pivot, and in another moment
his hand was on the collar of the panting
man. He dug his knuckles into Tabbs’ neck and
the latter ceased to struggle.

For a moment neither spoke, each trying to regain
his breath. Then, to Joe’s astonishment,
Tabbs grinned affably and twiddled his fingers
as he had done previously in the Riverside jail.

“Hello, brother,” greeted Tabbs. “That was
a good game of tag, wasn’t it? I guess I’m it.”

There was such an utter absence of malice or
resentment, that Joe, who had been bracing himself
for a struggle, was taken aback, and his
heart smote him a little as he saw Tabbs’ friendly
signal. But he was quick to follow his lead.

“I guess you are,” he laughed. “It’s just the
morning for a little run. You’re certainly a
dandy sprinter.”

A look of gratified vanity came over Tabbs.

“Let’s try it again,” he suggested. “I’ll chase
you this time and I’ll bet you can’t get away from
me.”

“That’s a good idea,” agreed Joe, “but first I
want to rest a little. It isn’t every one who can
keep it up like you, you know. Suppose we go
down to your rooms and have a little talk about
lodge matters first. Where are you living?”

[229]

“Up here in Amsterdam Avenue,” replied
Tabbs, promptly. “Come right along.”

They walked out to the avenue, Joe cudgeling
his brains as to what the next step should be. As
they reached the corner, he saw one of the policemen
who had been assigned to duty at the Polo
Grounds. He was in citizen’s clothes and bowed
cordially to Joe.

“Excuse me just a moment, while I speak to
this friend of mine,” said Joe to his companion.

“Certainly,” said Tabbs, politely.

Joe led Reardon, the policeman, aside.

“Reardon,” he said, hurriedly, and in a low
voice, “this man is crazy. I want you to keep out
of sight but follow us. When you see us go into
a house, call up the Marlborough and tell a Mr.
Varley there to come up right away. Then stand
guard at the door until I turn this man over to
you to be sent back to the asylum he escaped
from.”

“All right,” said Reardon, who had been
too long on the force to be surprised at anything.

A few minutes’ walk brought Joe and Tabbs
to a comfortable old-fashioned boarding house.

“Here we are,” the crazy man said, and led
the way to a large room on the second floor. Joe
noted in a corner a large valise with Tabbs’
initials on it.

They sat down and chatted about various[230]
things, and except for an occasional foolish remark
that had no bearing on the subject, Joe
would not have known that he was talking to a
lunatic. Tabbs had evidently been a man of keen
intelligence and wide observation. Joe kept leading
him on, trying desperately to kill time till
Reggie should arrive.

“If you’re rested enough now, we’ll go out and
finish that game of tag,” Tabbs had just remarked,
when a taxi whirled up to the door. Joe
flung open the door of the room and Reggie came
flying up the stairs and dashed in, followed by
Reardon, who carefully closed the door and put
his broad shoulders against it.

Tabbs looked in surprise at this sudden invasion
of his rooms. Then he recognized Reggie
and smiled genially.

“How do you do, Mr. Varley?” he said.

“Where are my securities?” demanded Reggie,
breathless with excitement.

“Your securities?” repeated Tabbs. “Let me
see. Perhaps I have them over here.”

He walked over to the valise, unlocked it, took
out a package and looked it over.

“These must be the ones,” he continued.
“They’ve been in my way for some time and I’ve
thought more than once of throwing them away.
I was trying to remember how I got hold of
them.”

[231]

With trembling fingers Reggie thumbed the papers.
Then he gave an exclamation of delight.

“Every one of them here!” he cried. “Joe, I
can never thank you enough for getting them back
for me.”

“Well, now,” said Tabbs, blandly, “let’s go
and have that game of tag.”

“I’m afraid we’ll have to let that go just now,”
said Joe, rising to go. “But this friend of mine
will take my place,” pointing to Reardon.

Tabbs assented cheerfully and waved a gay
farewell to Joe and Reggie, as they went downstairs
to the taxi, leaving him in Reardon’s custody.

“Poor old fellow!” sighed Joe, as he looked
for the last time on the wreck of what had been
a splendid man.

Reggie was eager to share his rejoicing with
Mabel and Joe would have gone with him if he
could. But so much time had been consumed that
the young pitcher had no more than time to get a
light lunch and hurry off to the Polo Grounds.

But when he reached the clubhouse, distressing
news awaited him. A disaster had come upon
the New York camp.

The great Hughson had had his arm twisted
in an auto accident and was out of the game for
the series!

Joe was knocked off his balance by the news.[232]
He realized at once the far reaching consequences
of the calamity. He knew the panic it would
create in the New York camp and the renewal of
heart and hope that would come to the enemy now
that their most dreaded foe was out of the running.

McRae was stamping about the clubhouse like a
crazy man. Robson sat moodily in one corner, his
arms folded on his breast. The players, in various
conditions of undress, were white and shaken
at the report that had just come over the telephone
from Hughson’s house.

It was not advisable to approach McRae in his
present frantic condition and Joe made his way
over to Robson.

“How did it happen?” he asked. “And how
bad is it?”

“So bad that it may knock us out of winning the
pennant,” groaned Robson. “I don’t know anything
about how it happened. Mrs. Hughson, who
called us up, was so excited that she couldn’t tell
us very clearly. Mac has sent for a taxi, and as
soon as it comes we’re going up to Hughson’s
house.”

At that moment word was brought that the
taxicab was waiting, and McRae and Robson hurried
toward the door.

McRae caught sight of Joe standing near.

“You come along with us,” he ordered. “Even[233]
if Hughson’s arm is hurt, his tongue and brain are
probably all right, and he may be able to give you
some fresh pointers on those Chicago sluggers
after facing them yesterday.”

Joe was only too willing, and they bundled in.
The driver, under the promise of a generous tip,
made fast time on his way to Hughson’s house.

They found the great pitcher reclining on a
lounge with his arm in bandages and his face
drawn with pain. He greeted them with a smile
that was evidently an effort.

“Come up to look at the wreck?” he inquired,
as they crowded anxiously around him. “Well,
I’m worth a dozen dead men yet, even if this arm
of mine is on the blink.”

“In the name of hard luck,” moaned McRae,
“how did it all happen?”

“Got caught between two trolley cars,” replied
Hughson. “I was in a taxi on Eighth Avenue on
my way to the grounds and the driver tried to
cross the tracks. Thought he could just slip by
between cars coming in opposite directions, but
missed his guess. I might just as well have been
killed as not, but all hands did their best, and I got
off with a wrenched back and a strained arm.”

“You’re sure there’s nothing broken?” inquired
Joe anxiously.

“Dead sure,” was the reply. “The doctor’s just
got through fixing me up, and he says that there[234]
are no bones or ligaments broken. But I’ll be on
the shelf for two or three weeks.”

“Two or three weeks!” groaned McRae. “And
this series will be over in two or three days!”

“It’s tough luck,” said Hughson bitterly. “I’d
have given my share of the World’s Series money
not to have had this thing happen.”

“Just when we had those fellows on the run,
too,” remarked Robson gloomily. “That beating
you gave them yesterday took a good deal of vim
out of them and we’d probably have cleaned ’em
up today. But when they hear of this they’ll be
like wild men and there’ll be no holding them.”

“I’ll trust Matson to tame them,” was Hughson’s
comforting remark. “He’s as good a man
at this moment as I ever dared to be.”

“Nobody’s as good as you are, Hughson,” was
Joe’s answer to this generous praise. “But you
can do an awful lot for me just now in giving me
pointers on what to feed those fellows,” he added.

“And you’ll have to hurry,” broke in McRae,
looking at his watch. “We haven’t much more
than time now to get back to the grounds.”

For five minutes there was an animated discussion,
and then, with a cordial goodby to Hughson,
the three entered the waiting taxicab and were
whirled back to the Polo Grounds.



[235]




CHAPTER XXX
A GLORIOUS SUCCESS


Consternation sat on every face. The easy
confidence of the night before was gone. A thunderbolt
had come out of the blue. The chief
prop had been knocked from under them. The
easy way in which Hughson had tamed the men
from the wild and woolly West had made it seem
a dead certainty that he would win if he should
be called on to repeat.

There was hot scurrying to and fro among the
leaders. McRae and Robson, with drawn faces,
were deep in discussion as to the best thing to
be done. The program would have to be radically
changed.

McRae came hurrying over to Joe when the
latter entered the clubhouse.

“I was going to pitch you today,” he declared,
“but I’ve changed my mind. I’ll have to save
my ace to take the last trick, if necessary. I’m
going to keep you for the final. Markwith goes
in today and I’ll take a chance on Barclay tomorrow.
That spitter of his may fool them.”

[236]

But neither Markwith nor Barclay fulfilled the
hope of their manager. The Chicagos, who were
like wild men, now that they seemed to have another
chance with the dreaded Hughson out of
the way, batted like fiends, and the two games
went to their credit by scores of seven to two and
six to four. Jim had held them to a tie up to the
eleventh inning, but then he faltered and they
batted in the winning runs.

Now the score was even. The result of the
last game would decide the championship and tell
whether the flag would fly in the East or the
West.

It was up to Joe. Upon his shoulders rested
the fortunes of his team. Would he be equal
to the task? That question was being asked in
every city between the Atlantic and the Pacific.
Reputation, the pennant, the chance to get into
the World’s Series&mdash;all of these depended upon
the skill and strength of that right arm of his.

The enormous crowd that packed the stands
gave him a tremendous greeting when he came on
the field and began to warm up. But in all that
sea of human faces, the only one that Joe looked
for was in an upper box where a handkerchief
waved at him. And in the pocket of his baseball
shirt a tiny glove lay close to his heart.

“How did he warm up, Robbie?” asked McRae
anxiously, as the bell rang for the game to begin[237]
and Robson came back to where he was sitting on
the players’ bench.

“All to the good,” declared Robson. “The ball
came into my mitt almost hard enough to knock
me down. They won’t be able to see them.”

For a moment, as Joe took up his position, he
had a touch of stage fright. His head whirled
and everything seemed to swim before his eyes.
Then his vision cleared, his heart ceased its thumping,
and his nerves became like steel.

“Zimmie,” the big third baseman of the Chicagos,
who led off in the batting order, swaggered
up to the plate, swinging three bats. He threw
away two of them and gripped the remaining one
tightly and glared at Joe.

“Trot them out, kid,” he called, “and I’ll murder
them. You’re only a false alarm, anyway.”

Joe shot the first one over for a beautiful strike
and the crowd yelled in delight.

“That’s the way, old man!” sang out Larry
from second. “They can’t touch you.”

The second was a ball and the next a foul.
Then a high, fast one with a hop to it, eluded Zimmie’s
bat and sent him back to the bench looking
sheepish.

The next one up hit a slow one to short that
got to first in plenty of time, and the third man
closed the inning with a two-balls-three-strikes record.

[238]

A tempest of cheers compelled Joe to remove
his cap as he came in to the bench.

“You’re going like a runaway horse, Matson,”
said McRae. “Keep it up and the flag is ours.”

“We’ll hand you a couple of runs to start off
with,” declared Larry, as he strode to the plate.

But neither in that inning nor in the next three,
did the promised runs come in. Hamilton, the
Chicago pitcher, was at his best, and his famous
drop ball was working to perfection. It seemed
as though the game were going to resolve itself
into a duel between the pitchers, and the crowd
held its breath as man after man went down before
the rival boxmen.

“Isn’t he a wizard?” exclaimed McRae, as Joe
mowed the enemy down as fast as they came to
the plate. “They’re so much putty in his hands.
That rise ball of his has a jump on it that’s got
those fellows buffaloed. They miss it by six
inches.”

“And his fadeaway,” put in Robson. “Do you
see how he mixes it in with the fast ones? He’s
outguessing them all the way.”

Joe’s heart was beating high with elation. The
sense of mastery thrilled him. He was absolutely
in control of all his curves. They broke just
where he wanted them. The Chicagos knew that
their only chance was to rattle him, and their
coachers danced up and down on the side lines,[239]
hurling out jibes and jeers that they hoped would
“get under his skin.” But they fell away from
him like water from a duck’s back.

But in the fifth inning the Giants “cracked.”

Denton, at third, fumbled an easy roller and
when at last he had stopped juggling the ball, he
threw over the first baseman’s head and the batter
got to third on the error. The fielders played
close in to get him at the plate, but a “Texas
leaguer” that Larry could easily have gobbled if
he had been in his usual position, dropped behind
him and the man on third came home for the first
run of the game.

The next man up rapped a fly to right, that
Curry lost in the sun, and made the round of the
bases, driving his comrade in ahead of him. Three
runs to the good for the Chicagos and not one of
them earned!

Joe put on steam and fanned the rest of the
side, but the damage had been done. In so close
a game as that, three runs seemed like a winning
lead.

McRae was raging, and stormed among his
players like a cyclone as they came in to bat.

“Get after them!” he cried, furiously. “Give
Matson something to go on. Your bats have
holes in them. You’re hitting like a lot of old
women. Knock the ball out of the lot. We’ve
got to win.”

[240]

They made a gallant effort and got two men on
bases. But although they hit the ball hard a Chicago
fielder always seemed to be in front of it.

The sixth inning was full of thrills and it looked
for a time as though the New Yorks would score,
and score heavily.

Joe had got through the first half with nothing
against him but a base on balls&mdash;a decision which
led to an acrimonious discussion between McRae
and the umpire in which the scrappy manager narrowly
escaped being ordered off the field.

In the Giant’s half, Iredell, the first man up, was
given his base on balls. McRae thought he detected
signs of wobbling on Hamilton’s part and
began to “ride” him from the first base side lines.
Larry, who was coaching at third, ably seconded
his chief, and the crowd joined in trying to make
the pitcher “crack.”

Hamilton was a veteran and used to such tactics,
and ordinarily they would not have affected
him. But there was so much at stake on this game
and the strain up to now had been so tremendous
that for a moment he faltered and passed the second
man.

The yells of the crowd increased at this, nor
was his agitation lessened when McRae entered a
vehement protest against his delivery, claiming
that he lifted his foot from the ground when releasing
the ball.

[241]

There was some ground for this and the umpire
cautioned Hamilton, who by this time was plainly
rattled. He pulled himself together, though, and
made the next batter put up a high fly to short.

The next man went out on strikes and Chicago
breathed more easily. But Hamilton was not yet
himself and a third pass filled the bases.

The crowd was crazed with excitement now, and
Meyers, the next man up, was entreated to “kill
the ball” as he came to the plate.

There were “two and three” on him when at
last he got the ball he wanted. It left his bat with
the crack of a bullet and soared high in the air
toward center. It had all the earmarks of a home
run and the crowd went wild, while the three men
on bases tore around them toward the plate like
so many runaway horses.

On, on, the ball went as though it were going
clear to the fence. But Lange, than whom there
was no swifter center fielder in either of the major
leagues, had started for it at the crack of the bat,
running with his back to the ball and looking back
over his shoulder from time to time to gauge its
course. At the last second he leaped high in the
air, clutched the ball with one hand, and fell to the
ground, rolling over and over, but coming up still
holding on to the ball.

A groan rose from the New York bench and
the yells of the jubilant crowd in the stands were[242]
suddenly stilled. It was hard to have their soaring
hopes so suddenly brought to earth. But it
was a magnificent play, and generous applause
greeted the center fielder as he came in to be
hugged and pawed by his exulting comrades.

At the “lucky seventh” the crowd rose and
stretched loyally but in vain. Only two more innings
remained and the crowds were like mourners
at a funeral.

Five minutes later they were shouting and
screaming like maniacs.

It was the last half of the eighth, and the
Giants’ turn had come. Larry led off with a rattling
two base hit to right. Denton sacrificed him
to third. Curry lined out a single to center, bringing
Larry home. He stole second by a close margin.
Byrnes clipped a two bagger just inside the
third base line, and Willis cleaned up by lacing a
three bagger between left and center. The score
was tied and the crowd promptly went mad. The
next two men went out in order, and the Chicagos,
sore and raging, came in for their last time at
bat.

But Joe felt now that he had the strength of
ten. The ball shot over the plate like a bullet and
not a man reached first.

“Now for the World’s Series, boys!” encouraged
McRae. “Now for fifty thousand dollars!
Here’s where you win it!”

[243]

But it was the tail of the batting order that
was coming up now. The first two men were
easy outs and then Joe came to the plate.

“It looks like an extra inning game,” was the
remark that went around the stands.

Like all pitchers, Joe was only a moderately
good batter and his average hovered around the
two hundred mark.

Perhaps on this account Hamilton was too confident,
for he took a chance and put one over “in
the groove.” Joe caught it square on the end of
the bat and the ball sailed far away into right
over the fielder’s head.

Joe was off with the crack of the bat. He
rounded first like a frightened jackrabbit and
straightened out for second. The ground fell
away from under his flying feet. He was running
like the wind. He heard the frantic roar of
the crowds, the yells of the coachers. On he went
toward third, touched it and thundered down to
the plate. He knew the ball was coming, he saw
the catcher set himself. Twenty feet from home
he launched himself into the air and slid into the
rubber, just eluding the catcher’s outstretched
hand.

The game was over, the Giants had won the
pennant, and had put themselves in line for the
great Series that would decide the championship
of the world!

[244]

How they came through that ordeal will be told
in our next volume entitled: “Baseball Joe in the
World’s Series; Or, Pitching for the Championship.”

Joe could never quite remember just what happened
for the next few minutes. The gleeful
shouts of his team-mates, the rush and roar of
the great crowd that surged down upon him, the
tugging and pulling that seemed to be rending him
apart&mdash;all this he sensed but dimly. He only
knew that he was blissfully, supremely happy. He
had played his part gallantly. He had made good
on the Giants. He had won the flag!

But had he not won more than that? Was he
not now free to speak? He touched the little
glove that lay in his pocket.

He dressed as rapidly as he could and emerged
with Jim into the street. He hailed a passing
taxi.

“Where are you going, Joe?” asked Jim.

“Going?” repeated Joe. “I’m going straight
to the Marlborough Hotel.”

who loves to play baseball and is particularly
anxious to make his mark as a pitcher. A
splendid picture of the great national game
in the smaller towns of our country.


Baseball Joe on the School Nine

school and play on the school team. He
got to boarding school but found it harder making the team
there than it was getting on the nine at home.

He makes the freshman nine and in his second year
becomes a varsity pitcher and pitches in several big games.


Baseball Joe in the Central League

work in the box for Old Eli had been noted by one of the
managers and Joe gets an offer he cannot resist.


Baseball Joe in the Big League
or A Young Pitcher’s Hardest Struggle

From the Central League Joe is drafted into the St. Louis
Nationals. At first he has little to do in the pitcher’s box, but
gradually he wins favor. A corking baseball story that fans,
both young and old, will enjoy.


Baseball Joe on the Giants (New)

How Joe was traded to the Giants and became their mainstay

The Y. M. C. A. Boys Series

By BROOKS HENDERLEY

12mo. Cloth. Illustrated. Price per volume, 60 cents, postpaid.





This new series relates the doings of a
wide-awake boys’ club of the Y. M. C. A.,
full of good times and every-day, practical
Christianity. Clean, elevating and
full of fun and vigor, books that should
be read by every boy.


The Y. M. C. A. Boys of Cliffwood
or The Struggle for the Holwell Prize

Telling how the boys of Cliffwood were a wild set and how,
on Hallowe’en, they turned the home town topsy-turvy. This
led to an organization of a boys’ department in the local
Y. M. C. A. When the lads realized what was being done for
them, they joined in the movement with vigor and did all they
could to help the good cause. To raise funds they gave a minstrel
show and other entertainments, and a number of them
did their best to win a gold medal offered by a local minister
who was greatly interested in the work of upbuilding youthful
character.


The Y. M. C. A. Boys on Bass Island
or The Mystery of Russabaga Camp

Summer was at hand, and at a meeting of the boys of the
Y. M. C. A. of Cliffwood, it was decided that a regular summer
camp should be instituted. This was located at a beautiful
spot on Bass Island, and there the lads went boating, swimming,
fishing and tramping to their heart’s content. There
were a great many surprises, but in the end the boys managed
to clear up a mystery of long standing. Incidentally, the volume
gives a clear insight into the workings of the now justly
popular summer camps of the Y. M. C. A., throughout the
United States.

White Ribbon Boys Series

By RAYMOND SPERRY, Jr.

12mo. Cloth. Illustrated. Price per volume, 60 cents, postpaid.





This new series deals with the great
modern movement for temperance. Clean-cut,
up-to-date stories that will please all
growing boys and girls and do them a
world of good.


The White Ribbon Boys of Chester
or The Old Tavern Keeper’s Secret

Chester was a typical factory town with its quota of drinking
places. The father of one of the boys was a foreman in
one of the factories, and he advocated temperance so strongly
that some of the men, urged on by an old tavern keeper,
plotted so that he lost his position. One day, when partly
intoxicated, the tavern keeper’s son climbs in a factory window,
smashes things, and is badly burned by acid. He is
rescued by the boys who are advocating temperance, who
take him to his mother. When the tavern keeper sees the
condition of his son, he breaks down, and confesses to the plot
against the discharged foreman. Temperance wins out, and
the town of Chester becomes far more prosperous than ever
before.


The White Ribbon Boys at Long Shore
or To the Rescue of Dan Bates

In this tale the scene is shifted to the seashore, where the
boys are having a vacation for the summer. Encouraged by
the temperance work done in their home town, they join a
local crusade to close the various drinking and gambling
houses. They fall in with another lad, the son of a well-known
drunkard of the summer resort, and do all they can to
aid him. A good, clean-cut boys’ story, full of life and action,
not at all preachy, but teaching the best of morals.

The Motor Boys
SECOND SERIES

(Trade Mark, Reg. U. S. Pat. Of.)

By CLARENCE YOUNG

12mo. Illustrated. Price per volume, 60 cents, postpaid.





This, the Second Series of the now
world famed Motor Boys virtually starts
a new series, but retains all the favorite
characters introduced in the previous
books. The Motor Boys Series is the
biggest and best selling series of books
for boys ever published.

Ned, Bob and Jerry at Boxwood Hall
or The Motor Boys as Freshmen

Fresh from their adventures in their automobile, their
motor boat and their airship, the youths are sent to college to
complete their interrupted education. Some boys at the institution
of learning have heard much about our heroes, and so
conclude that the Motor Boys will try to run everything to suit
themselves.

A plot is formed to keep our heroes entirely in the background
and not let them participate in athletics and other contests.
How the Motor Boys forged to the front and made warm
friends of their rivals makes unusually interesting reading.

Every Boy’s Mechanical Library

By J. S. ZERBE, M.E.

Price, per volume, 60 cents, Net. Postage extra.


AUTOMOBILES

This is a subject in which every boy is interested. While few
mechanics have the opportunity to actually build an automobile,
it is the knowledge which he must acquire about every particular
device used, that enables him to repair and put such machines in
order. The aim of this book is to make the boy acquainted with
each element, so that he may understand why it is made in that
special way, and what the advantages and disadvantages are of
the different types. To that end each structure is shown in
detail as much as possible, and the parts separated so as to
give a clear insight of the different functions, all of which are
explained by original drawings specially prepared to aid the reader.


MOTORS

To the boy who wants to know the theory and the practical
working of the different kinds of motors, told in language which
he can understand, and illustrated with clear and explicit drawings,
this volume will be appreciated. It sets forth the groundwork
on which power is based, and includes steam generators, and
engines, as well as wind and water motors, and thoroughly describes
the Internal Combustion Engine. It has special chapters
on Carburetors, Ignition, and Electrical systems used, and particularly
points out the parts and fittings required with all devices
needed in enginery. It explains the value of compounding,
condensing, pre-heating and expansion, together with the methods
used to calculate and transmit power. Numerous original illustrations.


AEROPLANES

This work is not intended to set forth the exploits of aviators
nor to give a history of the Art. It is a book of instructions intended
to point out the theories of flying, as given by the pioneers,
the practical application of power to the various flying structures;
how they are built; the different methods of controlling them;
the advantages and disadvantages of the types now in use; and
suggestions as to the directions in which improvements are required.
It distinctly points out wherein mechanical flight differs
from bird flight, and what are the relations of shape, form, size
and weight. It treats of kites, gliders and model aeroplanes,
and has an interesting chapter on the aeroplane and its uses in
the great war. All the illustrations have been specially prepared
for the work.

CUPPLES &amp; LEON CO., Publishers, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEW YORK









The Webster Series

By FRANK V. WEBSTER





Mr. Webster’s style is very much like
that of the boys’ favorite author, the late

are thoroughly up-to-date.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
