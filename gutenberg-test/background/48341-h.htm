<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<hr class="r5" />
<p>These roentgenograms are not presented as exhibiting a state of
perfection in the art or method by which they were produced, although
they show the results of some of the best and most modern apparatus of
Europe employed in the hands of very skillful operators. Some plates
are included which are indistinct and generally so unsatisfactory from
a technical viewpoint as to be of little interest, if all of them
were not intended to show the general character of the diagnostic
assistance that the roentgenologist rendered the military surgeon in
the base hospitals of Constantinople during the Turko-Balkan War.</p>

<p>The collection of these plates resulted from a systematic visiting
of the hospitals of Constantinople in the winter of 1912-13, during
the course of the first Balkan War, and including all of the military
hospitals of the military zone, with the incidental purpose of
selecting from the roentgenographic plates, which had been prepared
wherever apparatus was installed, such examples of the roentgenography
of gunshot wounds as might show characteristic lesions without
relation to detailed clinical record.</p>

<p>More than 1,500 plates were examined, and from them more than 200 were
selected as exhibiting some lesion that seemed to be characteristic of
some form of gunshot wound, even though the case history could not be
obtained. From these selected plates photographic prints were made. As
some of these photographs displayed somewhat similar conditions, only
162 of them are herewith produced.</p>

<p>As the photographic and reproduction processes have transferred the
rights and lefts of the original negatives several times, the plates
as they appear here are interpreted, for right and left, as though
they were the original photographic plates, which are physically
positive although they are chemically negative; i. e., the right and
left sides of the page should be read as the right and left sides
anatomically. If this distinction be not observed, some confusion may
arise from the habit of roentgenologists in regarding a roentgenograph
as a positive print of a negative plate.

<p>I regret that I can not here acknowledge by name my appreciation
and gratitude to the roentgenologists of all hospitals from which
I secured permission to reproduce their plates. To Prof. Wieting
Pasha, the commandant of Gulhané Hospital; to Dr. Ishmael Bey,
the roentgenologist of the Hamedian Hospital; to Dr. Englander,
the roentgenologist of the Austrian Hospital&mdash;to all of whom I am
particularly indebted&mdash;I wish to acknowledge my thanks.</p>

<p><i>Projectiles.</i>&mdash;The projectiles which figure in the illustrations
were those employed by the nations at war. They are derived (1) from
the Turkish pointed bullet weighing approximately 15.0 grams&mdash;it is
fired from the German Mauser and has all the ballistic values of the
projectile from this weapon; (2) the Bulgarian bullet, blunt nosed
or ogival headed and the same as the steel-jacketed bullet of the
Austrian Mannlicher; (3) shrapnel balls and fragments of the shrapnel,
and (4) fragments of steel shells from field artillery.</p>

<p>During the evolution of reduced caliber rifles experiments were made
on cadavers at different ranges. In the published writings of these
workers a great deal was said on the subject of highly destructive
effects which are pretty generally described as <i>explosive effects</i>.
The experimenters were careful to explain that these exaggerated and
highly destructive effects were only seen when firing into cadavers
at close ranges and when the bullet traveling at a maximum velocity
happened to collide with resistant structures like the compact
substance of bone in the diaphysis of the long bones, such as the
femur, tibia, humerus, etc., and the head, as well as organs loaded
with fluid or semifluid masses like the stomach, urinary bladder,
and intestines. In other tissues offering but little resistance like
lung tissues, soft parts generally, and epiphyseal ends of bone,
the wounds inflicted were considered humane in character. Attention
should be called to the infrequency of wounds showing explosive
effects by the rifles of reduced caliber employed in the Turko-Balkan
and Spanish-American wars. The same thing may be said of the
Turko-Italian, Anglo-Boer, and Russo-Japanese wars, all of which were
fought with the new armament.</p>

<p>The reason for the infrequency of the explosive effects in these
wars is due to the fact that the battles were fought in the open at
the ordinary battle ranges beyond the zone of explosive effects.
This fact is all the more emphasized in the present world war, in
which the rifle fire is employed principally in trench warfare at
near-by ranges, and where all the wounds which involve the resistant
structures of the body show the characteristic features usually
described as those of explosive effects.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>In describing the plates the terms used in connection with range are
as follows:</p>

<p class="no-indent">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(1) Close range, from 0 to 100 yards.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(2) Short range, from 100 to 500 yards.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(3) Mid range, from 500 to 1,000 yards.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(4) Long range, from 1,000 to 2,000 yards.</p>

<p>The wound effects of the modern military rifle bullet at various
ranges are usually classified as follows:</p>

<p class="no-indent">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(1) Explosive range, from 0 to 500 yards.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(2) Perforating range, from 500 to 1,500 yards.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(3) Penetrating range, from 1,500 to 2,500 yards.</p>

<p>The difficulty in adhering strictly to the last table as far as the
characteristic features of wounds are concerned is this: In battle the
chances of ricochetting of bullets is said to be in the proportion
of one to three. Naturally, the moment a bullet ricochets it loses
more or less of its remaining velocity. The destructive lesion to
be expected from a given shot at a given range against a certain
resistant structure can not be depended upon to occur as it will when
the shot is made with scientific accuracy in the shooting gallery
against cadavers.</p>

<p><i>Trajectory</i>, or the curved line of flight of a projectile, has
nothing to do with its wound-producing quality, except to increase the
wound-producing frequency when it flattens and approaches the straight
line of sight, because it will then pass through a greater portion of
the space between the gun and the target, which may be occupied by
men, without going over their heads. The greater the velocity, the
flatter the trajectory becomes.</p>

<p>The American, German, and Turkish rifles, with about the same
trajectory, can be fired through a tube 24 inches in diameter at a
range of 500 yards, and the vertical rise of the curve of flight would
not hit the top of the tube. But where the range is increased to 1,000
yards it would be necessary to enlarge the tube to a tunnel, 15 feet
in diameter, in order to fire the bullet through it without striking
the top in its greatly increased curve in flight.</p>

<p><i>Velocity</i> is the principal factor of the wound-producing power of
the small-caliber bullet, although the latter quality is definitely
related to the cross-sectional area and weight as well as to the hard
metal jacket which preserves its form. The greater the velocity of any
particular bullet the more serious is its wound.</p>

<p><i>Energy</i>, as the resultant of the components of <i>weight</i> and
<i>velocity</i>, represents the <i>real</i> damaging quality, striking
force, or “punch” of a projectile, with a variation in wound effect as
the energy is distributed over the surface of the body, through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
cross-sectional area and the form of the point of the projectile, and
the elements of construction which a affect the preservation of its
shape. As the energy is expressed in the formula,</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<big>E = <span class="u">WV<sup>2</sup></span></big>&nbsp;&nbsp;,<br />
<big>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2<i>g</i></big></p>

<p class="no-indent">it is evident that the increase or decrease of the
velocity factor gives greater variation than the increase of weight.</p>

<p><i>Range</i> is important only as indicating the amount of <i>remaining
energy</i> which may be known to reside in the projectile at any stage
of its flight. Without reference to the ballistic condition (velocity,
weight, form, and construction, etc.) of a particular projectile,
<i>range</i> has no surgical significance. To the military surgeon,
however, it is a term of the greatest interest when these ballistic
conditions are known, as it gives him a very definite indication of
the remaining energy or the damaging effect of a projectile at the
different stages in its flight.</p>

<p>The remaining energy of the American “Springfield,” or German “S”
bullet, for instance, will pass it through the bodies of two men at
2,000 yards and an energy of 8 kilogram-meters, which remains at about
twice that distance, will cause a disabling wound.</p>

<p>Wound infections are more rare in campaign in the more sparsely
settled and rough countries with soldiers of the more primitive class,
simple domestic habits, and greater natural resistance.</p>

<p>Wound treatment should be primarily directed toward the control of
infection with only secondary regard for the correction of deformities
which should follow as a secondary measure after resolution is established.</p>

<p>All treatment should be based on principles applied in the following order:</p>

<p class="no-indent">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(1) Life saving.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(2) Restoration of function.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(3) Economy of the patient.</p>

<p>Amputation should be very rare.</p>

<p class="space-below2">Conservation to a degree that seems to be beyond the
experience and conception of the civil surgeon should always be practiced, as
reiterated by Delorme, who says: “In order to avoid the excess of
operative measures which has been seen in recent wars I am urged to
enjoin all potential military surgeons to practice almost uniform conservation.”

<p class="center"><b>HEAD.<br />Gunshot Fracture of the Skull,
with Lodgment of the Missile.</b></p>

<p>The bullet in this case was so badly deformed by ricochet that
part of both core and jacket were lost. While the appearance of the
shadow seems to indicate a direct impact of the nose of the bullet,
the line of contact with the skull must have been tangential, with
some laceration of the scalp; otherwise a cursory examination of the
scalp wound would have revealed the slightly protruding end of the
bullet. The dark shadow above the projectile is due to material used
in dressing. The great thickening of the scalp in the region of the
wound shows a marked cellulitis. Small particles of the lead core of
the bullet can be seen about the wound.</p>

<p>In such cases there is often a marked infection of the scalp
without extension of infection to the cranial cavity, except from
neglect. This is a case, though apparently simple, in which the
radiograph was necessary for correct diagnosis without exploration.</p>

<p>The treatment in such cases is conservative, with removal of
the projectile and care of the superficial infection or subsequent complications.

<p>The Bulgarian Mannlicher bullet, shown half actual size on the plate,
must be inclined on its long axis, about 30° from the perpendicular,

<p>The slight penetration of the missile and its normal character show
that, having struck no intervening object, it indicted the wound at

<p>The course of the bullet was almost tangential to the ramus of the
jaw, anteroposteriorly. The slight fragmentation, which is hardly
more than a splitting of the bone, with little or no displacement,
indicates that the wound was made by a rifle bullet at moderate

<p>The wound was made by a rifle bullet with the velocity of long range,

without lodgment or without marks of lead.</p>

<p>The damage of the bone was very slight, as only a superficial fragment
was chipped off. There were no signs of primary infection. Reaction
and periostitis suggested the radiograph after infection had rarefied
the fragment, shown but very faintly on the left side of the plate.</p>

backward.</p>

<p>Wound of exit, with extensive laceration, beneath lower border of the
bone.</p>

<p>The wound was caused by a rifle bullet at high velocity at or less
than mid range. The fragments are many and rather small, so that much
bone was lost through the wound of exit. This effect was produced by
the splitting due to the relative friability of the bone and to the
imparting of the momentum of the missile to the detached fragments,
which, together with the missile, effected the considerable laceration
of the wound of exit.</p>

<p>Treatment, difficult; guided by septic conditions and surgical means
available.</p>

of the Missile in the Lumbar Muscles.</b></p>

<p>The bullet is lodged deep in the muscles of the back and not in the
abdomen, as determined by inspection of the plate.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The shadow of the bullet is enlarged laterally, because, while
on the side of the body next to the plate and to the spine, it is at
some little distance from the plate, which accounts for the larger
diameter of the shadow; and it is shortened longitudinally, because
its long axis is inclined at an angle to the plate.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The outline of the shadow is distinct, an evidence that
it is extra-abdominal, as otherwise its outline would be blurred by
the diaphragmatic movement of respiration imparted to the abdominal
viscera during the Röntgen exposure.

<p class="center"><b>SPINAL REGION.<br />Gunshot Wound of the Spinal Region,

<p>The bullet was either dum-dummed or unjacketed because its soft nose
mushroomed, striking the crest of the ilium, penetrated the lumbar
muscles, and struck the side body of the third lumbar vertebra without
producing fracture.</p>

<p>The exposure, as the spinous processes show, was made with the spine
next to the plate, and the slight shadow, somewhat larger than the
projectile&mdash;to judge the size from the undeformed diameter&mdash;shows
it to be anterior to the vertebra. The shadow is deep enough to indicate
the location fairly near to the plate, and, almost certainly, not in
the abdominal cavity, where the distance from the plate would have
made the shadow less dense and the movement of respiration probably
would have given it a blurred outline. The shadow of the localizing
cross gives a standard of density to be compared with the shadow of
the projectile in making the estimation.</p>

<p>The treatment is conservative; only pain, paralysis, impaired
function, or sepsis indicate interference.

<p>The shadow of the missile shows by its distinct outline and normal

the shortened length of the projectile indicates that the long axis
lay in an acute angle with a perpendicular to the plate.</p>

<p>The irregular outline of the base of the shadow and the fact of

of the same energy carried by a larger cross section would have
produced larger fragments.</p>

<p>In this case the location of the shrapnel ball would furnish
unquestioned evidence; or, if a shrapnel ball had produced this

been marked by traces of lead. Two metal fragments indicate that the

the arm.</p>

<p>The ballistic conditions and lines of force applied to the bone
were somewhat, if not entirely, similar to those producing the
fracture shown in <a href="#Page_32">plate 11</a>. The missile struck
the wall of the shaft without passing through the medullary canal, but
a secondary fragmentation of the two large fragments did not follow
except for the breaking of the tip of the distal fragment.</p>

<p>The range was long.</p>

<p>There was little deformity and no infection.</p>

<p>Plaster dressing was applied and the slight outline of callus
formation indicates the process of repair. The lack of contrast in
the shadow of the bone is due to the opacity of the plaster dressing
through which the Roentgen exposure was made.</p>

<p>The bullet mushroomed when it struck the bone with a “soft nose,” in
which the lead was not protected by a tough metal jacket. It may have
been dum-dummed; it is remotely possible that the nose of the jacket
was split by ricochet, or it is more probable that it was of the
unjacketed variety.</p>

<p>The effect is identical with that of a shrapnel ball, striking with
its normal low velocity, which is about the same as that of the

those of a shrapnel wound, as the projectile has struck the bone

the striking energy was relatively low and that the elastic tissues,
stretching around the missile at its striking point, contracted after
its energy had been expended and then withdrew the missile from its

<p>Wound of exit, large laceration in front and above the internal condyle.</p>

<p>The wound is an example of the misnamed “explosive” action of a rifle
bullet. The force and direction of the missile, in high velocity,
split the bone into many fragments, and, transmitting its energy to
some of the fragments, carried them through the skin and caused the
large laceration at the point of exit by the simultaneous escape of
the bullet and fragments. The wound was so heavily infected, that a
cellulitis advanced to the shoulder and to the wrist to such extent
that the arm was marked by eminent surgical opinion for amputation.
Free incision, drainage, antisepsis and incidental removal of detached
fragments controlled the infection and brought about slow resolution.
After six months of careful treatment the wound was healed with an
ankylosed elbow with normal function of the forearm, except for
limited rotation.</p>

<p>Treatment indicated in such cases is always conservative. Infections
contraindicate any formal surgical interference. The dangers of
infection in such cases are to be risked to avoid amputation.</p>

<p>The course of the missile was diagonally transverse, striking the
radius in its lower third.</p>

<p>The projectile in this case is unknown, as it might have been either a
shrapnel ball or a deformed rifle bullet with a torn jacket, exposing
the lead core and marking its course with small particles of lead.</p>

<p>The fissures in the lower fragment and the finer fragmentation at the
seat of impact, indicate a great striking energy, that more often
resides in the high velocity of a rifle bullet than the low velocity
of a shrapnel ball. The wound is therefore classified with rifle wounds.</p>

<p>The treatment is conservative. The course in such cases, without
infection, is very favorable, and not unfavorable even with infection.</p>

<p>Results should be good.

<p>The range was described as “close”&mdash;within a hundred yards&mdash;with
the bullet in high velocity. The energy of the projectile, imparted to
small fragments of cancellous tissue, drove them through the wound
of exit, and caused the laceration of the superficial tissues. The
wound was infected (swelling of soft parts clearly shown): resolution
followed extended treatment, with ankylosis of the wrist and radial
displacement of the carpus.</p>

without exploration or manipulation of fragments, and with splint
immobilization.</p>

<p>The course of the missile was from within outward, ranging downward to
the wrist, by deflection, after striking the ulna in its upper half.
The considerable striking energy retained in a small portion of the
mass&mdash;consisting of only the nose and a little more of the jacket of
the bullet, but sufficient to fragment a large section of the bone,
and then to traverse more than half the length of the forearm&mdash;leaves
no doubt that the shot was fired at very close range, and that the
bullet was broken on a nearly resisting surface, leaving in the nose
of the bullet a striking force equal to that of the entire projectile
at long range.</p>

<p>The posterior surface of the forearm is next to the plate, as the
distinct outline of the styloid process of the ulna and the posterior
border of the articular surface of the radius shows. The radius and
ulna are parallel in the most natural position of supination. The
normal diameter and sharp outline of the nose of the bullet show it to
be next to the plate and on the posterior surface between radius and ulna.</p>

<p>Fragments of the exposed lead core of the bullet have scraped off on
the line of fracture in a manner peculiar to shrapnel wounds, but
never seen in bullet wounds in which the jacket covers all of the lead core.</p>

<p>The treatment is regularly conservative and without interference, as
in this particular wound, which was aseptic.</p>

joint, after four months’ treatment, which was even more marked two
months later, when the case was discharged with an ankylosis of the

slight flexor function of the thumb, permitting apposition with the
first finger.</p>

and a search for the missile is only justified by serious infection,
pain, or impaired function.

<p>There is no injury of the bone in this case, as the bullet lodged in
the muscles posterior to the lower third of the femur without striking
the bone. The lighter circular area of the larger end of the shadow
of the projectile shows that its base is farther from the plate than
its nose, which was probably flattened and bent by the ricochet which
reduced its velocity so as to give it but slight power of penetration.</p>

<p>It is not easy to determine from inspection of the plate which side of
the leg lay next to the plate.</p>

<p>With a history of the wound of the right thigh and with the outside
of the leg next to the plate, the projectile must have lain near the
plate on the outside behind the lower end of the femur, midway between
the skin and bone.</p>

<p>The markings seen on the bone are not concerned with the wound, as the
same effect in the plate is seen in the areas beside the bone.</p>

<p>There is no injury to the bone. The large diameter, shortened length,
and slight density of the shadow show the bullet to be some distance
from and inclining toward the plate and lodged in the muscles behind
the femur, nearer the side away from the photographic plate. It is
difficult to identify the right or left thigh from the radiograph, but
with the history of the wound in the right thigh and the outside of
the leg next to the plate the ball would lie nearer the inside than
the outside of the thigh, nearer the surface behind the femur. As the
shadow shows irregular outline and the location of the bullet low
velocity, the wound was caused by a ricochet shot at very long range.</p>

<p>The treatment is expectant and the course naturally favorable.

<p class="center"><b>LOWER EXTREMITY.<br />Gunshot Wound of the Thigh,<br />
with Lodgment of the Missile.</b></p>

<p>As there is no injury to the bone, the bullet is not deformed. Its
penetrating power was not great enough to carry it through the tissue
so it must have struck the leg at extreme range when its energy was
almost spent.</p>

<p>The actual length of the bullet is 1.25 inches; the length of the
shadow is about 1.50 inches.</p>

<p>The increased length and the relatively slight density of the shadow
indicate the bullet to be some distance from the plate. The case
history places the wound in the right thigh, and the posterior surface
of the leg lay next to the photographic plate. As the density of the
shadow is not greater than the thickest portion of the bone, the
bullet probably lies in front of the border of the outer tuberosity of
the femur.</p>

<p>Although the surgeon’s diagnosis had to be made from the only
available plate, there is something of a speculative element in these
deductions, because if the reaction in the knee joint prevented the
patient from extending the leg the increased length of the bullet
shadow could be accounted for by this position, which would permit the
bullet to lie behind the bone and yet far enough from the plate to
account for the shadow enlargement. The nose of the bullet is at
the epiphyseal line, which is shown in the femur.

<p>The course of the bullet was antero-posterior and diagonally inward
from the antero-external border of upper third of the thigh. A thin
longitudinal fragment was split off without transverse fracture.</p>

<p>The missile struck the thigh after its energy had been greatly
reduced by ricocheting as a result of striking a resisting object
which flattened its nose and “set up” its body, as shown by the wavy
outlines of the shadows.</p>

<p>The dense and normal-size shadow shows the bullet to be near the plate
and probably in the muscles superficially behind and below the lesser
trochanter.</p>

<p>As the prominent outline of the lesser trochanter shows that the
leg was in external rotation when the negative was made, it is
evident that, with the rotation back to the anatomical position, the
projection of the shadow of the bullet would fall close to or in line
with the shaft of the femur; the position of the bullet is behind the
femur.</p>

<p>The course of the bullet was from within outward, striking the
posterior surface of the tibia about 2 inches above the ankle, and
causing a slight crack in the bone at the point where its course was
deflected.</p>

<p>The velocity was that of extreme range, as the wholly normal outline
of the projectile and the slight penetration indicates that its energy
was almost entirely lost in flight and not by ricochet.</p>

<p>The sharp outlines of the lower border of the fibula and the external
border of the articular surface of the lower end of the tibia indicate
the position of the fibula as next to the photographic plate.</p>

<p>The bullet lies at a very slight angle with the plate, as is shown
by the curved outline of its base, which condition alone would give a
projection shadow somewhat shorter than the bullet. But as the shadow
is actually somewhat longer than the bullet (about one-eighth inch,
or one-tenth its length), the position of the bullet is some distance
from the plate and most probably lies behind the tibia, at the inside of the fibula.

<p>The distinct outline and practically normal size of ball shows that

received from the service of Prof. De Page, of the Belgian Red Cross
Mission, at Josh Keshla Hospital, Constantinople, after an operation
for infections of the frontal sinus, in which the anterior table was
entirely removed, with free drainage into the posterior nares, before
the radiograph was made or the exact location of the ball suspected.
The missile is seen in the nares&mdash;very near the face&mdash;probably in
the middle meatus, in the inferior turbinates, against the septum,
deviated by its lodgment.</p>

<p>Convalescence was finally established and the frontal-sinus wound
practically closed when, without any subjective symptoms, an
obstruction was objectively determined in the left posterior nares,
suggesting the radiograph.</p>

<p>The patient was so entirely free from any symptoms of the lodged
missile that he wisely refused any meddlesome interference. He was
discharged with sinus wound closed very remarkably without indication

that of low velocity.</p>

<p>The great radiographic penetration shown in this plate gives the
shadows of the ball great distinctness and definite outline,
especially in the line of fracture, although its opposite border
is not in such sharp contrast. This appearance, together with the
very slight enlargement, leads to the suspicion that the ball lies
posteriorly, but a larger metal fragment, below the ball, is less
clear and suggests a position anterior to the bone. With the posterior
surface of the arm next to the plate and with but little difference
in the distance from the plate to either the anterior or posterior

<p>The palm of the hand lies next to the plate. The ball is very slightly
enlarged and the small metal fragments are indistinct, indicating that
they and the ball lie on the back of the hand.</p>

<p>The ball struck the third knuckle and lodged beneath the skin between
the fourth and fifth metacarpals, fracturing both bones without
displacement of fragments. In the recent wound the condition would be
apparent, but after days of inflammatory reaction and infection, the
swelling is too great to make any determination by palpation.</p>

<p>The hand lay with the palmar surface next to the plate. The distinct
outline of the small metal fragments and the natural size of the
shadow of the undeformed shrapnel ball show that they lay on the
anterior side of the metacarpus. The arrangements of the metal
particles and bone fragments and the indication of the point of
entrance of one wound on the outer border of the metacarpal of the
thumb indicate the course of the balls to have been from the radial
to the ulna side of the palm. The undeformed ball, then, lies, most
probably, in front of the second metacarpal. The deformed ball shows,
in its enlarged shadow and not so distinct in outline as the normal
ball, that it is on the dorsal surface of the third and fourth metacarpals.</p>

<p>The undeformed ball caused the fracture of the phalanx and metacarpal
of the thumb; the deformed ball fractured the neck of the third
metacarpal; a ball which escaped from the wound and touched the base
of the first phalanx of the middle finger and fractured the first
phalanx of the little finger; and another ball, which glanced along
the anterior surface of the lower end of the shaft of the radius and
left a deposit of metal to mark its course, also escaped from the
ulnar border of the forearm at a point indicated in the plate.</p>

<p>Four balls were concerned with this wound; two of them have lodged
with some damage and two others have escaped, after inflicting a
slight injury. Multiple shrapnel wounds are common. It may be said
that the greater the number of balls lodged in a given area the less
the distance of the plane from the apex of the cone of dispersion of a
shrapnel discharge.</p>

<p>Several shrapnel balls, lodged in a small area without causing much
damage or exhibiting much power of penetration, indicate low velocity
at close range of shrapnel balls on discharge from the shrapnel envelope.</p>

<p>In a personal case, eight shrapnel balls were removed from a forearm.

<p>The course of the shrapnel ball was antero-posterior, with an impact
on the shaft of the femur, which fragmented both the ball and bone
through the imparting or the entire striking energy of the ball to the
bone by the lodgment of the ball. The sharp outline and density of
the shadows of the missile, in contrast with the dense shadows of the
bone, indicate that the missile lies closer to the plate than does the
bone, although the flattened ball does not permit a comparison between
its shadow and the normal size of the ball.</p>

<p>The advanced stage of convalescence is shown by the formation of callous.</p>

<p>The treatment in such cases is conservative and the results are good
if proper position can be maintained.

<p>The impact of the missile was delivered with the energy of high
(shrapnel) velocity at close range, as is indicated by the signs of
another shrapnel wound, just above the outer tuberosity (in the lower
left corner of the plate), where a deposit of metallic particle is evidenced.</p>

<p>The fragmentation of the missile, through its contact with the bone,
indicates the great striking force of a missile which ricocheted from
the bone. The general distribution of metallic particles through
a wound of this class indicates certainly that the missile was
unjacketed, and the destructive forces show that its sectional area
was relatively larger, i. e., a shrapnel ball.</p>

<p>The hard metal jacket of a rifle bullet would not give off its
particles in contact with the bone unless it were so greatly deformed
as to have almost entirely lost its jacket. In this state the energy
of a rifle ball must be so greatly reduced, through the violence of
ricochet, that it would not retain enough striking force to cause its
disintegration on impact with the bone. Besides, some particles of the
jacket could be identified, as they are always bent or twisted so that
their character is recognized in the shadow.

<p>The slight enlargement and moderate density of the shadow of the
projectile indicates a position a short distance from the plate. A
slight shadow dependent from the external condyle on the outside of
the ball and a metallic marking just outside of the upper contour of
the outer tuberosity indicate an injury to the joint and the path of
the ball from above the outer tuberosity into the joint capsule.</p>

<p>The probabilities are that the ball lies between the head of the tibia
and the patellar notch of the femur, but the absolute certainty of
this deduction must be supported by an exposure in a lateral plane,
which is shown in <a href="#Page_268">plate 129</a>.

<p>As the fibular shadow is about the normal size and clearly outlined,
the fibular side of the leg lay next to the plate.</p>

<p>As the shadow of the ball is dense and not much enlarged, it must lie
near the plate. A light shadow in front of the ball, which shows the
anterior crucial ligament, and a metallic marking above the patella,
suggests the path of the ball.</p>

<p>As this is a lateral projection of the same case that is shown in
<a href="#Page_266">plate 128</a> in an antero-posterior projection,
these conclusions are thus verified.</p>

<p>The missile lies in the joint capsule between the head of the tibia,
in front of the spine, and the patellar notch of the femur.</p>

<p>As a foreign body in the knee joint which seriously interferes with
its function, removal is indicated when surgical facilities are at hand.</p>

<p>The line of projection of the shadow is directed obliquely from
behind, focussed on the internal aspect of the knee, with the fibula
next to the plate. As the shadow of the shrapnel ball is much enlarged
and not very dense, the ball must lie some distance from the plate and
away from the fibular side of the joint. As the distances through the
knee joint are about the same in all cases and as shrapnel balls are
approximately the same size, it is evident that the ball lies farther
away from the plate than it does in <a href="#Page_268">plate 129</a>,
where it is about the middle of a transverse line through the joint.
It must lie, therefore, superficially between the head of the tibia
and the internal condyle of the femur.</p>

<p>Removal is indicated under favorable surgical conditions. Infection of
the joint may occasionally indicate drainage and removal as emergency treatment.</p>

<p>That the knee is not fully extended is shown by the exaggerated
outline of the tibial head.</p>

<p>The enlarged and only fair density of the shadow indicates that the
shrapnel ball lies some distance away from the plate. As the bone is
not injured, the missile must lie either in front of or behind the
femur, and its enlarged shadow shows the position to be in front of
the femur, just above the articular surface, and probably within the
reflection of the capsular ligament.</p>

<p>A comparison with the size of the shadows of the balls shown in plates
<a href="#Page_266">128</a> and <a href="#Page_270">130</a> will show this
one to be greater than the former and less than the latter, and so
it must bear about the same relation in the distance from the plate.
This would account for the location in front instead of behind the femur.</p>

<p>The line of projection is transversely through the tuberosities.</p>

<p>The shadow of the ball, as it is somewhat enlarged, not sharply

than the bone. An accurate localization of the ball in a transverse
line, however, would require an exposure of another plate in an
antero-posterior line, but in this actual case the localization of the
ball had to be made from this single plate, as only one exposure was made.</p>

<p>The ball struck the border of the popliteal space of the femur just

<p>The posterior surface of the leg lay next to the plate, as shown by
the outline of the head of the fibula, but any estimate of distance

because there is no contrast between localizing-wire shadows in front

<p>The slightly enlarged shadow of the ball indicates it to be farther
from the plate than it would be if it lay behind the fibula. As the
shadows of the metal fragments on the tibia are not sharp enough to
indicate their position to be near the plate, the ball has lodged
anteriorly between the tibia and fibula after ricocheting from the
anterior surface of the tibia. The ball, being undeformed, struck the
tibia with so little force that it barely penetrated the skin.</p>

and the very slight enlargement of the ball indicates a contact with
the anterior surface of the tibia and of the fibula with lodgment
of the ball beneath the skin at the anterior border of the lower

<p>This is another example of the condition, shown in <a href="#Page_296">plate 143</a>,
in which a shrapnel hall or similar missile is disintegrated by ricochet before
a fleeting the wound.</p>

<p>By comparison of the shadows of the missiles with the shadows of the
portion of the localizing wire lying nearer the plate (shown more
deeply and distinctly), and with the portion lying in front of the
leg, it can be concluded that the fragments lie superficially in front
of the bones.</p>

<p>A slight fissure fracture of the fibula may be seen in the upper
portion of the plate.

<p>The metallic particles marking the contact of the ball and the fibula,

<p>The course of the ball, therefore, was from without, ranging inward
and upward with the slight energy of long (shrapnel) range. The ball
lies on the fibular side superficially, just in front of the fibula.

<p>As the heel lay next to the photographic plate, the right ankle is
easily identified. The clear shadows of even the very small metallic
particles show them also next to the plate and, therefore, on the
posterior surface of the external malleolus, where a shrapnel ball at
extremely low velocity struck and produced a slight fracture, or more
of a fissure, without separation of fragment.</p>

<p>The joint mortise is intact, as the line of fracture does not extend
to the articular surface.</p>

<p>The shrapnel ball in such cases would lie just beneath the skin or
escape through an adjacent wound.

<p class="center"><b>LOWER EXTREMITY.<br />Gunshot (Pott’s) Fracture of the Left Ankle.</b></p>


<p>As the heel lies next to the plate, the left ankle is easily identified.</p>

<p>The course of the missile is shown by a metallic track from the
internal to the external malleolus, and by a point of greater contact
with the internal malleolus at the upper border of its articulation
with the astragulus, resulting in an oblique fracture, separating the
tip of the external malleolus.</p>

<p>At the point of first impact the posterior faciculus of the internal
lateral ligament was severed. The missile therefore passed directly
through the ankle joint, entering just behind the tip of the external
malleolus, coursing over the posterior portion of the superior tibial
articulation of the astragalus in front of the tendo Achillis to
strike the upper articular surface of the external malleolus, with
the resulting fracture. By this mechanism, the joint mortise has been
widened by outward displacement of the external malleolus, while
the rupture of the internal lateral ligament permitted the outward
rotation of the astragulus, thus producing rather faithfully, by
direct violence, a condition which might be called a “simulated Pott’s
fracture” of the first degree.</p>

<p>By the metallic path of the missile it is known that its soft metal
mass was not protected by a hard metal jacket; by the slight damage
done to the bone, which lay directly in its path, its velocity
and consequent energy are revealed as very slight; by the absence
of larger metallic fragments it is shown that the missile was not
deformed nor robbed of its energy through ricochet; and as only these
conditions can be furnished by a lead ball, undeformed and traveling
at low velocity, the missile was a shrapnel ball.

<p>This plate exhibits the characteristic marking of the metal particles
of a shrapnel ball scraped off by contact with the bone, showing the
course of the ball in relation to the bone.</p>

<p>The evidence that two shrapnel balls struck the tibia without
causing a fracture indicates that the velocity of shrapnel balls is,
sometimes at least, very low and that this low velocity may occur at
a comparatively short range from the point where the shrapnel balls
are discharged from the chamber or near the apex of the “cone of
dispersion.” Such multiple wounds are caused before the balls have
been so widely dispersed as when they arrive at the base of the “cone of dispersion.”

<p>As the metallic particles, showing the path of the missile, appear to

border of the tendo Achillis diagonally downward and forward, causing
only a slight fissure of the calcaneus. A missile, to have done so
little damage and to have left a metallic track showing its contact
with the bone, must have been unjacketed and of low velocity, and
therefore a shrapnel ball.

that the ball struck the convex, rather than the concave outline of

of the bones, which would have been very difficult in mechanical
accomplishment if its course had been along the convex outline.</p>

<p>There is no fracture of the bones, although a shrapnel ball has

<p>Even though the missile has escaped, its identity can be creditably
established by the one remaining, which, it is morally certain, was

demonstrate that the metal deposits seen in other wounds can be

<p>Four rifle bullets, three shrapnel balls, and Nos. 20 and 27 were
removed from Turkish soldiers admitted to my service at Tash Kishla
Hospital in Constantinople. The remaining missiles, excepting No. 46,
were removed from Bulgarian soldiers on my service at the Etap and the

was removed by Dr. Tatarcheff, the Bulgarian surgeon in command of a

a patient whose history I have and whom I saw and photographed.</p>

<p>Of the fragments, Nos. 15 and 17 are pieces of the nickel jacket of
rifle bullets; No. 16 is the lead “core” of a rifle bullet; No. 22 is
a fragment of the nickel jacket of a rifle bullet which holds a small
portion of the lead core; No. 18 is a brass tube which is carried
in the base of a shell to hold the detonating plunger and fulminate
cap; No. 19 is a piece of a foot plate or step of a gun carriage or
caisson; No. 20 is a shell fragment, and No. 21 is a flattened piece
of a shrapnel ball.</p>

<p>Of the bullets, No. 1 is Bulgarian, removed from a Bulgarian
soldier in an operation for an abdominal wound accidently inflicted

Nos. 2 and 3, slightly smaller in caliber than all the others, are
Greek, and Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, and 13 are Servian, slightly larger
than the Greek and as much smaller than the Bulgarian. No. 1 is
abraided at the base by the jaws of a forceps by which it was removed
from the wing of the ilium in which it was firmly embedded; Nos. 4, 7,
8, 12, 13, 14 are deformed by ricochet. No. 5 has its nose slightly

the base of the jacket. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, and 11 are normal, as
they struck the body by direct impact. Nos. 2 and 3, which are Greek,
have the nickel jacket worn off on the apex so that the lead core is
exposed, which produces a slight degree of “dum-dum,” but as they
struck the body at very long range and without hitting a bone, they
produced no “dum-dum” effect.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
