<p>No one can have reflected on the history of genius
without being impressed with a melancholy
feeling at the obscurity in which the lives of the
poets of our country are, with few exceptions,
involved. That they lived, and wrote, and died,
comprises nearly all that is known of many, and,
of others, the few facts which are preserved are
often records of privations, or sufferings, or errors.
The cause of the lamentable deficiency of materials
for literary biography may, without difficulty,
be explained. The lives of authors are seldom
marked by events of an unusual character; and
they rarely leave behind them the most interesting
work a writer could compose, and which
would embrace nearly all the important facts in
his career, a &ldquo;History of his Books,&rdquo; containing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vi' name='page_vi'></a>vi</span>
the motives which produced them, the various
incidents respecting their progress, and a faithful
account of the bitter disappointment, whether the
object was fame or profit, or both, which, in most
instances, is the result of his labours. Various
motives deter men from writing such a volume;
for, though quacks and charlatans readily become
auto-biographers, and fill their prefaces with their
personal concerns, real merit shrinks from such
disgusting egotism, and, flying to the opposite
extreme, leaves no authentic notice of their struggles,
its hopes, or its disappointments. Nor is
the history of writers to be expected from their
contemporaries; because few will venture to anticipate
the judgment of posterity, and mankind
are usually so isolated in self, and so jealous of
others, that neither time nor inclination admits of
their becoming the Boswells of all those whose
productions excite admiration.</p>
<p>If these remarks be true, surprise cannot be felt,
though there is abundance of cause for regret,
that little is known of a poet whose merits were
not appreciated until after his decease: whose
powers were destroyed by a distressing malady
at a period of life when literary exertions begin
to be rewarded and stimulated by popular applause.</p>
<p>For the facts contained in the following Memoir
of Collins, the author is indebted to the
researches of others, as his own, which were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vii' name='page_vii'></a>vii</span>
very extensive, were rewarded by trifling discoveries.
Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Life is well known; but
the praise of collecting every particular which
industry and zeal could glean belongs to the
Rev. Alexander Dyce, the result of whose inquiries
may be found in his notes to Johnson&rsquo;s
Memoir, prefixed to an edition of Collins&rsquo;s works
which he lately edited. Those notices are now,
for the first time, wove into a Memoir of Collins;
and in leaving it to another to erect a
fabric out of the materials which he has collected
instead of being himself the architect, Mr. Dyce
has evinced a degree of modesty which those who
know him must greatly lament.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p><span class='smcap'>William Collins</span> was born at Chichester,
on the 25th of December, 1721, and was baptized
in the parish church of St. Peter the Great,
alias Subdeanery in that city, on the first of the
following January. He was the son of William
Collins, who was then the Mayor of Chichester,
where he exercised the trade of a hatter, and
lived in a respectable manner. His mother was
Elizabeth, the sister of a Colonel Martyn, to whose
bounty the poet was deeply indebted.</p>
<p>Being destined for the church, young Collins
was admitted a scholar of Winchester College on
the 19th of January, 1733, where he was educated
by Dr. Burton; and in 1740 he stood first
on the list of scholars who were to be received at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_viii' name='page_viii'></a>viii</span>
New College. No vacancy, however, occurred,
and the circumstance is said by Johnson to have
been the original misfortune of his life. He became
a commoner of Queen&rsquo;s,<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> whence, on the
29th of July, 1741, he was elected a demy of
Magdalen College. During his stay at Queen&rsquo;s
he was distinguished for genius and indolence,
and the few exercises which he could be induced
to write bear evident marks of both qualities.
He continued at Oxford until he took his bachelor&rsquo;s
degree, and then suddenly left the University,
his motive, as he alleged, being that he
missed a fellowship, for which he offered himself;
but it has been assigned to his disgust at the
dulness of a college life, and to his being involved
in debt.</p>
<p>On arriving in London, which was either in 1743
or 1744, he became, says Johnson, &ldquo;a literary
adventurer, with many projects in his head and
very little money in his pocket.&rdquo; Collins was not
without some reputation as an author when he
proposed to adopt the most uncertain and deplorable
of all professions, that of literature, for
a subsistence. Whilst at Winchester school he
wrote his Eclogues, and had appeared before the
public in some verses addressed to a lady weeping
at her sister&rsquo;s marriage, which were printed in the
Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, Oct. 1739, when Collins
was in his eighteenth year. In January, 1742,
he published his Eclogues, under the title of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_ix' name='page_ix'></a>ix</span>
&ldquo;Persian Eclogues;&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> and, in December, 1743,
his &ldquo;Verses to Sir Thomas Hanmer on his Edition
of Shakespeare,&rdquo; appeared. To neither did
he affix his name, but the latter was said to be
by &ldquo;a Gentleman of Oxford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the time he settled in London, his mind
was more occupied with literary projects than
with steady application; nor had poesy, for
which Nature peculiarly designed him, sufficient
attractions to chain his wavering disposition. It
is not certain whether his irresolution arose from
the annoyance of importunate debtors, or from
an original infirmity of mind, or from these causes
united. A popular writer<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> has defended Collins
from the charge of irresolution, on the ground
that it was but &ldquo;the vacillations of a mind broken
and confounded;&rdquo; and he urges, that &ldquo;he
had exercised too constantly the highest faculties
of fiction, and precipitated himself into the dreariness
of real life.&rdquo; But this explanation does
not account for the want of steadiness which prevented
Collins from accomplishing the objects he
meditated. His mind was neither &ldquo;broken nor
confounded,&rdquo; nor had he experienced the bitter
pangs of neglect, when with the buoyancy of hope,
and a full confidence in his extraordinary powers,
he threw himself on the town, at the age of twenty-three,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_x' name='page_x'></a>x</span>
intending to live by the exercise of his
talents; but his indecision was then as apparent
as at any subsequent period, so that, in truth,
the effect preceded the cause to which it has
been assigned.</p>
<p>Mankind are becoming too much accustomed
to witness splendid talents and great firmness of
mind united in the same person to partake the
mistaken sympathy which so many writers evince
for the follies or vices of genius; nor will it
much longer tolerate the opinion, that the possession
of the finest imagination, or the highest
poetic capacity, must necessarily be accompanied
by eccentricity. It may, indeed, be difficult to
convert a poetical temperament into a merchant,
or to make the man who is destined to delight or
astonish mankind by his conceptions, sit quietly
over a ledger; but the transition from poetry to
the composition of such works as Collins planned
is by no means unnatural, and the abandonment
of his views respecting them must, in justice to
his memory, be attributed to a different cause.</p>
<p>The most probable reason is, that these works
were mere speculations to raise money, and that
the idea was not encouraged by the booksellers;
but if, as Johnson, who knew Collins well, asserts,
his character wanted decision and perseverance,
these defects may have been constitutional, and
were, perhaps, the germs of the disease which too
soon ripened into the most frightful of human
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xi' name='page_xi'></a>xi</span>
calamities. Endued with a morbid sensibility,
which was as ill calculated to court popularity as
to bear neglect; and wanting that stoical indifference
to the opinions of the many, which ought
to render those who are conscious of the value of
their productions satisfied with the approbation of
the few; Collins was too impatient of applause,
and too anxious to attain perfection, to be a voluminous
writer. To plan much rather than to execute
any thing; to commence to-day an ode, to-morrow
a tragedy, and to turn on the following
morning to a different subject, was the chief occupation
of his life for several years, during
which time he destroyed the principal part of the
little that he wrote. To a man nearly pennyless,
such a life must be attended by privations and
danger; and he was in the hands of bailiffs,
possibly not for the first time, very shortly before
he became independent by the death of his maternal
uncle, Colonel Martyn. The result proved
that his want of firmness and perseverance was
natural, and did not arise from the uncertainty
or narrowness of his fortune; for being rescued
from imprisonment, on the credit of a translation
of Aristotle&rsquo;s Poetics, which he engaged to furnish
a publisher, a work, it may be presumed, peculiarly
suited to his genius, he no sooner found
himself in the possession of money by the death
of his relative, than he repaid the bookseller, and
abandoned the translation for ever.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xii' name='page_xii'></a>xii</span></div>
<p>From the commencement of his career, Collins
was, however, an object for sympathy instead of
censure; and though few refuse their compassion
to the confirmed lunatic, it is rare that the
dreadful state of irresolution and misery, which
sometimes exist for years before the fatal catastrophe,
receives either pity or indulgence.</p>
<p>In 1747, Collins published his Odes, to the
unrivaled splendour of a few of which he is
alone indebted for his fame; but neither fame
nor profit was the immediate result; and the
author of the Ode on the Passions had little
reason to expect, from its reception by the
public, that it was destined to live as long as
the passions themselves animate or distract the
world.</p>
<p>It is uncertain at what time he undertook to
publish a volume of Odes in conjunction with
Joseph Warton, but the intention is placed beyond
dispute by the following letter from Warton
to his brother. It is without a date, but it
must have been written before the publication of
Collins&rsquo;s Odes in 1747, and before the appearance
of Dodsley&rsquo;s Museum,<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> as it is evident the
Ode to a Lady on the Death of Colonel Ross,
which was inserted in that work, was not then in
print.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xiii' name='page_xiii'></a>xiii</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Tom</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will wonder to see my name in an advertisement
next week, so I thought I would apprise
you of it. The case was this. Collins met me in
Surrey, at Guildford races, when I wrote out for
him my odes, and he likewise communicated
some of his to me; and being both in very high
spirits, we took courage, resolved to join our
forces, and to publish them immediately. I flatter
myself that I shall lose no honor by this
publication, because I believe these odes, as they
now stand, are infinitely the best things I ever
wrote. You will see a very pretty one of Collins&rsquo;s,
on the Death of Colonel Ross before Tournay.
It is addressed to a lady who was Ross&rsquo;s
intimate acquaintance, and who, by the way, is
Miss Bett Goddard. Collins is not to publish
the odes unless he gets ten guineas for them. I
returned from Milford last night, where I left
Collins with my mother and sister, and he sets
out to-day for London. I must now tell you,
that I have sent him your imitation of Horace&rsquo;s
Blandusian Fountain, to be printed amongst
ours, and which you shall own or not, as you
think proper. I would not have done this without
your consent, but because I think it very
poetically and correctly done, and will get you
honour. You will let me know what the Oxford
critics say. Adieu, dear Tom,</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;I am your most affectionate brother,<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>J. Warton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xiv' name='page_xiv'></a>xiv</span></div>
<p>Like so many of Collins&rsquo;s projects this was
not executed; but the reason of its failure is unknown.</p>
<p>On the death of Thomson, in August, 1748,
Collins wrote an ode to his memory, which is no
less remarkable for its beauty as a composition,
than for its pathetic tenderness as a memorial of
a friend.</p>
<p>The Poet&rsquo;s pecuniary difficulties were removed
in 1749, by the death of his maternal uncle,
Lieutenant-Colonel Edmund Martyn, who, after
bequeathing legacies to some other relations,
ordered the residue of his real and personal
estate to be divided between his nephew William
Collins, and his nieces Elizabeth and Anne Collins,
and appointed the said Elizabeth his executrix,
who proved her uncle&rsquo;s will on the 30th of
May, 1749. Collins&rsquo;s share was, it is said, about
two thousand pounds; and, as has been already
observed, the money came most opportunely: a
greater calamity even than poverty, however,
shortly afterwards counterbalanced his good fortune;
but the assertion of the writer in the Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine, that his mental aberration
arose from his having squandered this legacy,
appears to be unfounded.</p>
<p>One, and but one, letter of Collins&rsquo;s has ever
been printed; nor has a careful inquiry after
others been successful. It is of peculiar interest,
as it proves that he wrote an Ode on the Music
of the Grecian Theatre, but which is unfortunately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xv' name='page_xv'></a>xv</span>
lost. The honour to which he alludes was
the setting his Ode on the Passions to music.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='center'>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>TO DR. WILLIAM HAYES, PROFESSOR OF
MUSIC, OXFORD.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Mr. Blackstone</span> of Winchester some time
since informed me of the honour you had done
me at Oxford last summer; for which I return
you my sincere thanks. I have another more
perfect copy of the ode; which, had I known
your obliging design, I would have communicated
to you. Inform me by a line, if you should
think one of my better judgment acceptable. In
such case I could send you one written on a
nobler subject; and which, though I have been
persuaded to bring it forth in London, I think
more calculated for an audience in the university.
The subject is the Music of the Grecian Theatre;
in which I have, I hope naturally, introduced the
various characters with which the chorus was
concerned, as &OElig;dipus, Medea, Electra, Orestes,
etc. etc. The composition too is probably more
correct, as I have chosen the ancient tragedies
for my models, and only copied the most affecting
passages in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the mean time, you would greatly oblige
me by sending the score of the last. If you can
get it written, I will readily answer the expense.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xvi' name='page_xvi'></a>xvi</span>
If you send it with a copy or two of the ode (as
printed at Oxford) to Mr. Clarke, at Winchester,
he will forward it to me here. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;With great respect,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;Your obliged humble servant,<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>William Collins</span>.</p>
<p class='smaller'>&ldquo;Chichester, Sussex, November 8, 1750.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P. S. Mr. Clarke past some days here while
Mr. Worgan was with me; from whose friendship,
I hope, he will receive some advantage.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after this period, the disease which had
long threatened to destroy Collins&rsquo;s intellects
assumed a more decided character; but for some
time the unhappy poet was the only person who
was sensible of the approaching calamity. A
visit to France was tried in vain; and when Johnson
called upon him, on his return, an incident
occurred which proves that Collins wisely sought
for consolation against the coming wreck of his
faculties, from a higher and more certain source
than mere human aid. Johnson says, &ldquo;he paid
him a visit at Islington, where he was then
waiting for his sister, whom he had directed
to meet him: there was then nothing of disorder
discernible in his mind by any but himself; but
he had withdrawn from study, and travelled with
no other book than an English Testament, such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xvii' name='page_xvii'></a>xvii</span>
as children carry to the school: when his friend
took it into his hand, out of curiosity to see what
companion a man of letters had chosen, &lsquo;I have
but one book,&rsquo; said Collins, &lsquo;but that is the
best.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this circumstance Hayley beautifully alludes
in his epitaph on him:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>He, &ldquo;in reviving reason&rsquo;s lucid hours,</p>
<p>Sought on <i>one</i> book his troubled mind to rest,</p>
<p>And rightly deem&rsquo;d the Book of God the best.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>A journey to Bath proved as useless as the one
to France; and in 1754, he went to Oxford for
change of air and amusement, where he stayed a
month. It was on this occasion that a friend,
whose account of him will be given at length, saw
him in a distressing state of restraint under the
walls of Merton College. From the paucity of
information respecting Collins, the following letters
are extremely valuable; and though the
statements are those of his friends, they may be
received without suspicion of partiality, because
they are free from the high colouring by which
friendship sometimes perverts truth.</p>
<p>The first of the letters in question was printed
in the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Jan. 20, 1781.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Mr. Urban</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>William Collins</span>, the poet, I was intimately
acquainted with, from the time that he came to
reside at Oxford. He was the son of a tradesman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xviii' name='page_xviii'></a>xviii</span>
in the city of Chichester, I think a hatter;
and being sent very young to Winchester school,
was soon distinguished for his early proficiency,
and his turn for elegant composition. About the
year 1740, he came off from that seminary first
upon roll,<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> and was entered a commoner of
Queen&rsquo;s college. There, no vacancy offering for
New College, he remained a year or two, and
then was chosen demy of Magdalen college;
where, I think, he took a degree. As he brought
with him, for so the whole turn of his conversation
discovered, too high an opinion of his school
acquisitions, and a sovereign contempt for all
academic studies and discipline, he never looked
with any complacency on his situation in the
university, but was always complaining of the
dulness of a college life. In short, he threw up
his demyship, and, going to London, commenced
a man of the town, spending his time in all the
dissipation of Ranelagh, Vauxhall, and the playhouses;
and was romantic enough to suppose
that his superior abilities would draw the attention
of the great world, by means of whom he
was to make his fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this pleasurable way of life he soon wasted
his little property, and a considerable legacy left
him by a maternal uncle, a colonel in the army,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xix' name='page_xix'></a>xix</span>
to whom the nephew made a visit in Flanders
during the war. While on his tour he wrote
several entertaining letters to his Oxford friends,
some of which I saw. In London I met him
often, and remember he lodged in a little house
with a Miss Bundy, at the corner of King&rsquo;s-square-court,
Soho, now a warehouse, for a long
time together. When poverty overtook him,
poor man, he had too much sensibility of temper
to bear with misfortunes, and so fell into a
most deplorable state of mind. How he got
down to Oxford, I do not know; but I myself saw
him under Merton wall, in a very affecting situation,
struggling, and conveyed by force, in the
arms of two or three men, towards the parish of
St. Clement, in which was a house that took in
such unhappy objects: and I always understood,
that not long after he died in confinement; but
when, or where, or where he was buried, I never
knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus was lost to the world this unfortunate
person, in the prime of life, without availing himself
of fine abilities, which, properly improved,
must have raised him to the top of any profession,
and have rendered him a blessing to his
friends, and an ornament to his country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without books, or steadiness and resolution
to consult them if he had been possessed of any,
he was always planning schemes for elaborate
publications, which were carried no further than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xx' name='page_xx'></a>xx</span>
the drawing up proposals for subscriptions, some
of which were published; and in particular, as
far as I remember, one for &lsquo;a History of the
Darker Ages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was passionately fond of music; good-natured
and affable; warm in his friendships, and
visionary in his pursuits; and, as long as I knew
him, very temperate in his eating and drinking.
He was of moderate stature, of a light and clear
complexion, with gray eyes, so very weak at times
as hardly to bear a candle in the room; and often
raising within him apprehensions of blindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With an anecdote respecting him, while he
was at Magdalen College, I shall close my letter.
It happened one afternoon, at a tea visit, that
several intelligent friends were assembled at his
rooms to enjoy each other&rsquo;s conversation, when
in comes a member of a certain college,<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> as remarkable
at that time for his brutal disposition
as for his good scholarship; who, though he met
with a circle of the most peaceable people in the
world, was determined to quarrel; and, though
no man said a word, lifted up his foot and kicked
the tea-table, and all its contents, to the other
side of the room. Our poet, though of a warm
temper, was so confounded at the unexpected
downfall, and so astonished at the unmerited
insult, that he took no notice of the aggressor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxi' name='page_xxi'></a>xxi</span>
but getting up from his chair calmly, he began
picking up the slices of bread and butter, and
the fragments of his china, repeating very mildly,</p>

<p>The next letter was found among the papers of
Mr. William Hymers, of Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford,
who was preparing a new edition of the works of
the poet for publication, when death prevented
the completion of his design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='smaller ralign'>&ldquo;Hill Street, Richmond in Surrey, July, 1783.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your favour of the 30th June I did not receive
till yesterday. The person who has the care of
my house in Bond Street, expecting me there
every day, did not send it to Richmond, or I
would have answered sooner. As you express a
wish to know every particular, however trifling,
relating to Mr. William Collins, I will endeavour,
so far as can be done by a letter, to satisfy you.
There are many little anecdotes, which tell well
enough in conversation, but would be tiresome for
you to read, or me to write, so shall pass them
over. I had formerly several scraps of his poetry,
which were suddenly written on particular occasions.
These I lent among our acquaintance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxii' name='page_xxii'></a>xxii</span>
who were never civil enough to return them; and
being then engaged in extensive business, I forgot
to ask for them, and they are lost: all I have remaining
of his are about twenty lines, which
would require a little history to be understood,
being written on trifling subjects. I have a few
of his letters, the subjects of which are chiefly
on business, but I think there are in them some
flights, which strongly mark his character; for
which reason I preserved them. There are so
few of his intimates now living, that I believe I
am the only one who can give a true account of
his family and connexions. The principal part of
what I write is from my own knowledge, or what
I have heard from his nearest relations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father was not the manufacturer of hats,
but the vender. He lived in a genteel style at
Chichester; and, I think, filled the office of
mayor more than once; he was pompous in his
manner; but, at his death, he left his affairs
rather embarrassed. Colonel Martyn, his wife&rsquo;s
brother, greatly assisted his family, and supported
Mr. William Collins at the university,
where he stood for a fellowship, which, to his
great mortification, he lost, and which was his
reason for quitting that place, at least that was
his pretext. But he had other reasons: he was
in arrears to his bookseller, his tailor, and other
tradesmen. But, I believe, a desire to partake
of the dissipation and gaiety of London was his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxiii' name='page_xxiii'></a>xxiii</span>
principal motive. Colonel Martyn was at this
time with his regiment; and Mr. Payne, a near
relation, who had the management of the colonel&rsquo;s
affairs, had likewise a commission to supply
the Collinses with small sums of money. The
colonel was the more sparing in this order, having
suffered considerably by Alderman Collins, who
had formerly been his agent, and, forgetting that
his wife&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s cash was not his own, had applied
it to his own use. When Mr. William Collins
came from the university, he called on his cousin
Payne, gaily dressed, and with a feather in his hat;
at which his relation expressed surprise, and told
him his appearance was by no means that of a
young man who had not a single guinea he could
call his own. This gave him great offence; but
remembering his sole dependence for subsistence
was in the power of Mr. Payne, he concealed his
resentment; yet could not refrain from speaking
freely behind his back, and saying &lsquo;he thought
him a d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d dull fellow;&rsquo; though, indeed, this
was an epithet he was pleased to bestow on every
one who did not think as he would have them.
His frequent demands for a supply obliged Mr.
Payne to tell him he must pursue some other
line of life, for he was sure Colonel Martyn would
be displeased with him for having done so much.
This resource being stopped, forced him to set
about some work, of which his &lsquo;History of the
Revival of Learning&rsquo; was the first; and for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxiv' name='page_xxiv'></a>xxiv</span>
which he printed proposals (one of which I have),
and took the first subscription money from many
of his particular friends: the work was begun,
but soon stood still. Both Dr. Johnson and
Mr. Langhorne are mistaken when they say, the
&lsquo;Translation of Aristotle&rsquo; was never begun: I
know the contrary, for some progress was made
in both, but most in the latter. From the freedom
subsisting between us, we took the liberty of
saying any thing to each other. I one day reproached
him with idleness; when, to convince
me my censure was unjust, he showed me many
sheets of his &lsquo;Translation of Aristotle,&rsquo; which he
said he had so fully employed himself about, as
to prevent him calling on many of his friends so
frequently as he used to do. Soon after this he
engaged with Mr. Manby, a bookseller on Ludgate
Hill, to furnish him with some Lives for
the Biographia Britannica, which Manby was
then publishing. He showed me some of the
lives in embryo; but I do not recollect that any
of them came to perfection. To raise a present
subsistence he set about writing his odes; and,
having a general invitation to my house, he frequently
passed whole days there, which he employed
in writing them, and as frequently burning
what he had written, after reading them to me:
many of them, which pleased me, I struggled to
preserve, but without effect; for, pretending he
would alter them, he got them from me, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxv' name='page_xxv'></a>xxv</span>
thrust them into the fire. He was an acceptable
companion every where; and, among the gentlemen
who loved him for a genius, I may reckon
the Doctors Armstrong, Barrowby, and Hill,
Messrs. Quin, Garrick, and Foote, who frequently
took his opinion on their pieces before they were
seen by the public. He was particularly noticed
by the geniuses who frequented the Bedford and
Slaughter&rsquo;s Coffee Houses. From his knowledge
of Garrick he had the liberty of the scenes and
green-room, where he made diverting observations
on the vanity and false consequence of that
class of people; and his manner of relating them
to his particular friends was extremely entertaining.
In this manner he lived, with and upon
his friends, until the death of Colonel Martyn,
who left what fortune he died possessed of unto
him and his two sisters. I fear I cannot be certain
as to dates, but believe he left the university
in the year 43. Some circumstances I
recollect, make me almost certain he was in
London that year; but I will not be so certain
of the time he died, which I did not hear of till
long after it happened. When his health and
faculties began to decline, he went to France,
and after to Bath, in hope his health might be
restored, but without success. I never saw him
after his sister removed him from M&rsquo;Donald&rsquo;s
madhouse at Chelsea to Chichester, where he
soon sunk into a deplorable state of idiotism,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxvi' name='page_xxvi'></a>xxvi</span>
which, when I was told, shocked me exceedingly;
and, even now, the remembrance of a
man for whom I had a particular friendship, and
in whose company I have passed so many pleasant
happy hours, gives me a severe shock.
Since it is in consequence of your own request,
Sir, that I write this long farrago, I expect you
will overlook all inaccuracies. I am, Sir,</p>

<p class='smaller'>&ldquo;Mr. William Hymers, Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following communication, by Thomas Warton,
was also found among the papers of Mr.
Hymers. A few passages, concerning various
readings, are omitted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I often saw Collins in London in 1750.
This was before his illness. He then told me
of his intended History of the Revival of
Learning, and proposed a scheme of a review,
to be called the Clarendon Review, and to be
printed at the university press, under the conduct
and authority of the university. About Easter,
the next year, I was in London; when, being
given over, and supposed to be dying, he desired
to see me, that he might take his last leave of
me; but he grew better; and in the summer he
sent me a letter on some private business, which
I have now by me, dated Chichester, June 9,
1751, written in a fine hand, and without the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxvii' name='page_xxvii'></a>xxvii</span>
least symptom of a disordered or debilitated understanding.
In 1754, he came to Oxford for
change of air and amusement, where he stayed a
month; I saw him frequently, but he was so
weak and low, that he could not bear conversation.
Once he walked from his lodgings, opposite
Christ Church, to Trinity College, but
supported by his servant. The same year, in
September, I and my brother visited him at Chichester,
where he lived, in the cathedral cloisters,
with his sister. The first day he was in high
spirits at intervals, but exerted himself so much
that he could not see us the second. Here he
showed us an Ode to Mr. John Home, on his
leaving England for Scotland, in the octave stanza,
very long, and beginning,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Home, thou return&rsquo;st from Thames.</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>I remember there was a beautiful description of
the spectre of a man drowned in the night, or, in
the language of the old Scotch superstitions,
seized by the angry spirit of the waters, appearing
to his wife with pale blue cheek, &amp;c. Mr.
Home has no copy of it. He also showed us
another ode, of two or three four-lined stanzas,
called the Bell of Arragon; on a tradition that,
anciently, just before the king of Spain died, the
great bell of the cathedral of Sarragossa, in Arragon,
tolled spontaneously. It began thus:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxviii' name='page_xxviii'></a>xxviii</span></div>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>The bell of Arragon, they say,</p>
<p>Spontaneous speaks the fatal day.</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Soon afterwards were these lines:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Whatever dark aerial power,</p>
<p>Commission&rsquo;d, haunts the gloomy tower.</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The last stanza consisted of a moral transition to
his own death and knell, which he called &lsquo;some
simpler bell.&rsquo; I have seen all his odes already
published in his own handwriting; they had the
marks of repeated correction: he was perpetually
changing his epithets. Dr. Warton, my brother,
has a few fragments of some other odes, but
too loose and imperfect for publication, yet containing
traces of high imagery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In illustration of what Dr. Johnson has related,
that during his last malady he was a great
reader of the Bible, I am favoured with the following
anecdote from the Reverend Mr. Shenton,
Vicar of St. Andrews, at Chichester, by whom
Collins was buried: &lsquo;Walking in my vicaral garden
one Sunday evening, during Collins&rsquo;s last
illness, I heard a female (the servant, I suppose)
reading the Bible in his chamber. Mr. Collins
had been accustomed to rave much, and make
great moanings; but while she was reading, or
rather attempting to read, he was not only silent
but attentive likewise, correcting her mistakes,
which indeed were very frequent, through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxix' name='page_xxix'></a>xxix</span>
whole of the twenty-seventh chapter of Genesis.&rsquo;
I have just been informed, from undoubted authority,
that Collins had finished a Preliminary
Dissertation to be prefixed to his History of the
Restoration of Learning, and that it was written
with great judgment, precision, and knowledge of
the subject.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;T. W.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The overthrow of Collins&rsquo;s mind was too complete
for it to be restored by variety of scene or
the attentions of friendship. Thomas Warton
describes him as being in a weak and low condition,
and unable to bear conversation, when he
saw him at Oxford. He was afterwards confined
in a house for the insane at Chelsea; but before
September, 1754, he was removed to Chichester,
under the care of his sister, where he was
visited by the two Wartons. At this time his
spirits temporarily rallied; and he adverted with
delight to literature, showing his guest the Ode
to Mr. Home on his leaving England for Scotland.
During Collins&rsquo;s illness Johnson was a frequent
inquirer after his health, and those inquiries were
made with a degree of feeling which, as he himself
hints, may have partly arisen from the dread
he entertained lest he might be the victim of a
similar calamity. The following extracts are
from letters addressed to Joseph Warton:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxx' name='page_xxx'></a>xxx</span></div>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;March 8, 1754.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how little can we venture to exult in any
intellectual powers or literary attainments, when
we consider the condition of poor Collins. I
knew him a few years ago, full of hopes and full
of projects, versed in many languages, high in
fancy, and strong in retention. This busy and
forcible mind is now under the government of
those who lately would not have been able to
comprehend the least and most narrow of its designs.
What do you hear of him? are there
hopes of his recovery? or is he to pass the
remainder of his life in misery and degradation?
perhaps with complete consciousness of his calamity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;December 24, 1754.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear Collins! Let me know whether
you think it would give him pleasure if I should
write to him. I have often been near his state,
and therefore have it in great commiseration.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;April 15, 1756.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What becomes of poor dear Collins? I wrote
him a letter which he never answered. I suppose
writing is very troublesome to him. That man is
no common loss. The moralists all talk of the
uncertainty of fortune, and the transitoriness of
beauty; but it is yet more dreadful to consider
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxi' name='page_xxxi'></a>xxxi</span>
that the powers of the mind are equally liable to
change, that understanding may make its appearance
and depart, that it may blaze and
expire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this state of mental darkness did Collins
pass the last six or seven years of his existence,
in the house now occupied by Mr. Mason, a
bookseller in Chichester. His malady is described
by Johnson as being, not so much an alienation
of mind as a general laxity and feebleness of his
vital, rather than his intellectual, powers; but his
disorder seems, from other authorities, to have
been of a more violent nature. As he was never
married, he was indebted for protection and
kindness to his youngest sister; and death, the
only hope of the afflicted, came to his relief on
the 12th of June, 1759, in the thirty-ninth year
of his age, a period of life when the fervour of
imagination is generally chastened without being
subdued, and when all the mental powers are in
their fullest vigour. He was buried in the church
of St. Andrew, at Chichester, on the 15th of
June; and the admiration of the public for his
genius has been manifested by the erection of a
monument by Flaxman, to his memory, in the
Cathedral, which is thus described by Mr. Dallaway,
the historian of Sussex:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collins is represented as sitting in a reclining
posture, during a lucid interval of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxii' name='page_xxxii'></a>xxxii</span>
afflicting malady to which he was subject, with a
calm and benign aspect, as if seeking refuge
from his misfortunes in the consolations of the
gospel, which appears open on a table before
him, whilst his lyre and one of his best compositions
lie neglected on the ground. Upon
the pediment of the table are placed two female
ideal figures in relief, representing love and pity,
entwined each in the arms of the other; the proper
emblems of the genius of his poetry.&rdquo; It
bears the following epitaph from the pen of
Hayley:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Ye who the merits of the dead revere,</p>
<p>Who hold misfortune&rsquo;s sacred genius dear,</p>
<p>Regard this tomb, where Collins, hapless name,</p>
<p>Solicits kindness with a double claim.</p>
<p>Though nature gave him, and though science taught</p>
<p>The fire of fancy, and the reach of thought,</p>
<p>Severely doom&rsquo;d to penury&rsquo;s extreme,</p>
<p>He pass&rsquo;d in maddening pain life&rsquo;s feverish dream,</p>
<p>While rays of genius only served to show</p>
<p>The thickening horror, and exalt his woe.</p>
<p>Ye walls that echo&rsquo;d to his frantic moan,</p>
<p>Guard the due records of this grateful stone;</p>
<p>Strangers to him, enamour&rsquo;d of his lays,</p>

<p>For this the ashes of a bard require,</p>
<p>Who touch&rsquo;d the tenderest notes of pity&rsquo;s lyre;</p>
<p>Who join&rsquo;d pure faith to strong poetic powers;</p>
<p>Who, in reviving reason&rsquo;s lucid hours,</p>
<p>Sought on one book his troubled mind to rest,</p>
<p>And rightly deem&rsquo;d the book of God the best.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Collins&rsquo;s character has been portrayed by all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxiii' name='page_xxxiii'></a>xxxiii</span>
his biographers in very agreeable colours. He
was amiable and virtuous, and was as much
courted for his popular manners as for the charms
of his conversation. The associate of Johnson,
Armstrong, Hill, Garrick, Quin, Foote, the two
Wartons, and Thomson, and the friend of several
of these eminent men, he must have possessed
many of the qualities by which they were distinguished;
for though an adviser may be chosen
from a very different class of persons, genius will
only herd with genius. Johnson has honoured
him by saying, that &ldquo;his morals were pure and
his opinions pious;&rdquo; and though he hints that
his habits were sometimes at variance with these
characteristics, he assigns the aberration to the
temptations of want, and the society into which
poverty sometimes drives the best disposed persons,
adding, that he &ldquo;preserved the sources
of action unpolluted, that his principles were
never shaken, that his distinctions of right and
wrong were never confounded, and that his faults
had nothing of malignity or design, but proceeded
from some unexpected pressure or casual
temptation.&rdquo; A higher eulogium, from so rigid
a moralist, could not be pronounced on a man
whose life was, for many years, unsettled and
perplexed; and those only who have experienced
the pressure of pecuniary necessities can be aware
of the difficulty of resisting meanness, or avoiding
vice, if not in the sense in which these terms are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxiv' name='page_xxxiv'></a>xxxiv</span>
usually understood, at least in a sense to which
they may as properly be applied&ndash;&ndash;that of refusing
to prostitute talents to purposes foreign to the
conviction and taste of their possessor.</p>
<p>On this mainly depend the annoyances and
dangers of him who seeks a subsistence from his
pen. The opinions which he may be desirous to
express, or the subject he may be capable of
illustrating, may not be popular, and the more
important or learned they be, the more likely is
such to be the case. Of course his labours would
be rejected by publishers, who cannot buy what
will not sell; hence no alternative remains but for
him to manufacture marketable commodities; and
when the <i>popular</i> taste of the present, as well as
of former times, is remembered, the degradation
to which a man of high intellect must often submit,
when he neglects that for which nature and
study peculiarly qualified him, for what is in
general demand, may be easily conceived. It is
not requisite to advert to the taste of the age
in which we live, farther than to allude to the
class of works which issues from the bazaars of
<i>fashionable</i> publishers, and to ask, when such
are alone in request, what would have been the
fate, had they lived in our own times, of Johnson,
Pope, Dryden, Addison, and the other ornaments
of the golden age of literature? But if even in
that age the Odes of Collins were too abstracted
from mundane feelings, too rich in imagery, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxv' name='page_xxxv'></a>xxxv</span>
too strongly marked by the fervour of inspiration
to be generally appreciated, his chance of being
so, by the public generally, is at this moment
less; and the only hope of his obtaining that
popularity to which he is unquestionably entitled,
is by placing his works within the reach of all,
and, more especially, by acquainting the multitude
with the opinion entertained of him, by those
whose judgments they have the sense to venerate,
since they are sometimes willing to receive, on the
credit of another, that which they have not themselves
the discrimination or feeling to perceive.</p>
<p>An anecdote is related of Collins which, if true,
proves that he felt the neglect with which his
Odes were treated with the indignation natural
to an enthusiastic temper. Having purchased
the unsold copies of the first edition from the
booksellers, he set fire to them with his own
hand, as if to revenge himself on the apathy and
ignorance of the public.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to append to the Memoir of
Collins many observations on the character of his
poetry, because its peculiar beauties, and the
qualities by which it is distinguished, are described
with considerable force and eloquence by
Sir Egerton Brydges, in the Essay prefixed to
this edition. Campbell&rsquo;s remarks on the same
subject cannot be forgotten; and other critics of
the highest reputation have concurred in ascribing
to Collins a conception and genius scarcely exceeded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxvi' name='page_xxxvi'></a>xxxvi</span>
by any English poet. To say that Sir
Egerton Brydges&rsquo;s Essay exaggerates the merit
of some of his productions may produce the retort
which has been made to Johnson&rsquo;s criticism, that
he was too deficient in feeling to be capable of
appreciating the excellence of the pieces which
he censures. It is not, however, inconsistent
with a high respect for Collins, to ascribe every
possible praise to that unrivaled production, the
Ode to the Passions, to feel deeply the beauty,
the pathos, and the sublime conceptions of the
Odes to Evening, to Pity, to Simplicity, and a
few others, and yet to be sensible of the occasional
obscurity and imperfections of his imagery
in other pieces, to find it difficult to discover the
meaning of some passages, to think the opening
of four of his odes which commence with the
common-place invocation of &ldquo;O thou,&rdquo; and the
alliteration by which so many lines are disfigured,
blemishes too serious to be forgotten, unless the
judgment be drowned in the full tide of generous
and enthusiastic admiration of the great and extraordinary
beauties by which these faults are
more than redeemed.</p>
<p>That these defects are to be ascribed to haste
it would be uncandid to deny; but haste is no
apology for such faults in productions which
scarcely fill a hundred pages, and which their
author had ample opportunities to remove.</p>
<p>It may also be thought heterodoxy by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxvii' name='page_xxxvii'></a>xxxvii</span>
band, which, if small in numbers, is distinguished
by taste, feeling, and genius, to concur in Collins&rsquo;s
opinion, when he expressed himself dissatisfied
with his Eclogues; for, though they are not without
merit, it is very doubtful if they would have lived,
even till this time, but for the Odes with which
they are published, notwithstanding the zeal of
Dr. Langhorne, who is in raptures over passages
the excellence of which is not very conspicuous.
To give a preference to the Verses to Sir Thomas
Hanmer, of which all that Langhorne could find
to say is, &ldquo;that the versification is easy and
genteel, and the allusions always poetical,&rdquo; and
especially to the Ode addressed to Mr. Home,
on the superstition of the Highlands, over the
Eclogues, may possibly be deemed to betray a
corrupt taste, since it is an admission which is, it
is believed, made for the first time. In that Ode,
among a hundred other beautiful verses, the following
address to Tasso has seldom been surpassed:</p>

<p>Hence, his warm lay with softest sweetness flows!</p>

give to that Ode claims to admiration which, if
admitted, have been hitherto conceded in silence.</p>
<p>From the coincidence between Collins&rsquo;s love of,
and addresses to, Music, his residence at Oxford,
and from internal evidence, Some Verses on Our
Late Taste in Music, which appeared in the Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine for 1740, and there said to
be &ldquo;by a Gentleman of Oxford,&rdquo; are printed in
this edition of Collins&rsquo;s works, not, however, as
positively his, but as being so likely to be written
by him, as to justify their being brought to the
notice of his readers.</p>
<p>A poet, and not to have felt the tender passion,
would be a creature which the world has never
yet seen. It is said that Collins was extremely
fond of a young lady who was born the day
before him, and who did not return his affection;
and that, punning upon his misfortune, he observed,
&ldquo;he came into the world a day after the
fair.&rdquo; The lady is supposed to have been Miss
Elizabeth Goddard, the intended bride of Colonel
Ross, to whom he addressed his beautiful Ode on
the death of that Officer at the battle of Fontenoy,
at which time she was on a visit to the family of
the Earl of Tankerville, who then resided at Up-Park,
near Chichester, a place that overlooks the
little village of Harting, mentioned in the Ode.</p>
<p>Collins&rsquo;s person was of the middle size and
well formed; of a light complexion, with gray,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxxix' name='page_xxxix'></a>xxxix</span>
weak eyes. His mind was deeply imbued with
classical literature, and he understood the Italian,
French, and Spanish languages. He was well
read, and was particularly conversant with early
English writers, and to an ardent love of literature
he united, as is manifest from many of his
pieces, a passionate devotion to Music, that</p>

Elizabeth, the eldest, died unmarried, and Anne,
the youngest, who took care of him when he was
bereft of reason, married first Mr. Hugh Sempill,
who died in 1762, and secondly the Rev.
Dr. Thomas Durnford, and died at Chichester in
November, 1789. Her character is thus described
on the authority of Mr. Park: &ldquo;The Reverend
Mr. Durnford, who resided at Chichester, and
was the son of Dr. Durnford, informed me, in
August, 1795, that the sister of Collins loved
money to excess, and evinced so outrageous an
aversion to her brother, because he squandered
or gave away to the boys in the cloisters whatever
money he had, that she destroyed, in a
paroxysm of resentment, all his papers, and
whatever remained of his enthusiasm for poetry,
as far as she could. Mr. Hayley told me, when
I visited him at Eartham, that he had obtained
from her a small drawing by Collins, but it possessed
no other value than as a memorial that
the bard had attempted to handle the pencil as
well as the pen.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> That Mrs. Durnford was indifferent

expression of acknowledgment to the Bishop of
Hereford, to the President of Magdalen College,
to H. Gabell, Esq., and to I. Sanden, Esq., of
Chichester, for the desire which they were so
good as to manifest that this account of Collins
might be more satisfactory than it is; and if his
admirers consider that his present biographer has
not done sufficient justice to his memory, an antidote
to the injury will be found in the fervent
and unqualified admiration which Sir Egerton
Brydges has evinced for his genius.</p>

<h2>AN ESSAY ON THE GENIUS AND POEMS OF COLLINS.</h2>
<h3>  BY SIR EGERTON BRYDGES,<br />  BART.</h3>
</div>
<p>Collins is the founder of a new school of poetry,
of a high class. It is true that, unless Buckhurst
and Spenser had gone before him, he could not
have written as he has done; yet he is an inventor
very distinct from both. He calls his odes descriptive
and allegorical; and this characterises
them truly, but too generally. The personification
of abstract qualities had never been so happily
executed before; the pure spirituality of the conception,
the elegance and force of the language,
the harmony and variety of the numbers, were
all executed with a felicity which none before or
since have reached. That these poems did not
at once captivate the public attention cannot be
accounted for by any cause hitherto assigned.
We may not wonder that the multitude did not
at once perceive their full beauties; but that,
among readers of taste and learning, there should
not have been found a sufficient number to set
the example of admiration, is very extraordinary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xliv' name='page_xliv'></a>xliv</span>
In addition to all their other high merits, the
mere novelty of thought and manner were sufficient
to excite immediate notice. Nor was
there any thing in Collins&rsquo;s station or character
to create prejudices against the probability that
beautiful effusions of genius might be struck out
by his hand. His education at the college of
Winchester, his fame at Oxford, his associates in
London, all were fair preludes to the production
of beautiful poetry. Indeed, he had already
produced beautiful poetry in his Oriental Eclogues,
four years before his Odes appeared.
These were, it is admitted, of a different cast
from his Odes, and of a gentleness and chastity
of thought and diction, which he himself was
conscious, some years afterwards, did not very
well represent the gorgeousness of eastern composition.</p>
<p>It was a crisis when there was a fair opening
for new candidates for the laurel. The uniformity
of Pope&rsquo;s style began already to pall upon
the public ear. Thomson was indolent, and
Young eccentric; Gray had not yet appeared on
the stage; and Akenside&rsquo;s metaphysical subject
and diffuse style were not calculated to engross
the general taste. Johnson had taken possession
of the field of satire, but there are too many
readers of enthusiastic mind to be satisfied with
satire. The pedantry and uncouthness of Walter
Harte had precluded him from ever being a favourite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xlv' name='page_xlv'></a>xlv</span>
with the public; Shenstone had not yet
risen into fame; and Lyttelton was engrossed by
politics. When, therefore, Collins&rsquo;s Odes appeared,
all speculation would have anticipated
that they must have been successful. But we
must recollect that they did not excite the admiration
of Johnson; and that Gray did not read
them with that unqualified approval which his
native taste would have inspired. This singularity
must be accounted for by other causes
than their want of merit.</p>
<p>The disappointment of Collins was so keen and
deep, that he not only burned the unsold copies
with his own hand, but soon fell into a melancholy
which ended in insanity. Many persons
have affected to comment on this result with an
unfeeling ignorance of human nature, and, more
especially, of fervid genius. It is, undoubtedly,
highly dangerous to give the entire reins to imagination;
the discipline of a constant exercise
of reason is not only salutary, but necessary.
But one can easily conceive how the indulgence
of that state of mind which produced Collins&rsquo;s
Odes could end in an entire overthrow of the
intellect, when embittered by a defect of the
principal objects of his worldly ambition. He is
said to have been puffed up by a vanity which
prompted him to expect that all eyes would be
upon him, and all voices lifted in his praise.
Such was the conception of a vulgar observer of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xlvi' name='page_xlvi'></a>xlvi</span>
the human character. Why should it have been
vanity that prompted this hope? It was a consciousness
of merit, of those brilliant powers which
produced the Ode to the Passions! was ever a
voice content which sung to those who would not
hear, which was condemned</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;To waste its sweetness on the desert air?&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Spenser&rsquo;s power of personification is copious
beyond example; but it is seldom sufficiently
select; rich as it is in imagination, it too commonly
wants taste and delicacy; it has the fault
of coarseness, which Burke&rsquo;s images in prose two
centuries afterwards, sometimes fell into. But
Collins&rsquo;s images are as pure, and of as exquisite
delicacy, as they are spiritual. They are not
human beings invested with some of the attributes
of angels, but the whole figure is purely angelic,
and of a higher order of creation; in this they
are distinct even from the admirable personifications
of Gray, because they are less earthly. The
Ode to the Passions is, by universal consent,
the noblest of Collins&rsquo;s productions, because it
exhibits a much more extended invention, not of
one passion only, but of all the passions combined,
acting, according to the powers of each,
to one end. The execution, also, is the happiest,
each particular passion is drawn with inimitable
force and compression. Let us take only <span class='smcap'>Fear</span>
and <span class='smcap'>Despair</span>, each dashed out in four lines,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xlvii' name='page_xlvii'></a>xlvii</span>
of which every word is like inspiration. Beautiful
as Spenser is, and sometimes sublime, yet
he redoubles his touches too much, and often
introduces some coarse feature or expression,
which destroys the spell. Spenser, indeed, has
other merits of splendid and inexhaustible invention,
which render it impossible to put Collins on
a par with him: but we must not estimate merit
by mere quantity: if a poet produces but one
short piece, which is perfect, he must be placed
according to its quality. And surely there is not
a single figure in Collins&rsquo;s Ode to the Passions
which is not perfect, both in conception and
language. He has had many imitators, but no
one has ever approached him in his own department.</p>
<p>The Ode to Evening is, perhaps, the next in
point of merit. It is quite of a different cast; it
is descriptive of natural scenery; and such a
scene of enchanting repose was never exhibited
by Claude, or any other among the happiest of
painters. Though a mere verbal description can
never rival a fine picture in a mere address to the
material part of our nature, yet it far eclipses it
with those who have the endowment of a brilliant
fancy, because it gratifies their taste, selection,
and sentiment. Delightful, therefore, as it is to
look upon a Claude, it is more delightful to look
upon this description. It is vain to attempt to
analyse the charm of this Ode; it is so subtle,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xlviii' name='page_xlviii'></a>xlviii</span>
that it escapes analysis. Its harmony is so perfect,
that it requires no rhyme: the objects are
so happily chosen, and the simple epithets convey
ideas and feelings so congenial to each other, as to
throw the reader into the very mood over which
the personified being so beautifully designed presides.
No other poem on the same subject has
the same magic. It assuredly suggested some
images and a tone of expression to Gray in his
Elegy.</p>
<p>The Ode on the Poetical Character is here and
there a little involved and obscure; but its general
conception is magnificent, and beaming
that spirit of inventive enthusiasm, which alone
can cherish the poet&rsquo;s powers, and bring forth
the due fruits. Collins never touched the lyre
but he was borne away by the inspiration under
which he laboured. The Dirge in Cymbeline,
the lines on Thomson, and the Ode on Colonel
Ross breathe such a beautiful simplicity of pathos,
and yet are so highly poetical and graceful in
every thought and tone, that, exquisitely polished
as they are, and without one superfluous or one
prosaic word, they never once betray the artifices
of composition. The extreme transparency of
the words and thoughts would induce a vulgar
reader to consider them trite, while they are the
expression of a genius so refined as to be all essence
of spirit. In Gray, excellent as he is, we
continually encounter the marks of labour and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xlix' name='page_xlix'></a>xlix</span>
effort, and occasional crudeness, which shows
that effort had not always succeeded, such as
&ldquo;iron hand and torturing hour;&rdquo; but nothing of
this kind occurs in the principal poems of Collins.
There is a fire of mind which supersedes labour,
and produces what labour cannot. It has been
said that Collins is neither sublime nor pathetic;
but only ingenious and fanciful. The truth is,
that he was cast in the very mould of sublimity
and pathos. He lived in an atmosphere above
the earth, and breathed only in a visionary world.
He was conversant with nothing else, and this
must have been the secret by which he produced
compositions so entirely spiritual. He who has
daily intercourse with the world, and feels the
vulgar human passions, cannot be in a humour
to write poems which do not partake of earthly
coarseness.</p>
<p>It may be asked, <i>cui bono?</i> what is the moral
use of such poems as these? Whatever refines the
intellect improves the heart; whatever augments
and fortifies the spiritual part of our nature raises
us in the rank of created beings. And what
poems are more calculated to refine our intellect,
and increase our spirituality, than the poems of
Collins? To embody, in a brilliant manner, the
most beautiful abstractions, to put them into
action, and to add to them splendour, harmony,
strength, and purity of language, is to complete
a task as admirable for its use and its delight, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_l' name='page_l'></a>l</span>
it is difficult to be executed. No one can receive
the intellectual gratification which such works
are capable of producing without being the better
for it. The understanding was never yet roused
to the conception of such pure and abstract
thinking without an elevation of the whole nature
of the being so roused. The expression of subtle
and evanescent ideas, carried to its perfection, is
among the very noblest and most exalted studies
with which the human mind can be conversant.</p>
<p>It has been the fashion of our own age to beat
out works into twentyfold and fiftyfold the size
of those of Collins. I do not quarrel with that
fashion; each fashion has its use: and my own
taste induces me to perceive the value and many
attractions of long narrative poems, full of human
passions and practical wisdom. The matter is
more desirable than the workmanship; and much
of occasional carelessness in the language may
be forgiven, for fertility of natural and just
thought and interest of story. But this in no
degree diminishes the value of those gems, which,
though of the smallest size, comprehend perfections
of every kind. It is easier to work upon a
large field than a small one,&ndash;&ndash;one where is</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Ample room and verge enough</p>
<p>The characters of hell to trace.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>But these diffuse productions are not calculated
to give the same sort of pleasure as the gems.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_li' name='page_li'></a>li</span>
How difficult was the path chosen by Collins is
sufficiently proved by the want of success of all
who have entered the same walk: Gray&rsquo;s was
not the same, as I shall endeavour presently to
show. In the miscellany of Dodsley and other
collectors will be found numerous attempts at
Allegorical Odes: they are almost all nauseous
failures&ndash;&ndash;without originality or distinctness of
conception; bald in their language, lame in their
numbers, and repulsive from their insipidity of
ideas.</p>
<p>Gray&rsquo;s personifications can scarcely be called
allegorical, they have so much of humanity about
them. He dealt in all the noble and melancholy
feelings of the human heart: he never for
one moment forgot to be a moralist: he was
constantly under the influence of powerful sympathy
for the miseries of man&rsquo;s life; and wrote
from the overflow of his bosom rather than of his
imagination. It is true that his imagination presented
the pictures to him; but it was his heart
which impelled him to speak. Take the Ode on
the Prospect of Eton College; there is not one
word which did not break from the bottom of
his heart. The multitude cannot enter into the
visionary world of Collins: all who have a spark
of virtuous human feelings can sympathize with
Gray. It is impossible to deny that of these two
beautiful poets Gray is the most instructive as a
moralist; but Gray is not so original as Collins,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lii' name='page_lii'></a>lii</span>
not so inventive, not so perfect in his language,
and has not so much the fire and flow of inspiration.</p>
<p>When Collins is spoken of as one of the <i>minor</i>
poets, it is a sad misapplication of the term.
Unless he be minor because the number and size
of his poems is small, no one is less a minor
poet. In him every word is poetry, and poetry
either sublime or pathetic. He does not rise to
the sublimity of Milton or Dante, or reach the
graceful tenderness of Petrarch; but he has a
visionary invention of his own, to which there is
no rival. As long as the language lasts, every
richly gifted and richly cultivated mind will read
him with intense and wondering rapture; and
will not cease to entertain the conviction, from
his example, if from no other, that true poetry of
the higher orders is real inspiration.</p>
<p>It will occur to many readers, on perusing these
passages of exalted praise, that Johnson has
spoken of Collins in a very different manner.
Almost fifty years have elapsed since Johnson&rsquo;s
final criticism on him appeared in his Lives of
the Poets. It disgusted me so much at the time,
and the disgust continued so violent, that for a
long period it blinded me to all his stupendous
merits, because it evinced not only bad taste
but unamiable feelings. I cannot yet either
justify it, or account for it. He speaks of Collins
having sought for splendour without attaining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_liii' name='page_liii'></a>liii</span>
it&ndash;&ndash;of clogging his lines with consonants, and of
mistaking inversion of language for poetry. Not
one of these faults belongs to Collins. In almost
all his poems the words follow their natural order,
and are mellifluous beyond those of almost any
other verse writer. If the Passions are not described
with splendour, there is no such thing as
splendour. If the beauties which he sought and
attained are unnatural and extravagant, then the
tests of correctness and good taste which have
been hitherto set up must be abandoned.</p>
<p>This severe criticism is the more extraordinary
because Johnson professed a warm personal
friendship for Collins; he professes admiration
of his talents, learning, and taste, as well as
of his disposition and heart, and speaks of his
afflicting ill health with a passionate tenderness
which has seldom been equalled in beauty, pathos,
and force of language. That he could love
him personally with such fondness, but be blind
to his splendid and unrivaled genius, is utterly
beyond my power to account for. Who can say
that Johnson wanted taste when we read his
sublime and acute criticisms on Milton, Dryden,
and Pope? Was it that he roused all the faculties
of his judgment when he spoke of these
great men of past times; yet, that when he
descended to his contemporaries, he indulged his
feelings rather than his intellect, and suffered
himself to be overcome by the evil passions of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_liv' name='page_liv'></a>liv</span>
envy and contempt? His natural taste was, probably,
not the best; when his criticisms were
perfect he had tasked his intellect rather than his
feelings. He was a man of general wisdom and
undoubted genius, but not a very nice scholar,
and he prided himself upon his every-day sense,
his practical knowledge, rather than those visionary
musings which he thought a dangerous indulgence
of imagination. He could not put the
compositions of Collins among the mere curiosities
of literature, but he permitted himself to
depreciate habits of mental excursion which he
had not himself cultivated.</p>
<p>It was not till more than twenty years after
Collins&rsquo;s death that his Ode on the Superstitions
of the Highlands was recovered. The two Wartons
had seen it, and spoke highly of it to Johnson
and others. About 1781, or 1782, a copy
was found among the papers of Dr. Carlysle,
with a chasm of two or three stanzas. The public
deemed it equal to the expectations which had
been raised of it; for my part I will confess
that I was always deeply disappointed at it.
There are in it occasional traces of Collins&rsquo;s genius
and several good lines&ndash;&ndash;but none grand&ndash;&ndash;none
of that felicitous flow and inspired vigour
which mark the Ode to the Passions and other
of his lyrics&ndash;&ndash;none of that happy personification
of abstract conceptions which is the characteristic
of his genius. The majority of the lines lag and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lv' name='page_lv'></a>lv</span>
move heavily, and do not seem to me to rise
much above mediocrity in the expression. The
subject was attractive, and might have afforded
space for the wild excursions of Collins&rsquo;s creative
powers. As to the edition of Bell, in which it is
pretended that the lost stanzas have been recovered,
I have no more doubt that they are <i>spurious</i>
than that I did not write them myself: I
will not dwell upon this subject, but only mention
that it is quite impossible Collins could write
&ldquo;<i>Fate</i> gave the <i>fatal</i> blow,&rdquo; and &ldquo;bowing to
Freedom&rsquo;s <i>yoke</i>;&rdquo; and such a line as</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;In the first year of the first George&rsquo;s reign,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>There is not one line among these interpolated
stanzas which it is possible that Collins could
have written.</p>
<p>Mr. Ragdale relates that Collins was in the
habit of writing numerous fragments, and then
throwing them into the flames. Jackson, of
Exeter, says the same of John Bampfylde. A
sensitive mind is scarce ever satisfied with the
reception it meets, when, in first heat of composition,
it hopes to delight some listener, to which
it first communicates its new effusions. It almost
always considers itself to be &ldquo;damn&rsquo;d by
faint praise.&rdquo; I have known fervid authors who,
if they read or communicated a piece before it
was finished, never went on with it. They
thought it became blown upon, and turned from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lvi' name='page_lvi'></a>lvi</span>
it with coldness, disgust, and despair. Yet the
hearer is commonly not in fault: who can satisfy
the warm hopes of aspiring and restless genius?</p>
<p>The Wartons have expressed themselves with
praise and affection of Collins, but not, I think,
with the entire admiration which was due to him.
Joseph Warton was a good-natured and generous-minded
man, but something of rivalry lurked in
his bosom; and the fraternal partiality of Thomas
Warton had the same effect. The younger brother
seems to have thought that Joseph&rsquo;s genius was
equal to that of Collins. Gray had the critical
acumen to discern the difference; but still he in
no degree does justice to Collins. He accuses
him of want of taste and selection, which is a
surprising charge; and the more so, because Gray
did not disdain to borrow from him. Gray&rsquo;s
fault was an affected fastidiousness, as appears
by the slighting manner in which he speaks of
Thomson&rsquo;s Castle of Indolence on its first appearance,
as well as of Akenside&rsquo;s Pleasures of
Imagination, and Shenstone&rsquo;s Elegies. That
Gray had exquisite taste, and was a perfect
scholar, no one can doubt.</p>
<p>Collins lived thirteen years after the publication
of his Odes. It does not appear that he produced
any thing after this publication. How
soon his grand mental malady extinguished his
literary powers, I do not exactly know, nor is
it recorded, whether any part of it arose from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lvii' name='page_lvii'></a>lvii</span>
bodily disorders. Medical men have never agreed
regarding this most deplorable of human afflictions.
In Collins&rsquo;s case it probably arose from
the mind. On such an intellectual temperament
the extinction of the visions which Hope had
painted to him seems to have been sufficient to
produce that derangement, which first enfeebled,
and then perverted and annihilated his faculties.
The account given by Johnson is different from
that supplied by Mr. Ragdale and another anonymous
communication.</p>
<p>He had, perhaps, lucid intervals in which he
discovered nothing but weakness and exhaustion.
But he appears to have sometimes had fits of
violence and despair. It seems that he was an
enthusiastic admirer of Shakespeare, and a great
reader of black letter books. It may be inferred
that his studies were not entirely given up during
his malady; but it is a subject of great wonder
and regret that the Wartons, the intimate friends
both of his better and darker days, have left no
particular memorials of him. He had a sister,
lately, if not still, living, from whom, though
of a very uncongenial nature, something might
surely have been gathered. But there is a familiarity
which, by destroying admiration, destroys
the perception of what will interest others. There
are few of our poets of rare genius, of whose
private life and character much is known. Little
is known of Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lviii' name='page_lviii'></a>lviii</span>
not much even of Thomson. More is known of
Gray by the medium of his beautiful letters;
but when Southey, Wordsworth, and Scott are
gone, posterity will know every particular of
them; and, even now, know much which fills
them with delight and admiration. But let us
know something in good time, also of the new
candidates for poetical fame!</p>
<p>If the life of a poet is not in accordance with
his song, it may be suspected that the song itself
is not genuine. Who can be a poet, and yet be
a worldling in his passions and habits? An artificial
poet is a disgusting dealer in trifles: nothing
but the predominance of strong and unstimulated
feeling will give that inspiration without
which it is worse than an empty sound. When
the passion is factitious, the excitement has always
an immoral tendency; but the delineation
of real and amiable sentiments calls up a sympathy
in other bosoms which thus confirms and
fixes them where they would otherwise die away.
The memory may preserve what is artificial, but,
when it becomes stale, it turns to offensiveness,
and thus breeds an alienation from literature
itself.</p>
<p>That Collins has continued to increase in fame
as years have passed away, is the most decisive
of all proofs that his poems have the pure and
sterling merit which began to be ascribed to them
soon after his death. M. Bonstetten tells me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lix' name='page_lix'></a>lix</span>
that Gray died without a suspicion of the high
rank he was thereafter to hold in the annals of
British genius? What did poor Collins think
when he submitted his sublime odes to the flames?
He must have had fits of confidence, even then,
in himself; but intermixed with gloom and despair,
and curses of the wretched doom of his birth!
Is it sufficient that a man should wrap himself
up in himself, and be content if the poetry creates
itself and expires in his own heart? We strike
the lyre to excite sympathy, and, if no one will
hear, will any one not feel that he strikes in
vain; and that the talent given us is useless,
and even painful? But who can be assured that
he has the talent if no one acknowledges it?
To have it, and not to be assured that we have
it, is a restless fire that burns to consume us.</p>
<p>Let no one envy the endowments, if he looks
at the fate, of poets. Let him contemplate Spenser,
Denham, Rochester, Otway, Collins, Chatterton,
Burns, Kirke White, Bloomfield, Shelley,
Keats, and Byron, besides those of foreign countries!
Perhaps Collins was the most unhappy of
all; as he was assuredly one of the most inspired
and most amiable.</p>

<p>Langhorne&rsquo;s edition of Collins first appeared
in 1765, accompanied by observations which
have been generally appended to subsequent editions.
These observations have commonly borne
the character of feebleness and affectation; they
have a sort of pedantic prettiness, which is somewhat
repulsive, but they do not want ingenuity,
or justness of criticism. Part of them, at least,
had previously appeared in the Monthly Review,
probably written by Langhorne. Langhorne was
not deficient himself in poetical genius, but is
principally remembered by a single beautiful
stanza, &ldquo;Cold on Canadian hills,&rdquo; &amp;c. From
the time of Langhorne&rsquo;s first edition, Collins became
a popular poet; a miniature edition appeared
soon after that of Langhorne; and as
long as I can remember books, which goes
back at least to the year 1770, Collins&rsquo;s poems
were almost universally on the lips of readers of
English poetry. That Cowper, in 1784, should
speak of him as &ldquo;a poet of no great fame,&rdquo;
proves nothing, since Cowper&rsquo;s long seclusion
from the world had made him utterly ignorant
of contemporary literature. The negative inference,
from the omission of Beattie, is not of
much weight. I cannot recollect the date of
the article in the Monthly Review; but, as it
appears that Collins survived till 1759, I suspect
it was before Collins&rsquo;s death. It was in
September, 1754, that the Wartons visited him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxi' name='page_lxi'></a>lxi</span>
at Chichester: in that year he paid a visit to
Oxford, when it appears that he was suffering
under exhausture, not alienation, of mind.</p>
<p>The critics, and, among the rest, Mrs. Barbauld
and Campbell, have ascribed to him &ldquo;frequent
obscurity;&rdquo; this is unjust,&ndash;&ndash;his general
characteristic is lucidness and transparency: he
is never obscure, unless in the Ode to Liberty,
and, perhaps, in a few passages of the Ode on
the Manners. Campbell&rsquo;s criticism is, otherwise,
worthy of this beautiful poet, whom he
praises with congenial spirit. When Hazlitt
speaks of the &ldquo;tinsel and splendid patchwork&rdquo;
of Collins, &ldquo;mixed with the solid, sterling ore of
his genius,&rdquo; he speaks of a base material not to
be found there. In Collins there is no tinsel or
patchwork, one of his excellencies is, that the
whole of every piece is of one web; there are no
joinings or meaner threads. There is no height
to which Collins might not have risen, had he
lived long, had his mind continued sound, and
had he persevered in exercising his genius.
Campbell remarks that, at the same age, Milton
had written nothing which could eclipse his productions.</p>
<p>Of the two communications regarding Collins,
to which I have already alluded, one anonymous,
the other by a Mr. John Ragsdale, I must say
something more. The first, signed V., appeared
in the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, with the date of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxii' name='page_lxii'></a>lxii</span>
the 20th Jan. 1781. I well remember its publication,
and with what eagerness I read it. I
suspect it was at the very crisis of the appearance
of the last portion of Johnson&rsquo;s Lives, but possibly
a year earlier. I perused it with a mixture
of delight, melancholy, and disgust; the first
passage which struck me was this: &ldquo;As he
brought with him [to Oxford], for so the whole
tone of his conversation discovered, too high an
opinion of his school acquisitions and a sovereign
contempt for all academic studies and discipline,
he never looked with any complacency on his
situation in the University, but was always complaining
of the dulness of a college life. In
short, he threw up his demyship, and going to
London, commenced a man of the town, spending
his time in all the dissipation of Ranelagh,
Vauxhall, and the playhouses; and was romantic
enough to suppose that his superior abilities
would draw the attention of the great world, by
means of whom he was to make his fortune,&rdquo;
&amp;c., &amp;c.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Thus was lost to the world this unfortunate
person, in the prime of life, without
availing himself of fine abilities, which, if properly
improved, must have raised him to the top
of any profession, and have rendered him a blessing
to his friends, and an ornament to his country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vulgarity and narrow-mindedness of this
last paragraph filled me with indignation and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxiii' name='page_lxiii'></a>lxiii</span>
contempt. In a selfish point of view Collins
might, unquestionably, have done better by binding
himself to the trammels of a profession; but
would he have been more an honor to his friends
and an ornament to his country? Are the fruits
of genius he has left behind no ornament or use
to his country? Professional men, for the most
part, live for themselves, and not for the world.
Who now remembers Lord Camden, Lord Thurlow,
Lord Rosslyn, Lord Kenyon, Lord Ellenborough,
or a hundred episcopal or medical characters,
all rich and famous in their day?</p>
<p>The character of his person and habits we
read with deep interest. &ldquo;He was passionately
fond of music, good-natured, and affable, warm
in his friendships, and visionary in his pursuits;
and, as long as I knew him, very temperate in
his eating and drinking. He was of a moderate
stature, of a light and clear complexion, with
gray eyes, so very weak at times as hardly to
bear a candle in the room, and often raising
within him apprehensions of blindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter from Mr. John Ragsdale is addressed
to Mr. William Hymers, Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford,
dated &ldquo;Hill Street, Richmond, in Surrey,
July, 1783.&rdquo; He appears to have been a tradesman
in Bond Street; and he surveyed the character
of Collins (with whom he was familiar)
with a tradesman&rsquo;s eye. He reproached the poet
with idleness, not because he was lingering and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxiv' name='page_lxiv'></a>lxiv</span>
losing his time on the road to fame, but because
he omitted to get money by his pen. &ldquo;To raise
a present subsistence,&rdquo; says Ragsdale, &ldquo;he set
about writing his Odes; and having a general
invitation to my house, he frequently passed
whole days there, which he employed in writing
them, and as frequently burning what he had
written after he had read them to me: many of
them, which pleased me, I struggled to preserve,
but without effect; for, pretending he would
alter them, he got them from me, and thrust
them into the fire.&rdquo; That he wrote the Odes to
gain a present subsistence is but the tradesman&rsquo;s
mistaken comment.</p>
<p>Gray was about four years older than Collins,
and he survived him twelve years; he appears to
have spent these years in gloominess and spleen;
but we know not what intense pleasures he received
from his solitary studies, from the improvement
of his mind, from that exquisite taste and
increasing erudition of which every day added to
the stores. The enthusiasm of Collins was more
active and adventurous, and his erudition probably
more acute. Timidity and fastidiousness
were great defects in Gray; they kept down his
invention, and made him resort to the wealth of
others, when he could better have relied upon
himself. But as to borrowing expressions and
simple materials, no genius ever did otherwise;
it is the new and happy combination in which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxv' name='page_lxv'></a>lxv</span>
lies the invention. It may be doubted which are
now most popular, the Odes of Collins or of
Gray. On the one hand, what is most abstract
is least calculated for the general reader; on the
other hand, the variety of learned allusions in
Gray renders the style and thoughts of his most
celebrated Odes less simple, less direct, and less
easily comprehended at once; but then his deep
morality, the touching strokes which go immediately
to the heart, his sensibility to the common
sorrows of human life, his powerful reflection of
the sentiments which &ldquo;come home to every one&rsquo;s
business and bosom,&rdquo; form an attraction which
perhaps turns the scale in his favour. Of both
these sublime poets the correctness of composition
renders the writings a national good.</p>
<p>The French Revolution, which affected and
partly reversed the minds of all Europe, produced
a new era in our literature. There was good as
well as evil in the new force thus infused into the
human intellect. Our poetry had generally become
tame and trite; a sort of languid mechanism
had brought it into contempt; it was very little
read, and still less esteemed. This might be not
merely the effect, but also the cause of a deficiency
of striking genius in the candidates for
the laurel. Collins and Gray were dead; Mason
had hung up the lyre; and Thomas Warton was
then thought too laboured and quaint; Hayley
had succeeded beyond expectation by a return to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxvi' name='page_lxvi'></a>lxvi</span>
moral and didactic poetry at a moment when the
public was satiated by vile imitations of lyrical
and descriptive composition; but Cowper gave a
new impulse to the curiosity of poetical readers,
by a natural train of thought and the unlaboured
effusions of genuine feeling. There is no doubt
that a fearful regard to models stifles all force
and preeminent merit. The burst of the French
Revolution set the faculties of all young persons
free. It was dangerous to secondary talents, and
only led them into extravagances and absurdities.
To Wordsworth, Southey, Scott, it was the
removal of a weight, which would have hid the
fire of their genius. But the exuberance of their
inexhaustible minds in no degree lessens the value
of the more reserved models of excellence of a
tamer age. The contrast of their varied attractions
supplies the reader with opposite kinds of
merit, which delight and improve the more by
this very opposition.</p>
<p>Authors seldom estimate each other rightly in
their lifetimes. The race of poets, of whom the
last died with the century, had little friendship,
or even acquaintance among themselves; or
rather, they broke into little sets of two and
three, which narrowed their opinions and their
hearts; Gray and Mason, Johnson and the two
Wartons, Cowper and Hayley, Darwin and Miss
Seward; but Shenstone, Beattie, Akenside, Burns,
Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Smith, &amp;c. stood alone. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxvii' name='page_lxvii'></a>lxvii</span>
is not desirable. Innumerable advantages spring
from frank and generous communication. Collins
and Gray had not the most remote personal
knowledge of each other. Gray never mentions
Dr. Sneyd Davies, a poet and an Etonian, nearly
contemporary; nor Nicholas Hardinge, a scholar
and a poet also. Mundy, the author of Needwood
Forest, passed a long life in the country,
totally removed from poets and literati, except
the small coterie of Miss Seward, at Litchfield.
The lives of poets would be the most amusing of
all biography, if the materials were less scanty:
it is strange that so few of them have left any
ample records of themselves; of many not even
a letter or fragment of memorials is preserved.
None of Cowley&rsquo;s letters, a mode of composition
in which he is said to have eminently excelled,
have come down to us. Of Prior, Tickell, Thomson,
Young, Dyer, Akenside, the Wartons, there
are few of any importance known to be in existence.
Those of Hayley, which Dr. J. Johnson
has brought forward, are not of the interest which
might have been expected. Mrs. Carter&rsquo;s are
excellent, and many of Beattie&rsquo;s amusing and
amiable: it had been well for Miss Seward if
most of hers had been consigned to the flames.
Those of Charlotte Smith it has not been thought
prudent to give to the public. The greater part
of those of Lord Byron, which Moore has hitherto
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxviii' name='page_lxviii'></a>lxviii</span>
put forth, had better have been spared: they are
written in false taste, and are under a factitious
character: in general, the prose style of poets is
admirable;&ndash;&ndash;it was not Lord Byron&rsquo;s excellence.
We have no specimens of the prose of Collins:
it is grievous that he did not execute his project
of The History of the Revival of Literature, or of
the Lives for the Biographia Britannica, which
he undertook. Poets of research are, of all
authors, best qualified to write biography with
sagacity and eloquence; they see into the human
heart, and detect its most secret movements; and
if there be a class of literature more amusing and
more instructive than another, it is well written
biography.</p>
<p>We have a few poets who have not possessed
erudition; for genius will overcome all deficiencies
of art and labour, such as Shakespeare, Chatterton,
Burns, and Bloomfield: but it cannot be
questioned that erudition is a mighty aid. Milton
could never have been what he was without profound
and laborious erudition. Another necessary
knowledge is the knowledge of the human heart,
which no industry and learning will give. It is
an intuitive gift, which mainly depends on an
acute and correct imagination, and a sympathetic
sensibility of the human passions. Among the
innumerable rich endowments of Shakespeare this
was the first; it was the predominant brilliance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxix' name='page_lxix'></a>lxix</span>
of his knowledge which gave him correctness of
description, sentiment, and observation, and clearness,
force, and eloquence of language.</p>
<p>Collins had only reached the age of twenty-six
when his Odes were published: what inconceivable
power would the maturity of age have given
him? It is lamentable that he had no familiar
friend and companion from that period capable
of apprehending and remembering his conversations.
In his lucid intervals he must have said
many wise, many learned, and many brilliant
things; perhaps his very disease, in its vacillation
between light and darkness, may have struck out
many unexpected and surprising beauties, which
common attendants were utterly incapable of
appreciating. The flushes of the mind under the
unnatural impulses of malady are sometimes inimitably
splendid. His reason, at times, was
sound, for his reason was fervid to the last. But
it is said that his shrieks sometimes resounded
through the cathedral cloisters of Chichester till
the horror of those who heard him was insupportable.</p>
<p>All these speculations may appear tedious to
those whose curiosity is confined to facts: but
new facts regarding Collins are not to be had:
and what are facts unless they are accompanied
by reflections, conclusions, and sentiments? The
use of facts is to teach us to think, to judge, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxx' name='page_lxx'></a>lxx</span>
to feel: and facts, regarding men of genius, are
valuable in enabling us to contemplate how far
the gifts of high intellect contribute to our happiness,
or afford guides for the rest of mankind;
in what respects they have the possessors upon
an equality with the herd of the people; and
where they expose them to temptations from
which others are free. For these purposes the
ill fated Collins is a melancholy illustration: the
Muse had touched the lips of his infancy, and
infused her spirit into him; she had given him a
piercing understanding, and an amiable disposition
and temper; she enabled him to come forth
with poetry of the first class, in the earliest bloom
of youth; and to deserve, if not to win, the envied
laurel, which millions have reached at in
vain! What seeming glories and blessings were
these! Yet to how few was so much misery dispensed
as to this once envied being! May we
not hope that his spirit now has its mighty
reward?</p>
<p>Let it not be denied that there is high virtue in
the culture of the mind, when directed to pure
and elevated objects, and accustoming itself to
travel in lofty paths! The mind cannot attain
the necessary refinement, nor have its sight
cleared of the film of earthly grossness, unless
the heart throws off the dregs of coarser feeling,
and keeps its wings afloat on a lighter and airier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxxi' name='page_lxxi'></a>lxxi</span>
atmosphere. It may be said, that there have
been bad men who have been great poets: but
this position remains to be proved. The dissolute
men who have written verses have not been
great poets. Were Dante, Petrarch, Tasso,
Spenser, Shakespeare, Dryden, Pope, Thomson,
Burns, bad men? We know that Milton&rsquo;s character
was great and holy, whatever were his
politics: and who could be more virtuous than
Gray, Beattie, Cowper, and Kirke White? And
have we not virtuous poets among the living,&ndash;&ndash;men
whose native splendour and intellectual culture
have almost purified them into spirits? Let
us never cease to meditate on the dejected inspiration,
which could pour forth such strains as
these:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&ldquo;With eyes upraised, as one inspired,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Pale Melancholy sat retired;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And from her wild sequester&rsquo;d seat,</p>
<p class='indent2'>In notes by distance made more sweet,</p>
<p>Pour&rsquo;d through the mellow horn her pensive soul:</p>
<p class='indent2'>And, dashing soft from rocks around,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Bubbling runnels join&rsquo;d the sound;</p>
<p>Through glades and glooms the mingled measures stole,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Or o&rsquo;er some haunted stream with fond delay</p>
<p class='indent2'>Round a holy calm diffusing,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Love of peace and lonely musing,</p>
<p class='indent2'>In hollow murmurs died away.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>There are those who will think the praises thus
bestowed upon Collins extravagant. It is now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_lxxii' name='page_lxxii'></a>lxxii</span>
sixty years since I became familiar with him;
and I still think of him with unabated admiration.
When the calm judgment of age confirms
the passion of youth and boyhood, we cannot be
much mistaken in the merit we ascribe to him
who is the object of it.</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
</div>
<p>It is with the writings of mankind, in some measure,
as with their complexions or their dress;
each nation hath a peculiarity in all these, to distinguish
it from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The gravity of the Spaniard, and the levity of
the Frenchman, are as evident in all their productions
as in their persons themselves; and the
style of my countrymen is as naturally strong and
nervous, as that of an Arabian or Persian is rich
and figurative.</p>
<p>There is an elegancy and wildness of thought
which recommends all their compositions; and
our geniuses are as much too cold for the entertainment
of such sentiments, as our climate is
for their fruits and spices. If any of these beauties
are to be found in the following Eclogues, I
hope my reader will consider them as an argument
of their being original. I received them at
the hands of a merchant, who had made it his
business to enrich himself with the learning, as
well as the silks and carpets of the Persians.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
The little information I could gather concerning
their author, was, that his name was Abdallah,
and that he was a native of Tauris.</p>
<p>It was in that city that he died of a distemper
fatal in those parts, whilst he was engaged in
celebrating the victories of his favourite monarch,
the great Abbas.<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> As to the Eclogues themselves,
they give a very just view of the miseries
and inconveniences, as well as the felicities, that
attend one of the finest countries in the East.</p>
<p>The time of writing them was probably in the
beginning of Sha Sultan Hosseyn&rsquo;s reign, the
successor of Sefi or Solyman the Second.</p>
<p>Whatever defects, as, I doubt not, there will
be many, fall under the reader&rsquo;s observation, I
hope his candour will incline him to make the
following reflection:</p>
<p>That the works of Orientals contain many peculiarities,
and that, through defect of language,
few European translators can do them justice.</p>

<p>When Music, heavenly maid, was young,</p>
<p>While yet in early Greece she sung,</p>
<p>The Passions oft, to hear her shell,</p>
<p>Throng&rsquo;d around her magic cell,</p>
<p>Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,                             <span class="linenum">5</span></p>
<p>Possest beyond the Muse&rsquo;s painting:</p>
<p>By turns they felt the glowing mind</p>
<p>Disturb&rsquo;d, delighted, raised, refined;</p>
<p>Till once, &rsquo;tis said, when all were fired,</p>
<p>Fill&rsquo;d with fury, rapt, inspired,                                 <span class="linenum">10</span></p>
<p>From the supporting myrtles round</p>
<p>They snatch&rsquo;d her instruments of sound;</p>
<p>And, as they oft had heard apart</p>
<p>Sweet lessons of her forceful art,</p>
<p>Each (for Madness ruled the hour)                                 <span class="linenum">15</span></p>
<p>Would prove his own expressive power.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>First Fear his hand, its skill to try,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Amid the chords bewilder&rsquo;d laid,</p>
<p>And back recoil&rsquo;d, he knew not why,</p>

<p>Next Anger rush&rsquo;d; his eyes on fire,</p>
<p class='indent2'>In lightnings own&rsquo;d his secret stings:</p>
<p>In one rude clash he struck the lyre,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And swept with hurried hand the strings.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>With woful measures wan Despair                                   <span class="linenum">25</span></p>

<p>Still it whisper&rsquo;d promised pleasure,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!</p>
<p>Still would her touch the strain prolong;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,</p>
<p>She call&rsquo;d on Echo still, through all the song;                   <span class="linenum">35</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>And, where her sweetest theme she chose,</p>
<p class='indent2'>A soft responsive voice was heard at every close,</p>
<p>And Hope enchanted smiled, and waved her golden hair.</p>
<p>And longer had she sung;&ndash;&ndash;but, with a frown,</p>
<p class='indent4'>Revenge impatient rose:                                       <span class="linenum">40</span></p>
<p>He threw his blood-stain&rsquo;d sword, in thunder, down;</p>
<p class='indent4'>And, with a withering look,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The war-denouncing trumpet took,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>

<p>Were ne&rsquo;er prophetic sounds so full of woe!                       <span class="linenum">45</span></p>
<p class='indent4'>And, ever and anon, he beat</p>
<p class='indent4'>The doubling drum, with furious heat;</p>
<p>And though sometimes, each dreary pause between,</p>
<p class='indent4'>Dejected Pity, at his side,</p>
<p class='indent4'>Her soul-subduing voice applied,                              <span class="linenum">50</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>Yet still he kept his wild unalter&rsquo;d mein,</p>
<p>While each strain&rsquo;d ball of sight seem&rsquo;d bursting from his head.</p>
<p class='indent2'>Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fix&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class='indent4'>Sad proof of thy distressful state;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of differing themes the veering song was mix&rsquo;d;                 <span class="linenum">55</span></p>
<p class='indent4'>And now it courted Love, now raving call&rsquo;d on Hate.</p>

<p>Pour&rsquo;d through the mellow horn her pensive soul:</p>
<p class='indent2'>And, dashing soft from rocks around,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Bubbling runnels join&rsquo;d the sound;</p>
<p>Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Or, o&rsquo;er some haunted stream, with fond delay,                  <span class="linenum">65</span></p>
<p class='indent4'>Round an holy calm diffusing,</p>

<p>The oak-crown&rsquo;d Sisters, and their chaste-eyed Queen,             <span class="linenum">75</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>Satyrs and Sylvan Boys, were seen,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Peeping from forth their alleys green:</p>
<p>Brown Exercise rejoiced to hear;</p>

<p>Last came Joy&rsquo;s ecstatic trial:                                   <span class="linenum">80</span></p>
<p>He, with viny crown advancing,</p>
<p class='indent2'>First to the lively pipe his hand addrest;</p>

<p>They would have thought who heard the strain                      <span class="linenum">85</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>They saw, in Tempe&rsquo;s vale, her native maids,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Amidst the festal sounding shades,</p>
<p>To some unwearied minstrel dancing,</p>
<p>While, as his flying fingers kiss&rsquo;d the strings,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Love framed with Mirth a gay fantastic round:                   <span class="linenum">90</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And he, amidst his frolic play,</p>

<div class='variation'>
<p>While, own&rsquo;d by you, with smiles the Muse surveys</p>
<p>The expected triumph of her sweetest lays:</p>
<p>While, stretch&rsquo;d at ease, she boasts your guardian aid,</p>
<p>Secure, and happy in her sylvan shade:</p>
<p>Excuse her fears, who scarce a verse bestows,</p>
<p>In just remembrance of the debt she owes;</p>
<p>With conscious, &amp;c.</p>
</div>While, born to bring the Muse&rsquo;s happier days
<p>A patriot&rsquo;s hand protects a poet&rsquo;s lays,</p>
<p>While nursed by you she sees her myrtles bloom,</p>
<p>Green and unwither&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er his honour&rsquo;d tomb;</p>
<p>Excuse her doubts, if yet she fears to tell                        <span class="linenum">5</span></p>
<p>What secret transports in her bosom swell:</p>
<p>With conscious awe she hears the critic&rsquo;s fame,</p>
<p>And blushing hides her wreath at Shakespeare&rsquo;s name.</p>
<div class='variation'>
<p>Long slighted Fancy with a mother&rsquo;s care</p>
<p>Wept o&rsquo;er his works, and felt the last despair:</p>
<p>Torn from her head, she saw the roses fall,</p>
<p>By all deserted, though admired by all:</p>
</div>
<p>Hard was the lot those injured strains endured,</p>
<p>Unown&rsquo;d by Science, and by years obscured:                        <span class="linenum">10</span></p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<div class='variation'>
<p>And &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;shall Science still resign</p>
<p>Whate&rsquo;er is Nature&rsquo;s, and whate&rsquo;er is mine?</p>
<p>Shall Taste and Art but show a cold regard,</p>
<p>And scornful Pride reject the unletter&rsquo;d bard?</p>
<p>Ye myrtled nymphs, who own my gentle reign,</p>
<p>Tune the sweet lyre, and grace my airy train,</p>
<p>If, where ye rove, your searching eyes have known</p>
<p>One perfect mind, which judgment calls its own;</p>
<p>There every breast its fondest hopes must bend,</p>
<p>And every Muse with tears await her friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas then fair Isis from her stream arose,</p>
<p>In kind compassion of her sister&rsquo;s woes.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas then she promised to the mourning maid</p>
<p>The immortal honours which thy hands have paid:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My best loved son,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;shall yet restore</p>
<p>Thy ruin&rsquo;d sweets, and Fancy weep no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each rising art by slow gradation moves;</p>
<p>Toil builds, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
<p>Fair Fancy wept; and echoing sighs confess&rsquo;d</p>
<p>A fix&rsquo;d despair in every tuneful breast.</p>
<p>Not with more grief the afflicted swains appear,</p>
<p>When wintry winds deform the plenteous year;</p>
<p>When lingering frosts the ruin&rsquo;d seats invade                     <span class="linenum">15</span></p>

<p class='indent2'>Each rising art by just gradation moves,</p>
<p>Toil builds on toil, and age on age improves:</p>
<p>The Muse alone unequal dealt her rage,</p>

<p>Preserved through time, the speaking scenes impart</p>

<p>But every Muse essay&rsquo;d to raise in vain</p>
<p>Some labour&rsquo;d rival of her tragic strain:</p>
<p>Ilissus&rsquo; laurels, though transferr&rsquo;d with toil,</p>
<p>Droop&rsquo;d their fair leaves, nor knew the unfriendly soil.</p>
<p class='indent2'>As Arts expired, resistless Dulness rose;                       <span class="linenum">35</span></p>

<p>No more imperial, stoop&rsquo;d her conquer&rsquo;d head;</p>
<p>Luxuriant Florence chose a softer theme,</p>
<p>While all was peace, by Arno&rsquo;s silver stream.</p>
<p>With sweeter notes the Etrurian vales complain&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>And arts reviving told a Cosmo reign&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Their wanton lyres the bards of Provence strung,</p>

<p>And Cosmo own&rsquo;d them in the Etrurian shade:</p>
<p>Then, deeply skill&rsquo;d in love&rsquo;s engaging theme,</p>
<p>The soft Proven&ccedil;al pass&rsquo;d to Arno&rsquo;s stream:                       <span class="linenum">40</span></p>
<p>With graceful ease the wanton lyre he strung;</p>

<h2>OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.</h2>
</div>
<p>The genius of the pastoral, as well as of every
other respectable species of poetry, had its origin
in the east, and from thence was transplanted by
the muses of Greece; but whether from the continent
of the Lesser Asia, or from Egypt, which,
about the era of the Grecian pastoral, was the
hospitable nurse of letters, it is not easy to determine.
From the subjects, and the manner of
Theocritus, one would incline to the latter opinion,
while the history of Bion is in favour of the
former.</p>
<p>However, though it should still remain a doubt
through what channel the pastoral traveled westward,
there is not the least shadow of uncertainty
concerning its oriental origin.</p>
<p>In those ages which, guided by sacred chronology,
from a comparative view of time, we call
the early ages, it appears, from the most authentic
historians, that the chiefs of the people employed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
themselves in rural exercises, and that astronomers
and legislators were at the same time shepherds.
Thus Strabo informs us, that the history
of the creation was communicated to the Egyptians
by a Chaldean shepherd.</p>
<p>From these circumstances it is evident, not only
that such shepherds were capable of all the dignity
and elegance peculiar to poetry, but that
whatever poetry they attempted would be of the
pastoral kind; would take its subjects from those
scenes of rural simplicity in which they were conversant,
and, as it was the offspring of harmony
and nature, would employ the powers it derived
from the former, to celebrate the beauty and benevolence
of the latter.</p>
<p>Accordingly we find that the most ancient
poems treat of agriculture, astronomy, and other
objects within the rural and natural systems.</p>
<p>What constitutes the difference between the
georgic and the pastoral, is love and the colloquial
or dramatic form of composition peculiar to
the latter; this form of composition is sometimes
dispensed with, and love and rural imagery alone
are thought sufficient to distinguish the pastoral.
The tender passion, however, seems to be essential
to this species of poetry, and is hardly ever
excluded from those pieces that were intended to
come under this denomination: even in those
eclogues of the Am&oelig;bean kind, whose only purport
is a trial of skill between contending shepherds,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
love has its usual share, and the praises of
their respective mistresses are the general subjects
of the competitors.</p>
<p>It is to be lamented, that scarce any oriental
compositions of this kind have survived the ravages
of ignorance, tyranny, and time; we cannot
doubt that many such have been extant, possibly
as far down as that fatal period, never to be mentioned
in the world of letters without horror,
when the glorious monuments of human ingenuity
perished in the ashes of the Alexandrian
library.</p>
<p>Those ingenious Greeks, whom we call the
parents of pastoral poetry, were, probably, no
more than imitators, of imitators that derived
their harmony from higher and remoter sources,
and kindled their poetical fires at those then unextinguished
lamps which burned within the tombs
of oriental genius.</p>
<p>It is evident that Homer has availed himself of
those magnificent images and descriptions so frequently
to be met with in the books of the Old
Testament; and why may not Theocritus, Moschus,
and Bion have found their archetypes in
other eastern writers, whose names have perished
with their works? yet, though it may not be
illiberal to admit such a supposition, it would
certainly be invidious to conclude, what the malignity
of cavillers alone could suggest with regard
to Homer, that they destroyed the sources from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
which they borrowed, and, as it is fabled of the
young of the pelican, drained their supporters to
death.</p>
<p>As the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament
was performed at the request, and under
the patronage, of Ptolemy Philadelphus, it were
not to be wondered if Theocritus, who was entertained
at that prince&rsquo;s court, had borrowed some
part of his pastoral imagery from the poetical
passages of those books. I think it can hardly
be doubted that the Sicilian poet had in his eye
certain expressions of the prophet Isaiah, when
he wrote the following lines:</p>

<p>The cause, indeed, of these phenomena is very
different in the Greek from what it is in the Hebrew
poet; the former employing them on the
death, the latter on the birth, of an important
person: but the marks of imitation are nevertheless
obvious.</p>
<p>It might, however, be expected, that if Theocritus
had borrowed at all from the sacred writers,
the celebrated pastoral epithalamium of Solomon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
so much within his own walk of poetry, would
not certainly have escaped his notice. His epithalamium
on the marriage of Helena, moreover,
gave him an open field for imitation; therefore,
if he has any obligations to the royal bard, we
may expect to find them there. The very opening
of the poem is in the spirit of the Hebrew
song:</p>

<p>This description of Helen is infinitely above the
style and figure of the Sicilian pastoral: &ldquo;She is
like the rising of the golden morning, when the
night departeth, and when the winter is over and
gone. She resembleth the cypress in the garden,
the horse in the chariots of Thessaly.&rdquo; These
figures plainly declare their origin; and others,
equally imitative, might be pointed out in the
same idyllium.</p>
<p>This beautiful and luxuriant marriage pastoral
of Solomon is the only perfect form of the oriental
eclogue that has survived the ruins of time; a
happiness for which it is, probably, more indebted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
to its sacred character than to its intrinsic merit.
Not that it is by any means destitute of poetical
excellence: like all the eastern poetry, it is bold,
wild, and unconnected in its figures, allusions,
and parts, and has all that graceful and magnificent
daring which characterizes its metaphorical
and comparative imagery.</p>
<p>In consequence of these peculiarities, so ill
adapted to the frigid genius of the north, Mr.
Collins could make but little use of it as a precedent
for his Oriental Eclogues; and even in his
third eclogue, where the subject is of a similar
nature, he has chosen rather to follow the mode
of the Doric and the Latian pastoral.</p>
<p>The scenery and subjects then of the foregoing
eclogues alone are oriental; the style and colouring
are purely European; and, for this reason,
the author&rsquo;s preface, in which he intimates that
he had the originals from a merchant who traded
to the east, is omitted, as being now altogether
superfluous.<a name='FNanchor_0070' id='FNanchor_0070'></a><a href='#Footnote_0070' class='fnanchor'>[70]</a></p>
<p>With regard to the merit of these eclogues, it
may justly be asserted, that in simplicity of description
and expression, in delicacy and softness
of numbers, and in natural and unaffected tenderness,
they are not to be equaled by any thing
of the pastoral kind in the English language.</p>

<h3>ECLOGUE I.</h3>
</div>
<p>This eclogue, which is entitled Selim, or the
Shepherd&rsquo;s Moral, as there is nothing dramatic in
the subject, may be thought the least entertaining
of the four: but it is by no means the least
valuable. The moral precepts which the intelligent
shepherd delivers to his fellow-swains, and
the virgins their companions, are such as would
infallibly promote the happiness of the pastoral
life.</p>
<p>In impersonating the private virtues, the poet
has observed great propriety, and has formed
their genealogy with the most perfect judgment,
when he represents them as the daughters of
truth and wisdom.</p>
<p>The characteristics of modesty and chastity are
extremely happy and <i>peinturesque</i>:</p>

<p>Distrusting all, a wise, suspicious maid;</p>
<p>Cold is her breast, like flowers that drink the dew;</p>
<p>A silken veil conceals her from the view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two similes borrowed from rural objects are
not only much in character, but perfectly natural
and expressive. There is, notwithstanding, this
defect in the former, that it wants a peculiar propriety;
for purity of thought may as well be
applied to chastity as to modesty; and from this
instance, as well as from a thousand more, we
may see the necessity of distinguishing, in characteristic
poetry, every object by marks and
attributes peculiarly its own.</p>
<p>It cannot be objected to this eclogue, that it
wants both those essential criteria of the pastoral,
love and the drama; for though it partakes not
of the latter, the former still retains an interest in
it, and that too very material, as it professedly
consults the virtue and happiness of the lover,
while it informs what are the qualities</p>

<h3>ECLOGUE II.</h3>
</div>
<p>All the advantages that any species of poetry
can derive from the novelty of the subject and
scenery, this eclogue possesses. The route of a
camel-driver is a scene that scarce could exist in
the imagination of a European, and of its attendant
distresses he could have no idea.&ndash;&ndash;These
are very happily and minutely painted by our descriptive
poet. What sublime simplicity of expression!
what nervous plainness in the opening
of the poem!</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;In silent horror o&rsquo;er the boundless waste</p>
<p>The driver Hassan with his camels past.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The magic pencil of the poet brings the whole
scene before us at once, as it were by enchantment;
and in this single couplet we feel all the
effect that arises from the terrible wildness of a
region unenlivened by the habitations of men.
The verses that describe so minutely the camel-driver&rsquo;s
little provisions have a touching influence
on the imagination, and prepare the reader to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
enter more feelingly into his future apprehensions
of distress:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Bethink thee, Hassan, where shall thirst assuage,</p>
<p>When fails this cruise, his unrelenting rage!&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>It is difficult to say whether his apostrophe to the
&ldquo;mute companions of his toils&rdquo; is more to be admired
for the elegance and beauty of the poetical
imagery, or for the tenderness and humanity of
the sentiment. He who can read it without being
affected, will do his heart no injustice if he concludes
it to be destitute of sensibility:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear</p>
<p>In all my griefs a more than equal share!</p>
<p>Here, where no springs in murmurs break away,</p>
<p>Or moss-crown&rsquo;d fountains mitigate the day,</p>
<p>In vain ye hope the green delights to know,</p>
<p>Which plains more blest, or verdant vales, bestow:</p>
<p>Here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found,</p>
<p>And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Yet in these beautiful lines there is a slight error,
which writers of the greatest genius very frequently
fall into.&ndash;&ndash;It will be needless to observe
to the accurate reader, that in the fifth and sixth
verses there is a verbal pleonasm where the poet
speaks of the <i>green</i> delights of <i>verdant</i> vales.
There is an oversight of the same kind in the
Manners, an Ode, where the poet says,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Seine&rsquo;s blue nymphs deplore</p>
<p>In watchet weeds&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>This fault is indeed a common one, but to a
reader of taste it is nevertheless disgustful; and
it is mentioned here, as the error of a man of
genius and judgment, that men of genius and
judgment may guard against it.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins speaks like a true poet, as well in
sentiment as expression, when, with regard to the
thirst of wealth, he says,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Why heed we not, while mad we haste along,</p>
<p>The gentle voice of Peace, or Pleasure&rsquo;s song?</p>
<p>Or wherefore think the flowery mountain&rsquo;s side,</p>
<p>The fountain&rsquo;s murmurs, and the valley&rsquo;s pride,</p>
<p>Why think we these less pleasing to behold,</p>
<p>Than dreary deserts, if they lead to gold?&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>But however just these sentiments may appear
to those who have not revolted from nature and
simplicity, had the author proclaimed them in
Lombard Street, or Cheapside, he would not have
been complimented with the understanding of the
bellman.&ndash;&ndash;A striking proof, that our own particular
ideas of happiness regulate our opinions
concerning the sense and wisdom of others!</p>
<p>It is impossible to take leave of this most beautiful
eclogue, without paying the tribute of admiration
so justly due to the following nervous
lines:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;What if the lion in his rage I meet!&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Oft in the dust I view his printed feet:</p>
<p>And, fearful! oft, when day&rsquo;s declining light</p>
<p>Yields her pale empire to the mourner night,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>By hunger roused, he scours the groaning plain,</p>
<p>Gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train:</p>
<p>Before them death with shrieks directs their way,</p>
<p>Fills the wild yell, and leads them to their prey.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>This, amongst many other passages to be met
with in the writings of Collins, shows that his
genius was perfectly capable of the grand and
magnificent in description, notwithstanding what
a learned writer has advanced to the contrary.
Nothing, certainly, could be more greatly conceived,
or more adequately expressed, than the
image in the last couplet.</p>
<p>The deception, sometimes used in rhetoric and
poetry, which presents us with an object or sentiment
contrary to what we expected, is here introduced
to the greatest advantage:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell the youth, whom sighs could not detain,</p>
<p>Whom Zara&rsquo;s breaking heart implored in vain!</p>
<p>Yet, as thou go&rsquo;st, may every blast arise&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this, perhaps, is rather an artificial prettiness,
than a real or natural beauty.</p>

<h3>ECLOGUE III.</h3>

<p>That innocence, and native simplicity of manners,
which, in the first eclogue, was allowed to
constitute the happiness of love, is here beautifully
described in its effects. The sultan of Persia
marries a Georgian shepherdess, and finds in her
embraces that genuine felicity which unperverted
nature alone can bestow. The most natural and
beautiful parts of this eclogue are those where
the fair sultana refers with so much pleasure to
her pastoral amusements, and those scenes of
happy innocence in which she had passed her
early years; particularly when, upon her first
departure,</p>

<h3>ECLOGUE IV.</h3>
</div>
<p>The beautiful but unfortunate country where the
scene of this pathetic eclogue is laid, had been
recently torn in pieces by the depredations of its
savage neighbours, when Mr. Collins so affectingly
described its misfortunes. This ingenious
man had not only a pencil to portray, but a heart
to feel for the miseries of mankind; and it is
with the utmost tenderness and humanity he
enters into the narrative of Circassia&rsquo;s ruin, while
he realizes the scene, and brings the present
drama before us. Of every circumstance that
could possibly contribute to the tender effect this
pastoral was designed to produce, the poet has
availed himself with the utmost art and address.
Thus he prepares the heart to pity the distresses
of Circassia, by representing it as the scene of
the happiest love:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;In fair Circassia, where, to love inclined,</p>
<p>Each swain was blest, for every maid was kind.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>To give the circumstance of the dialogue a more
affecting solemnity, he makes the time midnight,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
and describes the two shepherds in the very act
of flight from the destruction that swept over
their country:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Sad o&rsquo;er the dews, two brother shepherds fled,</p>
<p>Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>There is a beauty and propriety in the epithet
wildering, which strikes us more forcibly, the
more we consider it.</p>
<p>The opening of the dialogue is equally happy,
natural, and unaffected; when one of the shepherds,
weary and overcome with the fatigue of
flight, calls upon his companion to review the
length of way they had passed. This is certainly
painting from nature, and the thoughts, however
obvious, or destitute of refinement, are perfectly
in character. But as the closest pursuit of nature
is the surest way to excellence in general, and to
sublimity in particular, in poetical description, so
we find that this simple suggestion of the shepherd
is not unattended with magnificence. There
is a grandeur and variety in the landscape he
describes:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;And first review that long extended plain,</p>
<p>And yon wide groves, already past with pain!</p>
<p>Yon ragged cliff, whose dangerous path we tried!</p>
<p>And, last, this lofty mountain&rsquo;s weary side!&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>There is, in imitative harmony, an act of expressing
a slow and difficult movement by adding to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
the usual number of pauses in a verse. This is
observable in the line that describes the ascent
of the mountain:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>And last || this lofty mountain&rsquo;s || weary side ||.</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Here we find the number of pauses, or musical
bars, which, in an heroic verse, is commonly two,
increased to three.</p>
<p>The liquid melody, and the numerous sweetness
of expression, in the following descriptive lines, is
almost inimitably beautiful:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet to the sight is Zabran&rsquo;s flowery plain,</p>
<p>And once by nymphs and shepherds loved in vain!</p>
<p>No more the virgins shall delight to rove</p>
<p>By Sargis&rsquo; banks, or Irwan&rsquo;s shady grove;</p>
<p>On Tarkie&rsquo;s mountain catch the cooling gale,</p>
<p>Or breathe the sweets of Aly&rsquo;s flowery vale.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Nevertheless, in this delightful landscape there is
an obvious fault; there is no distinction between
the plain of Zabran and the vale of Aly; they
are both flowery, and consequently undiversified.
This could not proceed from the poet&rsquo;s want of
judgment, but from inattention: it had not occurred
to him that he had employed the epithet
flowery twice within so short a compass; an
oversight which those who are accustomed to
poetical, or, indeed, to any other species of composition,
know to be very possible.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more beautifully conceived, or
more pathetically expressed, than the shepherd&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
apprehensions for his fair countrywomen, exposed
to the ravages of the invaders:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;In vain Circassia boasts her spicy groves,</p>
<p>For ever famed for pure and happy loves:</p>
<p>In vain she boasts her fairest of the fair,</p>
<p>Their eyes&rsquo; blue languish, and their golden hair!</p>
<p>Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief shall send;</p>
<p>Those hairs the Tartar&rsquo;s cruel hand shall rend.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>There is certainly some very powerful charm in
the liquid melody of sounds. The editor of these
poems could never read or hear the following
verse repeated, without a degree of pleasure otherwise
entirely unaccountable:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Their eyes&rsquo; blue languish, and their golden hair.&rdquo;</p>

with the same kind of anxious pleasure we feel
upon a temporary parting with a beloved friend.</p>

<h2>OBSERVATIONS</h2>
<h3>ON THE ODES, DESCRIPTIVE AND ALLEGORICAL.</h3>
</div>
<p>The genius of Collins was capable of every degree
of excellence in lyric poetry, and perfectly
qualified for that high province of the muse.
Possessed of a native ear for all the varieties of
harmony and modulation, susceptible of the finest
feelings of tenderness and humanity, but, above
all, carried away by that high enthusiasm which
gives to imagination its strongest colouring, he
was at once capable of soothing the ear with the
melody of his numbers, of influencing the passions
by the force of his pathos, and of gratifying the
fancy by the luxury of description.</p>
<p>In consequence of these powers, but, more
particularly, in consideration of the last, he chose
such subjects for his lyric essays as were most
favourable for the indulgence of description and
allegory; where he could exercise his powers in
moral and personal painting; where he could
exert his invention in conferring new attributes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
on images or objects already known, and described
by a determinate number of characteristics;
where he might give an uncommon &eacute;clat to his
figures, by placing them in happier attitudes, or
in more advantageous lights, and introduce new
forms from the moral and intellectual world into
the society of impersonated beings.</p>
<p>Such, no doubt, were the privileges which the
poet expected, and such were the advantages he
derived from the descriptive and allegorical nature
of his themes.</p>
<p>It seems to have been the whole industry of
our author, (and it is, at the same time, almost
all the claim to moral excellence his writings can
boast,) to promote the influence of the social virtues,
by painting them in the fairest and happiest
lights.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Melior fieri tuendo&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>would be no improper motto to his poems in
general; but of his lyric poems it seems to be
the whole moral tendency and effect. If, therefore,
it should appear to some readers, that he
has been more industrious to cultivate description
than sentiment, it may be observed, that his
descriptions themselves are sentimental, and answer
the whole end of that species of writing, by
embellishing every feature of virtue, and by conveying,
through the effects of the pencil, the
finest moral lessons to the mind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>Horace speaks of the fidelity of the ear in preference
to the uncertainty of the eye; but if the
mind receives conviction, it is certainly of very
little importance through what medium, or by
which of the senses it is conveyed. The impressions
left on the imagination may possibly be
thought less durable than the deposits of the
memory, but it may very well admit of a question,
whether a conclusion of reason, or an impression
of imagination, will soonest make it sway to the
heart. A moral precept, conveyed in words, is
only an account of truth in its effects; a moral
picture is truth exemplified; and which is most
likely to gain upon the affections, it may not be
difficult to determine.</p>
<p>This, however, must be allowed, that those
works approach the nearest to perfection which
unite these powers and advantages; which at
once influence the imagination, and engage the
memory; the former by the force of animated
and striking description, the latter by a brief, but
harmonious conveyance of precept: thus, while
the heart is influenced through the operation of
the passions or the fancy, the effect, which might
otherwise have been transient, is secured by the
co&ouml;perating power of the memory, which treasures
up in a short aphorism the moral of the
scene.</p>
<p>This is a good reason, and this, perhaps, is the
only reason that can be given, why our dramatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
performances should generally end with a chain
of couplets. In these the moral of the whole
piece is usually conveyed; and that assistance
which the memory borrows from rhyme, as it was
probably the original cause of it, gives it usefulness
and propriety even there.</p>
<p>After these apologies for the descriptive turn
of the following odes, something remains to be
said on the origin and use of allegory in poetical
composition.</p>
<p>By this we are not to understand the trope in
the schools, which is defined aliud verbis, aliud
sensu ostendere; and of which Quintilian says,
usus est, ut tristia dicamus melioribus verbis,
aut bon&aelig; rei gratia qu&aelig;dam contrariis significemus,
&amp;c. It is not the verbal, but the sentimental
allegory, not allegorical expression (which,
indeed, might come under the term of metaphor),
but allegorical imagery, that is here in question.</p>
<p>When we endeavour to trace this species of
figurative sentiment to its origin, we find it coeval
with literature itself. It is generally agreed, that
the most ancient productions are poetical; and
it is certain that the most ancient poems abound
with allegorical imagery.</p>
<p>If, then, it be allowed that the first literary
productions were poetical; we shall have little or
no difficulty in discovering the origin of allegory.</p>
<p>At the birth of letters, in the transition from
hieroglyphical to literal expression, it is not to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
wondered if the custom of expressing ideas by
personal images, which had so long prevailed,
should still retain its influence on the mind,
though the use of letters had rendered the practical
application of it superfluous. Those who
had been accustomed to express strength by the
image of an elephant, swiftness by that of a panther,
and courage by that of a lion, would make
no scruple of substituting, in letters, the symbols
for the ideas they had been used to represent.</p>
<p>Here we plainly see the origin of allegorical
expression, that it arose from the ashes of hieroglyphics;
and if to the same cause we should
refer that figurative boldness of style and imagery
which distinguish the oriental writings, we shall,
perhaps, conclude more justly, than if we should
impute it to the superior grandeur of eastern
genius.</p>
<p>From the same source with the verbal, we are
to derive the sentimental allegory, which is nothing
more than a continuation of the metaphorical
or symbolical expression of the several agents
in an action, or the different objects in a scene.</p>
<p>The latter most peculiarly comes under the
denomination of allegorical imagery; and in this
species of allegory, we include the impersonation
of passions, affections, virtues, and vices, &amp;c. on
account of which, principally, the following odes
were properly termed, by their author, allegorical.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>With respect to the utility of this figurative
writing, the same arguments that have been advanced
in favour of descriptive poetry will be of
weight likewise here. It is, indeed, from impersonation,
or, as it is commonly termed, personification,
that poetical description borrows its chief
powers and graces. Without the aid of this,
moral and intellectual painting would be flat and
unanimated, and even the scenery of material
objects would be dull, without the introduction
of fictitious life.</p>
<p>These observations will be most effectually
illustrated by the sublime and beautiful odes that
occasioned them; in those it will appear how
happily this allegorical painting may be executed
by the genuine powers of poetical genius, and
they will not fail to prove its force and utility by
passing through the imagination to the heart.</p>

professedly did, and probably for the same reasons;
but we do not find that he has copied him

<p>Sussex, in which county the Arun is a small

as well as to Collins: both these poets, unhappily,
became the objects of that pity by which
their writings are distinguished. There was a
similitude in their genius and in their sufferings.
There was a resemblance in the misfortunes and
in the dissipation of their lives; and the circumstances
of their death cannot be remembered
without pain.</p>

<h3>ODE TO FEAR.</h3>

<p>Mr. Collins, who had often determined to
apply himself to dramatic poetry, seems here,
with the same view, to have addressed one of the
principal powers of the drama, and to implore
that mighty influence she had given to the genius
of Shakespeare:</p>

<p>In the construction of this nervous ode, the
author has shown equal power of judgment and
imagination. Nothing can be more striking than
the violent and abrupt abbreviation of the measure
in the fifth and sixth verses, when he feels
the strong influence of the power he invokes:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>

<p>I see, I see thee near.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>The editor of these poems has met with nothing
in the same species of poetry, either in his own,

to the following description of Danger:

<p>Of some loose hanging rock to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>It is impossible to contemplate the image conveyed
in the two last verses, without those emotions
of terror it was intended to excite. It has,
moreover, the entire advantage of novelty to
recommend it; for there is too much originality
in all the circumstances, to suppose that the
author had in his eye that description of the
penal situation of Catiline in the ninth &AElig;neid:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Te, Catilina, minaci</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>The archetype of the English poet&rsquo;s idea was in
Nature, and, probably, to her alone he was indebted
for the thought. From her, likewise, he
derived that magnificence of conception, that
horrible grandeur of imagery, displayed in the
following lines:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;And those, the fiends, who, near allied,</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er Nature&rsquo;s wounds and wrecks preside;</p>

<p>Lifts her red arm, exposed and bare:</p>
<p>On whom that ravening brood of fate,</p>
<p>Who lap the blood of sorrow, wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That nutritive enthusiasm, which cherishes the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
seeds of poetry, and which is, indeed, the only
soil wherein they will grow to perfection, lays
open the mind to all the influences of fiction. A
passion for whatever is greatly wild or magnificent
in the works of nature seduces the imagination
to attend to all that is extravagant, however unnatural.
Milton was notoriously fond of high
romance and gothic diableries; and Collins, who
in genius and enthusiasm bore no very distant
resemblance to Milton, was wholly carried away
by the same attachments.</p>

<h3>ODE TO SIMPLICITY.</h3>
</div>
<p>The measure of the ancient ballad seems to have
been made choice of for this ode, on account of
the subject; and it has, indeed, an air of simplicity,
not altogether unaffecting:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&ldquo;By all the honey&rsquo;d store</p>

<p class='indent2'>In evening musings slow,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Sooth&rsquo;d sweetly sad Electra&rsquo;s poet&rsquo;s ear.&rdquo;</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>This allegorical imagery of the honeyed store, the
blooms, and mingled murmurs of Hybla, alluding
to the sweetness and beauty of the Attic poetry,
has the finest and the happiest effect: yet, possibly,
it will bear a question, whether the ancient
Greek tragedians had a general claim to simplicity
in any thing more than the plans of their
drama. Their language, at least, was infinitely
metaphorical; yet it must be owned that they
justly copied nature and the passions, and so far,
certainly, they were entitled to the palm of true
simplicity; the following most beautiful speech
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>

<p>This ode is so infinitely abstracted and replete
with high enthusiasm, that it will find few readers
capable of entering into the spirit of it, or of
relishing its beauties. There is a style of sentiment
as utterly unintelligible to common capacities,
as if the subject were treated in an unknown
language; and it is on the same account that
abstracted poetry will never have many admirers.</p>
<p>The authors of such poems must be content
with the approbation of those heaven-favoured
geniuses, who, by a similarity of taste and sentiment,
are enabled to penetrate the high mysteries
of inspired fancy, and to pursue the loftiest flights
of enthusiastic imagination. Nevertheless, the
praise of the distinguished few is certainly preferable
to the applause of the undiscerning million;
for all praise is valuable in proportion to the
judgment of those who confer it.</p>
<p>As the subject of this ode is uncommon, so are
the style and expression highly metaphorical and
abstracted: thus the sun is called &ldquo;the rich-hair&rsquo;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
youth of morn,&rdquo; the ideas are termed
&ldquo;the shadowy tribes of mind,&rdquo; &amp;c. We are
struck with the propriety of this mode of expression
here, and it affords us new proofs of the
analogy that subsists between language and sentiment.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more loftily imagined than the
creation of the cestus of Fancy in this ode: the
allegorical imagery is rich and sublime: and the
observation, that the dangerous passions kept aloof
during the operation, is founded on the strictest
philosophical truth: for poetical fancy can exist
only in minds that are perfectly serene, and in
some measure abstracted from the influences of
sense.</p>
<p>The scene of Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;inspiring hour&rdquo; is perfectly

free republics of Italy naturally engage his attention.&ndash;&ndash;Florence,
indeed, only to be lamented on
account of losing its liberty under those patrons
of letters, the Medicean family; the jealous Pisa,
justly so called, in respect to its long impatience
and regret under the same yoke; and the small
Marino, which, however unrespectable with regard
to power or extent of territory, has, at least, this
distinction to boast, that it has preserved its
liberty longer than any other state, ancient or
modern, having, without any revolution, retained
its present mode of government near fourteen
hundred years. Moreover the patron saint who
founded it, and from whom it takes its name,
deserves this poetical record, as he is, perhaps,

<h3>ODE TO EVENING.</h3>
</div>
<p>The blank ode has for some time solicited admission
into the English poetry; but its efforts,
hitherto, seem to have been in vain, at least its
reception has been no more than partial. It
remains a question, then, whether there is not
something in the nature of blank verse less
adapted to the lyric than to the heroic measure,
since, though it has been generally received in
the latter, it is yet unadopted in the former. In
order to discover this, we are to consider the different
modes of these different species of poetry.
That of the heroic is uniform; that of the lyric is
various; and in these circumstances of uniformity
and variety probably lies the cause why blank
verse has been successful in the one, and unacceptable
in the other. While it presented itself
only in one form, it was familiarized to the ear
by custom; but where it was obliged to assume
the different shapes of the lyric muse, it seemed
still a stranger of uncouth figure, was received
rather with curiosity than pleasure, and entertained
without that ease or satisfaction which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
acquaintance and familiarity produce.&ndash;&ndash;Moreover,
the heroic blank verse obtained a sanction
of infinite importance to its general reception,
when it was adopted by one of the greatest poets
the world ever produced, and was made the
vehicle of the noblest poem that ever was written.
When this poem at length extorted that applause
which ignorance and prejudice had united to
withhold, the versification soon found its imitators,
and became more generally successful than
even in those countries from whence it was imported.
But lyric blank verse had met with no
such advantages; for Mr. Collins, whose genius
and judgment in harmony might have given it so
powerful an effect, has left us but one specimen
of it in the Ode to Evening.</p>
<p>In the choice of his measure he seems to have
had in his eye Horace&rsquo;s Ode to Pyrrha; for this
ode bears the nearest resemblance to that mixed
kind of the asclepiad and pherecratic verse; and
that resemblance in some degree reconciles us to
the want of rhyme, while it reminds us of those
great masters of antiquity, whose works had no
need of this whimsical jingle of sounds.</p>
<p>From the following passage one might be induced
to think that the poet had it in view to
render his subject and his versification suitable to
each other on this occasion, and that, when he
addressed himself to the sober power of Evening,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
he had thought proper to lay aside the foppery
of rhyme:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&ldquo;Now teach me, maid composed,</p>
<p class='indent2'>To breathe some soften&rsquo;d strain,</p>
<p>Whose numbers, stealing through thy darkening vale,</p>
<p>May not unseemly with its stillness suit,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As, musing slow, I hail</p>
<p class='indent2'>Thy genial loved return!&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>But whatever were the numbers or the versification
of this ode, the imagery and enthusiasm it
contains could not fail of rendering it delightful.
No other of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s odes is more generally
characteristic of his genius. In one place we discover
his passion for visionary beings:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;For when thy folding-star arising shows</p>
<p>His paly circlet, at his warning lamp</p>
<p class='indent2'>The fragrant Hours, and Elves</p>
<p class='indent2'>Who slept in buds the day,</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And many a Nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge,</p>
<p>And sheds the freshening dew, and, lovelier still,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The pensive Pleasures sweet,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Prepare thy shadowy car.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>In another we behold his strong bias to melancholy:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me rove some wild and heathy scene,</p>
<p>Or find some ruin &rsquo;midst its dreary dells,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Whose walls more awful nod</p>
<p class='indent2'>By thy religious gleams.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>Then appears his taste for what is wildly grand
and magnificent in nature; when, prevented by
storms from enjoying his evening walk, he wishes
for a situation,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;That from the mountain&rsquo;s side</p>
<p>Views wilds and swelling floods;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>And through the whole, his invariable attachment
to the expression of painting:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;and marks o&rsquo;er all</p>
<p>Thy dewy fingers draw</p>
<p>The gradual dusky veil.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>It might be a sufficient encomium on this beautiful
ode to observe, that it has been particularly
admired by a lady to whom nature has given the
most perfect principles of taste. She has not
even complained of the want of rhyme in it; a
circumstance by no means unfavourable to the
cause of lyric blank verse; for surely, if a fair
reader can endure an ode without bells and
chimes, the masculine genius may dispense with
them.</p>

<h3>THE MANNERS.</h3>
<h4>AN ODE.</h4>
</div>
<p>From the subject and sentiments of this ode, it
seems not improbable that the author wrote it
about the time when he left the university; when,
weary with the pursuit of academical studies, he
no longer confined himself to the search of theoretical
knowledge, but commenced the scholar of
humanity, to study nature in her works, and man
in society.</p>
<p>The following farewell to Science exhibits a
very just as well as striking picture: for however
exalted in theory the Platonic doctrines may appear,
it is certain that Platonism and Pyrrhonism
are nearly allied:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell the porch, whose roof is seen,</p>
<p>Arch&rsquo;d with the enlivening olive&rsquo;s green:</p>
<p>Where Science, prank&rsquo;d in tissued vest,</p>
<p>By Reason, Pride, and Fancy drest,</p>
<p>Comes like a bride, so trim array&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>To wed with Doubt in Plato&rsquo;s shade!&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>When the mind goes in pursuit of visionary systems,
it is not far from the regions of doubt; and
the greater its capacity to think abstractedly, to
reason and refine, the more it will be exposed to,
and bewildered in, uncertainty.&ndash;&ndash;From an enthusiastic
warmth of temper, indeed, we may for
a while be encouraged to persist in some favourite
doctrine, or to adhere to some adopted system;
but when that enthusiasm, which is founded on
the vivacity of the passions, gradually cools and
dies away with them, the opinions it supported
drop from us, and we are thrown upon the inhospitable
shore of doubt.&ndash;&ndash;A striking proof of
the necessity of some moral rule of wisdom and
virtue, and some system of happiness established
by unerring knowledge, and unlimited power.</p>
<p>In the poet&rsquo;s address to Humour in this ode
there is one image of singular beauty and propriety.
The ornaments in the hair of Wit are of
such a nature, and disposed in such a manner, as
to be perfectly symbolical and characteristic:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Me too amidst thy band admit,</p>
<p>There where the young-eyed healthful Wit,</p>
<p>(Whose jewels in his crisped hair</p>
<p>Are placed each other&rsquo;s beams to share,</p>
<p>Whom no delights from thee divide)</p>
<p>In laughter loosed, attends thy side.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Nothing could be more expressive of wit, which
consists in a happy collision of comparative and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
relative images, than this reciprocal reflection of
light from the disposition of the jewels.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;O Humour, thou whose name is known</p>
<p>To Britain&rsquo;s favour&rsquo;d isle alone.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The author could only mean to apply this to the
time when he wrote, since other nations had produced
works of great humour, as he himself acknowledges
afterwards.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;By old Miletus,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all you taught the Tuscan maids,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The Milesian and Tuscan romances were by no
means distinguished for humour; but as they
were the models of that species of writing in
which humour was afterwards employed, they are,
probably for that reason only, mentioned here.</p>

<h3>THE PASSIONS.</h3>
<h4>AN ODE FOR MUSIC.</h4>
</div>
<p>If the music which was composed for this ode
had equal merit with the ode itself, it must have
been the most excellent performance of the kind
in which poetry and music have, in modern
times, united. Other pieces of the same nature
have derived their greatest reputation from the
perfection of the music that accompanied them,
having in themselves little more merit than that
of an ordinary ballad: but in this we have the
whole soul and power of poetry&ndash;&ndash;expression that,
even without the aid of music, strikes to the
heart; and imagery of power enough to transport
the attention, without the forceful alliance of corresponding
sounds! what, then, must have been
the effect of these united!</p>
<p>It is very observable, that though the measure
is the same, in which the musical efforts of Fear,
Anger, and Despair are described, yet, by the
variation of the cadence, the character and operation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
of each is strongly expressed: thus particularly
of Despair:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;With woful measures wan Despair&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Low, sullen sounds his grief beguiled,</p>
<p>A solemn, strange, and mingled air,</p>
<p class='indent2'>&rsquo;Twas sad by fits, by starts &rsquo;twas wild.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>He must be a very unskilful composer who could
not catch the power of imitative harmony from
these lines!</p>
<p>The picture of Hope that follows this is beautiful
almost beyond imitation. By the united
powers of imagery and harmony, that delightful
being is exhibited with all the charms and graces
that pleasure and fancy have appropriated to
her:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Relegat, qui semel percurrit;</p>
<p>Qui nunquam legit, legat.</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;But thou, O Hope, with eyes so fair,</p>
<p class='indent2'>What was thy delighted measure!</p>
<p>Still it whisper&rsquo;d promised pleasure,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!</p>
<p>Still would her touch the strain prolong,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,</p>
<p>She call&rsquo;d on Echo still through all the song;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And where her sweetest theme she chose,</p>
<p class='indent2'>A soft responsive voice was heard at every close,</p>
<p>And Hope enchanted smiled, and waved her golden hair.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>In what an exalted light does the above stanza
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
place this great master of poetical imagery and
harmony! what varied sweetness of numbers!
what delicacy of judgment and expression! how
characteristically does Hope prolong her strain,
repeat her soothing closes, call upon her associate
Echo for the same purposes, and display every
pleasing grace peculiar to her!</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;And Hope enchanted smiled, and waved her golden hair.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

</td></tr></table>
<p>The descriptions of Joy, Jealousy, and Revenge
are excellent, though not equally so. Those of
Melancholy and Cheerfulness are superior to
every thing of the kind; and, upon the whole,
there may be very little hazard in asserting, that
this is the finest ode in the English language.</p>

<p>This poem was written by our author at the
university, about the time when Sir Thomas Hanmer&rsquo;s
pompous edition of Shakespeare was printed
at Oxford. If it has not so much merit as the
rest of his poems, it has still more than the subject
deserves. The versification is easy and genteel,
and the allusions always poetical. The

<h4>ODE ON THE DEATH OF THOMSON.</h4>
</div>
<p>Mr. Collins had skill to complain. Of that
mournful melody, and those tender images, which
are the distinguishing excellencies of such pieces
as bewail departed friendship, or beauty, he was
an almost unequaled master. He knew perfectly
to exhibit such circumstances, peculiar to
the objects, as awaken the influences of pity;
and while, from his own great sensibility, he felt
what he wrote, he naturally addressed himself to
the feelings of others.</p>
<p>To read such lines as the following, all-beautiful
and tender as they are, without corresponding
emotions of pity, is surely impossible:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&ldquo;The tender thought on thee shall dwell;</p>
<p>Each lonely scene shall thee restore,</p>
<p class='indent2'>For thee the tear be duly shed;</p>
<p>Beloved till life can charm no more,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And mourn&rsquo;d till Pity&rsquo;s self be dead.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The Ode on the Death of Thomson seems to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
been written in an excursion to Richmond by
water. The rural scenery has a proper effect in
an ode to the memory of a poet, much of whose
merit lay in descriptions of the same kind; and
the appellations of &ldquo;Druid,&rdquo; and &ldquo;meek Nature&rsquo;s
child,&rdquo; are happily characteristic. For the
better understanding of this ode, it is necessary
to remember, that Mr. Thomson lies buried in
the church of Richmond.</p>

<p>This tradition is mentioned by several of our old historians.

probability of the fact by arguments drawn from the correspondent

<p>There is a tradition in the Isle of Man, that a mermaid
becoming enamoured of a young man of extraordinary beauty
took an opportunity of meeting him one day as he walked on
the shore, and opened her passion to him, but was received
with a coldness, occasioned by his horror and surprise at her
appearance. This, however, was so misconstrued by the sea
lady, that, in revenge for his treatment of her, she punished
the whole island by covering it with a mist: so that all who
attempted to carry on any commerce with it, either never
arrived at it, but wandered up and down the sea, or were on
a sudden wrecked upon its cliffs. C.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
