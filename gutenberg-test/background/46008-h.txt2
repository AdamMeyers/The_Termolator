THE ROOM
WITH THE TASSELS
CHAPTER I
Wanted: A Haunted House
       But I know it       s so,       for Mrs. Fairbanks saw
it herself,       and heard it, too!       
The air of finality in the gaze levelled
at Braye defied contradiction, so he merely smiled
at the girl who was doing the talking. But, talking
or silent, Eve Carnforth was well worth smiling at.
Her red hair was of that thin, silky, flat-lying sort,
that spells temper, but looks lovely, and her white,
delicate skin,       perhaps the least bit hand-painted,       showed
temperament while her eyes, of the colour
called beryl,       whatever that is,       showed all sorts
of things.
Then from her canna-hued lips fell more wisdom.
       And Professor Hardwick believes it, too, and
he       s                     
       A college professor,        broke in Landon,        don       t
try to gild his refinement! But really, Eve, you
mustn       t believe in spooks,       it isn       t done                     
[012]
       Oh, but it is! You       ve no idea how many people,       scientific
and talented people,       are leaning toward
spiritualism just now. Why, Sir Oliver Lodge
says that after the war great and powerful assistance
will be given by spirit helpers in matters of
reconstruction and great problems of science.       
Milly Landon       s laugh rang out, and she politely
clapped a little, fat hand over her mouth to stifle it.
Milly Landon was an inveterate giggler, but
don       t let that prejudice you against her. She was
the nicest, dearest dumpling of a little woman who
ever giggled her way through life. And as hostess
on this present Sunday afternoon occasion, she sat,
one foot tucked under her, on the davenport in her
long, narrow parlour, on one of New York       s East
Seventieth streets.
It was a parlour like thousands of others in the
city, and the quartette of people talking there were
much like the people talking in those other parlours,
that Sunday afternoon. Their only superiority lay
in the fact that they constitute part of the personnel
of this absorbing tale, and the other people do
not.
Milly and her very satisfactory husband, Wynne
Landon, were affably entertaining Rudolph Braye
and the herein-before described Eve Carnforth, two
pleasing callers, and the talk had turned on psychological
matters and then, by inevitable stages, to the
supernatural and spiritualism.
[013]
       It is all coming in again,        Eve declared, earnestly.
       You know it was taken very seriously
about thirty or forty years ago, and then because
of fake mediums and fraudulent s        ances, it fell
into disrepute. But now, it       s being taken up in earnest,
and I, for one, am terribly interested.       
       But it       s so old-fashioned, Eve,        and Milly
looked at her guest in disdain.
       It       s gammon and spinach, that       s what it is,       
declared Landon,        very rubbishy gammon and a
poor quality of spinach!       
       Queen Victoria didn       t think so,        Eve informed
them.        She may have been old-fashioned, but she
believed thoroughly in the spiritual reappearance of
her friends who died, and especially took comfort
in the communion and visitation of her dead husband.       
       It       s this way, I think,        offered Braye;        it seems
to me it       s like that old        Lady or the Tiger        story,
you believe or not, according to your character or
disposition. You know, it depended on your own
nature, whether you think the Lady came out of the
door, or the Tiger. And so with spooks, if you
want to believe in them, you do.       
       Don       t say spooks, please,        begged Eve;        say
phantasms, or even ghosts.       
       Is that the usage in the best mediumistic circles?       
and Braye smiled.        Well, I think I could
more easily believe in a spook than a phantasm.
The latter sounds so unreal, but a good honest
Injun spook seems sort of plausible.       
[014]
       They       re all unreal,        began Landon, but Eve interrupted.
       They       re not unreal, Wynne; they       re
immaterial, of course, but that isn       t being unreal.
You have a real soul, haven       t you, although it is immaterial?
and I suppose you don       t call your mind
material, even if your brain is.       
       Now you       re quibbling, Eve,        and Landon grew
a bit more serious.        When I say unreal, I mean
imperceptible to the senses. I hold that a departed
spirit cannot return to earth and be seen, heard, or
felt by mortal human beings. All the stories of
such things to the contrary notwithstanding. If
you or any one else has power to show me a visible
spook,       I beg pardon, phantasm,       I       ll be glad to
see it, but I       m from Missouri. I wouldn       t be a bit
afraid of it, but I       d have to be jolly well convinced
of its integrity. No faked-up spectres would go
down with me!       
       But how can you know?        asked Milly.        I       d
be scared to death of one, I       m sure, but if Wynne
wants to see one, I do. Let       s all go to a s        ance, or
whatever they call the things. Shall us?       
       No, indeed!        cried Eve.        Professional
s        ances are always fakes. And I don       t aspire to
see one. If we could get some messages from the
beyond, that would satisfy me.       
       Get messages how?        asked Braye.
       Oh, by a Ouija board, or some such way.       
       Ouija!        derided Landon;        that       s the biggest
fraud of all!       
[015]
       Only in the hands of frauds. If we tried it
here by ourselves and if we all trusted each other
not to stoop to deception of any sort that would be
a fair test.       
       I       d like that,        and Milly giggled in pleased anticipation.
       That wouldn       t frighten me, and I       d
promise to play fair.       
       There       d be no reason for not playing fair,        said
Eve, seriously.        We       re not a pack of silly children
who want to trick one another. If we could get
together some evening and have an earnest, serious
test, I       d agree. But not if there       s to be the least
suspicion of anybody trying trickery.       
At this point two more callers arrived, and Milly
jumped up to greet them.
       Mr. Bruce!        she exclaimed,        how nice to see
you! And Vernie,       my goodness, how you       ve
grown!       
       Indeed, yes,        and Vernie Reid, a most lively
and energetic sub-deb of sixteen, darted from one
to another, greeting all with interest.
       Hello, Cousin Rudolph, what are you doing
here? Mooning after Miss Carnforth, I s       pose.
Dear Mrs. Landon, let me sit here by you. I want
to show you my graduating gifts.       
       Oh, yes, you       ve just had commencement,
haven       t you?       
[016]
       Yes, and Uncle Gifford gave me this heavenly
wrist-watch, and my respected Cousin Rudolph,
over there, sent me this pendant. Isn       t it stunning?
Oh, I had beautiful presents. I       d like to graduate
every year!       
       Aren       t you going to school any more at all?       
       Dunno yet. Uncle Gifford says I am, I say
I       m not. It remains to be seen. Though I don       t
mind confiding to you that I usually get my own
way. And, too, out in Chicago, you know, we       re
not such terrible highbrows. Something tells me
my schooldays are over. I think Uncle Gif needs
the pleasure of my society at home. And, too, I
want to get acquainted with Cousin Rudolph. Until
this week I haven       t seen him for years.       
       He isn       t your cousin, Vernie.       
       Same as. He       s a son of Uncle Gif       s half-brother,
and I       m a daughter of Uncle       s own sister,
so it sort of evens up. Anyway, I like Cousin
Rudolph, because he       s such a good-looking young
man, and he       s promised to take me round New York
some. That       s why I       m so jealous of Miss Carnforth
or any other girl.       
Vernie was so pretty that her chatter amused
the whole crowd. She was brown-haired and
brown-eyed, and somewhat of a browned complexion,
by reason of much tennis and outdoor life
at the school from which she had just been graduated.
And after a summer spent among the Eastern
resorts, she and her Uncle were to return to
their Chicago home, where they had lived all of
Vernie       s orphaned life. Gifford Bruce idolized the
girl and though often short and crabbed in his
manner to others, he was never cross or stern to his
dead sister       s child.
[017]
       What were you talking about when we came
in?        Vernie asked, smiling at Milly.        You were
all so in earnest, it must have been something important.       
       Of ghosts,        answered Braye, looking at the
pretty child.        Do you enjoy them?       
       Oh, don       t I!        cried Vernie.        Why, at school
we just ate        em up! Table tippings and all such
things, as soon as lights were out!       
       We don       t mean that sort,        said Eve.        We
were talking seriously.       
       Count me out, then,        laughed Vernie.        Our
ghosts weren       t a bit real. I did most of        em myself,
jogging the table, when the others didn       t know
it!       
Eve       s scarlet lips came together in a narrow line,
but the others laughed at Vernie as she
babbled on.
       Yes, and we tried the Ouija board. I can make
it say anything I want to.       
       Good for you, Kiddie,        cried Braye,        I believe
I like your notion of these things better than
the ideas of the psychologists. It sounds a lot more
fun!       
[018]
       And comes nearer the truth,        declared Mr.
Bruce.        I       ve looked up these matters and I       ve
read all the best and most authoritative books on
the subjects. There are many writers more diffuse
and circumstantial, but Andrew Lang sums up the
whole situation in his able way. He says there are
no ghosts, but there are hallucinations. And that
explains all.       
       It doesn       t to me,        and Eve       s beryl eyes took on
a mystic, faraway look.        I, too, have read a lot
of books                     
       Scientific or psychic?        interrupted Mr. Bruce,
acidly.
       Psychical and Theosophic                     
       Rubbish! The Theosophic bunch have been in
the discard for years.       
       That       s what I say,        put in Milly,        the whole
business is old-fashioned.       
       It isn       t a question of fashion,        and Gifford
Bruce spoke assuredly;        the subject is one that
recurs in waves, as many such things do. Why,
there have been ghosts and haunted houses in people       s
imagination ever since there has been man and
a house for him to live in. Some are spoken of
in the Bible, the primitive Australians had legions
of ghosts, the awful Dyaks record them, and there
is scarce a castle or palace of the middle ages that
hasn       t its Woman in White, or a Little Gray Lady
or the Man in Black. And in an old Egyptian
papyrus, there       s an account of a defunct lady who
insisted on haunting her husband to his great distaste.       
[019]
       My goodness, Uncle Gif, you do know a lot
about it!        and Vernie went over and sat on the
arm of his chair.        Tell us more. I like this sort
of ghost stories better than the fool stunts we did
at school.       
       I       m not telling ghost stories, child, I       m only
declaring that ghost stories are merely stories, and
in no case a true relation of happenings. Lang investigated
thousands of cases, and in ten out of
every eleven, he states, fraud was proved.       
       Quite so,        said Eve,        and it is that eleventh
case that interests the real thinker, the true
inquirer.       
       But the eleventh case was simply not proven,
it never has been shown that it was really a ghostly
visitation.       
       But they do say, Uncle Gifford,        observed
Braye,        that the very fact of the frauds being perpetrated
proves that there was something to imitate.
If no spirit had ever returned to earth and made
itself manifest, no one would have thought of pretending
that one did.       
       Nonsense and super-nonsense! Why, Rudolph,
perpetual motion is not a real thing, but
how many times has it been pretended! You don       t
remember the Keeley Motor, but that deceived thousands
into believing that perpetual motion was at
last discovered, but it wasn       t; and that fraud
doesn       t prove that perpetual motion, without adequate
cause, exists.       
[020]
       Here comes Professor Hardwick,        exclaimed
Milly,        splendid to have him come just now! Sit
down, Professor, and get right into the game. You
know all these people, except this angel child, Miss
Vernie Reid.       
       I am an angel,        declared Vernie,        but I       m no
child! I       ve just graduated with honours and diplomas
and lots of presents. Now, I       m out in the
great world, and glory, but I love it! But don       t
mind me, Professor, go right on and tell us all you
know about ghosts and ghostesses.       
       Bless my soul! I don       t know anything about
them.       
       Well, do you believe in ghosts?       
       What do you mean by ghosts? How do you
define a ghost?       
       Ah, there       s the rub,        said Landon.        These
people are all talking at cross purposes. Mr. Bruce
means a scarecrow phantom rigged up in sheets,
Miss Carnforth means a supernatural being of
some sort, but I take a ghost, in the proper
sense, to mean the visible soul of some one who
has died.       
       What do you mean by visible soul? Disembodied?       
       No,        considered Landon,        I suppose I mean
clothed in a body,       that is an apparent body.       
       And raiment?        asked the old Professor.
       Yes, certainly. I never heard of a nude
spook!       
[021]
       Then your visible soul is concealed by a body
of flesh, and clothes, of fabric, or, at least, apparently so.
The soul, I take it, would show but low
visibility.       
       Good, Hardwick!        cried Mr. Bruce.        Give
them a jolt, they need it,       talking such rubbish!       
       Rubbish, Bruce? What do you mean by rubbish?       
       Why, all this ghost gabble                     
       How do you know it       s rubbish? Have you
personally disproved it? Do you mean intentional
rubbish? Are they talking deceptively, or are they
themselves deceived?       
       By the Lord Harry, Hardwick, I had forgotten
you were such a stickler for words! I must choose
my diction carefully. Do you, then, believe that so-called
supernatural appearances are caused by psychical
influences or are hallucinations of the senses?
There, I think I       ve put it clearly.       
       Fairly so. But I can       t answer clearly. I never
express an opinion on a grave question                     
Milly       s hand flew up to her mouth to repress an
involuntary giggle.        A grave question!        she exploded.
       It surely is.       
The Professor looked at her thoughtfully.        It
is,        he went on,        and it is no laughing matter. As
I was saying, I never state an opinion without being
sure of my facts. Now, I       ve had no experience,
personally, with supernatural matters, and so am
unfit to discuss them. But, I admit I should be
very glad to have some such experience. Yes, I
certainly should.       
[022]
       Really,        and Eve Carnforth looked interested.
       I can arrange it for you, Professor Hardwick.       
       No, no, my dear lady, I do not mean that I
want to go to a s        ance, where the so-called medium
throws flowers and things out of a cabinet, or toots
trumpets and bangs cymbals! No, thank you, I       ve
seen such often.       
       What would you choose as an experience?       
asked Landon.
       I       d like to go to a house that is reputed haunted,
and in circumstances that preclude all possibility of
fraud, see the haunting spirits or hear them, for
myself.       
       Me, too!        cried Vernie.        Oh, I do think that
would be the rippingest fun! If you ever do it,
Professor, mayn       t I go with you?       
       I       ll go along,        said Eve.        Wouldn       t that be
a splendid proof! To have such a scientific and
open-minded man as the Professor, and a few
others who are in earnest and anxious to learn.
You couldn       t go, Mr. Bruce. You are too sceptical.       
       I       m just the one you need,        he laughed.        A
balance wheel to keep you enthusiasts straight.
But haunted houses are not to be found on every
bush in America. If we were in England now,       or
Scotland.       
       They do have some over here,        Landon asserted.
       I read of one recently, and I       ve heard of
others.       
[023]
       Let       s find one,        suggested Eve,        and spend our
summer vacation in it! Wouldn       t that be a lark?       
       Oh, do!        exclaimed Vernie.        I       d just love
it! May I go, Uncle Gifford? Oh, please let me.       
       Only if I go myself, child. The spooks,       I beg
their pardon, phantasms, might carry you off. I       ll
have to go along to rescue you.       
       Phantasms don       t carry people off,        said Eve,
contemptuously.        And though I       d like to consider
this plan, I       d only do so, if we were all in earnest
as investigators, whatever our opinions may be.       
       Come on, let       s go,        said Landon.        I think it
a great little old scheme. Make up a party, you
know, but every one who joins must promise to be
earnest and honest. Must promise to do nothing to
fool or mislead the others, but keep a fair and open
mind for any developments. Of course, there won       t
be any developments, but we can have a jolly time
and we can have wild discussions.       
       Wynne would rather have a discussion than
eat,        said his wife.        I       ll go, and I       ll be the housekeeper
and chaperon of the crowd, if, as Wynne
says, there       ll be no developments. I       d love the outing,
and I think this a splendid party to belong to.
And let       s take Norma Cameron. She       s a sensitive,
or whatever you call it, and she       ll help you out,
Eve.       
       Why make the party any larger?        asked Eve,
a little petulantly.        The crowd here now seems
just right and congenial and all that.       
[024]
       Why lug in Norma?        said Braye, smiling.        I
don       t know said Norma, but I agree with Eve that
the party here is just sort of complete.       
       Yes, I will take Norma. The poor child never
gets an outing, and she       d just love this chance.       
       You talk as if we were going to a summer
resort,        said Landon.        In the first place, Milly,
I doubt if we can find a properly haunted house in
a pleasant locality, that is for rent.       
       Of course we can       t,        declared Mr. Bruce.
       The whole scheme is idiotic. But if you can
work it out, Landon, I       ll go along, and take this
little piece of property.        He looked smilingly at
the eager-eyed Vernie.        She       s due for some fun
after her school work, and if she likes this stunt,
let       s try to put it over.       
       How would you set out to find a house?        asked
Braye.
       Advertise,        said Landon, promptly.        I know
a firm of real estate agents, that I       ll bet could
manage it in short order. Say we try it?       
       I       m going to take Norma,        insisted Milly.
       Mayn       t I, Wynne?       
       Take anything or anybody you wish, my cherished
one. But then, oughtn       t we to have another
man?       
       Yes,        said Milly, decidedly.        I hate a bunch
of hens, without plenty of menfolks about. Who
knows a nice, good-natured, all round adaptable
dinner man?       
[025]
       I know just the chap,        said Braye,        but he       s a
minister. Or, at least, he used to be. But he       s an
awfully good fellow, and most agreeable parlour
company.       
       What       s his name?        asked Landon.
       Tracy. I met him first in Chicago, some years
ago, and I       ve always liked him.       
       All right, if Milly asks Norma, you ask your
friend, but it       s a case of first catch your house!       
       It       s got to be a nice house, and fairly comfortable,       
Milly stipulated,        or I won       t go.       
       It       s got to have a well-authenticated ghost, or I
won       t go,        laughed Braye.        I don       t believe in the
things, but I       d like to have a chance to hear their
clanking chains, or whatever they perform on.       
       I       ll go just for the fun of the thing,        said
Vernie,        and if we do catch a ghost, so much the
better!       
[026]
CHAPTER II
The Old Montgomery Place
At the Fisher and Hibbard Real Estate and
Country House Agency, Wynne Landon had
a spirited interview with their Mr. Fisher, and
finally induced that somewhat unwilling gentleman
to advertise for a haunted house.
       It       s a purely business matter,        Landon argued,
       and if you       re any sort of a live agency you ought
to do your best to get for your clients any such
peculiar domiciles as they may desire.       
       I understand that,        patiently explained Mr.
Fisher,        but it       s such a crazy thing to do. How
would a dignified firm like ours look advertising for
a house warranted haunted?       
       Don       t use your own firm name, then. Have
answers sent to a fictitious address. Oh, you can
manage it, Fisher. I don       t mean you can surely
get one, but you can manage to try. And if the
house is pleasant and attractive, it doesn       t matter,
between you and me, if there isn       t any ghost, after
all. But I want a bona fide story. I mean, I don       t
want a house that the owner pretends is haunted,
just so he can rent it. It must be a well-known
legend or ghost story connected with the place.       
[027]
       There are plenty of such,        and Fisher laughed.
       I       ve struck them occasionally, and because of that
well-authenticated story, known to all the neighbours,
I couldn       t rent them. To have one asked for
is a new experience here.       
       Well, I       ve told you the whole state of the case.
You see why we want it, and though the ghost part
is the primary factor with some of us, my wife
and I care more about a pleasant setting for a
month       s house party.       
Landon       s personality went far toward gaining his
end, and Mr. Fisher promised to do what he could.
As a lawyer of fine standing, and a man of ample
means, Wynne Landon was a desirable man to
please, and the order was taken.
And when, a few weeks later, word came that a
possible opportunity had offered, Landon telephoned
for Braye to go with him, and they went to investigate
it at once.
       It       s this way,        said Mr. Fisher to the listening
men.        There       s a big house up in Vermont,       in
the Green Mountain region, not so very far from
Manchester. But it       s a lonely locality, quite high
up, and near a lake.       
       Sounds fine so far,        commented Landon;        go
on.       
[028]
       A man named Stebbins is the owner. I haven       t
seen him, but here       s his letter. Read it, you       ll get
the idea better than I can tell you.        So they
read:

       Fisher and Hibbard:
       Dear sirs:
       I       ve got a house, and it sure is haunted. It       s
up here in the mountains, and it       s a good house, and
a big one, but in some disrepair. Leastways, things
is old-fashioned, and not, as you may say, up to
date. But nothing ornery. All high-toned and
proper, only old and somewhat wore out. It       s the
old Montgomery mansion, built along about 1700
and something. But it       s been added to since, and
it       s a sort of mixed up architecture. About forty
rooms into it, I should judge, though I ain       t never
counted them. And most of them haunted. But
they ain       t no use going into particulars unless somebody
really wants to rent it. I       ve tried nineteen
years, and nobody       ll take it, cause it       s so lonesome
like. It       s called Black Aspens, mostly I guess,
cause the thick groves of aspen trees all around look
black at night, and Lord knows it       s a fit place for
ghosts. Anyway it       s haunted and I can swear to
that. But the story of the haunt I won       t set down
until I hear from you again. But you can take my
affydavy it       s a real haunt and there       s a real reason
for it.
       Yours truly,
       Elijah Stebbins.       

       Sounds good to me; what do you think, Rudolph?       
said Landon.
[029]
       All right, if it       s genuine. Some of us ought
to go up there and size it up before the whole crowd
goes. Think so?       
       Yes, unless we can get a photograph, or some
sort of a plan of the place. And, you know, Braye,
I don       t care such a lot about a ghost, if we can get
a good intelligent crowd of people together. That       s
the only sort of vacation I care for. I wouldn       t
give a picayune for a month in a big summer hotel,
or a little summer boarding-house, where you may
meet good talkers and you may not. But with Eve
Carnforth and Norma Cameron and the Professor
and, pardon the bouquet, you, I foresee some good
old chin-chins. And, add to this, picturesque, even
wild mountain scenery, I somehow think we       re in
for a good time.       
       I agree. Wish Uncle Gif and Vernie weren       t
going, though. He       s a dictatorial old chap, though
a good sport, and as to Vernie, I don       t think it       s the
right place for a flapper.       
       Oh, it won       t hurt the kiddie. She       s a mighty
sensible little piece and she       s ready to eat up experiences.
She may as well be with her own people.       
       That       s just it. She       s lived nearly all her life
alone with Uncle, and he isn       t enough people for
her. She ought to have a woman to look after her,
now she       s out of school.       
       Well, what       s the matter with Milly? For this
trip at least. Milly loves the little girl, and will
have a good influence over her.       
[030]
       That       s right as rain, but I       m not sure Eve
Carnforth is desirable company for Vernie.       
       Oh, Eve isn       t a bad sort. And with her strict
Uncle, and you and Milly and me to look after the
child, Eve can       t do much to counteract.       
       She probably won       t do anything. It       s all right,
Wynne. Now shall we decide to take this Montgomery
place?       
       Oh, no, we can       t decide positively. I       m pretty
sure we shall take it, but I think we ought to call
a confab of the whole bunch to discuss it.       
Meantime, Eve Carnforth was talking it over
with Milly Landon.
       I adore the plan,        Eve said,        except your insistence
on taking Norma Cameron. I don       t like
her, Milly, and you know it.       
       Now, Eve, cunnin        little cherub child, don       t let
the greeny-weeny-eyed monster claim you for his
own! You know perf       ly well,        Milly giggled,        that
you don       t want Norma along, because you think she
will attract Friend Braye.       
       Why, Milly Landon! What nonsense! I don       t
care two cents for Rudolph Braye                     
       Oh, I don       t mean romantically, but I do know
you want to be top of the psychic heap, up there, and
you think little Norma will get ahead of you in
phantasmagoria, or whatever you call it.       
       No, it isn       t that; but Norma does think she
knows it all, and she puts on such airs about her
clairvoyance, and calls herself a sensitive and all
that.       
[031]
       Well, let her. You can hold your own; and,
too, Eve, if we carry out this scheme, I think we
ought all to pull together, and help each other. And
we can       t do that, if there       s antagonism or rivalry.
Now, can we? And if you       re in earnest, as you       ve
always insisted you are, you ought to be glad of
any help Norma can give. She feels that way about
you. When I asked her to go, she was delighted
that you were to be in the party, because, she said,
you were so interested and so well up in all these
things we       re going to discover.       
       I suppose I am silly. I may as well confess I       m
not sure of Norma. She wouldn       t be above pretending
she heard or saw things, even if she
didn       t.       
       Fiddlesticks! There won       t be any pretending!
Or, if there is, it       ll be discovered right straight off.
Why, Wynne is terribly in earnest,       about having
it all fair and square, I mean,       and so is the Professor,
and I       d like to see any one fool Gifford
Bruce! And little Vernie is a real wideawake.
There won       t be anything doing that that child
doesn       t know, if it       s fraud or foolery! Don       t you
believe it, my dear. Norma Cameron won       t pull
any wool over anybody       s eyes in our party. No,
siree!       
The crowd came together that night to discuss
the house that had been offered, and to come to a
decision.
[032]
Norma Cameron was present, and her manner
and appearance were so exactly opposite to those
of Eve Carnforth, that it was small wonder the
girls were not congenial.
Norma was blonde, and had what her friends
called a seraphic countenance and her enemies, a
doll-face. For Norma had enemies. She was
prominent in war relief work and public charities
of many kinds, and it is seldom possible for such
a one to go through the world entirely peaceably.
But all conceded that her doll-face was a very pretty
one, and few who criticized it, would not have been
glad to wear it.
Her golden hair was softly curly, and her sky
blue eyes big and expressive. But her complexion
was her greatest beauty; soft as a rose petal, the
pink and white were so delicately blended as to
make a new observer suspect art       s assistance. A
second glance, however, removed all such suspicion,
for no hare       s foot could ever have produced that
degree of perfection. Her softly rounded chin, and
creamy throat were exquisitely moulded, and her
usual expression was gentle and amiable.
But Norma was no namby-pamby character, and
her eyes could turn to deep violet, and her pink
cheeks flush rosily if she ran up against unjustice
or meanness. That was why her career of philanthropy
was not always a serene path, for she never
hesitated to speak her mind and her mind was of
a positive type.
[033]
Always outspoken, though, was Norma. No
slyness or deceit marked her procedure, never did
she say behind any one       s back what she would not
say to his face.
And this was the principal reason why Norma
and Eve could never hit it off. For Eve frequently
carried tales, and sometimes denied them later.
Milly, however, was friends with both girls, and
secretly hoped that if they could all get away together,
the two warring natures might react on each
other for good. Then, too, both were immensely
interested in psychics, and if they were rivals in
this field, so much better chance for all concerned,
to find out the things they were to look for.
       I think,        said Norma, at the confab,        it would
be better for two of the crowd, say, Mr. and Mrs.
Landon, to go up first and look at the house. It
sounds fine, but it may be impossible. So, why get
us all up there, only to come home again?       
       I don       t think so,        said Eve, promptly, while
Milly giggled to hear the two begin to disagree at
once.        I think it would be a lot more fun for us
all to go and see it for the first time together.
Then, if it isn       t livable, we can all come back, but
we shall have had a sort of picnic out of it, at
least.       
       Yes, I think that, too!        put in Vernie, who was
beside herself with joy at the outlook.        Oh, what
a gorgeous party it will be! Do we go in the train,
or motors or what?       
[034]
       Hush, Vernie,        said her Uncle,        we haven       t
decided to go at all, yet. Where is this place,
Landon?       
       The post-office is East Dryden. The house is
about a mile further up the mountain. I fancy it       s
a picturesque sort of a place, though with few modern
appointments. Fisher got a little more data,
somehow, and he says it       s a hodge-podge old pile,
as to architecture, as it       s been rebuilt, or added to
several times. But I don       t care about all that, I
mean, if we don       t like the appointments we needn       t
stay. What I want is the ghost story. Shall we
send to Stebbins for that before we take the place,
or go on a wild goose chase entirely?       
       Oh, let       s start off without knowing anything
about it,        and old Mr. Bruce       s eyes twinkled like a
boy       s at thought of an escapade.
       Good for you, Uncle!        and Vernie shouted
with glee.        I didn       t know you were such an old
top, did you, Cousin Rudolph?       
       Well, I       ve known him longer than you have,
Flapper, and I       m not so surprised at his wanting
a sporting proposition. But, I say, Milly, if we       re
going to take Tracy, you people ought to see him
and give him the once over first. Maybe you won       t
like him at all.       
       Oh, your friends are sure to be our friends,
Rudolph,        said Landon,        but telephone him to run
up here, can       t you? It       s only fair to let him in on
the planning.       
[035]
Tracy came, and he made good at once. His
ministerial air was softened by a charming smile and
a certain chivalry of address that pleased the women
and satisfied the men.
       What about servants?        he asked, after the main
details had been explained to him.
       That       s what I       m thinking about,        said Milly.
       I don       t want to take our servants, they       d be scared
to death in such a place, and, too, we can       t go
ghost hunting under Charles        nose! He       d sniff
at us!       
       Right you are!        agreed Landon.        Charles is
one estimable and valuable butler, but he       s no sort
to take on the picnic we       re out for.       
       Don       t let       s take any servants,        suggested Eve,
       but get some up there. Natives, you know.       
       That would be better,        said Mr. Bruce.        Then,
they       ll be used to the place, and can tell us of the
legends and traditions, you see.       
       You       re poking fun,        said Eve, reproachfully,
       but it       s true, all the same. Do we go in
motors?       
       I think so,        said Landon.        Two big cars
would take us all, and we can leave our luggage to
be sent up if we stay.       
       Of course we       ll stay,        asserted Milly.        I love
that old house already, and if there       s no ghost at
all, I       ll be just as well pleased, and I       ll stay the
month out, with whoever wants to stay with me.       
[036]
       I       ll stand by you,        said Norma,        and I       ll own
up that I don       t really expect any spectral manifestations
up there, anyway.       
       It matters little what you expect,        and Professor
Hardwick looked at her thoughtfully.
       We       re going investigating, not expecting.       
       Don       t you expect anything, Prof?        asked
Vernie, gaily.
       What do you mean by expect, child? Do you
mean wish or think?       
       Gracious, goodness, Professor! I never know
what I mean by the words I use, and I never
care!       
Professor Hardwick       s hobby was the use of
words, and rarely did he fail to question it, if a
word was misused or uncertainly used in his presence.
But he smiled benignly on the pretty child,
and didn       t bother her further.
Finally, the men drew together to make up the
budget of necessary expenses and the women talked
clothes.
       Smocks all round,        said Norma, who loved the
unconventional in dress.
       Not for me!        said Eve, who didn       t.
Milly giggled.        Let every one wear just what
she chooses,        she settled it.        I       m at my best in
white linen in the summer time, but what about
laundry? Well, I shall leave two sets of things
packed, and then send for whichever I want.       
[037]
Norma, uninterested in clothes, edged over
toward the men. Though a friend of the Landons
and acquainted with Professor Hardwick, she had
never met Braye or Tracy before.
Both succumbed to her sure-fire smile, but Tracy
showed it and Braye didn       t.
       Sit here, Miss Cameron,        and Tracy eagerly
made a place for her at his side;        we need a lady
assistant. How much do you think it ought to cost
to provision nine people and two or three natives
for a month?       
       It isn       t a question of what it ought to cost,       
returned Norma,        but what it will cost. But in
any case it will be less than most of us would spend
if we went to the average summer hotel. So why
not just put down some round numbers, divide        em
by nine and let it go at that?       
       Fine!        approved Landon.        No food dictator
could beat that scheme! I wonder if ghost-hunters
are as hungry as other hunters, or if we       ll be so
scared we       ll lose our appetites.       
       I have a profound belief in ghosts,        Norma
asserted,        but I shall only indulge in it between
meals. Count me in for all the good things going,
three times a day.       
       What do you mean by profound?        asked the
Professor;        deep-seated or widely informed?       
       Both,        answered Norma, flashing her pretty
smile at the serious old man.        Profundity of all
kinds is my happy hunting-ground, and on this trip
I expect to get all the profundity I want.       
[038]
       And I       m the girl to put the fun in profundity,       
cried Vernie, coming over to them.        My mission
is to keep you serious people joyed up. Mr. Tracy,
your profession won       t interfere with your having a
jolly time, will it? No, I see it won       t, by that
twinkly little smile.       
       You may count on me,        said the clergyman
a bit stiffly, but with a cordial glance at the
girl.
       And I can wind Professor Hardwick round my
finger,        Vernie went on,        for a companion on a
gay lark, I don       t know any one better than a dry-as-dust
old college professor!       
The object of this encomium received it with a
benignant smile, but Gifford Bruce reproved his
saucy niece.
       I       ll leave you at home, miss, if you talk impertinences,       
he declared.
       Not much you won       t, my bestest, belovedest
Uncle! Why, I       m the leading lady of this troupe.
And I expect the spectre will appear to me first of
all. That       s my motto:        Spect the Spectre! How       s
that? Then the rest of you can inspect the
spectre!       
       Vernie! don       t be so excruciatingly funny,       
begged Braye, while Milly Landon giggled at the
pretty child, whose charm and sweetness took all
rudeness from her foolery.
       Perhaps we ought to call in an inspector to
inspect the spectre,        contributed Landon.
[039]
       There, there, Wynne,        said Braye,        we       ll take
such stuff from an ignorant little girl but not from a
grown-up man.       
       Ignorant, huh!        scorned Vernie.        I       ll bet
you couldn       t have passed my examination in psychology!       
       Perhaps not,        admitted Braye,        but after this
trip of ours, we       ll all be honour men.       
       I want it thoroughly understood,        said Mr.
Bruce,        that I range myself on the side of the
sceptics. I don       t want to sail under false colours
and I wish to state positively that there are no
ghosts or phantasms or any such things. Moreover,
I announce my intention of fooling you gullible
ones, if I can.       
       Oh, that isn       t fair!        exclaimed Landon.        I
don       t believe in the things either, but I want an
honest test. Why, you take away the whole point
of the experiment if you       re going to put up a trick
on us!       
       No, no, Bruce,        said the Professor,        that won       t
do. Come, now, give me your word there       ll be no
hocus-pocus or I refuse to go at all.       
       If it       s any sort of a real test, Hardwick, it
oughtn       t to be possible to fool you.       
       That       s true,        said Eve;        and I       m not afraid of
any tricks. If they are tricks, I       ll know it                     
       I too,        said Norma.        I       m sensitive to all
psychical manifestations and if I can       t tell a real
phantasm from Mr. Bruce       s tricks, I deserve to be
fooled.       
[040]
       I think it       s a good thing that Mr. Bruce warned
us,        observed John Tracy.        It puts us on our
guard. But I think the rest of us ought to agree
not to do anything of that sort. We can expect
and discount Mr. Bruce       s little game, but if others
are going to do the same, it seems to me the game
isn       t worth playing.       
       Right you are!        declared Landon, and forthwith
everybody present except Gifford Bruce
solemnly pledged his or her word to do nothing
tricky or fraudulent, and to preserve an open-minded,
honest attitude toward any developments
they might experience.
       And with eight argus-eyed inquirers watching
him, Mr. Bruce can       t put anything over,        opined
Landon, and the others agreed.
[041]
CHAPTER III
Black Aspens
Though mid-July, it was a chilly dusk
through which the two motor cars ascended
the last stretch of mountain road toward the
old Montgomery mansion. The sun set early behind
the Green Mountains and the house, half-way
up an eastern slope, appeared faintly through the
shadows.
To the right, tall forest trees waved their topmost
branches with an eerie, soughing sound, or stood,
menacingly silent, in black, sullen majesty. Beneath
them a tangled underbrush gave forth faint,
rustling hints of some wild life or suddenly ceased
to a grim stillness.
Then the road lay through a thick grove of
aspens, close, black and shivering as they stood, sentinel
like and fearsome, only dimly outlined against
the dark, clouded sky. Once in the grove, the
shadows were dense, and the quivering sounds
seemed intensified to a muttered protest against
intrusion. A strange bird gave forth a few raucous
notes, and then the dread silence returned.
[042]
A quick, damp chill foreboded still water and the
road followed the margin of a small lake or pond,
sinister in its inky depths, which mirrored the still
blacker aspen trees.
Suddenly, in a small clearing, they came upon the
house. In the uncertain light it seemed enormous,
shapeless and beyond all words repelling. It seemed
to have a personality, defiant and forbidding, that
warned of mystery and disaster. Aspen trees, tall
and gaunt, grew so close that their whispering leaves
brushed the windows, and crowded in protecting,
huddled clumps to ward off trespassers.
No lights showed through the deep caverns of the
windows, but one faint gleam flickered above the
entrance door.
       Whew!        cried Landon, jumping from his seat
with a thud on the stone terrace,        I won       t go
through that woods again! I       ll go home in an aeroplane,       and
I       m ready to go now!       
       So am I,        said Milly, in a quivering, tearful
voice.        Oh, Wynne, why did we ever come?       
       Now, now,        cheered Braye,        keep your heads,
it       s all right. Only these confounded shadows make
it impossible to know just where we       re at. Here       s
the house, and by jinks, it       s built of marble!       
       Of course,        said the Professor, who was curiously
feeling of the old ivy-grown stone,        this is
the marble country, you know. Vermont marble
was plenty enough when this house was put up.       
       Let       s get in,        begged Vernie.        It isn       t as
much fun as I thought it would be.       
[043]
They went, in a close group, up a short flight of
broad marble steps and reached a wide portico, in
the centre of which was a spacious vestibule indented
into the building, and which stood within
the main wall. Though the walls of the house were
of marble, those of this vestibule were of panelled
mahogany, and the entrance doorway was flanked
on either side by large bronze columns, which stood
half within and half without the mahogany wall.
       Some house!        exclaimed Tracy, in admiration
of the beautiful details, which though worn and
blackened by time, were of antique grandeur.
       These bronze doors must have come from Italy.
They       re marvellous. I       m glad I came.       
       Oh, do get in, Wynne,        wailed Milly.        You
can examine the house to-morrow. I wish we hadn       t
come!       
Landon was about to make search for knocker
or bell, when one of the big bronze doors swung
open, and a man peered out.
       You folks here?        he said, a bit unnecessarily.
       Bring another lamp, Hester.       
       Yes, we       re here,        Landon assured him,        and we
want to get in out of the wet!       
       Rainin       ?        and the man stepped out of the door
to look, blocking all ingress.
       No! that       s a figure of speech!        Landon       s
nerves were on edge.        Open that door,       the
other one,       let us in!       
       Go on in, who       s henderin        you?        and the indifferent
host stepped out of the way.
[044]
Landon went in first and Braye followed, as the
others crowded after. At first they could see only
a gloomy cavernous hall, its darkness accentuated
by one small lamp on a table.
       Thought I wouldn       t light up till you got here,       
and the man who had admitted them came in and
closed the door.        I       m Stebbins, and here       s the
keys. This is the house you       ve took, and Hester
here will look after you. I       ll be goin       .       
       No, you won       t!        and Landon turned on him.
       Why, man, we know nothing of this place. You
stay till I dismiss you. I want a whole lot of information,
but not till after we get lights and make
the ladies comfortable.       
       Comfortable! At Black Aspens! Not likely.       
The mocking laugh that accompanied these words
struck terror to most of his hearers.        Nobody told
me that you folks came up here to be comfortable.       
       Shut up!        Landon       s temper was near the
breaking point.        Where       s that woman with the
lamps? Where       s the man I engaged to look after
things?       
       Hester, she       s here. She       ll be in in a minute.
Thorpe, that       s her husband, he       s goin        to be a sort
of butteler for you, he can       t come till to-morrow.
But Hester, she       s got supper ready, or will be, soon       s
you can wash up and all.       
Hester came in then, a gaunt, hard-featured
New England woman, who looked utterly devoid of
any emotion and most intelligence.
[045]
Stebbins, on the other hand, was apparently of
keen perceptions and average intellect. His small
blue eyes roved from one face to another, and
though he looked sullen and disagreeable of disposition,
he gave the effect of one ready to do his
duty.
       All right,        he said, as if without interest,        I       ll
set in the kitchen and wait. Hester here, she       ll take
the ladies to their rooms, and then after you get
your supper, I       ll tell you all you ask me. But I
rented this place to you, I didn       t agree to be a signboard
and Farmers        Almanac.       
       All right, old chap,        and Landon smiled faintly,
       but don       t you get away till I see you. Now, girls,
want to select your rooms?       
       Y-Yes,        began Eve, bravely, and then a glance
up the dark staircase made her shudder.
       What we want is light,       and plenty of it,       
broke in Braye.        Here you, Hester, I       ll relieve
you of that lamp you       re holding, and you hop it,
and get more,       six more,       twelve more       hear
me?       
       We haven       t that many in the house.        Dull-eyed
the woman looked at him with that sublime
stolidity only achieved by born New Englanders.
       Oh, you haven       t! Well, bring all you have and
to-morrow you manage to raise a lot more. How
many have you, all told?       
       Four, I think.       
[046]
       Four! For a party of nine! Well, have you
candles?       
       Half a dozen.       
       And three candlesticks, I suppose! Bring them
in, and if you       re shy of candlesticks, bring old
bottles,       or anything.       
       Good for you, Braye, didn       t know you had so
much generalship,        and Gifford Bruce clapped his
nephew on the shoulder.        I       m glad I don       t believe
in ghosts, for every last one of you people are
shaking in your shoes this minute! What       s the
matter with you? Nothing has happened.       
       It was that awful ride through the woods,        said
Vernie, cuddling into her uncle       s arm.        I l-like it,       I
like it all,       but, the local colour is so       so
dark!       
       That       s it, Kiddie,        said Braye,        the local colour
is about the murkiest I ever struck. But here are
our lights, hooray!       
Hester brought two more small hand lamps, and
after another trip to the kitchen brought six candles
and six battered but usable candlesticks.
A candle was given to each of the four women,
and Norma politely selected the oldest and most
broken holder.
       Land sake!        exclaimed Stebbins, coming in,
       you goin        to use that candlestick? That       s the very
one the murderin        woman used!       
With a scream, Norma dropped it and no one
moved to pick it up.
[047]
       Get out, Stebbins!        roared Landon,        you queer
the whole business.       
       I       ll take this one,        and Mr. Bruce picked up the
old brass affair;        I       m not afraid of such things.
Here, Miss Cameron, take mine, it       s new and commonplace,
I assure you.       
White-faced and trembling, Norma took the cheap
crockery thing, and shortly they all followed Hester
up the stairs to the shadows of the floor above.
The place was silent as the grave. Hester       s slippered
feet made no sound, and a voluntary scraping
of Tracy       s shoes stopped as soon as he realized its
enormous sound in those empty halls. A multitude
of doors led to rooms in all directions, there seemed
to be no plan or symmetry of any sort. The candle
flames flickered, the small lamps burned with a pale
sickly light.
Hester paused midway of the main corridor.
       What rooms you want?        she asked, uninterestedly.
       Give me a cheerful one,        wailed Milly.        Oh,
Wynne, let us take a little, cozy one.       
       Of course you shall,        said Braye, kindly.
       Hester, which is the pleasantest room in the
house? Give that to Mr. and Mrs. Landon! And
then we       ll put all you girls near them. The rest
of us will camp anywhere.       
       Let       s all pretty much camp anywhere till to-morrow,       
suggested the Professor.        I       d like to
select my room by daylight.       
[048]
       I       ve made up some of the rooms, and some I
ain       t,        volunteered Hester.
       Then, for Heaven       s sake, show us the made-up
rooms, and get out!        burst forth Landon.        I wish
we       d brought our maids, Milly; that woman affects
me like fever and ague.       
But after a time they were assigned to various
more or less inhabitable bedrooms, and as quickly
as possible, all reappeared in the great hall below,
ready for supper.
The dining room, toward the back of the house,
was not half bad, after all the available lights had
been commandeered for the table.
       You knew there were no electrics,        said Braye
to Eve, who was bewailing the fact.
       Of course I did, and I thought candles would
be lovely and picturesque and all that; and kerosene
gives a good soft light, but       well, somehow,       do
you know what I thought as we came through that
dreadful wood?       
       What?       
       Only one sentence rang through my mind,       and
that was,       The Powers of Darkness!       
       That isn       t a sentence,        objected the Professor,
a little querulously, and everybody laughed. Also,
everybody blessed the occasion for laughter.
But Eve went on.        I don       t care if it       s a sentence
or a syllogism, or what it is! It just rang in
my ears. And I tell you this whole place is under
the Powers of Darkness                     
[049]
       Do hush, Eve,        pleaded Milly.        I was just
beginning to pull myself together, and now you       ve
upset me again!       
       But Milly,                     
       Let up, Eve! For the love of Mike, let up!
You       re enough to give anybody the creeps.       
Landon glared at her.
       It       s only a question of light,        Tracy broke in, in
his pleasant way.        Now, we       ve light enough for
the moment, and to-morrow we       ll make this the
house of a thousand candles and a hundred lamps,
and a few lanterns if you like. Incidentally, Friend
Hester makes first-rate doughnuts.       
       Aren       t they bully!        chimed in Vernie.        I       ve
eaten six, and here goes for another.       
       Lucky they       re small,        said her uncle.        But
seven doughnuts are enough to make you see the
ghost of old Montgomery himself!       
       And all the Green Mountain boys,        added
Tracy, who was determined to keep conversation
away from fearsome subjects.
By the time they had finished the meal, every one
felt more at ease, Landon had recovered his poise,
and Milly her cheerfulness.
       Now, then,        the Professor asked, as they left
the table,        shall we explore the house to-night                     
[050]
       Lord, no!        cried Braye.        Leave it lay till
daylight. Also, don       t quiz old Stebbins as to who       s
who in Black Aspens! Let       s turn on the Victrola
and dance, or let       s play poker or sing glees, or anything
that       s a proper parlour trick. But nothing, I
insist, pertaining to our mission up here. That       ll
keep.       
       As you like,        and now Landon could smile.
       And you mollycoddles may pursue those light-minded
pleasures. But I       m going to have it out
with Steb, because I want to know some several
Laws for Beginners. But, don       t let me interfere
with your plans. Go ahead, and have play        Hide
and Seek All Over the House,        if you choose. That
used to be my favourite indoor game.       
       Oh!        squealed Vernie,        what an awful suggestion!
In this house!       
       I move we hear the story of the house to-night.       right
now,        said Eve.
Milly clasped her hands over her ears, instead
of, as usual, over her mouth, and cried,        No! I
forbid it! Don       t let        em, will you, Wynne?       
       Seems to me,        remarked Mr. Stebbins,        you
folks don       t know your own minds! You want a
ha       nted house, then when you git it, you       re too
scared to hear the story of the ha       nt.       
       I       m not scared,        asserted Norma,        but somehow,
a ha       nt sounds so much worse than a haunt.
Doesn       t it, now?       
       It sure does,        agreed Braye.        A ha       nt is concrete,
while a haunt is abstract.       
[051]
       Good!        and Hardwick nodded approval.
       Now, I suggest that we look around a bit, get
the general lay of the house and then all go to
bed early. A good night       s sleep will put our nerves
and muscles in condition again. I       m delighted with
the place, and I foresee a first-class vacation ahead
of us.       
       I wish it was behind us, and we were just starting
for home,        murmured Milly, but Eve reprimanded
her.
       Don       t be a spoilsport! I like the place too, Professor,
and I       m going to investigate a little. What
room is this?       
Eve       s graceful figure crossed the great square
hall, where they were all standing about, and paused
at the closed door of a room just at the right hand
as one entered the house.
       Why, it       s locked!        she exclaimed.        That
won       t do, Mr. Stebbins! This whole domain is
ours, now, you know. Open this door, please.       
Eve wore the light gray skirt of her travelling
costume, and a thin sheer white silk blouse, whose
V       d neck fell away from her long, slender throat.
Her hand on the door knob, she suddenly turned her
strange beryl eyes toward Stebbins, her face turning
whiter and her thin lips redder as she gazed.
       This is the room       isn       t it?        she breathed, and
her hand slowly fell from the knob and hung loosely
at her side.
       Yes, ma       am,        replied Stebbins, stolidly.
       How       d you know?       
       How could I help knowing!        and Eve       s voice
rang out like a clarion.        I see it! I see it all!       
[052]
She rushed across the hall and fell trembling on a
settee. Tracy flew to her side, and took her
hand.
       There, there, Miss Carnforth, brace up! We       re
all right here. Nothing can hurt you.       
       Beats all how she knew!        muttered Stebbins.
       You see that       s the room                     
A cry from Milly stirred Landon to action.
       Drop it, Stebbins,        he said, and took a step
toward him.        None of that to-night. We do want
your haunted house, but the long journey up here,
and your confounded negligence in the matter of
lights and servants and general good will, has got
on the ladies        nerves. Beat it now, to the kitchen,
or wherever your quarters are, but you stay here
to-night and be ready to report in the morning.
You hear me?       
       Yes, sir,        and shrugging his shoulders, the man
disappeared among the shadows in the back of the
hall.
The great main hall was so large that the lights
they had were all insufficient for illumination.
There seemed to be innumerable doors and openings
of side corridors, also a second staircase, far behind
the main one.
       Here       s a good-looking room, let       s go in here,       
said Tracy, stepping through some old, faded
draperies to the room on the left of the hall as
one entered the house.
[053]
Hardwick followed, and the others with lamps
and candles pushed in. It was a large, dignified
apartment, evidently a parlour or ballroom of the
old mansion. The furniture was of old, carved
rosewood, its upholstery worn, but fairly decent.
Oil portraits were on the walls and massive ornaments
of imitation bronze stood about, showing
white here and there where the coating was chipped
off.
Yellowish onyx vases graced the mantels, and the
windows were hung with heavy rep curtains which,
however, veiled no lighter ones.
       Ghastly!        cried Norma.
       What do you mean by ghastly?        began the
Professor, and Tracy laughed.
       She didn       t mean it at all, Professor,        he said,
       Miss Cameron meant to say hideous. Now, don       t
ask me what I mean by hideous, just look at the
interior decorations here and draw your own conclusions
as to my meaning. But though not to be
called        sthetic, this furniture is fairly comfy. The
springs of this sofa are intact,       come sit by my side,
little darling.        This last to Vernie, who was wide-eyed
and alert, lapping up these strange, new impressions.
       All right,        and she flung herself down beside
him.        You       re a real comfort, Mr. Tracy,       you       re
so,       so       unministerial!       
       Thank you, my child. One needn       t carry one       s
pulpit voice into social life.       
[054]
       Oh, I don       t mean you do or say anything that
a man of your calling oughtn       t to, but you       re so nice
about it.       
       I think so too,        chattered Milly,        I do think
a clergyman with a sense of humour makes a fine
combination.       
The mental atmosphere gradually lightened and
when Landon suggested they all retire, it was a
composed and merry hearted group that obeyed the
summons.
When twelve sonorous strokes boomed from the
tall clock in the upper hall, the men beneath the roof
of Black Aspens were all sleeping more or less
soundly.
Milly, with only occasional little quivering shudders,
slumbered in Landon       s arms. Vernie slept
with the sound dreamless sleep of youth.
But Eve and Norma were wide awake, and unable
to close their eyes.
In adjoining rooms, the communicating door
ajar, they could hear one another toss restlessly,
but they said no words.
Norma       s blue eyes were wide open, her thoughts
rambling over the strange surroundings in which
she found herself, and her mind leaping forward,
speculating on what might happen.
Eve, her long, glittering eyes half closed, listened
for any sound; her nerves alert, her thoughts darting
from material things to the supernatural, every
muscle tense with a nameless apprehension.
[055]
More hours were rung out by the old clock, and
at last dawn began to creep in at the deep narrow
windows of the old house.
With a shrug and a stretch Vernie awoke.
Drowsily, in the half light she tried to make out
her surroundings, and then, suddenly remembering
where she was, she dove her head under her blanket,
in a quick rush of fear. Then curiosity conquered,
and she came to the surface again, and looked about.
The light, growing gradually stronger, showed the
appointments of the room, the ugly old four-poster
bedstead, of light wood,       apple or hickory,       the
heavy rep lambrequins, that seemed to be a feature
of the house, and the scantily appointed dresser, on
which, the night before, she had set her extinguished
candle.
Shadows still lurked in the corners of the room,
still hung round the draperies and furniture, yet
through the gloom Vernie saw something that made
her eyes stare and her flesh creep. Clenching her
hands till her sharp nails bit into her palms, she gave
a shriek that rang through the silent house.
[056]
CHAPTER IV
The Story of the House
From their nearby rooms Eve and Norma
rushed to Vernie       s room.
The child was huddled beneath the bed
clothes and at their entrance shot her head out, crying
wildly,        Look! look! the old candlestick!       
Milly came running, in dressing-gown and slippers,
and from distant regions came the voices of
the men.
       What       s the matter?        asked Gifford Bruce.
       Wasn       t that Vernie       s voice?       
       Yes, Uncle Gif,        Vernie called out.        Oh, did
you do it?       
       Do what?        and in his hastily donned bath robe,
old Mr. Bruce appeared.
       Why,        and Vernie was calm now,        there       s that
old candlestick, the one the       the murderer used       on
my dresser! Last night I had a little china
one!       
       What are you talking about       a murderer!
Wake up, child!       
       I       m not asleep. But I see, now. You had this
old one, Uncle Gif, and, you know you said you
were going to fool us if you could, and so you
sneaked it in here to pretend the haunt did it!       
[057]
       What! What nonsense! I did nothing of the
sort!       
       Who did, then? You know you had this one
last night.       
       I certainly did. Wonder what       s in my room
now.       
Mr. Bruce ran back to his room and returned
with the little china candlestick Vernie had carried
to her room the night before. They had certainly
been exchanged during the night.
Everybody stared at the two candles, so worthless
in themselves, but so inexplicably transferred, if, as
he declared, Gifford Bruce had not exchanged them.
       Of course I didn       t do it,        he repeated, angrily.
       I did say, in fun, that I meant to trick you, but
when I saw how nervous and wrought up all you
women were last night, I wouldn       t dream of doing
such a thing! Why, Vernie, I think too much of
you, dear, to add to your fear or discomfort in any
way.       
At last everybody concluded it was the work of
some one of their number, and there were varying
opinions as to the identity of the perpetrator of
what must have been meant for a joke.
But at breakfast time the matter was discussed
very seriously and each avowed in all honour that
he or she knew nothing of it.
[058]
       I can speak not only for myself,        said Professor
Hardwick, gravely,        but for Mr. Tracy and
Mr. Braye. They would have had to pass my door
to move around the halls, and I was awake all night,
looking and listening, and I know they did not leave
their rooms.       
       I speak for myself,        said Gifford Bruce,
haughtily.        I declare on my oath that I did not
leave my bed. Somebody exchanged those candles,       but
it was not I.       
The Landons spoke for each other, and no one,
of course, could suspect Wynne or Milly. And
naturally, the two girls, Eve and Norma, would not
go to Mr. Bruce       s room to play a trick like that.
       I don       t mind now,        said Vernie,        when it       s all
light and cheerful and you       re all around me, and the
breakfast is so good and all. I think it       s the beginning
of these experiences we came up here to look
for. Why are you all so surprised? Because I
had the first party?       
The merry-eyed girl was unafraid now, but Hardwick
shook his head.
       I don       t like it,        he said.        We can       t investigate
if there       s a trickster among us. You didn       t do it
yourself, did you, Vernie?       
       No, Professor,        and the pure truthful gaze of
the brown eyes left no room for disbelief.        Honest,
I didn       t. But,        she laughed mischievously,        if
I had, I should say I hadn       t!       
       Vernie! This won       t do!        and Eve glared at
her,        You little minx, I believe you did do it!       
[059]
       Don       t you look at me like that, Eve Carnforth!
Stop it! You scare me.        Vernie fairly cowered
before Eve       s basilisk eyes.        I believe you did it!       
       There, there, girls,        broke in Tracy, with his
gentle smile,        don       t get to hair-pulling. If we       ve
all finished breakfast, let       s now hear the story of the
house, and then we can tell if its patron ghost is
the sort given to exchanging bedroom furniture o       
nights.       
       Yes,        agreed Norma,        I       m crazy to hear the
story. Where       s Mr. Stebbins, does anybody
know?       
       I       ll dig him up,        Landon assured them.
       Where shall we congregate?       
       In the drawing room,        said Milly,        that       s the
only room I       m not afraid of.       
       I       m fearfully afraid of that!        said Tracy, in
mock terror.        Those rep lambrequins get on my
nerves!       
       Aren       t they awful!        and Norma laughed.
       They don       t frighten me, but they jar my        sthetics
terribly.       
       No,        said Elijah Stebbins, firmly, as the conclave
began,        not in that there parlour. Here in
the hall. You folks want this house, you want the
story of this house, now you sit here to hear it.       
       Very well,        said Braye, agreeably.        Just as
you say, Mr. Stebbins. Now begin at the beginning,
but don       t drool too long a spiel.       
[060]
The whole party grouped themselves in the great
hall, and for the first time began to take in the
details of its appointments. Though in disrepair
as to walls and cornices, the lines of its architecture
were fine and it was of noble proportions; the staircase
was beautifully planned; and the wonderful
bronze doors, which they had not examined the
night before, were truly works of art.
       The old Montgomery who brought them doors
from Italy, pretty much built the house behind
       em,        Stebbins volunteered,        and them colyums,
of course, come with the doors. They       re some
valu       ble, I       m told. You see, the doors is the same
outside and in, and the colyums is, too. Well, then,
he had the vestibule of murhoggany, to sort o        set
off the bronze, I s       pose, and the rest of the walls is
marble,       solid old Vermont marble, which Lord
knows was to be had for the pickin       , up here.       
       Get along to the story, Steb,        urged Landon.
       Yes, sir. Well, the Montgomery that built this
house,       though, it was part built before, he added
on to his father       s house,       well, he was a daredevil,
and a tyrant. Little mite of a man, but full of the
old Nick. And, as those little men will do, he
married a reg       lar Hessian of a woman. Big, sort
o        long and gaunt, they say she was, and a termagant
for sure! She led him a life, and also, he
led her one. For he was a terror and so was she.
What he lacked in size he made up in temper, and
she had both. Well, here       s the story.
[061]
       He took sick, and she nursed him. They didn       t
have trained nurses and specialists in them days.
Now some says, he was jest naturally took sick and
some says, that she give him slow poison. But, be
that as it may, one night, she give him prussic acid,
and he died. She threw a shawl over her head,
and ran screamin        to the village for the doctor. I
s       pose remorse got her, for she confessed, and said
       I killed him! I killed him! At four o       clock I
killed him!       
       She went crazy, they say, then and there. Well,
the doctor he said he       d come right away, but she ran
home first. And he followed       s fast       s he could,
and       when he come, here was the woman,       and she
was a washin        the dead man       s lips,       she said, to get
the smell of the bitter ammonds off,       you know,
prussic acid is for all the world the smell of bitter
almonds. The doctor, he found the man was
really dead, and he was for havin        her arrested, but
she was so plumb crazy, he decided to take her to
an asylum instead.
       He had to go off to get help, and he left her,       here
alone in this house with the body. They was
in that room,        Stebbins pointed to the room with the
locked door, at the right hand of the hall as one
entered,        the room with the tassels, it       s called.       
       Why is it called that?        broke in Eve, whose
piercing eyes were fairly glittering with excitement,
       what sort of tassels?       
       Great heavy tassels on the curtains and lambaquins,
ma       am,       want to see it?       
       Not now,        ordained Landon,        the story first.       
[062]
       Well,        resumed Stebbins,        they was in that
room, the dead husband and the live wife, when the
doctor went away, and because he knew she was
out of her head, he locked        em in. And when he
came back       she was setting there, just where he       d
left her, still in a dazed sort o        stupor, and       the
corpse was gone.       
       Gone! where?        rasped out the Professor.
       Nobody knows. Nobody ever knew. It had
just disappeared from off the face of the earth.
The doctor and the village folks all agreed that it
was sperrited away.        Cause that woman,       she
couldn       t get out o        the doors to cart it off, and she
couldn       t        a        got out of a winder with it, without
showin        some signs, and if she had, what in the
world could she        a        done with it? It wasn       t buried
nowhere around, and if she       d        a        threw it in the
lake, s       posin        she       d got out a winder, how       d she
got in again? Anyhow, that       s the story, and they
all said she was a witch and she bewitched the body
away, so       s the doctor and sheriff couldn       t smell the
prussic acid on it and hang her for murder. They
searched and searched but they couldn       t find no
signs of her havin        even moved outen her chair.
She sat there like a dead woman herself, when the
doctor left her and likewise when he come back.       
       The tale is very circumstantial,        observed Gifford
Bruce, a bit drily.
[063]
       I       m tellin        it as I       ve many a time heard it, sir,       
said Stebbins, a little resentfully.        This here
story       s been common talk around these parts a
many years, and I ain       t one to add to nor take
from it.       
       Go on,        commanded Landon, briefly.
       They put her away, in a loonytic asylum, and
she died in it. They never found hide nor hair of
the dead man, and the place fell to some kin that
lived down Pennsylvania way. They come up here
for a while, I b       lieve, but the ha       nt scared        em off.
It       s been sold some several times and at last it fell
to my father       s family. Now it       s mine, and it       s a
white elephant to me. I can       t sell or rent it, and
so you folks may well believe I jumped at the chance
to have you take it for a spell.       
       We haven       t heard about the haunt yet,        said
Norma. She spoke quietly, but her lips quivered a
little, and her fingers were nervously picking at her
handkerchief.
       That,        and Stebbins looked even more sombre
than he had,        that       s my own experience, so I can
give it to you first hand.
       I come here to live,        bout ten years ago, and I
was plucky enough to hoot at ghost stories and tales
o        ha       nts.
       So I set out to sleep in that       that room with the
tassels,       out o        sheer bravado. But I got enough
of it.       
The man       s head fell on his breast and he paused
in his narrative.
       Go on,        said Landon, less brusquely than before.
[064]
Milly stirred nervously.        Don       t let him tell the
rest, Wynne,        she said.
       Oh, yes, dear. Remember, this is what we       re
here for.       
Most of the men shifted their positions; Hardwick
leaned forward, both hands on his knees. Gifford
Bruce sat with one arm flung carelessly over
his chair back, a slight smile on his face.
Braye was beside Norma, and watched alternately
her face and Eve       s, while Tracy was holding
Vernie       s hand, and his gentle calm kept the volatile
child quiet.
       I see it all so plainly,       that first night                     
Stebbins said, slowly.        First night! Land! there
never was another! Not for me. I       d sooner        a       
died than slep        in that room again!       
       See a ghost?        asked Bruce, flippantly.
       Yes, sir,        and Stebbins looked straight at him.
       I seen a ghost. I       m a sound sleeper, I am, and I
went to sleep quiet and ca       m as a baby. I woke as
the big clock there was a strikin        four. It was that
what woke me       I hope.       
       Is there       is there a bed in that room?        asked
the Professor.
       Lord, yes, it was them folkses bedroom. In
them days, people most always slep        downstairs. I
come awake suddenly, and the room was full of an
icy chill. Not just coldness, but a damp chill       like
undertakers        iceboxes.       
[065]
Vernie shuddered and Tracy held her hand more
firmly. Landon slipped his arm round Milly, and
Eve and Norma glanced at each other.
Gifford Bruce replaced his sneering smile, which
had somehow disappeared.
       It was winter, and plumb dark at four o       clock
in the morning, but the room was full of an unearthly
light,       a sort of frosty, white glow, like you
see in a graveyard sometimes.
       And comin        toward me was a tall, gaunt figure,
with a shawl over its head, a white, misty shape,
that had a sort of a halting step but was comin       
straight and sure toward that bed I was lyin        on. I
tried to scream, I tried to move, but I couldn       t,       I
was paralyzed. On and on came the thing       halting
at every step, but gettin        nearer and nearer.
As she       oh, I knew it was that woman                     
       I thought it was a man who was murdered,       
put in Mr. Bruce, in his most sardonic
tones.
       So it was, sir,        Stebbins spoke mildly,        but it
was the murderess doin        the ha       ntin       . I s       pose she
can       t rest quiet in her grave for remorse and
that. She came nearer and       and I saw her face       and                     
       Well?       
       And it was a skull! A grinning skull. And
her long bony hand held a glass       a glass of poison       for
me.       
       Er       did you take it?        This from Bruce.
[066]
       No, sir. I swooned away, or whatever you may
call it. I lost all consciousness, and when I come
to, the thing was gone.       
       Ever see her again?        inquired Mr. Bruce, conversationally.
       No, sir,        and Stebbins eyed him uninterestedly.
It was impossible to annoy the story teller.        No,
I never seen her.       
       Heard her?        asked Braye.
       Yes; many       s the time. But       I ain       t never slept
in that room since.       
       I should say not!        cried Eve.        But I will!
I       ll brave the phantasm. I       d be glad to see her.
I       m not afraid.       
       You needn       t be,        said Mr. Bruce, with a short
laugh.        You won       t see anything, Miss Carnforth.
I       d be willing to try it, too.       
       What other manifestations have you experienced?       
asked Braye.        What have you heard?       
       Mostly groans                     
       And hollow laughter,        interrupted Bruce.
       Those are the regulation sounds, I believe.       
       Oh, hush!        cried Eve.        Mr. Bruce, you drive
me frantic! I wish you hadn       t come!       
       I don       t,        declared Bruce.        I think it       s most
interesting. And do I understand, Mr. Stebbins,
that this charming lady of large size and hard heart,
carried usually that candlestick that I made use of
last night?       
At last Stebbins resented Bruce       s chaff.
[067]
       So the story goes, sir,        he said, curtly.        And
many       s the time I       ve known that candlestick to be
moved during the night, by no mortal hand.       
       Look here, Uncle Gif,        said Braye, good-naturedly,
       you don       t want to get yourself disliked,
do you? Now, let up on your quizzing, and
let       s get down to business. We set out for a
haunted house. I, for one, think we       ve got all we
came after, and then some! If the ha       nt began
moving her candlestick around the first night, what
may she not do next? You didn       t do it, did you,
Uncle?       
       I       ve told you I didn       t, Rudolph, and I again
repeat my word. But it was scarcely necessary for
me to do it, when such a capable spook,       I mean,
phantasm is regularly in attendance.       
       Now, I       ve told you the tale,        and Stebbins rose,
and shook himself as if he had done his duty.        I
ain       t nowise responsible for your believin        it. What
I       ve told you is true, so far       s my own experience
goes; and what I       ve told you hearsay, is the old
story that       s been told up in these parts by one generation
after another, since old Montgomery       s day.
Now do you want to see the room with the tassels?       
       I don       t!        cried Milly,        I can       t stand any more.       
       You needn       t, dear,        said Landon;        suppose you
go out on the terrace and walk about in the sunlight.
You go with her, Vernie, you can see the room,
later on.       
       I       ll go too,        and Tracy tactfully offered his escort.
       The tassels will keep. Come on, Braye?       
[068]
       No; I       ll see the show through. You can look
after the ladies, Tracy.       
So the others crowded round Stebbins, as he prepared
to unlock the door of the fatal room.
              Tain       t no great sight,        he said, almost apologetically.
       But it       s the ha       nted room.       
Slowly he turned the key and they all filed in.
The room was dark, save for what light came in
from the hall. All blinds were closed, and over
the windows hung heavy curtains of rep that had
once been red but was now a dull, nondescript
colour. There were more of these heavy, long curtains,
evidently concealing alcoves or cupboards,
and over each curtain was a        lambrequin        edged
with thick twisted woolen fringe, and at intervals,
tassels,       enormous, weighty tassels, such as were
once used in church pulpits and other old-fashioned
upholstery. Such quantities of these there were,
that it is small wonder the room received its name.
And the tassels had a sinister air. Motionless
they hung, dingy, faded, but still of an individuality
that seemed to say,        we have seen unholy deed,       we
cry out mutely for vengeance!       
       It was them tassels that scared me most,        Stebbins
said, in an awed tone.        I mean before       she
come. They sort of swayed,       when they wasn       t no
draught nor anything.       
       I don       t wonder!        said Braye,        they       re the
ghostliest things I ever saw! But the whole room
is awful! It       oh I say! put up a window!       
[069]
       I can       t,        said Stebbins simply.        These here
windows ain       t been up for years and years. The
springs is all rusted and won       t work.       
       There       s something in the room!        cried Eve,
hysterically,        I mean       something       besides us       something
alive!       
       No, ma       am,        said Stebbins, solemnly,        what       s
in here ain       t alive, ma       am. I ain       t been in here myself,
since that night I slep        here, and I wouldn       t be
now, only to show you folks the room. I sort of
feel        s if I       d shifted the responsibility to you folks
now. I don       t seem to feel the same fear of the
ha       nt, like I was here alone.       
       Don       t say ha       nt! Stop it!        and Eve almost
shrieked at him.
       Yes, ma       am. Ghost, ma       am. But ha       nt it is,
and ha       nt it will be, till the crack o        doom. Air ye
all satisfied with your bargain?       
No one answered, for every one was conscious of
a subtle presence and each glanced fearfully, furtively
about, nerves shaken, wills enfeebled, vitality
low.
       What is it?        whispered Eve.
       Imagination!        declared Mr. Bruce, but he
shook his shoulders as he spoke, as if ridding himself
of an incubus.
There was a chilliness that was not like honest
cold, there was a stillness that was not an ordinary
silence, and there was an impelling desire in every
heart to get out of that room and never return.
[070]
But all were game, and when at last Stebbins said,
       Seen enough?        they almost tumbled over one another
in a burst of relief at the thought of exit.
The great hall seemed cheerful by contrast, and
Landon, in a voice he strove to make matter-of-fact,
said,        Thank you, Stebbins, you have certainly
given us what we asked for.       
       Yes, sir. Did you notice it, sir?       
       What?       
       The smell       the odour       in that room?       
       I did,        said Eve,        I noticed the odour of
prussic acid.       
       Yes, ma       am,        said Stebbins,        that       s what I
meant.       
[071]
CHAPTER V
Eve       s Experience
The investigators had investigated for a week.
They were now having tea in the great hall,
to whose shadowy distances and shabby appointments
they had become somewhat accustomed.
Kept up to the mark by the Landons, old Jed
Thorpe had developed positive talents as a butler,
and with plenty of lamps and candles, and a couple
of willing, if ignorant maids, the household machinery
ran fairly smoothly. Supplies were procured in
East Dryden or sent up from New York markets
and by day the party was usually a gay-hearted,
merry-mannered country house group.
Every day at tea-time, they recounted any individual
experiences that might seem mysterious, and
discussed them.
       It       s this way,        Professor Hardwick summed
up;        the determining factor is the dark. Ghosts
and haunted houses are all very well at night, but
daylight dispels them as a sound breaks silence.       
       What about my experience when I slept in the
Room with the Tassels,        growled Gifford Bruce.
Braye laughed.        You queered yourself, Uncle
Gif, when you announced before we started, that
you were not bound to good faith. Your ghost
stories are discounted before you tell        em!       
[072]
       But I did see a shape,       a shadowy form, like a
tall woman with a shawl over her head                     
       You dreamed it,        said Milly, smiling at him.
       Or else                     
       Milly daren       t say it,        laughed Eve,        but I will.
Or else, you invented the yarn.       
       If I       m to be called a                     
       Tut, tut, Mr. Bruce,        intervened Tracy,        nobody
called you one! Playful prevarication is all
right, especially as you warned us you       d fool us if
you could. Now I can tell an experience and justly
expect to be believed.       
       But you haven       t had any,        and Eve       s translucent
eyes turned to him.
       I have,        began Tracy, slowly,        but they       ve been
a bit indefinite. It       s unsatisfactory to present only
an impression or a suggestion, where facts are
wanted. And the Professor says truly that hints
and haunts are convincing at night, but repeated, at
a pleasant, comfortable tea hour, they sound flimsy
and unconvincing.       
       What did you think you saw or heard?        asked
Norma, with a reminiscent, far-off look in her eyes.
       Every morning, or almost every morning, at
four o       clock, I seem to hear the trailing robes of a
presence of some sort. I seem to hear a faint moaning
sound, that is like nothing human.       
       That       s imagination,        said Braye, promptly.
[073]
       It is, doubtless,        agreed Hardwick,        but it is
due to what may be called        expectant attention.        If
we had not connected four o       clock with the story of
this house, Mr. Tracy would not have those hallucinations
at that time.       
       Perhaps so,        the clergyman looked thoughtful.
       But it seems vivid and real at the time. Then, in
the later morning, it is merely a hazy memory.       
       You know Mr. Stebbins said that every one
who died in this house always died at four
o       clock.       
       I know he said so,        and Braye looked quizzical.
       Oh, come now, don       t doubt honest old Stebbins!       
and Eve frowned.        We must believe his
tales or we       ll never get anywhere. I       m going over
to East Dryden to see him to-morrow, I want a few
more details. And, it seems to me, we       re getting
nowhere,       with our imaginations and hallucinations.
Now, to-night, I       m going to sleep in the
Room with the Tassels. I       ve no fear of it, and I
have a deep and great curiosity.       
       Oh, let me sleep there with you! Mayn       t I,
Eve? Oh, please let me!        Vernie danced about
in her eagerness, and knelt before Eve, pleading.
       No, Vernie, I forbid it,        said her uncle, decidedly.
       If Miss Carnforth wants to do this
thing, I have nothing to say, but you must not, my
child. I know you people don       t believe me, but
I surely saw an apparition the night I slept there,
and it was no human trickster. Neither was it hallucination.
I was as wideawake as I am now                     
[074]
       We know the rest, Uncle Gif,        and Braye
laughingly interrupted the recital.        Stalking ghost,
hollow groans, and       were there clanking chains?       
       There were not, but in its shrouded hand the
spectre held a glass                     
       Of prussic acid, of which you smelt the strong
odour! Yes, I know,       but it won       t go down, old
chap                     
       The prussic acid won       t?        and Landon chuckled.
       Nor the tale either,        said the Professor.        It       s
too true. The shawled woman filled the specifications
too accurately to seem convincing.       
       You       re a nice crowd,        grumbled Mr. Bruce.
       Come up here for experiences and then hoot at
the first real thing that happens.       
       All your own fault,        retorted Norma.        If you
hadn       t advertised your propensity for fooling us,
your word would have carried weight.       
       All right, let somebody else sleep in that room,
then. But not Miss Carnforth. Let one of the
men try it.       
       Thank you, none for me,        said Braye.        I detest
shawled women waking me up at four o       clock,
to take my poison!       
       I       ll beg off, too,        said Tracy.        I wake at four
every morning anyway, with those aspen boughs
shivering against my windows. I       d trim them off,
but that doesn       t seem like playing the game.       
       Wynne shan       t sleep there, and that settles that,       
and Milly       s grasp on her husband       s coat sleeve was
evidently sufficiently detaining.
[075]
       That leaves only me, of the men,        asserted the
Professor.        I       m quite willing to sleep in that
room. Indeed, I want to. I       ve only been waiting
till I felt sure of the house, the servants and       excuse
me, the members of our own party! Now,
I       ve discovered that the servants        quarters can be
securely locked off, so that they cannot get in this
part of the house; I       ve found that the outside doors
and the windows can be fastened against all possibility
of outside intrusion; and, I shall stipulate that
our party shall so congregate in a few rooms, that
no one can       ahem,       haunt my slumbers without
some one else knowing it. I       ll ask you three young
ladies to sleep in one room and allow me to lock
you in. Or two adjoining rooms, to which I may
hold all keys. Mr. Tracy, Mr. Bruce and Mr.
Braye, I shall arrange similarly, while the Landons
must also consent to be imprisoned by me. This
is the only way I can make a fair test. Will you
all agree?       
       Splendid!        cried Eve,        of course we will. But,
Professor, let me try it first. If you should have a
weird experience, it might scare me off, but now I
am brave enough. Oh, please, do that! Let me
lock you all in your rooms, and let me sleep in the
Room with the Tassels to-night! Oh, please say
yes, all of you! I must, I must try it!        The girl
looked like a seeress, as, with glittering eyes and
flushed cheeks she plead her cause.
[076]
       Why, of course, if you want to, Miss Carnforth,       
said the Professor, looking at her admiringly.
       I       ll be glad to have the benefit of your
experience before testing myself. And there is
positively no danger. As I       ve said, the locks, bolts,
and bars are absolutely safe against outside intrusion,
or visits from the servants. Though we know
they are not to be suspected. And as you are not
afraid of the supernatural, I can see no argument
against your plan.       
       Suppose I go with you,        suggested Norma, her
large blue eyes questioning Eve Carnforth       s excited
face.
       No, Norma, not this time. I prefer to be alone.
I       ll lock you and Vernie in your room; I       ll lock
Milly and Wynne in their room; I       ll lock you four
men in two rooms, and then, I       ll know       I       ll know
that whatever I see or hear is not a fraud or trick
of anybody. And I think you can trust me to tell
you the truth in the morning.       
       If there       s anything to tell,        supplemented
Braye.        I think, Eve, as to ghosts, you       re cutting
off your source of supply.       
       Then we       ll merely prove nothing. But I       m determined
to try.       
Again Vernie begged to be allowed to share Eve       s
experiences, but neither Mr. Bruce, nor Eve herself
would consider the child       s request.
[077]
       Every one of us,        the Professor said, musingly,
       has told of hearing mysterious sounds and of seeing
mysterious shadows, but,       except for Bruce       s
graphic details!       all our observations have been
vague and uncertain. They may well have been
merely imagination. But Miss Carnforth is not
imaginative, I mean, not so, to the exclusion of a
fair judgment of what her senses experience.
Therefore I shall feel, if she sees nothing to-night,
that I shall see nothing when I sleep in that room
to-morrow night.       
       I am especially well adapted for the test,        Eve
said, though in no way proudly,        for I have a premonition
that the phantasm will appear to me more
readily than to some others. Remember, I knew
that was the haunted room before we had been told.
I knew it before we entered the house that first
night. It was revealed to me, as other things have
been even during our stay here. You must realize
that I am a sensitive, and so better fitted for these
visitations than a more phlegmatic or practical
person.       
       What else has been revealed to you, Eve?       
asked Braye.
       Perhaps revealed isn       t just the word, Rudolph,
but I       ve seen more than most of you, I       ve heard
voices, rustling as of wings, and other inexplicable
sounds, that I know were audible only to
me.       
       Lord, Eve, you give me the creeps! Finished
your tea? Come out for a walk then. Let       s
get off these subjects, if only for half an
hour.       
[078]
That night, Eve Carnforth carried out her plans
to the letter.
Gifford Bruce, and his nephew Braye in one
room; the Professor and Tracy in another, were
locked in by Eve, amid much gaiety of ceremony.
       Set a thief to catch a thief,        Braye declared.
       Tracy, look after the Professor, that he doesn       t
jump out of the window, and you, Professor, watch
Tracy!       
       They can       t jump out the windows,        said Eve,
practically,        they       re too high. And if they could,
they couldn       t get in the tasseled room. Those
windows won       t open. And, too, I know the Professor
won       t let Mr. Tracy out of his sight, or vice
versa. Rudolph, you tie your uncle, if he shows
signs of roving.       
Eve       s strong nerves gave no sign of tension as
she completed all her precautionary arrangements.
She locked the doors that shut off the servants       
quarters; she locked the Landons in their room, she
locked the door of the room that Norma and Vernie
occupied, and at last, with various gay messages
shouted at her through the closed portals, she went
downstairs to keep her lonely vigil.
She did not undress, for she had no intention of
sleeping that night. A kimono, and her hair comfortably
in a long braid were her only concessions
to relaxation.
[079]
She lay down on the hard old bed, and gazed
about her. A single lamp lit the room, and she had
a candle also, in case she desired to use it.
The light made strange shadows, the heavy, faded
hangings seemed to sway and move, but whether
they really did so or not, Eve couldn       t determine.
She got up and went to examine them. The feel of
them was damp and unpleasant, they seemed to
squirm under her hand, and she hastily dropped
them and returned to the bed.
There was an uncanny, creepy atmosphere that
disturbed her, in spite of her strong nerves and indomitable
will.
She had locked the door, now she arose and took
the key out and laid it on a table. She had heard
that a key in a lock could be turned from the other
side.
Then, on a sudden impulse, she put out the lamp,
feeling utter darkness preferable to those weird
shadows. But the darkness was too horrible, so she
lighted the candle. It was not in the historic old
brass candlestick, but in a gay affair of red china,
and the homely, cheap thing somewhat reassured
her, as a bit of modernity and real life.
She listened for a long time, imagining sighs or
sounds, which she could not be sure she really heard.
The whispering aspens outside were audible, and
their continued soughing was monotonously annoying,
but not frightful, because she had accustomed
herself to it.
[080]
At last, her over-wrought nerves wearied, her
physical nature refused further strain, and Eve slept.
A light, fitful sleep, interspersed with waking moments
and with sudden swift dreams. But she kept
fast hold of her perceptive faculties. If she slept
and woke, she knew it. She heard the aspens       
sounds, the hours struck by the great hall clock, and
the sound of her own quick, short breathing.
Nothing else.
Until, just as the clock tolled the last stroke of
four, she heard a low grating sound. Was some
one at the door? She was glad she had taken out
the key.
The candle still burned, but its tiny light rather
accentuated than lifted the gloom of the shadowy
room.
Slowly and noiselessly the door swung open, inward,
into the room. Eve tried to sit up in bed,
but could not. She felt paralyzed, not so much
frightened, as numbed with physical dread.
And then, with a slow gliding motion, something
entered,       something tall, gaunt and robed in long,
pale-coloured draperies. It was unreal, shadowy in
its aspect, it was only dimly visible in the gloom, but
it gave the impression of a frightened, furtive personality
that hesitated to move, yet was impelled to.
A soft moan, as of despair, came from the figure,
and it put out a long white hand and pinched out
the candle flame. Then, with another sigh, Eve
could feel, in the utter black darkness that the thing
was coming to her side.
[081]
With all her might she tried to cry out, but her
vocal cords were dumb, she made no sound. But
she felt,       with all her senses, she felt the apparition
draw nearer. At her bedside it paused, she knew
this, by a sort of sixth sense, for she heard or saw
nothing.
Then, she was conscious of a faint odour of
prussic acid, its pungent bitterness unmistakable,
though slight.
And then, a tiny flame, as of a wick without a
candle, flashed for a second, disappeared, and Eve
almost fainted. She did not entirely lose consciousness,
but her brain reeled, her head seemed to
spin round and her ears rang with a strange buzzing,
for in the instant       s gleam of that weird light,
she had seen the face of the phantom, and       it was
the face of a skull! It was the ghastly countenance
of a death       s head!
Half conscious, but listening with abnormal sense,
she thought she descried the closing of the door, but
could hear no key turn.
The knowledge that she was alone, gave her new
life. She sprang up, lighted the candle, lighted
the lamp, and looked about. All was as she had
arranged it. The door was locked, the key, untouched,
upon the table. Nothing was disturbed,
but Eve Carnforth knew that her experience, whatever
its explanation, had not been a dream.
[082]
When her senses had reeled, she had not lost
entire control of them through her physical fear, she
had kept her mental balance, and she knew that
what her brain had registered had actually occurred.
Alert, she lay for a long time thinking it over.
She felt sure there would be no return of the
spectre,       she felt sure it had been a spectre,       and
she was conscious of a feeling of curiosity rather
than fright.
At last she rose, and unlocking the door, went
out into the great hall. By the light of her lamp,
she looked it over. The carved bronze doors between
the enormous bronze columns, were so elaborately
locked and bolted as to give almost the
effect of a fortress.
The windows were fastened and some were
barred. But all these details had been looked after
in advance; Eve gazed at them now, in an idle quest
for some hint of hitherto unsuspected ingress.
But there was none, and now the clock was striking
five.
She went slowly upstairs, unlocked the various
doors, without opening them, and then went to her
own bedroom.
       What about it?        cried Norma, eagerly, running
to Eve       s room.
       A big story,        Eve returned, wearily.        But I       ll
tell it to you all at once. I       m going to get some
sleep. Wake me at eight, will you, Norma?       
Disappointed, but helpless, as Eve closed her door
upon the would-be visitor, Norma went back and
told Milly, who was waiting and listening.
[083]
       I don       t like it,        Norma said,        for by eight
o       clock she can cook up a story to scare us all! I
think two ought to sleep in that room at once.       
       Go to bed,        said Milly, sleepily.        And don       t
you suspect Eve Carnforth of making up a yarn or
even dressing up the truth! She isn       t that sort.       
As to Eve       s veracity, opinions were divided.
She told the whole story, directly after breakfast,
to the whole group, the servants being well out of
earshot.
She told it simply and straightforwardly, just as
it had happened to her. Her sincerity and accurate
statements stood a fire of questions, a volley of sarcastic
comments and a few assertions of unbelief.
Professor Hardwick believed implicitly all she
said, and encouraged her to dilate upon her experiences.
But in nowise did she add to them, she
merely repeated or emphasized the various points
without deviation from her first narrative.
Norma and Braye went for a walk, and frankly
discussed it.
       Of course, Eve colours it without meaning to,       
declared Braye;        it couldn       t have happened, you
know. We were all locked in, and Lord knows
none of us could have put that stunt over even if
we had wanted to.       
       Of course not; that locking in business was
unnecessary, but it does prove that no human agency
was at work. That leaves only Eve       s imagination       or       the
real thing.       
[084]
       It wasn       t the real thing,        and Braye shook his
head.        There ain       t no such animal! But Eve       s
imagination is                     
       No. Mr. Braye, you       re on the wrong tack.
Eve       s imagination is not the sort that conjures up
phantoms. Vernie       s might do that, or Mrs. Landon       s,       but
not Miss Carnforth       s. She is psychic,       I
know, because I am myself                     
       Miss Cameron,       Norma,                      and Braye became
suddenly insistent,        don       t you sleep in that
infernal room, will you? Promise me you won       t.       
       Why?        and the big blue eyes looked at him
in surprise.        As Sentimental Tommy used to say,
       I would fell like to!        Why shouldn       t I?       
       Oh, I don       t want you to,        and Braye looked
really distressed.        Promise me you won       t       please.       
       Why do you care?        Fraid I       ll be carried off by
the Shawled Woman?       
       Ugh!        and Braye shivered.        I can       t bear to
think of you alone down there. I beg of you not
to do it.       
       But that       s what we came for. We       re to investigate,
you know.       
       Well, then promise you won       t try it until after
I do.       
       Trickster! And if you never try it, I can       t!       
       You see through me too well. But, at least,
promise this. If you try it, don       t go alone. Say,
you and Miss Carnforth go together                     
[085]
       Hello, people,        and Vernie ran round a corner,
followed more slowly by Tracy.        We       ve had a
great little old climb! Hundreds of thousands of
feet up the mounting side,       wasn       t it, Mr. Tracy?       
       Thar or tharabouts,        agreed Tracy, smiling at
the pretty child.
       And Mr. Tracy is the delightfullest man! He
told me all the names of the wild flowers,       weeds,
rather,       there weren       t any flowers. And oh, isn       t
it exciting about Eve       s ghost! I       m going to ballyrag
Uncle Gif till he lets me sleep in that room.
He       ll have to give in at last!       
       Don       t, Vernie,        begged Braye.        What possesses
all you girls! I wish we       d never started this
racket! But you mustn       t do it, Kiddie, unless, that
is, you go with somebody else. But not alone.       
       Why, Cousin Rudolph, what are you afraid of?
Are you a mollycoddle?       
       No, child, I       m afraid for you. A shock like
that, even an imaginary fright, might upset your
reason and                     
       Fiddle-de-dee! my reason is deeper rooted than
that! Come on, Mr. Tracy, I       ll race you to that
big hemlock tree!       
The two started off, Vernie       s flying legs gaining
ground at first, over Tracy       s steady well-trained
running step.
[086]
CHAPTER VI
At Four o       Clock
The game grew more absorbing. Most of
the party managed to store up enough courage
by day to last well into the darker and
more mysterious hours. It was at four in the morning
that manifestations were oftenest noticed. At
that hour vague moanings and rustlings were reported
by one or another of the interested investigators,
but no human agency was found to account
for these.
Many plans were tried for discovering the secret
of the Room with the Tassels, but all scrutiny failed
to show any secret panel or concealed entrance.
Indeed, their measurings and soundings proved
there could not possibly be any entrance to that
room save the door from the hall.
Eve and Norma believed thoroughly in the actual
haunt of the woman who had poisoned her husband.
They had no difficulty in swallowing whole all the
strange noises or sights and attributing them to
supernatural causes.
Not so Gifford Bruce. He still held that it was
all trickery, cleverly done by some of the party, but
as this was so clearly impossible, his opinion carried
no weight.
[087]
Professor Hardwick was open-minded, but exceedingly
alert of observation and ready to suspect
anybody who would give him the slightest reason to
do so. Nobody did, however, and the weird sounds
continued at intervals. The other men were noncommittal,
saying they hadn       t yet sufficient data to
base conclusions on.
Milly was nervous and hysterical, but controlled
her feelings at Landon       s plea, and awaited developments
with the rest. Vernie was merely an excited
child, gay with youthful spirits and ready to believe
or disbelieve whatever the others did.
Soon after Eve       s experience, which no one, unless
Gifford Bruce, doubted, Professor Hardwick slept
in the haunted room. He had no results of interest
to report. He said he had lain awake for a few
hours and then fell asleep not to waken until daylight.
If the Shawled Woman prowled about, he
did not see or hear her. This was disappointing,
but Tracy tried with little better success. In the
morning, after a wakeful but uneventful night, the
clergyman found the old battered brass candlestick
in the room.
It had not been there the night before, and he
had locked the door as the others had done. This
was inexplicable, but of slight interest compared to
a real haunting.
       You might have made up a ghost story,        Braye
reproached him,        as Uncle Gifford did, and as Miss
Carnforth       didn       t!       
[088]
The last word was distinctly teasing and Eve
frowned gaily at him, but did not defend herself.
She knew her experience had occurred
just as she had told it, and, deeply mystified,
she was earnestly and eagerly awaiting more
light.
One day Braye found it necessary to go down
to New York for a couple of days on some business
matters. Before leaving, he made Vernie promise
she would not sleep alone in the haunted room while
he was gone.
       I forbid it, child,        he said.        Uncle Gif is so
easy-going that I       ve no doubt you could wheedle
permission out of him, but I beg of you not to.
You       re too young to risk a nerve shock of that sort.
If you want to try it with Miss Carnforth or Miss
Cameron, all right, but not alone. Promise me,
Flapper, and I       ll bring you a pretty present from
town day after to-morrow.       
Vernie laughingly gave the required promise, but
it did not weigh heavily on her conscience, for no
sooner had Braye really gone, than she confided to
Mr. Tracy her indecision regarding the keeping of
her word.
       Of course you       ll keep your promise,        and Tracy
regarded her seriously.        Nice people consider a
spoken word inviolable. I know you, Vernie; you
like to talk at random, but I think you       ve an honourable
nature.       
[089]
So Vernie said nothing more to him, but she confided
in Eve Carnforth her intention of sleeping in
the Tasseled Room that very night.
Eve did not discourage her, and promised to tell
no one.
The plan was easily carried out. As it was
understood no one was sleeping in the haunted
room, no special precautions were taken, save the
usual locking up against outside intruders. And
after the great locks and bolts were fastened on
doors and windows, it would have been a clever
burglar indeed who could have effected an entrance
to Black Aspens.
The evening had been pleasantly spent. Some
trials of the Ouija board, a favourite diversion, had
produced no interesting results, and rather early
they all retired.
At midnight, Vernie softly rose, and went downstairs
alone in the darkness. A night lamp in the
upper hall gave a faint glimmer below stairs, but
after the girl turned into the great hall the dark
was almost impenetrable.
Feeling her way, she came to the door of the
room, softly entered it and walked in. Passing her
hands along the walls and the familiar furnishings
she found the bed and lay down upon it. Her heart
beat fast with excitement but not with fear. She
felt thrills of hope that the ghost would appear and
thrills of apprehension lest it should!
[090]
She had left the door to the hall open, and though
it could scarcely be called light, there was a mitigation
of the darkness near the door. A not unpleasant
drowsiness overcame her, and she half
slept, waking every time the clock struck in the
hall.
At three, she smiled to herself, realizing that she
was there, in the Room with the Tassels, and felt
no fear.        I hope something comes at four,                     
she thought sleepily, and closed her eyes again.
One       two       three       four       boomed the hall clock.
Vernie opened her eyes, only half conscious, and
yet able to discern a strange chill in the air. Between
her and the open door stood a tall gaunt
shape, merely a shadow, for it was too dark to
discern details. Her calm forsook her; she shivered
violently, unable to control her muscles. Her
teeth chattered, her knees knocked together, and
her hair seemed to rise from her head.
Yet she could make no sound. Vainly she tried
to scream, to shriek,       but her dry throat was constricted
as with an iron band.
Her eyes burned in their sockets, yet she was
powerless to shut them. They seemed suddenly to
possess an uncanny ability to pierce the darkness,
and she saw the shape draw slowly nearer to her.
[091]
Clutching the bedclothing, she tried to draw it
over her head, but her paralyzed arms refused to
move. Nearer, slowly nearer, the thing came, and
horror reached its climax at sight of the face beneath
the sheltering shawl. It was the face of a
skull! The hollow eye-sockets glared at her, and
lifting a deathlike hand, with long white fingers,
the spectre told off one, two, three, four! on the
digits. There was no sound, but a final pointing
of the fearsome index finger at the stricken girl,
seemed a death warrant for herself.
The thing disappeared. Slowly, silently, as it
had come, so it went. From nowhere to nowhere,       it
evolved from the darkness and to the darkness
returned.
Vernie didn       t faint, but she suffered excruciatingly;
her head was on fire, her flesh crept and
quivered, she was bathed in a cold perspiration, and
her heart beat madly, wildly, as if it would burst.
The vision, though gone, remained etched on her
brain, and she knew that until that faded she could
not move or speak.
It seemed to her hours, but at last the tension
lessened a little. The first move was agony, but
by degrees she changed her position a trifle and
moistened her dry lips.
With the first faint glimmer of dawn, she dragged
herself upstairs and crept into bed beside Eve Carnforth.
       Tell me,        begged Eve, and Vernie told her.
       It was a warning,        said the child, solemnly.
       It means I shall die at four o       clock some morning.       
       Nonsense, Kiddie! Now you       ve come through
so bravely, and have such an experience to tell, don       t
spoil it all by such croaking.       
[092]
       But it       s true, Eve. I could see that awful
thing       s face, and it counted four, and then beckoned,       sort
of shook its finger, you know, and pointed
at me. And       oh, I hardly noticed at the time, but
it carried a glass in its hand       it seemed to have two
glasses                     
       Oh, come now, dearie, you       re romancing. How
could it have two glasses, when it was shaking its
hand at you?       
       But it did, Eve. It had two little glasses, both
in the same hand. I remember distinctly. Oh,
every bit of it is printed on my brain forever! I
wish I hadn       t done it! Rudolph told me not to!       
A flood of tears came and Vernie gave way to
great racking sobs, as she buried her face in the
pillow.
       Yes, he was right, too, Vernie; but you know,
he only wanted you not to try it because he feared
it would upset your nerves. Now if you       re going
to square yourself with Mr. Braye, you can only do
it, by not letting your nerves be upset. So brace up
and control them. Cry, dear, cry all you can.
That       s a relief, and will do you a heap of good.
Then we       ll talk it over, and by breakfast time you       ll
be ready to tell them all about it, and you       ll be the
heroine of the whole crowd. It       s wonderful,
Vernie, what you       ve got to tell, and you must be
careful to tell it truly and not exaggerate or forget
anything. Cry away, honey, here       s a fresh handkerchief.       
[093]
Eve       s calm voice and matter-of-fact manner did
much to restore Vernie       s nerves, and as she looked
around the rational, familiar room, bright with sunlight,
her spirits revived, and she began to appreciate
her r       le of heroine.
Her story was received with grave consideration.
It was impossible to believe the honest, earnest child
capable of falsehood or deceit. Her description
was too realistic, her straightforward narrative too
unshakable, her manner too impressively true, to be
doubted in the least degree or detail.
Gifford Bruce laughed and complimented her on
her pluck. Mr. Tracy reproved her for breaking
her word to her cousin, but as he was in no way
responsible for Vernie       s behaviour, he said very
little.
Landon scolded her roundly, while Milly said
nothing at all.
The whole affair cast rather a gloom over them
all, for it seemed as if the spectre had at last really
manifested itself in earnest. An undoubted appearance
to an innocent child was far more convincing
than to a grown person of avowed psychic
tendencies. Eve Carnforth might have imagined
much of the story she told; her        expectant attention       
might have exaggerated the facts; but Vernie       s
mind was like a page of white paper, on which
the scene she passed through had left a clear
imprint.
[094]
That night Vernie herself got out the Ouija board
and asked Eve to help her try it.
       No,        was the reply.        I       m too broken up.
And, too, the people don       t believe me. Get your
uncle or Mr. Tracy or some truthful and honourable
person to help you.       
It embittered Eve that her earnestness and her
implicit belief in the supernatural made it more
difficult for the others to look upon her as entirely
disingenuous. She resented this, and was a little
morose in consequence. Norma Cameron, herself
an avowed        sensitive,        had had no spiritistic visitant
in the haunted room, and Eve thought Norma
had doubted her word.
At last after trying all the others that she
wanted, Vernie persuaded good-natured Mr. Tracy
to move Ouija with her, and the two sat down
with the board between them.
Few and flippant messages were forthcoming,
until, just as Vernie had laughingly declared she
would throw the old thing out of the window, a
startling sentence formed itself from the erratic
dartings of the heart-shaped toy, and Vernie
turned pale.
       Stop it!        ordered Tracy,        I refuse to touch
it again!       
He removed his hands and sat back, but Vernie,
glaring at the letters, held it a moment longer.
       To-morrow! it says to-morrow!        she cried.
       Oh, Eve, I told you so!       
[095]
       What, Vernie? What is it, dear?        and Eve
Carnforth came over to the excited child.
       Ouija, Eve! Ouija said that to-morrow at
four, two of us are to die! Oh, Eve, you know
every death in this house has occurred at four
o       clock in the morning! Mr. Stebbins said so.
And now, two of us are to die to-morrow!       
       Nonsense!        cried Mr. Tracy,        don       t listen to
that rubbish! The Ouija ran off its track. Maybe
Vernie pushed it,       maybe I did.       
       Now, Mr. Tracy, I didn       t push it, and you
needn       t try to make anybody think you did! You
never       d push it to say a thing like that! Why, it
spelled it all out as plain as day! Uncle Gifford,
do you hear! Two of us to die to-morrow!       
Vernie       s voice rose to a hysterical shriek.
       Hush, Vernie! Hush, child. I       ll take you
away from here to-morrow. We ought never to
have brought you,        and Gifford Bruce glowered at
the others as he clasped the sobbing child in his
arms, and took her from the room.
       You       re right,        agreed Mr. Tracy,        and Braye
was right. He said a fright or shock would upset
that child       s nerves completely. But she must
have pushed the board herself. It flew round like
lightning, and spelled out the message, just as she
said. I tried to steer it off, but she urged against
me. I felt her doing so. I don       t mean she made
up the message to create a sensation, but I think
the ghost last night affected her as a warning, and
her mind is so full of it, that she unconsciously
or subconsciously worked up that        message.        At
any rate, I       ve had about enough of this, if she       s to
be here. It isn       t right to frighten a child so, and
Vernie is little more than a child.       
[096]
       That       s so,        said Norma, thoughtfully.        I       ve
had enough, too. If the rest of you want to stay
on, I       ll go down to New York to-morrow, and take
Vernie to stay with me for a while. We       ll go to
the seashore, and I       ll see to it that she has no
psychic or supernatural experiences.       
       Why, Norma,        and Eve looked surprised,
       I thought you were so interested in these
things.       
       So I am, but not to the extent of so affecting
the nervous system of a sweet, innocent child, that
it may result in permanent injury.       
       She       s all right,        said Gifford Bruce, returning,
alone.        It       s hysteria. I think I       ll take her back
to town to-morrow or next day. There       s something
uncanny up here, that       s certain. I didn       t
take any stock in the experiences of you people,
but I can       t disbelieve Vernie       s story.       
The party broke up and all went to their rooms.
There was no volunteer to sleep in the haunted
room that night, and every one felt a shivering
dread of what might happen at four o       clock the
next morning.
Not one admitted it, but every one secretly
shuddered at thought of Ouija       s message.
[097]
And when, as the hall clock rung out its four
strokes the next morning, and nothing untoward
happened, every one drew a long breath and
soon went to sleep again, relieved, as of a heavy
burden.
Gaily they gathered at breakfast, daylight and
good cheer reviving their spirits.
       But Ouija is henceforth taboo,        said Mr.
Tracy, shaking his finger at the now laughing
Vernie.
       For little girls, anyway,        supplemented Eve.
       Little girls are taboo, also,        declared Gifford
Bruce.        I can       t get off to-day, for I want to
see Rudolph on his return, but to-morrow, I pack
up my Vernie child and take her back to our own
little old Chicago on the lake. These Aspens are
too black for us!       
       Now, Uncle, I don       t want to go,        and Vernie
pouted prettily.        And sumpum tells me I won       t
go,        she added with a roguish glance at her uncle,
whom she usually twisted round her rosy little
finger.
But he gave her a grave smile in return, and the
subject was dropped for the moment.
Soon after noon, Braye came up from the city,
and listened, frowning, to the tales that were told
him.
       You promised me, Vernie,        he said, reproachfully.
[098]
       I know it, Cousin Rudolph, but you see, I       ve
never kept a promise in my whole life,       and I didn       t
want to break my record!       
       Naughty Flapper! I won       t give you the present
I brought for you.       
       Oh, yes you will,        and so wheedlesome was the
lovely face, and so persuasive the soft voice, that
Vernie, after a short argument, seized upon a small
jeweller       s packet and unwrapped a pretty little ring.
       Angel Cousin,        she observed,        you       re just
about the nicest cousin I possess,       beside being the
only one!       
       Doubtful compliment!        laughed Braye.        Any
way, you       re the prettiest and naughtiest cousin I
own! As a punishment for your disobedience I
challenge you to a round with old Ouija to-night!
I       ll bet I can make it say something more cheerful
than you wormed out of it last evening.       
       All right, we       ll try it,        and Vernie danced gaily
away to tease her uncle not to take her home.
A little later, Milly, as housekeeper, discovered
some serious shortage in the commissariat department,
and Braye offered to drive her over to East
Dryden, marketing.
They started off, Milly calling back to Eve to
preside at the tea-table, if she didn       t return in time.
       All right,        agreed Eve, though Vernie vociferously
announced her intention of playing hostess in
Milly       s absence.
The shoppers had not returned when old Thorpe
brought in the tea-tray.
[099]
       You can pour, Eve, and I       ll pass the cakies,       
said Vernie, who was in high spirits, for she had
partially persuaded her uncle to remain longer at
Black Aspens. He was just phrasing certain
strong stipulations on which his permission was to
be based, when the tea things arrived.
They were, as usual, in the hall, for though they
sometimes suggested the plan of having tea out of
doors, there was no cheerful terrace, or pleasant
porch. The hall, though sombre and vast, had become
more or less homelike by virtue of usage, so
there they took their tea.
Mr. Tracy, always graceful in social matters,
helped pass the cups and plates, for no one liked
to have the old Thorpes about unnecessarily.
       No tea for me, please,        declared Norma;        I
think it upsets my nerves,                     
       And that is not the thing to do in this house,       
laughed Landon.        This is mighty good tea,
though,       didn       t know anybody could brew it as
well as Milly. Congratulations, Eve.       
       Thank you,        and Eve       s long lashes swept upward
as she gave him a coquettish glance.
       Referring to that matter of which we were
talking, Hardwick,        Gifford Bruce began,        I                     
Even as he spoke, the clock chimed four, and, as
always, they paused to count the long, slow strokes.
Then Bruce began again:        I think, myself                     
[100]
A strange change passed over his face. His jaw
fell, his eyes stared, and then, his teacup fell from
his hand, and he slumped down in an awful       a terrifying
heap!
Landon sprang to his assistance, Norma ran to
him, while Tracy, with a quick glance at Vernie,
flew to the child       s side.
       What is it?        he cried to her,        what       s the
matter, Vernie?        He slipped an arm round her,
just as, with a wild look and a ringing shriek, the
girl       s head fell back and her eyes closed.
       Oh,        cried Eve,        what has happened?       
       I don       t know,        and Tracy       s voice shook.
       Help me, Miss Carnforth       let us lay her on this
sofa.       
Between them they carried the girl, for she was
past muscular effort, and as they placed her gently
on the sofa her eyes fluttered, she gave a gasping
sigh, and fell back, inert.
       Oh,        cried Eve,        she isn       t       she isn       t       oh, it       s
just four o       clock!       
Landon ran to Vernie       s side and felt of her heart.
       She is dead,        he said, solemnly, his face white,
his voice shaking;        and Gifford Bruce is dead, too.
It is four o       clock!       
[101]
CHAPTER VII
The Mystery
In the panic-stricken moments that followed the
realization of the double tragedy, the natural
characteristics of all those present showed
themselves. Eve Carnforth, strong and calm, suddenly
became self-appointed dictator.
       Lay Mr. Bruce flat on his back,        she called out,
as she darted upstairs for her room, and returned
with smelling salts, ammonia and such things.
Tracy, also capable and self-possessed, took a
vial from her and held it before the face of the
stricken child, while others strove to bring back to
consciousness the motionless figure of Gifford
Bruce, now stretched on the floor.
       It       s no use,        declared Landon, flinging the beads
of sweat from his forehead,        they are dead,       both
of them. Oh, what does it mean?       
Norma sat in a big chair, her hands clutching its
carved arms, and her face stony white. She was
using all her will power to keep from utter collapse,
and she couldn       t understand how Eve could be so
natural and self-possessed.
       Brace up, Norma,        Eve admonished her;        here,
take this salts-bottle. Now is no time to make more
trouble!       
[102]
The brusque words had the effect of rousing
Norma, and she forced herself to rise.
       What can I do?        she whispered.
       Do!        cried Eve,        there       s everything to do!
Some one telephone for a doctor!       
       I       can       t,        Norma moaned.        You do that,
Professor,       won       t you?       
       Oh, I can       t!        and Hardwick fell limply into a
chair.        I       I       m all upset                     
       Of course you are, Professor,        said Tracy,
kindly.        I       ll telephone, Miss Carnforth. Do you
know the village doctor       s name? Of course,       it       s
too late                      he glanced at the two still forms,        but
a physician must be summoned.       
       No, I don       t know any name,       call Thorpe, or
Hester.       
Tracy rang a bell and Thorpe came shuffling in.
At sight of the tragedy, he turned and ran,
screaming. Hester came, and proved the more useful
of the two. Her stolidity was helpful, and she
told the doctor       s name and number.
       Dead, ain       t they?        she said, with a grieved intonation
that robbed her words of curtness.        What
happened to        em?       
The simple question roused them all. What had
happened? What had killed two strong, well, able-bodied
people at the same moment, and that the
very moment said to be fatal in that dread
house?
[103]
       I believe,        said the Professor, dropping his face
in his hands,        I believe now in the supernatural.
Nothing else can explain this thing.       
       Of course not,        and Eve solemnly acquiesced.
       There is no possibility of anything else.
What could kill them, like this, at once, and
at four o       clock exactly, except a supernormal
agent?       
       But that seems so impossible!        and Tracy       s
practical, matter-of-fact voice did indeed make it
seem so.
       What else is possible?        broke in Landon.        It
isn       t suicide, it isn       t murder. It isn       t death from
natural causes,       at least, it can       t be in Vernie       s case,       I
suppose Mr. Bruce might have died from heart
disease.       
       That       s why we want a doctor,        said Eve.        We
can judge nothing until we know the immediate
cause of death.       
       I wish we were in the city,        Tracy said;        the
doctor will be nearly an hour getting here, I suppose.       
       Did you tell him all?        asked Eve.
       No, I didn       t. It didn       t seem wise to spread the
news in that way. I told him to get here as soon as
he possibly could,       that it was a matter of life and
death.       
       Which it certainly is,        murmured Norma.
       Oh, Eve, what do you really think?       
[104]
Eve Carnforth looked at the other girl. Eve, so
poised and collected, strength and will power written
in every line of her face,       Norma so fragile,
and shaken by the awful scenes about her.
       I don       t know what to think,        Eve replied,
slowly.        There       s only one thing certain, Vernie
received a warning of death,       and Vernie is dead.
Mr. Bruce received no definite warning, that I know
of, but he may have had one. You know, he said
he was visited by the phantom, but we wouldn       t believe
him.       
       That       s so!        and Tracy looked up in surprise.
       We never quite believed Mr. Bruce       s statements,
because he scorned all talk of spirit manifestations.
If he really did see the ghost that night that he said
he did                     
       Of course he did,        declared Eve.        I believed
him all the time. I can always tell when any one
is speaking the truth. It       s part of my sensitive
nature.       
Wynne Landon stalked about the hall like a man
in torment.        What shall I do with Milly?        he
groaned.        She and Braye will be back soon,       any
minute now. She mustn       t see these                     
       They ought to be placed in some other room,       
said Eve, gently.
[105]
       One mustn       t touch a dead body before                     
began Professor Hardwick, but Tracy interrupted
him.        That       s in case of murder, Professor,        he
said;        this is a different matter. Whatever caused
these deaths, it wasn       t by the hand of another human
being. If it was fright or nervous apprehension,
Those are to be classed among natural causes.
I think we are wholly justified in moving the
bodies.       
After some discussion, Landon and the Professor
agreed with Tracy, and with the help of Thorpe
and Hester, the stricken forms were carried out of
the hall, where the group so often forgathered.
       It is better,        said Eve,        for we need this hall
continually, and if we don       t move them at once, the
doctor may forbid it, when he comes.       
By common consent, the body of Gifford Bruce
was laid in the drawing room, on a large sofa, and
Vernie       s slender figure was reverently placed on the
bed in the Room with the Tassels.
       No spirit shape can frighten her now,        said
Norma, weeping bitterly, as Thorpe and Hester carried
the dead girl in. Then both doors were closed,
shutting off the silent figures, and those who were
left felt a vague sense of relief.
       Now we can break it to Milly more gently,       
said Eve.        Clear away that broken cup, Hester,
and make some fresh tea, I       m sure we all
need it.       
On the great rug the damp spot remained where
the spilled tea had fallen, and Eve ordered a smaller
rug placed over it.
Braye and Milly came in laughing.
[106]
       We       ve bought out the whole of East Dryden!       
Milly exclaimed,        and what do you think? We
found some fresh lobsters, still alive and kicking,       and
we commandeered them at once. What       s the
matter with you people? You look solemn as
owls!       
       Come up to your room, Milly, to take off your
wraps,        and Landon took her arm to lead her away.
       Nonsense, Wynne, I       ll throw them off down
here. I       m thirsty for tea.       
       No; come on, dear. Come with me.       
Awed at his tone, Milly went with him, and they
disappeared up the staircase.
Then Professor Hardwick told Braye what had
happened. The others had begged the Professor to
do this, and in a very few words the tale was told.
       It can       t be!        and Braye rose and walked up and
down the hall.        I wish I had been here! Oh, forgive
me, all of you, I know you did all you could,       but       restoratives                     
       We did,        said Eve,        I ran for sal volatile and
such things, but you don       t understand,       it was instantaneous,       wasn       t
it, Mr. Tracy?       
       It was,        replied Tracy, gravely.        Mr. Bruce
was speaking, naturally and normally. He paused
when the clock struck,       we        most always do, you
know, it       s a sort of habit.       
       We have to, really,        said Norma.        That
clock strikes so loudly, one can       t go on talking.       
[107]
       And then,        began the Professor,        he was talking
to me, you know, and I was looking straight
at him, his face changed in an instant, his fingers
spread, as if galvanized, his teacup fell from his
hand, and in a moment, he was gone! Yes, dead
in a second, I should say.       
       And       Vernie?        Braye spoke with difficulty.
       I chanced to be looking at Vernie,        said Mr.
Tracy.        The outcry concerning Mr. Bruce made
us all look toward him, and then, a sudden sound
from Vernie drew my attention to her. She gasped,
and her face looked queer,       sort of drawn and
gray,       so I sprang to her side, and held her up, lest
she fall. She was standing, looking at Mr. Bruce,
of course. I felt her sway, her head fell back, and
then Miss Carnforth came to my assistance, and we
laid her quickly down on the sofa. In an instant,
the child was dead. It is incredible that it should
have been a case of sudden fright that proved fatal,
and yet, what other theory is there? It couldn       t be
heart disease in a child of sixteen!       
       No,        mused Braye,        and yet, what could it
have been? I won       t subscribe to any supernatural
theory now! It       s too absurd!       
       It       s the only thing that isn       t absurd!        contradicted
Eve.        Remember, Rudolph, Vernie had the
warning                     
       Warning be hanged!        cried Braye, explosively.
       But think,        went on Eve, gently,        the phantom
told Vernie she would die at four o       clock                     
       Four o       clock in the morning, Vernie said! If
I had thought of four in the afternoon, I wouldn       t
have gone out!       
[108]
       Nobody knows that the message said four in
the morning. Vernie told me about it many times,
and she only said four. You know, the phantom
spoke no word, it merely designated by its fingers,       one,
two, three, four! Also, Vernie said it carried
two glasses of poison.       
       But they weren       t poisoned!       
       No; that was merely the symbol of death.
Also, Rudolph, remember the Ouija board said two
would die at four. You can       t get away from these
things!       
       That confounded Ouija performance was on
one of the nights I was in New York! I wish I
hadn       t gone! But Vernie promised me she wouldn       t
sleep in that room. I was a fool to believe her.
You see, Eve, I feel a sort of responsibility for the
child. Uncle Gif was so easy-going and indulgent,       he
was no sort of a guardian for her, now she
was growing up. I planned to have her put under
the care of some right kind of a woman this fall,
and brought up properly.       
       I know it, Rudolph; you were very fond of
her.       
       Not only that, but I appreciated what she
needed, and I meant to see that she got it. Oh,
Eve, I can       t realize this thing.       
[109]
Doctor Wayburn came in. It was plain to be
seen the man was scared. In his years of country
practice he had never run up against anything tragic
or thrilling before, and he was overwhelmed. With
trembling step he entered the room of death, and
first made examination of the body of Gifford
Bruce. It did not take long. There was no apparent
cause for death. No symptoms were present
of any fatal disease, nor, so far as he could see,
of any poison or wound of any sort.
       I cannot say what an autopsy may divulge,       
declared the frightened practitioner,        but from this
superficial examination, I find no cause of dissolution.       
Then he crossed the hall, to the Room with the
Tassels.
Braye followed him in, Eve also. The Professor
and Tracy stood in the doorway, but Norma remained
in the hall, her face buried in some sofa
cushions.
       No apparent cause,        the Doctor repeated.
       This child was in perfect health; I should say
fright might have killed her, but it doesn       t seem
credible. I know of no cause of any sort, that
could bring about death in an instant of time, as
you report.       
       Maybe not an instant,        corrected the Professor,
carefully.        As I look back, I should judge there
was at least a half a minute between Mr. Bruce       s
first symptom of unease, and his falling to the
floor.       
       So with Vernie,        said Eve, thoughtfully.        I
saw Mr. Tracy go quickly toward her; I followed
immediately, and I       m sure there was nearly a half
minute, but not more, before she gasped and died.       
[110]
       It       s hard to judge time on such occasions,        said
the Doctor, looking sharply at Eve.
       I know it, but I was very conscious of it all,
almost clairvoyantly so, and I can assure you it
was not longer than a half minute in either case,
between the state of usual health and death itself.
Is there any cause or agent that will work as quickly
as that?       
       I know of none,        replied Doctor Wayburn,
positively.
       There is none,        Eve assured him.        These
deaths were caused by supernatural means, they
were the vengeance of certain Powers of Darkness.       
       Oh, come now, Eve,        expostulated Braye,
       don       t get off that stuff to the Doctor. Keep that
for our own circle. You know these fatalities
couldn       t have been caused by a ghost!       
       What, then?       
       I don       t know. Fright, perhaps, or over-apprehension
because of the warnings. Auto-suggestion,
if you like, and so indirectly the result of the spooks,
but not the direct work of a disembodied spirit.       
       It was, all the same!        and Eve left the room
and went to sit by Norma.
But the girls were not in sympathy. Their conversation
resulted in disagreement, and, at last, in
Norma       s bursting into tears and running upstairs.
[111]
She sought Milly, and found her prostrated by
Landon       s news. But she was trying to be brave,
and earnestly endeavouring to preserve her self-control.
       I know every one thinks I       ll go to pieces,        she
said, pathetically,        and make more trouble for you
all,       but I won       t. I       ve promised Wynne I       ll be
brave and if I can       t keep quiet and composed, I       ll
stay in my room, and not upset the crowd.       
       You       re all right, Milly,        Norma reassured
her,        you let yourself go all you want to. Don       t
overdo your restraint. I       ll look after you.       
       Yes, do, Norma. Don       t let Eve come near me.
I can       t stand her!       
       Why? You mustn       t be unjust to Eve. She
behaved splendidly at that awful time.       
       Yes, I know. But if it hadn       t been for Eve
we never would have come up here at all.       
       Oh, Milly, that isn       t fair! We all agreed to
come here. It wasn       t Eve       s doing any more than
mine!       
       Yes, it was. But, look here, Norma, tell me
truly. What do you think killed Mr. Bruce and
Vernie?       
       I don       t know, Milly, dear. You know I do believe
in psychics and in spiritism and in the return
to earth of the souls of people who have died, but       I
can       t believe that any such spirit would kill an
innocent child, or a fine old man. I can       t believe
it!       
[112]
       But why not, Norma? If you believe in the
return to earth of good spirits, why not bad spirits,
as well? And if so, why couldn       t they kill people,
if they want to?       
       You sound logical, Milly, but it       s absurd.       
       No, it isn       t. You and Eve believe in good
spirits and in their power to do good. Why not,
then, in bad spirits and their power to do evil?       
       Let up, Milly,        begged Landon, who stood near
by.        She       s been going on like that, Norma, ever
since I told her. Can       t you explain to her                     
       Explain what?       
       Lord! I don       t know! But make her see how
impossible it is that the ghost of that woman who
killed her husband here so long ago, should have
any reason to do away with two modern present-day
people!       
       But I want to think so, Wynne,        and Milly       s
eyes stared with a peculiar light.        I       d rather think
they were killed by that ghost than by a person,       wouldn       t
you?       
       What do you mean, Milly? Murdered?       
       Yes, Eve. That       s what it must have been, if
not spirits. They had no mortal disease, either of
them.       
       Don       t mention that before any one else,        admonished
Eve, very seriously.        There are other
explanations, Milly. Many deaths have been
brought about by sudden fright or by continuous
apprehension of imaginary danger. Vernie had
been warned twice. True, I didn       t think of four in
the afternoon, but doubtless she did, and maybe,
seeing the sudden attack of Mr. Bruce, so startled
her that she thought of the four o       clock doom and
gave way herself.       
[113]
       She might give way to the extent of fainting,
or a fit of hysterics,        admitted Milly,        but not to
the extent of dropping dead! It       s unthinkable,       it       s
unbelievable                     
       It       s almost unbelievable that they should be
dead,        Eve said, softly,        but as to how they died,
let       s not speculate, dear. I suppose we must have
a doctor up from New York,       what do you think,
Mr. Landon?       
       Eh?       oh, I don       t know,       I       m sure I don       t
know.       
       But you       ll have to take charge, won       t you?       
asked Eve.        You two are really the heads of this
house                     
       All I want is to get away,        moaned Milly.
       When can we go, Wynne?       
       I don       t know, dear. Say, Eve, won       t you take
Milly down to-night? I can       t leave, of course, but
I daren       t keep her here, lest she go to pieces. You
take her home,       there       s a train in about an hour.       
       Oh, I can       t. I want to stay here. Send Norma,       no,
she       s no good,       perhaps Mr. Tracy will take
Milly down. He       s awfully kind, and ready to do
anything.       
[114]
As Milly declared herself now willing, the three
went downstairs. They found the others in the
hall, the Doctor still there, and the tea things still
about. Eve gave Milly some tea, and took some
herself.
       I       ll have to call in the coroner,        Doctor Wayburn
was saying;        it isn       t apparently a murder, and
yet it       s a mysterious death,       they both are. Yes,
the county physician must be summoned.       
The Doctor had gotten over the first panic of
surprise, and began to feel a sense of importance.
Such a case had never come near him before, and
the whole affair gave him a pleasant feeling of responsibility
and foreshadowed his prominence in the
public eye.
The suggestion of a coroner was resented by all
who listened, but the Doctor       s word was law in the
case, so they unwillingly consented.
       I think I       d better go down to New York to-night,       
said Braye.        There are so many things to
see to, so many people to notify, the reporters to
look after, and       undertaking arrangements to be
made. Unless you want to go, Wynne?       
       No,        said Landon,        it       s better for you, Rudolph.
But I wish you       d take Milly. Take her to
her mother       s and let her get out of this atmosphere.
Will you go, Milly?       
       I did want to, Wynne, when I was upstairs.
But, now, with people all about,       if Norma will
stay here, too, I       d rather stay with you. When are
you going down, Wynne?       
[115]
       I don       t know, dear. We       ll have to see how
things turn out. Well, you go ahead, Rudolph,
you       ll have to hustle to get over to the train. And
there are a few matters I wish you       d look after for
me.       
The two men went off to discuss these matters,
and then Doctor Wayburn, who had been telephoning,
announced that the coroner could not come
until the next day, as he was in another township
attending to some duties.
       And I       m glad of it,        said Eve,        for we       ve had
enough excitement for one day.       
And so, by ten or eleven o       clock, the house was
locked up and the members of the household gone
to bed, all except old Thorpe, who sat in the great
hall, with the two doors open into the rooms where
the still, tragic figures lay. Before him, on a table,
Hester had placed coffee and sandwiches, and the
old man sat, brooding on the awful events of the
afternoon.
[116]
CHAPTER VIII
By What Means
The night was full of restlessness. Tracy
and Professor Hardwick, in their adjoining
rooms, were the only ones in the wing that
had the night before also housed Braye and Gifford
Bruce.
       Shall we leave the door between open?        Tracy
asked, more out of consideration for the Professor       s
nerves than his own.
       Yes, if you will. And don       t go to bed yet. I
can       t sleep, I know, and I must discuss this thing
with somebody, or go mad!       
       All right, sir,        and Tracy took off his coat and
donned an old-fashioned dressing-gown.
Hardwick smiled.        That       s the first ministerial
garb I       ve seen you wear,        he said.        I       d pick that
up for a dominie       s neglig         every time!       
       I       m rather attached to the old dud,        and Tracy
patted it affectionately.        Queer, how one comes to
love a worn garment. No, I don       t wear clerical
togs when off on a vacation. I used to, till some
one told me it cast a restraint over the others, and
I hate to feel I       m doing that.       
[117]
       You       d never do that, my friend. You       ve a
natural tact that ought to carry you far toward
general popularity. But, tell me, as man to man,
how do you size up this awful mystery?       
       I don       t know, Professor. At times my mind       s
a blank,       and then, I get a hint or,       well, I can       t
call it a suspicion,       but a thought, say, in one direction,
and it       s so fearfully absurd, I discard it at
once. Then comes another idea, only to be dismissed
like the first. What do you think?       
       I am a complete convert to the supernatural.
You know, Sir Oliver Lodge and many other scientists
only believed after they had had undeniable
personal experience. Now, here were warnings,       definite,
positive prophecies, and they were fulfilled.
What more can any one ask?       
Tracy mused over this.        I know that,        he said,
at last,        but I can       t quite swallow it whole, like
that. Do you mean there was no physical cause?
Such as fright, expectant attention,                     
       Expectant attention is a fine phrase,       much like
auto-suggestion. They are all right as far as they
go, but they can       t go to the extent of killing people.
Then again, suggest even a theory, even a possible
means of the death of those two by any human
agency. Murder is out of the question,       suicide
even more so. And they had no desire to end their
lives. A young girl, happily looking forward to
gaiety and pleasure,       a man in the prime of life,
hale, rich, prosperous       no, they had no wish to
die!       
[118]
       True enough; but I can       t quite see it. Why did
the spirits want to kill them? if spirits did kill
them?       
       For interfering with this haunted house,       in a
frivolous and flippant way. I       ve always heard that
departed souls bitterly resent scoffing, or merely
curious investigation.       
       But why choose those two? Or Vernie, anyway?
Perhaps Mr. Bruce was needlessly sarcastic
and sceptical.       
       So was the child                     
       Oh, but in such an innocent, harmless way!
However, Professor, I       ve nothing to offer in place
of your argument. My creed does not admit of my
subscribing to your theory, but I confess I       m unable
to suggest any other. As you say, it couldn       t have
been suicide, and there       s no possibility of foul play.       
The two men talked on, or sat in silent thought,
far into the night. The clock struck twelve before
they at last retired, leaving open their communication
door, and securely locking their hall doors.
Less than an hour later, a slender white-robed
figure tiptoed from one of the bedrooms and looked
over the banisters. Peering down through the
darkness, the dim outline of old Thorpe       s form
was visible. He was huddled in his chair, his head
fallen forward on the table. Softly returning to
her room for a wrap, Eve again stealthily came to
the staircase, and sat down on the uppermost step.
[119]
Later still, another door silently opened, and a
pair of surprised blue eyes saw Eve sitting there.
Suppressing a startled exclamation, Norma scurried
back to her room, but Eve did not hear her.
Milly was wakeful and restless. Several times
she declared she heard sounds, but when Wynne
wanted to go and investigate, she refused to let him
do so.
The house surely seemed haunted. The aspens
brushed against the windows with their eternal
soughing, their leaves whispering,       hissing creepy
secrets, and their branches tapping eerily on the
panes. The halls were full of shadows, vague, indistinct,
fading to nothingness.
At four o       clock the great clock tolled the hour,
and every one in the house heard it. No one was
asleep, every heart was beating fast, every eye wide
open, every nerve tense.
But nothing happened; no shriek rent the silence,
no unusual or terrifying sound was heard.
Relieved, some went to sleep again, some tossed
restlessly on their pillows until rising time.
At breakfast all looked haggard and worn. The
day was cool and pleasant, the dining room bright
with sunshine, and old Hester       s viands most appetizing.
Thorpe had closed the doors of the rooms given
over to the presence of death, and as the various
members of the party came down the staircase quick
apprehensive glances were followed by a look of
relief.
[120]
Elijah Stebbins came while breakfast was in progress,
and at Milly       s invitation took a seat at the
board.
       Well,        he said heavily,        you folks wanted
spooks, I hope you       re satisfied.       
       Don       t use that tone, Mr. Stebbins,        Landon
reproved him.        A dreadful thing has happened.
I cannot think it is by supernatural causes nor can
I see any other explanation. But that is no reason
for you to speak flippantly of our investigations of
your so-called haunted house.       
       No offence meant,        and Stebbins cringed.
       But I       m thinkin        you folks had better go away
from here, or there       s no tellin        what might happen.       
       Do you know anything about the mystery?       
Professor Hardwick shot out the question so suddenly
that Stebbins jumped.
       No, sir, of course I don       t, sir! How could I?       
       Then why do you warn us off the premises?       
       I don       t exactly do that, but I       d think you       d
reason for yourselves that what happens once can
happen ag       in.       
The dogged look on the man       s face seemed portentous
of evil, and Milly began to cry.
       Oh, take me home, Wynne,        she begged;        I
don       t want to stay here!       
       Come with me, Milly,        said Eve, and rising, she
led Milly from the room.
It was shortly after that the coroner arrived.
[121]
       I don       t want to see that man,        said Stebbins,
       him and me ain       t good friends,        and rising quickly,
the owner of the house fled toward the kitchen
quarters, and spent the rest of the morning with the
Thorpes out there.
Doctor Crawford, the county physician and
coroner, was a man of slow speech and dignified
manner. He was appalled by the circumstances in
which he found himself, and a little frightened at
the hints he had heard of ghostly visitations.
Indeed, that had been the real reason for his delay
in arriving,       he had not been willing to brave the
darkness of the night before. This was his secret,
however, and his excuse of conflicting duties had
been accepted.
The whole party gathered in the hall to hear what
the newcomer had to say.
Eve and Milly returned, the latter, quivering and
tearful, going straight to her husband       s side, and
sitting close to him.
Norma was pale and trembling, too, and Tracy       s
watchful eye regarded her sympathetically, as he
led her to a seat.
Eve, self-reliant and calm, flitted about incessantly.
She went to the kitchen and talked over
household matters with Hester, for Milly was unable
to do this. Then, returning, Eve went into the
drawing room, and after a few moments returned,
closing the door again after her. Then she stepped
into the Room with the Tassels. She was there
longer, but at last came out, and locking the door
behind her, retained the key. No one noticed this
but Norma, and she kept her own counsel, but she
also kept a watchful eye on Eve.
[122]
Even before he went to look at the bodies of the
two victims of the tragedy, Doctor Crawford asked
some questions.
His slowness was maddening to the alert minds
of his listeners, but he methodically arrived at the
facts of the case.
       I am told by my colleague, Doctor Wayburn,       
he said,        that there is no mark or sign on the
remains to indicate the cause of death. There will,
of course, be need of autopsies, but for that I will
await Doctor Wayburn       s return. He will be here
shortly. Meantime, I will inquire concerning this
strange information I have received, hinting at a
belief in       ahem       in spiritualism, by some of the
people here present. Is such belief held, may I
ask?       
       Perhaps belief is too strong a word,        the Professor
volunteered, as no one else spoke,        but I may
tell you that we came here to this house for the
purpose of investigating the truth of the story that
the house is haunted.       
       And have you made such investigations?       
       We have tried to do so. The results have been
mysterious, startling and now,       tragic,       but I cannot
say we have proved anything, except that supernatural
influences have most assuredly been at
work.       
[123]
       I am not willing to accept such an explanation
of two sudden deaths,        Crawford said, in his dignified
way,        at any rate, not without a most exhaustive
investigation into the possibility of their having
been brought about by natural agencies. Let me
take up first the case of Mr. Bruce. Was this
gentleman in robust health?       
       Entirely so,        said Landon,        so far as we know.
It is not inconceivable that he had some heart
trouble or other malady that was not noticeable, but
of that I cannot say positively. It seems to me,
Doctor, you would better look at him, you might
note some symptom that would enlighten you.       
Crawford shuddered perceptibly, but tried to hide
his disinclination. Though accustomed to gruesome
sights, his dread of the supernatural was such that
he feared the proposed examination. However,
ashamed of his hesitation, he rose, and asked to be
shown the body of Gifford Bruce.
Landon started to officiate, but Milly       s detaining
hand held him back; the Professor made no move,
but Eve and Tracy started simultaneously to rise.
       I       ll go,        said Eve, a little officiously, and Tracy
sat down again.
She led the way to the big drawing room, where
the remains of Gifford Bruce lay, and stood by while
Doctor Crawford looked down at the still, white
face.
[124]
A long time they stood there, no word being
spoken. Then Eve said softly,        Don       t let your disbelief
in supernatural powers blind you to their
possible reality. There are many matters yet unknown
and spiritism is one of them. Remember
that we who are here gathered are sensitives and
psychics. We are prepared for and expect experiences
not vouchsafed to less clairvoyant natures,       though
we did not look for this! But I beg of you,
sir, to realize that there are things of which you
have no cognizance, that yet are real and effective.       
Doctor Crawford looked at the speaker. In the
partially darkened room, Eve       s strange eyes glittered
with an uncanny light. Her face was pale,
and her red hair like a flame aureole. She took a
slow step nearer to the doctor, and he recoiled, as
from a vampire.
       You are afraid!        she said, and her tone was
exultant.        Do not be afraid,       the phantasms will
not hurt you if you do your duty. Unless you do
your duty                      she stretched her hand toward him,
and again he drew away,        the phantasms will haunt
you       haunt you       haunt you!       
Her voice fell to the merest whisper, but it
thrilled through the room like a clarion note to the
shocked ears of the listening man.
Against his will her eyes held his; against his will,
without his volition, he whispered,        What is my
duty?       
[125]
       To declare,       to declare in accordance with your
own conviction, in proof of your own belief,       that
these two deaths were the direct result of a supernatural
power. What power, you know not, but
you do know       remember, you do know, that no
mortal hand brought the tragedy about, either the
hands of the victims themselves or of any one else.       
Fascinated, frightened, Crawford stared at this
strange woman. He had never before encountered
such a face, such a sinuous, serpentine form, a personality
that seemed to sway his very being, that
seemed to dominate and control his whole will
power, his whole brain power.
       Don       t misunderstand me,        Eve went on,        don       t
think for a moment, I am advising you wrongly, or
with intent to deceive. Only, I see you know nothing
of occult phenomena, and moreover, you are
even ignorant of your own ignorance of them.
Therefore, seeing, too, your quick appreciation and
perceptive faculty, I warn you not to ignore or forget
the fact that these things exist, that unseen
powers hold sway over us all, and they must be reckoned
with.       
The flattery was subtle. More than the words,
Eve       s glance implied a keen apprehension on the
part of the doctor, which, as he didn       t possess it,
seemed a desirable thing to him, and he gladly assumed
that he had it.
       And now,        Eve said, as they left the room,        do
you want to go to the other room       the Room with
the Tassels?       
[126]
       No       please, not now,        and Crawford shuddered,
for he had heard much of that room. Also,
he was desirous of getting back to more normal
associates than this strange being, and he resolved
to leave the examination of the other victim until
the return of his fellow physician, who at least was
practical, and an unbeliever in spooks.
Shaken by the whole episode, Doctor Crawford
concealed his disquiet by a manner even more slow
and deliberate than usual. He said no word of
Gifford Bruce, but announced his desire to ask a
few general questions concerning practical matters.
       Where is your home, Mr. Landon?        he inquired,
and then asked the same question of each.
He learned that they were all residents of New
York City, except Mr. Tracy, who had lived in
Philadelphia, but was contemplating a move to New
York.
       I have had a call to a pastorate there,        Tracy
stated,        and it seems advisable to me to accept
it.       
       Mr. Bruce lived in Chicago, did he not?        went
on Crawford,        and Miss Reid, also?       
       Yes,        said Landon,        but Miss Reid had been
at school in Connecticut for the last three years.
She was graduated in June, and her uncle and guardian,
Mr. Bruce, came East for the occasion. They
concluded to spend the summer with us, intending to
return to Chicago next month.       
       Mr. Bruce was a wealthy man?        inquired the
questioner.
       Yes;        answered Landon,        not a financial magnate,
but worth at least two million dollars.       
[127]
       And who are his heirs?       
The question fell like a bombshell. It had not
been thought of, or at least not spoken of, by any
of the party. The bareness of it, the implication
of it, gave a shock, as of a sudden accusation.
       I hadn       t thought of that,        Wynne Landon said,
slowly.
       But you know?        queried Crawford.
       Of course I know. Unless Gifford Bruce left a
contradictory will, his estate must revert to Rudolph
Braye, the son of Mr. Bruce       s half-brother                     
       Why, Wynne,        interrupted Milly,        you       re a
cousin.       
       I am,        and Landon flushed unaccountably,        but
I       m a second cousin. Braye would inherit, unless
a will made other proviso.       
       Where is Mr. Braye?       
       He went to New York last evening and has not
yet returned.       
       You expect him soon?       
       This afternoon, probably. Of course, he has
realized that he is the heir of a great fortune, but
naturally he would not discuss it last evening, when
we were all so alarmed and excited over the awfulness
of the situation.       
       Was Mr. Braye present at the time of the       tragedy?       
       No;        Landon stopped to think.        He wasn       t.
Where was he?       
[128]
       He was with me,        said Milly.        We went in
his car to East Dryden. We went to the markets
and did some other shopping at the stores.       
       And when you returned it was       all over?       
Doctor Crawford looked gravely at her.
       Yes,        said Milly,        we were both away, and oh,
I am so glad! I couldn       t have stood it!       
She broke down and sobbed in her husband       s
arms, but Crawford went on asking questions.
       The autopsy will show,        he said,        but I will ask
if any of you can show cause to suspect that a
poison of any sort could have been administered to
the victims of this disaster.       
       Not possibly,        said Professor Hardwick.        We
were at tea, and had all been served from the same
teapot and from the same plates of cakes. I can
affirm this, for I       ve thought over every moment of
the occasion. Mr. Bruce had taken part of his tea,
and had eaten part of his cake,                     
       Are you sure of this?        the coroner interrupted.
       I am sure that he sat next to me, that he was
talking to me, and that he received his tea at the
same time I did. We sat stirring our cups, and
nibbling our cake as we discussed a matter in which
we were both interested. Less than a half minute
before that man died, he was as well as he had ever
been. The scene is perfectly before my eyes. He
held his cup and saucer in one hand, his spoon in
the other,       when I saw his eyes open queerly, his
face change to a clayey gray, and his fingers relaxed,
letting his cup fall to the floor. I set down my cup
quickly and sprang toward him, but in an instant it
was all over.       
[129]
A hush fell on the group as all remembered the
details, so exactly as the Professor had related them.
       And the young lady,        said Crawford, at last,
rousing himself from thought,        did she too drink
tea?       
       No,        said Eve Carnforth, musingly.        I remember
I was just fixing Vernie       s tea. She liked it
sweet, and I was adding a lump of sugar when the
commotion began.       
       I noticed Miss Reid first, I think,        offered
Tracy;        at least, I happened to look toward her
when Mr. Bruce fell forward in his chair. She
made a slight sound, as of horror, and when I
glanced her way, she looked so stunned I thought
she was going to collapse, so I stepped across toward
her. As I did so, she looked suddenly very strange,
and I feared she was ill,       aside from her shock at
sight of Mr. Bruce. I grasped her by the shoulders
just as she was about to fall. She cried out as if
in pain, and then Miss Carnforth came to my assistance,
and we laid the child on that sofa. In an instant,
she, too, was gone.       
       She had taken no tea?       
       No,        said Eve, positively.        Nor any cakes.
As a rule, the elders were served first and Vernie
last. So there is no chance of there having been
poison in the tea or cakes,       nor could it be possible,
anyway, as we all ate them,       didn       t we?       
[130]
Every one present affirmed that they had partaken
of the tea and the cakes, and declared they were
both harmless and just such as they had had served
every afternoon since their arrival.
       That settles that point, at any rate,        and the
coroner nodded his head.        There can be no question
of poison after what you       ve told me. Unless,
either or both of them took poison themselves or
gave it to the other intentionally.       
[131]
CHAPTER IX
Conflicting Theories
In the kitchen the discussion was going on in
less guarded terms.
       It       s murder,        Thorpe declared flatly.        No
spooks ever killed off those two people in a minute,
just like that!       
       Murder, your grandmother!        snorted Stebbins.
       Who done it, and how? I ask you that! Those
folks came up here to hunt ghosts, and I should say
they found        em, good and plenty! You know       s
well       s I do, this house has always been ha       nted,
ever since that woman killed her husband in
that very room where the little girl       s lyin        now. I
wouldn       t go in that there room for a fortune, I
wouldn       t!       
       Now Eli, don       t be foolish,        and Thorpe shook
his head.        How could a spook kill two folks at
onct,       right out in the open, as you may say?       
       For that matter, how could anybody murder
two people at once? Nobody was around but their
own crowd, and that lot of people ain       t for murderin       
each other! I know that!       
[132]
       It was spooks,        declared Hester, with an air of
settling the matter;        I       ve smelled        em of late. That
smell of bitter almonds is been in the air a heap,
and I ain       t had none for flavourin        or anything.
Land, I       d never flavour a cake with that! I put
vanilla even in my        Angel Food.              
       I       ve smelled it too,        spoke up Nannie, a helper
of the older woman       s;        when I       ve been a-dustin       
round in that there ha       nted room, I       ve smelled it       not
strong, you know, but jest a faint whiff,
now       n then. I skittled out        s fast       s I could, I kin
tell you!       
       Nope, you       re all wrong,        insisted old Thorpe.
              Tain       t spooks, it       s murder. That       s what it is.       
       Who done it, then?        demanded his wife.
       That I dunno. But I have my s       picions. How,       I
dunno, either. But that       s neither here nor
there. Murder       s been done, but I       ll bet that mutton-headed
Crawford ain       t got brains enough to
see it.       
       He ain       t got brains enough to go in when it
rains,        agreed Stebbins,        but you       re        way off,
Thorpe, a surmisin        murder. Why, jest f       r instance,
now, how could it        a        been done?       
       Now how can I tell that!        Thorpe spoke with
fine scorn.        I don       t know all the goin       s on of
them hifalutin folks, but if you       d heard        em talkin       
       s much as I have, you       d know that they       re up to
lots of things such as us ignorant people don       t
know nothin        about.       
[133]
       They do talk awful hifalutin,        corroborated
Hester.        I       ve heard        em say things that hadn       t no
meanin        whatsoever to me, and yet they was plain
English too.       
       Well, if you ask me,        and Thorpe looked important,
       I       d jest say keep your eye on one of them
women.       
       You mean that red-headed varmint, I know,       
said his wife.        Well, she       s a handful, all right, but
I don       t believe she       d go so far       s to kill anybody.       
       You don       t, don       t you? Well, she       d go just so
far as there was any goin        at all,       an        then she       d
go right on. Oh, I kin read character,        and Thorpe
plumed himself so evidently on his mental powers
that Stebbins snorted outright.
       You       re, a hummer, you are! I s       pose you       re
clairvoyant, yourself! Well, let me advise you to
keep your trap shut about Miss       that lady you referred
to. This is my house, and those are my
tenants, and I won       t stand any talk from you about
       em.       
       That       s right, Thorpe,        admonished his wife.
       Mr. Stebbins, he       s right. An        he       s right about the
ghosts, too. Why, I happen to know that the spooks
warned that little Reid girl she       d die at four o       clock,
and die she did, jest at four! Can you beat it?
Spooks? Why, of course it was spooks! What
else?       
       Yes, and the message was that two of        em        d
die, and two of        em did,        added Stebbins.        How
could any mortal human bein        bring that about? I
ask you?       
[134]
       Land! I don       t know! I told you I didn       t.
But,        and Thorpe wagged his head positively,        it
wasn       t spooks.       
The same questions were being discussed in the
hall by the ones more intimately interested.
Doctor Wayburn had arrived, and he and Crawford
were shut in the drawing room endeavouring
to wrest from the unknown, the secret of Gifford
Bruce       s death.
The little group, still gathered in the hall, were
talking earnestly of the immediate future.
       It       s so pathetic,        Norma was saying,        that
there are so few to mourn for poor little Vernie.
That child had actually no relatives but her uncle
and Mr. Braye.       
       Wynne is a sort of a cousin, too,        put in Milly,
       and indeed, Norma, I feel as sorry as if Vernie
had been my own sister.       
       Oh, I don       t mean that,       of course, we all feel
that way. But, she was so alone in the world.
Mr. Braye is terribly broken up. He loved
her                     
       Not only loved her,        said Eve,        but he was
ambitious for her. He wanted her put in care of
a capable woman this fall, and brought up properly.
Mr. Bruce was no sort of a guardian for the child       I
mean he was all right, of course, as a legal guardian,
but he was no man to have charge of her
social and home life.       
[135]
       He knew that,        said Landon,        he told me he
meant to have Vernie properly chaperoned and all
that, this winter. She was a dear kiddie.       
       Oh, she was,        and Norma wept afresh.
       I am a complete convert to spiritualism, now,       
said the Professor, gravely.        I       ve thought over
these things very deeply, I       ve considered every possible
aspect of the case, and there is no explanation
of those two mysterious deaths, except supernormal
forces. It is no use to shirk the supposition of
murder, indeed we must consider it very carefully,
but it is out of the question. Nobody could have
compassed those two deaths in an instant of time,
however secret or subtle the methods. Do you all
agree?       
       Of course,        said Eve, positively, and Tracy
added,        That is undeniable, Professor, foul play
was impossible. But, moreover, there was no one
here present but our own party. I can       t let the
implication pass that it could have been in the heart
of any one of us                     
       Nonsense!        interrupted Hardwick,        that       s absurd,
Mr. Tracy. When I speak of murder, it is in
the abstract, and because it is right that we should
consider the matter from every angle. We must
even think of suicide, and of                     
       Suicide is as absurd as murder,        said Landon,
indignantly.        But what other atrocity had you
in mind?       
[136]
       Don       t lose your temper, please,        the Professor
said, mildly.        I am obliged to preserve an impersonal
attitude, or I can       t think at all! The other
thought is, that one of the victims killed himself
and the other one.       
       Please, Professor,        said Eve,        at least confine
yourself to rational common sense. But since you
raise this absurd theory, let       s settle it once and for
all. Could Mr. Bruce have willingly killed himself
and Vernie?        she asked of them all.
       No!        replied Landon.        Mr. Bruce was fond
of life and he adored that child! Cut that out!       
       Then,        pursued Eve,        could Vernie have killed
herself and her uncle?       
       Rubbish!        cried Landon,        don       t say such
things, Eve. Professor, are you answered?       
       And remember,        put in Tracy,        the two were
the width of this hall apart. What means could
have been employed?       
       What means were employed, anyway?        said
Norma.        Oh, what did kill those people?       
       The utter absence of any material means proves
the fact that it was supernatural,        declared the Professor.
       I only mentioned those other theories to
prove their absurdity. Now, as I say, I am a convert
to spiritualism in all its form and phases. How
can one help being after this? And I, for one,
desire to stay here for a time and I feel sure that
the departed spirits of our friends will communicate
with us.       
Milly shuddered at the idea, but Eve       s wonderful
eyes glowed with a sudden anticipation.
[137]
       Oh, Professor Hardwick!        she exclaimed,
       how splendid! Will you really stay here a while?
Will you, Milly? I can       t stay unless you and
Wynne do. Will you stay, Norma? and you, Mr.
Tracy?       
       Oh, I can       t!        Milly moaned.        I needn       t,
need I, Wynne?       
       No; darling, not if you don       t want to. I can       t
see, Eve, why you wish to stay here. It gives me
the horrors to think of it. And if you really expect
spiritual communications from Vernie or Mr. Bruce,
you can receive them just as well anywhere else.       
       Not just as well,        demurred the Professor.
       The conditions here are ideal for investigations.
We haven       t taken it up seriously, you know.       
       But, Miss Carnforth, can       t you ask some other
friends to come, if the Landons prefer to return to
New York? I don       t doubt you know the right
ones, who could chaperon you, and also take an
interest in our work.       
       Yes,        began Eve, thoughtfully, and then Stebbins
came into the room.
       The doctors through yet?        he asked;        what
they found out?       
       No, they       re not through yet,        answered Landon.
       Sit down, Stebbins, and talk a little bit. I
wish you       d tell us of anything you know of your
own experience, not hearsay, mind you, that has
happened in this house, that can truly be called
supernatural.       
[138]
       Well, that ha       nted room,                     
       Wait a minute,        interrupted Landon,        don       t
tell us anything about that haunted room that you
don       t know, personally, to be a fact.       
       I know it       s ha       nted,        asserted Stebbins, doggedly.
       I       ve slept there and I       ve seen ghosts
spookin        around in it.       
       Do you think there are really such things as
ghosts?       
       I know it.       
       And do you think they could be responsible for
the death of Mr. Bruce and Miss Reid?       
       I know it. That Thorpe he says it       s murder,
but he can       t guess how it could be. That fool of
a Crawford, he don       t know nothing, of any sort.
Wayburn, now, he       s a fair doctor, but, good land!
what can they learn from a post-mortem? Those
people was warned, and them warnin       s was carried
out. What more is there to learn?       
       Well and clearly put, Mr. Stebbins,        commented
the Professor.        No elaboration of
phrases could state that more succinctly. They
were warned,       the warnings were carried out.
That is the whole truth.       
       But granting that,        said Norma,        and I       m
willing to grant it, why did the spirits want to kill
Vernie? A lovely, innocent child couldn       t have
incurred the wrath of the spirits to that extent.       
[139]
       They ain       t no tellin       , ma       am, what them ha       nts
will do.        Stebbins spoke heavily, as if burdened
with fear.        Now I leave it to you folks. Ain       t
you smelled prussic acid around?       
       I have,        said Norma.        And I,        added the
Professor.        I know it was not brought here by
any of our party                     
       Nor not by the cook,        said Stebbins.
       Hester, she       s leery of that bitter almond flavourin       
and she don       t never use it. Well, don       t that
smell prove somethin       ?       
       It isn       t actual proof,        and Tracy looked thoughtful.
       But it is an inexplicable odour to hang round
an old house.       
              Tain       t inexplicable if it       s due to the ha       nt,       
urged Stebbins.        And that       s what it is due to.
Why, that smell       s been said to be round here ever
since the time of the Montgomery murder.       
       What       s wrong between you and Doctor Crawford?       
asked Eve, suddenly.        You say yourself
you aren       t good friends.       
       No, ma       am, we ain       t. It       s a sort o        feud of
long standin       . They ain       t no special reason, jest a
conglomeration of little things. But one thing is
       cause he makes fun of the spooks here. He don       t
take no stock in such things, and nobody can make
him. Thorpe, now, he don       t neither. He sticks
to it Mr. Bruce and Miss Vernie was murdered.       
       By what means, does he think?        asked Eve,
quickly.
       Well, that he don       t know. But murder he says
it was, and that he sticks to, like a puppy to a root.       
[140]
       Get him in here,        said Landon, abruptly, and
Thorpe was summoned.
       Yes, sir,        the butler averred, on being questioned.
       I       m willin        to go on record as a disbeliever
in spooks. They ain       t no such things. I
don       t deny I       ve been some scared up hearin        you
ladies and gentlemen talk about such matters. But
I don       t believe in        em and I never will. Them two
pore critters was done to death, but I       m free to
confess I can       t see how.       
Professor Hardwick looked at the speaker.        As
Mr. Dooley observed,        he said,        your remarks is
inthrestin        but not convincin       . My man, if there is
no possible way that murder could have been done,       and
we in here are agreed on that point,       what is
left but the inevitability of supernormal agents?       
       Your long words gets me, sir, but it don       t make
no difference. It wa       n       t spooks.       
       He       s hopeless,        said Tracy.        Let       s ask him
other things. Thorpe, my man, have you never
seen any circumstance or occurrence in this house,
that you couldn       t explain by natural means?       
       I ain       t never been in this house, sir, except as
I came here to buttle for you folks. Mr. Stebbins,
he give the job to me and my wife,        cause we       re
honest, hard-working people, and he knew he could
trust us not to tattle or tell no tales of your goin       s
on. He says,        Thorpe,        says he,        they       re a queer
lot what       s comin        up here, but they       re my tenants,
and I don       t want        em bothered none by gossip and
tale-bearin        to the village.        Ain       t that right, Mr.
Stebbins?       
[141]
       Just so,        said Stebbins, calmly.        Them       s just
about my very words. You told me, Mr. Landon,
that you were a crowd of spook-hunters, and so it
was up to me to spare you all the annoyance I
could. An        well I know how the villagers gossip
about this here house, if they get a chance. So,
with the Thorpes at the head of things and a couple
of good close-mouthed girls for helpers, I        llowed
you       d not be troubled. And you ain       t been,       up to
now. But this thing can       t be kept quiet no longer.
Of course, a thing like this is more or less public
property, and I can tell you, there       ll be plenty of
curious villagers up here to the inquest and all
that.       
       Inquest!        cried Eve,        what do you mean?       
       Jest that, ma       am. That dunder-headed coroner,
or county physician as he really is, he       s set on
havin        an inquest,       says he       s got to. Well, I don       t
know much about law, but if they can ketch and
hang a ha       nt, let        em do it, say I!       
The arrival on the scene of the two doctors cut
short further discussion.        There is a strange condition
of things,        Crawford began, addressing himself
to Wynne Landon.        We find decisive, though
very slight evidence that Mr. Bruce died from
poison.       
A hush followed, as his stunned hearers thought
over the grave significance of this statement.
[142]
       Poison?        repeated Landon, dazedly.        What
sort of poison? Who administered it?       
       As I said,        resumed the coroner,        it       s a strange
case. The poison found is the minutest quantity
of a very powerful drug, known among the profession
as strychnine hydrochlorate. This is so
deadly that a half grain will kill a man instantly,
or in a few seconds. But my colleague and I have
agreed that since it is impossible for this to have
been administered at the moment of Mr. Bruce       s
death, it must be that he had taken it in cumulative
doses, and the result culminated in his sudden
death.       
       Why would he take it?        cried Milly.
       Where could he get it?        asked the Professor.
       Such a drug is not available to the general public,
is it?       
       It is not, sir, but whoever gave it to him, must
have procured it somehow. Those questions are
for the future. We are just learning the facts.
The results of our tests prove positively the presence
of that particular poison. There is no doubt
of that.       
       But wait,        and Eve fixed her compelling eyes
on the coroner       s face.        Remember, Doctor Crawford,
though you may not believe in the occult,
other and wiser minds do. I wish to remind you,
therefore, that we who believe these deaths were
caused by supernatural agency, believe also that the
powers that compassed the deaths are able to make
the deaths seem attributable to natural causes,
whether poison or anything else.       
[143]
       Eve!        exclaimed Milly,        that is going too
far!       
       Not at all!        said the Professor.        Miss Carnforth
is quite right; and indeed, logic must prove
that if a phantasm can take away a human life it
can also produce effects that resemble conditions
brought about by human means.       
       I repeat,        the coroner interrupted,        these
things are beside the question. We are conducting
an autopsy, not an inquest, at present. I am giving
you my report as a medical man, not as a member
of the police force. Those other matters will be
considered later. We have completed our examinations
in the one case, we will now proceed to
the case of the other victim.       
       They killed each other,        Thorpe broke in, nodding
his head in the positive manner he affected.
       Leastwise, one of        em killed both; and of course,
Miss Vernie, she wasn       t no murderer!       
       Wait till you are called upon to testify, my
man,        and Crawford glowered at the forwardness
of the old butler.
       There       ll be testifyin        on both sides,        volunteered
Stebbins, speaking a little belligerently.
[144]
Crawford turned on him, and it was easily seen
that enmity existed between these two.        You,
       Lijah Stebbins, keep quiet,        he admonished,
       there       s them that says you know too much about
these doings, anyhow.       
       What do you mean by that?        Stebbins        eyes
glowed with anger.
       Nothing now, and maybe nothing at any time.
But you       d better lie low. You might be unduly
suspected of ha       nting your own house!       
To the surprise of all present, Stebbins turned a
chalky white, and whimpered a little, as he said,
       I don       t know what you mean,       I ain       t done anything.       
       See       s you don       t!        advised Crawford, enigmatically,
and then the two doctors started to go on their
second gruesome errand.
       This door       s locked,        announced Doctor Wayburn,
trying to gain entrance to the Room with the
Tassels.
       I have the key,        said Eve Carnforth, slowly,
and, with a white face, she offered it to the men.
       What are you doing with it?        asked Landon,
in amazement.
       I d-don       t know,        and Eve showed great nervousness.
       I think I feared some one would go in
there.       
The others looked at her curiously, for the white
face was pallid and the scarlet line of her lips was
thin and straight.
An exclamation from Doctor Wayburn claimed
their attention, and speaking from the doorway of
the Room with the Tassels, he said:
[145]
       There is no body here.       
       What!        cried several at once, and crowded to
the door.
       Absolutely none,        repeated the doctor, and Professor
Hardwick pushed his way past the two medical
men and entered the room.
       It       s gone!        he said, reappearing,        Vernie       s
body is gone!       
       Impossible!        cried Landon,        what do you
mean? Why, we       ve all been right here all the
morning! How could it be gone?       
       See for yourself,        and Hardwick stepped aside.
There was no denying the fact. Scrutiny of the
whole room showed no presence of the cold, still
form that had been reverently laid on that bed.
Everybody entered and peered around, fruitlessly.
They shook the heavy hangings and looked behind
them, but to no avail.
Vernie       s body had utterly disappeared!
[146]
CHAPTER X
Was It Supernatural?
Late that afternoon Braye returned from New
York. He looked weary and exhausted, as
if under hard and continuous strain.
Norma and Eve had both been watching for him
from different windows and met on the stairs in
their sudden rush to meet him in the hall.
It was easily apparent that both girls desired to
see him first and tell him the further awful development
of the disappearance of Vernie       s body.
       What!        he exclaimed,        more horrors! Wait
a minute, till I get off this dust coat.       
Before Eve or Norma could say more, the others,
hearing Braye, came trooping to the hall, and all
began to talk at once.
       I can       t understand                      and Braye wearily
passed his hand across his brow,              tell me all that
happened after I left last evening.       
       Nothing especial,        said Tracy, quietly.        We
all went to bed early, at least, we went to our rooms.
Professor Hardwick and I sat up half the night,
talking. But we left Thorpe on guard in the hall
here, and of course, it never occurred to any of us
there was need of further precaution.       
[147]
       Nor was there,        said Eve, fixing her great eyes
on Braye.        Nobody could possibly come in from
outside and take that child away. The house is too
securely locked for that, as we all know.       
       Why should any one want to?        queried Braye,
his face blank with amazement.
       No one did want to,       no one did do it,        returned
Eve.        You must admit, Rudolph, that the
whole thing is supernatural,       that                     
       No, Eve, I can       t do that.        Braye spoke positively.
       When I       m up here with you psychists,
and in this atmosphere of mystery,       and Lord
knows        Black Aspens        is mysterious!       I get
swayed over toward spiritualism, but when I go
down to the city and talk with rational, hard-headed
men, I realize there       s nothing in this poppycock!       
       Oh, you do!        and Eve       s penetrating glance
seemed to bore into his very soul,        then, pray, how
do you explain the fact that Vernie       isn       t there?       
       I don       t know, Eve,       I don       t know. But some
fiend in human shape must have managed to get into
the house                     
       And get out again?        said Tracy,        and carry
the body with him,       when Thorpe sat right here in
the hall                     
       Where was Thorpe?        asked Braye, suddenly.
       In a chair there, by that table,        and Eve indicated
a position well back in the great hall.
[148]
       Then he couldn       t see the doors of both
rooms                      began Braye, but Professor Hardwick
interrupted:        Nonsense, man, both doors were
open, if any move had been made, Thorpe must
have heard it.       
       Both doors open,        said Braye,        Norma, you
said they were closed when you came down to
breakfast.       
       I asked Thorpe about that,        said Tracy.        He
told me that at daybreak, or soon after, he closed
the doors, without looking in the rooms. He was
scared, I think, though he won       t admit that. He
says, he thought the ladies would be coming down
and the doors better be closed.       
       That       s all right, but it       s strange that he didn       t
glance into the rooms.       
       I don       t think so,        said Landon.        Thorpe was
in charge, but he had no reason to think there had
been any disturbance, and he is pretty well scared
up over the whole matter. And I don       t wonder.       
       Nor I,        said Braye.        It       s all inexplicable.
What       s Crawford going to do next?       
       I       m not sure,        said Tracy,        but I think he       ll
hold an inquest. Of course, he thinks it       s a case of
murder                     
       How absurd!        cried Eve.        What more does
the man want in confirmation of the supernatural?
First, those two deaths, impossible of human
achievement, and now, the taking away of poor little
Vernie, in circumstances that deny any mortal hand
in the matter!       
[149]
       If that       s true, Eve,        Braye spoke in a matter-of-fact
tone,        it will do no harm to let the coroner
proceed along his own lines. He can       t convict a
murderer if there isn       t one,       and if there is one, we
all want him convicted, don       t we?       
       Of course,        said Landon,        but suppose they
pitch on an innocent man?       
       It       s all supposition,        declared Braye.        I never
heard of such a moil! I can       t see how it can be
murder, or body-snatching, yet I can       t stand for
ghost-work, either. Say it       s murder,       where       s a
motive, for anybody?       
       I think you ought to know, Rudolph,        Eve said,
slowly,        that that Crawford person asked who
would inherit Mr. Bruce       s money, and                     
       And we owned up that you were the next of
kin, old chap,        put in Landon, smiling grimly.
       Any remarks?       
       Don       t be flippant, Wynne,        said Braye, seriously,
       of course, I       ve thought of that. I can       t
very well be charged with the murder, as I wasn       t
here at the time, but I do feel deeply embarrassed
at the thought that I am, without a doubt, the next
heir. That can, I suppose, draw suspicion on me,
as I may be said to have motive. But I am not
afraid of that, for there       s no possible way I could
have turned the trick. But, if it was murder, if
there       s the slightest indication of foul play, I       m
ready to devote all of Uncle Gifford       s money, if
need be, in bringing the criminal to justice.       
[150]
       Of course, there       s no sense in tacking the crime
on you, Braye,        and Landon sighed.        If it was
a crime, and if anybody here committed it, they       ll
more likely suspect me, for I       m the next heir after
you, and if I could despatch two intervening heirs,
I could also bump you off, I suppose.       
       Don       t talk like that, Wynne,        implored Milly.
       It       s not like you, and I                     
       I       m only preparing you, Milly, dear, for what
may come. That mutton-headed coroner can       t rest
till he fastens murder on somebody,       and it might
as well be me.       
       I want to go home, Wynne,       I want to go back
to New York,        and Milly began to cry.
       You may, dear, just as soon as you like. But
I must stay and see what happens up here. For me
to run away would be, to say the least, suspicious.       
       Talk sense, Wynne,        broke in Braye;        I wasn       t
here, you know, when those two people died. Tell
me again, just where were you all?       
       Mr. Bruce and Professor Hardwick sat in those
two chairs, confabbing,        Wynne explained;        I was
passing things round, so was Mr. Tracy. Eve was
running the tea things, Vernie was jumping about
here and there, and Norma,       where were you,
Norma?       
       I was near Mr. Bruce and the Professor, listening
to their talk,        she returned.        I was greatly
interested. Mr. Landon had just given me a cup of
tea, and I was sipping it as I listened. There was
nothing wrong about the tea, of that I       m certain.       
[151]
       Of course there wasn       t,        agreed Braye, who had
heard the scene rehearsed many times.        There       s
nothing wrong anywhere, that I can see, except that
a dreadful thing has happened, and we must find
out all we can about it. I       ve been to see Uncle
Gif       s business friends, he has a few in New York,
and they       re flabbergasted, of course. One of them,
a Mr. Jennings, is sure it       s a desperate murder,
cleverly contrived by some people in Chicago, who
are enemies of Uncle       s, and who, he says, are diabolically
ingenious enough to have brought it about.
He holds that Vernie       s death was accidental,       I
mean that they only intended to kill Uncle Gifford.
I can       t believe in this talk, for how could it have
been brought about? But Jennings thinks it was
through the servants,       and that they       re really enemies
in disguise.       
       Why, they       re all natives of this section,        exclaimed
the Professor,        how could they be implicated?       
       I told Jennings that, but he thinks they       ve been
bought over, or       oh, Lord, I don       t know what he
thinks! I don       t know what to think myself!
There       s no solution!       
       Don       t think now, Rudolph,        and Eve came over
to his side, and took his hand in hers.        You       re
all tired out, and I don       t wonder. Let       s have tea,       we
mustn       t dread tea because of its associations,       if
we do that, we       ll all collapse.       
[152]
With a determined air, Eve went away to order
tea served as usual, though Milly had declared she
never wanted to have it in that hall again.
But Eve       s idea found favour with the rest, and
they gratefully accepted the refreshment, which,
until that awful afternoon, had been such a pleasant
function.
       We must settle some things,        Braye said, looking
at Landon.        I arranged to send the bodies to
Chicago,       of course, I didn       t know                     
       Isn       t it terrible!        exclaimed Norma.        What
shall you do now?       
       I think I       ll send Uncle Gif       s body, at once, and
hope to find Vernie       s later. It must be found                     
Braye looked about wildly.        I wish I had been
here last night! Oh, forgive me, I       m not casting
any hint of blame on you others, but,       well, you
know I wasn       t here when       when it happened, either,
and I can       t sense it all as you do. Professor Hardwick,
what do you think about it all?       
       I       m an old man, Braye, and I       ve had wide experience,
also, I       m a hard one to convince without
strong and definite proof, but I       ll state now, once
for all, that I       m a complete convert to spiritism and
I believe,       I know,       these deaths of our friends
were the acts of an inimical spirit, a phantasm, incensed
at our curiosity concerning the occult, and
our frivolous attitude toward the whole subject.       
       You really believe that, Professor?       
[153]
       I really do, Braye, and moreover I am convinced
that the disappearance of       of little Vernie,
is the work of the evil spirit. What else can
explain it?       
       Nothing that I know of, but I can       t swallow
the idea of a disembodied spirit making off with a
real, material body! I wish I       d been here! Didn       t
anybody see or hear anything?       
       No,        declared Landon, but Norma gave a quick
glance at Eve, who returned it with a defiant toss
of her Titian-coloured head.
       Why do you look at me like that, Norma?       
she asked, shortly.
       Why do I?        Norma repeated in a soft significant
tone.        I think you know, Eve.       
       Well, I for one, shall stay up here for a time,
and see how matters go on,        said Braye, with
sudden determination.        Who else wants to
stay?       
       I do,        said Professor Hardwick,        I think we       ve
by no means seen the last of the manifestations, and
though I feel there is a danger, I am ready to
brave it for the sake of investigating further.       
       I don       t want to stay,        and Milly shook with
nervous apprehension.        Can       t we go home,
Wynne?       
       Very soon, darling. You can go at once, and
I       ll follow as soon as things are adjusted up here.
I think none of us ought to seem to run away.       
       Certainly not,        Tracy agreed, promptly.        The
whole affair is so astounding, I can scarcely get my
wits together, but I see clearly, no one must leave
this house, until we are all exonerated from suspicion.       
[154]
       Not even me?        asked Milly, tearfully.
       That       s for you and Mr. Landon to decide,       
returned Tracy, gently.        I       m not dictating, not
even advising, but I have strong opinions on the
subject. What say, Braye?       
       I quite agree with you, Tracy. But, I       m sure
if Mrs. Landon prefers to go down to New York
and stay at her mother       s no one could possibly
object.       
       But I don       t!        Milly surprised them all by saying,
       if you put it that way,       if it       s cowardly to
go away, I don       t want to go. I want to stay, if
Wynne does, and if Eve and Norma stay.       
       That       s my brave girl,        and Landon smiled at
his wife;        I       ll guarantee that Milly won       t make
any trouble, either. Once she       s awake to a duty,
she       s bold as a lion. Now, see here, if Crawford
stirs up suspicion of any of us, we       ll have to deal
with him pretty roughly, I fear. He       s a pig-headed
sort, and he will move heaven and earth to gain his
point. Moreover, we can       t expect him to subscribe
to spook theories, any more than those men Rudolph
talked to in New York. One has to go
through some such experiences as we have, to believe
in them. You, Professor, would never have
been convinced by hearsay evidence, would you?       
[155]
       No, sir, I would not! It took these otherwise
inexplicable happenings to prove to me that there
is but one way to look. Even a coroner can       t produce
a human criminal who could kill those two
people the way they were killed, and who could
get into and out of this house and take a human
body with him! The thing is preposterous!       
       You know the doors and windows were all
locked?        asked Braye, thoughtfully.
       I looked after them, myself,        said Landon.        I
always do. After the last one goes upstairs for the
night, I invariably look after the locking up. And
the house, properly locked, is impregnable. The
servants        quarters are shut off and locked; there is
absolutely no way of getting in from outside.       
       Going back to Jennings        theory,        mused Braye,
       could we suspect old Thorpe?       
       Not for a minute,        declared Landon.        And,
too, he wasn       t in the hall when they died. No, I       d
trust Thorpe as far as I would any of ourselves.
But, there       s Stebbins. I       ve never felt sure that he       s
entirely trustworthy.       
       Even so,        said Braye,        he wasn       t here when       when
they died.       
       No, he wasn       t. I can       t see any way he could
have arranged things unless he poisoned the
cake                     
       Rubbish, Wynne!        cried Eve,        you know we
all ate that cake. Do be rational.       
       But Mr. Bruce was poisoned, Eve, we can       t get
away from that.       
[156]
       Of course he was,        broke in Hardwick,        and
doubtless Vernie was too, but it was not done by
human agency.       
       Well, there we go, reasoning round in a circle,       
murmured Norma;        I think our talk is useless,
when we surmise and speculate about it all. Let
us decide on our immediate plans. Shall you send
Mr. Bruce       s body to Chicago, and stay here yourself,
Rudolph?       
       Yes, as I look at it now. I can       t see anything
else to do.       
Nor was there anything else to do.
For Doctor Crawford persisted in treating the
case as a criminal one, and requested that all concerned
remain at Black Aspens for the present, with
a hint that unless they did so, the request might become
a command.
       Then you think the two people were murdered?       
asked Landon of the county physician.
       I don       t say that, for sure; but when a man
drops dead, and a trace of poison is found in his
stomach, it looks mighty like an intention of death
on some one       s part,       maybe the man himself.
There       s a show of suicide, you know.       
       But Gifford Bruce never would commit suicide!       
       If only those committed suicide who are expected
to do so, there       d be mighty few of them.
Now, I hold that poison was taken into Mr. Bruce       s
stomach while he was eating that cake, or whatever
he did eat.       
[157]
       We agree to that,        Landon spoke slowly,        but
some of us think the poison was put in by supernatural
means.       
       Now, ain       t that nonsense,       for reasonable,
rational men!        and Crawford       s fine scorn nettled
Landon.
       Professor Hardwick doesn       t think it nonsense,       
he returned.
The two were alone, Crawford having asked an
interview with the man who had rented the house.
       Professor!        and Crawford fairly snorted.
       For fool theories, commend me to a college professor.
They can       t see two inches either side of
their noses!       
       We have had reason to believe in spiritual
manifestations,        went on Braye.
       Yes, and who gave you those reasons? Who
rented this house to you folks, for the sole purpose
of supplying you with a ha       nted house! Who knew
that ghosts must be forthcoming, if you folks was
to be satisfied? Who performed ghost doings himself,
in order that you might not be disappointed?       
       What are you implying? That Mr.       that the
owner tricked us?       
       That       s for you to find out. You came up here
to investigate, as I understand it. Well, why don       t
you investigate? You swallow all them ghosts and
ha       ntings, and never look around to see who       s fooling
you!       
[158]
       But, Doctor Crawford, what you insinuate is
not possible. All the strange things we have seen
or heard have occurred at night, or,       yes,       occasionally
in the daytime, but always when Mr. Stebbins
was at his home in East Dryden.       
       How do you know he was?       
       Why, he has never been to the house at all,
except two or three times on commonplace errands,
since we       ve been here. The supernatural manifestations
we have observed had no more to do with
him than they had with you!       
       That       s as may be. Only I advise you to investigate
with a little common sense and not too much
blind faith in your spook visitors. Now, Mr. Landon,
I take it you       re boss around here.       
       I       m responsible for the house rent, if that       s
what you mean.       
       Well, that       ll do. Now, sir, there       s got to be an
inquest. I expected, of course, to hold it on the
two bodies, but since one       s gone, we       ll have to do
what we can without it. I don       t deny that this case
is beyond all my experience. I       ve sent for a detective
from New York, and I       ll get all the other help
I need. But I       m all at sea, myself, and I make no
secret of that.       
       I thought you suspected Eli Stebbins.       
       Not of murder! No, sir! Me       n Eli, we ain       t
good friends, haven       t been for years, and I wouldn       t
put it past him to play ghost to scare you city people,
but murder! Land, no, I wouldn       t ever accuse Eli
Stebbins of goin        that far!       
[159]
       Have you any definite suspect?       
       I don       t say as I have, and I don       t say as I ain       t.
Truth is, I       m all afloat. I don       t know which way to
turn. Every thing       s so awful unbelievable,       as you
might say. Now, there       s them two Thorpes. Good,
steady-going New England people, they are, and
yet, if I had any reason to suspect        em, I can see
myself doing so. But, land, there ain       t a shred of
evidence that way. Why, they wasn       t even in the
room when the two of        em died!       
       Wait a minute, Doctor Crawford. Nobody
was in the room at the time of those two deaths, but
our own party. You don       t suspect one of us, do
you?       
       No, Mr. Landon, I don       t. You ain       t a gay
crowd, nor yet a fast or a common crowd. You       re
all high-toned, quiet, law-abiding citizens,       as I
size you up. To be sure, decent citizens have committed
murder, but I can       t connect up any one of
you with crime in this case. I know Mr. Braye
will inherit the money that old Mr. Bruce left, and
I know that you       re related there, too, but I haven       t
seen one iota of reason to suspect any one of your
crowd. If I do, I       ll let you know mighty quick!
Nor can I hang it on the Thorpes; nor yet on those
girls they have in to help. And that       s what the inquest       s
for. To bring out, if possible, some evidence
against somebody, so       s we can get a start.       
[160]
       I fear you can       t get that evidence, Doctor, for
if there were any we would have found it ourselves.
You have my good wishes, for if it is a case of
murder, committed by a living, human villain, we
most assuredly want him apprehended.       
       He will be, Mr. Landon, take it from me, he
will be!       
[161]
CHAPTER XI
The Heir Speaks Out
The days that followed were like an awful
nightmare to the people most interested.
But at last the inquest was over, the body
of Gifford Bruce had been sent to Chicago for
burial, and a strange quiet had settled down upon
the household at Black Aspens.
No new facts had transpired at the inquest.
Though the police tried hard to fasten the crime
on some individual, there was no definite evidence
against any one. All those who had been present
at the mysterious death hour, told their stories
straightforwardly and unshakably. All agreed as
to the circumstances, all remembered and related the
story of the Ouija board, which foretold the death
of two of the party at four o       clock.
       Who was pushing that board?        the coroner
asked.
[162]
       Miss Reid and myself,        Tracy spoke up.        We
had been playing with it for some time, and having
had only uninteresting and trifling results we were
about to lay the thing aside, when the message came
that two of us would die the next day at four
o       clock. Miss Reid seemed frightened, but I
thought at the time she had spelled out the message,
herself, to get up a little excitement. However, I
took the board away from her at once, feeling that
she was carrying a jest too far. I think now, that
she was innocent in the matter                     
       Well, I don       t,        said the coroner.        If that girl
made up that message, she had a reason. Probably
she was responsible for both deaths.       
       Impossible!        cried Tracy, shocked at this
theory.        Why, she was but a child, she had no
thought of suicide or       or murder! If she faked
the message, it was merely in fun, and because she
had tried all evening to get some message of interest.
It is quite possible she made up the message,
but it is not possible that she did it otherwise than
as a jest.       
       A gruesome jest!       
       As it turned out, yes, indeed. But either it
was in jest,       or       the message was from a supernatural
source.       
Tracy       s eyes were deeply sorrowful, and his face
expressed a sort of awed wonder, that made many
who were present, think that after all there might
be something in these occult beliefs.
But not so the coroner. He refused to consider
the Ouija message with any serious interest, and
continued to ply his witnesses with questions both
pertinent and wide of the mark.
[163]
Elijah Stebbins was put through a grilling inquiry.
His manner was that of a guilty man, but
no proof of crime could be found in connection with
him. The day and hour of the two deaths, he was
proved to have been at his home in East Dryden,
beyond all doubt. Even granting that the Thorpes,
one or both, were in his employ, there was no
reason to suspect them. If they had put poison in
the cakes or in the tea, it must have been done in
the kitchen, and therefore would have affected the
whole supply. Suspicion must fall, if anywhere,
on the members of the house party who were present
at the hour of four o       clock on the fatal day.
But these, as has been said, gave so clear a statement
of the actual happenings at that hour, that
there was no loophole for suspicion to enter. Moreover,
the fact that the deaths occurred simultaneously,
and just at the foretold hour, seemed to preclude
all possibility of any human means being
employed. It did look like a supernatural occurrence
and many who would have scorned such a
belief, were inevitably led to agree that no other
theory could explain it.
Yet the coroner and his jury were unwilling to
admit this, and the verdict was the one most frequently
heard of, murder by a person or persons
unknown.
[164]
Indeed, what else could it have been? A coroner       s
jury can       t accuse a nameless ghost of two
murders, by poison. They pinned their faith to
that poison, discovered in the stomach of the body
of Gifford Bruce. They assumed that Miss Reid
died from the effects of the same poison, but how
administered or by whom, or what had become of
the body of Miss Reid, they had no idea. But of
one thing they were sure, that all these things, and
all parts of the complicated crime, were the work
of human hands and human intelligence, and that
for the reputation of their village and their county
and their state, the murderer must be discovered
and brought to justice.
But how? How find a criminal who gave no
signs of existence, and who was, by those most
closely concerned, denied actual existence?
The detective, one Dan Peterson, proceeded on
the theory that a closed mouth implies great secret
wisdom. He said little, save to ask questions of
everybody with whom he came in contact, and as
these questions merely carried him round in a circle
back to his starting point, he made little progress.
There were also, of course, many reporters, from
the city papers, and these wrote up the story as
their natures or their chiefs dictated. Some played
up the supernatural side for all it was worth, and
more; others scorned such foolishness, and treated
the affair as a desperate and unusually mysterious
murder case. But all agreed that it was the most
sensational and interesting affair of its sort that had
happened in years, and the eager reporters hung
around and nearly drove frantic the feminine members
of the house party.
[165]
At last, Norma and Milly refused to see them, but
Eve Carnforth continued to talk with them, and imbued
many of them, more or less, with her occult
views.
       There       s something in what that red-headed
woman says,        one reporter opined to his fellow.
       She puts it mighty convincing,       if you ask me.       
       Yes, and why?        jeered his friend,        because
she       s the man behind the ghost!       
       What! Miss Carnforth! Guilty? Never!       
       I       m not so sure. You know as well as I do,
that spook talk is all rubbish, but she       s so bent and
determined to stuff it down everybody       s neck, I
think she       s hiding her own hand in the matter.       
       You do! Well, you       d better think again, before
you let out any such yarn as that! Why, she       s
a queen, that woman is!       
       Oho! She       s subjugated you, has she? Well,
look out that she doesn       t convert you to spookism,       you       d
lose your job!       
Other curious people journeyed up to Black
Aspens for the pleasure of looking at the house
where the mystery was staged. If allowed to
enter they walked about, open-mouthed in admiration
or wonder.
       Stunning hall!        exclaimed one young man, a
budding architect, who examined the old house with
interest.        Look at those bronze columns! I never
saw such a pair.       
[166]
       I       ve heard the first Montgomery brought those
from Italy or somewhere, and put up a house behind
       em,        volunteered another sightseer.        Ain       t it
queer, the way they       re half in and half out of the
front wall? Land! You wouldn       t know whether
you was going to school or coming home!        and the
speaker laughed heartily at his own wit.
But at last, the sightseers were refused admittance
to the house, and the remaining members of
the party gathered in conclave to decide on future
plans.
Professor Hardwick was the one who showed the
calmest demeanour.
       If there was a chance of a human being having
committed these crimes,        he said,        I       d be the first
one to want to track him down, and send him
straight to the chair. But nobody who has thought
about the matter can present any theory that will
account for the human element in the cause of the
tragedy. Therefore, feeling certain, as I do, that
our friends were killed by supernatural influences,
I am ready to stay here a short time longer, in
hopes of convincing the authorities up here that we
are right. Moreover, I planned to stay here a
month, and we       ve been here but little more than a
fortnight.       
       I       m willing to stay for the same reason, Professor,       
and Eve Carnforth       s strange eyes glowed
deeply.        I too, know that no living beings brought
about the deaths of Mr. Bruce and little Vernie, and
I will stay the rest of our proposed month, if the
others will.       
[167]
       I am ready to stay,        said Milly Landon, quietly.
       I       ve gotten all over my hysterical, foolish fears,
and I want to stay. I have a good reason, and if
I hadn       t, I       d be willing to stay to keep house for
the rest of you.       
       Let       s consider it settled, then,        said Landon,
       that we stay a couple of weeks longer. The astute
detective, Mr. Peterson, thinks he can round up the
villains who did the awful things, and if he can, I       m
ready to appear against them.       
       We       re all ready to do that,        agreed Mr. Tracy,
       and I       ll stay a week or so, but I want to get away
by the middle of August.       
       That       s nearly two weeks hence,        observed
Norma,        I       d like to go home about that time, too.
And all that       s to be discovered, which, I suppose,
will be nothing, ought to be found out in that time.       
       It wouldn       t surprise me to have some further
spiritual manifestations,        the Professor stated, with
a deeply thoughtful air.        I don       t know why there
wouldn       t be such.       
       Not with fatal results, I hope,        and Mr. Tracy
shuddered.
       I hope not, too,        and the Professor looked
grave.        But if we receive another warning, I
shall go home at once.       
       I don       t think we will,        Eve said,        I think there
was a reason for the wrath of the phantasms, and
now that wrath is appeased. We must not provoke
it further.       
[168]
       You know,        Norma added,        the two who       who
died, were scoffers at the idea of spiritual
visitations.       
       Uncle Gif was,        said Braye,        but little Vernie
wasn       t.       
       Oh, yes, she was,        corrected Eve.        She made
fun of our beliefs all along. And if she really made
the Ouija write that message in a spirit of bravado,
it       s small wonder that the vengeance reached her
as well as Mr. Bruce, who openly jeered at it
all.       
       I can       t think it,        mused Tracy,        that sweet, lovable
child,       full of mischief, of course, but simple,
harmless mischief,                     
       But, Mr. Tracy,        Norma looked and spoke positively,
       it       s easier to think of a supernatural spirit
wanting to harm the child, than a living person!
What possible cause could a human being have to
wish harm to little Vernie Reid?       
       That       s true, Miss Cameron. But it       s inexplicable,
however you look at it.       
       At the same time,        Braye argued,        we must
give both sides a chance. If there is any trick or
scheme that a man might have used to bring about
those deaths at that moment,       I can       t conceive of
any, but if there should have been such,       we must,
of course, give all possible assistance to Mr. Peterson
in his search.       
[169]
       I       m more than willing,        said Tracy,        I       m
anxious to help him for, as you say, Braye, if there       s
a human mind capable of devising means to commit
such a crime, it surely ought to be within the province
of some other human mind to discover it.       
       Suppose we start out on that basis,        suggested
Braye.        I mean, assume that a live person did
the deed, and it       s up to us to find him. Then if we
can       t do it, fall back on our occult theories.       
       I know where I       d look first,        said Landon,
grimly.
       Where?       
       Toward Eli Stebbins. I       ve always thought he
or the Thorpes, or all of them together, know more
than we suspect they do. Why, think a minute.
Do you remember the first queer, inexplicable thing
that happened up here?       
       I do,        Eve spoke up.        It was the night we
arrived. That battered old candlestick moved itself
from Mr. Bruce       s room to Vernie       s.       
       Yes, Eve, that       s what I have in mind. Well, I
thought then, and I think now, that Stebbins moved
that thing himself.       
       Why?        asked several voices at once.
       I thought I saw him sneaking across the hall
that night. And as you know, none of us would
have done it, and I don       t think Mr. Bruce did. I
thought that at first, but since Mr. Bruce       s death, I
know he never played any tricks on us.       
       Oh, that doesn       t follow,        objected Hardwick.
       I always suspected Bruce would trick us if he
could, but when it came to his own death, I       ve no
notion that he compassed that!       
[170]
       No,        agreed Braye,        whatever the truth may
be, there was no suicide.       
And so they talked, discussed, surmised, argued
and theorized, without getting any nearer a positive
belief, or proof of any sort to uphold their
opinions.
Each seemed to have marked out a certain line of
thought and doggedly stuck to it.
Professor Hardwick was, perhaps, the one
most positive regarding supernatural causes,
though Eve and Norma were almost equally
certain.
Braye and Landon were not entirely willing to
accept these beliefs, but confessed they had no
plausible substitutes to suggest. Tracy, as a clergyman,
was loth to accept what seemed to him heathen
ideas, but he was more or less influenced by the
talk of the Professor and of Eve Carnforth, who
was exceedingly persuasive in manner and argument.
Milly had little thought of her own about the
matter, but was always ready to believe as her husband
did, though, she, too, was swayed by the
strong statements and declarations of Eve Carnforth.
But Dan Peterson paid no more heed to ghost
lore of any sort or kind than as if the words had
not been spoken. Miss Carnforth       s glib recital of
wonders she knew to be true, Miss Cameron       s quiet
statements that she vouched for as facts, the Professor       s
irascible arguments, all were as nothing to
the practical, hard-headed detective.
[171]
       No, ma       am,        he said to Eve;        it ain       t that I
doubt your word, but those things don       t go down.
I       ve seen criminals before, try to get out by blaming
ghosts, but they couldn       t put it over.       
       Are you implying that one of us may be
guilty!        cried Eve, really incensed at the thought.
       I       m not implying anything, ma       am. I       m investigating.
When I find out anything, I       ll accuse, I
won       t imply.       
The man       s personality was not unpleasant. Of a
commonplace type, he went about his business cheerfully,
and in a practical, common sense fashion.
He examined the great hall, where the deaths had
occurred, for a possible secret entrance.
       Nothing doing,        was his sum-up of this investigation.
       That mahogany wall of the vestibule is
as solid as a rock, and nobody could get through
those bronze doors when they       re locked and fastened
with those bolts!       
       Are you assuming that some one entered and
killed the victims, as we all sat round drinking
tea?        exclaimed the Professor, irascibly.
       Not just that, sir,        returned Peterson, gravely.
       But somebody might have entered in the night,
say, and secreted himself,                     
       And then appeared to poison the cake when we
weren       t looking!        jeered London.
[172]
       Well,        and the detective looked a little sheepish,
       I got to consider all points, you know. And
there don       t seem to be any clues       of any sort.       
       No,        said Braye,        no dropped handkerchief or
broken cuff-link. Those would be a help, wouldn       t
they?       
       And then,        Landon went on,        usually, there       s
somebody who had a quarrel with the victim, and
so, can be duly suspected. But there       s nothing of
that sort in this case.       
       Nobody at odds with Mr. Bruce, wasn       t there?       
asked the detective, hopefully.
       Nobody,        declared Landon.        Now you may
as well know all there is to know, Peterson. Mr.
Braye here, is the heir to Mr. Bruce       s large fortune.
After him, I inherit. If these facts are of the nature
of straws to show you which way the wind
blows, make the most of them. But do it openly.
If you suspect Mr. Braye or myself, even in the
slightest degree, tell us so. Don       t work behind our
backs. We       re ready and willing to help you.
That       s so, Braye?       
[173]
       Rather, Wynne! Moreover, if there       s any way
to use it, the fortune of Uncle Bruce is at the disposal
of anybody who can bring the criminal to justice.
I don       t want the money,       at least, I can       t
enjoy it, and don       t want it, considering the way it
has come to me. I shall endow a hospital or something
with it. For, truly,       I may be foolish, but I
can       t seem to see myself living luxuriously on money
that has come to me as this has. I don       t wonder
that to an outsider, it might look very much as
if I had removed these two people in order that I
might acquire riches, or, it would have looked so,
if I had been here at the time. I doubt if the most
fertile imagination can invent a way I could have
been the criminal when I was in East Dryden shopping
with Mrs. Landon.       
       Also, Mr. Peterson,        Landon resumed,        remember
that I am the next to inherit, and if I could
have compassed the taking off of these two, I could
doubtless have later despatched Mr. Braye, and so
have come into the fortune myself.       
       Wynne,        pleaded Milly,        don       t say those
things! They       re too absurd!       
       Not that, Milly dear. Mr. Peterson might easily
take up some such line of deduction, and while
I       m willing he should do so, and proceed in any
way he chooses, I repeat that I want him to do it
openly, and not try to convict Rudolph or myself,
behind our backs. When I proffer him my help, it
is in a real and sincere offer of assistance, and I
want him to be equally frank and outspoken.       
       I guess you       re pretty safe in your attitude,        said
Peterson, smiling.        Criminals don       t speak right
out in meeting, like that. And I don       t suspect you
gentlemen, if you are heirs to the property. I think
there       s others to be suspected, and I promise you,
sir, if I       m led toward any of your party here, I       ll
tell you what I       m up to.       
[174]
       That       s enough, Peterson, I trust you to keep
your word, and you may rely on us to help in any
way we can.       
And so life at Black Aspens settled down to its
former routine, at least in matters of daily household
affairs. But the actuating principle of the psychic
investigators had changed. Those who thoroughly
believed in occultism, sought expectantly for further
proofs. Those who were still uncertain,
awaited developments. And those who had little
or no belief in the supernatural sought some clues
or hints that might point to a human criminal.
Dan Peterson was among these last. A good,
able-minded detective, though not of the transcendental
type found in story-books, he worked diligently
at his problem, which seemed to him a harder
one than he had ever before tackled.
His suspicions were all toward the servants of
the house, and with these he included Elijah Stebbins.
Nor was he illogical in his thoughts. Stebbins
was acting queerly. He was frightened at questions,
and was difficult to get hold of for an interview.
He answered at random, frequently contradicted
himself, and showed a positive terror of his
own house, since the tragedies there.
[175]
       If he killed those two people with his own
hands, he couldn       t act any different,        Peterson said
to Landon, whom he frequently consulted.        But
I can       t imagine any way to connect him up with it.
He was home in East Dryden when they died, and
that       s certain. Now, if he could have made old
Thorpe act as his tool       but, Lord, why would he do
it, anyhow! It       s too absurd to think Stebbins would
want to take those two lives! He wanted you people
should be scared, that I       m sure of. He did all
he could to scare you,       that I know. But as to
killing any of you, I       m sure he didn       t. Howsumever,
somebody committed those murders, and I       m
going to find out who!       
[176]
CHAPTER XII
The Professor       s Experience
But the days passed by, and Dan Peterson was
unable to make good his word. Everybody,
outside of the immediate household at Black
Aspens believed the two mysterious deaths were the
result of the murderous intent of one or more
human beings, and refused absolutely to consider
the spook nonsense offered in explanation by the
friends and relatives of the victims.
Meanwhile there were a few further inexplicable
happenings in the old house. Now and then, one or
another would notice the odour of prussic acid, or
would report a glimpse of a ghostly figure prowling
round at night, or tell of hearing low moans at four
o       clock in the morning.
But, usually, these were the experiences of only
one, and lacking corroboration, could be set down to
imagination, which was now especially vivid in all
the party. Often Eve or Norma recounted some of
these mysteries, but Landon laughed at them and
said the girls had been dreaming.
[177]
Professor Hardwick experienced no similar illusions,
though he longed to do so. Indeed, he
really watched and listened, hoping for some message
or manifestation from his friend, Gifford
Bruce. But none was vouchsafed to him, and
though interested in the experiences of the others,
he still longed for a personal experience.
And finally one came to him.
At four o       clock one morning, he lay awake, as
often, listening to the strokes of the hall clock,
which none of them could ever hear without a thrill,
and slowly in at his bedroom door floated a dim,
ghostly shape.
There was not sufficient light for him to discern
more than the outline of what seemed to be a tall,
gaunt figure, with a shawl over its head. Nearer
to him the thing came, and the old Professor felt
himself grow cold with fear. He had often boasted
of his desire to see the ghost, and of his scorn of
fear in connection therewith. But now, that the
spectre had really appeared to him, the old man
trembled all over, and tried in vain to cry out.
His throat contracted, his tongue was powerless,
and a sort of paralysis of terror held him in thrall.
The approaching figure seemed not to walk, but
progressed by a strange gliding motion, and came
within a foot or two of the bed, where the Professor
lay, shivering with dread.
Still but a misty wraith, the awful thing leaned
over the prostrate man and as the shawled head
drew near, Professor Hardwick saw dimly the face
of his visitor, and it was a skull!
[178]
The fearsome sight of hollow eye-sockets and
grinning, fleshless jaws, gave a sudden strength to
the frightened man, and he uttered a faint terrorized
scream.
Slowly the spectre raised a long, white-draped
arm, and Hardwick saw a small glass tumbler in
front of his face. Only for an instant, and then
the phantom faded away, and vanished into space.
Again the Professor called out, and hurrying
footsteps were heard in the hall.
Mr. Tracy was away in Boston, and Rudolph
Braye had gone to New York, so the only other
man in the house was Landon, who came hastily
to the Professor       s door in his dressing-gown and
slippers.
       What is it,        he asked,        did you call? Are you
ill?       
       The       the ghost                      the old man articulated
with difficulty.
       Nonsense!        said Landon,        you       ve been dreaming.
Where       s a ghost? I just came along the corridor,
and I didn       t see any.       
       Don       t tell me I didn       t see it,        babbled the Professor.
       I did, Wynne, as plain as I see you now.       
Landon had brought his own bedroom candle,
and by its scant light he scanned the old man       s face.
       You       re all scared up, Professor,        he said,
kindly.        Guess I       ll give you a nightcap, and send
you back to sleep again, it       s only four or so.       
[179]
       I know it, Wynne, it was just four when that       that
thing came. I wasn       t asleep, I haven       t been
for an hour or more. Just at four o       clock,       the
hall clock was striking,       I saw that awful thing
come stalking in       and       and it had a death       s head
under that white shawl                     
       Hold on, there, Professor, if that       s so, there
must be somebody who did the stalking! I       m going
to make search.       
Landon called Thorpe, and together the two went
over the whole house, searching in every nook and
cranny that could possibly conceal an intruder. But
none was found. Every door and window was securely
fastened, and as Landon had often observed,
not a mouse could get into Black Aspens, once it
was locked up for the night.
       Nothing doing, Professor,        he reported cheerfully,
after the search.        We lighted up the whole
place, and we scoured for burglars or ghost-pretenders,
but nothing human has entered this house
to-night. Nor was your spook any of ourselves,
for Milly has rounded up the girls, and I       ve made
sure that the doors that shut off the servants        quarters
have not been opened. Now, what have you
to say?       
       Only that I saw the thing,        the Professor had
pulled himself together,        and I       m not prepared to
say whether I think it was a phantom or a person
pretending to be one. You       re sure about the servants?       
       Absolutely, they couldn       t get through.       
       What about Stebbins? Could he have been
concealed in the house all night?       
[180]
       No; and if he had, how could he have got out?
All the doors and windows are locked on the inside,
just as they       ve been all night. He couldn       t lock
them behind him.       
       Thorpe could let him in and out, if he wanted
to.       
       Into the back part of the house. But Thorpe
himself can       t get into the main house, the rooms
that we use, after I lock the doors between. Come,
now, Professor, you know all that as well as I do.
Either you dreamed your ghost, or it       s the real
thing, this time. Take your choice.       
Landon was so cheerful and took the thing so
lightly, that Hardwick began to feel more at ease,
and recounted his story in further detail.        It was
the real thing,        he concluded.        I wish Rudolph
or Mr. Tracy had been here. They sleep in this
wing, and they would have come to me more quickly
than you did, Wynne.       
       I came the moment I heard you call, at least, as
soon as I could slip into a bathrobe.       
       I know you did, and it wouldn       t have mattered.
That thing didn       t walk away down the corridor, you
know, it just faded away,       vanished into the air. I
could see it                     
       How could you, with no light?       
       I don       t know how I did. It wasn       t exactly
luminous, and yet it gave out a very faint glow,
enough for me to see it, anyhow. Oh, I shall never
forget its awful grin!       
[181]
Professor Hardwick told his tale to Eve and
Norma later in the day, and in the afternoon the
men returned. Mr. Tracy said he had been to
Boston, to see the trustees of a church that had
called him to its pastorate, and Braye had been in
New York looking after some of his late uncle       s
business affairs.
Both men were deeply interested in the story of
the ghost, for as they said, Professor Hardwick
was not one to imagine or to think himself awake
when he was dreaming.
They listened attentively, and Tracy summed it up
by saying,        Well, if Professor Hardwick saw that,
it makes me feel like believing in the supernatural.       
       Me, too,        agreed Braye.        I don       t take much
stock in the stories of the girls, for Eve is a visionary
creature, and Norma is very imaginative. But
when a rational, scientific man sees things, I believe
the things are there to be seen! At least, I       m willing
to believe. I would feel more certain if I saw
it myself,       and yet,       to tell the truth I       ve no desire
to see it. I       ll take other people       s words for it.
How about you, Tracy?       
       I don       t believe I       m psychic, or sensitive, or whatever
you call it,        and the clergyman smiled.        You
know I slept in the Room with the Tassels, but no
ghostly visitor favoured me.       
[182]
       It may come to you yet,        said Hardwick, turning
grave eyes on Tracy,        or you, either, Rudolph.
You see, it doesn       t visit only that room. I wish
some of you others could see it, I       d feel more sure
of my own story.       
       Aren       t you sure of it?        asked Tracy.
       What do you mean by sure?        queried the Professor,
a little petulantly.        Of course, I       m sure I
saw what I       ve told you, but I want to be sure it was
a ghost, and not a person tricking me. Could it
have been Miss Carnforth, now?       
       No, it wasn       t,        declared Landon.        Milly went
to the girls as I went to you, Professor, and found
them both asleep. Or at least they were dozing, but
they were safely in their beds. You know we       re all
more or less wakeful at four A.M.       
       Four P.M. is a more fatal time,        said Braye,
musingly.        The whole thing is frightful. I       m
for going back to New York, as soon as we can.       
       If this should be the eleventh case,        began the
Professor.
       What do you mean, the eleventh case?        asked
Tracy.
       As I told these people before we started up
here, Andrew Lang has said, in one of his books,
that ten out of every eleven cases of so-called supernatural
manifestations are produced by fraud.
When I said that, Miss Carnforth very astutely
said, that it was the eleventh case that was of interest
to investigators. And I agreed. If this,
now, is the eleventh case,       I don       t mean only my
experience of last night, but all our experiences up
here,       if this is the eleventh case, that is not the
result of fraud, and it certainly looks like it, why,
then, we have something worth investigating.       
[183]
       Not at the cost of any more lives,        said Braye,
sternly.        If it is the eleventh case, and if it is
going right on being an eleventh case, I       ve had
enough of it! Perhaps that apparition of a glass
in the spectre       s hand, foretells tragedy to you,
Professor.       
Braye spoke gloomily, rather than as an alarmist,
but the Professor turned white.        I       ve thought of
that,        he said, in a low voice.        That       s why I want
to be sure the phantom was a real one. If it was
fraud, I have no fear, but if it was really the disembodied
spirit of that shawled woman, appearing
in her own materialized skeleton,       I, too, have had
about enough investigating!       
       What do you think, Norma?        Braye asked of
the girl, as, later in the afternoon, they were walking
round along the wild path that was the only
approach to the great portals of Black Aspens.
       I don       t know, Rudolph, but I       m beginning to
think there is a human hand and brain back of it
all. I       m a sensitive, and that       s one reason why
these things don       t appeal to me as supernatural.
I       ve had more or less experience with supernormal
matters and I       ve never known anything like the
things that have happened and are happening up
here.       
[184]
       Whom do you suspect, Norma? Tell me, for
I, too, think there may be some trickery, and I
wonder if we look in the same direction.       
       I don       t want even to hint it, Rudolph, but                     
       Don       t hesitate to tell me, dear. Oh, that
slipped out! I       ve no right to say        dear        to you, but,       Norma,
after we get back to town, after these
horrors are farther in the past, mayn       t I tell
you then,       what I hope you will be glad to
hear?       
       Don       t       don       t say such things,        and a pained
look came into the blue eyes.        You know you are
not free to talk like that!       
       Not free? Why am I not? What do you
mean?       
       You know, you must know. Eve told me                     
       Eve couldn       t have told you that there was anything
between her and me! Why, Norma, I have
loved you from the very first moment I laid eyes
on you! I have kept myself from telling you, because
of all these dreadful things that have been
going on. This atmosphere is no place for love-making,
but, dearest, just give me a gleam of
hope that later,       when we go back home, that I
may                     
       Oh, Rudolph! Look! What is that? See, in
the Room with the Tassels!       
They had neared the house on their return stroll,
and from the window of the fatal room peered out
at them a ghastly, grinning skull!
[185]
It was nearly dusk, but they could see quite clearly
the hollow eye-sockets and the awful teeth of the
fleshless face.
Norma clung to Braye, almost fainting. He
slipped an arm round her saying,        Brace up,
Norma, dearest, be brave. This is our chance. Let
us dash right in, and see if it is still there. Stay
here, if you prefer, but I must go!       
He hastened toward the house, and Norma kept
pace with him. She felt imbued with his spirit of
courage and bravery, and together they hurried
and burst in at the front door, which was never
locked save at night.
Without stopping, Braye rushed into the Room
with the Tassels. But there was no one there, and
no sign of any occupant, either human or supernatural.
There was no one in the hall, and further search
showed no one in the drawing room. Nor could
anything unusual be found in the house.
Most of the people were in their rooms. Eve
was partly ill with a headache, and Milly was looking
after her.
The men appeared as Braye and Norma called
out, and soon all had gathered to hear the strange
new story.
       I shouldn       t believe it, if you hadn       t both seen
it,        said the Professor,        but I can       t think you were
both under the spell of imagination.       
[186]
       I want to go home,        Milly said, plaintively,        I
don       t want to see the thing, and I       m afraid I       ll be
the next one it will visit.       
       We will go, dear,        said Landon.        As soon as
we can make arrangements we       ll get off. Don       t you
say so, Eve?       
       Yes,        she assented, but slowly.        I would
prefer to stay a bit longer, myself, but I really don       t
think Milly ought to. However, I       ll do as the
majority wish.       
But the matter of going away from Black Aspens
was not entirely at their own disposal. The detective,
Dan Peterson, had been exceedingly busy, and
had wrung a confession out of Elijah Stebbins. It
had been a mild sort of third degree, but it had
resulted in a frank avowal of Stebbins        implication
in some, at least, of the mysterious happenings that
had puzzled the people at Black Aspens.
Stebbins defended himself by the statement that
he only rented his house on the understanding
that it was haunted. He said, it was reputed
haunted, but he knew that unless something
mysterious occurred, the tenants would feel dissatisfied.
He said, too, that he saw no harm in doing a few
little tricks to mystify and interest the investigators,
but he swore that he had no hand in the spectral
appearances nor in the awful tragedy of the four
o       clock tea.
[187]
What he did confess to was the placing of the
old, battered candlestick in Miss Reid       s room the
first night the party arrived.
       I done it, sort of on impulse,        he said;        I heard
       em talking about ghosts, and just to amaze them, I
sneaked in in the night and took that candlestick
offen Mr. Bruce       s dresser and set it on the young
lady       s. I didn       t mean any harm, only to stir things
up.       
       Which you did,        remarked Peterson drily.
       Go on.       
The confession was being recorded in the presence
of police officials, and Stebbins was practically
under arrest, or would be very shortly after his tale
was told.
       Well, then, the first night Mr. Bruce slept in
that room, that ha       nted room, I thought I       d wrap
a sheet round me and give him a little scare,       he
was so scornful o        ghosts, you know. An        I did,
but nobody would believe his yarn. So that       s all I
did. If any more of them ghost performances was
cut up by live people, they wasn       t me. Somebody
else did it.       
And no amount of further coercion could budge
Stebbins from these statements. He stuck to it,
that though he had tricked his tenants, he had done
nothing to harm them, and his intentions were of
the best, as he merely wanted to give them what
they had taken his house for.
       You intended to keep it up?        asked Peterson.
[188]
       Yes, I did, but after they took things into their
own hands, and played spooks themselves, what was
the use?       
       How did you get into the house at night, when
it was so securely locked?        asked Peterson.
       I managed it, but I won       t tell you how,        said
Stebbins, doggedly.
       With Thorpe       s help,        suggested Peterson,        or       oh,
by Jinks!        he whistled;        I think I begin to
see a glimmer of a gleam of light on this mystery!
Yes, I sure do! Excuse me, and I       ll fly over to the
house and do a little questioning. Officer, keep
friend Stebbins safe against my return.       
Arrived at Black Aspens, Peterson asked for
Rudolph Braye, and was closeted with him for a
secret session, from which Braye came forth looking
greatly worried and perturbed.
Peterson went away, and Braye sought the
others. He found them listening to a letter which
Professor Hardwick had just received and which
the old man was reading aloud.
       It       s from Mr. Wise,        he said to Braye, as the
latter came in hearing.        He       s a detective, and he
writes to me, asking permission to take up this
case.       
       What a strange thing to do!        exclaimed Braye.
[189]
       Yes,        agreed Hardwick,        and he seems to be
a strange man. Listen;        If I succeed in finding
a true solution to the mystery, you may pay me
whatever you deem the matter worth, if I do not,
there will be no charge of any sort. Except that
I should wish to live in the house with you all, at
Black Aspens. I know all of the affair that has
been printed in the newspapers, and no more. If
you are still in the dark, I should like prodigiously
to get into the thick of it and will arrive as soon
as you summon me.       
There was more to the letter but that was the
gist of it, and Braye listened in silence.
       I think,        he said, as the Professor finished,
       that we don       t want that detective poking into our
affairs.       
       I agree,        said Landon.        There       s been quite
enough publicity about all this already, and I, for
one, prefer to go back to New York and forget it
as soon as we can.       
       We can       t forget it very soon, Wynne,        put in
Milly,        but I, too, want to go back to New
York.       
       We can       t go right off,        Braye told them,        we
must wait a week or so, at least.       
       Why?        asked Eve, not at all displeased by this
statement, for she frankly admitted a desire to
stay longer at Black Aspens.
       Oh, lots of reasons.        Braye put her off.        But
let       s settle down for another week here, and then
we       ll see.       
[190]
       Then I       m going to tell Wise to come up for that
week,        declared the Professor.        I don       t altogether
adhere to my conviction as to supernatural
powers, and I want to see what a big, really clever
detective can dig up in the way of clues or evidence
or whatever they work by.       
       Oh, cut out Wise,        urged Braye.        We don       t
want any more detectives than we are ourselves.
And Peterson is pretty busy just now, too.       
It was after the confab broke up that Milly went
to Braye.
       Why don       t you want Mr. Wise to come?        she
said, without preamble.
       Why, oh,       why just        cause I don       t,        he stammered,
in an embarrassed way.
       You can       t fool me, Rudolph,        she said, with an
agonized look on her pretty face.        You are afraid
he       ll suspect Wynne,       aren       t you?       
       Don       t, Milly,        urged Braye,        don       t say such
things!       
       You are! I know from the way you try to
put me off. Oh, Braye, he didn       t do it! He hadn       t
any hand in any of the queer doings, had he, Rudolph?
Tell me you know he hadn       t!       
       Of course, Milly, of course.       
       But, listen, Rudolph, I heard some of the things
that Peterson man said to you, I listened at the
door, I couldn       t help it.       
       Milly! I       m ashamed of you!       
       I don       t care! I       m not ashamed. But,       I heard
him say that he thinks Wynne is in league with Mr.
Stebbins and that the two of them brought about
all the mysterious doings                     
[191]
       Hush, Milly! Don       t let any one hear you!
You mustn       t breathe such things!       
       But he did say so, didn       t he, Rudolph?       
       I won       t tell you.       
       I know he did! I heard him.       
       Then forget it, as soon as you can. Trust me,
Milly. I       ll do all I can to keep suspicion from
Wynne. But, do this, Milly. Use all your powers
of persuasion with Professor Hardwick, and make
him give up his plan of getting that detective up
here. That Wise is a wise one indeed! He       ll find
out every thing we don       t want known, and more,
too! Will you, Milly, will you,       if only for
Wynne       s sake       try to keep that man away?       
       I       ll try, Rudolph, oh, of course I will! But
what can I do, if the Professor has made up his
mind? You know how determined he is.       
       Get the girls to help. Don       t breathe to them a
word that you overheard Peterson say, but manage
to make them do all they can to keep that detective
off. If you all band together, you can do it.
Wynne won       t want him; I don       t; I don       t think Mr.
Tracy will; and if you women are on our side,
Hardwick will be only one against the rest of us,
and we must win the day! Milly, that Wise must
not come up here,       if you value your peace of
mind!       
       Oh, Rudolph, you frighten me so. I will do
all I can, oh, I will!       
[192]
CHAPTER XIII
Pennington Wise
When Mary Pennington married a man
named Wise, it was not at all an unusual
impulse that prompted her to name her
first born son after her own family name, and so
Pennington Wise came into being.
Then, of course, it followed, as the night the day,
that his school chums should call him Penny Wise,
which name stuck to him through life. Whether
this significant name was the cause of his becoming
a detective is not definitely known, but a detective
he did grow up to be, and a good one, too. Eccentric,
of course, what worthwhile detective is not?
But clear cut of brain, mind and intelligence. And
always on the lookout for an interesting case, for
he would engage in no others.
Wherefore, his persistence in desiring to investigate
the strange mysteries of Black Aspens won the
day against Milly       s endeavours to prevent his coming.
She had done all she could, and most of the
house party had aided her efforts, but Professor
Hardwick had become imbued with the idea that
there was human agency at work, and that his belief
in spiritual visitation, honest though it had been,
was doomed to a speedy death, unless further proof
could be shown.
[193]
Norma, too, was rather inclined to welcome a
specialist in the solving of mysterious problems, and
in conference with the Professor agreed to do all
she could to help the Wise man in his work.
Norma was still of the opinion that the two tragic
deaths were the work of evil spirits, but if it were
not so, she wanted to know it.
But the principal reason why Pennington Wise
came to Black Aspens was his own determination to
do so. He had never heard of such an unusual and
weird mystery, and it whetted his curiosity by its
strange and almost unbelievable details.
The opposing party gave in gracefully, when they
found his advent was inevitable. All but Milly, that
is. She spent her time alternately crying her heart
out in Wynne       s arms, and bracing herself up for a
calm and indifferent attitude before the new investigator.
       Keep a stiff upper lip,        Braye advised her.
       Remember not to give out any information, Milly.
Let him find out all he can, but don       t help
him.       
       All right, Rudolph; and, anyway, I know
Wynne is innocent,                     
[194]
       Of course he is! That goes without saying.
But if he is suspected, say, if Stebbins or Thorpe
or anybody else puts Wise up to suspicion, it may
mean a bad quarter of an hour for all of us. So,
just be quiet, dignified, pleasant-mannered and all
that, but don       t say anything definite. For it might
be misconstrued and misunderstood, and make
trouble. At least, that       s the course I       m going to
pursue, and I think it       s the best plan.       
       Oh, I know it is,        Milly agreed.        In fact,
that       s just about what Wynne told me; he thinks
if I try to help, I       ll only make mistakes, so he, too,
told me to keep quiet. Eve is awfully angry, because
that man is coming. She       s not saying so, but
I know her! And, Rudolph, she       s afraid of something.
I don       t know what, exactly, but she       s fearfully
afraid of developments.       
       We all are, Milly. If the detective pins it on
any human being,       that means trouble, and if he
decides it       s spooks, after all,       I think I       ll be more
afraid of them than ever!       
       I can       t be any more afraid of them than I
am!        Milly shuddered.        Oh, Rudolph, how I
wish we had never come up here!       
       We all wish that, Milly, but as we       re in for it
now, we must see it through.       
Pennington Wise arrived the next afternoon. He
came into the hall like an army with banners. A
tall, well set-up man, of about thirty-three or four,
thick chestnut hair, worn          la brosse, clear blue
eyes, a clean-cut, fine-featured face, and a manner
that proclaimed generalship and efficiency to the last
degree.
[195]
       Here I am,        he announced, setting down several
pieces of hand luggage and whipping off his soft
gray felt hat.        You are the hostess?       
His quick-darting eyes had picked out Milly, and
he greeted her as a distinguished visitor might.
       Who is that?        exclaimed Milly, looking at a
slight, black-haired girl who followed quietly in
Wise       s footsteps.
       That? oh that       s Zizi,       part of my luggage. Put
her any place. Is there a housekeeper person?
Yes? Well, turn Zizi over to her, she       ll be all
right.       
Hester was peeping in at a rear door, unable to
restrain her curiosity as to the commotion, and Zizi
glided toward her and disappeared in the shadows.
       Now,        said Wise, his quick smile flashing inclusively
at all of them,        we must get acquainted.
I       m Penny Wise, and all possible jokes on my name
have already been made, so that       s all right. I know
Mrs. Landon, and you, of course,        looking at
Wynne,        are her husband. Professor Hardwick,       
and he bowed slightly,        is the man with whom I
have had a short correspondence regarding my coming
here. You, sir,                      he looked inquiringly at
Braye.
[196]
       I       m Rudolph Braye, nephew of Mr. Gifford
Bruce, and present heir to his fortune.        The quiet
sadness of Braye       s tone precluded any idea of his
triumph of exultation at the fact he stated.        This,       
he went on,        is the Reverend Mr. Tracy, a friend
of us all. And these ladies are Miss Carnforth and
Miss Cameron, both deeply interested in the solution
of the mysteries that confront us. Since introductions
are in order, may I inquire further concerning
the young lady,       or child,       who accompanied
you?       
       Zizi? She       s part of my working outfit. In
fact, one of my principal bits of paraphernalia. I
always use her on mysterious cases. Don       t look on
her as an individual, please, she       s a property,       in
the theatrical sense, I mean.       
       But her standing in the household?        asked
Milly,        does she belong with the servants, or in
here with us?       
       She       ll look after that herself,        and Penny Wise
smiled.        Pay no more attention to her than you
would to my umbrella or walking stick. Now
we know each others        names, let       s proceed to the
case itself. Who is going to tell me all about
it?       
       Which of us would you rather have do so?       
asked Eve, her long, glittering eyes fixed on the
detective       s face.
He glanced at her quickly, and then let his gaze
continue to rest on her beautiful, sibylline countenance.
       Not you,        he said,        you are too       well, I suppose
the word I must use is temperamental, but it       s
a word I hate.       
       Why?        asked the Professor,        what do you
mean by temperamental?       
[197]
       That       s the trouble,        smiled Wise.        It doesn       t
mean anything. Strictly speaking, every one has
temperament of one sort or another, but it has come
to mean an emotional temperament,                     
       What do you mean by emotional?        interrupted
Hardwick.
       There you go again!        and Wise looked amused.
       Emotions are of all sorts, but emotional has come
to be used only in reference to demonstrations of
the affections.       
       You       re a scholar!        cried the Professor.
       Rarely do I meet a man with such a fine sense
of terminology!       
       Glad you       re pleased. But, Professor, neither
do I choose you as historian of the affairs of Black
Aspens. Let me see,        his eyes roved from one to
another,        it seems to me I       ll get the most straightforward,
uncoloured statement from a clerical mind.
I think Mr. Tracy can tell me, in the way I want
to hear it, a concise story of the mysteries and
tragedies you have been through up here.       
Mr. Tracy looked at the detective gravely.
       I am quite willing to do what I can,        he said,
       and I will tell the happenings as I know them.
For occasions when I was not present, or where my
memory fails, the others will, I trust, be allowed to
help me out.       
[198]
And then, the whole matter was laid before the
intelligence of Pennington Wise, and with a rapt
look of interest and a few pointed questions here
and there, the detective listened to the history of
his new case.
At last, the account having been brought up to
date, Wise nodded his head, and sat silent for a
moment. It was not the melodramatic silence of
one affecting superiority, but the more impressive
quietude of a mind really in deep thought.
Then Wise said, simply,        I       ve heard nothing yet
to make me assume any supernatural agency.        Ve
you, Zizi?       
       No,        came a soft, thin voice from the shadowy
depths of the rear hall.
Milly jumped.        Has she been there all the
time?        she said.
       She       s always there,        returned Wise, in a matter-of-fact
way.        Now I       m ready to declare that
the deaths of your two friends are positively not due
to spiritistic wills, but are dastardly murders, cleverly
accomplished by human hands and human
brains.       
       How?        gasped Eve Carnforth. She was leaning
forward, her beryl eyes dilated and staring, her
hands clenched, her slender form trembling with
excitement.
       That I do not know yet,       do you, Zizi?       
       No,        came tranquilly from the distance.
       Let that girl come here,        cried Milly, pettishly.
       It gets on my nerves to have her speaking from
way back there!       
[199]
       Come here, Zizi,        directed Penny Wise, and the
slim young figure glided toward them. She was a
mere slip of a girl, a wisp of humanity, in a flimsy
frock of thin black stuff, with a touch of coral-tinted
chiffon in bodice and sash. The skirt was
short, and her black silk stockings and high-heeled
pumps gave her a chic air. Her black hair was
drawn smoothly back, in the prevailing mode, and
though she had an air of world-knowledge, she was
inconspicuous in effect.
Without a glance at the people, personally, she sat
down in a chair, a little apart, yet in full view of all.
Wise paid no attention to her, and went on,
thoughtfully.        No, there is no evidence pointing to
the occult, but innumerable straws to show which
way the camel       s back is to be broken.       
       Mr. Wise,        said Eve, determinedly,        I don       t
think it is fair for you to hear the story only from
Mr. Tracy. I think he is opposed to a belief in
psychics and so unintentionally colours his narrative
to lead away from such theories.       
       That may be so,        said Tracy, himself, looking
thoughtfully at Eve;        and I agree it would be
fairer to hear the story, or parts of it, retold by
Miss Carnforth or some one who fully believes in
spiritism.       
       Right,        said Wise;        go ahead, Miss Carnforth,
tell me anything that seems to you different in
meaning from what Mr. Tracy has described.       
[200]
Quite willing, Eve told of the ghostly visitant that
had appeared to her the night she slept in the
Room with the Tassels, and then described vividly
the ghost that had appeared to Vernie, as Vernie
had told it to her.
       You see,        she concluded,        there is no explanation
for these things, other than supernatural, for
the locks and bars on the house preclude intrusion
of outsiders, and all the occupants of the house are
accounted for. I tell you the things just as they
happened.       
       With no wish to be discourteous, Miss Carnforth,
I would advise you to tell those tales to the
submarines. Even the marines couldn       t swallow
those! Could they, Zizi?       
       No,        and now that they could see the girl, all
noticed a slight smile of amusement on her young
face. It was quickly followed by a look of horror
in her black eyes, as she murmured,        What awful
frights you must have had!        and she glanced at
Milly, in sympathy. Then she turned toward
Norma, and seemed about to speak, but thought
better of it.
Not looking toward his        property,        Wise went
on talking.        I can readily see how any one willing
to believe in the occult could turn these weird happenings
into plausible proof. But it is not so. Miss
Carnforth       s own story convinces me even more
strongly that there has been diabolical cleverness
used, but by a human being, not a phantom.       
       And you will discover how, you will solve the
mysteries?        asked the Professor, eagerly.
[201]
       I hope to. But it is the most difficult appearing
case I have ever encountered.       
       It is not an eleventh case, then?        and Professor
Hardwick told again of Andrew Lang       s percentage
of proof.
       No, it is not. It is one of the ten that are the
result of fraud. Now to find the perpetrator of the
fraud.       
       At least you must admit, Mr. Wise,        said Eve,
a little spitefully,        that your saying it is a case of
fraud does not make it so.       
       No,        agreed Wise, smiling in an exasperatingly
patronizing way,        it sure does not. In fact it has
already made itself so.       
       And your discovery of the means used is bound
to come?        asked Tracy, with interest.
       Bound to come,        repeated the detective.        But
don       t let us begin by being at odds with each other.
I came here to discover the truth. If any one wants
the truth to remain undiscovered, now is the time
to say so. For it will soon be too late.       
       Why should any one want the truth to remain
undiscovered?        said Braye, abruptly.
       For two reasons,        replied Wise, seriously.
       First, any one criminally implicated might wish
it to remain unknown; second, any one wishing to
shield another, might also wish no discoveries
made.       
       But you don       t think any of us are criminally
implicated, I hope,        and Braye looked questioning.
[202]
       There are others in this house beside you people,       
Wise returned;        and I tell you frankly, I       m
not ready yet to suspect any one or even imagine
who the criminal may be. I only state positively
that disembodied spirits are not responsible for
those two tragic deaths. Also, may I ask you to
remember, that I       ve only just arrived, that I       ve had
a tiresome journey, that I       d like rest and refreshment,
and that there are more days coming for my
further work.       
       Why, bless my soul!        exclaimed the Professor,
       that       s all true! Do you know, Mr. Wise, it seems
as if you       d always been here, it seems as if you were
already one of us.       
       Thank you, sir, that       s a pleasant compliment to
my personality, anyway. And now, if you please,
Mrs. Landon, may I be shown to my room?       
       Certainly,        said Milly, and she rang for
Thorpe, as Landon rose to escort the guest himself.
       Where       s that girl?        said Norma, looking round
after the detective had gone off,        what became of
her?       
But there was no sight of the little black-robed
figure.
       Oh, let her alone,        said Eve,        she slid out to
the kitchen, I think. Hester will look after her.
That man said to pay no more attention to her than
to his hand luggage. She       ll look out for herself,
I       ve no doubt. Isn       t she awful, anyway?       
[203]
       I think she       s pretty,        said Norma,        in a weird,
elfin sort of way.       
       She knows it all,        said Braye.        I never saw
such an effect of old head on young shoulders in my
life. But what a funny way to treat her.       
       She       s a spy,        declared Eve,        that       s what she is,
a spy! With her silent, gliding ways, and her sly,
soft voice! I hate her!       
       Now, now, Evie, don       t be unjust!        and Braye
smiled at her.        She is a bit your style and temperament,
but don       t be jealous!       
       Nonsense!        and Eve laughed back at him,
       why, she isn       t a bit like me! She has black hair
and eyes                     
       I didn       t notice,        said Braye,        but she impressed
me as being like you in lines and motions.       
       A pocket edition,        laughed Tracy.        Miss
Carnforth would make two of that little shrimp,
and Miss Carnforth is a sylph, herself.       
The party broke up into smaller groups, and
Braye and Norma sauntered off for their usual
afternoon stroll.
Eve watched them go, her eyes moodily staring.
       Won       t I do?        said Tracy       s quiet voice, and Eve
pulled herself together and smiled at him.
       You       re the one I want most,        she declared gaily,
unwilling to be thought disappointed.        Let       s walk
down by the lake.       
[204]
The walk by the lake was always shaded, but as
the day was murky it was gloomier than ever.
       You like this place?        asked Tracy, with a
glance at the black grove of aspens, and their dark
reflection in the still water of the deep pool.
       Yes, I do; or, I did, until that man came up
here. There       s no use in pursuing our investigations
with him around.       
       All the more use,        declared Tracy.        If any
supernatural things happen it will refute his cocksure
decisions.       
       Yes, it would. Oh, I do wish a ghost would
appear to him, and scare him out of his wits!       
       He has plenty of wits, Miss Carnforth, and he       d
take some scaring, I think. But if a real phantasm
came, he       d know it, and he       d acknowledge it, I       m
sure. He strikes me as an honourable man, and a
decent, straightforward sort.       
       If he is,        and Eve ruminated,        perhaps he can
help us to investigate                     
       That       s what he       s here for.       
       I mean investigate our beliefs. If he could be
convinced, as we are, of the existence of phantoms,
and of their visitations, he       d be a splendid help,
wouldn       t he? Perhaps I am in wrong in disliking
him.       
       You       re certainly premature. Why, not one man
out of a thousand does believe in the occult. And
not one in a million detectives, I daresay.       
Meantime, Braye and Norma were talking in like
vein.
[205]
       I do believe it was a spirit that killed our dear
Vernie, and Mr. Bruce,        Norma declared,        but if
Mr. Wise can prove the contrary, we want him
to do so, don       t we, Rudolph?       
       Of course, Norma, we all feel that way. I,
especially, for as heir to Uncle Gif       s money, I       m in
a peculiar position. But if anybody can get at the
truth, this Wise person can. He       s a live wire, I
can see that.       
       Shall we help him, Rudolph, or hold back and
let him work alone?       
       Help him, of course! Why not? But, be
careful that it is help we offer him, and not merely
stupid interference.       
       What do you mean by that?       
       Nothing particular; but some of us are inclined
to be a bit officious, and       oh, I don       t know, Norma,       I
don       t want to say anything       even to you. Let       s
talk of pleasanter subjects.       
       What, for instance?       
       You, for instance! You       re enchanting to-day,
in that pale blue gown. It makes you look like an
angel.       
       Do they wear pale blue?       
       I don       t know what they wear, and shan       t care
until you really are one, and then, I hope I       ll be one,
too. But you look like an angel, because of your
angelic face. It       s like a roseleaf washed in sunlight                     
[206]
       Now, Rudolph, don       t try to be poetical! You
can       t hit it off! A washed face is remindful of a
soap advertisement,       not an angel!       
       Rogue! You love to make fun of me! But I
don       t mind. Oh, Norma, I don       t care what you say
to me, if you       ll only say yes. Won       t you, dearest?       
       Bad boy! Behave yourself! I told you not to
ask any question until we get away from this place.
I won       t listen to love talk at Black Aspens! It       s
out of the picture!       
       But will you, as soon as we get back to New
York? Will you, Norma       darling?       
       Wait till then, and we       ll see,        was all the answer
he could get.
[207]
CHAPTER XIV
Zizi
       Where is she?        Milly asked of Hester,
as, more out of curiosity than hospitality
she went to the kitchen.
       Well! Mis        Landon, I never see such a thing
in all my born days! She slid out here like she was
on roller-skates!        Hester?        she says, smilin       , and
with that she settled herself for good and all,        sif
she       d been born an        brought up here! She slid to
the cupboard, and picked out the tea caddy, and took
down a little teapot, and in a jiffy, she       d snatched
up the b       ilin        teakettle, and was settin        at that there
table, drinkin        her tea! I got her out some cakes,
and by then she was a-cuttin        bread an        butter!
Never       ve I seen her like!       
       Did she trouble you?       
       Land, no, ma       am! She waits on herself, but
so quick, you       d think she was a witch!       
       Where is she now?       
[208]
       Well, ma       am, she finished her tea, and then she
fair scooted up the back stairs. I heard her dart
into one or two rooms, and then she took the little
South gable room for hers. I could hear her stepping
about, putting her things away, I make no
doubt. She looked in here again, a minute, and
said,        I       ve chosen that little room with the lattice
wall paper,        and then she disappeared again. That       s
all I know about her. No, ma       am, she don       t trouble
me none, and I don       t say I don       t sort o        take to
her. But she       s a queer little piece. She is that.       
Milly sighed.        Every thing       s queer, Hester,       
she said, broodingly, and then she went back to the
hall.
Wynne Landon sat there alone. His face was
grave, and he sighed deeply as his wife came to
him and laid her hand on his shoulder.
       Where       s everybody, Wynnsie?        she said
cheerily.
       Traipsing over the house, hunting clues! Rotten
business, Milly.       
       Why? What do you mean by that?       
       Nothing. I hope if that man is going to find
the criminal, he       ll make short work of it!       
       So do I, dear, then we can go home, can       t we?       
       You bet! Here they are, now,       they seem in
good spirits.       
The crowd came down the stairs and into the
great hall, laughing at some quip of Wise       s. Ever
since the day of the two deaths a sombre gloom had
pervaded the whole place, and smiles had been few.
The sound of laughter came as a shock to the Landons,
but the cheery face of Penny Wise betokened
only wholesome good nature, and not flippant heartlessness.
[209]
       Old Montgomery knew how to build a house,       
he commented, looking at the finely curving staircase,
and its elaborate balusters.        Living rooms
nowadays are all very well, but these great entrance
halls are finer places to congregate. You spend
much of your time here, I       m sure. The worst part
is, they       re difficult to light properly,       by daylight,
I mean. And, you       ve no electrics here, have you?       
       No,        replied Landon,        only kerosene and
candles. You see, the place has been unoccupied
for years.       
       Haunted houses are apt to be,                     
       Reputed haunted houses,        corrected the Professor.
       There are no others,        and Wise grinned.        All
reputed haunted houses have nothing to haunt them
but their repute. I mean, the story of their ghost
is all the ghost they have.       
       But I saw the ghost here,        and Eve spoke with
a quiet dignity that defied contradiction.
       Of course you did,        Wise assented.        The
ghost came purposely to be seen.       
       Did you ever see one, Mr. Wise?       
       I never did, Miss Carnforth, I never hope to
see one! But I can tell you anyhow, I       d rather see
than be one.       
       Oh, of course, if you       re going to take that
tone,        and Eve turned away, decidedly offended.
[210]
       Sorry!        and Wise flashed a smile at her.
       But, you see, a detective can       t afford to believe in
ghosts. We make our living solving mysteries, and
to say,        It was the ghost! You       re right, it was
the ghost!        is by way of begging the question.       
       Then you think the phantoms that appeared to
some of us were really human beings?        asked
Tracy, interestedly.
       I sure do.       
       And you propose to find out who and how?       
said Braye.
       If I live up to my reputation, I must do so.
There are but two kinds of detectives. Effective
detectives and defective detectives. It is the aim of
my life to belong to the former class, and here       s
my chance to make good. Now, I       ve examined the
upper floors, I       ll look over this hall and the ground
floor rooms. Shall I have time before dinner, Mrs.
Landon?       
His charm and pleasant personality had already
won Milly       s liking and she said, cordially,        Yes, indeed,
Mr. Wise. And if you wish, we       ll delay
dinner to suit your pleasure.       
       Not at all. Done in a few minutes. Stunning
hall, eh, Zizi?       
       Yes,        said the thin little voice of the thin little
girl, and Milly suddenly realized that Zizi was present
with the crowd.
The graceful little figure stepped forward and
stood at Wise       s side as he looked the hall over.
He tapped at the panelled walls, and smiled as he
said,        Solid and intact. No secret passage or sliding
panel,       of that I       m sure.       
[211]
       If you       re trying to find a secret entrance into
the house, Mr. Wise,        Landon said,        you are wasting
your time. I am more or less architecturally
inclined, and I       ve tapped and sounded and measured
and calculated,       and I can assure you there       s nothing
of the sort.       
       Good work! That saves me some trouble, I       m
sure. Marvellous work on these doors, eh? And
the bronze columns,       from abroad, I take it.       
       Yes;        Professor Hardwick said, slapping his
hand against one of the fluted bronze pillars,        I admire
these columns more than the doors even.
They       re unique, I don       t wonder their owner        built
a house behind them.        I doubt if their match is in
America.       
       And the locks and bolts are as ponderous as the
doors,        commented the detective.        Eh, Zizi?       
       They are like that all over the house,        said the
girl, in a casual tone.        Even the kitchen quarters
are as securely fastened and bolted. And upstairs,
any doors that give on balconies are strongly
guarded. I have never seen a house more carefully
looked after in the matter of barricades.       
The girl spoke slowly, as if on the witness stand.
Then suddenly her black eyes twinkled, and she
turned sharply toward Eve, saying,        Oh, do you
do that, too?       
       Do what?        cried Eve, angrily.        What do
you mean?       
[212]
       Scribble notes, and pass        em to somebody. I
do, too. It       s a habit I can       t seem to break myself
of.       
       I didn       t!        and Eve       s face flushed and her eyes
glittered with a smouldering fire.
       Oh, tra la la,        trilled Zizi, and nonchalantly
turned away.
       Now for the Room with the Tassels,        said
Wise, and led the way to the fateful room.
       Ghastly, ghostly and grisly!        he declared after
a quick survey,        but no entrance except by door
or windows.       
       And they were locked every time the room was
slept in by any of our party,        announced the Professor,
positively.
       That makes it easier,        smiled Wise.        You see,
I feared secret panels and that sort of thing,       not
uncommon in old houses. But you       ve found
none?       
       None,        asseverated Landon.        If your theory
of a human        ghost        is right, you       ve got to account
for the forcing of the big bolts of those front doors
or                     
       Or suspect some of your household,        concluded
Wise, practically.        Well, I haven       t suspected any
one as yet; I       m just absorbing facts, on which to
base my theories. Now, for the drawing room.       
The long sombre, old-fashioned room received
scant examination.
       Nothing doing, Zizi?        said Wise, briefly.
[213]
       Only a Bad Taste Exhibition,        the girl remarked,
making a wry face at the ornate decorations
and appointments. Then, with her peculiar,
gliding motion, she slid across the hall again, and
examined the knob and lock on the door of the
Room with the Tassels.
       Fascinating room,        she said, with a glance
round it.        But horrible,        and her thin shoulders
shrugged.        Those tassels are enough to make a hen
cross the road!       
Milly giggled, and for the first time since the day
of the tragedies.
Dinner was rather pleasant than otherwise. The
detective, laying aside all thought or talk of his
purpose there, was entertaining and even merry.
He spoke somewhat of himself, and it transpired
that he was an artist,       an illustrator of current
magazine stories.
       And Zizi is my model,        he informed them,
       that is, when I want a thin, scarecrow type. I
don       t use her for the average peach heroine. Look
out Ziz, don       t eat too much of that potato puff!
You see, if she puts on a bit of flesh, she runs
straight back to the movie studios.       
       Ah, a film star?        said Braye.
       Not a star,        and Wise shook his head.        But
a good little actress for a brat part.       
Zizi flashed an amused smile from her black eyes
and partook again of the forbidden potato puff.
       Zizi! For the love of Mike!        expostulated
Wise.
[214]
       The love of Mike is the root of all evil,        said
Zizi, saucily;        but then, everything is.       
       Is what?        asked Eve, interested against her
will in this strange child.
       Is the root of all evil,        was the calm reply.
       Whew! this must be an evil old world!        exclaimed
Braye.
       And isn       t it?        Zizi flashed back, her big eyes
sparkling like liquid jet.
       Are you a pessimist, little one?        asked the Professor,
studying the clever, eerie face.
       Nay, nay, Pauline,        and the small, pointed
chin was raised a bit.        Not so, but far otherwise.       
       Then why do you think the world is evil?       
       Ah, sir, when one spends one       s life between a
Moving Picture Studio and a popular artist       s studio,
one learns much that one had better left unlearnt.       
The child face suddenly looked ages old, and then,
as suddenly broke into a gay smile:        Don       t ask me
these things,        she said,        ask Penny Wise. I       m only
his Pound Foolish.       
       You       ll put on another foolish pound if you eat
any more of that dessert,        growled Wise, scowling
at her.
       All right, I won       t,        and the slender little fingers
laid down the teaspoon Zizi was using. Then, in
an audible aside, she added,        Hester will give me
more, later,        and chuckled like a naughty child.
[215]
The next morning Pennington Wise set about his
work in earnest.        I       m going to East Dryden,       
he announced.        I want to interview the doctors,
also Mr. Stebbins. I don       t mind saying frankly,
this is the deepest mystery I have ever encountered.
If any of you here can help me, I beg you will do
so, for the case looks well-nigh hopeless. Ah, there,
Zizi.       
The girl appeared, ready to go with Wise in the
motor car. She wore a small black hat with an
oriole       s wing in it, and a full-draped black cape,
whose flutterings disclosed an orange-coloured lining.
Inconspicuous, save when the cape       s lining
showed, Zizi looked distinguished and smartly costumed.
A small black veil, delicately adjusted,
clouded her sharp little features, and she sprang
into the car without help, and nestled into a corner
of the tonneau.
Only a chauffeur accompanied them, and he could
not hear the conversation carried on in low tones.
       What about it, Ziz?        murmured Wise, as they
passed the aspen grove and the black lake.
       Awful doings,        she returned, merely breathing
the words.        The Eve girl has a secret, too.       
       Too?       
       Yes, she isn       t the criminal, you know.       
       I don       t know.       
       Well, you will know. She       s a queer mechanism,
but she never killed anybody.       
       Sure, Zizi?       
[216]
       Sure, oh, Wise Guy. Now, who did do it?       
       Well, who did?       
       We don       t know yet, and we mustn       t theorize
without data, you know.       
       Rats! I always theorize without data. And
I       ve never failed to corral the data.       
       You       re a deuce of a deducer, you are!       
       And you       re a She Sherlock, I suppose! Well,
oh, Mine of Wisdom, go ahead. Spill it to me.       
       Can       t now. I       ve lost my place! But, after a
few more interviews with some few more interested
parties, I may, perhaps, possibly, maybe,       oh,
Penny, look back at the house from here! Did
you ever see such a weird, wild spook-pit!       
Black Aspens did indeed look repellent. No one
was in sight, and the grove of black, waving trees,
mirrored in the deep black shadows of the lake gave
it all a doomed effect that the dull, leaden sky
intensified.
The grim old house seemed the right abode for
evil spirits or uneasy wraiths, and Zizi, fascinated
by the still scene continued to gaze backward until
a turn of the road hid it from view.
Then she became silent, and would vouchsafe no
answer to Wise       s questions or make any remarks of
her own.
During the interview between the detective and
Elijah Stebbins, she said almost nothing, her big
eyes staring at the owner of Black Aspens, until the
old man writhed in discomfort.
[217]
       How did you get in?        she shot at him, as he
frankly admitted his harmless tricks to give his
tenants their desired interest in his house.
       I was in, miss,        Stebbins said, nervously twisting
his fingers;        I staid there the first night, and
       twas then I moved the old candlestick.       
       I don       t mean that,        and Zizi       s eyes seemed to
bore through to his very brain,        I mean the night
you played ghost.       
       Why,       I       that is,       they left a window
open                     
       They did not!        Zizi shot at him,        and you
know it! How did you get in?       
But old Stebbins persisted in his story of entrance
by an overlooked window.
       There       s heaps of windows in that house,        he
declared.        Land, I could get in any time I wanted
to.       
       Sure you could,        retorted Zizi,        but not through
a window!       
       How, then?        said Stebbins.
       That       s what I asked you. I know.       
       You know! How do you know?       
       Your mama told my mama and my mama told
me!        Zizi       s mocking laughter so incensed the old
man that he shook with fury.
       You don       t know!        he cried,               cause there       s
nothin        to know! Land! All them folks up there
has hunted the place for secret entrances, and I
ruther think you have too,        and he nodded at Wise.
[218]
       I have,        said Wise, frankly,        and I       ve discovered
none as yet. But, listen here, friend Stebbins,
if there is one, I will find it,       and that       s all
there is about that!       
Zizi said nothing, having returned to her taciturn
r       le, but the glance she threw at Stebbins, he
said afterward, made his blood run cold.
       She       s a witch-cat!        he declared to his cronies,
when telling the tale,        she ain       t all human,       or I       m
a sinner!       
On their way to see Dan Peterson, Wise inquired
concerning Zizi       s knowledge of a secret way to get
into the house.
       A small bluff,        she said, carelessly.        I dunno
how he got in, I       m sure. But I don       t believe those
people left a window conveniently open, unless       they
did it on purpose. Who does the locking up,
do you know?       
       Mr. Landon, I believe.       
       Quite so! It       s a pity, isn       t it Pen, how everything
appears to wind around back to that nice Mr.
Landon!       
       Well, what now?       
       Well, if he and Stebbins were in cahoots                     
       Hold up, Zizi, don       t run away with yourself!
You       re a day ahead of the fair. Now, are you going
to talk, in here at Peterson       s, or sit like a bump
on a log,       smiling at grief?       
       I dunno; which would you?       
       Talk,        said Wise, succinctly, and Zizi talked.
[219]
Indeed, she carried on the main part of the conversation,
which was exactly what Wise had meant
for her to do.
She charmed Peterson with her bright, alert air
and her pleasant, quick-witted way of putting things.
Together they went over the known details, and
then she cleverly drew from Peterson his deductions
and decisions.
At first, inclined to resent the advent of this all-wise
detective, he now began to think that if they
could work together, he would shine by reflected
glory, that is, if the new chap succeeded in solving
the mystery, which to him was inexplicable.
       I can       t suspect the Thorpes or Mr. Stebbins,       
Peterson finally declared:        I did think I could, but
though Eli did cut up some tricks, they were harmless
and merely in fun. And, too, he has absolute
alibis for all the spook appearances after a certain
date. And that       s the date when that Miss Carnforth
saw a ghost. As near as I can make out, that
ghost was Stebbins himself, but no spooks after
that was Stebbins        doings. Now, I give you that
straight and simple, Mr. Wise, but it took me a long
time to ferret it out. I suspected it, but I       ve had
hard work to get Stebbins to admit his tricks, and
also to check up his alibis after that particular
night.       
       These perfectly attested alibis are sometimes
manufactured very carefully,        said Zizi, fixing her
black eyes on Peterson.
[220]
       Yes, they are. That       s why I checked up Eli       s
so carefully. But they       re all true. I       ve got an
exact list of the spook performances from the people
at the house. I got the data from different ones,
at different times, so       s to be sure they were all there.
Then, I looked up Stebbins        whereabouts on each
occasion, and as I tell you, after the night he owns
up to playing ghost, he never did it again.       
       Then did he arrange for the Thorpes or one
of the waiting-maids to do it?        queried Zizi.
       That I can       t say. I think he must have done
so, but I can       t find a scrap of proof, nor is there any
motive. Stebbins is a good old sort and he honestly
wanted to give his tenants the ha       nts, as he calls
       em, that they wanted. But why, on this good green
earth, he should want to kill two of them is unanswerable.
No, take it from me, Eli Stebbins is
no murderer. I       ve looked up his record and his life
story, and there       s no indication that he knew any of
these people before they came up here, so he couldn       t
have had any old grudge or family feud or anything
of that sort. Stebbins isn       t the criminal, no
sir-ee!       
       I never thought he was,        said Wise, quietly.
       You       ve done good work Mr. Peterson, and you       ve
saved me a heap of trouble in getting these facts
so undeniably established. I thank you, and I
shall be glad of your co      peration in my further
work.       
[221]
       Good for you, I       ll be right down glad to work
with you. And this young lady, Mr. Wise, is she
one of us?       
       She is us,        returned Wise, simply.        Don       t
bother about her, Mr. Peterson, she       s the sort that
looks after herself. Report to me, please, if you
discover anything new.       
[222]
CHAPTER XV
Tracy       s Story
       Now I wouldn       t say,        Wise observed,
       that there is no such thing as occult
phenomena                     
       What do you mean by phenomena?        interrupted
the Professor.        Not one person in ten uses
that word correctly.       
       I       m that single and unique one, old top,        Wise
assured him,        for my exact meaning, see Webster;
but I was going to say, even granting the possibility
of the two deaths being due to supernatural causes,
I       m not going to accept that solution of the mystery
until I       ve exhausted all other available means of
finding a flesh and blood murderer, which same I
strongly expect to find.       
       He       ll do it,        said Zizi, addressing the others,
while her black eyes looked at Wise as at an inanimate
object.        He       s an effective detective, first,
last and all the time. And I       m the little cog that
makes the wheels go round. So, I think, Tecky-teck,
that I       ll carry out a plan I       ve just thought of.
I       ll move from the pretty little bedroom I now occupy,
and sleep in the Room with the Tassels.       
       Oh, don       t!        cried Norma.        Something might
happen to you!       
[223]
       That       s what I       m flattering myself. And it       s
nice of you, Miss Cameron, to speak out like that.       
Zizi       s eyes flashed a quizzical glance at Eve, who
was nodding satisfaction at the proposed plan.
Eve coloured and dropped her eyes, and Zizi went
on.        You see, people, Mr. Wise can       t size up these
ghosts of yours unless he sees them,       and for me to
see them is the same thing. So I       m going to take
the haunted room for my own and if the Shawled
Woman appears, I       ll pin a tag on her shawl.       
Norma shuddered.        Don       t talk like that,        she
begged.        You don       t know what risk you run.
Milly, don       t let the child sleep there.       
But all objections were overruled, and Zizi quietly
transferred her few simple belongings to the Room
with the Tassels.
At breakfast, the morning after her first night in
the haunted room, she declared she had never slept
better or more soundly, that there had been no disturbance
of any kind, and that she adored the room.
       You saw and heard nothing?        queried Eve,
looking at her intently.
       Nixy,        and the pert little face was all smiles.
       But the game isn       t out till it       s played out, you
know.       
       I fail to grasp the cryptic meaning of that remark,       
said Eve, with an insolent stare at Zizi.
       Same here!        and the child       s eerie laugh rang
out.        But when I don       t know exactly what to say,
I sing out some old saw like that.       
[224]
Zizi       s laugh was infectious, and Milly giggled in
sympathy, while the others smiled too.
       The experience was mine, last night,        said Mr.
Tracy, in his deep, resonant voice.        I suppose I       d
better tell of it.       
       By all means,        said Penny Wise, as the clergyman
hesitated.
       A phantom appeared to me,        Tracy began,
       just as the hall clock struck four. I wasn       t
asleep, of that I       m sure, but I was suddenly aware
of a presence in the room. A tall, misty shape
seemed to take form as I looked, and it had the
appearance of a woman with a shawl over her head.
She drew near to me, and I could see her face, and
it was that of a skull. I was stunned, rather than
frightened, and when I tried to call out, I could
make no sound. The thing faded away as gradually
as it had appeared, and after a time I regained
a normal state of nerves. I don       t want to be an
alarmist, or frighten anybody, but I       well, I confess
I didn       t enjoy the experience, and I take occasion
to say now, that I shall leave here to-day.
I       m going to Boston, and will return at any time,
if for any reason my presence is desired or my
affidavit wanted as a witness. You all know what
I       ve thought about this whole matter. While not a
spiritualist, I       ve preserved an open mind toward any
revelations we may have had, and I       m always ready
to be convinced. And I may say the sight I saw
last night has gone far to convince me. But I don       t
care to see it again,        Tracy shuddered,        and at risk
of being thought cowardly, I       ve determined to go
away. I had intended to go shortly, anyway, and
I prefer to go to-day.       
[225]
       I don       t blame you, old chap,        said Braye, heartily;
       there       s no reason why you should jeopardize
your nervous system by exposing it to further
shocks. Let Mr. Wise take down the details of
your story, keep in touch with us as to your whereabouts
and where we can communicate with you,
and go ahead. I don       t blame you one bit. In fact,
if any one else wants to leave, no objections will be
made. How about you, Professor?       
       I want to stay, please. I       m terribly interested
in the matter, and I think Mr. Wise is making progress,
and will make more, rapidly. I       m anxious to
stay.       
       I       m game, too,        said Landon.        In fact I think
we all want to see it through, except Mr. Tracy, and
he is not so closely associated with the case as the
rest of us.       
So Tracy went, about noon of that day, and left
an address that he said would always reach him,
wherever he might be temporarily.
Milly and Norma regretted his going, for they
had come to like the grave, kindly man, but Eve
seemed not to care; and the men were all so interested
in the work of Penny Wise, that they only
gave a hearty good-bye and Godspeed to the departing
cleric.
[226]
       Queer, that spook should appear to him,        said
Wise, after Mr. Tracy had gone.
       He told me some time ago,        said Norma, reminiscently,
       that he often heard strange sounds at
four in the morning. He said they were like faint
moans and rustlings and sometimes a soft step along
the halls.       
       Did he ever see anything before?        asked Zizi.
       I don       t think so. He was not very communicative
about it, anyway. I think he was nervous
on the subject.       
       I know he was,        Eve spoke scornfully.        He
was afraid, I       m positive. No one ought to have
joined this party who was afraid.       
       We only asked him to fill in, you know,        said
Milly, rather apologizing for the minister       s timidity.
       And goodness knows, I       m afraid! Or I should
be, if Wynne weren       t always with me. If that
thing appeared to me,       well!       
Milly could find no words to express her horror,
and Landon looked at her anxiously.
       It won       t,        said Zizi, reassuringly,        it won       t,
Mrs. Landon.       
       How do you know?        said Eve, a bit abruptly.
[227]
       Your mama told my mama and my mama told
me,        returned Zizi, who could put such graphic
impudence into the silly phrase, that it was impossible
not to be amused at it.        Oh, do you do that,
too?        she added, as Eve bit her lip in annoyance.
       So do I! It       s such a hard habit to break, ain       t it?
But you oughtn       t to, it scars your lips. Now, Penny
Wise, if you       ll go for a walk and a talk with your
little otherwise, she       ll tell you sumpum that you
ought to know.       
       Look out, Ziz,        Wise said to her, as they
walked off by themselves, and followed the path by
the lake,        you mustn       t be too saucy to Miss Carnforth,
or there       ll be trouble.       
       Have to, honey. I       ve got to get her real mad at
me, to find out her secret. She       s no criminal, as
I       ve told you, but she knows who is.       
       Do you?       
       Not yet, but soon. Now, listen, while I expound
a few. Friend Spook did appear to me last
night.       
       Really?       
       Sure as shootin       ! I thought it over, and decided
I       d better not admit it to the gaping crowd,
or we       ll never find out who does the stunt.       
       But, really, Zizi?       
       Yes, really, Pen. It was about two o       clock,       not
four. A tall shape, draped in white, breezed in
and toddled around trying to attract my attention.
I lay there and looked sort of glassy-eyed, as if I
was awake, but kinda hypnotized, you know. Well,
I kept up that attitude, and the thing came nearer
and leaned over me, and sure enough it had a skull
for a face; but, land, Penny, it was a papier mach        
skull,       a mask, you know.        Twould be fine in the
movies, I must put Manager Reeves up to that
dodge!       
[228]
       Go on, Ziz.       
       Well, the thing,       the person, I mean, for it was
a real, live person all right,       sashayed around a bit,
then gave a hollow groan,       I guess that       s what they
call hollow,       and slid out. That       s all.       
       You       re a corker, Zizi! Why didn       t you yell?       
       I wanted to see the game. Then, when the
pleasant-faced visitor left, I knew it was because I
was supposed to have been sufficiently impressed. I
thought it over, and I decided that at breakfast, I       d
say I hadn       t seen anything, and see who looked self-conscious.
And, by jiminy! nobody did! If any
one around that table was my visiting spook, he or
she carried it off something marvellous! Not one
of        em flickered an eyelash when I said I       d had a
sweet, sound sleep all night. I can       t see how any
one could be so self-controlled. Now, Penny, could
it have been anybody who wasn       t at the breakfast
table?       
       Meaning Stebbins or the Thorpes?       
       Oh, no! none of them! But how about some
outsider, hired, you know, by somebody in the
house.       
       How       d he get in?       
       There       s a secret way into this house. You
needn       t tell me there isn       t. Just        cause you haven       t
stumbled over it yet! Also, who       s doing the hiring?       
[229]
       You said everything came around toward
Landon.       
       There       s motive there. You see, after Mr.
Braye, Mr. Landon inherits all the Bruce fortune,
and that       s millions.       
       What       s the matter with Braye being the murderer?
He inherits first.       
       That       s just it. If Mr. Braye wanted to kill his
relatives to get the fortune, he wouldn       t do it up
here, where he       s so liable to be suspected. He       d
invent some subtler way, or some less suspicious
scheme. But Mr. Landon could do it up here, and
feel sure the suspicion would fall on Mr. Braye.
Then, you see, Mr. Braye gets the money, and later
on, Mr. Landon puts him out, too. In some awfully
clever way, that can       t be traced to him, d       y        see?
And, too, Mr. Braye has declared he       ll give all the
money, if necessary, to discovering the criminal, if
there is one. And he said, he       d give what was left
to build a hospital. No, he doesn       t want the money
that came to him in such an awful way, leastwise,
not if it throws suspicion on him. He       s going to be
cleared, or he       s not going to use the money for himself.
Miss Carnforth told me all that, I       ve talked
a lot with her.       
       You       ve talked with all of them, haven       t you?       
[230]
       Yes, indeed. I       ve babbled on, and most often
they tell me a lot that they don       t realize. Mrs. Landon,
now, she       s struggling hard not to suspect her
own husband, but Miss Carnforth has said a few
things that scare Mrs. Landon        most to death. Oh,
Penny, it       s a fearful case! We must fix it up, we
must!       
       We will, Zizi. There       s so much evidence not
to be denied, that we must ferret out what it really
means. I       m getting a glimmer, but your help is
invaluable. That was a stroke of genius for you
not to tell of your ghost! Weren       t you frightened?       
       Not a bit. All I wanted to do, was to find out
who it was. But I didn       t dare grab at it, for I knew
it would get away. I hope it will come again. I       ll
try to make it speak, and maybe I       ll get a line on
the voice.       
       Was it a man or a woman?       
       I couldn       t tell. The draperies were long and
full, and the skull-mask covered the face.       
       Didn       t you see the hand?       
       It was lost in the draped shawl. But I       m sure
I       ll have another visit, and then I       ll get more
information. You think I did well, oh, Wise
Guy?       
       I do indeed!        and the approving smile that was
Zizi       s most welcome reward lighted up the detective       s
face.
Zizi pursued her plan of talking to the various
people separately. She gleaned much this way and
with her powers of lightning calculation, she put
two and two together with astounding results.
[231]
She even lured the old Professor into a t       te-        -t       te
conversation.
       No, I don       t believe those deaths were supernatural,
now,        he said, thoughtfully;        I did, but
it       s too incredible. However, it       s no more unbelievable
than that they could have been accomplished
by human power.       
       They were,        and Zizi       s black head nodded
affirmation.
       How, then?       
       By a diabolically clever genius. Tell me again,
Professor, just how those people were sitting?
Were they together?       
       Mr. Bruce and Vernie? No. There was the
width of the room between them.       
       Were you near either?       
       Yes, sitting next to Mr. Bruce. We were talking
absorbedly.       
       Had he tasted his tea?       
       I think he had taken one sip,       not more, I       m
sure.       
       There was poison in that tea, Professor.       
       There must have been, but how could there
be?       
       Who gave it to him?       
[232]
       Let me see; Miss Carnforth presided, as Mrs.
Landon was not at home. Miss Carnforth made
the tea, and poured the cups, and Vernie and Mr.
Tracy,       yes, and Mr. Landon were passing the
things around. It was all most informal, we never
have the servants in at tea-time. I couldn       t really
say just who did give Mr. Bruce his cup. Vernie
gave me mine, I think.       
       Well, the poison was put in Mr. Bruce       s cup,
after Miss Carnforth fixed it for him.       
       Bless my soul, do you think so? That lets
Braye out, then, for he wasn       t there.       
       You don       t suspect Mr. Braye, do you?       
       No; of course not; but I don       t really suspect
anybody. But Mr. Braye is the heir, you know,
and so may be said to have motive.       
       That is true of Mr. Landon,       in a way.       
       I can       t suspect either of those two,       it       s impossible.       
       Go on, Professor, tell me about the little girl       s
death.       
       You       ve heard it before.       
       I know, but every little helps.       
       She was across the room. I was looking at
Bruce, of course, when I heard an exclamation                     
       From whom?       
       I don       t know; Miss Carnforth, I think. Any
way, she and Tracy were bending over Vernie,       they
had laid her on a couch,       and in a moment,
they said she was dead. At the same time, Mr.
Bruce breathed his last. It was all so fearful, so
terrible, we were stunned. At least, I was, and
one by one we pulled ourselves together, trying to
realize what had happened.       
[233]
       All right, I know the rest. You       ve helped me
a little                     
       Do you suspect anybody? Does Mr. Wise?
Tell me, child. I can doubtless be of help, if I
know what to do.       
       No, Professor, you can       t help. It       s very awful,
but it will soon be clear to all. Heaven help that
poor Miss Carnforth.       
       Nonsense! Eve didn       t do it! Of that I       m
certain.       
       So am I. Of course, Miss Carnforth didn       t do
it. The tea was all right when she fixed Mr. Bruce       s
cup.       
       Then who tampered with it? Not Vernie!       
But Zizi had run away. She had a way of making
sudden exits and entrances, and one never knew
where she was or when she would appear.
That night Zizi declared that she hoped the ghost
would visit her. She said this openly, as the whole
crowd were preparing to go to their rooms for the
night.
       Perhaps it will,        said Wise, looking at her,
thoughtfully.        If it called on Mr. Tracy last
night, it may be here again to-night, and you may
be favoured. Are you not afraid?       
       Not of the ghost,        said Zizi,        but I am afraid
that some of you people may play a trick just to
scare me. Will you double up, so I can feel sure
there       s nothing of that sort?       
[234]
       I       ll take Mr. Tracy       s room,        said Mr. Wise,
       then I can keep my eye on Mr. Braye and Professor
Hardwick. Though I       ve no mental image
of either of them trailing round in sheets!       
       I should say not!        and Braye shuddered.
       No, Miss Zizi, you       ve nothing to fear from us.       
       Nor us,        Norma assured her.        I was going
to sleep in the room with Miss Carnforth, anyway,
and that will preclude either of us impersonating
a phantom.       
       What an awful idea,        and Eve glowered at
Zizi.        You don       t really think any of us would
stoop to such a despicable thing, do you?       
       You never can tell,        said Zizi, nonchalantly.
       Mrs. Landon, you won       t let your husband leave
your room, will you?       
       No,        said Milly, not at all resenting the question
which Zizi put to her in a gentle, pleading tone,
very different from that she had used to the
others.
And so, the inmates of the house being accounted
for, and the doors and windows looked after with
extra care and precaution, the household settled itself
to quietness, and the dark hours passed, ticked
off and struck by the great deep-toned clock in the
hall.
It was between two and three, when Zizi, watching,
perceived her door slowly and silently swing
open.
[235]
Determined to learn all possible as to who the
intruder could be, the girl lay motionless, but breathing
deeply as if asleep.
Her eyes, almost closed, yet took in every movement
of her silent visitor.
It was no white-robed ghost, but a tall figure, clad
in a long black cloak, and wearing a black mask.
With a swift stride, that betokened a man, the
figure approached the bed, having first softly closed
the door that led to the hall.
Watching covertly for the next development, Zizi
was all unprepared for what really happened.
The man, with a sudden, swift gesture, took the
girl       s chin in one strong hand, and opened her
mouth, while with the other he thrust in a thick soft
cloth, saturated with chloroform.
Not enough to make her lose her senses entirely,
it partially stupefied her, and the choking cloth prevented
all speech.
Whipping off the long dark cloak he wore, the
man flung it round Zizi, as he lifted the slender form
from the bed.
Vainly trying to emit a shriek, or utter a groan,
Zizi fell, half-conscious, back in the arms that supported
her.
[236]
After an unknown interval, a draught of cool air
on her face brought her back to a dim consciousness,
and she realized she was out of doors. A struggle
of her arms and legs resulted in a firmer grasp of
the strong arms that carried her, and she quit moving,
to think. She had been kidnapped, taken from
her bed, and had been carried out of doors, but she
had no knowledge of who her captor was nor by
what means they had left the house. Her brain
was furiously wide awake, but she made no move,
lest more chloroform be administered, and she lose
her regained consciousness.
On the shore of the black lake the man stopped,
and set her on her feet. Her mouth, still filled with
the soft cloth, was strained and painful, but the
first attempt to raise her hand resulted in its being
clutched by the strong hand of the man who swayed
her destiny.
So slender and light was she, that he handled her
as one might a child, and in his strong grasp she
was as powerless as an infant.
Working quickly and deftly, he tied a strong rope
round her ankles and to it attached what was only
too evidently a bag of stones or bricks.
Then, without a word, he flung her into the deep,
dark waters of the lake, and with one backward
glance, he walked away.
[237]
CHAPTER XVI
What Happened to Zizi
       Just like a kitten!        Zizi sputtered;        just like
a little, day-old kitten! Ugh! I       m as mad
as a wet hen!       
She was sitting on the bank of the lake, dripping
wet, daubed with mud, her black eyes snapping
with anger.
When she had been thrown into the pool, the big,
entangling cape had caught in the sedge grass that
bordered the water, and clutching this, the girl had
hung on till she could manage to slip her slim little
feet from the rope that bound them. A stiff rope
and clumsily tied, it had been possible to free herself,
though she might not have been able to do it,
but for her experiences as a moving picture actress.
It was not the first time she had been flung into
water, for her slim agility had proved useful in
film thrillers, and acrobatic feats were her long suit.
Able, too, to remain under water for a few moments
without breathing, she had freed herself from
the rope, and scrambled up the bank almost as rapidly
as she had been sent to her intended doom.
She had pulled the cloth from her mouth, and
sat, breathing in good air, but too exhausted to
rise.
[238]
       If he       d only spoken, drat him!        she muttered,
       and yet it must have been that wretch! I know
it was, but how can I prove it? Oh, I wish it
wasn       t so dark! And I       m so wet!       
She got up now, and tried to wring the water
from the cloak that she still clutched round her.
Beside that she had on her nightdress, and a thin
silk kimono, both of which were wetly clinging to
her slim little body.
Throwing the still soaking wet cloak about her,
and shivering as it sopped against her, she went
toward the house.
It stood, still and sombre, a black thing amid
blacker shadows. The aspen branches soughed
eerily, but no other sound broke the silence. The
great doors were closed, the windows all shut, and
no sign of life was visible.
Zizi hesitated. Should she whistle beneath
Penny Wise       s window, or              
The alternative she thought of seemed to her best,
and she drew her wet draperies about her and
scuttled off at a smart pace toward the village.
Barefooted as she was, she chose grassy ground
whenever possible, but her feet were sadly cut and
bruised before she reached her destination.
This was the house of Dan Peterson, and a ring
at his doorbell, brought the sound of a hastily flung-up
window, and a sharp        Who       s there?       
       Me,        said Zizi, truthfully,        please let me in.       
[239]
Not quite certain of the identity of his caller, but
touched by the pleading little voice, Peterson came
downstairs, followed by his wife.
A few words of explanation resulted in Zizi       s
being put into warm, dry clothes, and tucked into
bed by Mrs. Peterson, who admonished her to
       sleep like a baby till mornin       .       
Which, nothing loth, Zizi did.
Morning at Black Aspens brought a shock of
surprise.
It was Hester who first discovered the absence of
Zizi from the Room with the Tassels.
Hester had been fond of the child from the beginning,
and in spite of her fifteen years, and her
even older world-knowledge, Zizi was a child, in
many ways. Hester mothered her whenever possible,
though Zizi       s natural efficiency made little
assistance really necessary. But Hester loved to
wait on her, and so, this morning, when, going into
the room with a can of hot water, she found no
sleepy little occupant of the great bed, she ran
straight upstairs to Miss Carnforth       s room.
       Where       s that child?        she demanded as Eve
opened the door to her loud knock.
       What child? Who?       
       Zizi. She       s gone! Sperrited away! What
have you done with her?       
       Hush, Hester! You act crazy                     
       And crazy I am, if any harm       s come to that
girl! Where is she?       
[240]
Doors opened and heads were thrust out, as the
voice of the irate Hester was heard about the
house.
Penny Wise, in bathrobe and slippers, appeared,
saying,        What       s up? Zizi disappeared?       
       Yes,        moaned Hester,        her bed       s been slept in,
but she ain       t nowhere to be found. Oh, where can
she be?       
       Be quiet,        commanded Wise. He ran downstairs,
and examined the doors and windows
minutely. Except for those that Hester or Thorpe
had opened that morning, all were locked as they
had been left the night before.
       She may be in the house somewhere,        suggested
Norma, wide-eyed and tearful.
       Not she,        said Wise.        She would hear our
commotion, and come to us. Zizi is not one to play
mischievous tricks.       
       But how did she get out?       
       How did Vernie       s body get out?        asked Braye,
gravely.        There       s no chance for a human marauder
this time.       
       No,        and Professor Hardwick looked over the
great locks and bolts on the front doors, and examined
the window catches.
Pennington Wise looked very serious.
[241]
       Don       t talk any foolishness about spooks,        he
said, sternly;        I don       t want to hear it. Zizi has
been carried off by mortal hands, and if any harm
has been done her it will go hard with the villain
who is responsible!       
       Who could have done it       and why?        cried
Eve.
       Those who know the most about it, are often
the loudest in their lamentations,        Wise returned
and stalked off to his room.
Breakfast was eaten in a silence that seemed portentous
of impending trouble. Pennington Wise
was deep in thought and apparently had no knowledge
of what he was eating nor any consciousness
of the people about him.
During the meal a note was brought to him by a
messenger from the village. He read it and slipped
it in his pocket without a word.
After breakfast he requested the entire household,
including the servants, to gather in the hall.
He addressed them in grave, earnest tones, without
anger or undue excitement, saying, in part:
       I have made considerable progress in the investigations
of the tragedies that have occurred in this
house. I have learned much regarding the crimes
and I think I have discovered who the guilty party
is. I may say, in passing, that there is not, and
has not been any supernatural influence at work.
Any one who says that there has, is either blindly
ignorant of or criminally implicated in the whole
matter. The two deaths were vile and wicked
murders and they are going to be avenged. The
kidnapping of Zizi is the work of the same diabolical
ingenuity that compassed the deaths of two
innocent victims. A third death, that of my clever
child assistant, was necessary to prevent discovery,
hence Zizi       s fate.       
[242]
       Is she dead?        wailed Hester,        oh, Mr. Wise,
is she dead?       
       I will tell you what happened to her,        said Wise,
quietly.        She was taken from her bed in the so-called
haunted room, she was carried out of the
house, and a bundle of bricks was tied to her, and
she was thrown into the lake. That       s what happened
to Zizi.       
Milly screamed hysterically, Norma Cameron
cried softly and Eve Carnforth exclaimed, with
blazing eyes,        I don       t believe it! You are making
that up! How can you know it? Why didn       t you
rescue her?       
The men uttered various exclamations of incredulity
and horror, and the servants sat, aghast.
Pennington Wise surveyed rapidly one face after
another, noting the expression of each, and sighing,
as if disappointed.
       She is not dead,        he said, suddenly, and
watched again the telltale countenances.
       What!        cried Wynne Landon,        bricks tied to
her, and thrown in the lake but not drowned! Who
saved her life?       
       She herself,        returned Wise,        didn       t you,
Zizi?       
[243]
And there she was, in the back of the hall, behind
the group, every member of which turned to see
her. Peterson was with her, and the two came
forward.
Zizi was garbed in clothes that Mr. Peterson had
lent her, and though too large, she had pinned up
the plain black dress until it looked neither grotesque
nor unbecoming.
       Yes, I       m here,        she announced,        but only because
a bag o        bones can       t be sunk by a bag o       
bricks! Your Shawled Woman,       only he didn       t
have his shawl over his head,       carried me off about
as easy as he might have sneaked off a doll-baby!
Then,       shall I tell        em all, Pen?       
       Yes, child, tell it all, just as it happened.       
       Well, he stuffed a bale of cotton into my mouth,
which same was soaked with chloroform, so, naturally
I couldn       t yell; likewise, I didn       t know just
where I was at for a few minutes.       
       Who was he?        exclaimed Braye,        what did he
look like?       
       Was it the skull face?        asked Eve.
       Nixy on the bone face!        returned Zizi,        he
was a plain clothes man in civilian dress, with a
black mask over his patrician features.       
       Don       t you know who it was?        and Eve       s voice
was intense and strained.
[244]
       Not positively,        Zizi answered.        Well, he
picked me up like I was a feather, and how he got
out of the house I       ve no idea, but I felt a breeze of
night air, and there was I by the bank of the lake,
and there was he, busily engaged in tying a load of
bricks to my ankles!       
       Did you scream?        asked the Professor, absorbed
in the account.
       My dear man, how could I, with my mouth
chock-a-block with a large and elegant bundle of
gag? I was thankful that my wits were workin       ,
let alone my lung power! Well, he tossed me in
the nasty, black lake, and that       s where he spilled
the beans! For ground and lofty tumbling into
lakes is my specialty. I       m the humble disciple of
Miss Annette Kellerman, and not so awful humble,
either! So, I held my breath under water long
enough to wriggle my feet out of those ropes, the
old stupid didn       t know how to tie anything but a
granny slip knot! and I scrambled out, just as my
windpipe was beginning to go back on me.       
       You make light of it, Zizi, but it was a narrow
squeak,        said Wise, looking at her gravely.
       You bet it was! If he       d had a softer rope, I       d
been done for. It was the stiffness of that rope,
and       well, the stiffness of my upper lip,       that rescued
your little Ziz from a watery grave, and horrid
dirty old water, too!       
Wise slipped his arm round the child, and told
her to go on with the story.
       Then,        she proceeded,        I squz out what wetness
I could from my few scanty robes, in which
I was bedecked, and I borrowed the long cloak,
which friend Kidnapper had kindly wrapped me in.       
[245]
       What kind of a cloak?        asked Eve.
       Nothing very smart,        said Zizi, nonchalantly,
       looked to me like an old-fashioned waterproof,       the
kind they wore, before raincoats came in. Only,
it wasn       t waterproof, not by several jugs full! But
I wrung it out all I could, and then I tried to get in
the house. But,       it was all locked up, and as it
seemed a pity to disturb all you sound sleepers, I
ran to the village and begged a lodging with my
friend, Mr. Peterson. He and his wife were most
kind, and put me in a nice dry, little bed, that had
no tassels or ghosts attached to it. I sent Mr. Wise
a note, as soon as I could, so he wouldn       t worry.       
       That was the note I received at the breakfast
table,        Wise informed them.        Now, you see, there
is a real man at the bottom of the villainy going on
up here. He desired to remove Zizi, lest she discover
his crime, and I daresay, he planned to dispose
of me also, if he could manage it. His seems
to be a will that stops at nothing, that is ready to
commit any crime or any number of crimes to save
his own skin. Has anybody present any idea of the
identity of this man? Any reason to suspect any
one? Any light whatever to throw on the situation?       
       No!        declared Landon,        we have not! I speak
for myself, and for all present, when I say we have
no knowledge of a wretch answering to that description!
Nor did I suppose that such existed! Can
you track him down, Mr. Wise? Is your power
sufficient to discover and deal death to this beast
you describe?       
[246]
       I hope so,        and Penny Wise carefully scrutinized
the face of the speaker.        I think, Mr.
Landon, that with Zizi       s help, with the enlightenment
her awful experience gives us, I can get the
criminal and that in a short time.       
       Good!        exclaimed Hardwick.        I am not
vindictive, but I confess I never wanted anything
more than to see brought to justice the man who
could conceive and carry out such diabolical
crimes!       
       Are you sure they are one and the same?       
asked Braye,        I mean the man who killed Mr.
Bruce and Vernie, and the one who carried off
Miss Zizi?       
       Yes,        said Wise, thoughtfully.        There are
not two such, I should say. But the quest of one
person is my immediate business. If I find there
are others implicated, I shall get them, too. I am
not more incensed over the attack on Zizi than on
your two friends, but I don       t deny it has given
me an added wrong to avenge. But for the child       s
strong nerve, and clever quickness of action, she
would now lie at the bottom of the lake where                     
He stopped abruptly.
       Go away, all of you,        he said, in a low, strained
voice.        I mean, go about your business, but leave
me to myself for a time. Peterson, come in here.       
[247]
He went into the Room with the Tassels. Peterson
followed, and Zizi glided in beside them. The
door closed and the group left in the hall looked
at one another in perplexity and horror.
       I can       t understand, Wynne,        said Milly,        who
took Zizi away?       
       I don       t know, dear; what do you think, Professor?       
       I think in so many directions, that I       m sure none
of them is right. Awful things suggest themselves
to my mind, but I can       t believe them, and I dismiss
them, half thought out.       
       That       s the way with me,        sighed Braye.        It
looks now as if there must be some one who gets in
from outside the house, and who is responsible for
all the inexplicable happenings. Of course, that
would point to Stebbins, we must all admit that.       
The servants had left the hall, so Braye permitted
himself this freedom of speech.
       I don       t say it       s Stebbins,        the Professor mused,
       but I do think it       s some one from outside. There
may be a village inhabitant who is possessed of a
homicidal mania, that       s the theory that seems to me
the only one possible. And we must assume, now,
that there is a secret way to get in and out of the
house.       
       If so, that clever detective ought to find it,       
argued Braye.
[248]
       Perhaps he will,        said Hardwick,        also, perhaps
he has. He doesn       t tell all he knows. Now,
this is certain. All here present are, I am thankful
to say, free from any breath of suspicion. For last
night, you, Braye, and the detective and I all slept
with our doors open, and none of us could have left
our rooms without being observed by the others.
The same is true of the ladies, and of course, Mrs.
Landon can vouch for her husband.       
       Don       t talk that way,        said Norma, with a shudder.
       You know none of us could be suspected.       
       Not by ourselves,        agreed the Professor;        nor
by each other, of course. But by an outsider, or by
the servants, or by the detectives,       it is indeed a
good thing to have matters arranged as they are.
I feel a decided satisfaction in knowing that no unjust
suspicion can attach itself to any one of our
party.       
       That       s so,        and Braye nodded.        But it doesn       t
get us any nearer to the real criminal. I incline to
the Professor       s idea of a man of homicidal mania,
in the village. They say, that       s a real disease, and
that such people are diabolically clever and cunning
in carrying out their criminal impulses.       
       But how could such a man get in?        asked Eve,
her eyes wide with wonder.
       We don       t know,        said Braye,        but there must
be a secret entrance. Why, Stebbins as good as
admitted there was, but he wouldn       t tell where it
was. However, it       s unimportant, how he got in, if
he did get in.       
[249]
       Do you mean that some such person acted the
ghost,       and       all that?        said Norma, dubiously.
       But, if so, how could he kill Mr. Bruce and
Vernie? Oh, it       s too ridiculous! Those two
deaths were not occasioned by any crazy man from
East Dryden! It       s impossible.       
       Come out for a little stroll, Norma,        said Braye
to her, seeing how nervously excited the girl was.
       A breath of fresh air will do you good, and we
can do nothing here.       
They went out into the pleasant August sunshine,
and strolled toward the lake.
       Not that way,        begged Norma.        It       s too horrible.
Oh, Rudolph, who do you suppose tried to
drown that poor little Zizi?       
       Nobody, Norma. She made up that yarn.       
       Oh, no, Rudolph, I don       t think so!       
       Yes, she did. That Wise is trying to get at his
discoveries in the theatrical fashion all detectives
love to use, and that movie actress is part of his
stock in trade. She fell in the lake, all right, I
daresay, but the tale about the bogey man is fictitious,
be sure of that.       
       But how did she get out of the house, and leave
all the doors locked behind her?       
       Perhaps, as the Professor suggested, Wise
knows of the secret entrance, if there is one, and
of course, Zizi does too. Or, that little monkey
could have scrambled down from the second-story
window, she       s as agile as a cat! Anyway, Norma,
she wasn       t pitched in the lake by the same villain
that did for Uncle Gif and Vernie.       
[250]
       Who could that have been?       
       Who, indeed?       
       Rudolph, tell me one thing,       please be frank;
do you think any one we know       is,       is responsible
for those deaths?       
Braye turned a pained look at her.        Don       t ask
such questions, dear,        he said.        I can       t answer
you,       I don       t want to answer.       
       I am answered,        said Norma, sadly.        I know
you share the       the fear, I won       t call it a suspicion,       that
Eve and I do. And       Rudolph, Milly fears
it, too. She won       t say so, of course, but I know
by the way she looks at Wynne, when she thinks
no one notices. And she       s so afraid Mr. Wise will
look in that direction. Oh, Rudolph, must we let
that detective go on,       no matter what he       exposes?       
       Landon got him up here,        said Braye,        no, the
Professor really heard of him first, but Landon
urged his coming.       
       Milly didn       t. Could Wynne have been
prompted by       by bravado?       
       I don       t know, dear. Please don       t talk of it,
Norma. It seems                     
       I know, it seems disloyal to Wynne for us even
to hint at such a thing. But if we could help
him                     
       How?       
[251]
       Oh, I don       t know. I suppose we oughtn       t to
condone,       and, too, Rudolph, if this should remain
undiscovered, should be all hushed up, you know,
and if nobody should really accuse       you know who       wouldn       t
your life be in danger?       
       Hush, Norma, I won       t listen to such talk! Has
Eve put you up to all this?       
       She and I have talked it over, yes. She is so
anxious for you.       
       For me?       
       Yes; you know Eve       cares a great deal for
you.       
       Hush, dear, you       re not yourself to-day. And
I don       t wonder. The awful times we       re going
through are enough to upset your nerves. But
never speak of Eve Carnforth and me in that tone!
You know, Norma, I love you and you only. I
want you for my own, my darling, and when we
get away from these awful scenes, I shall woo and
win you!       
[252]
CHAPTER XVII
Stebbins Owns Up
       Now, Mr. Stebbins, you       d better speak
out in meetin        and tell all you know.
Tell your Auntie Zizi jes        how naughty
you was, and how you managed it. C       mon, now,              pit
it all out!       
Zizi sat on the edge of a chair in Elijah Stebbins       
office, and leaned toward him, her eerie little face
enticingly near his, and her smile such as would
charm the birds off the trees.
Stebbins looked at her, and shifted uneasily in
his chair.
       I didn       t do nothin        wrong,        he began,        I played
a silly trick or two, but it was only in fun. When
I see they took it seriously, I quit.       
       Yes, I know all that,        and the impatient visitor
shook a prompting little forefinger at him.        I
know everything you said and did to scare those
people into fits, and when they wouldn       t scare, but
just lapped up your spook rackets, you quit, as you
say, and then,       they took up the business themselves.       
       You sure of that?       
[253]
       I am,       certain. Also, I know who did it.
What I       m after is to find out a few missing ways
and means. Now, you were a tricksy Puck,
weren       t you, when you moved the old battered
candlestick that first night? And it did no harm,
that I admit. It roused their curiosity, and started
the spook ball rolling. Then, as a ghost, you appeared
to Mr. Bruce, didn       t you?       
       Well, I       did,        Stebbins grudgingly confessed,
forced by the compelling black eyes,        I just wrop
a shawl over my head, and spooked in. But nobody
believed his yarn about it.       
       No; they thought Mr. Bruce made up the story,
because he had said he would trick them if he could.       
       Yep, I know that,        agreed Stebbins, eagerly.
       Then once again, I played spook, and that time,
Miss Carnforth was a sleepin        in that ha       nted room.
You see, I expected it would be one o        the men, and
when I see a woman                     
       You were more scared than she was!        Zizi
leaned eagerly forward, almost spilling off her
chair, in her interested attention.
       I believe I was,        said Stebbins, solemnly.
       Anyways, I went out, vowin        never to do any
more spook work,       and I never did.       
       All that tallies with my discoveries so far,       
Zizi nodded,        now what I       m after, is the way you
got in.       
       That       s a secret,        and Stebbins squirmed
uneasily.
       A secret entrance, you mean?       
[254]
       Yes       m. And how to get into it is a secret that
has been known only to the owner of that house, for
generations,       ever since it was built. Whenever
anybody bought it or inherited it, he was told the
secret entrance, and sworn never to tell of it.       
       But, look here, Mr. Stebbins, your entrance to
that house, or whatever it is, was seen by somebody.
That somebody used it afterward, and played ghost,
and committed crime, and even stole the body of
that poor little girl away. Also, some one carried
me,       me! if you please, out by that secret passage,
and tried to drown me! Now, do you think it is
your duty to remain silent, because of that old oath
of secrecy?       
Zizi had risen and stood over him like a small but
terrifying avenging angel. If she had brandished a
flaming sword, it could not have impressed Eli
Stebbins more than her burning black eyes        glance.
Her long, thin arms were outspread, her slim
body poised on tiptoe and her accusing, condemning
face was white and strained in its earnestness.
       No, ma       am, I don       t!        and Stebbins rose, too.
       Come with me, Miss; I       ll go with you and I       ll
show you that secret entrance, nobody could ever
find it alone, and I       ll own up to all I did, wrong or
right. I       m no murderer, and I       ll not put a straw
in the way of findin        out who is.       
In triumph, Zizi entered the hall of Black Aspens,
leading her captive. Though it must be admitted
Stebbins came willingly.
[255]
       This here       s my house,        he said, with an air of
importance,        and so far       s I       m responsible for queer
goin       s on, I       ll confess. And after that, you, Mr.
Detective, can find out who carried on the hocus-pocus.       
       Thank you, Mr. Stebbins,        said Pennington
Wise, gravely.        Suppose we ask all the members
of the household to be present at your revelations.       
       Not the Thorpes, or them servant maids, if you
please. They ain       t none of        em implicated, and
why let        em know what       s goin        on?       
       That       s right,        said Zizi.        Whatever we learn
may not be entirely given to the public. Just call
the rest of the party, Pen.       
As it happened, the men were all in the hall talking
with Wise when Stebbins arrived, so Zizi went
in search of the women. They were congregated
in Milly       s room, and as they came downstairs, the
detective noted their expressions, a favourite
method with him of gaining information.
Milly       s round little face was so red and swollen
with weeping, that it excited only compassion in
any observer. Norma, too, was sad and frightened-looking,
but Eve was in a defiant mood, and
her scarlet lips were curved in a disdainful smile.
       As we       re all at one in our search for the criminal,       
Wise began, tactfully,        I think it best that
we should hear, all together, Mr. Stebbins        explanation
of how this house may be entered from outside,
though apparently locked and bolted against intrusion.       
[256]
       I should think, Mr. Wise,        said Eve, scornfully,
       that if there were such a possibility, your
detective genius ought to have discovered it.       
       He couldn       t,        said Stebbins, simply.        It ain       t
a means that any one could discover.       
       Then how did the criminal find it out?        demanded
Eve.
       He must have seen me come in by it,        Stebbins
replied.        Nobody could ever suspect the real
way.       
       Oh, come now,        said Zizi,        Mr. Wise does
know. He is not at all vain glorious, or he would
tell you himself. But he prefers to let Mr. Stebbins
tell.       
       Is that so, Mr. Wise?        asked Professor Hardwick,
eagerly.        If you have discovered the secret
entrance, I wish you would say so. I feel chagrined
that my own reasoning powers have given me no
hint.       
       I have satisfied myself of the means and the
location of the entrance,        Wise returned,        but I
have not examined the place definitely enough to
find the hidden spring that must be there.       
       You know that much!        cried Stebbins, in
amazement.
[257]
       Yes, largely by elimination. There are no
hollow walls, no false locks, no sliding panels,       it
seems to me there is no logical hidden entrance,
but through one of those columns,        and he pointed
to the great bronze columns that flanked the doorway.
       By golly!        and Stebbins stared at the speaker.
       You       ve hit it, sir!       
       I could, of course, find the secret spring, which
must be concealed in the ornamentation,        Wise went
on,        but I       ve hesitated to draw attention to the
columns by working at them. Suppose we let Mr.
Stebbins tell us, and not try to find what we know
must be cleverly concealed.       
       But wait a minute,        pleaded Hardwick.        I       m
terribly interested in this proof of Mr. Wise       s perspicacity.
You needn       t touch the column, but tell
us your theory of its use. Is there a sliding opening
in the solid bronze?       
       I think not,        and Wise smiled.        I may be all
wrong, I really haven       t looked closely, but my belief
is that one or both of those great columns, which, as
you see, are half in and half out of the hall, must
swing round, revolve, you know,       and so open a
way out.       
       Exactly right!        and Stebbins sprang toward
the column that was on the side of the hall toward
the Room with the Tassels.        That       s the secret.
Nobody ever so much as dreamed of it before! See,
you merely press this acorn in this bronze oak
wreath, half-way up, press it pretty hard, and the
column swings round.       
[258]
They crowded closer to see, and learned that the
column was made in two half sections, one in the
hall and one outside. These, again, were divided
horizontally, about seven feet above the floor, and
the joint concealed by a decorative wreath of
bronze oak boughs.
The column was hollow, and one half the shaft
revolved within the other, which, in turn, revolved
over the first, so that by successive movements of
the two, one could pass right through the vestibule
wall, and close the opening after him, leaving no
trace of his entry or exit. The vestibule wall, of
mahogany, concealed the longitudinal joint in the
column when closed. The doors were hinged to
this wooden wall, and were opened and closed, and
locked, quite independently of the columns. Owing
to perfectly adjusted ball bearings, and a thoroughly
oiled condition, the mechanism worked easily
and soundlessly.
       The whole contraption was brought from
Italy,        Stebbins informed them,        by the original
Montgomery. I don       t think he ever used it for
any wrong doings, though they do say, soldiers was
smuggled through in war times, and contraband
smuggling went on, too. But those is only rumours
and probably exaggerated.       
       You exaggerated the ghost stories, too, didn       t
you, Mr. Stebbins?        asked Wise.
[259]
       I didn       t need to, sir. Those yarns of the
Shawled Woman, have been told and retold so many
years now, they       ve grown way beyond their first
facts, if there ever was any truth to        em. This
here column, only one of        em revolves,       has always
been kept secret, but when the little witch child
made me see it was my duty to tell of it, tell of
it I did. Now, sir, go ahead and find who committed
them dastardly murders and I       ll consider I
did right to break my oath of secrecy.       
       No one will blame you for it,        said Professor
Hardwick, who was still experimenting with the
revolving column.        This is a marvellous piece of
workmanship, Landon. I never saw such before.       
Pennington Wise was covertly watching all the
faces as the various ones peered into the opening
left when the column was turned. He stood on
guard, too, and when Eve curiously bent down to
open a long box, which stood up on end, against the
inside of the bronze cylinder, he reached ahead of
her.
       Yes,        he said, consentingly,        let us see what
is in here.       
In full view of all, he opened the long box, such
a box as long stemmed roses might have been packed
in, and took from it a voluminous cloak of thin
white material, a flimsy, white shawl, and a mask
that represented a skull.
       The paraphernalia of the Shawled Woman,       
the detective said, exhibiting the things,        your property,
Mr. Stebbins?       
[260]
       Yes, they are,        and the man looked shame-faced,
but determined.        I made all my plans, before
the folks came up here, to ha       nt the Room with
the Tassels. I meant no harm, I vow. I thought
they was a silly set of society folks, who believed in
spooks, and I thought I       d give        em what they come
for. I bought the mask at a fancy shop in town,
and the thin stuff too. The shawl is one my wife
used to have. I own up to all my doin       s, because
while they was foolish, and maybe mean, they
wasn       t criminal. Now, if so be       s somebody saw
me go in and out, and used those ghost clo       es, which
it seems they must have done, I       ll help all I can to
fasten the guilt where it belongs.       
       I, too,        declared Rudolph Braye.        It certainly
looks as if some one had seen Mr. Stebbins
enter the house secretly, and watching, saw him
leave. Then, this night prowler tried the game
himself.       
       Yes, sir,        replied Stebbins.        Just the same
sort of spring, inside and out. Anybody seein        me
go through, either way, could easily work out the
secret. But, not knowing of it, nobody       d ever
suspect.       
       Of course not,        agreed Braye.        Now, we have
a start, let us get to work on the more serious aspect
of the affair. For, while this revelation explains
the entrance of some midnight marauder, with intent
to frighten us, it doesn       t do much toward lessening
the mystery of those two deaths.       
[261]
       You       re sure, Mr. Stebbins,        and Eve turned
glittering eyes on him,        that you never        haunted       
after that night when you appeared to me! You
know a ghost appeared to Vernie after that. Can
we believe that was not the work of the same
malignant                     
       Malignant is not the word to apply to Mr.
Stebbins,        Pennington Wise interrupted her,        and
it is up to us,       to me, to find who took his place as
haunter of this house. Also, who it was that removed
the body of Vernie Reid, doubtless through
the revolving column, and       who kidnapped and
tried to drown Zizi.       
       Those are secondary problems,        said Braye,
thoughtfully gazing at the detective.        But they
must be solved, too, of course. What I       m more
anxious about, however, is to learn how any one
could compass the murders,       if murders they
were.       
       Of course they were,        said Hardwick.        Now
that I know as much as I do know, I       m sure we       ll
learn all. Mr. Wise, I       m of a detective bent, myself,
and you may count on me to help you all I
can. You needn       t laugh                     
       My dear Professor Hardwick, I assure you I       ve
no thought of laughing, or of belittling the help you
offer. I       m truly glad of your assistance and it is
my habit to be frank with my clients, so we need
have no reservations, on either side. The assurance
we have received that an intruder could and did
enter the house, gives us new directions in which
to look and new theories to pursue. I       m sure you
will all agree with me that the body of Miss Reid
was carried out through the secret column, and not
removed by supernatural means.       
[262]
       Without doubt,        said Rudolph Braye, but Eve
Carnforth looked a denial.
       I can       t agree,        she said,        that the discovery of
a secret entrance disproves all possibility of the
presence of supernatural agencies. I think no
human intruder can be held responsible for all we
have been through. How do you account for two
deaths occurring at the very moment they were foretold?       
Her question was evidently addressed to Wise,
and he replied,        I think, Miss Carnforth, that those
two deaths were murders, cleverly accomplished by
human wills, and it is my immediate duty to prove
this. Therefore, I am now going to endeavour to
recover the missing body of the unfortunate girl
who was killed.       
       What! Vernie       s body!        and Eve gasped.
       Yes. And not wishing to do anything to which
you may not all agree, I announce frankly that I
am going to have the lake dragged.       
       The lake!        cried Wynne Landon,        why, man,
it is miles long!       
       But I think that the same person who tried to
drown Zizi is responsible for the disappearance of
Miss Reid       s body, and I feel sure that if we look in
that same part of the lake we will find what we
are after.       
[263]
       Incredible!        exclaimed Landon.        You will
only waste your time!       
Wise looked closely at the face of the speaker,
and then turned quickly to observe another face.
       At any rate, it can do no harm to try,        he said,
finally.
       Not at all,        said Braye;        go ahead. But even
the recovery of Vernie       s body, will get us no nearer
to her murderer. I wish I had been here at the
time of those deaths. While I cannot feel I should
have been of any help, I do think I could have
noticed something or formed some opinion or conclusion
from the circumstances.       
       No, Rudolph,        said the Professor.        There
was nothing to be seen or deduced from anything
that happened at that time. I was nearest to Mr.
Bruce, Miss Carnforth was nearest to Vernie.
Neither of us saw anything suspicious or of unexplainable
intent.       
       And yet Mr. Bruce was poisoned,        said Wise,
glancing from one face to another.        And I feel
positive Miss Reid was also poisoned. She must
have been. What else could have killed her, like
that?       
       True enough,        and Braye nodded his head.
       But do you think an examination of her body,
after all this time, could prove that?       
[264]
       Whether it could or not,        said Wise,        we want
to recover the body if possible. My theory is that
it must have been thrown in the lake. If it was
taken away through the revolving column, what else
could have been done with it? To bury it would
have been to risk discovery. And Zizi       s experience                     
       Are you sure, Mr. Wise, that Zizi       s experience
was truthfully related? May she not have been
hysterically nervous, and imagined the whole thing?
I       ve heard of such cases.       
       Who put you up to that idea, Miss Carnforth?       
said Wise, very quietly, and Eve flushed and turned
aside, remaining silent.
Pennington Wise       s theory proved the true one.
The men employed to drag the lake at Black
Aspens succeeded in finding the body of Vernie
Reid. A bag of bricks had been tied to the ankles,
in the same manner as described by Zizi, and the
little form had been sunk in almost the same place
that Zizi had been flung into the water.
Reverent hands carried the body to the house, and
later it was examined by a skilled physician from
New York City.
He reported that death had ensued upon the girl       s
arm being scratched with some sharp implement,
which had been previously dipped in a powerful
poison.
As this was the same physician who had passed
the final judgment on the cause of Mr. Bruce       s
death, his report was listened to with confidence and
belief.
[265]
       You must know,        he said, to the awed group,
       that about last March, a plot was formed against
some high officials in England. These diabolical
plans included the use of extremely poisonous drugs.
By a most culpable oversight the names and descriptions
of these poisons crept into the public press,
and since then, several attempts at their use have
been made, mostly, I am glad to say, without
result.
       But, it is clear to me, that the murderer of these
two people, Mr. Bruce, and the child, Vernie Reid,
used the poisons I have told you of.       
       I read about them,        said Pennington Wise.
       They included a rare drug only to be obtained
from South America.       
       That was the statement,        said the doctor,        but
I       m credibly informed there is a supply secretly
hoarded in this country. However that may be, I
am convinced that was the means used in Miss
Reid       s case. This poison must be introduced under
the skin, by means of a cut or scratch, whereupon,
the effect is instantaneously fatal. Twenty seconds
is said to be the extreme length of time for life to
remain in a body after the introduction of the
venom. There is a distinct scratch on Miss Reid       s
upper right arm, so inflamed and poisoned as to
leave no doubt in the matter.       
       That       s why the body was removed,        said the
Professor,        lest that scratch be discovered.       
[266]
       Yes,        agreed Wise,        and the other victim, Mr.
Bruce, was killed by having the poison introduced
into his stomach.       
       That was a different poison,        said the doctor.
       That was strychnine hydrochlorate, which acts
with equal speed. The evidential point is, that
these two poisons were both plotted to be used in
the case I mentioned in England, which, however,
was foiled before it was actually attempted. The
grave wrong, was the account in the newspapers,
which was so circumstantial and definite as to give
information to whoever cared to use it. Can any
one doubt that the villain in this case, read the
article I speak of, which was in several of our
American papers, and made use of his ill-gotten
directions to achieve his purpose?       
       How did it get into Mr. Bruce       s stomach?       
demanded Braye.
       It was secretly placed in his tea or in the cake
he was eating,        declared the doctor.        Don       t ask
me how,       or who did it. That is not my province.
But whoever could plan these fearsome deeds, could
find an ingenious method of carrying out his plans,       of
that I       m sure.       
       I wish I       d been present,        said Braye, again, as
he sighed deeply.
[267]
CHAPTER XVIII
Another Confession
Pennington Wise and Zizi sat in the hall
talking. It was part of Wise       s policy never to
hold secret conclaves with his little assistant,
for, he said that the people who employed him were
entitled to all his suspicions or deductions as they
took shape and grew in his mind. Professor Hardwick
joined them as Wise was saying,        What first
turned your attention to the Room with the Tassels,
Ziz? Why did you move into that room to sleep?       
       Because the lock was oiled,        Zizi replied, her
black eyes glistening.        The first time I got a
chance I looked at all the locks in the house, and
only two were freshly oiled, and they had been well
looked after,       I can tell you.       
       What did that prove to you?        Hardwick asked.
[268]
       That somebody was haunting the Room with
the Tassels who had to open the door to get in. No
ghost would need to turn a knob and open the door.
They splash right through walls or anything, or they
ought to, if they know their business! But this
lock, as well as the knob, was oiled, and, as you
know, the door was opened though locked on the
inside. Clever fingers can turn a key from the
other side, if they have a certain implement, used
by burglars. Also, if the key was not in the door,
clever people could provide a duplicate key. But
these things are not necessary for ghosts. They
just glide in serenely, not even thinking about keys
or doors.       
       You       re right, child,        and Wise nodded approvingly
at her.        Now, what other door had its lock
oiled?       
       Not only the lock, but the hinges of one of the
bedroom doors were carefully oiled. You know
which one, Penny.       
       I do, Zizi. Have you no suspicion, Professor?       
       I       d rather not say. As a friend of all the
people in our party, I simply can       t bring myself to
mention the name of any one of them, and, yet if
one of us is a criminal, it is the duty of the others
to see justice done.       
       Well, it must soon come out, anyway. It is
Mr. Tracy       s door, isn       t it, Zizi?       
       Yes.       
       Bless my soul!        cried the Professor,        Tracy!
Why, he       s a minister!       
       No,        and Penny Wise shook his head,        Mr.
Tracy is not a minister and never was. On the
contrary, he       s about as far removed from piety of
any sort, as any man on God       s green earth!       
       What are you saying?        cried Eve Carnforth,
coming swiftly toward them.        Mr. Tracy not a
minister!       
[269]
       No;        repeated Wise,        John Tracy is a notorious
criminal, known as Smug Johnny by his
friends, and also by the police. I have just had
returns from some inquiries I sent to Chicago, and
I learn that this double-dyed villain is wanted on
several counts, but never before has he been accused
of murder.       
       And did he kill Mr. Bruce and Vernie?        cried
Eve, her hands clenched in excitement and her long
eyes narrowed with fear.
       He did, I am positive. We have yet to prove
it, but I have evidence enough                     
       Where is he?        said Hardwick, abruptly.
       Under strict surveillance,        returned Wise.
       My men are at his heels day and night. He
can       t get away.       
       He stole me,        said Zizi;        you see I had my eye
on him,        cause of his oiled door. Then when he
came, I thought he was only going to scare me, but
he stuffed that old chloroform in my mouth so quick,
I couldn       t even yell out. If I hadn       t had some
experience in swimming pools and movie thrillers,
I       d been down at the bottom of that horrid old lake
this minute!       
       But I can       t understand,        and Eve looked
puzzled;        why would Mr. Tracy kill those people,
and how did he do it? Mr. Wise, you       re crazy!
It       s an impossible theory!       
[270]
Others had gathered in the hall, now, and Pennington
Wise told them all of his recent advices
from Chicago, that proved the supposed clergyman
a fraud and a villain.
Milly showed the greatest relief.        Oh,        she
cried,        I       m glad you       ve found out who it was, anyway!
But it doesn       t seem as if Mr. Tracy could
be a bad man       are you sure, Mr. Wise?       
       Yes, Mrs. Landon, there is no doubt at all.
Now, let us reconstruct the scene of those two
deaths. Where was Mr. Tracy sitting?       
       Right here, where I am now,        said Norma,
thinking back.        Vernie was over there, near the
front door. Mr. Bruce was across the hall by
Professor Hardwick, and Eve was in the middle of
the room by the tea-table.       
       Will you be so kind, Miss Carnforth, as to
think very carefully,        said Wise,        and see if you
recollect Mr. Tracy       s presence near you as you were
fixing the various cups of tea. Did he have the
slightest opportunity to add anything to the cup
that was afterward handed to Mr. Bruce?       
Excited, almost hysterical, Eve obeyed the detective       s
command, and said, after a moment       s thought,
       Yes, he did. I remember he passed near me, and
Vernie stood at my side also. They had a bit of
good-natured banter as to which should take the
cup I had just poured out, and Vernie won, and she
laughingly carried it to Mr. Bruce. I remember it
distinctly.       
[271]
       Then, doubtless, at that moment, Tracy dropped
the small amount of poison necessary in the cup,
sure that it would be given to Mr. Bruce. Had
Vernie given it to any one else, he would have intercepted
it. He is a man of suave manners, you
know.       
       Yes,        said Norma,        particularly so, and very
graceful about any social matters. He always assisted
in passing the tea things.       
       Go on,        said Penny Wise;        what happened as
Mr. Bruce took his first sip of tea?       
       He changed countenance at once,        said Hardwick.
       I was talking to him, and a queer pallor
came over his face and then it turned fiery red. He
dropped his cup and                     
       One moment,        said Wise;        what became of
that broken cup?       
       I       ve no idea,        said the Professor, helplessly
looking about him.
       I wasn       t home,        began Milly,        Mr. Braye and
I had gone to East Dryden                     
       The tray was taken out as usual,        interposed
Eve, but Norma said, quietly,        I picked up the
broken bits and laid them on the tray.       
       Call in the servant who took away that tray,       
said Wise, shortly.
Old Thorpe was called in, and told his story.
       I came in for the tray,        he said,        and seein              what
I did see       I was fair knocked out. I did
as usual, and picked up the tray to carry it to the
kitchen. Mr. Tracy was by the tray at the time,
and he was pourin        hot water into the teacups. I
don       t think the man knew what he was about,       none
of us did, and small wonder!       
[272]
Thorpe knew nothing of the recent developments
regarding Tracy, and Wise pursued:        Do you remember
whether Mr. Tracy poured hot water over
the broken cup?       
       That       s just what he was doin       , sir, that       s why I
thought he didn       t rightly know what he was about.       
       You may go, Thorpe,        said Wise.
       You see,        he continued after the old man had
gone,        Tracy poured boiling hot water from the
afternoon teakettle over the broken cup, that all
evidence of poison might be removed, if the bits
of china were examined. I       ve not heard of that being
done, however, but a guilty conscience would
naturally fear it. That little incident shows the
astuteness of his criminal mind.       
       It does!        cried Professor Hardwick.        What
a depraved, a demoniacal nature must be his!
Where did he come from? Who introduced him
to our party?       
[273]
       I did,        said Rudolph Braye.        I had, of
course, no suspicion of his real nature. I met
Tracy on the train, travelling from Chicago to New
York, about a year ago. He was a pleasant smoking
room companion, and I       ve seen him several
times since, in New York. I had no reason to
think him other than what he represented himself,
a clergyman, with a church in Chicago. He impressed
me as a fine, congenial sort, and when Mrs.
Landon asked me to suggest another member for
our house party, I thought of him at once. His
cloth seemed to me to be his adequate credentials
and, in fact, I never gave a thought to his possible
duplicity! Nor can I reconcile the facts, even yet.
How do you know these things, Mr. Wise? Are
you not romancing a little?       
       No, Mr. Braye, I am not even surmising. What
I have stated is true, because there is no other possible
deduction from the facts I have learned. I
have identified the man Tracy who was here with
you as the notorious Smug Johnny of Chicago. Do
you need further knowledge of him to believe that
he is the criminal in this case, rather than one of
your own immediate circle?       
       No,        and Milly shuddered;        it is bad enough
that it should have been Mr. Tracy, but far better
than to suspect one of us here.       
       Furthermore,        continued Wise,        let us look
into the details of the death of Vernie Reid. Who
can give me the exact facts as noticed?       
       I,        said Eve Carnforth;        and, now, as I look
back, I see it all in a different light! I was looking
at Mr. Bruce, as everybody was, startled by the
sound of crashing china, and I heard Mr. Tracy
say,        Vernie, child! What is the matter?        or some
such words. Then he ran quickly to her side and
held her up in his arms, while I ran to them and
helped him to lay her on the sofa.       
[274]
       See?        said Wise;        at the moment Tracy
sprang toward the girl she was unharmed, and as
he put his arm round her, he scratched her arm with
a sharp pointed instrument, which had been dipped
in the awful poison that we have learned of. It is
said to be similar to that with which the barbarians
of South America tip their arrows. But the least
scratch is instantly fatal, and proved so in Vernie       s
case. The instrument he used, we have reason to
think, was a steel pen.       
       Why do you think that?        asked Professor
Hardwick.
       Because Zizi found a few new ones in Tracy       s
room, that had not been used for writing purposes.
There were five in a small paper parcel. We have
found that he bought these at a shop in the village,
buying six at the time. This is merely a shred of
evidence, but the fact that Zizi found the pens became
known to Mr. Tracy, in fact he caught her
searching his room. It was this that made him try
to do away with the child.       
       Tracy? Do away with Zizi!        exclaimed
Braye.        Why, he was gone away from here,
then.       
       No. He had left the house, but he was lurking
about, and after all had retired that night, he came
through the revolving column, and kidnapped Zizi,
and threw her into the lake,       as he had previously
thrown in the body of Vernie Reid. That, he did,
lest the scratch on her arm be discovered by the
doctors, and he be suspected.       
[275]
       Then it was Tracy who discovered the secret
of the revolving column,        said Braye, thoughtfully.
       You take a great deal for granted, Mr. Wise.       
       I take nothing for granted, save what the facts
prove, Mr. Braye. That Tracy used the revolving
column is positive. Do you not all remember the
night when Professor Hardwick saw the apparition
of the Shawled Woman? On that night Mr. Tracy
was supposed to be in Boston. As a matter of
fact, he was not, he had left the house, saying he
was going to Boston but he remained in hiding near
the house, played ghost, and then went on his way.       
       I was in New York that night,        said Braye,
musingly.        But, look here, Mr. Wise, one afternoon,
about dusk, Miss Cameron and I distinctly
saw the apparition of the Shawled Woman in the
Room with the Tassels when we ourselves were out
of doors. We saw it through the window,       don       t
you remember, Norma?       
       I do,                     
       Then that was Mr. Tracy       s doings also,        declared
Wise.        How simple for him to get the
paraphernalia from the column, where it was always
in readiness, make his appearance to frighten you
two, and then return the shawl and so forth before
you could enter and catch him.       
       It would have been possible,        agreed Braye, and
then Hardwick began.
[276]
       There were many other strange things to be
accounted for, such as moanings and rustlings in
the morning at four o       clock, and also occasional
odours of prussic acid, without apparent reason.       
       Lay them all to Tracy,        said Wise,        you won       t
be far out. Now, who was running that Ouija
board the night it said the two people would die
at four o       clock?       
       Vernie and Mr. Tracy,        said Norma,        but
when it said that, Mr. Tracy took his hands off
and said he would have no more to do with it. He
said he believed Vernie pushed it to those letters.       
       He was a good actor,        said Wise, looking grave
and sighing;        he fooled you all, it would seem.       
       He certainly fooled me, good and plenty,        said
Braye, angrily.        You say you have him in custody,
Mr. Wise?       
       I did not say that, but I have him under such
surveillance that he cannot get away. There are
some other matters to be discussed. Granting
Tracy       s guilt, what do you ascribe as a motive?       
There was a profound silence. What could have
been the motive for a perfect stranger to kill with
deliberation two people who had never injured him
in any way, and from whose death he could expect
no pecuniary advantage?
       Look here,        said Wynne Landon, suddenly,
       Mr. Tracy went away from here because the
spectre appeared to him. How do you account for
that?       
[277]
       Mr. Tracy said so,        returned Wise,        but that
story of his ghostly vision was made up out of the
whole cloth,       which was all of the        cloth        with
which he ever had to do.       
       He made up that yarn, then, as an excuse to
get away?        said Hardwick.
       He did just that,        replied Wise.        But what
has any one to suggest as Mr. Tracy       s motive for
the crimes he committed?       
       Plain homicidal mania,        offered Hardwick, at
last, as no one else spoke.
       No,        said Wise,        John Tracy is not of that
type. Such people are abnormal, they have special
physical characteristics, and they are easily recognized,
once suspicion is attached to them. Tracy is
a quiet, even debonair character, he is even-tempered,
gentle-mannered and though deeply clever
he hides it under a mask of kindliness and consideration.
Victims of what is called homicidal
mania are not at all like this. They are difficult to
get along with, they do queer, inexplicable things,
and most of all, they show in their faces the traits
that lead them to their villainous deeds. You all
know Tracy is not of this type. Therefore you
must look further for his motive.       
       Did he receive any bequest from Mr. Bruce       s
will?        asked Hardwick, wonderingly.
       Certainly not,        asserted Landon.        He didn       t
know Mr. Bruce until we came up here, and that
would have been no motive for his killing Vernie.
Nor can there be any personal motive, Mr. Wise,
for that. Shall we not have to ascribe it to some
form of degeneracy, whether that seems plausible
or not?       
[278]
       No,        decreed Wise, looking sternly from one
to another.        No; John Tracy       s motive for those
two inhuman murders was the motive that is
oftenest the reason for murder       money lust!       
Eve Carnforth gave a scream and buried her
face in her hands.
Milly Landon turned white and swayed as if
about to faint, but her husband caught her in his
arms and supported her.
       What can he mean?        said Norma, turning to
Braye,        how could Mr. Tracy have done it for
money? Who would give him money?       
       Hush, Norma,        said Braye, in a low voice, and
Norma remembered it was the same tone he had
used, when she had before asked questions of him.
She had thought over his words on that occasion,
and had concluded he meant she must not say anything
that seemed to throw suspicion toward Wynne
Landon. She looked at the sobbing Milly, and the
pained, strained face of Wynne, who was trying
to soothe her, and then Norma turned to Eve.
Eve was using all her will power to preserve her
poise, but Norma saw at once that she was having
difficulty to do so. In kindness of heart, Norma
went over to the suffering girl.
       Come with me, Eve,        she said, softly,        let us
go off by ourselves for a while.       
[279]
       Yes, do,        said Penny Wise, looking kindly at
the two girls.        Zizi, perhaps you can be of
use.       
Zizi followed the other two, and they went to
Eve       s room. With all the deftness of a nurse, Zizi
found some aromatic cologne, and a fresh handkerchief,
and in a moment was bathing Eve       s
temples, with a gentle, soothing touch.
       What a funny little piece you are!        said Eve,
looking at the small sympathetic face, and speaking
in a preoccupied way.
       Yes,        acquiesced Zizi, while Norma sat by, lost
in her own thoughts.
       Tell me,        said Eve, suddenly roused to energy.
       Tell me, Zizi,       you know as much as Mr. Wise
does,       tell me, who paid Tracy money?       
       What!        cried Norma,        Eve, hush! don       t say
such things. If anybody did, we don       t want to
know it!       
       We       ll have to know it,        said Eve, simply,        and,
Norma,                     
But Norma interrupted her;        No, Eve, we don       t
have to, at least, we don       t have to ask about it, or
inquire into it. The detective will do that.       
       You       ll soon have to know,        said Zizi, quietly;
       indeed you know now, don       t you, Miss Carnforth?       
       I asked you!        cried Eve, hysterical again.
       Tell me, tell me at once, girl!       
[280]
But Zizi shook her head, and continued to bathe
Eve       s brow.        Try to be calm,        she whispered,
       there will be much for you to bear, and you must
be brave to bear it.       
Eve looked at her wonderingly, and seeing deep
compassion in the black eyes, she ceased questioning
and closed her own eyes.
After a few moments, she opened her eyes and
rose from her couch.        Thank you, Zizi,        she
said,        I am all right now. I am going back to
join the others. Will you come, Norma?       
Dazedly, as one in a dream, Norma rose, and the
three went down stairs. Apparently little had been
said of importance since they left. There was a
tense silence, and Pennington Wise said,        I find I
must speak out and tell you the truth. I had hoped
for a confession but I see no signs of it.
       I was not, strictly speaking, employed by any
one of you. I asked to be allowed to investigate
this case because it seemed to me the most remarkable
one I had ever heard of. I wrote to Professor
Hardwick for information concerning it, and finally
I arranged to come up here. I brought Zizi, because
she is invaluable to me in collecting evidence.
Her quick wit, and her dainty personality can compass
effects that I can not. I feel, therefore, that
it is to Professor Hardwick that I should make my
direct report. But as you are all interested, I will
ask any of you who choose to do so, to remain and
listen. The others may be excused.       
[281]
       Of course, we       ll all stay!        exclaimed Landon.
       We       re all quite as much interested as Professor
Hardwick can possibly be. More so, indeed, for
the victims of the crime are not relatives of his.       
       Very well,        returned Wise,        stay, then, all of
you. The story is not a long one, though it is a
deeply sad one. John Tracy was hired,       basely
hired, to commit those two murders. The man
who hired him is, of course, the greater criminal,
though his hands are unstained with actual blood.
The man who hired the assassin, is, naturally, the
man who desired the large fortune of Gifford Bruce,
and who realized that unless two people were
removed from earth he could not inherit. Need I
say more?       
       You need not,        said Rudolph Braye.        I confess.
The plan was Tracy       s, the suggestion was
his. He tempted me, by telling me that he had
read of a plan by which people could be put to death
and leave no possible trace. He said that I would
eventually inherit the fortune, and that I ought to
have it while I was young enough to enjoy it. He
said he would do the deed and I need know nothing
about it, nor be present at the time. I am not
shifting the blame, I am merely telling you the
facts.       
Braye spoke in a monotone, his eyes on the floor,
his hands nervously twitching.
       A hundred times I regretted our plans, a hundred
times I begged Tracy to give up the project,
but he held me to it, and said if I petered out he
would tell the whole story.
[282]
       When the plan for coming up here was started,
Tracy made me get him invited saying it was an
ideal opportunity. I didn       t think he would really
carry out his intentions, and as the ghost seemed
really to appear, I watched to discover the means.
I did see Stebbins enter through the revolving
column and had no difficulty in discovering how it
worked. I showed this to Tracy,       he made me do
so,       and when I went to New York, he played ghost
and appeared to little Vernie.
       Again and again I plead with him to give up the
fearful scheme but he refused to do so. The day I
went to East Dryden with Milly I had no idea that
he intended to do the deed, but       he did. I had
promised him half the fortune, and he had declared
that there could be no suspicion of either of us,       he
said, if there were any suspicion it would be
directed toward Wynne. I make no excuses, I
voice no cry for forgiveness or for leniency, but I
hereby pay the penalty.       
Braye swallowed what was evidently a portion
of the same poison that had killed Gifford Bruce,
and in less than a minute he was a dead man.
John Tracy was arrested and received his just
deserts.
Wynne Landon inherited the fortune, and though
it had painful associations, he and Milly went away
from Black Aspens never to return and in time lived
down the sad and awful memories.
[283]
       You see, Penny,        Zizi summed up,        a criminal
always slips up on some minor count. If the Tracy
person hadn       t oiled his door and the door of that
haunted room so carefully, or if he       d had the wit
to oil some other doors too, we might have overlooked
him as a possible suspect, eh?       
       I don       t think so, Ziz.       
       Neither do I, Penny Wise.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
