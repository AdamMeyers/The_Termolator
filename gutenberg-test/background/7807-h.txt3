Chapter I
Her Earlier Memories

If old Jeremy Clapp had not sneezed his teeth into
the fire that winter day this story might have had
a more seemly beginning; but, being a true record,
it must start with that sneeze, because it was the
first happening in Georgina Huntingdon&rsquo;s life
which she could remember distinctly.

She was in her high-chair by a window overlooking
a gray sea, and with a bib under her chin, was being
fed dripping spoonfuls of bread and milk from the
silver porringer which rested on the sill. The bowl
was almost on a level with her little blue shoes which
she kept kicking up and down on the step of her high-chair,
wherefore the restraining hand which seized her ankles
at intervals. It was Mrs. Triplett&rsquo;s firm hand
which clutched her, and Mrs. Triplett&rsquo;s firm
hand which fed her, so there was not the usual dilly-dallying
over Georgina&rsquo;s breakfast as when her mother
held the spoon. She always made a game of it, chanting
nursery rhymes in a gay, silver-bell-cockle-shell
sort of way, as if she were one of the &ldquo;pretty
maids all in a row,&rdquo; just stepped out of a picture
book.

Mrs. Triplett was an elderly widow, a distant relative
of the family, who lived with them. &ldquo;Tippy&rdquo;
the child called her before she could speak plainly--a
foolish name for such a severe and dignified person,
but Mrs. Triplett rather seemed to like it. Being
the working housekeeper, companion and everything
else which occasion required, she had no time to make
a game of Georgina&rsquo;s breakfast, even if she had
known how. Not once did she stop to say, &ldquo;Curly-locks,
Curly-locks, wilt thou be mine?&rdquo; or to press
her face suddenly against Georgina&rsquo;s dimpled
rose-leaf cheek as if it were somthing too temptingly
dear and sweet to be resisted. She merely said, &ldquo;Here!&rdquo;
each time she thrust the spoon towards her.

Mrs. Triplett was in an especial hurry this morning,
and did not even look up when old Jeremy came into
the room to put more wood on the fire. In winter,
when there was no garden work, Jeremy did everything
about the house which required a man&rsquo;s hand.
Although he must have been nearly eighty years old,
he came in, tall and unbending, with a big log across
his shoulder. He walked stiffly, but his back was as
straight as the long poker with which he mended the
fire.

Georgina had seen him coming and going about the place
every day since she had been brought to live in this
old gray house beside the sea, but this was the first
time he had made any lasting impression upon her memory.
Henceforth, she was to carry with her as long as she
should live the picture of a hale, red-faced old man
with a woolen muffler wound around his lean throat.
His knitted &ldquo;wrist-warmers&rdquo; slipped down
over his mottled, deeply-veined bands when he stooped
to roll the log into the fire. He let go with a grunt.
The next instant a mighty sneeze seized him, and Georgina,
who had been gazing in fascination at the shower of
sparks he was making, saw all of his teeth go flying
into the fire. If his eyes had suddenly dropped from
their sockets upon the hearth, or his ears floated
off from the sides of his head, she could not have
been more terrified, for she had not yet learned that
one&rsquo;s teeth may be a separate part of one&rsquo;s
anatomy. It was such a terrible thing to see a man
go to pieces in this undreamed-of fashion, that she
began to scream and writhe around in her high-chair
until it nearly turned over.

She did upset the silver porringer, and what was left
of the bread and milk splashed out on the floor, barely
missing the rug. Mrs. Triplett sprang to snatch her
from the toppling chair, thinking the child was having
a spasm. She did not connect it with old Jeremy&rsquo;s
sneeze until she heard his wrathful gibbering, and
turned to see him holding up the teeth, which he had
fished out of the fire with the tongs.

They were an old-fashioned set such as one never sees
now. They had been made in England. They were hinged
together like jaws, and Georgina yelled again as she
saw them all blackened and gaping, dangling from the
tongs. It was not the grinning teeth themselves, however,
which frightened her. It was the awful knowledge,
vague though it was to her infant mind, that a human
body could fly apart in that way. And Tippy, not understanding
the cause of her terror, never thought to explain that
they were false and had been made by a man in some
out-of-the-way corner of Yorkshire, instead of by
the Almighty, and that their removal was painless.

It was several years before Georgina learned the truth,
and the impression made by the accident grew into
a lurking fear which often haunted her as time wore
on. She never knew at what moment she might fly apart
herself. That it was a distressing experience she knew
from the look on old Jeremy&rsquo;s face and the desperate
pace at which he set off to have himself mended.

She held her breath long enough to hear the door bang
shut after him and his hob-nailed shoes go scrunch,
scrunch, through the gravel of the path around the
house, then she broke out crying again so violently
that Tippy had hard work quieting her. She picked
up the silver porringer from the floor and told her
to look at the pretty bowl. The fall had put a dent
into its side. And what would Georgina&rsquo;s great-great
aunt have said could she have known what was going
to happen to her handsome dish, poor lady! Surely
she never would have left it to such a naughty namesake!
Then, to stop her sobbing, Mrs. Triplett took one
tiny finger-tip in her large ones, and traced the
name which was engraved around the rim in tall, slim-looped
letters: the name which had passed down through many
christenings to its present owner, &ldquo;Georgina
Huntingdon.&rdquo;

Failing thus to pacify the frightened child, Mrs.
Triplett held her up to the window overlooking the
harbor, and dramatically bade her &ldquo;hark!&rdquo;
Standing with her blue shoes on the window-sill, and
a tear on each pink cheek, Georgina flattened her
nose against the glass and obediently listened.

The main street of the ancient seaport town, upon
which she gazed expectantly, curved three miles around
the harbor, and the narrow board-walk which ran along
one side of it all the way, ended abruptly just in
front of the house in a waste of sand. So there was
nothing to be seen but a fishing boat at anchor, and
the waves crawling up the beach, and nothing to be
heard but the jangle of a bell somewhere down the street.
The sobs broke out again. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; commanded
Mrs. Triplett, giving her an impatient shake. &ldquo;Hark
to what&rsquo;s coming up along. Can&rsquo;t you stop
a minute and give the Towncrier a chance? Or is it
you&rsquo;re trying to outdo him?&rdquo;

The word &ldquo;Towncrier&rdquo; was meaningless to
Georgina. There was nothing by that name in her linen
book which held the pictures of all the animals from
Ape to Zebra, and there was nothing by that name down
in Kentucky where she had lived all of her short life
until these last few weeks. She did not even know
whether what Mrs. Triplett said was coming along would
be wearing a hat or horns. The cow that lowed at the
pasture bars every night back in Kentucky jangled
a bell. Georgina had no distinct recollection of the
cow, but because of it the sound of a bell was associated
in her mind with horns. So horns were what she halfway
expected to see, as she watched breathlessly, with
her face against the glass.

&ldquo;Hark to what he&rsquo;s calling!&rdquo; urged
Mrs. Triplett. &ldquo;A fish auction. There&rsquo;s
a big boat in this morning with a load of fish, and
the Towncrier is telling everybody about it.&rdquo;

So a Towncrier was a man! The next instant Georgina
saw him. He was an old man, with bent shoulders and
a fringe of gray hair showing under the fur cap pulled
down to meet his ears. But there was such a happy twinkle
in his faded blue eyes, such goodness of heart in every
wrinkle of the weather-beaten old face, that even
the grumpiest people smiled a little when they met
him, and everybody he spoke to stepped along a bit
more cheerful, just because the hearty way he said
&ldquo;_Good_ morning!&rdquo; made the day
seem really good.

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; said Tippy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
tap on the window and beckon him to come in and warm
himself before he starts back to town.&rdquo;

She caught up Georgina&rsquo;s hand to make it do
the tapping, thinking it would please her to give
her a share in the invitation, but in her touchy frame
of mind it was only an added grievance to have her
knuckles knocked against the pane, and her wails began
afresh as the old man, answering the signal, shook
his bell at her playfully, and turned towards the
house.

As to what happened after that, Georgina&rsquo;s memory
is a blank, save for a confused recollection of being
galloped to Banbury Cross on somebody&rsquo;s knee,
while a big hand helped her to clang the clapper of
a bell far too heavy for her to swing alone. But some
dim picture of the kindly face puckered into smiles
for her comforting, stayed on in her mind as an object
seen through a fog, and thereafter she never saw the
Towncrier go kling-klanging along the street without
feeling a return of that same sense of safety which
his song gave her that morning. Somehow, it restored
her confidence in all Creation which Jeremy&rsquo;s
teeth had shattered in their fall.

Taking advantage of Georgina&rsquo;s contentment at
being settled on the visitor&rsquo;s knee, Mrs. Triplett
hurried for a cloth to wipe up the bread and milk.
Kneeling on the floor beside it she sopped it up so
energetically that what she was saying came in jerks.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mercy you happened along, Mr.
Darcy, or she might have been screaming yet. I never
saw a child go into such a sudden tantrum.&rdquo;

The answer came in jerks also, for it took a vigorous
trotting of the knees to keep such a heavy child as
Georgina on the bounce. And in order that his words
might not interfere with the game he sang them to the
tune of &ldquo;Ride a Cock Horse.&rdquo;

&ldquo;There must have been--some--very good----
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reason for such--a hulla-ba-loo!&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when I come back,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Triplett, on her feet again by this time
and halfway to the kitchen with the dripping floor
cloth. But when she reappeared in the doorway her
own concerns had crowded out the thought of old Jeremy&rsquo;s
misfortune.

&ldquo;My yeast is running all over the top of the
crock, Mr. Darcy, and if I don&rsquo;t get it mixed
right away the whole baking will be spoiled.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;Go ahead with your dough. I&rsquo;ll
keep the little lass out of mischief. Many&rsquo;s
the time I have sat by this fire with her father on
my knee, as you know. But it&rsquo;s been years since
I was in this room last.&rdquo;

There was a long pause in the Banbury Cross ride.
The Crier was looking around the room from one familiar
object to another with the gentle wistfulness which
creeps into old eyes when they peer into the past for
something that has ceased to be. Georgina grew impatient.

&ldquo;More ride!&rdquo; she commanded, waving her
hands and clucking her tongue as he had just taught
her to do.

&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her worry you, Mr. Darcy,&rdquo;
called Mrs. Triplett from the kitchen. &ldquo;Her
mother will be back from the post-office most any minute
now. Just send her out here to me if she gets too bothersome.&rdquo;

Instantly Georgina cuddled her head down against his
shoulder. She had no mind to be separated from this
new-found playfellow. When he produced a battered
silver watch from the pocket of his velveteen waistcoat,
holding it over her ear, she was charmed into a prolonged
silence. The clack of Tippy&rsquo;s spoon against
the crock came in from the kitchen, and now and then
the fire snapped or the green fore-log made a sing-song
hissing.

More than thirty years had passed by since the old
Towncrier first visited the Huntingdon home. He was
not the Towncrier then, but a seafaring man who had
sailed many times around the globe, and had his fill
of adventure. Tired at last of such a roving life,
he had found anchorage to his liking in this quaint
old fishing town at the tip end of Cape Cod. Georgina&rsquo;s
grandfather, George Justin Huntingdon, a judge and
a writer of dry law books, had been one of the first
to open his home to him. They had been great friends,
and little Justin, now Georgina&rsquo;s father, had
been a still closer friend. Many a day they had spent
together, these two, fishing or blueberrying or tramping
across the dunes. The boy called him &ldquo;Uncle
Darcy,&rdquo; tagging after him like a shadow, and
feeling a kinship in their mutual love of adventure
which drew as strongly as family ties. The Judge always
said that it was the old sailor&rsquo;s yarns of sea
life which sent Justin into the navy &ldquo;instead
of the law office where he belonged.&rdquo;

As the old man looked down at Georgina&rsquo;s soft,
brown curls pressed against his shoulder, and felt
her little dimpled hand lying warm on his neck, he
could almost believe it was the same child who had
crept into his heart thirty years ago. It was hard
to think of the little lad as grown, or as filling
the responsible position of a naval surgeon. Yet when
he counted back he realized that the Judge had been
dead several years, and the house had been standing
empty all that time. Justin had never been back since
it was boarded up. He had written occasionally during
the first of his absence, but only boyish scrawls which
told little about himself.

The only real news which the old man had of him was
in the three clippings from the Provincetown _Beacon_,
which he carried about in his wallet. The first was
a mention of Justin&rsquo;s excellent record in fighting
a fever epidemic in some naval station in the tropics.
The next was the notice of his marriage to a Kentucky
girl by the name of Barbara Shirley, and the last
was a paragraph clipped from a newspaper dated only
a few weeks back. It said that Mrs. Justin Huntingdon
and little daughter, Georgina, would arrive soon to
take possession of the old Huntingdon homestead which
had been closed for many years. During the absence
of her husband, serving in foreign parts, she would
have with her Mrs. Maria Triplett.

The Towncrier had known Mrs. Triplett as long as he
had known the town. She had been kind to him when
he and his wife were in great trouble. He was thinking
about that time now, because it had something to do
with his last visit to the Judge in this very room.
She had happened to be present, too. And the green
fore-log had made that same sing-song hissing. The
sound carried his thoughts back so far that for a few
moments he ceased to hear the clack of the spoon.



Chapter II
Georgina&rsquo;s Playmate Mother

As the Towncrier&rsquo;s revery brought him around
to Mrs. Triplett&rsquo;s part in the painful scene
which he was recalling, he heard her voice, and looking
up, saw that she had come back into the room, and was
standing by the window.

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Justin&rsquo;s wife now, Mr.
Darcy, coming up the beach. Poor child, she didn&rsquo;t
get her letter. I can tell she&rsquo;s disappointed
from the way she walks along as if she could hardly
push against the wind.&rdquo;

The old man, leaning sideways over the arm of his
chair, craned his neck toward the window to peer out,
but he did it without dislodging Georgina, who was
repeating the &ldquo;tick-tick&rdquo; of the watch
in a whisper, as she lay contentedly against the Towncrier&rsquo;s
shoulder.

&ldquo;She&rsquo;s naught but a slip of a girl,&rdquo;
he commented, referring to Georgina&rsquo;s mother,
slowly drawing into closer view. &ldquo;She must be
years younger than Justin. She came up to me in the
post-office last week and told me who she was, and
I&rsquo;ve been intending ever since to get up this
far to talk with her about him.&rdquo;

As they watched her she reached the end of the board-walk,
and plunging ankle-deep into the sand, trudged slowly
along as if pushed back by the wind. It whipped her
skirts about her and blew the ends of her fringed
scarf back over her shoulder. She made a bright flash
of color against the desolate background. Scarf, cap
and thick knitted reefer were all of a warm rose shade.
Once she stopped, and with hands thrust into her reefer
pockets, stood looking off towards the lighthouse on
Long Point. Mrs. Triplett spoke again, still watching
her.

&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to take Justin&rsquo;s
offer when he first wrote to me, although the salary
he named was a good one, and I knew the work wouldn&rsquo;t
be more than I&rsquo;ve always been used to. But I
had planned to stay in Wellfleet this winter, and
it always goes against the grain with me to have to
change a plan once made. I only promised to stay until
she was comfortably settled. A Portugese woman on
one of the back streets would have come and cooked
for her. But land! When I saw how strange and lonesome
she seemed and how she turned to me for everything,
I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to say go. I only named
it once to her, and she sort of choked up and winked
back the tears and said in that soft-spoken Southern
way of hers, &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t leave me, Tippy!&rsquo;
She&rsquo;s taken to calling me Tippy, just as Georgina
does. &rsquo;When you talk about it I feel like a
kitten shipwrecked on a desert island. It&rsquo;s all
so strange and dreadful here with just sea on one
side and sand dunes on the other.&rsquo;&rdquo;

At the sound of her name, Georgina suddenly sat up
straight and began fumbling the watch back into the
velveteen pocket. She felt that it was time for her
to come into the foreground again.

&ldquo;More ride!&rdquo; she demanded. The galloping
began again, gently at first, then faster and faster
in obedience to her wishes, until she seemed only
a swirl of white dress and blue ribbon and flying brown
curls. But this time the giddy going up and down was
in tame silence. There was no accompanying song to
make the game lively. Mrs. Triplett had more to say,
and Mr. Darcy was too deeply interested to sing.

&ldquo;Look at her now, stopping to read that sign
set up on the spot where the Pilgrims landed. She
does that every time she passes it. Says it cheers
her up something wonderful, no matter how downhearted
she is, to think that she wasn&rsquo;t one of the
Mayflower passengers, and that she&rsquo;s nearly
three hundred years away from their hardships and that
dreadful first wash-day of theirs. Does seem to me
though, that&rsquo;s a poor way to make yourself cheerful,
just thinking of all the hard times you might have
had but didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

&ldquo;_Thing_ it!&rdquo; lisped Georgina,
wanting undivided attention, and laying an imperious
little hand on his cheek to force it. &ldquo;_Thing_!&rdquo;

He shook his head reprovingly, with a finger across
his lips to remind her that Mrs. Triplett was still
talking; but she was not to be silenced in such a
way. Leaning over until her mischievous brown eyes
compelled him to look at her, she smiled like a dimpled
cherub. Georgina&rsquo;s smile was something irresistible
when she wanted her own way.

&ldquo;_Pleathe!_&rdquo; she lisped, her
face so radiantly sure that no one could be hardhearted
enough to resist the magic appeal of that word, that
he could not disappoint her.

&ldquo;The little witch!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;She
could wheedle the fish out of the sea if she&rsquo;d
say please to &rsquo;em that way. But how that honey-sweet
tone and the yells she was letting loose awhile back
could come out of that same little rose of a mouth,
passes my understanding.&rdquo;

Mrs. Triplett had left them again and he was singing
at the top of his quavering voice, &ldquo;Rings on
her fingers and bells on her toes,&rdquo; when the
front door opened and Georgina&rsquo;s mother came
in. The salt wind had blown color into her cheeks
as bright as her rose-pink reefer. Her disappointment
about the letter had left a wistful shadow in her big
gray eyes, but it changed to a light of pleasure when
she saw who was romping with Georgina. They were so
busy with their game that neither of them noticed
her entrance.

She closed the door softly behind her and stood with
her back against it watching them a moment. Then Georgina
spied her, and with a rapturous cry of &ldquo;_Barby!_&rdquo;
scrambled down and ran to throw herself into her mother&rsquo;s
arms. Barby was her way of saying Barbara. It was the
first word she had ever spoken and her proud young
mother encouraged her to repeat it, even when her
Grandmother Shirley insisted that it wasn&rsquo;t respectful
for a child to call its mother by her first name.

&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t care whether it is or not,&rdquo;
Barbara had answered. &ldquo;All I want is for her
to feel that we&rsquo;re the best chums in the world.
And I&rsquo;m _not_ going to spoil her even
if I am young and inexperienced. There are a few things
that I expect to be very strict about, but making her
respectful to me isn&rsquo;t one of them.&rdquo;

Now one of the things which Barbara had decided to
be very strict about in Georgina&rsquo;s training
was making her respectful to guests. She was not to
thrust herself upon their notice, she was not to interrupt
their conversation, or make a nuisance of herself.
So, young as she was, Georgina had already learned
what was expected of her, when her mother having greeted
Mr. Darcy and laid aside her wraps, drew up to the
fire to talk to him. But instead of doing the expected
thing, Georgina did the forbidden. Since the old man&rsquo;s
knees were crossed so that she could no longer climb
upon them, she attempted to seat herself on his foot,
clamoring, &ldquo;Do it again!&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; Barbara said firmly. &ldquo;Uncle
Darcy&rsquo;s tired.&rdquo; She had noticed the long-drawn
sigh of relief with which he ended the last gallop.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to tell us about father when
he was a little boy no bigger than you. So come here
to Barby and listen or else go off to your own corner
and play with your whirligig.&rdquo;

Usually, at the mention of some particularly pleasing
toy Georgina would trot off happily to find it; but
to-day she stood with her face drawn into a rebellious
pucker and scowled at her mother savagely. Then throwing
herself down on the rug she began kicking her blue
shoes up and down on the hearth, roaring, _"No!
No!"_ at the top of her voice. Barbara paid
no attention at first, but finding it impossible to
talk with such a noise going on, dragged her up from
the floor and looked around helplessly, considering
what to do with her. Then she remembered the huge
wicker clothes hamper, standing empty in the kitchen,
and carrying her out, gently lowered her into it.

It was so deep that even on tiptoe Georgina could
not look over the rim. All she could see was the ceiling
directly overhead. The surprise of such a novel punishment
made her hold her breath to find what was going to
happen next, and in the stillness she heard her mother
say calmly as she walked out of the room: &ldquo;If
she roars any more, Tippy, just put the lid on; but
as soon as she is ready to act like a little lady,
lift her out, please.&rdquo;

The strangeness of her surroundings kept her quiet
a moment longer, and in that moment she discovered
that by putting one eye to a loosely-woven spot in
the hamper she could see what Mrs. Triplett was doing.
She was polishing the silver porringer, trying to
rub out the dent which the fall had made in its side.
It was such an interesting kitchen, seen through this
peep-hole that Georgina became absorbed in rolling
her eye around for wider views. Then she found another
outlook on the other side of the hamper, and was quiet
so long that Mrs. Triplett came over and peered down
at her to see what was the matter. Georgina looked
up at her with a roguish smile. One never knew how
she was going to take a punishment or what she would
do next.

&ldquo;Are you ready to be a little lady now? Want
me to lift you out?&rdquo; Both little arms were stretched
joyously up to her, and a voice of angelic sweetness
said coaxingly: &ldquo;_Pleathe_, Tippy.&rdquo;

The porringer was in Mrs. Triplett&rsquo;s hand when
she leaned over the hamper to ask the question. The
gleam of its freshly-polished sides caught Georgina&rsquo;s
attention an instant before she was lifted out, and
it was impressed on her memory still more deeply by
being put into her own hands afterwards as she sat
in Mrs. Triplett&rsquo;s lap. Once more her tiny finger&rsquo;s
tip was made to trace the letters engraved around the
rim, as she was told about her great-great aunt and
what was expected of her. The solemn tone clutched
her attention as firmly as the hand which held her,
and somehow, before she was set free, she was made
to feel that because of that old porringer she was
obliged to be a little lady.

Tippy was not one who could sit calmly by and see
a child suffer for lack of proper instruction, and
while Georgina never knew just how it was done, the
fact was impressed upon her as years went by that there
were many things which she could not do, simply because
she was a Huntingdon and because her name had been
graven for so many generations around that shining
silver rim.

Although to older eyes the happenings of that morning
were trivial, they were far-reaching in their importance
to Georgina, for they gave her three memories--Jeremy&rsquo;s
teeth, the Towncrier&rsquo;s bell, and her own name
on the porringer--to make a deep impression on all
her after-life.



Chapter III
The Towncrier Has His Say

The old Huntingdon house with its gray gables and
stone chimneys, stood on the beach near the breakwater,
just beyond the place where everything seemed to come
to an end. The house itself marked the end of the town.
Back of it the dreary dunes stretched away toward the
Atlantic, and in front the Cape ran out in a long,
thin tongue of sand between the bay and the harbor,
with a lighthouse on its farthest point. It gave one
the feeling of being at the very tip end of the world
to look across and see the water closing in on both
sides. Even the road ended in front of the house in
a broad loop in which machines could turn around.

In summer there was always a string of sightseers
coming up to this end of the beach. They came to read
the tablet erected on the spot known to Georgina as
&ldquo;holy ground,&rdquo; because it marked the first
landing of the Pilgrims. Long before she could read,
Mrs. Triplett taught her to lisp part of a poem which
said:

&ldquo;Aye, call it holy ground,
The thoil where firth they trod.&rdquo;

She taught it to Georgina because she thought it was
only fair to Justin that his child should grow up
to be as proud of her New England home as she was
of her Southern one. Barbara was always singing to
her about &ldquo;My Old Kentucky Home,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Going Back to Dixie,&rdquo; and when they played
together on the beach their favorite game was building
Grandfather Shirley&rsquo;s house in the sand.

Day after day they built it up with shells and wet
sand and pebbles, even to the stately gate posts topped
by lanterns. Twigs of bayberry and wild beach plum
made trees with which to border its avenues, and every
dear delight of swing and arbor and garden pool beloved
in Barbara&rsquo;s play-days, was reproduced in miniature
until Georgina loved them, too. She knew just where
the bee-hives ought to be put, and the sun-dial, and
the hole in the fence where the little pigs squeezed
through. There was a story for everything. By the
time she had outgrown her lisp she could make the
whole fair structure by herself, without even a suggestion
from Barbara.

When she grew older the shore was her schoolroom also.
She learned to read from letters traced in the sand,
and to make them herself with shells and pebbles.
She did her sums that, way, too, after she had learned
to count the sails in the harbor, the gulls feeding
at ebb-tide, and the great granite blocks which formed
the break-water.

Mrs. Triplett&rsquo;s time for lessons was when Georgina
was following her about the house. Such following
taught her to move briskly, for Tippy, like time and
tide, never waited, and it behooved one to be close
at her heels if one would see what she put into a
pan before she whisked it into the oven. Also it was
necessary to keep up with her as she moved swiftly
from the cellar to the pantry if one would hear her
thrilling tales of Indians and early settlers and
brave forefathers of colony times.

There was a powder horn hanging over the dining room
mantel, which had been in the battle of Lexington,
and Tippy expected Georgina to find the same inspiration
in it which she did, because the forefather who carried
it was an ancestor of each.

&ldquo;The idea of a descendant of one of the Minutemen
being afraid of _rats!_&rdquo; she would
say with a scornful rolling of her words which seemed
to wither her listener with ridicule. &ldquo;Or of
an empty garret! _Tut!_&rdquo;

When Georgina was no more than six, that disgusted
&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; would start her instantly down
a dark cellar-way or up into the dreaded garret, even
when she could feel the goose-flesh rising all over
her. Between the porringer, which obliged her to be
a little lady, and the powder horn, which obliged
her to be brave, even while she shivered, some times
Georgina felt that she had almost too much to live
up to. There were times when she was sorry that she
had ancestors. She was proud to think that one of
them shared in the honors of the tall Pilgrim monument
overlooking the town and harbor, but there were days
when she would have traded him gladly far an hour&rsquo;s
play with two little Portugese boys and their sister,
who often wandered up to the dunes back of the house.

She had watched them often enough to know that their
names were Manuel and Joseph and Rosa. They were beautiful
children, such as some of the old masters delighted
to paint, but they fought and quarreled and--Tippy
said--used &ldquo;shocking language.&rdquo; That is
why Georgina was not allowed to play with them, but
she often stood at the back gate watching them, envying
their good times together and hoping to hear a sample
of their shocking language.

One day when they strolled by dragging a young puppy
in a rusty saucepan by a string tied to the handle,
the temptation to join them overcame her. Inch by
inch her hand moved up nearer the forbidden gate latch
and she was just slipping through when old Jeremy,
hidden behind a hedge where he was weeding the borders,
rose up like an all-seeing dragon and roared at her,
&ldquo;Coom away, lass! Ye maun&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;

She had not known that he was anywhere around, and
the voice coming suddenly out of the unseen startled
her so that her heart seemed to jump up into her throat.
It made her angry, too. Only the moment before she
had heard Rosa scream at Manuel, &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t
my boss; shut your big mouth!&rdquo;

It was on the tip of her tongue to scream the same
thing at old Jeremy and see what would happen. She
felt, instinctively, that this was shocking language.
But she had not yet outgrown the lurking fear which
always seized her in his presence that either her teeth
or his might fly out if she wasn&rsquo;t careful,
so she made no answer. But compelled to vent her inward
rebellion in some way, she turned her back on the hedge
that screened him and shook the gate till the latch
rattled.

Looking up she saw the tall Pilgrim monument towering
over the town like a watchful giant. She had a feeling
that it, too, was spying on her. No matter where she
went, even away out in the harbor in a motor boat,
it was always stretching its long neck up to watch
her. Shaking back her curls, she looked up at it defiantly
and made a face at it, just the ugliest pucker of
a face she could twist her little features into.

But it was only on rare occasions that Georgina felt
the longing for playmates of her own age. Usually
she was busy with her lessons or happily following
her mother and Mrs. Triplett around the house, sharing
all their occupations. In jelly-making time she had
the scrapings of the kettle to fill her own little
glass. When they sewed she sewed with them, even when
she was so small that she had to have the thread tied
in the needle&rsquo;s eye, and could do no more than
pucker up a piece of soft goods into big wallops.
But by the time she was nine years old she had learned
to make such neat stitches that Barbara sent specimens
of her needlework back to Kentucky, and folded others
away in a little trunk of keepsakes, to save for her
until she should be grown.

Abo by the time she was nine she could play quite
creditably a number of simple Etudes on the tinkly
old piano which had lost some of its ivories. Her
daily practicing was one of the few things about which
Barbara was strict. So much attention had been given
to her own education in music that she found joy in
keeping up her interest in it, and wanted to make
it one of Georgina&rsquo;s chief sources of pleasure.
To that end she mixed the stories of the great operas
and composers with her fairy tales and folk lore,
until the child knew them as intimately as she did
her Hans Andersen and Uncle Remus.

They often acted stories together, too. Even Mrs.
Triplett was dragged into these, albeit unwillingly,
for minor but necessary parts. For instance, in &ldquo;Lord
Ullin&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; she could keep on with
her knitting and at the same time do &ldquo;the horsemen
hard behind us ride,&rdquo; by clapping her heels
on the hearth to sound like hoof-beats.

Acting came as naturally to Georgina as breathing.
She could not repeat the simplest message without
unconsciously imitating the tone and gesture of the
one who sent it. This dramatic instinct made a good
reader of her when she took her turn with Barbara
in reading aloud. They used to take page about, sitting
with their arms around each other on the old claw-foot
sofa, backed up against the library table.

At such performances the old Towncrier was often an
interested spectator. Barbara welcomed him when he
first came because he seemed to want to talk about
Justin as much as she desired to hear. Later she welcomed
him for his own sake, and grew to depend upon him
for counsel and encouragement. Most of all she appreciated
his affectionate interest in Georgina. If he had been
her own grandfather he could not have taken greater
pride in her little accomplishments. More than once
he had tied her thread in her needle for her when
she was learning to sew, and it was his unfailing
praise of her awkward attempts which encouraged her
to I keep on until her stitches were really praiseworthy.

He applauded her piano playing from her first stumbling
attempt at scales to the last simple waltz she had
just learned. He attended many readings, beginning
with words of one syllable, on up to such books as
&ldquo;The Leatherstocking Tales.&rdquo; He came in
one day, however, as they were finishing a chapter
in one of the Judge&rsquo;s favorite novels, and no
sooner had Georgina skipped out of the room on an
errand than he began to take her mother to task for
allowing her to read anything of that sort.

&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make the lass old before her time!&rdquo;
he scolded. &ldquo;A little scrap like her ought to
be playing with other children instead of reading books
so far over her head that she can only sort of tip-toe
up to them.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the stretching that makes her
grow, Uncle Darcy,&rdquo; Barbara answered in an indulgent
tone. He went on heedless of her interruption.

&ldquo;And she tells me that she sometimes sits as
much as an hour at a time, listening to you play on
the piano, especially if it&rsquo;s &rsquo;sad music
that makes you think of someone looking off to sea
for a ship that never comes in, or of waves creeping
up in a lonely place where the fog-bell tolls.&rsquo;
Those were her very words, and she looked so mournful
that it worried me. It isn&rsquo;t natural for a child
of her age to sit with a far-away look in her eyes,
as if she were seeing things that ain&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;

Barbara laughed.

&ldquo;Nonsense, Uncle Darcy. As long as she keeps
her rosy cheeks and is full of life, a little dreaming
can&rsquo;t hurt her. You should have seen her doing
the elfin dance this morning. She entered into the
spirit of it like a little whirlwind. And, besides,
there are no children anywhere near that I can allow
her to play with. I have only a few acquaintances in
the town, and they are too far from us to make visiting
easy between the children. But look at the time _I_
give to her. I play with her so much that we&rsquo;re
more like two chums than mother and child.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes, but it would be better for both of you
if you had more friends outside. Then Georgina wouldn&rsquo;t
feel the sadness of &rsquo;someone looking off to
sea for a ship that never comes in.&rsquo; She feels
your separation from Justin and your watching for
his letters and your making your whole life just a
waiting time between his furloughs, more than you have
any idea of.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But, Uncle Darcy!&rdquo; exclaimed Barbara,
&ldquo;it would be just the same no matter how many
friends I had. They couldn&rsquo;t make me forget his
absence.&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, but they could get you interested in other
things, and Georgina would feel the difference, and
be happier because you would not seem to be waiting
and anxious. There&rsquo;s some rare, good people in
this town, old friends of the family who tried to
make you feel at home among them when you first came.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; admitted Barbara, slowly, &ldquo;but
I was so young then, and so homesick that strangers
didn&rsquo;t interest me. Now Georgina is old enough
to be thoroughly companionable, and our music and
sewing and household duties fill our days.&rdquo;

It was a subject they had discussed before, without
either convincing the other, and the old man had always
gone away at such times with a feeling of defeat.
But this time as he took his leave, it was with the
determination to take the matter in hand himself. He
felt he owed it to the Judge to do that much for his
grandchild. The usual crowds of summer people would
be coming soon. He had heard that Gray Inn was to be
re-opened this summer. That meant there would probably
be children at this end of the beach. If Opportunity
came that near to Georgina&rsquo;s door he knew several
ways of inducing it to knock. So he went off smiling
to himself.



Chapter IV
New Friends and the Green Stairs

The town filled up with artists earlier than usual
that summer. Stable lofts and old boathouses along
the shore blossomed into studios. Sketching classes
met in the rooms of the big summer art schools which
made the Cape end famous, or set up their models down
by the wharfs. One ran into easels pitched in the
most public places: on busy street corners, on the
steps of the souvenir shops and even in front of the
town hall. People in paint-besmeared smocks, loaded
with canvases, sketching stools and palettes, filled
the board-walk and overflowed into the middle of the
street.

The _Dorothy Bradford_ steamed up to the
wharf from Boston with her daily load of excursionists,
and the &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; busses began to
ply up and down the three miles of narrow street with
its restless tide of summer visitors.

Up along, through the thick of it one June morning,
came the Towncrier, a picturesque figure in his short
blue jacket and wide seaman&rsquo;s trousers, a red
bandanna knotted around his throat and a wide-rimmed
straw hat on the back of his head.

&ldquo;Notice!&rdquo; he cried, after each vigorous
ringing of his big brass bell. &ldquo;Lost, between
Mayflower Heights and the Gray Inn, a black leather
bill-case with important papers.&rdquo;

He made slow progress, for someone stopped him at
almost every rod with a word of greeting, and he stopped
to pat every dog which thrust a friendly nose into
his hand in passing. Several times strangers stepped
up to him to inquire into his affairs as if he were
some ancient historical personage come to life. Once
he heard a man say:

&ldquo;Quick with your kodak, Ethel. Catch the Towncrier
as he comes along. They say there&rsquo;s only one
other place in the whole United States that has one.
You can&rsquo;t afford to miss anything _this_
quaint.&rdquo;

It was nearly noon when he came towards the end of
the beach. He walked still more slowly here, for many
cottages had been opened for summer residents since
the last time he passed along, and he knew some of
the owners. He noticed that the loft above a boat-house
which had once been the studio of a famous painter
of marine scenes was again in use. He wondered who
had taken it. Almost across from it was the &ldquo;Green
Stairs&rdquo; where Georgina always came to meet him
if she were outdoors and heard his bell.

The &ldquo;Green Stairs&rdquo; was the name she had
given to a long flight of wooden steps with a railing
on each side, leading from the sidewalk up a steep
embankment to the bungalow on top. It was a wide-spreading
bungalow with as many windows looking out to sea as
a lighthouse, and had had an especial interest for
Georgina, since she heard someone say that its owner,
Mr. Milford, was an old bachelor who lived by himself.
She used to wonder when she was younger if &ldquo;all
the bread and cheese he got he kept upon a shelf.&rdquo;
Once she asked Barbara why he didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;go
to London to get him a wife,&rdquo; and was told probably
because he had so many guests that there wasn&rsquo;t
time. Interesting people were always coming and going
about the house; men famous for things they had done
or written or painted.

Now as the Towncrier came nearer, he saw Georgina
skipping along toward him with her jumping rope. She
was bare-headed, her pink dress fluttering in the
salt breeze, her curls blowing back from her glowing
little face. He would have hastened his steps to meet
her, but his honest soul always demanded a certain
amount of service from himself for the dollar paid
him for each trip of this kind. So he went on at his
customary gait, stopping at the usual intervals to
ring his bell and call his news.

At the Green Stairs Georgina paused, her attention
attracted by a foreign-looking battleship just steaming
into the harbor. She was familiar with nearly every
kind of sea-going craft that ever anchored here, but
she could not classify this one. With her hands behind
her, clasping her jumping rope ready for another throw,
she stood looking out to sea. Presently a slight scratching
sound behind her made her turn suddenly. Then she
drew back startled, for she was face to face with a
dog which was sitting on the step just on a level with
her eyes. He was a ragged-looking tramp of a dog,
an Irish terrier, but he looked at her in such a knowing,
human way that she spoke to him as if he had been a
person.

&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, how you made me jump!
I didn&rsquo;t know anybody was sitting there behind
me.&rdquo; It was almost uncanny the way his eyes twinkled
through his hair, as if he were laughing with her over
some good joke they had together. It gave her such
a feeling of comradeship that she stood and smiled
back at him. Suddenly he raised his right paw and thrust
it towards her. She drew back another step. She was
not used to dogs, and she hesitated about touching
anything with such claws in it as the paw he gravely
presented.

But as he continued to hold it out she felt it would
be impolite not to respond in some way, so reaching
out very cautiously she gave it a limp shake. Then
as he still kept looking at her with questioning eyes
she asked quite as if she expected him to speak, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
your name, Dog?&rdquo;

A voice from the top of the steps answered, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Captain Kidd.&rdquo; Even more startled than when
the dog had claimed her attention, she glanced up
to see a small boy on the highest step. He was sucking
an orange, but he took his mouth away from it long
enough to add, &ldquo;His name&rsquo;s on his collar
that he got yesterday, and so&rsquo;s mine. You can
look at &rsquo;em if you want to.&rdquo;

Georgina leaned forward to peer at the engraving on
the front of the collar, but the hair on the shaggy
throat hid it, and she was timid about touching a
spot just below such a wide open mouth with a red tongue
lolling out of it. She put her hands behind her instead.

&ldquo;Is--is he--a pirate dog?&rdquo; she ventured.

The boy considered a minute, not wanting to say yes
if pirates were not respectable in her eyes, and not
wanting to lose the chance of glorifying him if she
held them in as high esteem as he did. After a long
meditative suck at his orange he announced, &ldquo;Well,
he&rsquo;s just as good as one. He buries all his
treasures. That&rsquo;s why we call him Captain Kidd.&rdquo;

Georgina shot a long, appraising glance at the boy
from under her dark lashes. His eyes were dark, too.
There was something about him that attracted her,
even if his face was smeary with orange juice and streaked
with dirty finger marks. She wanted to ask more about
Captain Kidd, but her acquaintance with boys was as
slight as with dogs. Overcome by a sudden shyness
she threw her rope over her head and went skipping
on down the boardwalk to meet the Towncrier.

The boy stood up and looked after her. He wished she
hadn&rsquo;t been in such a hurry. It had been the
longest morning he ever lived through. Having arrived
only the day before with his father to visit at the
bungalow he hadn&rsquo;t yet discovered what there
was for a boy to do in this strange place. Everybody
had gone off and left him with the servants, and told
him to play around till they got back. It wouldn&rsquo;t
be long, they said, but he had waited and waited until
he felt he had been looking out to sea from the top
of those green steps all the days of his life. Of course,
he wouldn&rsquo;t want to play with just a girl, but----

He watched the pink dress go fluttering on, and then
he saw Georgina take the bell away from the old man
as if it were her right to do so. She turned and walked
along beside him, tinkling it faintly as she talked.
He wished he had a chance at it. He&rsquo;d show her
how loud he could make it sound.

&ldquo;Notice,&rdquo; called the old man, seeing faces
appear at some of the windows they were passing. &ldquo;Lost,
a black leather bill-case----&rdquo;

The boy, listening curiously, slid down the steps
until he reached the one on which the dog was sitting,
and put his arm around its neck. The banister posts
hid him from the approaching couple. He could hear
Georgina&rsquo;s eager voice piping up flute-like:

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pirate dog, Uncle Darcy. He&rsquo;s
named Captain Kidd because he buries his treasures.&rdquo;

In answer the old man&rsquo;s quavering voice rose
in a song which he had roared lustily many a time
in his younger days, aboard many a gallant vessel:

&ldquo;Oh, my name is Captain Kidd,
And many wick-ud things I did,
And heaps of gold I hid,
As I sailed.&rdquo;

The way his voice slid down on the word wick-_ud_
made a queer thrilly feeling run down the boy&rsquo;s
back, and all of a sudden the day grew wonderfully
interesting, and this old seaport town one of the nicest
places he had ever been in. The singer stopped at the
steps and Georgina, disconcerted at finding the boy
at such close range when she expected to see him far
above her, got no further in her introduction to Captain
Kidd than &ldquo;Here he------&rdquo;

But the old man needed no introduction. He had only
to speak to the dog to set every inch of him quivering
in affectionate response. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a friend
worth having,&rdquo; the raggedy tail seemed to signal
in a wig-wag code of its own.

Then the wrinkled hand went from the dog&rsquo;s head
to the boy&rsquo;s shoulder with the same kind of
an affectionate pat. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s _your_
name, son?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Richard Morland.&rdquo;

&ldquo;What?&rdquo; was the surprised question. &ldquo;Are
you a son of the artist Morland, who is visiting up
here at the Milford bungalow?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s us.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, bless my stars, it&rsquo;s _his_
bill-case I have been crying all morning. If I&rsquo;d
known there was a fine lad like you sitting about doing
nothing, I&rsquo;d had you with me, ringing the bell.&rdquo;

The little fellow&rsquo;s face glowed. He was as quick
to recognize a friend worth having as Captain Kidd
had been.

&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;if it was Daddy&rsquo;s
bill-case you were shouting about, you needn&rsquo;t
do it any longer. It&rsquo;s found. Captain Kidd came
in with it in his mouth just after Daddy went away.
He was starting to dig a hole in the sand down by
the garage to bury it in, like he does everything.
He&rsquo;s hardly done being a puppy yet, you know.
I took it away from him and reckanized it, and I&rsquo;ve
been waiting here all morning for Dad to come home.&rdquo;

He began tugging at the pocket into which he had stowed
the bill-case for safe-keeping, and Captain Kidd,
feeling that it was his by right of discovery, stood
up, wagging himself all over, and poking his nose in
between them, with an air of excited interest. The
Towncrier shook his finger at him.

&ldquo;You rascal! I suppose you&rsquo;ll be claiming
the reward next thing, you old pirate! How old is
he, Richard?&rdquo;

&ldquo;About a year. He was given to me when he was
just a little puppy.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And how old are you, son?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Ten my last birthday, but I&rsquo;m so big
for my age I wear &rsquo;leven-year-old suits.&rdquo;

Now the Towncrier hadn&rsquo;t intended to stop, but
the dog began burrowing its head ecstatically against
him, and there was something in the boy&rsquo;s lonesome,
dirty little face which appealed to him, and the next
thing he knew he was sitting on the bottom step of
the Green Stairs with Georgina beside him, telling
the most thrilling pirate story he knew. And he told
it more thrillingly than he had ever told it before.
The reason for this was he had never had such a spellbound
listener before. Not even Justin had hung on each
word with the rapt interest this boy showed. His dark
eyes seemed to grow bigger and more luminous with each
sentence, more intense in their piercing gaze. His
sensitive mouth changed expression with every phase
of the adventure--danger, suspense, triumph. He scarcely
breathed, he was listening so hard.

Suddenly the whistle at the cold-storage plant began
to blow for noon, and the old man rose stiffly, saying:

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a long way from home, I should have
started back sooner.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, but you haven&rsquo;t finished the story!&rdquo;
cried the boy, in distress at this sudden ending.
&ldquo;It _couldn&rsquo;t_ stop there.&rdquo;

Georgina caught him by the sleeve of the old blue
jacket to pull him back to the seat beside her.

&ldquo;Please, Uncle Darcy!&rdquo;

It was the first time in all her coaxing that that
magic word failed to bend him to her wishes.

&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered firmly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
finish it now, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll
do. This afternoon I&rsquo;ll row up to this end of
the beach in my dory and take you two children out
to the weirs to see the net hauled in. There&rsquo;s
apt to be a big catch of squid worth going to see,
and I&rsquo;ll finish the story on the way. Will that
suit you?&rdquo;

Richard stood up, as eager and excited as Captain
Kidd always was when anybody said &ldquo;Rats!&rdquo;
But the next instant the light died out of his eyes
and he plumped himself gloomily down on the step, as
if life were no longer worth living.

&ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I forgot.
I can&rsquo;t go anywhere. Dad&rsquo;s painting my
portrait, and I have to stick around so&rsquo;s he
can work on it any old time he feels like it. That&rsquo;s
why he brought me on this visit with him, so&rsquo;s
he can finish it up here.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Maybe you can beg off, just for to-day,&rdquo;
suggested Mr. Darcy.

&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s very important,&rdquo; he explained
gravely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best one Daddy&rsquo;s
done yet, and the last thing before we left home Aunt
Letty said, &rsquo;Whatever you do, boys, don&rsquo;t
let anything interfere with getting that picture done
in time to hang in the exhibition,&rsquo; and we both
promised.&rdquo;

There was gloomy silence for a moment, broken by the
old man&rsquo;s cheerful voice.

&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you worry till you see what
we can do. I want to see your father anyhow about
this bill-case business, so I&rsquo;ll come around
this afternoon, and if he doesn&rsquo;t let you off
to-day maybe he will to-morrow. Just trust your Uncle
Darcy for getting where he starts out to go. Skip
along home, Georgina, and tell your mother I want to
borrow you for the afternoon.&rdquo;

An excited little pink whirlwind with a jumping rope
going over and over its head, went flying up the street
toward the end of the beach. A smiling old man with
age looking out of his faded blue eyes but with the
spirit of boyhood undimmed in his heart, walked slowly
down towards the town. And on the bottom step of the
Green Stairs, his arm around Captain Kidd, the boy
sat watching them, looking from one to the other as
long as they were in sight. The heart of him was pounding
deliciously to the music of such phrases as, _"Fathoms
deep, lonely beach, spade and pickaxe, skull and crossbones,
bags of golden doubloons and chests of ducats and
pearls!"_



Chapter V
In the Footsteps of Pirates

The weirs, to which they took their way that afternoon
in the Towncrier&rsquo;s dory, _The Betsey_,
was &ldquo;the biggest fish-trap in any waters thereabouts,&rdquo;
the old man told them. And it happened that the net
held an unusually large catch that day. Barrels and
barrels of flapping squid and mackerel were emptied
into the big motor boat anchored alongside of it.

At a word from Uncle Darcy, an obliging fisherman
in oilskins held out his hand to help the children
scramble over the side of _The Betsey_ to
a seat on top of the cabin where they could have a
better view. All the crew were Portuguese. The man
who helped them climb over was Joe Fayal, father of
Manuel and Joseph and Rosa. He stood like a young brown
Neptune, his white teeth flashing when he laughed,
a pitchfork in his hands with which to spear the goosefish
as they turned up in the net, and throw them back
into the sea. If nothing else had happened that sight
alone was enough to mark it as a memorable afternoon.

Nothing else did happen, really, except that on the
way out, Uncle Darcy finished the story begun on the
Green Stairs and on the way back told them another.
But what Richard remembered ever after as seeming to
have happened, was that _The Betsey_ suddenly
turned into a Brigantine. Perched up on one of the
masts, an unseen spectator, he watched a mutiny flare
up among the sailors, and saw that &ldquo;strutting,
swaggering villain, John Quelch, throw the captain
overboard and take command himself.&rdquo; He saw
them hoist a flag they called &ldquo;Old Roger,&rdquo;
&ldquo;having in the middle of it an Anatomy (skeleton)
with an hour-glass in one hand and a dart in the heart
with three drops of blood proceeding from it.&rdquo;

He heard the roar that went up from all those bearded
throats--(wonderful how Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s thin,
quavering voice could sound that whole chorus)----

&ldquo;Of all the lives, I ever say,
A Pirate&rsquo;s be for I.
Hap what hap may, he&rsquo;s allus gay
An&rsquo; drinks an&rsquo; bungs his eye.
For his work he&rsquo;s never loth,
An&rsquo; a-pleasurin&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll go
Tho&rsquo; certain sure to be popt of.
Yo ho, with the rum below."&lt;/i&gt;

And then they made after the Portuguese vessels, nine
of them, and took them all (What a bloody fight it
was!), and sailed away with a dazzling store of treasure,
&ldquo;enough to make an honest sailorman rub his eyes
and stagger in his tracks.&rdquo;

Richard had not been brought up on stories as Georgina
had. He had had few of this kind, and none so breathlessly
realistic. It carried him out of himself so completely
that as they rowed slowly back to town he did not
see a single house in it, although every western window-pane
flashed back the out-going sun like a golden mirror.
His serious, brown eyes were following the adventures
of these bold sea-robbers, &ldquo;marooned three times
and wounded nine and blowed up in the air.&rdquo;

When all of a sudden the brigantine changed back into
_The Betsey_, and he had to climb out at
the boat-landing, he had somewhat of the dazed feeling
of that honest sailor-man. He had heard enough to make
him &ldquo;rub his eyes and stagger in his tracks.&rdquo;

Uncle Darcy, having put them ashore, rowed off with
the parting injunction to skip along home. Georgina
did skip, so light of foot and quick of movement that
she was in the lead all the way to the Green Stairs.
There she paused and waited for Richard to join her.
As he came up he spoke for the first time since leaving
the weirs.

&ldquo;Wish I knew the boys in this town. Wish I knew
which one would be the best to get to go digging with
me.&rdquo;

Georgina did not need to ask, &ldquo;digging for what?&rdquo;
She, too, had been thinking of buried treasure.

&ldquo;_I&rsquo;ll_ go with you,&rdquo;
she volunteered sweetly.

He turned on her an inquiring look, as if he were
taking her measure, then glanced away indifferently.

&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re a girl.&rdquo;

It was a matter-of-fact statement with no suspicion
of a taunt in it, but it stung Georgina&rsquo;s pride.
Her eyes blazed defiantly and she tossed back her
curls with a proud little uplift of the chin. It must
be acknowledged that her nose, too, took on the trifle
of a tilt. Her challenge was unspoken but so evident
that he answered it.

&ldquo;Well, you know you couldn&rsquo;t creep out
into the night and go along a lonely shore into dark
caves and everything.&rdquo;

&ldquo;_Pity_ I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she
answered with withering scorn. &ldquo;I could go anywhere
_you_ could, anybody descended from heroes
like _I_ am. I don&rsquo;t want to be braggity,
but I&rsquo;d have you to know they put up that big
monument over there for one of them, and another was
a Minute-man. With all that, for you to think I&rsquo;d
be afraid! _Tut!_&rdquo;

Not Tippy herself had ever spoken that word with finer
scorn. With a flirt of her short skirts Georgina turned
and started disdainfully up the street.

&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; called Richard. He liked the sudden
flare-up of her manner. There was something convincing
about it. Besides, he didn&rsquo;t want her to go off
in that independent way as if she meant never to come
back. It was she who had brought the Towncrier, that
matchless Teller of Tales, across his path.

&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you wasn&rsquo;t brave,&rdquo;
he called after her.

She hesitated, then stopped, turning half-way around.

&ldquo;I just said you was a girl. Most of them _are_
&rsquo;fraid cats, but if you ain&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t
know as I&rsquo;d mind taking you along. That is,&rdquo;
he added cautiously, &ldquo;if I could be dead sure
that you&rsquo;re game.&rdquo;

At that Georgina turned all the way around and came
back a few steps.

&ldquo;You can try me,&rdquo; she answered, anxious
to prove herself worthy to be taken on such a quest,
and as eager as he to begin it.

&ldquo;You think of the thing you&rsquo;re most afraid
of yourself, and tell me to do it, and then just watch
me.&rdquo;

Richard declined to admit any fear of anything. Georgina
named several terrors at which he stoutly shook his
head, but presently with uncanny insight she touched
upon his weakest point.

&ldquo;Would you be afraid of coffins and spooks or
to go to a graveyard in the dead of the night the
way Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn did?&rdquo;

Not having read Tom Sawyer, Richard evaded the question
by asking, &ldquo;How did they do?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you know? They had the dead
cat and they saw old Injun Joe come with the lantern
and kill the man that was with Muff Potter.&rdquo;

By the time Georgina had given the bare outline of
the story in her dramatic way, Richard was quite sure
that no power under heaven could entice him into a
graveyard at midnight, though nothing could have induced
him to admit this to Georgina. As far back as he could
remember he had had an unreasoning dread of coffins.
Even now, big as he was, big enough to wear &ldquo;&rsquo;leven-year-old
suits,&rdquo; nothing could tempt him into a furniture
shop for fear of seeing a coffin.

One of his earliest recollections was of his nurse
taking him into a little shop, at some village where
they were spending the summer, and his cold terror
when he found himself directly beside a long brown
one, smelling of varnish, and with silver handles.
His nurse&rsquo;s tales had much to do with creating
this repulsion, also her threat of shutting him up
in a coffin if he wasn&rsquo;t a good boy. When she
found that she could exact obedience by keeping that
dread hanging over him, she used the threat daily.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo;
he said finally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you go digging
with me if you&rsquo;re game enough to go to the graveyard
and walk clear across it all by yourself and&rdquo;--dropping
his voice to a hollow whisper-- &ldquo;_touch--ten--tombstones!_&rdquo;

Now, if Richard hadn&rsquo;t dropped his voice in
that scary way when he said, &ldquo;and touch ten
tombstones,&rdquo; it would have been no test at all
of Georgina&rsquo;s courage. Strange, how just his
way of saying those four words suddenly made the act
such a fearsome one.

&ldquo;Do it right now,&rdquo; he suggested.

&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t night yet,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;let alone being mid-night.&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s clouding up, and the sun&rsquo;s
down. By the time we&rsquo;d get to a graveyard it
would be dark enough for me to tell if you&rsquo;re
game.&rdquo;

Up to this time Georgina had never gone anywhere without
permission. But this was something one couldn&rsquo;t
explain very well at home. It seemed better to do
it first and explain afterward.

Fifteen minutes later, two children and a dog arrived
hot and panting at the entrance to the old burying
ground. On a high sand dune, covered with thin patches
of beach and poverty grass, and a sparse growth of
scraggly pines, it was a desolate spot at any time,
and now doubly so in the gathering twilight. The lichen-covered
slabs that marked the graves of the early settlers
leaned this way and that along the hill.

The gate was locked, but Georgina found a place where
the palings were loose, and squeezed through, leaving
Richard and the dog outside. They watched her through
the fence as she toiled up the steep hill. The sand
was so deep that she plunged in over her shoe-tops
at every step. Once on top it was easier going. The
matted beach grass made a firm turf. She stopped and
read the names on some of the slabs before she plucked
up courage to touch one. She would not have hesitated
an instant if only Richard had not dared her in that
scary way.

Some little, wild creature started up out of the grass
ahead of her and scurried away. Her heart beat so
fast she could hear the blood pounding against her
ear-drums. She looked back. Richard was watching, and
she was to wave her hand each time she touched a stone
so that he could keep count with her. She stooped
and peered at one, trying to read the inscription.
The clouds had hurried the coming of twilight. It was
hard to decipher the words.

&ldquo;None knew him but to love him,&rdquo; she read
slowly. Instantly her dread of the place vanished.
She laid her hand on the stone and then waved to Richard.
Then she ran on and read and touched another. &ldquo;Lost
at sea,&rdquo; that one said, and under the next slabs
slept &ldquo;Deliverance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Experience,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mercy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thankful.&rdquo; What
queer names people had in those early days! And what
strange pictures they etched in the stone of those
old gray slabs--urns and angels and weeping willows!

She signaled the tenth and last. Richard wondered
why she did not turn and come back. At the highest
point of the hill she stood as if transfixed, a slim
little silhouette against the darkening sky, her hands
clasped in amazement. Suddenly she turned and came
tearing down the hill, floundering through sand, falling
and picking herself up, only to flounder and fall
again, finally rolling down the last few yards of the
embankment.

&ldquo;What scared you?&rdquo; asked Richard, his
eyes big with excitement as he watched what seemed
to be her terrified exit. &ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo;
But she would not speak until she had squeezed between
the palings and stood beside him. Then she told him
in an impressive whisper, glancing furtively over
her shoulder:

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole row of tombstones up
there with _skulls and cross-bones on them! They
must be pirate graves!"_

Her mysterious air was so contagious that he answered
in a whisper, and in a moment each was convinced by
the other&rsquo;s mere manner that their suspicion
was true. Presently Georgina spoke in her natural voice.

&ldquo;You go up and look at them.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Naw, I&rsquo;ll take your word for it,&rdquo;
he answered in a patronizing tone. &ldquo;Besides,
there isn&rsquo;t time now. It&rsquo;s getting too
dark. They&rsquo;ll be expecting me home to supper.&rdquo;

Georgina glanced about her. The clouds settling heavily
made it seem later than it really was. She had a guilty
feeling that Barby was worrying about her long absence,
maybe imagining that something had happened to _The
Betsey_. She startad homeward, half running,
but her pace slackened as Richard, hurrying along
beside her, began to plan what they would do with
their treasure when they found it.

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s sure to be piles of buried gold
around here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Those pirate graves
prove that a lot of &rsquo;em lived here once. Let&rsquo;s
buy a moving picture show first.&rdquo;

Georgina&rsquo;s face grew radiant at this tacit admission
of herself into partnership.

&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she assented joyfully. &ldquo;And
then we can have moving pictures made of _us_
doing all sorts of things. Won&rsquo;t it be fun to
sit back and watch ourselves and see how we look doing
&rsquo;em?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Say! that&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;All the kids in town will want to be in the
pictures, too, but we&rsquo;ll have the say-so, and
only those who do exactly to suit us can have a chance
of getting in.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But the more we let in the more money we&rsquo;d
make in the show,&rdquo; was Georgina&rsquo;s shrewd
answer. &ldquo;Everybody will want to see what their
child looks like in the movies, so, of course, that&rsquo;ll
make people come to our show instead of the other
ones.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; was the admiring reply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a partner worth having. You&rsquo;ve got a _head_.&rdquo;

Such praise was the sweetest incense to Georgina.
She burned to call forth more.

&ldquo;Oh, I can think of lots of things when once
I get started,&rdquo; she assured him with a grand
air.

As they ran along Richard glanced several times at
the head from which had come such valuable suggestions.
There was a gleam of gold in the brown curls which
bobbed over her shoulders. He liked it. He hadn&rsquo;t
noticed before that her hair was pretty.

There was a gleam of gold, also, in the thoughts of
each. They could fairly see the nuggets they were
soon to unearth, and their imaginations, each fired
by the other, shoveled out the coin which the picture
show was to yield them, in the same way that the fisherman
had shoveled the shining mackerel into the boat. They
had not attempted to count them, simply measured them
by the barrelful.

&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell anybody,&rdquo; Richard counseled
her as they parted at the Green Stairs. &ldquo;Cross
your heart and body you won&rsquo;t tell a soul. We
want to surprise &rsquo;em.&rdquo;

Georgina gave the required sign and promise, as gravely
as if it were an oath.

From the front porch Richard&rsquo;s father and cousin,
James Milford, watched him climb slowly up the Green
Stairs.

&ldquo;Dicky looks as if the affairs of the nation
were on his shoulders,&rdquo; observed Cousin James.
&ldquo;Pity he doesn&rsquo;t realize these are his
care-free days.&rdquo;

&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; answered the elder
Richard. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the most deadly serious
ones he&rsquo;ll ever have. I don&rsquo;t know what
he&rsquo;s got on his mind now, but whatever it is
I&rsquo;ll wager it is more important business than
that deal you&rsquo;re trying to pull off with the
Cold Storage people.&rdquo;



Chapter VI
Spend-the-Day Guests

There was a storm that night and next day a heavy
fog dropped down like a thick white veil over town
and sea. It was so cold that Jeremy lighted a fire,
not only in the living room but in the guest chamber
across the hall.

A week earlier Tippy had announced, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
never do to let Cousin Mehitable Huntingdon go back
to Hyannis without having broken bread with us. She&rsquo;d
talk about it to the end of her days, if we were the
only relations in town who failed to ask her in to
a meal, during her fortnight&rsquo;s visit. And, of
course, if we ask her, all the family she&rsquo;s
staying with ought to be invited, and we&rsquo;ve never
had the new minister and his wife here to eat. Might
as well do it all up at once while we&rsquo;re about
it.&rdquo;

Spend-the-day guests were rare in Georgina&rsquo;s
experience. The grand preparations for their entertainment
which went on that morning put the new partnership
and the treasure-quest far into the back-ground. She
forgot it entirely while the dining-room table, stretched
to its limit, was being set with the best china and
silver as if for a Thanksgiving feast. Mrs. Fayal,
the mother of Manuel and Joseph and Rosa, came over
to help in the kitchen, and Tippy whisked around so
fast that Georgina, tagging after, was continually
meeting her coming back.

Georgina was following to ask questions about the
expected guests. She liked the gruesome sound of that
term &ldquo;blood relations&rdquo; as Tippy used it,
and wanted to know all about this recently discovered
&ldquo;in-law,&rdquo; the widow of her grandfather&rsquo;s
cousin, Thomas Huntingdon. Barby could not tell her
and Mrs. Triplett, too busy to be bothered, set her
down to turn the leaves of the family album. But the
photograph of Cousin Mehitable had been taken when
she was a boarding-school miss in a disfiguring hat
and basque, and bore little resemblance to the imposing
personage who headed the procession of visitors, arriving
promptly at eleven o&rsquo;clock.

When Cousin Mehitable came into the room in her widow&rsquo;s
bonnet with the long black veil hanging down behind,
she seemed to fill the place as the massive black
walnut wardrobe upstairs filled the alcove. She lifted
her eyeglasses from the hook on her dress to her hooked
nose to look at Georgina before she kissed her. Under
that gaze the child felt as awed as if the big wardrobe
had bent over and put a wooden kiss on her forehead
and said in a deep, whispery sort of voice, &ldquo;So
this is the Judge&rsquo;s grand-daughter. How do you
do, my dear?&rdquo;

All the guests were middle aged and most of them portly.
There were so many that they filled all the chairs
and the long claw-foot sofa besides. Georgina sat
on a foot-stool, her hands folded in her lap until
the others took out their knitting and embroidery.
Then she ran to get the napkin she was hemming. The
husbands who had been invited did not arrive until
time to sit down to dinner and they left immediately
after the feast.

Georgina wished that everybody would keep still and
let one guest at a time do the talking. After the
first few minutes of general conversation the circle
broke into little groups, and it wasn&rsquo;t possible
to follow the thread of the story in more than one.
Each group kept bringing to light some bit of family
history that she wanted to hear or some old family
joke which they laughed over as if it were the funniest
thing that ever happened. It was tantalizing not to
be able to hear them all. It made her think of times
when she rummaged through the chests in the attic,
pulling out fascinating old garments and holding them
up for Tippy to supply their history. But this was
as bad as opening all the chests at once. While she
was busy with one she was missing all that was being
hauled out to the light of day from the others.

Several times she moved her foot-stool from one group
to another, drawn by some sentence such as, &ldquo;Well,
she certainly was the prettiest bride I ever laid
my two eyes on, but not many of us would want to stand
in her shoes now.&rdquo; Or from across the room,
&ldquo;They do say it was what happened the night
of the wreck that unbalanced his mind, but I&rsquo;ve
always thought it was having things go at sixes and
sevens at home as they did.&rdquo;

Georgina would have settled herself permanently near
Cousin Mehitable, she being the most dramatic and
voluble of them all, but she had a tantalizing way
of lowering her voice at the most interesting part,
and whispering the last sentence behind her hand.
Georgina was nearly consumed with curiosity each time
that happened, and fairly ached to know these whispered
revelations.

It was an entrancing day--the dinner so good, the
ancient jokes passing around the table all so new
and witty to Georgina, hearing them now for the first
time. She wished that a storm would come up to keep
everybody at the house overnight and thus prolong
the festal feeling. She liked this &ldquo;Company&rdquo;
atmosphere in which everyone seemed to grow expansive
of soul and gracious of speech. She loved every relative
she had to the remotest &ldquo;in-law.&rdquo;

Her heart swelled with a great thankfulness to think
that she was not an orphan. Had she been one there
would have been no one to remark that her eyes were
exactly like Justin&rsquo;s and she carried herself
like a Huntingdon, but that she must have inherited
her smile from the other side of the house. Barbara
had that same smile and winning way with her. It was
pleasant to be discussed when only pleasant things
were said, and to have her neat stitches exclaimed
over and praised as they were passed around.

She thought about it again after dinner, and felt
so sorry for children who were orphans, that she decided
to spend a large part of her share of the buried treasure
in making them happy. She was sure that Richard would
give part of his share, too, when he found it, and
when the picture show which they were going to buy
was in good running order, they would make it a rule
that orphans should always be let in free.

She came back from this pleasant day-dream to hear
Cousin Mehitable saying, &ldquo;Speaking of thieves,
does anyone know what ever became of poor Dan Darcy?&rdquo;

Nobody knew, and they all shook their heads and said
that it was a pity that he had turned out so badly.
It was hard to believe it of him when he had always
been such a kind, pleasant-spoken boy, just like his
father; and if ever there was an honest soul in the
whole round world it was the old Town-crier.

At that Georgina gave such a start that she ran, her
needle into her thumb, and a tiny drop of blood spurted
out. She did not know that Uncle Darcy had a son.
She had never heard his name mentioned before. She
had been at his house many a time, and there never
was anyone there besides himself except his wife,
&ldquo;Aunt Elspeth&rdquo; (who was so old and feeble
that she stayed in bed most of the time), and the
three cats, &ldquo;John Darcy and Mary Darcy and old
Yellownose.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the way the old man
always spoke of them. He called them his family.

Georgina was glad that the minister&rsquo;s wife was
a newcomer in the town and asked to have it explained.
Everybody contributed a scrap of the story, for all
side conversations stopped at the mention of Dan Darcy&rsquo;s
name, and the interest of the whole room centered
on him.

It was years ago, when he was not more than eighteen
that it happened. He was a happy-go-lucky sort of
fellow who couldn&rsquo;t be kept down to steady work
such as a job in the bank or a store. He was always
off a-fishing or on the water, but everybody liked
him and said he&rsquo;d settle down when he was a
bit older. He had a friend much like himself, only
a little older. Emmett Potter was his name. There
was a regular David and Jonathan friendship between
those two. They were hand-in-glove in everything till
Dan went wrong. Both even liked the same girl, Belle
Triplett.

Here Georgina&rsquo;s needle gave her another jab.
She laid down her hemming to listen. This was bringing
the story close home, for Belle Triplett was Tippy&rsquo;s
niece, or rather her husband&rsquo;s niece. While that
did not make Belle one of the Huntingdon family, Georgina
had always looked upon her as such. She visited at
the house oftener than anyone else.

Nobody in the room came right out and said what it
was that Dan had done, but by putting the scraps together
Georgina discovered presently that the trouble was
about some stolen money. Lots of people wouldn&rsquo;t
believe that he was guilty at first, but so many things
pointed his way that finally they had to. The case
was about to be brought to trial when one night Dan
suddenly disappeared as if the sea had swallowed him,
and nothing had ever been heard from him since. Judge
Huntingdon said it was a pity, for even if he was
guilty he thought he could have got him off, there
being nothing but circumstantial evidence.

Well, it nearly killed his father and mother and Emmett
Potter, too.

It came out then that Emmett was engaged to Belle.
For nearly a year he grieved about Dan&rsquo;s disappearance.
Seems he took it to heart so that he couldn&rsquo;t
bear to do any of the things they&rsquo;d always done
together or go to the old places. Belle had her wedding
dress made and thought if she could once get him down
to Truro to live, he&rsquo;d brace up and get over
it.

They had settled on the day, when one wild, stormy
night word came that a vessel was pounding itself
to pieces off Peaked Hill Bar, and the life-saving
crew was starting to the rescue. Emmett lit out to
see it, and when something happened to the breeches
buoy so they couldn&rsquo;t use it, he was the first
to answer when the call came for volunteers to man
a boat to put out to them. He would have had a medal
if he&rsquo;d lived to wear it, for he saved five
lives that night. But he lost his own the last time
he climbed up on the vessel. Nobody knew whether it
was a rope gave way or whether his fingers were so
nearly frozen he couldn&rsquo;t hold on, but he dropped
into that raging sea, and his body was washed up on
the beach next day.

Georgina listened, horrified.

&ldquo;And Belle with her wedding dress all ready,&rdquo;
said Cousin Mehitable with a husky sigh.

&ldquo;What became of her?&rdquo; asked the minister&rsquo;s
wife.

&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s still living here in town,
but it blighted her whole life in a way, although
she was just in her teens when it happened. It helped
her to bear up, knowing he&rsquo;d died such a hero.
Some of the town people put up a tombstone to his
memory, with a beautiful inscription on it that the
summer people go to see, almost as much as the landing
place of the Pilgrims. She&rsquo;ll be true to his
memory always, and it&rsquo;s something beautiful
to see her devotion to Emmett&rsquo;s father. She calls
him &lsquo;Father&rsquo; Potter, and is always doing
things for him. He&rsquo;s that old net-mender who
lives alone out on the edge of town near the cranberry
bogs.&rdquo;

Cousin Mehitable took up the tale:

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget if I live to be a hundred,
what I saw on my way home the night after Emmett was
drowned. I was living here then, you know. I was passing
through Fishburn Court, and I thought I&rsquo;d go
in and speak a word to Mr. Darcy, knowing how fond
he&rsquo;d always been of Emmett on account of Dan
and him being such friends. I went across that sandy
place they call the Court, to the row of cottages
at the end. But I didn&rsquo;t see anything until
I had opened the Darcy&rsquo;s gate and stepped into
the yard. The house sits sideways to the Court, you
know.

&ldquo;The yellow blind was pulled down over the front
window, but the lamp threw a shadow on it, plain as
a photograph. It was the shadow of the old man, sitting
there with his arms flung out across the table, and
his head bowed down on them. I was just hesitating,
whether to knock or to slip away, when I heard him
groan, and sort of cry out, &rsquo;Oh, my Danny! My
Danny! If only you could have gone _that_
way.&rsquo;&rdquo;

Barbara, hearing a muffled sob behind her, turned
to see the tears running down Georgina&rsquo;s face.
The next instant she was up, and with her arms around
the child, was gently pushing her ahead of her out
of the room, into the hall. With the door shut behind
her she said soothingly:

&ldquo;Barby didn&rsquo;t know they were going to
tell such unhappy stories, darling. I shouldn&rsquo;t
have let you stay.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But I _want_ to know,&rdquo; sobbed
Georgina. &ldquo;When people you love have trouble
you ought to know, so&rsquo;s to be kinder to them.
Oh, Barby, I&rsquo;m so sorry I ever was saucy to
him. And I wish I hadn&rsquo;t teased his cats. I
tied paper bags on all of John Darcy and Mary Darcy&rsquo;s
paws, and he said I made old Y-yellownose n-nervous,
tickling his ears----&rdquo;

Barbara stopped the sobbing confessions with a kiss
and took Georgina&rsquo;s jacket from the hatrack.

&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad
for you to sit in the house all day and listen to
grown people talk. Slip into this and run outdoors
with your skipping rope a while. Uncle Darcy has had
very great trouble, but he&rsquo;s learned to bear
it like a hero, and nothing would make him grieve more
than to know that any shadow of his sorrow was making
you unhappy. The way for you to help him most is to
be as bright and jolly as you can, and to _tease_
his old cats once in a while.&rdquo;

Georgina looked up through her tears, her dimples
all showing, and threw her arms around her adoringly.

&ldquo;What a funny mother you are, Barby. Not a bit
like the ones in books.&rdquo;

A cold wind was blowing the fog away. She raced up
and down the beach for a long time, and when she came
back it was with red cheeks and ruffled curls. Having
left the company in tears she did not like to venture
back for fear of the remarks which might be made.
So she crossed the hall and stood in the door of the
guest chamber, considering what to do next. Its usual
chill repellance had been changed into something inviting
by the wood fire on the hearth, and on the bed where
the guests had deposited their wraps lay an array
of millinery which drew her irresistibly.

It was a huge four-poster bed which one could mount
only by the aid of a set of bedside steps, and so
high that the valance, draped around it like a skirt,
would have reached from her neck to her heels had it
been draped on her. It was a chintz valance with birds
of paradise patterned on its pink back-ground, and
there was pink silk quilled into the quaint tester
overhead, reminding her of old Jeremy&rsquo;s favorite
quill dahlias.

Usually when she went into this room which was seldom
opened, she mounted the steps to gaze up at that fascinating
pink loveliness. Also she walked around the valance,
counting its birds of paradise. She did not do so to-day.
She knew from many previous countings that there were
exactly eighty-seven and a half of those birds. The
joining seam cut off all but the magnificent tail
of what would have been the eighty-eighth.

Mounting the steps she leaned over, careful not to
touch the crocheted counterpane, which Tippy always
treated as if it were something sacred, and looked
at the hats spread out upon it. Then she laid daring
fingers on Cousin Mehitable&rsquo;s bonnet. It was
a temptation to know what she would look like if she
should grow up to be a widow and have to wear an imposing
head-gear like that with a white ruche in front and
a long black veil floating down behind. The next instant
she was tying the strings under her chin.

It made her look like such an odd little dwarf of
a woman that she stuck out her tongue at her reflection
in the mirror. The grimace was so comical, framed
by the stately bonnet, that Georgina was delighted.
She twisted her face another way and was still more
amused at results. Wholly forgetful of the fact that
it was a mourning bonnet, she went on making faces
at herself until the sound of voices suddenly growing
louder, told her that the door across the hall had
opened. Someone was coming across.

There was no time to take off the bonnet. With a frightened
gasp she dived under the bed, with it still on, her
heels disappearing just as someone came into the room.
The bed was so high she could easily sit upright under
it, but she was so afraid that a cough or a sneeze
might betray her, that she drew up her knees and sat
with her face pressed against them hard. The long
veil shrouded her shoulders. She felt that she would
surely die if anyone should notice that the bonnet
was gone, or happen to lift the valance and find her
sitting there with it on her head. Then she forgot
her fear in listening to what Cousin Mehitable was
saying.



Chapter VII
&ldquo;The Tishbite&rdquo;

Cousin Mehitable was speaking to Mrs. Triplett, who
seemed to be searching through bureau drawers for
something. Georgina could tell what she was doing
from the sounds which reached her. These drawers always
stuck, and had to be jerked violently until the mirror
rattled.

&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother about it, Maria. I just
made an excuse of wanting to see it, because I knew
you always kept it in here, and I wanted to get you
off by yourself for a minute&rsquo;s talk with you
alone. Since I&rsquo;ve been in town I&rsquo;ve heard
so much about Justin and the way he is doing that I
wanted to ask somebody who knew and who could tell
me the straight of it. What&rsquo;s this about his
leaving the service and going junketing off to the
interior of China on some mission of his own? Jane
tells me he got a year&rsquo;s leave of absence from
the Navy just to study up some outlandish disease
that attacks the sailors in foreign ports. She says
why should he take a whole year out of the best part
of his life to poke around the huts of dirty heathen
to find out the kind of microbe that&rsquo;s eating
&rsquo;em? He&rsquo;d ought to think of Barbara and
what&rsquo;s eating her heart out. I&rsquo;ve taken
a great fancy to that girl, and I&rsquo;d like to give
Justin a piece of my mind. It probably wouldn&rsquo;t
do a bit of good though. He always was peculiar.&rdquo;

Georgina could hear only a few words of the answer
because Tippy had her head in the closet now, reaching
for the box on the top shelf. She stopped her search
as soon as Cousin Mehitable said that, and the two
of them went over to the fire and talked in low tones
for a few minutes, leaning against the mantel. Georgina
heard a word now and then. Several times it was her
own name. Finally, in a louder tone Cousin Mehitable
said:

&ldquo;Well, I wanted to know, and I was sure you
could tell me if anyone could.&rdquo;

They went back across the hall to the other guests.
The instant they were gone Georgina crawled out from
under the bed with the big bonnet cocked over one
eye. Then she scudded down the hall and up the back
stairs. She knew the company would be going soon,
and she would be expected to bid them good-bye if
she were there. She didn&rsquo;t want Cousin Mehitable
to kiss her again. She didn&rsquo;t like her any more
since she had called her father &ldquo;peculiar.&rdquo;

She wandered aimlessly about for a few minutes, then
pushed the door open into Mrs. Triplett&rsquo;s room.
It was warm and cozy in there for a small fire still
burned in the little drum stove. She opened the front
damper to make it burn faster, and the light shone
out in four long rays which made a flickering in the
room. She sat down on the floor in front of it and
began to wonder.

&ldquo;What did Cousin Mehitable mean by something
eating Barby&rsquo;s heart out?&rdquo; Did people
die of it? She had read of the Spartan youth who let
the fox gnaw his vitals under his cloak and never
showed, even by the twitching of a muscle, that he
was in pain. Of course, she knew that no live thing
was tearing at her mother&rsquo;s heart, but what if
something that she couldn&rsquo;t understand was hurting
her darling Barby night and day and she was bravely
hiding it from the world like the Spartan youth?

Did _all_ grown people have troubles? It
had seemed such a happy world until to-day, and now
all at once she had heard about Dan Darcy and Belle
Triplett. Nearly everyone whom the guests talked about
had borne some unhappiness, and even her own father
was &ldquo;peculiar.&rdquo; She wished she hadn&rsquo;t
found out all these things. A great weight seemed to
settle down upon her.

Thinking of Barbara in the light of what she had just
learned she recalled that she often looked sorry and
disappointed, especially after the postman had come
and gone without leaving a letter. Only this morning
Tippy had said--could it be she thought something was
wrong and was trying to comfort her?

&ldquo;Justin always was a poor hand for writing letters.
Many a time I&rsquo;ve heard the Judge scolding and
stewing around because he hadn&rsquo;t heard from
him when he was away at school. Letter writing came
so easy to the Judge he couldn&rsquo;t understand
why Justin shirked it so.&rdquo;

Then Georgina thought of Belle in the light of what
she had just learned. Belle had carried her around
in her arms when she was first brought to live in
this old gray house by the sea. She had made a companion
of her whenever she came to visit her Aunt Maria,
and Georgina had admired her because she was so pretty
and blonde and gentle, and enjoyed her because she
was always so willing to do whatever Georgina wished.
And now to think that instead of being the like-everybody-else
kind of a young lady she seemed, she was like a heroine
in a book who had lived through trouble which would
&ldquo;blight her whole life.&rdquo;

Sitting there on the floor with her knees drawn up
and her chin resting on them, Georgina looked into
the fire through the slits of the damper and thought
and thought. Then she looked out through the little
square window-panes across the wind-swept dunes. It
did not seem like summer with the sky all overcast
with clouds. It was more like the end of a day in
the early autumn. Life seemed overcast, too.

Presently through a rift in the sky an early star
stole out, and she made a wish on it. That was one
of the things Belle had taught her. She started to
wish that Barby might be happy. But before the whispered
verse had entirely passed her lips she stopped to
amend it, adding Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s name and Belle&rsquo;s.
Then she stopped again, overcome by the knowledge
of all the woe in the world, and gathering all the
universe into her generous little heart she exclaimed
earnestly:

&ldquo;I wish _everybody in the world could be
happy_.&rdquo;

Having made the wish, fervently, almost fiercely,
in her intense desire to set things right, she scrambled
to her feet. There was another thing that Belle had
told her which she must do.

&ldquo;If you open the Bible and it chances to be
at a chapter beginning with the words, &lsquo;It came
to pass,&rsquo; the wish will come true without fail.&rdquo;

Taking Tippy&rsquo;s Bible from the stand beside the
bed, she opened it at random, then carried it over
to the stove in order to scan the pages by the firelight
streaming through the damper. The book opened at First
Kings, seventeenth chapter. She held it directly in
the broad rays examining the pages anxiously. There
was only that one chapter head on either page, and
alas, its opening words were not &ldquo;it came to
pass.&rdquo; What she read with a sinking heart was:

_"And Elijah the Tishbite."_

Now Georgina hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea what
a Tishbite was, but it sounded as if it were something
dreadful. Somehow it is a thousand times worse to
be scared by a fear which is not understood than by
one which is familiar. Suddenly she felt as bewildered
and frightened as she had on that morning long ago,
when Jeremy&rsquo;s teeth went flying into the fire.
The happiness of her whole little world seemed to
be going to pieces.

Throwing herself across the foot of Tippy&rsquo;s
bed she crawled under the afghan thrown over it, even
burrowing her head beneath it in order to shut out
the dreadful things closing down on her. It had puzzled
and frightened her to know that something was eating
Barby&rsquo;s heart out, even in a figurative way,
and now the word &ldquo;Tishbite&rdquo; filled her
with a vague sense of helplessness and impending disaster.

Barbara, coming upstairs to hunt her after the guests
were gone, found her sound asleep with the afghan
still over her head. She folded it gently back from
the flushed face, not intending to waken her, but
Georgina&rsquo;s eyes opened and after a bewildered
stare around the room she sat up, remembering. She
had wakened to a world of trouble. Somehow it did
not seem quite so bad with Barbara standing over her,
smiling. When she went downstairs a little later,
freshly washed and brushed, the Tishbite rolled out
of her thoughts as a fog lifts when the sun shines.

But it came back at bedtime, when having said her
prayers, she joined her voice with Barbara&rsquo;s
in the hymn that had been her earliest lullaby. It
was a custom never omitted. It always closed the day
for her:

&ldquo;Eternal Father, strong to save,
Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,
Oh, hear us when we cry to thee
For those in peril on the sea."

As they sang she stole an anxious glance at Barbara
several times. Then she made up her mind that Cousin
Mehitable was mistaken. If her father were &ldquo;peculiar,&rdquo;
Barby wouldn&rsquo;t have that sweet look on her face
when she sang that prayer for him. If he were making
her unhappy she wouldn&rsquo;t be singing it at all.
She wouldn&rsquo;t care whether he was protected or
not &ldquo;from rock and tempest, fire and foe.&rdquo;

And yet, after Barby had gone downstairs and the sound
of the piano came softly up from below--another bedtime
custom, Georgina began thinking again about those
whispering voices which she had heard as she sat under
the bed, behind the bird-of-paradise valance. More
than ever before the music suggested someone waiting
for a ship which never came home, or fog bells on
a lonely shore.

Nearly a week went by before Richard made his first
visit to the old gray house at the end of town. He
came with the Towncrier, carrying his bell, and keeping
close to his side for the first few minutes. Then he
found the place far more interesting than the bungalow.
Georgina took him all over it, from the garret where
she played on rainy days to the seat up in the willow,
where standing in its highest crotch one could look
clear across the Cape to the Atlantic. They made several
plans for their treasure-quest while up in the willow.
They could see a place off towards Wood End Lighthouse
which looked like one of the pirate places Uncle Darcy
had described in one of his tales.

Barby had lemonade and cake waiting for them when
they came down, and when she talked to him it wasn&rsquo;t
at all in the way the ladies did who came to see his
Aunt Letty, as if they were talking merely to be gracious
and kind to a strange little boy in whom they had no
interest. Barby gave his ear a tweak and said with
a smile that made him feel as if they had known each
other always:

&ldquo;Oh, the good times I&rsquo;ve had with boys
just your size. I always played with my brother Eddy&rsquo;s
friends. Boys make such good chums. I&rsquo;ve often
thought how much Georgina misses that I had.&rdquo;

Presently Georgina took him out to the see-saw, where
Captain Kidd persisted in riding on Richard&rsquo;s
end of the plank.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly the way my Uncle Eddy&rsquo;s
terrier used to do back in Kentucky when I visited
there one summer,&rdquo; she said, after the plank
was adjusted so as to balance them properly. &ldquo;Only
he barked all the time he was riding. But he was fierce
because Uncle Eddy fed him gunpowder.&rdquo;

&ldquo;What did he do that for?&rdquo;

&ldquo;To keep him from being gun-shy. And Uncle Eddy
ate some, too, one time when he was little, because
the colored stable boy told him it would make him
game.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Did it?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether that did or not.
Something did though, for he&rsquo;s the gamest man
I know.&rdquo;

Richard considered this a moment and then said: &ldquo;I
wonder what it would do to Captain Kidd if I fed him
some.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it!&rdquo; exclaimed Georgina,
delighted with the suggestion. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
some hanging up in the old powder-horn over the dining-room
mantel. You have to give it to &rsquo;em in milk. Wait
a minute.&rdquo;

Jumping from the see-saw after giving fair warning,
she ran to one of the side windows.

&ldquo;Barby,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to give Captain Kidd some milk.&rdquo;

Barbara turned from her conversation with Uncle Darcy
to say:

&ldquo;Very well, if you can get it yourself. But
be careful not to disturb the pans that haven&rsquo;t
been skimmed. Tippy wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I know what to get it out of,&rdquo; called
Georgina, &ldquo;out of the blue pitcher.&rdquo;

Richard watched while she opened the refrigerator
door and poured some milk into a saucer.

&ldquo;Carry it in and put it on the kitchen table,&rdquo;
she bade him, &ldquo;while I get the powder.&rdquo;

When he followed her into the dining-room she was
upon a chair, reaching for the old powder horn, which
hung on a hook under the firearm that had done duty
in the battle of Lexington. Richard wanted to get his
hands on it, and was glad when she could not pull
out the wooden plug which stopped the small end of
the horn. She turned it over to him to open. He peered
into it, then shook it.

&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t more than a spoonful left
in it,&rdquo; he said.

&ldquo;Well, gunpowder is so strong you don&rsquo;t
need much. You know just a little will make a gun
go off. It mightn&rsquo;t be safe to feed him much.
Pour some out in your hand and drop it in the milk.&rdquo;

Richard slowly poured a small mound out into the hollow
of his hand, and passed the horn back to her, then
went to the kitchen whistling for Captain Kidd. Not
all of the powder went into the milk, however. The
last bit he swallowed himself, after looking at it
long and thoughtfully.

At the same moment, Georgina, before putting back
the plug, paused, looked all around, and poured out
a few grains into her own hand. If the Tishbite was
going to do anybody any harm, it would be well to be
prepared. She had just hastily swallowed it and was
hanging the horn back in place, when Richard returned.

&ldquo;He lapped up the last drop as if he liked it,&rdquo;
he reported. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see what happens.&rdquo;

Chapter VIII
The Telegram that Took Barby Away

The painting of Richard&rsquo;s portrait interfered
with the quest for buried treasure from day to day;
but unbeknown either to artist or model, the dreams
of that quest helped in the fashioning of the picture.
In the preliminary sittings in the studio at home
Richard&rsquo;s father found it necessary always to
begin with some exhortation such as:

&ldquo;Now, Dicky, this has _got_ to be
more than just a &rsquo;Study of a Boy&rsquo;s Head.&rsquo;
I want to show by the expression of your face that
it is an illustration of that poem, &rsquo;A boy&rsquo;s
will is the wind&rsquo;s will, and the thoughts of
youth are long, long thoughts.&rsquo; Chase that Binney
Rogers and his gang out of your mind for a while,
can&rsquo;t you, and think of something beside shinny
and the hokey-pokey man.&rdquo;

So far the portrait was satisfactory in that it was
a remarkably good likeness of an unusually good-looking
boy, but it was of a boy who seemed to be alertly
listening for such things as Binney&rsquo;s cat-call,
signaling him from the alley. Here by the sea there
was no need for such exhortations. No sooner was he
seated before the easel in the loft which served as
a studio, with its barn-like, double doors thrown open
above the water, than the rapt expression which his
father coveted, crept into his dark eyes. They grew
big and dreamy, following the white sails across the
harbor. He was planning the secret expedition he and
Georgina intended to undertake, just as soon as the
portrait was finished.

There were many preparations to make for it. They
would have to secrete tools and provisions; and in
a book from which Georgina read aloud whenever there
was opportunity, were descriptions of various rites
that it were well to perform. One was to sacrifice
a black cock, and sprinkle its blood upon the spot
before beginning to dig. Richard did not question
why this should be done. The book recommended it as
a practice which had been followed by some very famous
treasure hunters. If at times a certain wide-awake
and calculating gleam suddenly dispelled the dreaminess
of expression in which his father was exulting, it
was because a black Orpington rooster which daily
strayed from a nearby cottage to the beach below the
studio window, chose that moment to crow. Richard had
marked that black cock for the sacrifice. It was lordly
enough to bring success upon any enterprise.

In the meantime, as soon as his duties as model were
over each morning, he was out of the studio with a
whoop and up the beach as hard as he could run to
the Huntingdon house. By the time he reached it he
was no longer the artist&rsquo;s only son, hedged
about with many limitations which belonged to that
distinction. He was &ldquo;Dare-devil Dick, the Dread
Destroyer,&rdquo; and Georgina was &ldquo;Gory George,
the Menace of the Main.&rdquo;

Together they commanded a brigantine of their own.
Passers-by saw only an old sailboat anchored at the
deserted and rotting wharf up nearest the breakwater.
But the passers-by who saw only that failed to see
either Dare-devil Dick or Gory George. They saw, instead,
two children whose fierce mustachios were the streakings
of a burnt match, whose massive hoop ear-rings were
the brass rings from a curtain pole, whose faithful
following of the acts of Captain Quelch and other piratical
gentlemen was only the mimicry of play.

But Barbara knew how real they were, from the spotted
handkerchief tied around the &ldquo;bunged eye&rdquo;
of Dare-devil Dick, under his evil-looking slouch
hat, to the old horse pistol buckled to his belt. Gory
George wore the same. And Barbara knew what serious
business it was to them, even more serious than the
affairs of eating and drinking.

Tippy scolded when she found that her half-pint bottles
which she kept especially for cream had been smuggled
away in the hold of the brigantine. But without bottles
how could one give a realistic touch to the singing
of &ldquo;Yo ho, and the rum below&rdquo;?

And Tippy thought it was heathenish for Barbara to
let Georgina dress up in some little knickerbockers
and a roundabout which had been stored away with other
clothes worn by Justin as a small boy. But her disapproval
was beyond words when Barbara herself appeared at
the back door one morning, so cleverly disguised as
a gypsy, that Mrs. Triplett grudgingly handed out
some cold biscuits before she discovered the imposition.
The poor she was glad to feed, but she had no use
for an impudent, strolling gypsy.

&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, Tippy,&rdquo; pleaded
Barbara, laughing till the tears came. &ldquo;I _had_
to do it. I can&rsquo;t bear to feel that Georgina
is growing away from me--that she is satisfied to
leave me out of her games. Since she&rsquo;s so taken
up with that little Richard Moreland I don&rsquo;t
seem as necessary to her as I used to be. And I can&rsquo;t
bear that, Tippy, when I&rsquo;ve always been first
in everything with her. She&rsquo;s so necessary to
me.&rdquo;

Mrs. Triplett made no answer. She felt that she couldn&rsquo;t
do justice to the occasion. She doubted if the Pilgrim
monument itself could, even if it were to stretch
itself up to its full height and deliver a lecture
on the dignity of motherhood. She wondered what the
Mayflower mothers would have thought if they could
have met this modern one on the beach, with face stained
brown, playacting that she was a beggar of a gypsy.
How could she hope to be one of those written of in
Proverbs--&ldquo;Her children rise up and call her
blessed. Her own works praise her in the gates.&rdquo;

Tippy ate her dinner alone that day, glancing grimly
through the open window from time to time to the sand
dunes back of the house, where an old hag of a gypsy
in a short red dress with a gay bandanna knotted over
her head, broiled bacon and boiled corn over a smoky
campfire; and two swaggering villains who smelled
of tar and codfish (because of the old net which half-way
filled the brigantine), sucked the very cobs when the
corn was eaten from them, forever registering that
feast high above all other feasts in the tablet of
blessed memories.

The interruption to all this came as unexpectedly
as a clap of thunder from a clear sky. A messenger
boy on a wheel whirled up to the front gate with a
telegram. Tippy signed for it, not wanting the boy
to see Barbara in such outlandish dress, then carried
it out to the picnickers. She held it under her apron
until she reached them. Telegrams always spelled trouble
to Mrs. Triplett, but Barbara took this one from her
with a smiling thank you, without, rising from her
seat on the sand. Her father often telegraphed instead
of writing when away on his vacations, and she knew
he was up at a lake resort in Michigan, at an Editors&rsquo;
Convention. Telegrams had always been pleasant things
in her experience. But as she tore this open and read
she turned pale even under her brown stain.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s papa,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Hurt
in an automobile accident. They don&rsquo;t say how
bad--just hurt. And he wants me. I must take the first
train.&rdquo;

She looked up at Mrs. Triplett helplessly, not even
making an effort to rise from the sand, she was so
dazed and distressed by the sudden summons. It was
the first time she had ever had the shock of bad news.
It was the first time she had ever been called upon
to act for herself in such an emergency, and she felt
perfectly numb, mind and body. Tippy&rsquo;s voice
sounded a mile away when she said:

&ldquo;You can catch the boat. It&rsquo;s an hour
till the _Dorothy Bradford_ starts back
to Boston.&rdquo;

Still Barbara sat limp and powerless, as one sits
in a nightmare.

Georgina gave a choking gasp as two awful words rose
up in her throat and stuck there. _"The Tishbite."_
Whatever that mysterious horror might be, plainly
its evil workings had begun.

&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; exclaimed Tippy, pulling Barbara
to her feet. &ldquo;Keep your head. You&rsquo;ll have
to begin scrubbing that brown paint off your face if
you expect to reach the boat on time.&rdquo;

Automatically Georgina responded to that &ldquo;tut&rdquo;
as if it were the old challenge of the powder horn.
No matter how she shivered she must show what brave
stuff she was made of. Even with that awful foreboding
clutching at her heart like an iron hand and Barby
about to leave her, she mustn&rsquo;t show one sign
of her distress.

It was well that Georgina had learned to move briskly
in her long following after Tippy, else she could
not have been of such service in this emergency. Her
eyes were blurred with tears as she hurried up to the
garret for suitcase and satchel, and down the hall
to look up numbers in the telephone directory. But
it was a comfort even in the midst of her distress
to feel that she could take such an important part
in the preparations, that Tippy trusted her to do
the necessary telephoning, and to put up a lunch for
Barby without dictating either the messages or the
contents of the lunch-box.

When Mr. James Milford called up, immediately after
Richard had raced home with the news, and offered
to take Mrs. Huntingdon to the boat in his machine,
he thought it was Mrs. Huntingdon herself who answered
him. The trembling voice seemed only natural under
the circumstances. He would have smiled could he have
seen the pathetic little face uplifted towards the
receiver, the quivering lip still adorned with the
fierce mustachios of Gory George, in strange contrast
to the soft curls hanging over her shoulders now that
they were no longer hidden by a piratical hat. She
had forgotten that she was in knickerbockers instead
of skirts, and that the old horse-pistol was still
at her belt, until Barbara caught her to her at parting
with a laugh that turned into a sob, looking for a
spot on her face clean enough to kiss.

It was all over so soon--the machine whirling up to
the door and away again to stop at the bank an instant
for the money which Georgina had telephoned to have
waiting, and then on to the railroad wharf where the
_Dorothy Bradford_ had already sounded her
first warning whistle. Georgina had no time to realize
what was actually happening until it was over. She
climbed up into the mammoth willow tree in the corner
of the yard to watch for the steamboat. It would come
into view in a few minutes as it ploughed majestically
through the water towards the lighthouse.

Then desolation fell upon her. She had never realized
until that moment how dear her mother was to her.
Then the thought came to her, suppose it was Barby
who had been hurt in an accident, and she Georgina,
was hurrying to her as Barby was hurrying to grandfather
Shirley, unknowing what awaited her at the journey&rsquo;s
end. For a moment she forgot her own unhappiness at
being left behind, in sympathetic understanding of
her mother&rsquo;s distress. She wasn&rsquo;t going
to think about her part of it she told herself, she
was going to be so brave----

Then her glance fell on the &ldquo;holiday tree.&rdquo;

The holiday tree was a little evergreen of Barby&rsquo;s
christening if not of her planting. For every gala
day in the year it bore strange fruit, no matter what
the season. At Hallowe&rsquo;en it was as gay with
jack-o-lanterns and witches&rsquo; caps as if the
pixies themselves had decorated it. On Washington&rsquo;s
birthday each branch was tipped with a flag and a cherry
tart. On the fourteenth of February it was hung with
valentines, and at Easter she was always sure of finding
a candy rabbit or two perched among its branches and
nests of colored eggs. It seemed to be at its best
at Christmas, but it was when it took its turns at
birthday celebrations that it was most wonderful.
Then it blossomed with little glass lanterns of every
color, glowing like red and green and golden stars.
Last year it had borne a great toy ship with all sails
set, and nine &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; oranges, round,
yellow boxes, each containing a gift, because she was
nine years old. In just two more days she would be
ten, and Barby gone!

At that instant the boat whistle sounded long and
deep, sending its melodious boom across the water.
It seemed to strike some chord in the very center
of her being, and make her feel as if something inside
were sinking down and down and down. The sensation
was sickening. It grew worse as the boat steamed away.
She stood up on a limb to watch it. Smaller and smaller
it seemed, leaving only a long plume of smoke in its
wake as it disappeared around Long Point. Then even
the smoke faded, and a forlorn little figure, strangely
at variance with the fierce pirate suit, she crumpled
up in the crotch of the willow, her face hidden in
her elbow, and began to sob piteously: &ldquo;Oh,
Barby! Barby!&rdquo;



Chapter IX
The Birthday Prism

The Towncrier, passing along the street on an early
morning trip to the bakery, stopped at the door of
the antique shop, for a word with Mrs. Yates, the
lady who kept it. She wanted him to &ldquo;cry&rdquo;
an especial bargain sale of old lamps later in the
week. That is how he happened to be standing in the
front door when the crash came in the rear of the shop,
and it was because he was standing there that the crash
came.

Because Mrs. Yates was talking to him she couldn&rsquo;t
be at the back door when the fish-boy came with the
fish, and nobody being there to take it the instant
he knocked, the boy looked in and threw it down on
the table nearest the door. And because the fish was
left to lie there a moment while Mrs. Yates finished
her conversation, the cat, stretched out on the high
window ledge above the table, decided to have his breakfast
without waiting to be called. He was an enormous cat
by the name of &ldquo;Grandpa,&rdquo; and because
he was old and ponderous, and no longer light on his
feet, when he leaped from the windowsill he came down
clumsily in the middle of the very table _full_
of the old lamps which were set aside for the bargain
sale.

Of course, it was the biggest and fanciest lamp in
the lot that was broken--a tall one with a frosted
glass shade and a row of crystal prisms dangling around
the bowl of it. It toppled over on to a pair of old
brass andirons, smashing into a thousand pieces. Bits
of glass flew in every direction, and &ldquo;Grandpa,&rdquo;
his fur electrified by his fright until he looked
twice his natural size, shot through the door as if
fired from a cannon, and was seen no more that morning.

Naturally, Mrs. Yates hurried to the back of the store
to see what had happened, and Mr. Darcy, following,
picked up from the wreck the only piece of the lamp
not shattered to bits by the fall. It was one of the
prisms, which in some miraculous way had survived the
crash, a beautiful crystal pendant without a single
nick or crack.

He picked it up and rubbed his coat sleeve down each
of its three sides, and when he held it up to the
light it sent a ripple of rainbows dancing across
the shop. He watched them, pleased as a child; and
when Mrs. Yates, loud in her complaints of Grandpa,
came with broom and dustpan to sweep up the litter,
he bargained with her for the prism.

That is how he happened to have an offering for Georgina&rsquo;s
birthday when he reached the house a couple of hours
later, not knowing that it was her birthday. Nobody
had remembered it, Barby being gone.

It seemed to Georgina the forlornest day she had ever
opened her eyes upon. The very fact that it was gloriously
sunny with a delicious summer breeze ruffling the
harbor and sending the white sails scudding along
like wings, made her feel all the more desolate. She
was trying her best to forget what day it was, but
there wasn&rsquo;t much to keep her mind off the subject.
Even opportunities for helping Tippy were taken away,
for Belle had come to stay during Barby&rsquo;s absence,
and she insisted on doing what Georgina otherwise
would have done.

If Barby had been at home there would have been no
piano practice on such a gala occasion as a tenth
birthday. There would have been no time for it in
the program of joyful happenings. But because time
dragged, Georgina went to her scales and five-finger
exercises as usual. With the hour-glass on the piano
beside her, she practised not only her accustomed
time, till the sand had run half through, but until
all but a quarter of it had slipped down. Then she
sauntered listlessly out into the dining-room and
stood by one of the open windows, looking out through
the wire screen into the garden.

On any other day she would have found entertainment
in the kitchen listening to Belle and Mrs. Triplett.
Belle seemed doubly interesting now that she had heard
of the unused wedding dress and the sorrow that would
&ldquo;blight her whole life.&rdquo; But Georgina did
not want anyone to see how bitterly she was disappointed.

Just outside, so close to the window that she could
have reached out and touched it had it not been for
the screen, stood the holiday tree. It had held out
its laden arms to her on so many festal occasions that
Georgina had grown to feel that it took a human interest
in all her celebrations. To see it standing bare now,
like any ordinary tree, made her feel that her last
friend was indifferent. Nobody cared. Nobody was glad
that she was in the world. In spite of all she could
do to check them, two big tears welled up and rolled
down her cheeks; then another and another. She lifted
up the hem of her dress to wipe them away, and as she
did so Uncle Darcy came around the hoase.

He looked in at the open window, then asked: &ldquo;Weather
a bit squally, hey? Better put into port and tie up
till storm&rsquo;s over. Let your Uncle Darcy have
a hand at the helm. Come out here, Barby, and let&rsquo;s
talk it over on the door-step.&rdquo;

There was something so heartening in the cheery voice
that Georgina made one more dab at her eyes with the
hem of her dress skirt, then dropped it and went out
through the screen door to join him on the steps which
led down into the garden. At first she was loath to
confess the cause of her tears. She felt ashamed of
being caught crying simply because no one had remembered
the date. It wasn&rsquo;t that she wanted presents,
she sobbed. It was that she wanted someone to be glad
that she&rsquo;d been born and it was so lonesome
without Barby--

In the midst of her reluctant confession Mr. Darcy
bethought himself of the prism in his pocket.

&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, drawing it out. &ldquo;Take
this and put a rainbow around your troubles. It&rsquo;s
a sort of magic glass. When you look through it, it
shows you things you can&rsquo;t see with your ordinary
eyes. Look what it does to the holiday tree.&rdquo;

There was a long-drawn breath of amazement from Georgina
as she held the prism to her eyes and looked through
it at the tree.

&ldquo;Oh! Oh! It does put a rainbow around every
branch and every little tuft of green needles. It&rsquo;s
even lovelier than the colored lanterns were. Isn&rsquo;t
it wonderful? It puts a rainbow around the whole outdoors.&rdquo;

Her gaze went from the grape arbor to the back garden
gate. Then she jumped up and started around the house,
the old man following, and smiling over each enthusiastic
&ldquo;oh&rdquo; she uttered, as the prism showed her
new beauty at every step. He was pleased to have been
the source of her new pleasure.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like looking into a different world,&rdquo;
she cried, as she reached the kitchen door, and eagerly
turned the prism from one object to another. Mrs.
Triplett was scowling intently over the task of trying
to turn the lid of a glass jar which refused to budge.

&ldquo;Oh, it even puts a rainbow around Tippy&rsquo;s
frown,&rdquo; Georgina cried excitedly. Then she ran
to hold the prism over Belle&rsquo;s eyes.

&ldquo;Look what Uncle Darcy brought me for my birthday.
See how it puts a rainbow around every blessed thing,
even the old black pots and pans!&rdquo;

In showing it to Tippy she discovered a tiny hole
in the end of the prism by which it had been hung
from the lamp, and she ran upstairs to find a piece
of ribbon to run through it. When she came down again,
the prism hanging from her neck by a long pink ribbon,
Uncle Darcy greeted her with a new version of the
Banbury Cross song:

Rings on her fingers and ribbon of rose,
She shall have rainbows wherever she goes.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s even better than having music
wherever you go,&rdquo; answered Georgina, whirling
around on her toes. Then she stopped in a listening
attitude, hearing the postman.

When she came back from the front door with only a
magazine her disappointment was keen, butl she said
bravely:

&ldquo;Of course, I _knew_ there couldn&rsquo;t
be a letter from Barby this soon. She couldn&rsquo;t
get there till last night--but just for a minute I
couldn&rsquo;t help hoping--but I didn&rsquo;t mind
it half so much, Uncle Darcy, when I looked at the
postman through the prism. Even his whiskers were
blue and red and yellow.&rdquo;

That afternoon a little boat went dipping up and down
across the waves. It was _The Betsey_, with
Uncle Darcy pulling at the oars and Georgina as passenger.
Lifting the prism which still hung from her neck by
the pink ribbon, she looked out upon what seemed to
be an enchanted harbor. It was filled with a fleet
of rainbows. Every sail was outlined with one, every
mast edged with lines of red and gold and blue. Even
the gray wharves were tinged with magical color, and
the water itself, to her reverent thought, suggested
the &ldquo;sea of glass mingled with fire,&rdquo; which
is pictured as one of the glories of the New Jerusalem.

&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it _wonderful,_ Uncle
Darcy?&rdquo; she asked in a hushed, awed tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just like a miracle the way this bit of glass changes
the whole world. Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;

Before he could answer, a shrill whistle sounded near
at hand. They were passing the boathouse on the beach
below the Green Stairs. Looking up they saw Richard,
hanging out of the open doors of the loft, waving to
them. Georgina stood up in the boat and beckoned, but
he shook his head, pointing backward with his thumb
into the studio, and disconsolately lately shrugged
his shoulders.

&ldquo;He wants to go _so_ bad!&rdquo; exclaimed
Georgina. &ldquo;Seems as if his father&rsquo;s a
mighty slow painter. Maybe if you&rsquo;d ask him the
way you did before, Uncle Darcy, he&rsquo;d let Richard
off this one more time--being my birthday, you know.&rdquo;

She looked at him with the bewitching smile which
he usually found impossible to resist, but this time
he shook his head.

&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want him along to-day. I&rsquo;ve
brought you out here to show you something and have
a little talk with you alone. Maybe I ought to wait
till you&rsquo;re older before I say what I want to
say, but at my time of life I&rsquo;m liable to slip
off without much warning, and I don&rsquo;t want to
go till I&rsquo;ve said it to you.&rdquo;

Georgina put down her prism to stare at him in eager-eyed
wonder. She was curious to know what he could show
her out here on the water, and what he wanted to tell
her that was as important as his solemn words implied.

&ldquo;Wait till we come to it,&rdquo; he said, answering
the unspoken question in her eyes. And Georgina, who
dearly loved dramatic effects in her own story-telling,
waited for something--she knew not what--to burst upon
her expectant sight.

They followed the line of the beach for some time,
dodging in between motor boats and launches, under
the high railroad wharf and around the smaller ones
where the old fish-houses stood. Past groups of children,
playing in the sand they went, past artists sketching
under their white umbrellas, past gardens gay with
bright masses of color, past drying nets spread out
on the shore.

Presently Uncle Darcy stopped rowing and pointed across
a vacant strip of beach between two houses, to one
on the opposite side of the street.

&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I wanted to show you.&rdquo;

Georgina followed the direction of his pointing finger.

&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; she said in a disappointed
tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that all my life. It&rsquo;s
nothing but the Figurehead House.&rdquo;

She was looking at a large white house with a portico
over the front door, on the roof of which portico
was perched half of the wooden figure of a woman.
It was of heroic size, head thrown back as if looking
off to sea, and with a green wreath in its hands.
Weather-beaten and discolored, it was not an imposing
object at first glance, and many a jibe and laugh
it had called forth from passing tourists.

Georgina&rsquo;s disappointment showed in her face.

&ldquo;I know all about that,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;Mrs. Tupman told me herself. She calls it the
Lady of Mystery. She said that years and years ago
a schooner put out from this town on a whaling cruise,
and was gone more than a year. When it was crossing
the equator, headed for home, the look-out at the
masthead saw a strange object in the water that looked
like a woman afloat. The Captain gave orders to lower
the boats, and when they did so they found this figurehead.
She said it must have come from the prow of some great
clipper in the East India trade. They were in the
Indian Ocean, you know.

&ldquo;There had been some frightful storms and afterwards
they heard of many wrecks. This figurehead was so
long they had to cut it in two to get it into the
hold of the vessel. They brought it home and set it
up there over the front door, and they call it the
Lady of Mystery, because they said &rsquo;from whence
that ship came, what was its fate and what was its
destination will always be shrouded in mystery.&rsquo;
And Mrs. Tupman said that a famous artist looked at
it once and said it was probably the work of a Spanish
artist, and that from the pose of its head and the
wreath in its hands he was sure it was intended to
represent Hope. Was _that_ what you were
going to tell me?&rdquo;

The old man had rested on his oars while she hurried
through this tale, with a mischievous twinkle in her
eyes, as if she thought she was forestalling him.
Now he picked them up again and began rowing out into
the harbor.

&ldquo;That was a part of it,&rdquo; he admitted,
&ldquo;but that&rsquo;s only the part that the whole
town knows. That old figurehead has a meaning for me
that nobody else that&rsquo;s living knows about.
That&rsquo;s what I want to pass on to you.&rdquo;

He rowed several minutes more before he said slowly,
with a wistful tenderness coming into his dim old
eyes as he looked at her:

&ldquo;Georgina, I don&rsquo;t suppose anybody&rsquo;s
ever told you about the troubles I&rsquo;ve had. They
wouldn&rsquo;t talk about such things to a child like
you. Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t, now; but when I saw
how disappointed you were this morning, I said to
myself, &rsquo;If she&rsquo;s old enough to feel trouble
that way, she&rsquo;s old enough to understand and
to be helped by hearing about mine.&rsquo;&rdquo;

It seemed hard for him to go on, for again he paused,
looking off toward the lighthouse in the distance.
Then he said slowly, in a voice that shook at times:

&ldquo;Once--I had a boy--that I set all my hopes
on--just as a man puts all his cargo into one vessel;
and nobody was ever prouder than I was, when that
little craft went sailing along with the best of them.
I used to look at him and think, _&rsquo;Danny&rsquo;ll_
weather the seas no matter how rough they are, and
he&rsquo;ll bring up in the harbor I&rsquo;m hoping
he&rsquo;ll reach, with all flags flying.&rsquo; And
then--something went wrong--&rdquo;

The tremulous voice broke. &ldquo;My little ship went
down--all my precious cargo lost--&rdquo;

Another and a longer pause. In it Georgina seemed
to hear Cousin Mehitable&rsquo;s husky voice, half
whispering:

_"And the lamp threw a shadow on the yellow blind,
plain as a photograph. The shadow of an old man sitting
with his arms flung out across the table and his head
bowed on-them. And he was groaning, &rsquo;Oh, my
Danny! My Danny! If you could only have gone that way.&rsquo;"_

For a moment Georgina felt the cruel hurt of his grief
as if the pain had stabbed her own heart. The old
man went on:

&ldquo;If it had only been any other kind of a load,
anything but _disgrace_, I could have carried
it without flinching. But that, it seemed I just couldn&rsquo;t
face. Only the good Lord knows how I lived through
those first few weeks. Then your grandfather Huntingdon
came to me. He was always a good friend. And he asked
me to row him out here on the water. When we passed
the Figurehead House he pointed up at that head. It
was all white and fair in those days, before the paint
wore off. And he said, &rsquo;Dan&rsquo;l Darcy, _as
long as a man keeps Hope at the prow he keeps afloat_.
As soon as he drops it he goes to pieces and down to
the bottom, the way that ship did when it lost its
figurehead. You mustn&rsquo;t let go, Dan&rsquo;l.
You _must_ keep Hope at the prow.

&ldquo;&rsquo;Somewhere in God&rsquo;s universe either
in this world or another your boy is alive and still
your son. You&rsquo;ve got to go on hoping that if
he&rsquo;s innocent his name will be cleared of this
disgrace, and if he&rsquo;s guilty he&rsquo;ll wipe
out the old score against him some way and make good.&rsquo;

&ldquo;And then he gave me a line to live by. A line
he said that had been written by a man who was stone
blind, and hadn&rsquo;t anything to look forward to
all the rest of his life but groping in the dark. He
said he&rsquo;d not

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;Bate a jot
Of heart or hope, but still bear up and steer
Right onward.&rsquo;

&ldquo;At first it didn&rsquo;t seem to mean anything
to me, but he made me say it after him as if it were
a sort of promise, and I&rsquo;ve been saying it every
day of every year since then. I&rsquo;d said it to
myself first, when I met people on the street that
I knew were thinking of Danny&rsquo;s disgrace, and
I didn&rsquo;t see how I was going to get up courage
to pass &rsquo;em. And I said it when I was lying
on my bed at night with my heart so sore and heavy
I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, and after a while it did begin
to put courage into me, so that I could hope in earnest.
And when I did _that,_ little lass--&rdquo;

He leaned over to smile into her eyes, now full of
tears, he had so wrought upon her tender sympathies--

&ldquo;When I did that, it put a rainbow around my
trouble just as that prism did around your empty holiday
tree. It changed the looks of the whole world for
me.

&ldquo;_That&rsquo;s_ what I brought you
out here to tell you, Georgina. I want to give you
the same thing that your grandfather Huntingdon gave
me--that line to live by. Because troubles come to
everybody. They&rsquo;ll come to you, too, but I want
you to know this, Baby, they can&rsquo;t hurt you as
long as you keep Hope at the prow, because Hope is
a magic glass that makes rainbows of our tears. Now
you won&rsquo;t forget that, will you? Even after
Uncle Darcy is dead and gone, you&rsquo;ll remember
that he brought you out here on your birthday to give
you that good word--_&rsquo;still bear up and
steer right onward,&rsquo;_ no matter what happens.
And to tell you that in all the long, hard years he&rsquo;s
lived through, he&rsquo;s proved it was good.&rdquo;

Georgina, awed and touched of soul, could only nod
her assent. But because Childhood sometimes has no
answer to make to the confidences of Age is no reason
that they are not taken to heart and stowed away there
for the years to build upon. In the unbroken silence
with which they rowed back to shore, Georgina might
have claimed three score years besides her own ten,
so perfect was the feeling of comradeship between
them.

As they passed the pier back of the antique shop,
a great gray cat rose and stretched itself, then walked
ponderously down to the water&rsquo;s edge. It was
&ldquo;Grandpa.&rdquo; Georgina, laughing a little
shakily because of recent tears, raised her prism
to put a rainbow around the cat&rsquo;s tail, unknowing
that but for him the crystal pendant would now be hanging
from an antique lamp instead of from the ribbon around
her neck.



Chapter X
Moving Pictures

It often happens that when one is all primed and cocked
for trouble, that trouble flaps its wings and flies
away for a time, leaving nothing to fire at. So Georgina,
going home with her prism and her &ldquo;line to live
by,&rdquo; ready and eager to prove how bravely she
could meet disappointments, found only pleasant surprises
awaiting her.

Mrs. Triplett had made a birthday cake in her absence.
It was on the supper table with ten red candles atop.
And there was a note from Barby beside her plate which
had come in the last mail. It had been posted at some
way-station. There was a check inside for a dollar
which she was to spend as she pleased. A dear little
note it was, which made Georgina&rsquo;s throat ache
even while it brought a glow to her heart. Then Belle,
who had not known it was her birthday in time to make
her a present, announced that she would take her to
a moving picture show after supper, instead.

Georgina had frequently been taken to afternoon performances,
but never at night. It was an adventure in itself
just to be down in the part of town where the shops
were, when they were all lighted, and when the summer
people were surging along the board-walk and out into
the middle of the narrow street in such crowds that
the automobiles and &ldquo;accommodations&rdquo; had
to push their way through slowly, with a great honking
of warning horns.

The Town Hall was lighted for a dance when they passed
it. The windows of the little souvenir shops seemed
twice as attractive as when seen by day, and early
as it was in the evening, people were already lined
up in the drug-store, three deep around the soda-water
fountain.

Georgina, thankful that Tippy had allowed her to wear
her gold locket for the occasion, walked down the
aisle and took her seat near the stage, feeling as
conspicuous and self-conscious as any debutante entering
a box at Grand Opera.

It was a hot night, but on a line with the front seats,
there was a double side door opening out onto a dock.
From where Georgina sat she could look out through
the door and see the lights of a hundred boats twinkling
in long wavy lines across the black water, and now
and then a salt breeze with the fishy tang she loved,
stole across the room and touched her cheek like a
cool finger.

The play was not one which Barbara would have chosen
for Georgina to see, being one that was advertised
as a thriller. It was full of hair-breadth escapes
and tragic scenes. There was a shipwreck in it, and
passengers were brought ashore in the breeches buoy,
just as she had seen sailors brought in on practice
days over at the Race Point Lifesaving station. And
there was a still form stretched out stark and dripping
under a piece of tarpaulin, and a girl with long fair
hair streaming wildly over her shoulders knelt beside
it wringing her hands.

Georgina stole a quick side-glance at Belle. That
was the way it had been in the story of Emmett Potter&rsquo;s
drowning, as they told it on the day of Cousin Mehitable&rsquo;s
visit. Belle&rsquo;s hands were locked together in
her lap, and her lips were pressed in a thin line
as if she were trying to keep from saying something.
Several times in the semi-darkness of the house her
handkerchief went furtively to her eyes.

Georgina&rsquo;s heart beat faster. Somehow, with
the piano pounding out that deep tum-tum, like waves
booming up on the rocks, she began to feel strangely
confused, as if _she_ were the heroine on
the films; as if _she_ were kneeling there
on the shore in that tragic moment of parting from
her dead lover. She was sure that she knew exactly
how Belle felt then, how she was feeling now.

When the lights were switched on again and they rose
to go out, Georgina was so deeply under the spell
of the play that it gave her a little shock of surprise
when Belle began talking quite cheerfully and in her
ordinary manner to her next neighbor. She even laughed
in response to some joking remark as they edged their
way slowly up the aisle to the door. It seemed to
Georgina that if she had lived through a scene like
the one they had just witnessed, she could never smile
again. On the way out she glanced up again at Belie
several times, wondering.

Going home the street was even more crowded than it
had been coming. They could barely push their way
along, and were bumped into constantly by people dodging
back to escape the jam when the crowd had to part to
let a vehicle through. But after a few blocks of such
jostling the going was easier. The drug-store absorbed
part of the throng, and most of the procession turned
up Carver Street to the Gifford House and the cottages
beyond on Bradford Street.

By the time Georgina and Belle came to the last half-mile
of the plank walk, scarcely a footstep sounded behind
them. After passing the Green Stairs there was an
unobstructed view of the harbor. A full moon was high
overhead, flooding the water and beach with such a
witchery of light that Georgina moved along as if
she were in a dream--in a silver dream beside a silver
sea.

Belle pointed to a little pavilion in sight of the
breakwater. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over there and sit
down a few minutes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a waste of good material to go indoors on a night
like this.&rdquo;

They crossed over, sinking in the sand as they stepped
from the road to the beach, till Georgina had to take
off her slippers and shake them before she could settle
down comfortably on the bench in the pavilion. They
sat there a while without speaking, just as they had
sat before the pictures on the films, for never on
any film was ever shown a scene of such entrancing
loveliness as the one spread out before them. In the
broad path made by the moon hung ghostly sails, rose
great masts, twinkled myriads of lights. It was so
still they could hear the swish of the tide creeping
up below, the dip of near-by oars and the chug of a
motor boat, far away down by the railroad wharf.

Then Belle began to talk. She looked straight out
across the shining path of the moon and spoke as if
she were by herself. She did not look at Georgina,
sitting there beside her. Perhaps if she had, she would
have realized that her listener was only a child and
would not have said all she did. Or maybe, something
within her felt the influence of the night, the magical
drawing of the moon as the tide feels it, and she could
not hold back the long-repressed speech that rose
to her lips. Maybe it was that the play they had seen,
quickened old memories into painful life again.

It was on a night just like this, she told Georgina,
that Emmett first told her that he cared for her--ten
years ago this summer. Ten years! The whole of Georgina&rsquo;s
little lifetime! And now Belle was twenty-seven. Twenty-seven
seemed very old to Georgina. She stole another upward
glance at her companion. Belle did not look old, sitting
there in her white dress, like a white moonflower
in that silver radiance, a little lock of soft blonde
hair fluttering across her cheek.

In a rush of broken sentences with long pauses between
which somehow told almost as much as words, Belle
recalled some of the scenes of that summer, and Georgina,
who up to this night had only glimpsed the dim outlines
of romance, as a child of ten would glimpse them through
old books, suddenly saw it face to face, and thereafter
found it something to wonder about and dream sweet,
vague dreams over.

Suddenly Belle stood up with a complete change of
manner.

&ldquo;My! it must be getting late,&rdquo; she said
briskly. &ldquo;Aunt Maria will scold if I keep you
out any longer.&rdquo;

Going home, she was like the Belle whom Georgina had
always known--so different from the one lifting the
veil of memories for the little while they sat in
the pavilion.

Georgina had thought that with no Barby to &ldquo;button
her eyes shut with a kiss&rdquo; at the end of her
birthday, the going-to-sleep time would be sad. But
she was so busy recalling the events of the day that
she never thought of the omitted ceremony. For a long
time she lay awake, imagining all sorts of beautiful
scenes in which she was the heroine.

First, she went back to what Uncle Darcy had told
her, and imagined herself as rescuing an only child
who was drowning. The whole town stood by and cheered
when she came up with it, dripping, and the mother
took her in her arms and said, _"You_ are
our prism, Georgina Huntingdon! But for your noble
act our lives would be, indeed, desolate. It is you
who have filled them with rainbows.&rdquo;

Then she was in a ship crossing the ocean, and a poor
sailor hearing her speak of Cape Cod would come and
ask her to tell him of its people, and she would find
he was Danny. She would be the means of restoring him
to his parents.

And then, she and Richard on some of their treasure-hunting
expeditions which they were still planning every time
they met, would unearth a casket some dark night by
the light of a fitful lantern, and inside would be
a confession written by the man who had really stolen
the money, saying that Dan Darcy was innocent. And
Uncle Darcy and Aunt Elspeth would be so heavenly
glad--The tears came to Georgina&rsquo;s eyes as she
pictured the scene in the little house in Fishburn
Court, it came to her so vividly.

The clock downstairs struck twelve, but still she
went on with the pleasing pictures moving through
her mind as they had moved across the films earlier
in the evening. The last one was a combination of what
she had seen there and what Belle had told her.

She was sitting beside a silver sea across which a
silver moon was making a wonderful shining path of
silver ripples, and somebody was telling her-- what
Emmett had told Belle ten years ago. And she knew past
all doubting that if that shadowy somebody beside
her should die, she would carry the memory of him
to her grave as Belle was doing. It seemed such a sweet,
sad way to live that she thought it would be more interesting
to have her life like that, than to have it go along
like the lives of all the married people of her acquaintance.
And if _he_ had a father like Emmett&rsquo;s
father she would cling to him as Belle did, and go
to see him often and take the part of a real daughter
to him. But she wouldn&rsquo;t want him to be like
Belle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Father Potter.&rdquo; He was an
old fisherman, too crippled to follow the sea any
longer, so now he was just a mender of nets, sitting
all day knotting twine with dirty tar-blackened fingers.

The next morning when she went downstairs it was Belle
and not Mrs. Triplett who was stepping about the kitchen
in a big gingham apron, preparing breakfast. Mrs.
Triplett was still in bed. Such a thing had never
happened before within Georgina&rsquo;s recollection.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rheumatism in her back,&rdquo;
Belle reported. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so bad she can&rsquo;t
lie still with any comfort, and she can&rsquo;t move
without groaning. So she&rsquo;s sort of &lsquo;between
the de&rsquo;il and the deep sea.&rsquo; And touchy
is no name for it. She doesn&rsquo;t like it if you
don&rsquo;t and she doesn&rsquo;t like it if you do;
but you can&rsquo;t wonder when the pain&rsquo;s so
bad. It&rsquo;s pretty near lumbago.&rdquo;

Georgina, who had finished her dressing by tying the
prism around her neck, was still burning with the
desire which Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s talk had kindled
within her, to be a little comfort to everybody.

&ldquo;Let me take her toast and tea up to her,&rdquo;
she begged. With that toast and tea she intended to
pass along the good word Uncle Darcy had given her--&ldquo;the
line to live by.&rdquo; But Tippy was in no humor to
be adjured by a chit of a child to bear up and steer
right onward. Such advice would have been coldly received
just then even from her minister.

&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking
about,&rdquo; she exclaimed testily. &ldquo;Bear up?
Of course I&rsquo;ll bear up. There&rsquo;s nothing
else _to_ do with rheumatism, but you needn&rsquo;t
come around with any talk of putting rainbows around
it or me either.&rdquo;

She gave her pillow an impatient thump with her hard
knuckles.

&ldquo;Deliver me from people who make it their business
in life always to act cheerful no matter _what._
The Scripture itself says &rsquo;There&rsquo;s a time
to laugh and a time to weep, a time to mourn and a
time to dance.&rsquo; When the weeping time comes
I can&rsquo;t abide either people or books that go
around spreading cheerful sayings on everybody like
salve!&rdquo;

Tippy, lying there with her hair screwed into a tight
little button on the top of her head, looked strangely
unlike herself. Georgina descended to the kitchen,
much offended. It hurt her feelings to have her good
offices spurned in such a way. She didn&rsquo;t care
how bad anybody&rsquo;s rheumatism was she muttured.
&ldquo;It was no excuse for saying such nasty things
to people who were trying to be kind to them.&rdquo;

Belle suggested presently that the customary piano
practice be omitted that morning for fear it might
disturb Aunt Maria, so when the usual little tasks
were done Georgina would have found time dragging,
had it not been for the night letter which a messenger
boy brought soon after breakfast. Grandfather Shirley
was better than she had expected to find him, Barby
wired. Particulars would follow soon in a letter. It
cheered Georgina up so much that she took a pencil
and tablet of paper up into the willow tree and wrote
a long account to her mother of the birthday happenings.
What with the red-candled cake and the picture show
and the afternoon in the boat it sounded as if she
had had a very happy day. But mostly she wrote about
the prism, and what Uncle Darcy had told her about
the magic glass of Hope. When it was done she went
in to Belle.

&ldquo;May I go down to the post-office to mail this
and stop on my way back at the Green Stairs and see
if Richard can come and play with me?&rdquo; she asked.

Belle considered. &ldquo;Better stay down at the Milford&rsquo;s
to do your playing,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It
might bother Aunt Maria to have a boy romping around
here.&rdquo;

So Georgina fared forth, after taking off her prism
and hanging it in a safe place. Only Captain Kidd
frisked down to meet her when she stood under the
studio window and gave the alley yodel which Richard
had taught her. There was no answer. She repeated
it several times, and then Mr. Moreland appeared at
the window, in his artist&rsquo;s smock with a palette
on his thumb and a decidedly impatient expression
on his handsome face. Richard was posing, he told
her, and couldn&rsquo;t leave for half an hour. His
tone was impatient, too, for he had just gotten a good
start after many interruptions.

Undecided whether to go back home or sit down on the
sand and wait, Georgina stood looking idly about her.
And while she hesitated, Manuel and Joseph and Rosa
came straggling along the beach in search of adventure.

It came to Georgina like an inspiration that it wasn&rsquo;t
Barby who had forbidden her to play with them, it
was Tippy. And with a vague feeling that she was justified
in disobeying her because of her recent crossness,
she rounded them up for a chase over the granite slabs
of the breakwater. If they would be Indians, she proposed,
she&rsquo;d be the Deerslayer, like the hero of the
Leather-Stocking Tales, and chase &rsquo;em with a
gun.

They had never heard of those tales, but they were
more than willing to undertake any game which Georgina
might propose. So after a little coaching in war-whoops,
with a battered tin pan for a tom-tom, three impromptu
Indians sped down the beach under the studio windows,
pursued by a swift-footed Deerslayer with flying curls.
The end of a broken oar was her musket, which she
brandished fiercely as she echoed their yells.

Mr. Moreland gave a groan of despair as he looked
at his model when those war-whoops broke loose. Richard,
who had succeeded after many trials in lapsing into
the dreamy attitude which his father wanted, started
up at the first whoop, so alert and interested that
his nostrils quivered. He scented excitement of some
kind and was so eager to be in the midst of it that
the noise of the tom-tom made him wriggle in his chair.

He looked at his father appealingly, then made an
effort to settle down into his former attitude. His
body assumed the same listless pose as before, but
his eyes were so eager and shining with interest that
they fairly spoke each time the rattly drumming on
the tin pan sounded a challenge.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Dicky,&rdquo; said his father
at last. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up with us for this
time. You might as well go on. But I wish that little
tom-boy had stayed at home.&rdquo;

And Richard went, with a yell and a hand-spring, to
throw in his lot with Manuel and Joseph and be chased
by the doughty Deer-slayer and her hound. In the readjustment
of parts Rosa was told to answer to the name of Hector.
It was all one to Rosa whether she was hound or redskin,
so long as she was allowed a part in the thrilling
new game. Richard had the promise of being Deer-slayer
next time they played it.



Chapter XI
The Old Rifle Gives Up Its Secret

Out of that game with forbidden playmates, grew events
which changed the lives of several people. It began
by Richard&rsquo;s deciding that a real gun was necessary
for his equipment if he was to play the part of Leather-Stocking
properly. Also, he argued, it would be a valuable addition
to their stock of fire-arms. The broken old horse-pistols
were good enough to play at pirating with, but something
which would really shoot was needed when they started
out in earnest on a sure-enough adventure.

Georgina suggested that he go to Fishburn Court and
borrow a rifle that she had seen up in Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s
attic. She would go with him and do the asking, she
added, but Belle had promised to take her with her
the next time she went to see the net-mender, and
the next time would be the following afternoon, if
Tippy was well enough to be up and around. Georgina
couldn&rsquo;t miss the chance to see inside the cottage
that had been the home of a hero and Belle&rsquo;s
drowned lover. She wanted to see the newspaper which
Mr. Potter showed everybody who went to the house.
It had an account of the wreck and the rescue in it,
with Emmett&rsquo;s picture on the front page, and
black headlines under it that said, &ldquo;Died like
a hero.&rdquo;

Tippy was well enough to be up next day, so Richard
went alone to Fishburn Court, and Georgina trudged
along the sandy road with Belle to the weather-beaten
cottage on the edge of the cranberry bog. Belle told
her more about the old man as they walked along.

&ldquo;Seems as if he just lives on that memory. He
can&rsquo;t get out in the boats any more, being so
crippled up, and he can&rsquo;t see to read much, so
there&rsquo;s lots of time for him to sit and think
on the past. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the nets he&rsquo;d
about lose his mind. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it out, and
you needn&rsquo;t repeat it, but sometimes I think
it&rsquo;s already touched a mite. You see the two
of them lived there together so long alone, that Emmett
was all in all to his father. I suppose that&rsquo;s
why Emmett is all he can talk about now.&rdquo;

When they reached the cottage Mr. Potter was sitting
out in front as usual, busy with his work. Georgina
was glad that he did not offer to shake hands. His
were so dirty and black with tar she felt she could
not bear to touch them. He was a swarthy old man with
skin like wrinkled leather, and a bushy, grizzled
beard which grew up nearly to his eyes. Again Georgina
wondered, looking at Belle in her crisp, white dress
and white shoes. How could she care for this unkempt
old creature enough to call him Father?

As she followed Belle around inside the dreary three-room
cottage she wanted to ask if this would have been
her home if Emmett had not been drowned, but she felt
a delicacy about asking such a question. She couldn&rsquo;t
imagine Belle in such a setting, but after she had
followed her around a while longer she realized that
the house wouldn&rsquo;t stay dreary with such a mistress.
In almost no time the place was put to rights, and
there was a pan of cookies ready to slip into the oven.

When the smell of their browning stole out to the
front door the old man left his bench and came in
to get a handful of the hot cakes. Then, just as Belle
said he would, he told Georgina all that had happened
the night of the wreck.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very chair he was sittin&rsquo;
in, when Luke Jones come in with the word that men
were needed. He started right off with Luke soon as
he could get into his oil-skins, for &lsquo;twas stormin&rsquo;
to beat the band. But he didn&rsquo;t go fur. Almost
no time it seemed like, he was comin&rsquo; into the
house agin, and he went into that bedroom there, and
shet the door behind him. That of itself ought to
&rsquo;uv made me know something out of the usual
was beginnin&rsquo; to happen, for he never done such
a thing before. A few minutes later he came out with
an old rifle that him and Dan Darcy used to carry
around in the dunes for target shootin&rsquo; and he
set it right down in that corner by the chimney jamb.

&ldquo;&lsquo;First time anybody passes this way goin&rsquo;
down ito Fishburn Court,&rsquo; he says, &rsquo;I
wish you&rsquo;d send this along to Uncle Dan&rsquo;l.
It&rsquo;s his by rights, and he&rsquo;d ought a had
it long ago.&rsquo;

&ldquo;An&rsquo; them was his last words to me, except
as he pulled the door to after him he called &lsquo;Good-bye
Pop, if I don&rsquo;t see you agin.&rsquo;

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when he&rsquo;d done such
a thing before as to say good-bye when he went out,
and I&rsquo;ve often wondered over it sence, could
he &rsquo;a had any warnin&rsquo; that something was
goin&rsquo; to happen to him?&rdquo;

Georgina gazed at the picture in the newspaper long
and curiously. It had been copied from a faded tin-type,
but even making allowances for that Emmett didn&rsquo;t
look as she imagined a hero should, nor did it seem
possible it could be the man Belle had talked about.
She wished she hadn&rsquo;t seen it. It dimmed the
glamor of romance which seemed to surround him like
a halo. Hearing about him in the magical moonlight
she had pictured him as looking as Sir Galahad. But
if _this_ was what he really looked like--Again
she glanced wonderingly at Belle. How could she care
so hard for ten long years for just an ordinary man
like that?

When it was time to go home Belle suggested that they
walk around by Fishburn Court. It would be out of
their way, but she had heard that Aunt Elspeth wasn&rsquo;t
as well as usual.

&ldquo;Emmett always called her Aunt,&rdquo; she explained
to Georgina as they walked along, &ldquo;so I got
into the way of doing it, too. He was so fond of Dan&rsquo;s
mother. She was so good to him after his own went that
I feel I want to be nice to her whenever I can, for
his sake.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;Aunt
Elspeth never would give up but that Dan was innocent,
and since her memory&rsquo;s been failing her this
last year, she talks all the time about his coming
home; just lies there in bed half her time and babbles
about him. It almost kills Uncle Dan&rsquo;l to hear
her, because, of course, he knows the truth of the
matter, that Dan _was_ guilty. He as good
as confessed it before he ran away, and the running
away itself told the story.&rdquo;

When they reached Fishburn Court they could see two
people sitting in front of the cottage. Uncle Darcy
was in an armchair on the grass with one of the cats
in his lap, and Richard sat on one seat of the red,
wooden swing with Captain Kidd on the opposite site
one. Richard had a rifle across his knees, the one
Georgina had suggested borrowing. He passed his hand
caressingly along its stock now and then, and at intervals
raised it to sight along the barrel. It was so heavy
he could not keep it from wobbling when he raised
it to take aim in various directions.

At the click of the gate-latch the old man tumbled
Yellownose out of his lap and rose stiffly to welcome
his guests.

&ldquo;Come right in,&rdquo; he said cordially. &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;ll
be glad to see you, Belle. She&rsquo;s been sort of
low in her mind lately, and needs cheering up.&rdquo;

He led the way into a low-ceilinged, inner bedroom
with the shades all pulled down. It was so dark, compared
to the glaring road they had been following, that
Georgina blinked at the dim interior. She could scarcely
make out the figure on the high-posted bed, and drew
back, whispering to Belle that she&rsquo;d stay outside
until they were ready to go home. Leaving them on
the threshold, she went back to the shady door-yard
to a seat in the swing beside Captain Kidd.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s
rifle,&rdquo; explained Richard. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
been telling me about him. Feel how smooth the stock
is.&rdquo;

Georgina reached over and passed her hand lightly
along the polished wood.

&ldquo;He and a friend of his called Emmett Potter
used to carry it on the dunes sometimes to shoot at
a mark with. It wasn&rsquo;t good for much else, it&rsquo;s
so old. Dan got it in a trade once; traded a whole
litter of collie pups for it. Uncle Darcy says he&rsquo;d
forgotten there was such a gun till somebody brought
it to him after Emmett was drowned.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; interrupted Georgina, her eyes wide
with interest. &ldquo;Emmett&rsquo;s father has just
been telling me about this very rifle. But I didn&rsquo;t
dream it was the one I&rsquo;d seen up in the attic
here. He showed me the corner where Emmett stood it
when he left for the wreck, and told what was to be
done with it. &lsquo;Them were his last words,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she added, quoting Mr. Potter.

She reached out her hand for the clumsy old firearm
and almost dropped it, finding it so much heavier
than she expected. She wanted to touch with her own
fingers the weapon that had such an interesting history,
and about which a hero had spoken his last words.

&ldquo;The hammer&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; continued
Richard. &ldquo;Whoever brought it home let it fall.
It&rsquo;s all rusty, too, because it was up in the
attic so many years and the roof leaked on it. But
Uncle Darcy said lots of museums would be glad to
have it because there aren&rsquo;t many of these old
flint-locks left now. He&rsquo;s going to leave it
to the Pilgrim museum up by the monument when he&rsquo;s
dead and gone, but he wants to keep it as long as he
lives because Danny set such store by it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some numbers or letters or something
on it,&rdquo; announced Georgina, peering at a small
brass plate on the stock. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make
them out. I tell you what let&rsquo;s do,&rdquo; she
exclaimed in a burst of enthusiasm. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
polish it up so&rsquo;s we can read them. Tippy uses
vinegar and wood ashes for brass. I&rsquo;ll run get
some.&rdquo;

Georgina was enough at home here to find what she
wanted without asking, and as full of resources as
Robinson Crusoe. She was back in a very few minutes
with a shovel full of ashes from the kitchen stove,
and an old can lid full of vinegar, drawn from a jug
in the corner cupboard. With a scrap of a rag dipped
first in vinegar, then in ashes, she began scrubbing
the brass plate diligently. It had corroded until there
was an edge of green entirely around it.

&ldquo;I love to take an old thing like this and scrub
it till it shines like gold,&rdquo; she said, scouring
away with such evident enjoyment of the job that Richard
insisted on having a turn. She surrendered the rag
grudgingly, but continued to direct operations.

&ldquo;Now dip it in the ashes again. No, not that
way, double the rag up and use more vinegar. Rub around
that other corner a while. Here, let me show you.&rdquo;

She took the rifle away from him again and proceeded
to illustrate her advice. Suddenly she looked up,
startled.

&ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;ve rubbed it loose. It moved
a little to one side. See?&rdquo;

He grabbed it back and examined it closely. &ldquo;I
bet it&rsquo;s meant to move,&rdquo; he said finally.
&ldquo;It looks like a lid, see! It slides sideways.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, I remember now,&rdquo; she cried, much
excited. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way Leather-Stocking&rsquo;s
rifle was made. There was a hole in the stock with
a brass plate over it, and he kept little pieces of
oiled deer-skin inside of it to wrap bullets in before
he loaded &rsquo;em in. I remember just as plain, the
place in the story where he stopped to open it and
take out a piece of oiled deer-skin when he started
to load.&rdquo;

As she explained she snatched the rifle back into
her own hands once more, and pried at the brass plate
until she broke the edge of her thumb nail. Then Richard
took it, and with the aid of a rusty button-hook which
he happened to have in his pocket, having found it
on the street that morning, he pushed the plate entirely
back.

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something white inside!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. Instantly two heads bent over with his
in an attempt to see, for Captain Kidd&rsquo;s shaggy
hair was side by side with Georgina&rsquo;s curls,
his niriosity as great as hers.

&ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s in there has been there an
awful long time,&rdquo; said Richard as he poked at
the contents with his button-hook, &ldquo;for Uncle
Darcy said the rifle&rsquo;s never been used since
it was brought back to him.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s ten years come Michaelmas since
Emmett was drowned,&rdquo; said Georgina, again quoting
the old net-mender.

The piece of paper which they finally succeeded in
drawing out had been folded many times and crumpled
into a flat wad. Evidently the message on it had been
scrawled hastily in pencil by someone little used to
letter writing. It was written in an odd hand, and
the united efforts of the two little readers could
decipher only parts of it.

&ldquo;I can read any kind of plain writing like they
do in school,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;but not
this sharp-cornered kind where the m&rsquo;s and u&rsquo;s
are alike, and all the tails are pointed.&rdquo;

Slowly they puzzled out parts of it, halting long
over some of the undecipherable words, but a few words
here and there were all they could recognize. There
were long stretches that had no meaning whatever for
them. This much, however, they managed to spell out:

&ldquo;Dan never took the money.... I did it.... He
went away because he knew I did it and wouldn&rsquo;t
tell.... Sorry.... Can&rsquo;t stand it any longer....
Put an end to it all....&rdquo;

It was signed &ldquo;Emmett Potter.&rdquo;

The two children looked at each other with puzzled
eyes until into Georgina&rsquo;s came a sudden and
startled understanding. Snatching up the paper she
almost fell out of the swing and ran towards the house
screaming:

&ldquo;Uncle Darcy! Uncle Darcy! Look what we&rsquo;ve
found.&rdquo;

She tripped over a piece of loose carpet spread just
inside the front door as a rug and fell full length,
but too excited to know that she had skinned her elbow
she scrambled up, still calling:

&ldquo;Uncle Darcy, _Dan never took the money.
It was Emmett Potter. He said so himself!"_



Chapter XII
A Hard Promise

A dozen times in Georgina&rsquo;s day-dreaming she
had imagined this scene. She had run to Uncle Darcy
with the proof of Dan&rsquo;s innocence, heard his
glad cry, seen his face fairly transfigured as he
read the confession aloud. Now it was actually happening
before her very eyes, but where was the scene of heavenly
gladness that should have followed?

Belle, startled even more than he by Georgina&rsquo;s
outcry, and quicker to act, read the message over
his shoulder, recognized the handwriting and grasped
the full significance of the situation before he reached
the name at the end. For ten years three little notes
in that same peculiar hand had lain in her box of
keepsakes. There was no mistaking that signature.
She had read it and cried over it so many times that
now as it suddenly confronted her with its familiar
twists and angles it was as startling as if Emmett&rsquo;s
voice had called to her.

As Uncle Darcy looked up from the second reading,
with a faltering exclamation of thanksgiving, she
snatched the paper from his shaking hands and tore
it in two. Then crumpling the pieces and flinging them
from her, she seized him by the wrists.

&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re _not_ going to tell
the whole world,&rdquo; she cried wildly, answering
the announcement he made with the tears raining down
his cheeks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to tell
anybody! Think of me! Think of Father Potter!&rdquo;

She almost screamed her demand. He could hardly believe
it was Belle, this frenzied girl, who, heretofore,
had seemed the gentlest of souls. He looked at her
in a dazed way, so overwhelmed by the discovery that
had just been made, that he failed to comprehend the
reason for her white face and agonized eyes, till
she threw up her arms crying:

_"Emmett_ a thief! God in heaven! It&rsquo;ll
kill me!&rdquo;

It was the sight of Georgina&rsquo;s shocked face
with Richard&rsquo;s at the door, that made things
clear to the old man. He waved them away, with hands
which shook as if he had the palsy.

&ldquo;Go on out, children, for a little while,&rdquo;
he said gently, and closed the door in their faces.

Slowly they retreated to the swing, Georgina clasping
the skinned elbow which had begun to smart. She climbed
into one seat of the swing and Richard and Captain
Kidd took the other. As they swung back and forth she
demanded in a whisper:

&ldquo;Why is it that grown people always shut children
out of their secrets? Seems as if we have a right
to know what&rsquo;s the matter when _we_
found the paper.&rdquo;

Richard made no answer, for just then the sound of
Belle&rsquo;s crying came out to them. The windows
of the cottage were all open and the grass plot between
the windows and the swing being a narrow one the closed
door was of little avail. It was very still there
in the shady dooryard, so still that they could hear
old Yellownose purr, asleep on the cushion in the
wooden arm-chair beside the swing. The broken sentences
between the sobs were plainly audible. It seemed so
terrible to hear a grown person cry, that Georgina
felt as she did that morning long ago, when old Jeremy&rsquo;s
teeth flew into the fire. Her confidence was shaken
in the world. She felt there could be no abiding happiness
in anything.

&ldquo;She&rsquo;s begging him not to tell,&rdquo;
whispered Richard.

&ldquo;But I owe it to Danny,&rdquo; they heard Uncle
Darcy say. And then, &ldquo;Why should I spare Emmett&rsquo;s
father? Emmett never spared me, he never spared Danny.&rdquo;

An indistinct murmur as if Belle&rsquo;s answer was
muffled in her handkerchief, then Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s
voice again:

&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair that the town should go
on counting him a hero and brand my boy as a coward,
when it&rsquo;s Emmett who was the coward as well as
the thief.&rdquo;

Again Belle&rsquo;s voice in a quick cry of pain,
as sharp as if she had been struck. Then the sound
of another door shutting, and when the voices began
again it was evident they had withdrawn into the kitchen.

&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want Aunt Elspeth to hear,&rdquo;
said Georgina.

&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; asked Richard,
much mystified.

Georgina told him all that she knew herself, gathered
from the scraps she had heard the day of Cousin Mehitable&rsquo;s
visit, and from various sources since; told him in
a half whisper stopping now and then when some fragment
of a sentence floated out to them from the kitchen;
for occasional words still continued to reach them
through the windows in the rear, when the voices rose
at intervals to a higher pitch.

What passed behind those closed doors the children
never knew. They felt rather than understood what
was happening. Belle&rsquo;s pleading was beginning
to be effectual, and the old man was rising to the
same heights of self-sacrifice which Dan had reached,
when he slipped away from home with the taint of his
friend&rsquo;s disgrace upon him in order to save that
friend.

That some soul tragedy had been enacted m that little
room the children felt vaguely when Belle came out
after a while. Her eyes were red and swollen and her
face drawn and pinched looking. She did not glance
in their direction, but stood with her face averted
and hand on the gate-latch while Uncle Darcy stopped
beside the swing.

&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;I
want you to promise me never to speak to anyone about
finding that note in the old rifle till I give you
permission. Will you do this for me, just because I
ask it, even if I can&rsquo;t tell you why?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t I even tell Barby?&rdquo; asked
Georgina, anxiously.

He hesitated, glancing uncertainly at Belle, then
answered:

&ldquo;No, not even your mother, till I tell you that
you can. Now you see what a very important secret
it is. Can _you_ keep it, son? Will you
promise me too?&rdquo;

He turned to Richard with the question. With a finger
under the boy&rsquo;s chin he tipped up his face and
looked into it searchingly. The serious, brown eyes
looked back into his, honest and unflinching.

&ldquo;Yes, I promise,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Honor
bright I&rsquo;ll not tell.&rdquo;

The old man turned to the waiting figure at the gate.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Belle. You needn&rsquo;t
worry about it any more. You can trust us.&rdquo;

She made no answer, but looking as if she had aged
years in the last half hour, she passed through the
gate and into the sandy court, moving slowly across
it towards the street beyond.

With a long-drawn sigh the old man sank down on the
door-step and buried his face in his hands. They were
still shaking as if he had the palsy. For some time
the children sat in embarrassed silence, thinking every
moment that he would look up and say something. They
wanted to go, but waited for him to make some movement.
He seemed to have forgotten they were there. Finally
a clock inside the cottage began striking five. It
broke the spell which bound them.

&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; whispered Richard.

&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was the answer, also whispered.
&ldquo;Wait till I take the shovel and can lid back
to the kitchen.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he offered.
&ldquo;I want to get a drink, anyhow.&rdquo;

Stealthily, as if playing Indian, they stepped out
of the swing and tiptoed through the grass around
the corner of the house. Even the dog went noiselessly,
instead of frisking and barking as he usually did when
starting anywhere. Their return was equally stealthy.
As they slipped through the gate Georgina looked back
at the old man. He was still sitting on the step,
his face in his hands, as if he were bowed down by
some weight too heavy for his shoulders to bear.

The weary hopelessness of his attitude made her want
to run back and throw her arms around his neck, but
she did not dare. Trouble as great as that seemed
to raise a wall around itself. It could not be comforted
by a caress. The only thing to do was to slip past
and not look.

Richard shared the same awe, for he went away leaving
the rifle lying in the grass. Instinctively he felt
that it ought not to be played with now. It was the
rifle which had changed everything.

Chapter XIII
Lost and Found at the Liniment Wagon

With Mrs. Triplett back in bed again on account of
the rheumatism which crippled her, and Belle going
about white of face and sick of soul, home held little
cheer for Georgina. But with Mrs. Triplett averse to
company of any kind, and Belle anxious to be alone
with her misery, there was nothing to hinder Georgina
from seeking cheer elsewhere and she sought it early
and late.

She had spent her birthday dollar in imagination many
times before she took her check to the bank to have
it cashed. With Richard to lend her courage, and Manuel,
Joseph and Rosa trailing after by special invitation,
she walked in and asked for Mr. Gates. That is the
way Barby always did, and as far as Georgina knew
he was the only one to apply to for money.

The paying teller hesitated a moment about summoning
the president of the bank from his private office
at the behest of so small a child, so small that even
on tiptoe her eyes could barely peer into the window
of his cage. But they were entreating eyes, so big
and brown and sure of their appeal that he decided
to do their bidding.

Just as he turned to knock at the door behind him
it opened, and Mr. Gates came out with the man with
whom he had been closeted in private conference. It
was Richard&rsquo;s Cousin James. The children did
not see him, however, for he stopped at one of the
high desks inside to look at some papers which one
of the clerks spread out before him.

&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s my little friend, Georgina,&rdquo;
said Mr. Gates, smiling in response to the beaming
smile she gave him. &ldquo;Well, what can I do for
you, my dear?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Cash my check, please,&rdquo; she said, pushing
the slip of paper towards him with as grand an air
as if it had been for a million dollars instead of
one, &ldquo;and all in nickels, please.&rdquo;

He glanced at the name she had written painstakingly
across the back.

&ldquo;Well, Miss Huntingdon,&rdquo; he exclaimed
gravely, although there was a twinkle in his eyes,
&ldquo;if all lady customers were as businesslike in
endorsing their checks and in knowing what they want,
we bankers would be spared a lot of trouble.&rdquo;

It was the first time that Georgina had ever been
called Miss Huntingdon, and knowing he said it to
tease her, it embarrassed her to the point of making
her stammer, when he asked her most unexpectedly while
picking out twenty shining new nickels to stuff into
the little red purse:

&ldquo;All of these going to buy tracts for the missionaries
to take to the little heathen?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re all going to--to----&rdquo;

She didn&rsquo;t like to say for soda water and chewing
gum and the movies, and hesitated till a substitute
word occurred to her.

&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all going to go for buying good
times. It&rsquo;s for a sort of a club we made up
this morning, Richard and me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;May I ask the name of the club?&rdquo;

Georgina glanced around. No other customer happened
to be in the bank at the moment and Richard had wandered
out to the street to wait for her. So tiptoeing a
little higher she said in a low tone as if imparting
a secret:

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the _Rainbow_ Club. We
pretend that everytime we make anybody happy we&rsquo;ve
made a little rainbow in the world.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, bless your heart,&rdquo; was the appreciative
answer. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already made one in here.
You do that every time you come around.&rdquo;

Then he looked thoughtfully at her over his spectacles.

&ldquo;Would you take an old fellow like me into your
club?&rdquo;

Georgina considered a moment, first stealing a glance
at him to see if he were in earnest or still trying
to tease. He seemed quite serious so she answered:

&ldquo;If you really _want_ to belong. Anybody
with a bank full of money ought to be able to make
happy times for the whole town.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Any dues to pay? What are the rules and what
are the duties of a member?&rdquo;

Again Georgina was embarrassed. He seemed to expect
so much more than she had to offer. She swung the
red purse around nervously as she answered:

&ldquo;I guess you won&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s much
of a club. There&rsquo;s nothing to it but just its
name, and all we do is just to go around making what
it says.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Count me as Member number Three,&rdquo; said
Mr. Gates gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to join
you. Shake hands on it. I&rsquo;ll try to be a credit
to the organization, and I hope you&rsquo;ll drop
around once in a while and let me know how it&rsquo;s
getting along.&rdquo;

The beaming smile with which Georgina shook hands
came back to him all morning at intervals.

Cousin James Milford, who had been an interested listener,
followed her out of the bank presently and as he drove
his machine slowly past the drug-store he saw the
five children draining their glasses at the soda-water
fountain. He stopped, thinking to invite Richard and
Georgina to go to Truro with him. It never would have
occurred to him to give the three little Portuguese
children a ride also had he not overheard that conversation
in the bank.

&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; he asked himself, smiling
inwardly. &ldquo;It might as well be rainbows for
the crowd while I&rsquo;m about it.&rdquo;

So for the first time in their lives Manuel and Joseph
and Rosa rode in one of the &ldquo;honk wagons&rdquo;
which heretofore they had known only as something
to be dodged when one walked abroad. Judging by the
blissful grins which took permanent lodging on their
dirty faces, Cousin James was eligible to the highest
position the new club could bestow, if ever he should
apply for membership.

If Mrs. Triplett had been downstairs that evening,
none of the birthday nickels would have found their
way through the ticket window of the moving picture
show. She supposed that Georgina was reading as usual
beside the evening lamp, or was out on the front porch
talking to Belle. But Belle, not caring to talk to
anyone, had given instant consent when Georgina, who
wanted to go to the show, having seen wonderful posters
advertising it, suggested that Mrs. Fayal would take
her in charge. She did not add that she had already
seen Mrs. Fayal and promised to provide tickets for
her and the children in case she could get permission
from home. Belle did not seem interested in hearing
such things, so Georgina hurried off lest something
might happen to interfere before she was beyond the
reach of summoning voices.

On the return from Truro she had asked to be put out
at the Fayal cottage, having it in mind to make some
such arrangement. Manuel had seen one show, but Joseph
and Rosa had never so much as had their heads inside
of one. She found Mrs. Fayal glooming over a wash-tub,
not because she objected to washing for the summer
people. She was used to that, having done it six days
out of seven every summer since she had married Joe
Fayal. What she was glooming over was that Joe was
home from a week&rsquo;s fishing trip with his share
of the money for the biggest catch of the season,
and not a dime of it had she seen. It had all gone
into the pocket of an itinerant vendor, and Joe was
lying in a sodden stupor out under the grape arbor
at the side of the cottage.

Georgina started to back away when she found the state
of affairs. She did not suppose Mrs. Fayal would have
a mind for merry-making under the circumstances. But,
indeed, Mrs. Fayal did.

&ldquo;All the more reason that I should go off and
forget my troubles and have a good time for a while,&rdquo;
she said decidedly. Georgina recognized the spirit
if not the words of her own &ldquo;line to live by.&rdquo;
Mrs. Fayal could bear up and steer onward with a joyful
heart any time she had the price of admission to a
movie in her pocket. So feeling that as a member of
the new club she could not have a better opportunity
to make good its name, Georgina promised the tickets
for the family even if she could not go herself. She
would send them by Richard if not allowed to take them
in person.

It was still light when Georgina fared forth at the
end of the long summer day. Richard joined her at
the foot of the Green Stairs with the price of his
own ticket in his pocket, and Captain Kidd tagging
at his heels.

&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t let the dog into the show,&rdquo;
Georgina reminded him.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, and he might get into a fight
or run over if I left him outside,&rdquo; Richard
answered. &ldquo;B&rsquo;leeve I&rsquo;ll shut him
up in the garage.&rdquo;

This he did, fastening the door securely, and returning
in time to see the rest of the party turning the corner,
and coming towards the Green Stairs.

Mrs. Fayal, after her long day over the wash-tub,
was resplendent in lavender shirt-waist, blue serge
skirt and white tennis shoes, with long gold ear-rings
dangling half-way to her shoulders. Manuel and Joseph
were barefooted as usual, and in over-alls as usual,
but their lack of gala attire was made up for by Rosa&rsquo;s.
No wax doll was ever more daintily and lacily dressed.
Georgina looked at her in surprise, wishing Tippy could
see her now. Rosa in her white dress and slippers and
with her face clean, was a little beauty.

Mrs. Fayal made a delightful chaperon. She was just
as ready as anyone in her train to stop in front of
shop windows, to straggle slowly down the middle of
the street, or to thrust her hand into Richard&rsquo;s
bag of peanuts whenever he passed it around. Cracking
shells and munching the nuts, they strolled along
with a sense of freedom which thrilled Georgina to
the core. She had never felt it before. She had just
bought five tickets and Richard his one, and they
were about to pass in although Mrs. Fayal said it
was early yet, when a deep voice roaring through the
crowd attracted their attention. It was as sonorous
as a megaphone.

&ldquo;Walk up, ladies and gentlemen. See the wild-cat,
_Texas Tim,_ brought from the banks of the
Brazos.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; said Richard and Georgina
in the same breath. Mrs. Fayal, out for a good time
and to see all that was to be seen, bobbed her long
earrings in gracious assent, and headed the procession,
in order that her ample form might make an entering
wedge for the others, as she elbowed her way through
the crowd gathered at the street end of Railroad wharf.

It clustered thickest around a wagon in which stood
a broad-shouldered man, mounted on a chair. He wore
a cow-boy hat. A flaming torch set up beside the wagon
lighted a cage in one end of it, in which crouched
a wild-cat bewildered by the light and the bedlam
of noisy, pushing human beings. The children could
not see the animal at first, but pushed nearer the
wagon to hear what the man was saying. He held up a
bottle and shook it over the heads of the people.

&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your marvelous rheumatism remedy,&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;made from the fat of wild-cats. Warranted
to cure every kind of ache, sprain and misery known
to man. Only fifty cents, ladies and gentlemen, sure
cure or your money back. Anybody here with an ache
or a pain?&rdquo;

The children pushed closer. Richard, feeling the effect
of the gun-powder he had eaten, turned to Georgina.

&ldquo;I dare you to climb up and touch the end of
the wild-cat&rsquo;s tail.&rdquo;

Georgina stood on tiptoe, then dodged under someone&rsquo;s
elbow for a nearer view. The end of the tail protruded
from between the bars of the cage, in easy reach if
one were on the wagon, but those furtive eyes keeping
watch above it were savage in their gleaming. Then
she, too, remembered the gun-powder.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it if you will.&rdquo;

Before Richard could put the gun-powder to the test
the man reached down for a guitar leaning against
his chair, and with a twanging of chords which made
the shifting people on the outskirts stand still to
see what would happen next, he began to sing a song
that had been popular in his youth. Or, rather, it
was a parody of the song. Georgina recognized it as
one that she had heard Uncle Darcy sing, and even Tippy
hummed it sometimes when she was sewing. It was, &ldquo;When
you and I were young, Maggie.&rdquo;

They say we are aged and gray, Maggie,
As spray by the white breakers flung,
But the liniment keeps us as spry, Maggie,
As when you and I were young.&rdquo;

Several people laughed and passed on when the song
was done, but the greater part of the crowd stayed,
hoping to hear another, for the voice was a powerful
one and fairly sweet.

&ldquo;Anybody here with any aches or pains?&rdquo;
he called again. &ldquo;If so, step this way, please,
and let me make a simple demonstration of how quickly
this magic oil will cure you.&rdquo;

There was a commotion near the wagon, and a man pushed
his way through and climbed up on the wheel. He offered
a stiff wrist for treatment. The vendor tipped up
the bottle and poured out some pungent volatile oil
from the bottle, the odor of which was far-reaching.
He rubbed the wrist briskly for a moment, then gave
it a slap saying, &ldquo;Now see what you can do with
it, my friend.&rdquo;

The patient scowled at it, twisting his arm in every
possible direction as if skeptical of any help from
such a source, but gradually letting a look of pleased
surprise spread across his face. The crowd watched
in amusement, and nearly everybody laughed when the
patient finally announced in a loud voice that he
was cured, that it was nothing short of a miracle
and that he&rsquo;d buy half a dozen bottles of that
witch stuff to take home to his friends.

The vendor began his speech-making again, calling
attention to the cure they had just witnessed, and
urging others to follow. As the subject of the cure
stepped down from the wheel Richard sprang up in his
place. Georgina, pressing closer, saw him lean over
the side of the wagon and boldly take hold of the
end of the beast&rsquo;s tail.

&ldquo;There. I did it,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Now
it&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo;

Georgina gave one glance at the wild-cat&rsquo;s eyes
and drew back. They seemed to glare directly at her.
She wondered how strong the bars were, and if they
would hold the beast in case it rose up in a rage and
sprang at her. But Richard was waiting, and she clambered
up on the hub of the wheel. Luckily its owner was
turned towards the other side at that moment or she
might have been ordered down.

&ldquo;There! I did it, too,&rdquo; she announced
an instant later. &ldquo;Now you can&rsquo;t crow
over me.&rdquo;

She was about to step down when she saw in the other
end of the wagon, something she had not been able
to see from her place on the ground under the elbows
of the crowd. In a low rocking chair sat an elderly
woman, oddly out of place in this traveling medicine
show as far as appearance was concerned. She had a
calm, motherly face, gray hair combed smoothly down
over her ears, a plain old-fashioned gray dress and
an air of being perfectly at home. It was the serene,
unconscious manner one would have in sitting on the
door-step at home. She did not seem to belong in the
midst of this seething curious mass, or to realize
that she was a part of the show. She smiled now at
Georgina in such a friendly way that Georgina smiled
back and continued to stand on the wheel. She hoped
that this nice old lady would say something about
the virtues of the medicine, for it cured two more
people, even while she looked, and if she could be
sure it did all that was claimed for it she would
spend all the rest of her birthday money in buying
a bottle for Tippy.

The placid old lady said nothing, but her reassuring
presence finally made Georgina decide to buy the bottle,
and she emptied the red purse of everything except
the tickets. Then the man embarrassed her until her
cheeks flamed.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, little girl. Carry it to
the dear sufferer at home who will bless you for your
kindness. Anybody else here who will imitate this
child&rsquo;s generous act? If you haven&rsquo;t any
pain yourself, show your gratitude by thinking of
someone less fortunate than you.&rdquo;

Georgina felt that her blushes were burning her up
at thus being made the centre of public notice. She
almost fell off the wheel in her haste to get down,
and in doing so stumbled over a dog which suddenly
emerged from under the wagon at that instant.

&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Captain Kidd!&rdquo; she exclaimed
in astonishment. &ldquo;How ever did he get here?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Must have scratched under the door and trailed
us,&rdquo; answered Richard. &ldquo;Go on home, sir!&rdquo;
he commanded, sternly, stamping his foot. &ldquo;You
know they won&rsquo;t let you into the show with us,
and you&rsquo;ll get into trouble if you stay downtown
alone. Go on home I say.&rdquo;

With drooping tail and a look so reproachful that
it was fairly human, Captain Kidd slunk away, starting
mournfully homeward. He sneaked back in a few minutes,
however, and trailed his party as far as the door of
the theatre. Somebody kicked at him and he fled down
the street again, retracing the trail that had led
him to the wagon.

A long time after when the performance was nearly
over he went swinging up the beach with something
in his mouth which he had picked up from near the
end of the wagon. It was a tobacco pouch of soft gray
leather that had never been used for tobacco. There
was something hard and round inside which felt like
a bone. At the top of the Green Stairs he lay down
and mouthed it a while, tugging at it with his sharp
teeth; but after he had mumbled and gnawed it for
some time without bringing the bone any nearer the
surface, he grew tired of his newfound plaything. Dropping
it in the grass, he betook himself to the door-mat
on the front porch, to await his master&rsquo;s return.

Chapter XIV
Buried Treasure

When Georgina tiptoed up the walk to the front porch
where Belle sat waiting for her in the moonlight,
Tippy called down that she wasn&rsquo;t asleep, and
they needn&rsquo;t stay out there on her account, whispering.
It did not seem an auspicious time to present the
bottle of liniment, but to Georgina&rsquo;s surprise
Tippy seemed glad to try the new remedy. The long-continued
pain which refused to yield to treatment made her willing
to try anything which promised relief.

It was vile-smelling stuff, so pungent that whenever
the cork was taken out of the bottle the whole house
knew it, but it burned with soothing fire and Tippy
rose up and called it blessed before the next day was
over. Before that happened, however, Georgina took
advantage of Belle&rsquo;s easy rule to leave home
as soon as her little morning tasks were done. Strolling
down the board-walk with many stops she came at last
to the foot of the Green Stairs. Richard sat on the
top step, tugging at a knotted string.

&ldquo;Come on up,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;See what
I&rsquo;ve taken away from Captain Kidd. He was just
starting to bury it. Looks like a tobacco pouch, but
I haven&rsquo;t got it untied yet. He made the string
all wet, gnawing on it.&rdquo;

Georgina climbed to the top of the steps and sat down
beside him, watching in deep and silent interest.
When the string finally gave way she offered her lap
to receive the contents of the pouch. Two five-dollar
gold pieces rolled out first, then a handful of small
change, a black ring evidently whittled out of a rubber
button and lastly a watch-fob ornament. It was a little
compass, set in something which looked like a nut.

&ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s a buckeye,&rdquo; said
Richard. He examined it carefully on all sides, then
called excitedly:

&ldquo;Aw, look here! See those letters scratched
on the side--&rsquo;D. D.&rsquo;? That stands for
my name, Dare-devil Dick. I&rsquo;m going to keep it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cunningest thing I ever saw,&rdquo;
declared Georgina in a tone both admiring and envious,
which plainly showed that she wished the initials
were such as could be claimed by a Gory George. Then
she picked up the pouch and thrust in her hand. Something
rustled. It was a letter. Evidently it had been forwarded
many times, for the envelope was entirely criss-crossed
with names that had been written and blotted out that
new ones might be added. All they could make out was
&ldquo;Mrs. Henry&rdquo;--&ldquo;Texas&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Mass.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have that stamp for my album,&rdquo;
said Richard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s foreign. Seems to
me I&rsquo;ve got one that looks something like it,
but I&rsquo;m not sure. Maybe the letter will tell
who the pouch belongs to.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t read other people&rsquo;s
letters,&rdquo; objected Georgina.

&ldquo;Well, who wants to? It won&rsquo;t be reading
it just to look at the head and tail, will it?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Georgina, hesitatingly.
&ldquo;Though it does seem like peeking.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, if you lost something wouldn&rsquo;t
you rather whoever found it should peek and find out
it was yours, than to have it stay lost forever?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes, I s&rsquo;pose so.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look, then.&rdquo;

Two heads bent over the sheet spread out on Richard&rsquo;s
knee. They read slowly in unison, &ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo;
then turned over the paper and sought the last line.
&ldquo;Your grateful friend Dave.&rdquo;

&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know any more now than we did
before,&rdquo; said Georgina, virtuously folding up
the letter and slipping it back into the envelope.

&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it to Uncle Darcy. Then he&rsquo;ll
let us go along and ring the bell when he calls, &lsquo;Found.&rsquo;&rdquo;

Richard had two objections to this. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d
pay him for doing it? Besides, it&rsquo;s gold money,
and anybody who loses that much would advertise for
it in the papers. Let&rsquo;s keep it till this week&rsquo;s
papers come out, and then we&rsquo;ll have the fun
of taking it to the person who lost it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be safe for us to keep it,&rdquo;
was Georgina&rsquo;s next objection. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
gold money and burglars might find out we had it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you&rdquo;--Richard&rsquo;s
face shone as he made the suggestion-- &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
_bury_ it. That will keep it safe till we
can find the owner, and when we dig it up we can play
it&rsquo;s pirate gold and it&rsquo;ll be like finding
real treasure.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Lets!&rdquo; agreed Georgina. &ldquo;We can
keep out something, a nickel or a dime, and when we
go to dig up the pouch we can throw it over toward
the place where we buried the bag and say, &lsquo;Brother,
go find your brother,&rsquo; the way Tom Sawyer did.
Then we&rsquo;ll be certain to hit the spot.&rdquo;

Richard picked up the compass, and rubbed the polished
sides of the nut in which it was set.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep this out instead of a nickel.
I wonder what the fellow&rsquo;s name was that this
D. D. stands for?&rdquo;

Half an hour later two bloody-minded sea-robbers slipped
through the back gate of the Milford place and took
their stealthy way out into the dunes. No fierce mustachios
or hoop ear-rings marked them on this occasion as
the Dread Destroyer or the Menace of the Main. The
time did not seem favorable for donning their real
costumes. So one went disguised as a dainty maiden
in a short pink frock and long brown curls, and the
other as a sturdy boy in a grass-stained linen suit
with a hole in the knee of his stocking. But their
speech would have betrayed their evil business had
anyone been in earshot of it. One would have thought
it was

&ldquo;Wild Roger come again.
He spoke of forays and of frays upon the Spanish Main.&rdquo;

Having real gold to bury made the whole affair seem
a real adventure. They were recounting to each other
as they dug, the bloody fight it had taken to secure
this lot of treasure.

Down in a hollow where the surrounding sandridges
sheltered them from view, they crouched over a small
basket they had brought with them and performed certain
ceremonies. First the pouch was wrapped in many sheets
of tin foil, which Richard had been long in collecting
from various tobacco-loving friends. When that was
done it flashed in the sun like a nugget of wrinkled
silver. This was stuffed into a baking-powder can from
which the label had been carefully scraped, and on
whose lid had been scratched with a nail, the names
Georgina Huntingdon and Richard Moreland, with the
date.

&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better put our everyday names on
it instead of our pirate names,&rdquo; Gory George
suggested. &ldquo;For if anything should happen that
some other pirate dug it up first they wouldn&rsquo;t
know who the Dread Destroyer and the Menace of the
Main were.&rdquo;

Lastly, from the basket was taken the end of a wax
candle, several matches and a stick of red sealing-wax,
borrowed from Cousin James&rsquo; desk. Holding the
end of the sealing-wax over the lighted candle until
it was soft and dripping, Richard daubed it around
the edge of the can lid, as he had seen the man in
the express office seal packages. He had always longed
to try it himself. There was something peculiarly pleasing
in the smell of melted sealing-wax. Georgina found
it equally alluring. She took the stick away from
him when it was about half used, and finished it.

&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any to put back in Cousin
James&rsquo; desk if you keep on using it,&rdquo;
he warned her.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not using any more than you did,&rdquo;
she answered, and calmly proceeded to smear on the
remainder. &ldquo;If you had let me seal with the first
end of the stick, you&rsquo;d have had all the last
end to save.&rdquo;

All this time Captain Kidd sat close beside them,
an interested spectator, but as they began digging
the hole he rushed towards it and pawed violently
at each shovelful of sand thrown out.

&ldquo;Aw, let him help!&rdquo; Richard exclaimed
when Georgina ordered him to stop. &ldquo;He ought
to have a part in it because he found the pouch and
was starting to bury it his own self when I took it
away from him and spoiled his fun.&rdquo;

Georgina saw the justice of the claim and allowed
Captain Kidd to join in as he pleased, but no sooner
did they stop digging to give him a chance than he
stopped also.

&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; called Richard in a shrill whisper.

At that familiar word the dog began digging so frantically
that the sand flew in every direction. Each time he
paused for breath Richard called &ldquo;Rats&rdquo;
again. It doubled the interest for both children to
have the dog take such frantic and earnest part in
their game.

When the hole was pronounced deep enough the can was
dropped in, the sand shoveled over it and tramped
down, and a marker made. A long, forked stick, broken
from a bayberry bush, was run into the ground so that
only the fork of it was visible. Then at twenty paces
from the stick, Richard stepping them off in four
directions, consulting the little compass in so doing,
Georgina placed the markers, four sections of a broken
crock rescued from the ash-barrel and brought down
in the basket for that especial purpose.

&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let it stay buried for a week,&rdquo;
said Richard when all was done. &ldquo;Unless somebody
claims it sooner. If they don&rsquo;t come in a week,
then we&rsquo;ll know they&rsquo;re never coming,
and the gold will be ours.&rdquo;

Chapter XV
A Narrow Escape

Mr. Milford was stretched out in a hammock on the
front porch of the bungalow when the children came
back from the dunes with their empty basket. They
could not see him as they climbed up the terrace, the
porch being high above them and draped with vines;
and he deep in a new book was only vaguely conscious
of approaching voices.

They were discussing the &ldquo;Rescues of Rosalind,&rdquo;
the play they had seen the night before on the films.
Their shrill, eager tones would have attracted the
attention of anyone less absorbed than Mr. Milford.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Georgina
was saying. &ldquo;If you were gagged and bound the
way Rosalind was, you _couldn&rsquo;t_ get
loose, no matter how you squirmed and twisted.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Come back in the garage and try me,&rdquo;
Richard retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove it to you
that I can.&rdquo;

&ldquo;_Always_ an automobile dashes up
and there&rsquo;s a chase. It&rsquo;s been that way
in every movie I ever saw,&rdquo; announced Georgina
with the air of one who has attended nightly through
many seasons.

&ldquo;I can do that part all right,&rdquo; declared
Richard. &ldquo;I can run an automobile.&rdquo;

There was no disputing that fact, no matter how contradictory
Georgina&rsquo;s frame of mind. Only the day before
she had seen him take the wheel and run the car for
three miles under the direction of Cousin James, when
they came to a level stretch of road.

&ldquo;Yes, but you know your Cousin James said you
were never to do it unless he was along himself. You
wasn&rsquo;t to dare to touch it when you were out
with only the chauffeur.&rdquo;

&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t care if we got in and didn&rsquo;t
start anything but the engine,&rdquo; said Richard.
&ldquo;Climb in and play that I&rsquo;m running away
with you. With the motor chugging away and shaking
the machine it&rsquo;ll seem as if we&rsquo;re really
going.&rdquo;

By this time they were inside the garage, with the
doors closed behind them.

&ldquo;Now you get in and keep looking back the way
Rosalind did to see how near they are to catching
us.&rdquo;

Instantly Georgina threw herself into the spirit of
the game. Climbing into the back seat she assumed
the pose of the kidnapped bride whose adventures had
thrilled them the night before.

&ldquo;Play my white veil is floating out in the wind,&rdquo;
she commanded, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m looking back and
waving to my husband to come faster and take me away
from the dreadful villain who is going to kill me for
my jewels. I wish this car was out of doors instead
of in this dark garage. When I look back I look bang
against the closed door every time, aid I can&rsquo;t
make it seem as if I was seeing far down the road.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Play it&rsquo;s night,&rdquo; suggested Richard.
He had put on a pair of goggles and was making a great
pretence of getting ready to start. Georgina, leaning
out as Rosalind had done, waved her lily hand in frantic
beckonings for her rescuers to follow faster. The
motor chugged harder and harder. The car shook violently.

To the vivid imaginations of the passengers, the chase
was as exciting as if the automobile were really plunging
down the road instead of throbbing steadily in one
spot in the dim garage. The gas rolling up from somewhere
in the back made it wonderfully realistic. But out
on the open road the smell of burning gasoline would
not have been so overpowering. Inside the little box-like
garage it began to close in on them and settle down
like a dense fog.

Georgina coughed and Richard looked back apprehensively,
feeling that something was wrong, and if that queer
smoke didn&rsquo;t stop pouring out in such a thick
cloud he&rsquo;d have to shut off the engine or do
something. Another moment passed and he leaned forward,
fumbling for the key, but he couldn&rsquo;t find it.
He had grown queerly confused and light-headed. He
couldn&rsquo;t make his fingers move where he wanted
them to go.

He looked back at Georgina. She wasn&rsquo;t waving
her hands any more. She was lying limply back on the
seat as if too tired to play any longer. And a thousand
miles away--at least it sounded that far--above the
terrific noise the motor was making, he heard Captain
Kidd barking. They were short, excited barks, so thin
and queer, almost as thin and queer as if he were
barking with the voice of a mosquito instead of his
own.

And then--Richard heard nothing more, not even the
noise of the motor. His hand dropped from the wheel,
and he began slipping down, down from the seat to
the floor of the car, white and limp, overcome like
Georgina, by the fumes of the poisonous gas rolling
up from the carburetor.

Mr. Milford, up in the hammock, had been vaguely conscious
for several minutes of unusual sounds somewhere in
the neighborhood, but it was not until he reached
the end of the chapter that he took any intelligent
notice. Then he looked up thinking somebody&rsquo;s
machine was making a terrible fuss somewhere near.
But it wasn&rsquo;t that sound which made him sit
up in the hammock. It was Captain Kidd&rsquo;s frantic
barking and yelping and whining as if something terrible
was happening to him.

Standing up to stretch himself, then walking to the
corner of the porch, Mr. Milford looked out. He could
see the little terrier alternately scratching on the
garage door and making frantic efforts to dig under
it. Evidently he felt left out and was trying desperately
to join his little playmates, or else he felt that
something was wrong inside.

Then it came to Mr. Milford in a flash that something
was wrong inside. Nobody ever touched that machine
but himself and the chauffeur, and the chauffeur,
who was having a day off, was half-way to Yarmouth
by this time. He didn&rsquo;t wait to go down by the
steps. With one leap he was over the railing, crashing
through the vines, and running down the terrace to
the garage.

As he rolled back one of the sliding doors a suffocating
burst of gas rushed into his face. He pushed both
doors open wide, and with a hand over his mouth and
nose hurried through the heavily-charged atmosphere
to shut off the motor. The fresh air rushing in, began
clearing away the fumes, and he seized Georgina and
carried her out, thinking she would be revived by
the time he was back with Richard. But neither child
stirred from the grass where he stretched them out.

As he called for the cook and the housekeeper, there
flashed into his mind an account he had read recently
in a New York paper, of a man and his wife who had
been asphyxiated in just such a way as this. Now thoroughly
alarmed, he sent the cook running down the Green Stairs
to summon Richard&rsquo;s father from the studio,
and the housekeeper to telephone in various directions.
Three doctors were there in a miraculously short time,
but despite all they could do at the end of half an
hour both little figures still lay white and motionless.

Then the pulmotor that had been frantically telephoned
for arrived from the life-saving station, and just
as the man dashed up with that, Mrs. Triplett staggered
up the terrace, her knees shaking so that she could
scarcely manage to climb the last few steps.

Afterwards, the happenings of the day were very hazy
in Georgina&rsquo;s mind. She had an indistinct recollection
of being lifted in somebody&rsquo;s arms and moved
about, and of feeling very sick and weak. Somebody
said soothingly to somebody who was crying:

&ldquo;Oh, the worst is over now. They&rsquo;re both
beginning to come around.&rdquo;

Then she was in her own bed and the wild-cat from
the banks of the Brazos was bending over her. At least,
she thought it was the wild-cat, because she smelled
the liniment as strongly as she did when she climbed
up in the wagon beside it. But when she opened her
eyes it was Tippy who was bending over her, smoothing
her curls in a comforting, purry way, but the smell
of liniment still hung in the air.

Then Georgina remembered something that must have
happened before she was carried home from the bungalow--Captain
Kidd squirming out of Tippy&rsquo;s arms, and Tippy
with the tears streaming down her face trying to hold
him and hug him as if he had been a person, and the
Milford&rsquo;s cook saying: &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t
been for the little beast&rsquo;s barkin&rsquo; they&rsquo;d
have been dead in a few minutes more. Then there&rsquo;d
have been a double funeral, poor lambs.&rdquo;

Georgina smiled drowsily now and slipped off to sleep
again, but later when she awakened the charm of the
cook&rsquo;s phrase aroused her thoroughly, and she
lay wondering what &ldquo;a double funeral&rdquo; was
like. Would it have been at her house or Richard&rsquo;s?
Would two little white coffins have stood side by
side, or would each have been in its own place, with
the two solemn processions meeting and joining at
the foot of the Green Stairs. Maybe they would have
put on her tombstone, &ldquo;None knew her but to love
her.&rdquo; No, that couldn&rsquo;t be said about her.
She&rsquo;d been wilfully disobedient too often for
that, like the time she played with the Portuguese
children on purpose to spite Tippy. She was sorry for
that disobedience now, for she had discovered that
Tippy was fonder of her than she had supposed. She
had proved it by hugging Captain Kidd so gratefully
for saving their lives, when she simply _loathed_
dogs.

Somehow Georgina felt that she was better acquainted
with Mrs. Triplett than she had ever been before,
and fonder of her. Lying there in the dark she made
several good resolutions. She was going to be a better
girl in the future. She was going to do kind, lovely
things for everybody, so that if an early tomb should
claim her, every heart in town would be saddened by
her going. It would be lovely to leave a widespread
heartache behind her. She wished she could live such
a life that there wouldn&rsquo;t be a dry eye in the
town when it was whispered from house to house that
little Georgina Huntingdon was with the angels.

She pictured Belle&rsquo;s grief, and Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s
and Richard&rsquo;s. She had already seen Tippy&rsquo;s.
But it was a very different thing when she thought
of Barby. There was no pleasure in imagining Barby&rsquo;s
grief. There was something too real and sharp in the
pain which darted into her own heart at the thought
of it. She wanted to put her arms around her mother
and ward off sorrow and trouble from her and keep
all tears away from those dear eyes. She wanted to
grow up and take care of her darling Barby and protect
her from the Tishbite.

Suddenly it occurred to Georgina that in this escape
she had been kept from the power of that mysterious
evil which had threatened her ever since she called
it forth by doing such a wicked thing as to use the
&ldquo;Sacred Book&rdquo; to work a charm.

She had been put to bed in the daytime, hence her
evening petitions were still unsaid. Now she pulled
the covers over her head and included them all in
one fervent appeal:

&ldquo;And keep on delivering us from the Tishbite,
forever and ever, Amen!&rdquo;

Chapter XVI
What the Storm Did

Next morning nearly everyone in the town was talking
about the storm. Belle said what with the booming
of the waves against the breakwater and the wind rattling
the shutters, she hadn&rsquo;t slept a wink all night.
It seemed as if every gust would surely take the house
off its foundations.

Old Jeremy reported that it was one of the worst wind-storms
ever known along the Cape, wild enough to blow all
the sand dunes into the sea. They&rsquo;d had the
best shaking up and shifting around that they&rsquo;d
had in years, he declared. Captain Ames&rsquo; cranberry
bog was buried so deep in sand you couldn&rsquo;t
see a blossom or a leaf. And there was sand drifted
all over the garden. It had whirled clear over the
wall, till the bird pool was half full of it.

Georgina listened languidly, feeling very comfortable
and important with her breakfast brought in to her
on a tray. Tippy thought it was too chilly for her
in the dining-room where there was no fire. Jeremy
had kindled a cheerful blaze on the living-room hearth
and his tales of damage done to the shipping and to
roofs and chimneys about town, seemed to emphasize
her own safety and comfort. The only thing which made
the storm seem a personal affair was the big limb
blown off the willow tree.

Mrs. Triplett and Jeremy could remember a storm years
ago which shifted the sand until the whole face of
the Cape seemed changed. That was before the Government
planted grass all over it, to bind it together with
firm roots. Later when the ring of an axe told that
the willow limb was being chopped in pieces, Georgina
begged to be allowed to go outdoors.

&ldquo;Let me go out and see the tracks of the storm,&rdquo;
she urged. &ldquo;I feel all right. I&rsquo;m all
over the gas now.&rdquo;

But Mrs. Triplett preferred to run no risks. All she
said to Georgina was:

&ldquo;No, after such a close call as you had yesterday
you stay right here where I can keep an eye on you,
and take it quietly for a day or two,&rdquo; but when
she went into the next room Georgina heard her say
to Belle:

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no knowing how that gas may have
affected her heart.&rdquo;

Georgina made a face at the first speech, but the
second one made her lie down languidly on the sofa
with her finger on her pulse. She was half persuaded
that there was something wrong with the way it beat,
and was about to ask faintly if she couldn&rsquo;t
have a little blackberry cordial with her lunch, when
she heard Richard&rsquo;s alley call outside and Captain
Kidd&rsquo;s quick bark.

She started up, forgetting all about the cordial and
her pulse, and was skipping to the front door when
Tippy hurried in from the dining-room and reached
it first. She had a piece of an old coffee sack in
her hand.

&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; she said abruptly to Richard,
who was so surprised at the sudden opening of the
door that he nearly fell in against her.

&ldquo;You catch that dog and hold him while I wipe
his feet. I can&rsquo;t have any dirty quadruped like
that, tracking up my clean floors.&rdquo;

Georgina looked at the performance in amazement. Tippy
scrubbing away at Captain Kidd&rsquo;s muddy paws
till all four of them were clean, and then actually
letting him come into the house and curl up on the
hearth! Tippy, who never touched dogs except with
the end of a broom! She could scarcely believe what
her own eyes told her. She and Richard must have had
a &ldquo;close call,&rdquo; indeed, closer than either
of them realized, to make such a wonderful change
in Tippy.

And the change was towards Richard, too. She had never
seemed to like him much better than his dog. She blamed
him for taking the cream bottles when they played
pirate, and she thought it made little girls boisterous
and rude to play with boys, and she wondered at Barby&rsquo;s
letting Georgina play with him. Several times she
had done her wondering out loud, so that Georgina
heard her, and wanted to say things back--shocking
things, such as Rosa said to Joseph. But she never
said them. There was always that old silver porringer,
sitting prim and lady-like upon the sideboard.

Things were different to-day. After the dog&rsquo;s
paws were wiped dry Tippy asked Richard how he felt
after the accident, and she asked it as if she really
cared and wanted to know. And she brought in a plate
of early summer apples, the first in the market, and
told him to help himself and put some in his pocket.
And there was the checker-board if they wanted to
play checkers or dominoes. Her unusual concern for
their entertainment impressed Georgina more than anything
else she could have done with the seriousness of the
danger they had been in. She felt very solemn and
important, and thanked Tippy with a sweet, patient
air, befitting one who has just been brought up from
the &ldquo;valley of the shadow.&rdquo;

The moment they were alone Richard began breathlessly:

&ldquo;Say. On the way here I went by that place where
we buried the pouch, and what do you think? The markers
are out of sight and the whole place itself is buried--just
filled up level. What are we going to do about it?&rdquo;

The seriousness of the situation did not impress Georgina
until he added, &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose the person who
lost it comes back for it? Maybe we&rsquo;d be put
in prison.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But nobody knows it&rsquo;s buried except you
and me.&rdquo;

Richard scuffed one shoe against the other and looked
into the fire.

&ldquo;But Aunt Letty says there&rsquo;s no getting
around it, &rsquo;Be sure your sin will find you out,&rsquo;
always. And I&rsquo;m awfully unlucky that way. Seems
to me I never did anything in my life that I oughtn&rsquo;t
to a done, that I didn&rsquo;t get found out. Aunt
Letty has a book that she reads to me sometimes when
I&rsquo;m going to bed, that proves it. Every story
in it proves it. One is about a traveler who murdered
a man, and kept it secret for twenty years. Then he
gave it away, talking in his sleep. And one was a feather
in a boy&rsquo;s coat pocket. It led to its being
found out that he was a chicken thief. There&rsquo;s
about forty such stories, and everyone of them prove
your sin is sure to find you out some time before
you die, even if you cover it up for years and years.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t do any sin,&rdquo; protested
Georgina. &ldquo;We just buried a pouch that the dog
found, to keep it safe, and if a big wind came along
and covered it up so we can&rsquo;t find it, that
isn&rsquo;t our fault. We didn&rsquo;t make the wind
blow, did we?&rdquo;

&ldquo;But there was gold money in that pouch,&rdquo;
insisted Richard, &ldquo;and it wasn&rsquo;t ours,
and maybe the letter was important and we ought to
have turned it over to Dad or Uncle Darcy or the police
or somebody.&rdquo;

Aunt Letty&rsquo;s bedtime efforts to keep Richard&rsquo;s
conscience tender were far more effective than she
had dreamed. He was quoting Aunt Letty now.

&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t want anybody to do _our_
things that way.&rdquo; Then a thought of his own
came to him, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want the police
coming round and taking you off to the lockup, would
you? I saw &rsquo;em take Binney Rogers one time,
just because he broke a window that he didn&rsquo;t
mean to. He was only shying a rock at a sparrow. There
was a cop on each side of him a hold of his arm, and
Binney&rsquo;s mother and sister were following along
behind crying and begging them not to take him something
awful. But all they could say didn&rsquo;t do a speck
of good.&rdquo;

The picture carried weight. In spite of her light
tone Georgina was impressed, but she said defiantly:

&ldquo;Well, nobody saw us do it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the gloomy
answer. &ldquo;Somebody might have been up in the
monument with a spy glass, looking down. There&rsquo;s
always people up there spying around, or out on the
masts in the harbor, and if some sleuth was put on
the trail of that pouch the first thing that would
happen would be he&rsquo;d come across the very person
with the glass. It always happens that way, and I
know, because Binney Rogers has read almost all the
detective stories there is, and he said so.&rdquo;

A feeling of uneasiness began to clutch at Georgina&rsquo;s
interior. Richard spoke so knowingly and convincingly
that she felt a real need for blackberry cordial.
But she said with a defiant little uplift of her chin:

&ldquo;Well, as long as we didn&rsquo;t mean to do
anything wrong, I&rsquo;m not going to get scared
about it. I&rsquo;m just going to bear up and steer
right on, and keep hoping that everything will turn
out all right so hard that it will.&rdquo;

Her &ldquo;line to live by&rdquo; buoyed her up so
successfully for the time being, that Richard, too,
felt the cheerful influence of it, and passed to more
cheerful subjects.

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be in all the papers,&rdquo;
he announced. &ldquo;A reporter called up from Boston
to ask Cousin James how it happened. There&rsquo;s
only been a few cases like ours in the whole United
States. Won&rsquo;t you feel funny to see your name
in the paper? Captain Kidd will have his name in, too.
I heard Cousin James say over the telephone that he
was the hero of the hour; that if he hadn&rsquo;t
given the alarm we wouldn&rsquo;t have been discovered
till it was too late.&rdquo;

Richard did not stay long. The finished portrait was
to be hung in the Art gallery in the Town Hall that
morning and he wanted to be on hand at the hanging.
Later it would be sent to the New York exhibition.

&ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s going to let me go with him when
Mr. Locke comes for him on his yacht. He&rsquo;s going
to take me because I sat still and let him get such
a good picture. It&rsquo;s the best he&rsquo;s ever
done. We&rsquo;ll be gone a week.&rdquo;

&ldquo;When are you going?&rdquo; demanded Georgina.

&ldquo;Oh, in a few days, whenever Mr. Locke comes.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I hope we can find that pouch first,&rdquo;
she answered. Already she was beginning to feel little
and forlorn and left behind. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be
awful lonesome with you and Barby both gone.&rdquo;

Tippy came in soon after Richard left and sat down
at the secretary.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking I ought to write to
your mother and let her know about yesterday&rsquo;s
performance before she has a chance to hear it from
outsiders or the papers. It&rsquo;s a whole week to-day
since she left.&rdquo;

&ldquo;A week,&rdquo; echoed Georgina. &ldquo;Is that
all? It seems a month at least. It&rsquo;s been so
long.&rdquo;

Mrs. Triplett tossed her a calendar from the desk.

&ldquo;Count it up for yourself,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;She left two days before your birthday and
this is the Wednesday after.&rdquo;

While Mrs. Triplett began her letter Georgina studied
the calendar, putting her finger on a date as she
recalled the various happenings of it. Each day had
been long and full. That one afternoon when she and
Richard found the paper in the rifle seemed an age
in itself. It seemed months since they had promised
Belle and Uncle Darcy to keep the secret.

She glanced up, about to say so, then bit her tongue,
startled at having so nearly betrayed the fact of
their having a secret. Then the thought came to her
that Emmett&rsquo;s sin had found him out in as strange
a way as that of the man who talked in his sleep or
the chicken thief to whom the feather clung. It was
one more proof added to the forty in Aunt Letty&rsquo;s
book. Richard&rsquo;s positiveness made a deeper impression
on her than she liked to acknowledge. She shut her
eyes a moment, squinting them up so tight that her
eyelids wrinkled, and hoped as hard as she could hope
that everything would turn out all right.

&ldquo;What on earth is the matter with you, child?&rdquo;
exclaimed Tippy, looking up from her letter in time
to catch Georgina with her face thus screwed into
wrinkles.

Georgina opened her eyes with a start.

&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; was the embarrassed answer.
&ldquo;I was just thinking.&rdquo;



Chapter XVII
In the Keeping of the Dunes

Scarcely had Georgina convinced herself by the calendar
that it had been only one short week since Barby went
away instead of the endlessly long time it seemed,
than a letter was brought in to her.

&ldquo;My Dear Little Rainbow-maker,&rdquo; it began.

&ldquo;You are surely a prism your own self, for you
have made a blessed bright spot in the world for me,
ever since you came into it. I read your letter to
papa, telling all about your birthday and the prism
Uncle Darcy gave you. It cheered him up wonderfully.
I was so proud of you when he said it was a fine letter,
and that he&rsquo;d have to engage you as a special
correspondent on his paper some day.

&ldquo;At first the doctors thought his sight was
entirely destroyed, by the flying glass of the broken
windshield, but now they are beginning to hope that
one eye at least may be saved, and possibly the other.
Papa is very doubtful about it himself, and gets very
despondent at times. He had just been having an especially
blue morning when your letter was brought in, and
he said, when I read it:

&ldquo;&lsquo;That _is_ a good line to live
by, daughter,&rsquo; and he had me get out his volume
of Milton and read the whole sonnet that the line is
taken from. The fact that Milton was blind when he
wrote it made it specially interesting to him.

&ldquo;He and mamma both need me sorely now for a
little while, Baby dear, and if you can keep busy
and happy without me I&rsquo;ll stay away a couple
of weeks longer and help take him home to Kentucky,
but I can&rsquo;t be contented to stay unless you
send me a postal every day. If nothing more is on it
than your name, written by your own little fingers,
it will put a rainbow around my troubles and help
me to be contented away from you.&rdquo;

Georgina spent the rest of the morning answering it.
She had a feeling that she must make up for her father&rsquo;s
neglect as a correspondent, by writing often herself.
Maybe the family at Grandfather Shirley&rsquo;s wouldn&rsquo;t
notice that there was never any letter with a Chinese
stamp on it, addressed in a man&rsquo;s big hand in
Barby&rsquo;s pile of mail, if there were others for
her to smile over.

It had been four months since the last one came. Georgina
had kept careful count, although she had not betrayed
her interest except in the wistful way she watched
Barby when the postman came. It made her throat ache
to see that little shadow of disappointment creep into
Barby&rsquo;s lovely gray eyes and then see her turn
away with her lips pressed together tight for a moment
before she began to hum or speak brightly about something
else. No Chinese letter had come in her absence to
be forwarded.

Georgina wished her father could know how very much
Barby cared about hearing from him. Maybe if his attention
were called to it he would write oftener. If the editor
of a big newspaper like Grandfather Shirley, thought
her letters were good enough to print, maybe her father
might pay attention to one of them. A resolve to write
to him some day began to shape itself in her mind.

She would have been surprised could she have known
that already one of her epistles was on its way to
him. Barby had sent him the &ldquo;rainbow letter.&rdquo;
For Barby had not drawn off silent and hurt when his
letters ceased to come, as many a woman would have
done.

&ldquo;Away off there in the interior he has missed
the mails,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Or the
messenger he trusted may have failed to post his letters,
or he may be ill. I&rsquo;ll not judge him until I
know.&rdquo;

After Georgina&rsquo;s letter came she resolutely
put her forebodings and misgivings aside many a time,
prompted by it to steer onward so steadily that hope
must do as Uncle Darcy said, &ldquo;make rainbows even
of her tears.&rdquo;

Georgina wrote on until dinner time, telling all about
the way she had spent her birthday dollar. After dinner
when the sunshine had dried all traces of the previous
night&rsquo;s rain, she persuaded Tippy that she was
entirely over the effects of the gas, and perfectly
able to go down street and select the picture postals
with which to conduct her daily correspondence.

Richard joined her as she passed the bungalow. They
made a thrilling afternoon for themselves by whispering
to each other whenever any strange-looking person
passed them, &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose _that_ was
the owner of the pouch and he was looking for us.&rdquo;
The dread of their sin finding them out walked like
a silent-footed ghost beside them all the way, making
the two pairs of brown eyes steal furtive glances
at each other now and then, and delicious little shivers
of apprehension creep up and down their backs.

Whether it was the passing of the unseasonable weather
into hot July sunshine again or whether the wild-cat
liniment was responsible, no one undertook to say,
but Mrs. Triplett&rsquo;s rheumatism left her suddenly,
and at a time when she was specially glad to be rid
of it. The Sewing Circle, to which she belonged, was
preparing for a bazaar at the Church of the Pilgrims,
and her part in it would keep her away from home most
of the time for three days.

That is why Georgina had unlimited freedom for a while.
She was left in Belle&rsquo;s charge, and Belle, still
brooding over her troubles, listlessly assented to
anything proposed to her. Belle had been allowed to
go and come as she pleased when she was ten, and she
saw no reason why Georgina was not equally capable
of taking care of herself.

Hardly was Mrs. Triplett out of sight that first morning
when Georgina slipped out of the back gate with a
long brass-handled fire-shovel, to meet Richard out
on the dunes. He brought a hoe, and in his hand was
the little compass imbedded in the nut.

When all was ready, according to Georgina&rsquo;s
instructions, he turned around three times, then facing
the east tossed the compass over his shoulder, saying
solemnly, &ldquo;Brother, go find your brother.&rdquo;
She stood ready to mark the spot when it should fall,
but Captain Kidd was ahead of her and had the nut
in his teeth before she could reach the place where
it had touched the ground. So Richard took the nut
away and held the agitated little terrier by the collar
while Georgina went through the same ceremony.

This time Richard reached the nut before the dog,
and drew a circle around the spot where it had lain.
Then he began digging into the sand with the hoe so
industriously that Captain Kidd was moved to frantic
barking.

&ldquo;Here, get to work yourself and keep quiet,&rdquo;
ordered Richard. &ldquo;Rats! You&rsquo;ll have Cousin
James coming out to see what we&rsquo;re doing, first
thing you know. He thinks something is the matter
now, every time you bark. Rats! I say.&rdquo;

The magic word had its effect. After an instant of
quivering eagerness the dog pounced into the hole
which Richard had started, and sent the sand flying
furiously around him with his active little paws. Georgina
dragged the accumulating piles aside with the fire-shovel
on one side, and Richard plied the hoe on the other.
When the hole grew too deep for Captain Kidd to dig
in longer, Richard stepped in and went deeper. But
it was unsatisfactory work. The shifting sand, dry
as powder at this depth, was constantly caving in
and filling up the space.

They tried making new holes, to the north of the old
one, then to the south, then on the remaining sides.
They were still at it when the whistle at the cold-storage
plant blew for noon. Georgina rubbed a sleeve across
her red, perspiring face, and shook the ends of her
curls up and down to cool her hot neck.

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we can dig any more to-day,&rdquo;
she said wearily. &ldquo;The sun is blistering. I
feel all scorched.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough,&rdquo; confessed Richard.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got to find that pouch.&rdquo;

After a moment&rsquo;s rest, leaning on the hoe-handle,
he had an inspiration. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get Manuel
and Joseph and Rosa to help us. They&rsquo;d dig all
day for a nickel.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t one nickel left,&rdquo; said
Georgina. Then she thought a moment. &ldquo;But I
could bring some jelly-roll. Those Fayals would dig
for eats as quick as they would for money. I&rsquo;ll
tell Belle we&rsquo;re going to have a sort of a picnic
over here and she&rsquo;ll let me bring all that&rsquo;s
left in the cake box.&rdquo;

Richard investigated his pockets. A solitary nickel
was all he could turn out. &ldquo;Two cents for each
of the boys and one for Rosa,&rdquo; he said, but
Georgina shook her head.

&ldquo;Rosa would make trouble if you divided that
way. She&rsquo;d howl till somebody came to see what
was the matter. But we could do this way. The one
who gets the least money gets the most jelly-roll.
We&rsquo;ll wait till the digging is over and then
let them divide it to suit themselves.&rdquo;

By five o&rsquo;clock that afternoon, the compass
had been sent to &ldquo;hunt brother&rdquo; in a hundred
different places, and the hollow circled by the bayberry
bushes and beach plums where the pouch had been hidden
filled with deep holes. Captain Kidd had responded
to the repeated call of &ldquo;Rats&rdquo; until the
magic word had lost all charm for him. Even a dog comes
to understand in time when a fellow creature has &ldquo;an
axe to grind.&rdquo; Finally, he went off and lay
down, merely wagging his tail in a bored way when
any further effort was made to arouse his enthusiasm.

The Fayal children, working valiantly in the trenches,
laid down arms at last and strolled home, their faces
streaked with jelly-roll, and Georgina went wearily
up the beach, dragging her fire-shovel after her.
She felt that she had had enough of the dunes to last
her the rest of her natural lifetime. She seemed to
see piles of sand even when she looked at the water
or when her eyes were shut.

&ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t give up,&rdquo; she said
staunchly as she parted from Richard. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
obliged to find that pouch, so we&rsquo;ve _got_
to keep hope at the prow.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Pity all this good digging has to be wasted,&rdquo;
said Richard, looking around at the various holes.
&ldquo;If it had all been in one place, straight down,
it would have been deep enough to strike a pirate&rsquo;s
chest by this time. I hope they&rsquo;ll fill up before
anybody comes this way to notice them.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Somehow, I&rsquo;m not so anxious as I was
to go off &lsquo;a-piratin&rsquo; so bold,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said Georgina with a tired sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had enough digging to last me forever and always,
amen.&rdquo;

The Fayal children, surfeited with one afternoon of
such effort, and not altogether satisfied as to the
division of wages which had led to war in their midst,
did not come back to the Place of the Pouch next morning,
but Richard and Georgina appeared promptly, albeit
with sore muscles and ebbing enthusiasm. Only stern
necessity and fear of consequences kept them at their
task.

Cousin James had reported that there was a fishing
vessel in that morning with two enormous horse mackerel
in the catch, which were to be cut up and salted at
Railroad wharf. It was deliciously cool down on the
wharf, with the breeze blowing off the water through
the great packing shed, and the white sails scudding
past the open doors like fans. With Mrs. Triplett
busy with the affairs of the Bazaar, it would have
been a wonderful opportunity for Georgina to have
gone loitering along the pier, watching the summer
people start off in motor boats or spread themselves
lazily under flapping sails for a trip around the harbor.

But something of the grim spirit of their ancestors,
typified by the monument looking down on them from
the hill, nerved both Richard and Georgina one more
time to answer to the stern call of Duty.



Chapter XVIII
Found Out

&ldquo;I dreamed about that old pouch last night,&rdquo;
said Richard in one of the intervals of rest which
they allowed themselves.

&ldquo;I dreamed that it belonged to a Chinese man
with crooked, yellow finger-nails a foot long. He
came and stood over my bed and said that because there
was important news in that letter and we buried it,
and kept it from going to where it ought to go, _we_
had to be buried alive. And he picked me up like I
was that nut and tossed me over his shoulder, and
said, &lsquo;Brother, go find your brother.&rsquo;
And I began sinking down in the sand deeper and deeper
until I began to smother.&rdquo;

Georgina made no answer. The dream did not impress
her as being at all terrifying. She had swung her
prism around her neck that morning when she dressed,
and now while she rested she amused herself by flashing
the bars of color across Captain Kidd. Richard resented
her lack of interest.

&ldquo;Well, it may not sound very bad out here in
the daylight, but you ought to have _had_
it. I yelled until Daddy shook me and told me I&rsquo;d
wake up the whole end of town with such a nightmare.
If you&rsquo;d have seen that old Chinaman&rsquo;s
face like a dragon&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;d understand
why I feel that we&rsquo;ve just got to find that
pouch. It&rsquo;s going to get us into some kind of
trouble, certain sure, if we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

Georgina rose to begin digging again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
lucky nobody ever comes this way to see all these
holes,&rdquo; she began, but stopped with her shovel
half lifted. A familiar voice from the circle of bushes
at the top of the dune called down cheerily:

&ldquo;Ship ahoy, mates. What port are you bound for
now? Digging through to China?&rdquo;

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Uncle Darcy!&rdquo; they exclaimed
in the same breath. He came plunging down the side
of the dune before they could recover from their confusion.
There was a pail of blueberries in each hand. He had
been down the state road picking them, and was now
on his way to the Gray Inn to sell them to the housekeeper.
Leaving the pails in a level spot under the shade of
a scrubby bush, he came on to where the children were
standing, and eased himself stiffly down to a seat
on the sand. It amused him to see their evident embarrassment,
and his eyes twinkled as he inquired:

&ldquo;What mischief are you up to now, digging all
those gopher holes?&rdquo;

Neither answered for a moment, then Georgina gulped
and found her voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s--it&rsquo;s
a secret,&rdquo; she managed to say.

&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he answered, growing instantly grave
at the sound of that word. &ldquo;Then I mustn&rsquo;t
ask any questions. We must always keep our secrets.
Sometimes it&rsquo;s a pity though, when one has to
promise to do so. I hope yours isn&rsquo;t the burden
to you that mine is to me.&rdquo;

This was the first time he had spoken to them of the
promise they had made to him and Belle. With a look
all around as if to make certain the coast was clear,
he said:

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been wanting
to say to you children ever since that day you had
the rifle, and now&rsquo;s as good a chance as any.
I want you to know that I never would have promised
what I did if it could have made any possible difference
to Mother. But lately she seems all confused about
Danny&rsquo;s trouble. She seems to have forgotten
there was any trouble except that he went away from
home. For months she&rsquo;s been looking for him
to walk in most any day.

&ldquo;Ever since I gave my word to Belle, I&rsquo;ve
been studying over the right and wrong of it. I felt
I wasn&rsquo;t acting fair to Danny. But now it&rsquo;s
clear in my mind that it _was_ the right
thing to do. I argue it this way. Danny cared so much
about saving Emmett from disgrace and Belle from the
pain of finding it out, that he was willing to give
up his home and good name and everything. Now it wouldn&rsquo;t
be fair to him to make that sacrifice in vain by telling
while it can still be such a death-blow to Emmett&rsquo;s
father and hurt Belle much as ever. She&rsquo;s gone
on all these years fairly worshiping Emmett&rsquo;s
memory for being such a hero.&rdquo;

Uncle Darcy stopped suddenly and seemed to be drawn
far away from them as if he had gone inside of himself
with his own thoughts and forgotten their presence.
Georgina sat and fanned herself with her shade hat.
Richard fumbled with the little compass, rolling it
from one hand to the other, without giving any thought
to what he was doing. Presently it rolled away from
him and Captain Kidd darted after it, striking it with
his forepaws as he landed on it, and thus rolling it
still farther till it stopped at the old man&rsquo;s
feet.

Recalled to his surroundings in this way, Uncle Darcy
glanced at the object indifferently, but something
strangely familiar in its appearance made him lean
closer and give it another look. He picked it up, examining
it eagerly. Then he stood up and gazed all around as
if it had dropped from the sky and he expected to
see the hand that had dropped it.

&ldquo;Where did you get this?&rdquo; he demanded
huskily, in such a queer, breathless way that Richard
thought his day of reckoning had come. His sin had
found him out. He looked at Georgina helplessly.

&ldquo;Yes, tell!&rdquo; she exclaimed, answering
his look.

&ldquo;I--I--just _played_ it was mine,&rdquo;
he began. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause the initials on it are
the same as mine when we play pirate and I&rsquo;m
Dare-devil Dick. I was only going to keep it till
we dug up the pouch again. We were keeping it to help
find the pouch like Tom Sawyer did--&rdquo;

It seemed to Richard that Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s hand,
clutching his shoulder, was even more threatening
than the Chinaman&rsquo;s of his nightmare, and his
voice more imperative.

&ldquo;Tell me! Where did you get it? _That&rsquo;s
my compass!_ I scratched those letters on that
nut. &lsquo;D. D.&rsquo; stands for Dan&rsquo;l Darcy.
I brought it home from my last voyage. &rsquo;Twas
a good-luck nut they told me in the last port I sailed
from. It was one of the first things Danny ever played
with. There&rsquo;s the marks of his first little tooth
under those letters. I gave it to him when he got
old enough to claim it, for the letters were his,
too. He always carried it in his pocket and _he
had it with him when he went away_. For the
love of heaven, child, tell me where you found it?&rdquo;

The hand which clutched Richard&rsquo;s shoulder was
shaking as violently as it had the day the old rifle
gave up its secret, and Richard, feeling the same
unnamable terror he had felt in his nightmare, could
only stammer, &ldquo;I--I don&rsquo;t know. Captain
Kidd found it.&rdquo;

Then all three of them started violently, for a hearty
voice just behind them called out unexpectedly:

&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s all the excitement about?&rdquo;

It was Captain James Milford, who had strolled down
from the bungalow, his hat stuck jauntily on the back
of his head, and his hands in his pockets. A few moments
before he had been scanning the harbor through a long
spy-glass, and happening to turn it towards the dunes
had seen the two children digging diligently with
shovel and hoe.

&ldquo;Looks as if they&rsquo;d started to honey-comb
the whole Cape with holes,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Curious
how many things kids of that age can think of. It might
be well to step down and see what they&rsquo;re about.&rdquo;

He put up the spy-glass and started down, approaching
them on one side as the Towncrier reached them on
the other.

&ldquo;Now for a yarn that&rsquo;ll make their eyes
stand out,&rdquo; he thought with a smile as he saw
the old man sit down on the sand.

&ldquo;Wonder if it would sound as thrilling now as
it did when I was Dick&rsquo;s age. I believe I&rsquo;ll
just slip up and listen to one for old times&rsquo;
sake.&rdquo;

Uncle Darcy let go of Richard&rsquo;s shoulder and
turned to the newcomer appealingly.

&ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; he said with a choke in his voice.
&ldquo;Look at this! The first trace of my boy since
he left me, and they can&rsquo;t tell me where they
got it.&rdquo;

He held out the compass and Mr. Milford took it from
his trembling fingers.

&ldquo;Why, _I_ remember this old trinket,
Uncle Dan&rsquo;l!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Milford. &ldquo;You
let me carry it in my pocket one day when I was no
bigger than Dicky, here, when you took me fishing
with you. I thought it was responsible for my luck,
for I made my first big catch that day. Got a mackerel
that I bragged about all season.&rdquo;

Uncle Darcy seized the man&rsquo;s arm with the same
desperate grip which had held the boy&rsquo;s.

&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to understand!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to tell you
that _Danny_ is mixed up with this in some
way. Either he&rsquo;s been near here or somebody
else has who&rsquo;s seen him. He had this with him
when he went away, I tell you. These children say
they took it out of a pouch that the dog found. Help
me, Jimmy. I can&rsquo;t seem to think--&rdquo;

He sat weakly down on the sand again, his head in
his hands, and Mr. Milford, deeply interested, turned
to the children. His questions called out a confusing
and involved account, told piecemeal by Georgina and
Richard in turn.

&ldquo;Hold on, now, let&rsquo;s get the straight
of this,&rdquo; he interrupted, growing more bewildered
as the story proceeded. &ldquo;What was in the pouch
besides the gold pieces, the other money and this
compass?&rdquo;

&ldquo;A letter with a foreign stamp on it,&rdquo;
answered Richard. &ldquo;I noticed specially, because
I have a stamp almost like it in my album.&rdquo;

On being closely cross-questioned he could not say
positively to what country the stamp belonged. He
thought it was Siam or China. Georgina recalled several
names of towns partially scratched out on the back
of the envelope, and the word Texas. She was sure
of that and of &ldquo;Mass.&rdquo; and of &ldquo;Mrs.
Henry--&rdquo; something or other.

&ldquo;But the inside of the letter,&rdquo; persisted
Mr. Milford. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you try to read that?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Course not,&rdquo; said Georgina, her head
indignantly high. &ldquo;We only looked at each end
of it to see if the person&rsquo;s name was on it,
but it began, &lsquo;Dear friend,&rsquo; and ended,
&lsquo;Your grateful friend Dave.&rsquo;&rdquo;

&ldquo;So the letter was addressed &lsquo;_Mrs_.&rsquo;&rdquo;
began Mr. Milford, musingly, &ldquo;but was in a tobacco
pouch. The first fact argues that a woman lost it,
the last that it was a man.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t smell of tobacco,&rdquo;
volunteered Georgina. &ldquo;It was nice and clean
only where Captain Kidd chewed the string.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I suppose it didn&rsquo;t have any smell at
all,&rdquo; said Mr. Milford, not as if he expected
anyone to remember, but that he happened to think of
it. A slowly dawning recollection began to brighten
in Georgina&rsquo;s eyes.

&ldquo;But it did have a smell,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I remember it perfectly well now. Don&rsquo;t
you know, Richard, when you were untying it at the
top of the steps I said &rsquo;Phew! that makes me
think of the liniment I bought from the wild-cat woman
last night,&rsquo; I had to hold the bottle in my lap
all the time we were at the moving picture show so
I had a chance to get pretty well acquainted with
that smell. And afterwards when we were wrapping the
tin foil around the pouch, getting ready to bury it
we both turned up our noses at the way it smelled.
It seemed stronger when the sun shone on it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;The wild-cat woman,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Milford,
turning on Georgina. &ldquo;Where was she? What did
you have to do with her? Was the dog with you?&rdquo;

Little by little they began to recall the evening,
how they had started to the show with the Fayal family
and turned aside to hear the patent medicine man sing,
how Richard and Georgina had dared each other to touch
the wild-cat&rsquo;s tail through the bars, and how
Georgina in climbing down from the wheel had stumbled
over Captain Kidd whom they thought safely shut up
at home.

&ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;ve found a clue,&rdquo;
said Mr. Milford at last. &ldquo;If anybody in town
had lost it there&rsquo;d have been a notice put up
in the post-office or the owner would have been around
for you to cry it, Uncle Dan&rsquo;l. But if it&rsquo;s
the wild-cat woman&rsquo;s she probably did not discover
her loss till she was well out of town, and maybe
not until she reached her next stopping-place.&rdquo;

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been nothing of the sort posted
on the bulletin board at the post-office,&rdquo; said
the old man. &ldquo;I always glance in at it every
morning.&rdquo;

Mr. Milford looked at him thoughtfully as if considering
something. Then he said slowly:

&ldquo;Uncle Dan&rsquo;l, just how much would it mean
to you to find the owner of that pouch?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why, Jimmy,&rdquo; was the tremulous answer,
&ldquo;if it led to any trace of my boy it would be
the one great hope of my life realized.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You are quite sure that you _want_
to bring him back? That it would be best for all concerned?&rdquo;
he continued meaningly.

There was a silence, then the old man answered with
dignity:

&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking of, and considering
all that&rsquo;s gone before, I&rsquo;m not blaming
you, but I can tell you this, Jimmy Milford. If the
town could know all that I know it&rsquo;d be glad
and proud to have my boy brought back to it.&rdquo;

He smote the fist of one hand into the palm of the
other and looked about like something trapped, seeking
escape.

&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t fair! Him worthy to hold up his head with
the best of them, and me bound not to tell. But I&rsquo;ve
given my promise,&rdquo; he added, shaking his head
slowly from side to side. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;ll
all work out for the best, somehow, in the Lord&rsquo;s
own good time, but I can&rsquo;t seem to see the justice
in it now.&rdquo;

He sat staring dejectedly ahead of him with dim, appealing
eyes.

The younger man took a step forward and laid an arm
across the bent shoulders.

&ldquo;All right, Uncle Dan&rsquo;l,&rdquo; he said
heartily. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything under the
sun I can do to help you I&rsquo;m going to do it,
beginning right now. Come on up to the house and I&rsquo;ll
begin this Sherlock Holmes business by telephoning
down the Cape to every town on it till we locate this
wild-cat liniment wagon, and then we&rsquo;ll get
after it as fast as the best automobile in Provincetown
can take us.&rdquo;



Chapter XIX
Tracing the Liniment Wagon

To Wellfleet, to Orleans, to Chatham went the telephone
call, to Harwichport and then back again to the little
towns on the bay side of the Cape, for the wild-cat
and its keepers did not follow a straight course in
their meanderings. It was some time before Mr. Milford
succeeded in locating them. At last he hung up the
receiver announcing:

&ldquo;They showed in Orleans last night all right,
but it wasn&rsquo;t the road to Chatham they took
out of there this morning. It was to Brewster. We can
easily overtake them somewhere along in that direction
and get back home before dark.&rdquo;

There was one ecstatic moment for Georgina when it
was made clear to her that she was included in that
&ldquo;we&rdquo;; that she was actually to have a share
in an automobile chase like the ones that had thrilled
her in the movies. But that moment was soon over.

&ldquo;I hardly know what to do about leaving Mother,&rdquo;
began Uncle Darcy in a troubled voice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
feeling uncommon poorly to-day--she&rsquo;s in bed
and can&rsquo;t seem to remember anything longer than
you&rsquo;re telling it. Mrs. Saggs came in to sit
with her while I was out blueberrying, but she said
she couldn&rsquo;t stay past ten o&rsquo;clock. She
has company coming.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you get some of the other neighbors
to come in for the few hours you&rsquo;d be away?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Milford. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important you
should follow up this clue yourself.&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, Mrs. Saggs is the only one who keeps Mother
from fretting when I&rsquo;m away from her. Her side
window looks right into our front yard, and ordinarily
it would be enough just for her to call across to her
now and then, but it wouldn&rsquo;t do to-day, Mother
not being as well as common. She&rsquo;d forget where
I was gone and I couldn&rsquo;t bear to have her lying
there frightened and worried and not remembering why
I had left her alone. She&rsquo;s like a child at
times. _You_ know how it is,&rdquo; he said,
turning to Georgina. &ldquo;Not flighty, but just
needing to be soothed and talked to.&rdquo;

Georgina nodded. She knew, for on several occasions
she had sat beside Aunt Elspeth when she was in such
a mood, and had quieted and pleased her with little
songs and simple rhymes. She knew she could do it again
to-day as effectually as Mrs. Saggs, if it wasn&rsquo;t
for giving up that exciting motor chase after the
wild-cat woman. It seemed to her a greater sacrifice
than flesh and blood should be called upon to make.
She sat on the porch step, twirling her prism carelessly
on its pink ribbon while she waited for the machine
to be brought around. Then she climbed into the back
seat with Uncle Darcy and the two pails of blueberries,
while Richard settled himself and Captain Kidd in
front with his Cousin James.

They whirled up to the Gray Inn to leave the blueberries,
and then around down Bradford Street to Fishburn Court
to attempt to explain to Aunt Elspeth. On the way
they passed the Pilgrim monument. Georgina tried not
to look at it, but she couldn&rsquo;t help glancing
up at it from the corner of her eye.

&ldquo;You must,&rdquo; it seemed to say to her.

&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she as silently answered
back.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your duty,&rdquo; it reminded her,
&ldquo;and the idea of a descendant of one of the
Pilgrim Fathers and one of the Minute-men shirking
her duty. A pretty member of the Rainbow Club _you_
are,&rdquo; it scoffed.

They whirled by the grim monster of a monument quickly,
but Georgina felt impelled to turn and look back at
it, her gaze following it up higher and higher, above
the gargoyles, to the tipmost stones which seemed to
touch the sky.

&ldquo;I hate that word Duty,&rdquo; she said savagely
to herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as big and ugly and
as always-in-front-of-you as that old monument. They&rsquo;re
exactly alike. You can&rsquo;t help seeing them no
matter which way you look or how hard you try not
to.&rdquo;

At the gate she tried to put the obnoxious word out
of her mind by leaning luxuriously back in the car
and looking up at the chimney tops while Uncle Darcy
stepped out and went into the house. He came out again
almost immediately, crossed the little front yard and
put his head in at Mrs. Saggs&rsquo; side window.
After a short conversation with her he came out to
the gate and stood irresolutely fingering the latch.

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; he repeated,
his voice even more troubled than before. &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s
asleep now. Mrs. Saggs says she&rsquo;ll go over at
twelve and take her her tea, but--I can&rsquo;t help
feeling I ought not to leave her alone for so long.
Couldn&rsquo;t you manage without me?&rdquo;

And then, Georgina inwardly protesting, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to and I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; found herself stepping
out of the car, and heard her own voice saying sweetly:

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay with Aunt Elspeth, Uncle Darcy.
I can keep her from fretting.&rdquo;

A smile of relief broke over the old man&rsquo;s face
and he said heartily:

&ldquo;Why, of course you can, honey. It never occurred
to me to ask a little lass like you to stop and care
for her, but you can do it better than anybody else,
because Mother&rsquo;s so fond of you.&rdquo;

Neither had it occurred to him or to either of the
others that it was a sacrifice for her to give up
this ride. There was not a word from anyone about
its being a noble thing for her to do. Mr. Milford,
in a hurry to be off, merely nodded his satisfaction
at having the matter arranged so quickly. Uncle Darcy
stepped back to the window for a parting word with
Mrs. Saggs.

&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll keep an ear out for you, Georgina,&rdquo;
he said as he went back to the car. &ldquo;Just call
her if you want her for any reason. There&rsquo;s plenty
cooked in the cupboard for your dinner, and Mrs. Saggs
will tend to Mother&rsquo;s tea when the time comes.
When she wakes up and asks for me best not tell her
I&rsquo;m out of town. Just say I&rsquo;ll be back
bye and bye, and humor her along that way.&rdquo;

And then they were off with a whirr and a clang that
sent the chickens in the road scattering in every
direction. Georgina was left standing by the gate
thinking, &ldquo;What made me do it? What _made_
me do it? I don&rsquo;t want to stay one bit.&rdquo;

The odor of gasoline cleared away and the usual Sabbath-like
stillness settled down over all the court. She walked
slowly across the shady little grass plot to the front
door, hesitated there a moment, then went into the
cottage and took off her hat.

A glance into the dim bedroom beyond showed her Aunt
Elspeth&rsquo;s white head lying motionless on her
pillow. The sight of the quiet sleeper made her feel
appallingly lonesome. It was like being all by herself
in the house to be there with one who made no sound
or movement. She would have to find something to do.
It was only eleven o&rsquo;clock. She tiptoed out into
the kitchen.

The almanac had been left lying on the table. She
looked slowly through it, and was rewarded by finding
something of interest. On the last page was a column
of riddles, and one of them was so good she started
to memorize it so that she could propound it to Richard.
She was sure he never could guess it. Finding it harder
to remember than it seemed at first glance, she decided
to copy it. She did not know where to look for a sheet
of paper, but remembered several paper bags on the
pantry shelves, so she went in search of one. Finding
one with only a cupful of sugar left in it, she tore
off the top and wrote the riddle on that with a stub
of a pencil which she found on the table.

While searching for the bag she took an inventory
of the supplies in the pantry from which she was to
choose her dinner. When she had finished copying the
riddle she went back to them. There were baked beans
and blueberry pie, cold biscuit and a dish of honey.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get my dinner now,&rdquo; she decided,
&ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll be ready to sit with Aunt Elspeth
when her tea comes.&rdquo;

As Georgina went back and forth from table to shelf
it was in unconscious imitation of Mrs. Triplett&rsquo;s
brisk manner. Pattering after that capable housekeeper
on her busy rounds as persistently as Georgina had
done all her life, had taught her to move in the same
way. Presently she discovered that there was a fire
laid in the little wood stove ready to light. The
stove was so small in comparison to the big kitchen
range at home, that it appealed to Georgina as a toy
stove might have done. She stood looking at it thinking
what fun it would be to cook something on it all by
herself with no Tippy standing by to say do this or
don&rsquo;t do the other.

&ldquo;I think I ought to be allowed to have some
fun to make up for my disappointment,&rdquo; she said
to herself as the temptation grew stronger and stronger.

&ldquo;I could cook me an egg. Tippy lets me beat
them but she never lets me break them and I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to break one and let it go plunk into
the pan.&rdquo;

She did not resist the temptation long. There was
the sputter of a match, the puff of a flame, and the
little stove was roaring away so effectively that
one of old Jeremy&rsquo;s sayings rose to her lips.
Jeremy had a proverb for everything.

&ldquo;Little pot, soon hot,&rdquo; she said out loud,
gleefully, and reached into the cupboard for the crock
of bran in which the eggs were kept. Then Georgina&rsquo;s
skill as an actor showed itself again, although she
was not conscious of imitating anyone. In Tippy&rsquo;s
best manner she wiped out the frying-pan, settled
it in a hot place on the stove, dropped in a bit of
butter.

With the assured air of one who has had long practice,
she picked up an egg and gave it a sharp crack on
the edge of the pan, expecting it to part evenly into
halves and its contents to glide properly into the
butter. It looked so alluringly simple and easy that
she had always resented Tippy&rsquo;s saying she would
make a mess of it if she tried to do it. But mess
was the only name which could be given to what poured
out on the top of the stove as her fingers went crashing
through the shell and into the slimy feeling contents.
The broken yolk dripped from her hands, and in the
one instant she stood holding them out from her in
disgust, all the rest of the egg which had gone sliding
over the stove, cooked, scorched and turned to a cinder.

The smell and smoke of the burning egg rose to the
ceiling and filled the room. Georgina sprang to close
the door so that the odor would not rouse Aunt Elspeth,
and then with carving knife and stove-lid lifter, she
scraped the charred remains into the fire.

&ldquo;And it looked _so_ easy,&rdquo; she
mourned. &ldquo;Maybe I didn&rsquo;t whack it quickly
enough. I&rsquo;m going to try again.&rdquo; She felt
into the bran for another egg. This time she struck
the shell so hard that its contents splashed out sideways
with an unexpected squirt and slid to the floor. She
was ready to cry as she wiped up the slippery stuff,
but there came to her mind some verses which Tippy
had taught her long ago. And so determined had Tippy
been for her to learn them, that she offered the inducement
of a string of blue beads. The name of the poem was
&ldquo;Perseverance,&rdquo; and it began:

&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a lesson all should heed--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try, try again.
If at first you don&rsquo;t succeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try, try again.&rdquo;

and it ended,

&ldquo;That which other folks can do
Why with patience may not you?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try, try again.&rdquo;

Tippy sowed that seed the same winter that she taught
Georgina &ldquo;The Landing of the Pilgrims&rdquo;;
but surely, no matter how long a time since then,
Tippy should be held accountable for the after effects
of that planting. If Georgina persevered it was no
more than could be expected considering her rigorous
up-bringing.

Georgina pushed the frying-pan to the back of the
stove where it was cooler, and with her red lips pursed
into a tight line, chose another egg, smote it sharply
on the edge of the pan, thereby cracking it and breaking
the shell into halves. Her thumbs punched through into
the yolk of this one also, but by letting part of
the shell drop with it, she managed to land it all
in the pan. That was better. She fished out the fragment
of shell and took another egg.

This time the feat was accomplished as deftly as an
exoert chef could have done it, and a pleased smile
took the place of the grim determination on Georgina&rsquo;s
face. Elated by her success she broke another egg,
then another and another. It was as easy as breathing
or winking. She broke another for the pure joy of
putting her dexterity to the test once more. Then
she stopped, appalled by the pile of empty shells
confronting her accusingly. She counted them. She had
broken eight-- three-fourths of a setting. What would
Uncle Darcy say to such a wicked waste? She could
burn the shells, but what an awful lot of insides to
dispose of. All mixed up as they were, they couldn&rsquo;t
be saved for cake. There was nothing to do but to
scramble them.

Scramble them she did, and the pan seemed to grow
fuller and fuller as she tossed the fluffy mass about
with a fork. It was fun doing that. She made the most
of this short space of time, and it was over all too
soon. She knew that Aunt Elspeth had grown tired of
eggs early in the summer. There was no use saving
any for her. Georgina herself was not especially fond
of them, but she would have to eat all she could to
keep them from being wasted.

Some time after she rose from the table and looked
at the dish with a feeling of disgust that there could
still be such a quantity left, after she had eaten
so much that it was impossible to enjoy even a taste
of the blueberry pie or the honey. Carrying the dish
out through the back door she emptied it into the
cats&rsquo; pan, fervently wishing that John and Mary
Darcy and old Yellownose could dispose of it all without
being made ill.

Long ago she had learned to do her sums in the sand.
Now she stooped down and with the handle of her spoon
scratched some figures in the path. &ldquo;If twelve
eggs cost thirty cents, how much will eight eggs cost?&rdquo;
That was the sum she set for herself. Only that morning
she had heard Tippy inquire the price of eggs from
the butter-woman, and say they were unusually high
and hard to get because they were so many summer people
in town this season. She didn&rsquo;t know where they
were going to get enough for all the cakes necessary
for the Bazaar.

It took Georgina some time to solve the problem. Then
going back to the kitchen she gathered up all the
shells and dropped them into the fire. Her sacrifice
was costing her far more than she had anticipated.
Somehow, somewhere, she must get hold of twenty cents
to pay for those eggs. Duty again. _Always_
Duty. But for that one horrid word she would be racing
down the road to Brewster in the wake of the wild-cat
woman. She wondered if they had caught up with her
yet.



Chapter XX
Dance of the Rainbow Fairies

Georgina, intent on washing the frying-pan and cleaning
the last vestige of burnt egg from the top of the
stove, did not hear Mrs. Saggs come in at the front
door with Aunt Elspeth&rsquo;s dinner on a tray. Nor
did she hear the murmur of voices that went on while
it was being eaten. The bedroom was in the front of
the house, and the rasping noise she was making as
she scratched away with the edge of an iron spoon,
kept her from hearing anything else. So when the door
into the kitchen suddenly opened it gave her such
a start that she dropped the dishcloth into the woodbox.

Mrs. Saggs sniffed suspiciously. There was something
reproachful in the mere tilt of her nose which Georgina
felt and resented.

&ldquo;I thought I smelled something burning.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pect you did,&rdquo; Georgina answered
calmly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all over now. I was
getting my dinner early, so&rsquo;s I could sit with
Aunt Elspeth afterward.&rdquo;

Mrs. Saggs had both hands full, as she was carrying
her tray, so she could not open the stove to look
in; but she walked over towards it and peered at it
from a closer viewpoint, continuing to sniff. But there
was nothing for her to discover, no clue to the smell.
Everything which Georgina had used was washed and
back in place now. The sharp eyes made a survey of
the kitchen, watching Georgina narrowly as the child,
having rinsed the dishcloth after its fall, leaned
out of the back door to hang it on a bush in the sun,
as Uncle Darcy always did.

&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been taught to be real neat, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; she said in an approving tone which made
Georgina like her better. Then her glance fell on
a work-basket which had been left sitting on top of
the flour barrel. In it was a piece of half-finished
mending. The sharp eyes softened.

&ldquo;I declare!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
downright pitiful the way that old man tries to do
for himself and his poor old wife. It&rsquo;s surprising,
though, how well he gets along with the housework
and taking care of her and all.&rdquo;

She glanced again at the needle left sticking in the
clumsy unfinished seam, and recognized the garment.

&ldquo;Well, I wish you&rsquo;d look at that! Even
trying to patch her poor old nightgown for her! Can
you beat that? Here, child, give it to me. My hands
are full with this tray, so just stick it under my
arm. I&rsquo;ll mend it this afternoon while I&rsquo;m
setting talking to the company.&rdquo;

She tightened her grip on the bundle which Georgina
thrust under her arm, and looked down at it.

&ldquo;Them pitiful old stiff fingers of his&rsquo;n!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;They sure make a botch of sewing,
but they don&rsquo;t ever make a botch of being kind.
Well, I&rsquo;m off now. Guess you&rsquo;d better
run in and set with Mis&rsquo; Darcy for a spell,
for she&rsquo;s waked up real natural and knowing now,
and seems to crave company.&rdquo;

Georgina went, but paused on the way, seeing the familiar
rooms in a new light, since Mrs. Saggs&rsquo; remarks
had given her new and illuminating insight. Everywhere
she looked there was something as eloquent as that
bit of unfinished mending to bear witness that Uncle
Darcy was far more than just a weather-beaten old
man with a smile and word of cheer for everybody.
Ringing the Towncrier&rsquo;s bell and fishing and
blueberrying and telling yarns and helping everybody
bear their trouble was the least part of his doings.
That was only what the world saw. That was all she
had seen herself until this moment.

Now she was suddenly aware of his bigness of soul
which made him capable of an infinite tenderness and
capacity to serve. His devotion to Aunt Elspeth spread
an encircling care around her as a great oak throws
the arms of its shade, till her comfort was his constant
thought, her happiness his greatest desire.

&ldquo;Them pitiful, old, stiff fingers of his&rsquo;n!&rdquo;
How could Mrs. Saggs speak of them so? They were heroic,
effectual fingers. Theirs was something far greater
than the Midas touch--they transmuted the smallest
service into Love&rsquo;s gold.

Georgina, with her long stretching up to books that
were &ldquo;over her head,&rdquo; understood this
without being able to put it into words. Nor could
she put into words the longing which seized her like
a dull ache, for _Barby_ to be loved and
cared for like that, to be as constantly and supremely
considered. She couldn&rsquo;t understand how Aunt
Elspeth, old and wrinkled and childish, could be the
object of such wonderful devotion, and Barby, her
adorable, winsome Barby, call forth less.

&ldquo;Not one letter in four long months,&rdquo;
she thought bitterly.

&ldquo;Dan&rsquo;l,&rdquo; called Aunt Elspeth feebly
from the next room, and Georgina went in to assure
her that Uncle Darcy was _not_ out in the
boat and would not be brought home drowned. He was
attending to some important business and would be
back bye and bye. In the meantime, she was going to
hang her prism in the window where the sun could touch
it and let the rainbow fairies dance over the bed.

The gay flashes of color, darting like elfin wings
here and there as Georgina twisted the ribbon, pleased
Aunt Elspeth as if she were a child. She lifted a
thin, shriveled hand to catch at them and gave a weak
little laugh each time they eluded her grasp. It was
such a thin hand, almost transparent, with thick,
purplish veins standing out on it. Georgina glanced
at her own and wondered if Aunt Elspeth&rsquo;s ever
could have been dimpled and soft like hers. It did
not seem possible that this frail old woman with the
snowy-white hair and sunken cheeks could ever have
been a rosy child like herself. As if in answer to
her thought, Aunt Elspeth spoke, groping again with
weak, ineffectual passes after the rainbows.

&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t catch them. They bob around so.
That&rsquo;s the way I used to be, always on the move.
They called me &lsquo;Bouncing Bet!&rsquo;&rdquo;

&ldquo;Tell me about that time,&rdquo; urged Georgina.
Back among early memories Aunt Elspeth&rsquo;s mind
walked with firm, unfailing tread. It was only among
those of later years that she hesitated and groped
her way as if lost in fog. By the time the clock had
struck the hours twice more Georgina felt that she
knew intimately a mischievous girl whom her family
called Bouncing Bet for her wild ways, but who bore
no trace of a resemblance to the feeble old creature
who recounted her pranks.

And the blue-eyed romp who could sail a boat like
a boy or swim like a mackerel grew up into a slender
slip of a lass with a shy grace which made one think
of a wild-flower. At least that is what the old daguerreotype
showed Georgina when Aunt Elspeth sent her rummaging
through a trunk to find it. It was taken in a white
dress standing beside a young sailor in his uniform.
No wonder Uncle Darcy looked proud in the picture.
But Georgina never would have known it was Uncle Darcy
if she hadn&rsquo;t been told. He had changed, too.

The picture make Georgina think of one of Barby&rsquo;s
songs, and presently when Aunt Elspeth was tired of
talking she sang it to her:

&ldquo;Hand in hand when our life was May.
Hand in hand when our hair is gray.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow and sun for everyone
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the years roll on.
Hand in hand when the long night tide
Gently covers us side by side------
Ah, lad, though we know not when,
Love will be with us forever then.
Always the same, Darby my own,
Always the same to your old wife Joan!&rdquo;

After that there were other songs which Aunt Elspeth
asked for, &ldquo;Oh, wert thou in the cauld blast,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Robin Adair.&rdquo; Then came a long tiresome
pause when Georgina didn&rsquo;t know what to do next,
and Aunt Elspeth turned her head restlessly on the
pillow and seemed uneasy.

Georgina wished with all her heart she was out of
the stuffy little bedroom. If she had gone with the
others, she would be speeding along the smooth, white
road now, coming home from Brewster, with the wind
and sunshine of all the wide, free outdoors around
her.

Aunt Elspeth drew a long, tired sigh.

&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d like me to read to you,&rdquo;
ventured Georgina. She hesitated over making such
an offer, because there were so few books in the house.
Nothing but the almanac looked interesting. Aunt Elspeth
assented, and pointed out a worn little volume of
devotions on top of the bureau, saying:

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Dan&rsquo;l reads me on Sundays.&rdquo;

Georgina opened it. Evidently it had been compiled
for the use of sea-faring people, for it was full
of the promises that sailor-folk best understand;
none of the shepherd psalms or talk of green pastures
and help-giving hills. It was all about mighty waters
and paths through the deep. She settled herself comfortably
in the low rocking-chair beside the bed, tossed back
her curls and was about to begin, when one of the
rainbow lights from the prism danced across the page.
She waited, smiling, until it glimmered away. Then
she read the verses on which it had shone.

_"All thy waves and thy billows are gone over
me, yet the Lord will command His loving kindness
in the daytime, and in the night His song shall be
with me."_

The sweet little voice soothed the troubled spirit
that listened like music.

_"When thou passeth through the waters I will
be with thee, and through the rivers: they shall not
overflow thee.... Thus saith the Lord which maketh
a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters."_

Aunt Elspeth reached out a groping hand for Georgina&rsquo;s
and took the soft little fingers in hers. Georgina
didn&rsquo;t want to have her hand held, especially
in such a stiff, bony clasp. It made her uncomfortable
to sit with her arm stretched up in such a position,
but she was too polite to withdraw it, so she read
on for several pages.

_"He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves
thereof are still. So He bringeth them into their
desired haven."_

Attracted by the sound of heavy breathing, she looked
up. Aunt Elspeth was asleep. Georgina laid the book
on the table, and slowly, very slowly began to raise
herself out of the chair, afraid of arousing the sleeper
who still held her hand. As she stood up, the board
in the floor under her squeaked. She was afraid to
take another step or to try to pull her hand away.
She had come to the end of her resources for entertainment,
and she was afraid Aunt Elspeth&rsquo;s next awakening
might be to a crying, restless mood which she could
not control. So she sat down again.

It was very still in the bedroom. A fly buzzed on
the outside of the window screen, and away off on
another street the &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; was
going by. She could hear the bells jingling on the
horses. As she sat thus, not even rocking, but just
jiggling the chair a trifle, the words she had read
began to come back to her after a while like a refrain:
&ldquo;So He bringeth them into their desired haven.
So He bringeth them into their desired haven.&rdquo;
She whispered them over and over as she often whispered
songs, hearing the music which had no tone except in
her thought.

And presently, as the whispered song repeated itself,
the words began to bring a wonderful sense of peace
and security. She did not realize what it was that
was speaking to her through them. It was the faith
which had lived so long in these lowly little rooms.
It was the faith which had upborne Uncle Darcy year
after year, helping him to steer onward in the confidence
that the Hand he trusted would fulfil all its promises.
She felt the subtle influence that goes out from such
lives, without knowing what it was that touched her.
She was conscious of it only as she was conscious
of the nearness of mignonette when its fragrance stole
in from the flower-bed under the window. They were
both unseen but the mignonette&rsquo;s fragrance was
wonderfully sweet, and the feeling of confidence,
breathing through the words of the old psalm was wonderfully
strong. Some day she, too, would be brought, and Barby
would he brought into &ldquo;their desired haven.&rdquo;

Georgina was tired. It had been a full day, beginning
with that digging in the dunes. Presently she began
to nod. Then the rocking chair ceased to sway. When
the clock struck again she did not hear it. She was
sound asleep with her hand still clasped in Aunt Elspeth&rsquo;s.

Chapter XXI
On the Trail of the Wild-Cat Woman

Meanwhile, the pursuing party had made the trip to
Brewster and were on their way home. At the various
small towns where they stopped to ask questions, they
found that the patent-medicine vendors had invariably
followed one course. They had taken supper at the hotel,
but after each evening&rsquo;s performance had driven
into the country a little way to camp for the night,
in the open. At Orleans an acquaintance of Mr. Milford&rsquo;s
in a feed store had much to say about them.

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether they camp out of
consideration for the wild-cat, or whether it&rsquo;s
because they&rsquo;re attached to that rovin&rsquo;,
gypsy life. They&rsquo;re good spenders, and from
the way they sold their liniment here last night,
you&rsquo;d think they could afford to put up at a
hotel all the time and take a room for the cat in
the bargain. You needn&rsquo;t tell me that beast ever
saw the banks of the Brazos. I&rsquo;ll bet they caught
it up in the Maine woods some&rsquo;rs. But they seem
such honest, straightforward sort of folks, somehow
you have to believe &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re a friendly
pair, too, specially the old lady. Seems funny to
hear you speak of her as the wild-cat woman. That
name is sure a misfit for her.&rdquo;

Mr. Milford thought so himself, when a little later
he came across her, a mile out of Brewster. She was
sitting in the wooden rocking chair in one end of
the ivagon, placidly darning a pair of socks, while
she waited for her husband to bring the horses from
some place up in the woods where he had taken them
for water. They had been staked by the roadside all
night to graze. The wild-cat was blinking drowsily
in its cage, having just been fed.

Some charred sticks and a little pile of ashes by
the roadside, showed where she had cooked dinner over
a camp-fire, but the embers were carefully extinguished
and the frying pan and dishes were stowed out of sight
in some mysterious compartment under the wagon bed,
as compactly as if they had been parts of a Chinese
puzzle. Long experience on the road had taught her
how to pack with ease and dexterity.

She looked up with interest as the automobile drew
out of the road, and stopped alongside the wagon.
She was used to purchasers following them out of town
for the liniment after a successful show like last
night&rsquo;s performance.

Despite the feedman&rsquo;s description of her, Mr.
Milford had expected to see some sort of an adventuress
such as one naturally associates with such a business,
and when he saw the placid old lady with the smooth,
gray hair, and met the gaze of the motherly eyes peering
over her spectacles at him, he scarcely knew how to
begin. Uncle Darcy, growing impatient at the time
consumed in politely leading up to the object of their
coming, fidgetted in his seat. At last he could wait
no longer for remarks about weather and wild-cats.
Such conversational paths led nowhere. He interrupted
abruptly.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Towncrier from Provincetown,
ma&rsquo;am. Did you lose anything while you were
there?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; she began slowly. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t say where I lost it. I didn&rsquo;t think
it was in Provincetown though. I made sure it was some
place between Harwichport and Orleans, and I had my
man post notices in both those places.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And what was it you lost?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Milford politely. He had cautioned his old friend
on the way down at intervals of every few miles, not
to build his hopes up too much on finding that this
woman was the owner of the pouch.

&ldquo;You may have to follow a hundred different
clues before you get hold of the right one,&rdquo;
he warned him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking this trip
on the mere chance that we&rsquo;ll find the owner,
just because two children associated the pouch in
their memory with the odor of liniment. It is more
than likely they&rsquo;re mistaken and that this is
all a wild-goose chase.&rdquo;

But Uncle Darcy _had_ built his hopes on
it, had set his heart on finding this was the right
clue, and his beaming face said, &ldquo;I told you
so,&rdquo; when she answered:

&ldquo;It was a little tobacco pouch, and I&rsquo;m
dreadfully put out over losing it, because aside from
the valuables and keep-sakes in it there was a letter
that&rsquo;s been following me all over the country.
It didn&rsquo;t reach me till just before I got to
Provincetown. It&rsquo;s from some heathen country
with such an outlandish name I couldn&rsquo;t remember
it while I was reading it, scarcely, and now I&rsquo;ll
never think of it again while the world wags, and
there&rsquo;s no way for me to answer it unless I do.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Uncle Darcy. &ldquo;You _must_ think of
it. And I _must_ know. How did this come
into your hands?&rdquo;

He held out the little watch-fob charm, the compass
set in a nut and she seized it eagerly.

&ldquo;Well, you did find my pouch, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;I made sure that was what you
were aiming to tell me. That&rsquo;s a good-luck charm.
It was given to me as much as eight years ago, by
a young fellow who was taken sick on our ranch down
in Texas. He&rsquo;d been working around the docks
in Galveston, but came on inland because somebody roped
him in to believe he could make a fortune in cattle
in a few months. He was riding fences for Henry, and
he came down with a fever and Henry and me nursed him
through.&rdquo;

Always talkative, she poured out her information now
in a stream, drawn on by the compelling eagerness
of the old man&rsquo;s gaze.

&ldquo;He was a nice boy and the most grateful soul
you ever saw. But he didn&rsquo;t take to the cattle
business, and he soon pushed on. He was all broke up
when it came to saying good-bye. You could see that,
although he&rsquo;s one of your quiet kind, hiding
his real feelings like an Indian. He gave me this
good-luck charm when he left, because he didn&rsquo;t
have anything else to give, to show he appreciated
our nursing him and doing for him, and he said that
he&rsquo;d _make_ it bring us good luck or
die a-trying and we&rsquo;d hear from him some of
these days.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And you did?&rdquo;

The old man&rsquo;s face was twitching with eagerness
as he asked the question.

&ldquo;Yes, about five years ago he sent us a nice
little check at Christmas. Said he had a good job
with a wealthy Englishman who spent his time going
around the world discovering queer plants and writing
books about them. He was in South America then. We&rsquo;ve
heard from him several times since. This last letter
followed me around from pillar to post, always just
missing me and having to have the address scratched
out and written over till you could hardly make head
or tail of what was on it.

&ldquo;He asked me to write to the address he gave
me, but whether it was in &lsquo;Afric&rsquo;s sunny
fountain or India&rsquo;s coral strand,&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t
tell now. It was some heathenish &lsquo;land in error&rsquo;s
chain,&rsquo; as the missionary hymn says. I was so
worried over losing the letter on account of the address,
for he did seem so bent on hearing from us, and he&rsquo;s
a nice boy. I&rsquo;d hate to loose track of him.
So I&rsquo;m mighty thankful you found the pouch.&rdquo;

She stopped, expecting them to hand it over. Mr. Milford
made the necessary explanation. He told of Captain
Kidd finding it and bringing it home, of the two children
burying it in play and the storm sweeping away every
trace of the markers. While he told the story several
automobiles passed them and the occupants leaned out
to look at the strange group beside the road. It was
not every day one could see an old lady seated in
a rocking chair in one end of an unattached wagon with
a wild-cat in the other. These passing tourists would
have thought it stranger still, could they have known
how fate had been tangling the life threads of these
people who were in such earnest conversation, or how
it had wound them together into a queer skein of happenings.

&ldquo;And the only reason this compass was saved,&rdquo;
concluded Mr. Milford, &ldquo;was because it had the
initials &lsquo;D. D.&rsquo; scratched on it, which
stands for this little boy&rsquo;s name when he plays
pirate--Dare-devil Dick.&rdquo;

The motherly eyes smiled on Richard &ldquo;If you
want to know the real name those letters stand for,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Dave Daniels. That&rsquo;s
the name of the boy who gave it to me.&rdquo;

Richard looked alarmed, and even Mr. Milford turned
with a questioning glance towards Uncle Darcy, about
to say something, when the old man leaned past him
and spoke quickly, almost defiantly, as a child might
have done.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I don&rsquo;t care
what he told you his name was. He had a good reason
for changing it. And I&rsquo;m going to tell you this
much no matter what I promised. _I_ scratched
those initials on there my own self, over forty years
ago. And the boy who gave it to you _is_
named Daniel, but it&rsquo;s his first name, same as
mine. Dan&rsquo;l Darcy. And the boy&rsquo;s mine,
and I&rsquo;ve been hunting him for ten long years,
and I&rsquo;ve faith to believe that the good Lord
isn&rsquo;t going to disappoint me now that I&rsquo;m
this near the end of my hunt. He had a good reason
for going away from home the way he did. He&rsquo;d
a good reason for changing his name as he did, but
the time has come now when it&rsquo;s all right for
him to come back and,&rdquo; shaking his finger solemnly
and impressively at the woman, &ldquo;_I want you
to get that word back to him without fail_.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But this is only circumstantial evidence, Uncle
Dan&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Mr. Milford, soothingly.
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any real proof that this Dave
is your Danny.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Proof, proof,&rdquo; was the excited answer.
&ldquo;I tell you, man, I&rsquo;ve all the proof I
need. All I ask for is the address in that letter.
I&rsquo;ll find my boy quick enough.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was all the
woman could answer. &ldquo;The only way in the world
to find it is to dig up that pouch.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But even if you can&rsquo;t remember the new
address tell me one of the old ones,&rdquo; he pleaded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance on writing there and
having it forwarded.&rdquo;

But the woman could not recall the name of a single
city. South America, Australia, New Zealand, she remembered
he had been in those countries, but that was all.
Richard, upon being cross-questioned again, &ldquo;b&rsquo;leeved&rdquo;
the stamp was from Siam or China but couldn&rsquo;t
be certain which.

&ldquo;Here comes Henry!&rdquo; exclaimed the woman
in a relieved tone. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll remember.&rdquo;

Henry, a tall, raw-boned man with iron-gray hair under
his Texas sombrero, in his shirt sleeves and with
his after-dinner pipe still in his mouth, came leisurely
out of the woods, leading the horses. They were already
harnessed, ready to be hitched to the wagon. He backed
them up to the tongue and snapped the chains in place
before he paused to give the strangers more than a
passing nod of greeting. Then he came around to the
side of the wagon nearest the machine, and putting
one foot up on a spoke of his front wheel, leaned
over in a listening attitude, while the whole story
was repeated for his benefit.

&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re his father,&rdquo; he said
musingly, looking at Uncle Darcy with shrewd eyes
that were used to appraising strangers.

&ldquo;Who ever would a thought of coming across Dave
Daniels&rsquo; tracks up here on old Cape Cod? You
look like him though. I bet at his age you were as
much alike as two peas in a pod. I never did know where
he hailed from. He was a close-mouthed chap. But I
somehow got the idea he must have been brought up
near salt water. He talked so much sailor lingo.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Put on your thinking-cap, Henry,&rdquo; demanded
his wife. &ldquo;The gentlemen wants to know where
that last letter was written from, what the postmark
was, or the address inside, or what country the stamp
belonged to. And if you don&rsquo;t know that, what
are some of the other places he wrote to us from?&rdquo;

&ldquo;You&rsquo;re barking up the wrong tree when
you ask _me_ any such questions,&rdquo;
was the only answer he could give. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
pay any attention to anything but the reading matter.&rdquo;

Questions, surmises, suggestions, everything that
could be brought up as aids to memory were of no avail.
Henry&rsquo;s memory was a blank in that one important
particular. Finally, Mr. Milford took two five-dollar
gold pieces out of his pocket and a handful of small
change which he dropped into the woman&rsquo;s lap
despite her protests.

&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll square up the damage the children
did as far as possible,&rdquo; he said with a laugh.
&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t get the letter back until
the wind is ready to turn the dunes topsy-turvy again.
That may be in years and it may be never. Let me have
your address and if ever it is found it shall be sent
directly back to you, and the children can inherit
the money if I&rsquo;m not here to claim it.&rdquo;

The man made a wry face at mention of his address.
&ldquo;We sort of belong to what they call the floating
population now. Home with us means any old place where
Mother happens to set her rocking chair. We&rsquo;ve
turned the ranch over to my daughter and her husband
while we see something of the world, and as long as
things go as smoothly as they do, we&rsquo;re in no
great shakes of a hurry to get back.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But the ranch address will always find us,
Henry,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Write it down for
the gentlemen. Ain&rsquo;t this been a strange happening?&rdquo;
she commented, as she received Mr. Milford&rsquo;s
card in return with the Towncrier&rsquo;s name penciled
on the back. She looked searchingly at Richard.

&ldquo;I remember you, now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There
was such a pretty little girl with you--climbed up
on the wagon to touch Tim&rsquo;s tail through the
bars. She had long curls and a smile that made me
want to hug her. She bought a bottle of liniment,
I remember, and I&rsquo;ve thought of her a dozen times
since then, thought how a little face like that brightens
up all the world around it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That was Georgina Huntingdon,&rdquo; volunteered
Richard.

&ldquo;Well, now, that&rsquo;s a pretty name. Write
it down on the other side of this piece of paper,
sonny, and yours, too. Then when I go about the country
I&rsquo;ll know what to call you when I think about
you. This is just like a story. If there was somebody
who knew how to write it up &rsquo;twould make a good
piece for the papers, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;

They were ready to start back now, since there was
no more information to be had, but on one pretext
or another Uncle Darcy delayed. He was so pitifully
eager for more news of Danny. The smallest crumb about
the way he looked, what he did and said was seized
upon hungrily, although it was news eight years old.
And he begged to hear once more just what it was Danny
had said about the Englishman, and the work they were
doing together. He could have sat there the rest of
the day listening to her repeat the same things over
and over if he had had his wish. Then she asked a
question.

&ldquo;Who is Belle? I mind when he was out of his
head so long with the fever he kept saying, &rsquo;_Belle_
mustn&rsquo;t suffer. No matter what happens _Belle_
must be spared.&rsquo; I remembered because that&rsquo;s
my name, and hearing it called out in the dead of
night the way a man crazy with fever would call it,
naturally makes you recollect it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That was just a friend of his,&rdquo; answered
Uncle Darcy, &ldquo;the girl who was going to marry
his chum.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was the answer in a tone which seemed
to convey a shade of disappontment. &ldquo;I thought
maybe--&rdquo;

She did not finish the sentence, for the engine had
begun to shake noisily, and it seemed to distract
her thoughts. And now there being really nothing more
to give them an excuse for lingering they said goodbye
to their wayside acquaintances, feeling that they were
parting from two old friends, so cordial were the
good wishes which accompanied the leave-taking.



Chapter XXII
The Rainbow Game

With her arm stiff and cramped from being held so
long in one position, Georgina waked suddenly and
looked around her in bewilderment. Uncle Darcy was
in the room, saying something about her riding home
in the machine. He didn&rsquo;t want to hurry her
off, but Mr. Milford was waiting at the gate, and
it would save her a long walk home----.

While he talked he was leaning over Aunt Elspeth,
patting her cheek, and she was clinging to his hand
and smiling up at him as if he had just been restored
to her after a long, long absence, instead of a separation
of only a few hours. And he looked so glad about something,
as if the nicest thing in the world had happened,
that Georgina rubbed her eyes and stared at him, wondering
what it could have been.

Evidently, it was the honk of the horn which had aroused
Georgina, and when it sounded again she sprang up,
still confused by the suddenness of her awakening,
with only one thing clear in her mind, the necessity
for haste. She snatched her prism from the window
and caught up her hat as she ran through the next
room, but not until she was half-way home did she
remember that she had said nothing about the eggs and
had asked no questions about the trip to Brewster.
She had not even said good-bye.

Mr. Milford nodded pleasantly when she went out to
the car, saying, &ldquo;Hop in, kiddie,&rdquo; but
he did not turn around after they started and she did
not feel well enough acquainted with him to shout out
questions behind his back. Besides, after they had
gone a couple of blocks he began explaining something
to Richard, who was sitting up in front of him, about
the workings of the car, and kept on explaining all
the rest of the way home. She couldn&rsquo;t interrupt.

Not until she climbed out in front of her own gate
with a shy &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Milford, for bringing
me home,&rdquo; did she find courage and opportunity
to ask the question she longed to know.

&ldquo;Did you find the woman? _Was_ it
her pouch?&rdquo;

Mr. Milford was leaning forward in his seat to examine
something that had to do with the shifting of the
gears, and he answered while he investigated, without
looking up.

&ldquo;Yes, but she couldn&rsquo;t remember where
the letter was from, so we&rsquo;re not much wiser
than we were before, except that we know for a certainty
that Dan was alive and well less than two months ago.
At least Uncle Dan&rsquo;l believes it is Dan. The
woman calls him Dave, but Uncle Dan&rsquo;l vows they&rsquo;re
one and the same.&rdquo;

Having adjusted the difficulty, Mr. Milford, with
a good-bye nod to Georgina, started on down the street
again. Georgina stood looking after the rapidly disappearing
car.

&ldquo;Well, no wonder Uncle Darcy looked so happy,&rdquo;
she thought, recalling his radiant face. &ldquo;It
was knowing that Danny is alive and well that made
it shine so. I wish I&rsquo;d been along. Wish I could
have heard every thing each one of them said. I could
have remembered every single word to tell Richard,
but he won&rsquo;t remember even half to tell me.&rdquo;

It was in the pursuit of all the information which
could be pumped out of Richard that Georgina sought
the Green Stairs soon after breakfast next morning.
Incidentally, she was on her way to a nearby grocery
and had been told to hurry. She ran all the way down
in order to gain a few extra moments in which to loiter.
As usual at this time of morning, Richard was romping
over the terraces with Captain Kidd.

&ldquo;Hi, Georgina,&rdquo; he called, as he spied
her coming. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a new game. A new
way to play tag. Look.&rdquo;

Plunging down the steps he held out for her inspection
a crystal paperweight which he had picked up from
the library table. Its round surface had been cut
into many facets, as a diamond is cut to make it flash
the light, and the spots of color it threw as he turned
it in the sun were rainbow-hued.

&ldquo;See,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Instead of
tagging Captain Kidd with my hand I touch him with
a rainbow, and it&rsquo;s lots harder to do because
you can&rsquo;t always make it light where you want
it to go, or where you think it is going to fall.
I&rsquo;ve only tagged him twice so far in all the
time I&rsquo;ve been trying, because he bobs around
so fast. Come on, I&rsquo;ll get you before you tag
me,&rdquo; he added, seeing that her prism hung from
the ribbon on her neck.

She did not wear it every day, but she had felt an
especial need for its comforting this morning, and
had put it on as she slowly dressed. The difficulty
of restoring the eggs loomed up in front of her as
a real trouble, and she needed this to remind her
to keep on hoping that some way would soon turn up
to end it.

It was a fascinating game. Such tags are elusive,
uncertain things. The pursuer can never be certain
of touching the pursued. Georgina entered into it,
alert and glowing, darting this way and that to escape
being touched by the spots of vivid color. Her prism
threw it in bars, Richard&rsquo;s in tiny squares
and triangles.

&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make them fight!&rdquo; Richard
exclaimed in the midst of it, and for a few moments
the color spots flashed across each other like flocks
of darting birds. Suddenly Georgina stopped, saying:

&ldquo;Oh, I forgot. I&rsquo;m on my way to the grocery,
and I must hurry back. But I wanted to ask you two
things. One was, tell me all about what the woman
said yesterday, and the other was, think of some way
for me to earn twenty cents. There isn&rsquo;t time
to hear about the first one now, but think right quick
and answer the second question.&rdquo;

She started down the street, skipping backwards slowly,
and Richard walked after her.

&ldquo;Aw, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered
in a vague way. &ldquo;At home when we wanted to make
money we always gave a show and charged a penny to
get in, or we kept a lemonade stand; but we don&rsquo;t
know enough kids here to make that pay.&rdquo;

Then he looked out over the water and made a suggestion
at random. A boy going along the beach towards one
of the summer cottages with a pail in his hand, made
him think of it.

&ldquo;Pick blueberries and sell them.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; answered Georgina,
still progressing towards the grocery backward. &ldquo;And
it would be a good time now to slip away while Tippy&rsquo;s
busy with the Bazaar. This is the third day. But they&rsquo;ve
done so well they&rsquo;re going to keep on with it
another day, and they&rsquo;ve thought up a lot of
new things to-morrow to draw a crowd. One of them is
a kind of talking tableau. I&rsquo;m to be in it,
so it wouldn&rsquo;t do for me to go and get my hands
all stained with berries when I&rsquo;m to be dressed
up as a part of the show for the whole town to come
and take a look at me.&rdquo;

Richard had no more suggestions to offer, so with
one more flash of the prism and a cry of &ldquo;last
tag,&rdquo; Georgina turned and started on a run to
the grocery. Richard and the paperweight followed in
hot pursuit.

Up at one of the front windows of the bungalow, two
interested spectators had been watching the game below.
One was Richard&rsquo;s father, the other was a new
guest of Mr. Milford&rsquo;s who had arrived only the
night before. He was the Mr. Locke who was to take
Richard and his father and Cousin James away on his
yacht next morning. He was also a famous illustrator
of juvenile books, and he sometimes wrote the rhymes
and fairy tales himself which he illustrated. Everybody
in this town of artists who knew anything at all of
the world of books and pictures outside, knew of Milford
Norris Locke. Now as he watched the graceful passes
of the two children darting back and forth on the
board-walk below, he asked:

&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the little girl, Moreland? She&rsquo;s
the child of my dreams--the very one I&rsquo;ve been
hunting for weeks. She has not only the sparkle and
spirit that I want to put into those pictures I was
telling you about, but the grace and the curls and
the mischievous eyes as well. Reckon I could get her
to pose for me?&rdquo;

That is how it came about that Georgina found Richard&rsquo;s
father waiting for her at the foot of the Green Stairs
when she came running back from the grocery. When
she went home a few minutes later, she carried with
her something more than the cake of sweet chocolate
that Tippy had sent her for in such a hurry. It was
the flattering knowledge that a famous illustrator
had asked to make a sketch of her which would be published
in a book if it turned out to be a good one.

With a sailing party and a studio reception and several
other engagements to fill up his one day in Provincetown,
Mr. Locke could give only a part of the morning to
the sketches, and wanted to begin as soon as possible.
So a few minutes after Georgina went dancing in with
the news, he followed in Mr. Milford&rsquo;s machine.
He arrived so soon after, in fact, that Tippy had
to receive him just as she was in her gingham house
dress and apron.

After looking all over the place he took Georgina
down to the garden and posed her on a stone bench
near the sun-dial, at the end of a tall, bright aisle
of hollyhocks. There was no time to waste.

&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pretend you&rsquo;re sitting on
the stone rim of a great fountain in the King&rsquo;s
garden,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying
to find some trace of the beautiful Princess who has
been bewitched and carried away to a castle under
the sea, that had &lsquo;a ceiling of amber, a pavement
of pearl.&rsquo;&rdquo;

Georgina looked up, delighted that he had used a line
from a poem she loved. It made her feel as if he were
an old friend.

&ldquo;This is for a fairy tale that has just begun
to hatch itself out in my mind, so you see it isn&rsquo;t
all quite clear yet. There&rsquo;ll be lily pads in
the fountain. Maybe you can hear what they are saying,
or maybe the gold-fish will bring you a message,
because you are a little mortal who has such a kind
heart that you have been given the power to understand
the speech of everything which creeps or swims or
flies.&rdquo;

Georgina leaned over and looked into the imaginary
fountain dubiously, forgetting in her interest of
the moment that her companion was the great Milford
Norris Locke. She was entering with him into the spirit
of his game of &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; as if he were
Richard.

&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; she suggested.
&ldquo;Have it a frog instead of a fish that brings
the message. He can jump right out of that lily pad
on to the edge of the fountain where I am sitting,
and then when you look at the picture you can see
us talking together. No one could tell what I was
doing if they saw me just looking down into the fountain,
but they could tell right away if the frog was here
and I was shaking my finger at him as if I were saying:

&ldquo;&rsquo;Now tell me the truth, Mr. Frog, or
the Ogre of the Oozy Marsh shall eat you ere the day
be done.&rsquo;&rdquo;

&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move. Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo;
called Mr. Locke, excitedly. &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s
perfect. That&rsquo;s exactly what I want. Hold that
pose for a moment or two. Why, Georgina, you&rsquo;ve
given me exactly what I wanted and a splendid idea
besides. It will give the fairy tale an entirely new
turn. If you can only hold that position a bit longer,
then you may rest.&rdquo;

His pencil flew with magical rapidity and as he sketched
he kept on talking in order to hold the look of intense
interest which showed in her glowing face.

&ldquo;I dearly love stories like that,&rdquo; sighed
Georgina when he came to the end and told her to lean
back and rest a while.

&ldquo;Barby--I mean my mother--and I act them all
the time, and sometimes we make them up ourselves.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll write them when you grow
up,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Locke not losing a moment,
but sketching her in the position she had taken of
her own accord.

&ldquo;Maybe I shall,&rdquo; exclaimed Georgina, thrilled
by the thought. &ldquo;My grandfather Shirley said
I could write for his paper some day. You know he&rsquo;s
an editor, down in Kentucky. I&rsquo;d like to be the
editor of a magazine that children would adore the
way I do the _St. Nicholas_.&rdquo;

Tippy would have said that Georgina was &ldquo;run-ning
on.&rdquo; But Mr. Locke did not think so. Children
always opened their hearts to him. He held the magic
key. Georgina found it easier to tell him her inmost
feelings than anybody else in the world but Barby.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a beautiful game you and Dicky
were playing this morning,&rdquo; he remarked presently,
&ldquo;tagging each other with rainbows. I believe
I&rsquo;ll put it into this fairy tale, have the water-nixies
do it as they slide over the water-fall.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t half as nice as the game
we play in earnest,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;In
our Rainbow Club we have a sort of game of tag. We
tag a person with a good time, or some kindness to
make them happy, and we pretend that makes a little
rainbow in the world. Do you think it does?&rdquo;

&ldquo;It makes a very real one, I am sure,&rdquo;
was the serious answer. &ldquo;Have you many members?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Just Richard and me and the bank president,
Mr. Gates, so far, but--but you can belong--if you&rsquo;d
like to.&rdquo;

She hesitated a trifle over the last part of her invitation,
having just remembered what a famous man she was talking
to. He might think she was taking a liberty even to
suggest that he might care to belong.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it very much,&rdquo; he assured
her gravely, &ldquo;if you think I can live up to
the requirements.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, you already have,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Think
of all the happy hours you have made for people with
your books and pictures--just swarms and bevies and
_flocks_ of rainbows! We would have put you
on the list of honorary members anyhow. Those are
the members who don&rsquo;t know they are members,&rdquo;
she explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just like the prisms
themselves. Prisms don&rsquo;t know they are prisms
but everybody who looks at them sees the beautiful
places they make in the world.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Georgina,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;that
is the very loveliest thing that was ever said to
me in all my life. Make me club member number four
and I&rsquo;ll play the game to my very best ability.
I&rsquo;ll try to do some tagging really worth while.&rdquo;

He had been sketching constantly all the time he talked,
and now, impelled by curiosity, Georgina got up from
the stone bench and walked over to take a look at
his work. He had laid aside the several outline studies
he had made of her, and was now exercising his imagination
in sketching a ship.

&ldquo;This is to be the one that brings the Princess
home, and in a minute I want you to pose for the Princess,
for she is to have curls, long, golden ones, and she
is to hold her head as you did a few moments ago when
you were talking about looking off to sea.&rdquo;

Georgina brought her hands together in a quick gesture
as she said imploringly, &ldquo;Oh, _do_
put Hope at the prow. Every time I pass the Figurehead
House and see Hope sitting up on the portico roof I
wish I could see how she looked when she was riding
the waves on the prow of a gallant vessel. That&rsquo;s
where she ought to be, I heard a man say. He said
Hope squatting on a portico roof may look ridiculous,
but Hope breasting the billows is superb.&rdquo;

Mr. Locke was no stranger in the town. He knew the
story of the figurehead as the townspeople knew it,
now he heard its message as Uncle Darcy knew it. He
listened as intently to Georgina as she had listened
to him. At the end he lifted his head, peering fixedly
through half-closed eyes at nothing.

&ldquo;You have made me see the most beautiful ship,&rdquo;
he said, musingly. &ldquo;It is a silver shallop coming
across a sea of Dreams, its silken sails set wide,
and at the prow is an angel. &rsquo;White-handed Hope,
thou hovering angel girt with golden wings,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he quoted. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll make it with golden
wings sweeping back over the sides this way. See?&rdquo;

His pencil flew over the paper again, showing her
in a few swift strokes an outline of the vision she
had given him.  And now Tippy would have said not
only that Georgina was &ldquo;running on,&rdquo; but
that she was &ldquo;wound up,&rdquo; for with such
a sympathetic and appreciative listener, she told him
the many things she would have taken to Barby had she
been at home. Especially, she talked about her difficulties
in living up to the aim of the club. In stories there
are always poor people whom one can benefit; patient
sufferers at hospitals, pallid children of the slums.
But in the range of Georgina&rsquo;s life there seemed
to be so few opportunities and those few did not always
turn out the way they should.

For instance, there was the time she tried to cheer
Tippy up with her &ldquo;line to live by,&rdquo; and
her efforts were neither appreciated nor understood.
And there was the time only yesterday when she stayed
with Aunt Elspeth, and got into trouble with the eggs,
and now had a debt on her conscience equal to eight
eggs or twenty cents.

It showed how well Mr. Locke understood children when
he did not laugh over the recital of that last calamity,
although it sounded unspeakably funny to him as Georgina
told it. In such congenial company the time flew so
fast that Georgina was amazed when Mr. Milford drove
up to take his distinguished guest away. Mr. Locke
took with him what he had hoped to get, a number of
sketches to fill in at his leisure.

&ldquo;They&rsquo;re exactly what I wanted,&rdquo;
he assured her gratefully as he shook hands at parting.
&ldquo;And that suggestion of yours for the ship will
make the most fetching illustration of all. I&rsquo;ll
send you a copy in oils when I get time for it, and
I&rsquo;ll always think of you, my little friend, as
_Georgina of the Rainbows_.&rdquo;

With a courtly bow he was gone, and Georgina went
into the house to look for the little blank book in
which she had started to keep her two lists of Club
members, honorary and real. The name of Milford Norris
Locke she wrote in both lists. If there had been a
third list, she would have written him down in that
as the very nicest gentleman she had ever met. Then
she began a letter to Barby, telling all about her
wonderful morning. But it seemed to her she had barely
begun, when Mr. Milford&rsquo;s chauffeur came driving
back with something for her in a paper bag. When she
peeped inside she was so astonished she nearly dropped
it.

&ldquo;Eggs!&rdquo; she exclaimed. Then in unconscious
imitation of Mrs. Saggs, she added, &ldquo;Can you
beat _that_!&rdquo;

One by one she took them out and counted them. There
were exactly eight. Then she read the card which had
dropped down to the bottom of the bag.

&ldquo;Mr. Milford Norris Locke.&rdquo;

Above the name was a tiny rainbow done in water colors,
and below was scribbled the words, &ldquo;Last tag.&rdquo;

It was a pity that the new member could not have seen
her face at that instant, its expression was so eloquent
of surprise, of pleasure and of relief that her trouble
had thus been wiped out of existence.

Chapter XXIII
Light Dawns for Uncle Darcy

For some time the faint jangle of a bell had been
sounding at intervals far down the street. Ordinarily
it would have caught Georgina&rsquo;s attention long
before this, but absorbed in the letter to which she
had returned after putting the eggs down cellar, she
did not hear the ringing until it was near enough
for the Towncrier&rsquo;s message to be audible also.
He was announcing the extra day of the Bazaar, and
calling attention to the many new attractions it would
have to offer on the morrow.

Instantly, Georgina dropped her pencil and flew out
to meet him. Here was an opportunity to find out all
about the Brewster trip. As he came towards her she
saw the same look in his weather-beaten old face which
she had wondered at the day before, when he was bending
over Aunt Elspeth, patting her on the cheek. It was
like the shining of a newly-lighted candle.

She was not the only one who had noticed it. All the
way up the street glances had followed him. People
turned for a second look, wondering what good fortune
had befallen the old fellow. They had come to expect
a cheery greeting from him. He always left a kindly
glow behind him whenever he passed. But to-day the
cheeriness was so intensified that he seemed to be
brimming over with good will to everybody.

&ldquo;Why, Uncle Darcy!&rdquo; cried Georgina. &ldquo;You
look so happy!&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, is it any wonder, lass, with such news
from Danny? Him alive and well and sure to come back
to me some of these days! I could hardly keep from
shouting it out to everybody as I came along the street.
I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;ll just naturally tell itself
some day, in spite of my promise to Belle. I&rsquo;m
glad I can let off steam up here, you knowing the secret,
too, for this old heart of mine is just about to burst
with all the gladness that&rsquo;s inside of me.&rdquo;

Here was someone as anxious to tell as she was to
hear; someone who could recall every word of the interview
with the wild-cat woman. Georgina swung on to his
arm which held the bell, and began to ask questions,
and nothing loath, he let her lead him into the yard
and to the rustic seat running around the trunk of
the big willow tree. He was ready to rest, now that
his route was traveled and his dollar earned.

Belle, back in the kitchen, preparing a light dinner
for herself and Georgina, Tippy being away for the
day, did not see him come in. She had not seen him
since the day the old rifle gave up its secret, and
she tried to put him out of her mind as much as possible,
for she was miserable every time she thought of him.
She would have been still more miserable could she
have heard all that he was saying to Georgina.

&ldquo;Jimmy Milford thought that the liniment folks
calling the boy &lsquo;Dave,&rsquo; proved that he
wasn&rsquo;t the same as my Danny. But just one thing
would have settled all doubts for me if I&rsquo;d
a had any. That was what he kept a calling in his
fever when he was out of his head: &rsquo;Belle mustn&rsquo;t
suffer. Belle must be spared, no matter what happens!&rsquo;

&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the one thing that reconciles
me to keeping still a while longer. It was his wish
to spare her, and if he could sacrifice so much to
do it, I can&rsquo;t make his sacrifice seem in vain.
I lay awake last night till nearly daylight, thinking
how I&rsquo;d like to take this old bell of mine,
and go from one end of the town to the other, ringing
it till it cracked, crying out, _&rsquo;Danny
is innocent,_&rsquo; to the whole world. But
the time hasn&rsquo;t come yet. I&rsquo;ll have to
be patient a while longer and bear up the best I can.&rdquo;

Georgina, gazing fixedly ahead of her at nothing in
particular, pondered seriously for a long, silent
moment.

&ldquo;If you did that,&rdquo; she said finally, &ldquo;cried
the good news through the town till everybody knew--then
when people found out that it was Emmett Potter who
was the thief and that he was too much of a coward
to own up and take the blame--would they let the monument
go on standing there, that they&rsquo;d put up to
show he was brave? It would serve him right if they
took it down, wouldn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; she exclaimed
with a savage little scowl drawing her brows together.

&ldquo;No, no, child!&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Give
the lad his due. He _was_ brave that one
time. He saved all those lives as it is chiseled on
his headstone. It is better he should be remembered
for the best act in his life than for the worst one.
A man&rsquo;s measure should be taken when he&rsquo;s
stretched up to his full height, just as far as he
can lift up his head; not when he&rsquo;s stooped
to the lowest. It&rsquo;s only fair to judge either
the living or the dead that way.&rdquo;

For some time after that nothing more was said. The
harbor was full of boats this morning. It was a sight
worth watching. One naturally drifted into day-dreams,
following the sweep of the sails moving silently toward
the far horizon. Georgina was busy picturing a home-coming
scene that made the prodigal son&rsquo;s welcome seem
mild in comparison, when Uncle Darcy startled her
by exclaiming:

&ldquo;Oh, it _pays_ to bear up and steer
right onward! S&rsquo;pose I hadn&rsquo;t done that.
S&rsquo;pose I _hadn&rsquo;t_ kept Hope at
the prow. I believe I&rsquo;d have been in my grave
by this time with all the grief and worry. But now----&rdquo;

He stopped and shook his head, unable to find words
to express the emotion which was making his voice
tremble and his face glow with that wonderful inner
shining. Georgina finished the sentence for him, looking
out on the sail-filled harbor and thinking of the day
he had taken her out in his boat to tell her of his
son.

&ldquo;But now you&rsquo;ll be all ready and waiting
when your ship comes home from sea with its precious
cargo.&rdquo; They were his own words she was repeating.

&ldquo;Danny&rsquo;ll weather the storms at last and
come into port with all flags flying.&rdquo;

The picture her words suggested was too much for the
old father. He put his hat up in front of his face,
and his shoulders shook with silent sobs. Georgina
laid a sympathetic little hand on the rough sleeve
next her. Suddenly the sails in the harbor seemed
to run together all blurry and queer. She drew her
hand across her eyes and looked again at the heaving
shoulders. A happiness so deep that it found its expression
that way, filled her with awe. It must be the kind
of happiness that people felt when they reached &ldquo;the
shining shore, the other side, of Jordan,&rdquo; and
their loved ones came down to welcome them &ldquo;into
their desired haven.&rdquo;

That last phrase came to her lips like a bit of remembered
music and unconsciously she repeated it aloud. Uncle
Darcy heard it, and looked up. His cheeks were wet
when he put down his hat, but it was the happiest
face she had ever seen, and there was no shake in his
voice now when he said solemnly:

&ldquo;And nobody but the good Lord who&rsquo;s helped
his poor sailors through shipwreck and storm, knows
how mightily they&rsquo;ve desired that haven, or
what it means to them to be brought into it.&rdquo;

A delivery wagon from one of the fruit stores stopped
in front of the gate, and the driver came in, carrying
a basket. Uncle Darcy spoke to him as he passed the
willow tree.

&ldquo;Well, Joe, this looks like a chance for me
to get a lift most of the way home.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; was the cordial reply. &ldquo;Climb
in. I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;

Georgina thought of something as he rose to go.

&ldquo;Oh, wait just a minute, Uncle Darcy, I want
to get something of yours that&rsquo;s down cellar.&rdquo;

When she came back there was no time or opportunity
for an explanation. He and the driver were both in
the wagon. She reached up and put the bag on the seat
beside him.

&ldquo;I--I did something to some of your eggs, yesterday,&rdquo;
she stammered, &ldquo;and these are to take the place
of the ones I broke.&rdquo;

Uncle Darcy peered into the bag with a puzzled expression.
He had not missed any eggs from the crock of bran.
He didn&rsquo;t know what she was talking about. But
before he could ask any questions the driver slapped
the horse with the reins, and they were rattling off
down street. Georgina stood looking after them a moment,
then turned her head to listen. Somebody was calling
her. It was Belle, who had come to the front door
to say that dinner was ready.

Whenever Mrs. Triplett was at home, Belle made extra
efforts to talk and appear interested in what was
going on around her. She was afraid her keen-eyed
Aunt Maria would see that she was unhappy. But alone
with Georgina who shared her secret, she relapsed
into a silence so deep it could be felt, responding
only with a wan smile when the child&rsquo;s lively
chatter seemed to force an answer of some kind. But
to-day when Georgina came to the table she was strangely
silent herself, so mute that Belle noticed it, and
found that she was being furtively watched by the big
brown eyes opposite her. Every time Belle looked up
she caught Georgina&rsquo;s gaze fastened on her,
and each time it was immediately transferred to her
plate.

&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Georgina?&rdquo; she
asked finally. &ldquo;Why do you keep staring at me?&rdquo;

Georgina flushed guiltily. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;
was the embarrassed answer. &ldquo;I was just wondering
whether to tell you or not. I thought maybe you&rsquo;d
like to know, and maybe you ought to know, but I wasn&rsquo;t
sure whether you&rsquo;d want me to talk to you about
it or not.&rdquo;

Belle put down her tea-cup. It was her turn to stare.

&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake! What _are_
you beating around the bush about?&rdquo;

&ldquo;About the news from Danny,&rdquo; answered
Georgina. &ldquo;About the letter he wrote to the
wild-cat woman and that got buried in the dunes too
deep ever to be dug up again.&rdquo;

As this was the first Belle had heard of either the
letter or the woman, her expression of astonishment
was all that Georgina could desire. Her news had made
a sensation. Belle showed plainly that she was startled,
and as eager to hear as Georgina was to tell. So she
began at the beginning, from the time of the opening
of the pouch on the Green Stairs, to the last word
of the wild-cat woman&rsquo;s conversation which Uncle
Darcy had repeated to her only a few moments before
under the willow.

Instinctively, she gave the recital a dramatic touch
which made Belle feel almost like an eye witness as
she listened. And it was with Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s
own gestures and manner that she repeated his final
statement.

&ldquo;Jimmy Milford thought the liniment folks calling
the boy Dave proved he wasn&rsquo;t the same as my
Danny. But just one thing would have settled all doubts
for me if I&rsquo;d had any. That was what he kept
a calling in his fever when he was out of his head:
&rsquo;_Belle_ mustn&rsquo;t suffer. _Belle_
must be spared no matter what happens.&rsquo;&rdquo;

At the bringing of her own name into the story Belle
gave a perceptible start and a tinge of red crept
into her pale cheeks.

&ldquo;Did he say that, Georgina?&rdquo; she demanded,
leaning forward and looking at her intently. &ldquo;Are
you sure those are his exact words?&rdquo;

&ldquo;His very-own-exactly-the-same words,&rdquo;
declared Georgina solemnly. &ldquo;I cross my heart
and body they&rsquo;re just as Uncle Darcy told them
to me.&rdquo;

Rising from the table, Belle walked over to the window
and stood with her back to Georgina, looking out into
the garden.

&ldquo;Well, and what next?&rdquo; she demanded in
a queer, breathless sort of way.

&ldquo;And then Uncle Darcy said that his saying that
was the one thing that made him feel willing to keep
still a while longer about--you know--what was in
the rifle. &rsquo;Cause if Danny cared enough about
sparing you to give up home and his good name and
everything else in life he couldn&rsquo;t spoil it
all by telling now. But Uncle Darcy said he lay awake
nearly all last night thinking how he&rsquo;d love
to take that old bell of his and go ringing it through
the town till it cracked, calling out to the world,
&rsquo;My boy is innocent.&rsquo;

&ldquo;And when I said something about it&rsquo;s
all coming out all right some day, and that Danny
would weather the storms and come into port with all
flags flying----&rdquo; Here Georgina lowered her
voice and went on slowly as if she hesitated to speak
of what happened next--&ldquo;he just put his old hat
over his face and cried. And I felt so sorry----&rdquo;

Georgina&rsquo;s voice choked. There were tears in
her eyes as she spoke of the scene.

&ldquo;_Don&rsquo;t_!&rdquo; groaned Belle,
her back still turned.

The note of distress in Belle&rsquo;s voice stilled
Georgina&rsquo;s lively tongue a few seconds, but
there was one more thing in her mind to be said, and
with the persistence of a mosquito she returned to
the subject to give that final stab, quite unconscious
of how deeply it would sting. She was only wondering
aloud, something which she had often wondered to herself.

&ldquo;I should think that when anybody had suffered
as long as Danny has to spare you, it would make you
want to spare him. Doesn&rsquo;t it? I should think
that you&rsquo;d want to do something to sort of make
up to him for it all. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, _don&rsquo;t_!&rdquo; exclaimed
Belle again, sharply this time. Then to Georgina&rsquo;s
utter amazement she buried her face in her apron, stood
sobbing by the window a moment, and ran out of the
room. She did not come downstairs again until nearly
supper time.

Georgina sat at the table, not knowing what to do
next. She felt that she had muddled things dreadfully.
Instead of making Belle feel better as she hoped to
do, she realized she had hurt her in some unintentional
way. Presently, she slowly drew herself up from her
chair and began to clear the table, piling the few
dishes they had used, under the dish-pan in the sink.
The house stood open to the summer breeze. It seemed
so desolate and deserted with Belle upstairs, drawn
in alone with her troubles and Tippy away, that she
couldn&rsquo;t bear to stay in the silent rooms. She
wandered out into the yard and climbed up into the
willow to look across the water.

Somewhere out there on those shining waves, Richard
was sailing along, in the party given for Mr. Locke,
and to-morrow he would be going away on the yacht.
If he were at home she wouldn&rsquo;t be up in the
willow wondering what to do next. Well, as long as
she couldn&rsquo;t have a good time herself she&rsquo;d
think of someone else she could make happy. For several
minutes she sent her thoughts wandering over the list
of all the people she knew, but it seemed as if her
friends were capable of making their own good times,
all except poor Belle. Probably _she_ never
would be happy again, no matter what anybody did to
try to brighten her life. It was so discouraging when
one was trying to play the game of &ldquo;Rainbow Tag,&rdquo;
for there to be no one to tag. She wished she knew
some needy person, some unfortunate soul who would
be glad of her efforts to make them happy.

Once she thought of slipping off down street to the
library. Miss Tupman always let her go in where the
shelves were and choose her own book. Miss Tupman
was always so interesting, too, more than any of the
books when she had time to talk. But that grim old
word Duty rose up in front of her, telling her that
she ought not to run away and leave the house all
open with Belle locked in her room upstairs. Somebody
ought to be within hearing if the telephone rang or
anyone came. She went into the house for a book which
she had read many times but which never failed to interest
her, and curled up in a big rocking chair on the front
porch.

Late in the afternoon she smelled burning pine chips
and smoke from the kitchen chimney which told that
a fire was being started in the stove. After a while
she went around the house to the kitchen door and peeped
in, apprehensively. Belle was piling the dinner dishes
into the pan, preparatory to washing them while supper
was cooking. Her eyes were red and she did not look
up when Georgina came in, but there was an air of
silent determination about her as forcible as her Aunt
Maria&rsquo;s. Picking up the tea-kettle, she filled
the dishpan and carried the kettle back to the stove,
setting it down hard before she spoke. Then she said:

&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;ll ever know what I&rsquo;ve been
through with, fighting this thing out with myself.
I can&rsquo;t go all the way yet. I can&rsquo;t say
the word that&rsquo;ll let the blow fall on poor old
Father Potter. But I don&rsquo;t seem to care about
my part of it any more. I see things differently from
what I did that first day--you know. Even Emmett don&rsquo;t
seem the same any more.&rdquo;

For several minutes there was a rattling of dishes,
but no further speech from Belle. Georgina, not knowing
what to say or do, stood poised uncertainly on the
door-sill. Then Belle spoke again.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing it should be told if only
it could be kept from getting back to Father Potter,
for the way Dan&rsquo;s done _does_ make
me want to set him square with the world. I would
like to make up to him in some way for all he&rsquo;s
suffered on my account. I can&rsquo;t get over it that
it was _him_ that had all the bravery and
the nobleness that I was fairly worshiping in Emmett
all these years. Seems like the whole world has turned
upside down.&rdquo;

Georgina waited a long time, but Belle seemed to have
said all that she intended to say, so presently she
walked over and stood beside the sink.

&ldquo;Belle,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;does
what you said mean that you&rsquo;re really willing
I should tell Barby? Right away?&rdquo;

Belle waited an instant before replying, then taking
a deep breath as if about to make a desperate plunge
into a chasm on whose brink she had long been poised,
said:

&ldquo;Yes. Uncle Dan&rsquo;l would rather have her
know than anybody else. He sets such store by her
good opinion. But oh, _do_ make it plain
it mustn&rsquo;t be talked about outside, so&rsquo;s
it&rsquo;ll get back to Father Potter.&rdquo;

The next instant Georgina&rsquo;s arms were around
her in a silent but joyful squeeze, and she ran upstairs
to write to Barby before the sun should go down or
Tippy get back from the Bazaar.



Chapter XXIV
A Contrast in Fathers

Georgina was having a beautiful day. It was the first
time she had ever taken part in a Bazaar, and so important
was the r&ocirc;le assigned her that she was in a booth
all by herself. Moreover, the little mahogany chair
in which she sat was on a high platform inside the
booth, so that all might behold her. Dressed in a
quaint old costume borrowed from the chests in the
Figurehead House, she represented &ldquo;A Little Girl
of Long Ago.&rdquo;

On a table beside her stood other borrowed treasures
from the Figurehead House--a doll bedstead made by
an old sea captain on one of his voyages. Each of
its high posts was tipped with a white point, carved
from the bone of a whale. Wonderful little patchwork
quilts, a feather bed and tiny pillows made especially
for the bed, were objects of interest to everyone
who crowded around the booth. So were the toys and
dishes brought home from other long cruises by the
same old sea captain, who evidently was an indulgent
father and thought often of the little daughter left
behind in the home port. A row of dolls dressed in
fashions half a century old were also on exhibition.

With unfailing politeness Georgina explained to the
curious summer people who thronged around her, that
they all belonged in the house where the figurehead
of Hope sat on the portico roof, and were not for sale
at any price.

Until to-day Georgina had been unconscious that she
possessed any unusual personal charms, except her
curls. Her attention had been called to them from
the time she was old enough to understand remarks people
made about them as she passed along the street. Their
beauty would have been a great pleasure to her if
Tippy had not impressed upon her the fact that looking
in the mirror makes one vain, and it&rsquo;s wicked
to be vain. One way in which Tippy guarded her against
the sin of vanity was to mention some of her bad points,
such as her mouth being a trifle too large, or her
nose not quite so shapely as her mother&rsquo;s, each
time anyone unwisely called attention to her &ldquo;glorious
hair.&rdquo;

Another way was to repeat a poem from a book called
&ldquo;Songs for the Little Ones at Home,&rdquo; the
same book which had furnished the &ldquo;Landing of
the Pilgrims&rdquo; and &ldquo;Try, Try Again.&rdquo;
It began:

&ldquo;What! Looking in the glass again?
Why&rsquo;s my silly child so vain?"

The disgust, the surprise, the scorn of Tippy&rsquo;s
voice when she repeated that was enough to make one
hurry past a mirror in shame-faced embarrassment.

&ldquo;Beauty soon will fade away.
Your rosy cheeks must soon decay.
There&rsquo;s nothing lasting you will find,
But the treasures of the mind.&rdquo;

Rosy cheeks might not be lasting, but it was certainly
pleasant to Georgina to hear them complimented so
continually by passers-by. Sometimes the remarks were
addressed directly to her.

&ldquo;My _dear_,&rdquo; said one enthusiastic
admirer, &ldquo;if I could only buy _you_
and put you in a gold frame, I&rsquo;d have a prettier
picture than any artist in town can paint.&rdquo;
Then she turned to a companion to add: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
she a love in that little poke bonnet with the row
of rose-buds inside the rim? I never saw such exquisite
coloring or such gorgeous eyes.&rdquo;

Georgina blushed and looked confused as she smoothed
the long lace mitts over her arms. But by the time
the day was over she had heard the sentiment repeated
so many times that she began to expect it and to feel
vaguely disappointed if it were not forthcoming from
each new group which approached her.

Another thing gave her a new sense of pleasure and
enriched her day. On the table beside her, under a
glass case, to protect it from careless handling,
was a little blank book which contained the records
of the first sewing circle in Provincetown. The book
lay open, displaying a page of the minutes, and a
column of names of members, written in an exquisitely
fine and beautiful hand. The name of Georgina&rsquo;s
great-great grandmother was in that column. It gave
her a feeling of being well born and distinguished
to be able to point it out.

The little book seemed to reinforce and emphasize
the claims of the monument and the silver porringer.
She felt it was so nice to be beautiful and to belong;
to have belonged from the beginning both to a first
family and a first sewing circle.

Still another thing added to her contentment whenever
the recollection of it came to her. There was no longer
any secret looming up between her and Barby like a
dreadful wall. The letter telling all about the wonderful
and exciting things which had happened in her absence
was already on its way to Kentucky. It was not a letter
to be proud of. It was scrawled as fast as she could
write it with a pencil, and she knew perfectly well
that a dozen or more words were misspelled, but she
couldn&rsquo;t take time to correct them, or to think
of easy words to put in their places. But Barby wouldn&rsquo;t
care. She would be so happy for Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s
sake and so interested in knowing that her own little
daughter had had an important part in finding the
good news that she wouldn&rsquo;t notice the spelling
or the scraggly writing.

As the day wore on, Georgina, growing more and more
satisfied with herself and her lot, felt that there
was no one in the whole world with whom she would
change places. Towards the last of the afternoon a
group of people came in whom Georgina recognized as
a family from the Gray Inn. They had been at the Inn
several days, and she had noticed them each time she
passed them, because the children seemed on such surprisingly
intimate terms with their father. That he was a naval
officer she knew from the way he dressed, and that
he was on a long furlough she knew from some remark
which she overheard.

He had a grave, stern face, and when he came into
the room he gave a searching glance from left to right
as if to take notice of every object in it. His manner
made Georgina think of &ldquo;Casabianca,&rdquo; another
poem of Tippy&rsquo;s teaching:

&ldquo;He stood
As born to rule the storm.
A creature of heroic blood,
A brave though ....... form.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Childlike&rdquo; was the word she left out
because it did not fit in this case. &ldquo;A brave
and manlike form&rdquo; would be better. She repeated
the verse to herself with this alteration.

When he spoke to his little daughter or she spoke
to him his expression changed so wonderfully that
Georgina watched him with deep interest. The oldest
boy was with them. He was about fourteen and as tall
as his mother. He was walking beside her but every
few steps he turned to say something to the others,
and they seemed to be enjoying some joke together.
Somebody who knew them came up as they reached the
booth of &ldquo;The Little Girl of Long Ago,&rdquo;
and introduced them to Georgina, so she found out
their names. It was Burrell. He was a Captain, and
the children were Peggy and Bailey.

As Georgina looked down at Peggy from the little platform
where she sat in the old mahogany chair, she thought
with a throb of satisfaction that she was glad she
didn&rsquo;t have to change places with that homely
little thing. Evidently, Peggy was just up from a
severe illness. Her hair had been cut so short one
could scarcely tell the color of it. She was so thin
and white that her eyes looked too large for her face
and her neck too slender for her head, and the freckles
which would scarcely have shown had she been her usual
rosy self, stood out like big brown spotches on her
pallid little face. She limped a trifle too, as she
walked.

With a satisfied consciousness of her own rose leaf
complexion, Georgina was almost patronizing as she
bent over the table to say graciously once more after
countless number of times, &ldquo;no, that is not for
sale.&rdquo;

The next instant Peggy was swinging on her father&rsquo;s
arm exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh, Dad-o&rsquo;-my-heart!
See that cunning doll bathing suit. Please get it for
me.&rdquo; Almost in the same breath Bailey, jogging
the Captain&rsquo;s elbow on the other side, exclaimed,
&ldquo;Look, Partner, _that&rsquo;s&lt;i&gt; a relic
worth having.&rdquo;_

Georgina listened, fascinated. To think of calling
one&rsquo;s father &ldquo;Dad-o&rsquo;- my-heart&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Partner!&rdquo; And they looked up at him
as if they adored him, even that big boy, nearly grown.
And a sort of laugh come into the Captain&rsquo;s
eyes each time they spoke to him, as if he thought
everything they said and did was perfect.

A wave of loneliness swept over Georgina as she listened.
There was an empty spot in her heart that ached with
longing--not for Barby, but for the father whom she
had never known in this sweet intimate way. She knew
now how if felt to be an orphan. What satisfaction
was there in having beautiful curls if no big, kind
hand ever passed over them in a fatherly caress such
as was passing over Peggy Burrell&rsquo;s closely-clipped
head? What pleasure was there in having people praise
you if they said behind your back:

&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Justin Huntingdon&rsquo;s
daughter. Don&rsquo;t you think a man would want to
come home once or twice in a lifetime to such a lovely
child as that?&rdquo;

Georgina had heard that very remark earlier in the
day, also the answer given with a significant shrug
of the shoulders:

&ldquo;Oh, he has other fish to fry.&rdquo;

The remarks had not annoyed her especially at the
time, but they rankled now as she recalled them. They
hurt until they took all the pleasure and satisfaction
out of her beautiful day, just as the sun, going under
a cloud, leaves the world bereft of all its shine
and sparkle. She looked around, wishing it were time
to go home.

Presently, Captain Burrell, having made the rounds
of the room, came back to Georgina. He smiled at her
so warmly that she wondered that she could have thought
his face was stern.

&ldquo;They tell me that you are Doctor Huntingdon&rsquo;s
little girl,&rdquo; he said with a smile that went
straight to her heart. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve come back
to ask you all about him. Where is he now and how
is he? You see I have an especial interest in your
distinguished father. He pulled me through a fever
in the Philippines that all but ended me. I have reason
to remember him for his many, many kindnesses to me
at that time.&rdquo;

The flush that rose to Georgina&rsquo;s face might
naturally have been taken for one of pride or pleasure,
but it was only miserable embarrassment at not being
able to answer the Captain&rsquo;s questions. She could
not bear to confess that she knew nothing of her father&rsquo;s
whereabouts except the vague fact that he was somewhere
in the interior of China, and that there had been
no letter from him for months and that she had not
seen him for nearly four years.

&ldquo;He--he was well the last time we heard from
him,&rdquo; she managed to stammer. &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t
heard anything lately. You know my mother isn&rsquo;t
home now. She went to Kentucky because my grandfather
Shirley was hurt in an accident.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that,&rdquo; was
the answer in a cordial, sympathetic voice. &ldquo;I
hoped to have the pleasure of meeting her and I wanted
Mrs. Burrell to know her, too. But I hope you&rsquo;ll
come over to the Inn and play with Peggy sometimes.
We&rsquo;ll be here another week.&rdquo;

Georgina thanked him in her prettiest manner, but
she was relieved when he passed on, and she was freed
from the fear of any more embarrassing questions about
her father. Yet her hand still tingled with the friendliness
of his good-bye clasp, and she wished that she could
know him better. As she watched him pass out of the
door with Peggy holding his hand and swinging it as
they walked, she thought hungrily:

&ldquo;How good it must seem to have a father like
_that_.&rdquo;

Mrs. Triplett came up to her soon after. It was time
to close the Bazaar. The last probable customer had
gone, and the ladies in charge of the booths were
beginning to dismantle them. Someone&rsquo;s chauffeur
was waiting to take Georgina&rsquo;s costume back
to the Figurehead House.

She followed Mrs. Triplett obediently into an improvised
dressing-room in the corner, behind a tall screen,
and in a very few minutes was about to emerge clad
in her own clothes, when Mrs. Triplett exclaimed:

&ldquo;For pity sakes! Those gold beads!&rdquo;

Georgina&rsquo;s hand went up to the string of gold
beads still around her neck. They also were borrowed
from Mrs. Tupman of the Figurehead House.

&ldquo;I was going to ask Mrs. Tupman to take them
home herself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Triplett, &ldquo;but
she left earlier than I thought she would, and I had
no chance to say anything about them. We oughtn&rsquo;t
to trust anything as valuable as gold beads that are
an heirloom to any outsider, no matter how honest.
They might be lost. Suppose you just _wear_
them home to her. Do you feel like doing that? And
keep them on your neck till she unclasps them with
her own hands. Don&rsquo;t leave them with a servant.&rdquo;

Georgina, tired of sitting all day in the booth, was
glad of an excuse for a long walk. It was almost six
o&rsquo;clock, but the sun was still high. As she
went along, jostled off the narrow sidewalk and back
on to it again every few steps by the good-natured
crowd which swarmed the streets at this hour, she
could smell supper cooking in the houses along the
way. It would be delayed in many homes because the
tide was in and people were running down the beach
from the various cottages for a dip into the sea.
Some carried their bathing suits in bundles, some wore
them under raincoats or dressing gowns, and some walked
boldly along bare-armed and bare-legged in the suits
themselves.

It was a gay scene, with touches of color in every
direction. Vivid green grass in all the door-yards,
masses of roses and hollyhocks and clematis against
the clean white of the houses. Color of every shade
in the caps and sweaters and bathing suits and floating
motor veils and parasols, jolly laughter everywhere,
and friendly voices calling back and forth across
the street. It was a holiday town full of happy holiday
people.

Georgina, skipping along through the midst of it,
added another pretty touch of color to the scene,
with her blue ribbons and hat with the forget-me-nots
around it, but if her thoughts could have been seen,
they would have showed a sober drab. The meeting with
Captain Burrell had left her depressed and unhappy.
The thought uppermost in her mind was why should there
be such a difference in fathers? Why should Peggy Burrell
have such an adorable one, and she be left to feel
like an orphan?

When she reached the Figurehead House she was told
that Mrs. Tupman had stepped out to a neighbor&rsquo;s
for a few minutes but would be right back. She could
have left the beads with a member of the family, but
having been told to deliver them into the hands of
the owner only, she sat down in the swing in the yard
to wait.

From where she sat she could look up at the figurehead
over the portico. It was the best opportunity she
had ever had for studying it closely. Always before
she had been limited to the few seconds that were hers
in walking or driving by. Now she could sit and gaze
at it intently as she pleased.

The fact that it was weather-stained and dark as an
Indian with the paint worn off its face in patches,
only enhanced its interest in her eyes. It seemed
to bear the scars of one who has suffered and come
up through great tribulation. No matter how battered
this Lady of Mystery was in appearance, to Georgina
she still stood for &ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; clinging to
her wreath, still facing the future with head held
high, the symbol of all those, who having ships at
sea, watch and wait for their home-coming with proud,
undaunted courage.

Only an old wooden image, but out of a past of shipwreck
and storm its message survived and in some subtle
manner found its way into the heart of Georgina.

&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll do it, too,&rdquo; she resolved
valiantly, looking up at it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to hope so hard that he&rsquo;ll be the way I want
him to be, that he&rsquo;ll just _have_
to. And if he isn&rsquo;t--then I&rsquo;ll just steer
straight onward as if I didn&rsquo;t mind it, so Barby&rsquo;ll
never know how disappointed I am. Barby must never
know that.&rdquo;

A few minutes later, the gold beads being delivered
into Mrs. Tupman&rsquo;s own hands, Georgina took
her way homeward, considerably lighter of heart, for
those moments of reflection in the swing. As she passed
the antique shop a great gray cat on the door-step,
rose and stretched itself.

&ldquo;Nice kitty!&rdquo; she said, stopping to smooth
the thick fur which stood up as he arched his back.

It was &ldquo;Grandpa,&rdquo; to whose taste for fish
she owed her prism and the bit of philosophy which
was to brighten not only her own life but all those
which touched hers. But she passed on, unconscious
of her debt to him.

When she reached the Gray Inn she walked more slowly,
for on the beach back of it she saw several people
whom she recognized. Captain Burrell was in the water
with Peggy and Bailey and half a dozen other children
from the Inn. They were all splashing and laughing.
They seemed to be having some sort of a game. She
stood a moment wishing that she had on her bathing
suit and was down in the water with them. She could
swim better than any of the children there. But she
hadn&rsquo;t been in the sea since Barby left. That
was one of the things she promised in their dark hour
of parting, not to go in while Barby was gone.

While she stood there, Mrs. Burrell came out on the
piazza of the Inn, followed by the colored nurse with
the baby who was just learning to walk. The Captain,
seeing them, threw up his hand to signal them. Mrs.
Burrell fluttered her handkerchief in reply.

Georgina watched the group in the water a moment longer,
then turned and walked slowly on. She felt that if
she could do it without having to give up Barby, she&rsquo;d
be willing to change places with Peggy Burrell. She&rsquo;d
take her homely little pale, freckled face, straight
hair and--yes, even her limp, for the right to cling
to that strong protecting shoulder as Peggy was doing
there in the water, and to whisper in his ear, &ldquo;Dad-o-my-heart.&rdquo;



Chapter XXV
A Letter to Hong-Kong

There are some subjects one hesitates to discuss
with one&rsquo;s family. It is easier to seek information
from strangers or servants, who do not feel free to
come back at you with the disconcerting question, &ldquo;But
why do you ask?&rdquo;

It was with the half-formed resolution of leading
up to a certain one of these difficult subjects if
she could, that Georgina wandered down the beach next
morning to a little pavilion near the Gray Inn. It
was occupied by Peggy Burrell, her baby brother and
the colored nurse Melindy.

Georgina, sorely wanting companionship now that Richard
and Captain Kidd were off on their yachting trip,
was thankful that Mrs. Triplett had met Captain Burrell
the day before at the Bazaar, and had agreed with him
that Georgina and Peggy ought to be friends because
their fathers were. Otherwise, the occupants of the
pavilion would have been counted as undesirable playmates
being outside the pale of her acquaintance.

Peggy welcomed her joyfully. She wasn&rsquo;t strong
enough yet to go off on a whole morning&rsquo;s fishing
trip with brother and Daddy, she told Georgina, and
her mother was playing bridge on the hotel piazza.
Peggy was a little thing, only eight, and Georgina
not knowing what to do to entertain her, resurrected
an old play that she had not thought of for several
summers. She built Grandfather Shirley&rsquo;s house
in the sand.

It took so long to find the right kind of shells with
which to make the lanterns for the gate-posts, and
to gather the twigs of bayberry and beach plum for
the avenues (she had to go into the dunes for them),
that the question she was intending to ask Melindy
slipped from her mind for a while. It came back to
her, however, as she scooped a place in the wall of
pebbles and wet sand which stood for the fence.

&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the place where the postman drops
the mail.&rdquo;

Then she looked up at Melindy, the question on the
tip of her tongue. But Peggy, on her knees, was watching
her so intently that she seemed to be looking straight
into her mouth every time it opened, and her courage
failed her. Instead of saying what she had started
to say, she exclaimed:

&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the hole in the fence where the
little pigs squeezed through.&rdquo; Then she told
the story that went with this part of the game. When
it was time to put in the bee-hives, however, and
Peggy volunteered to look up and down the beach for
the right kind of a pebble to set the bee-hives on,
Georgina took advantage of the moment alone with Melindy.
There wasn&rsquo;t time to lead up to the question
properly. There wasn&rsquo;t even time to frame the
question in such a way that it would seem a casual,
matter-of-course one. Georgina was conscious that
the blood was surging up into her cheeks until they
must seem as red as fire. She leaned forward toward
the sand-pile she was shaping till her curls fell over
her face. Then she blurted out:

&ldquo;How often do husbands write to wives?&rdquo;

Melindy either did not hear or did not understand,
and Georgina had the mortifying experience of repeating
the question. It was harder to give utterance to it
the second time than the first. She was relieved when
Melindy answered without showing any surprise.

&ldquo;Why, most every week I reckon, when they loves
&rsquo;em. Leastways white folks do. It comes easy
to them to write. An&rsquo; I lived in one place where
the lady got a lettah every othah day.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But I mean when the husband&rsquo;s gone for
a long, long time, off to sea or to another country,
and is dreadfully busy, like Captain Burrell is when
he&rsquo;s on his ship.

Melindy gave a short laugh. &ldquo;Huh! Let me tell
you, honey, when a man _wants_ to write
he&rsquo;s gwine to write, busy or no busy.&rdquo;

Later, Georgina went home pondering Melindy&rsquo;s
answer. &ldquo;Most every week when they love&rsquo;s
&rsquo;em. Sometimes every other day.&rdquo; And Barby
had had no letter for over four months.

Something happened that afternoon which had never
happened before in all Georgina&rsquo;s experience.
She was taken to the Gray Inn to call. Mrs. Triplett,
dressed in her new black summer silk, took her.

&ldquo;As long as Barbara isn&rsquo;t here to pay
some attention to that Mrs. Burrell,&rdquo; Tippy
said to Belle, &ldquo;it seems to me it&rsquo;s my
place as next of kin. The Captain couldn&rsquo;t get
done saying nice things about Justin.&rdquo;

Evidently, she approved of both Mrs. Burrell and Peggy,
for when each begged that Georgina be allowed to stay
to supper she graciously gave permission.

&ldquo;Peggy has taken the wildest fancy to you, dear,&rdquo;
Mrs. Burrell said in an aside to Georgina. &ldquo;You
gave her a beautiful morning on the beach. The poor
little thing has suffered so much with her lame knee,
that we are grateful to anyone who makes her forget
all that she has gone through. It&rsquo;s only last
week that she could have the brace taken off. She hasn&rsquo;t
been able to run and play like other children for two
years, but we&rsquo;re hoping she may outgrow the
trouble in time.&rdquo;

The dining-room of the Gray Inn overlooked thel sea,
and was so close to the water one had the feeling
of being in a boat, when looking out of its windows.
There were two South American transports in the harbor.
Some of the officers had come ashore and were dining
with friends at the Gray Inn. Afterwards they stayed
to dance a while in the long parlor with the young
ladies of the party. Peggy and Georgina sat on the
piazza just outside one of the long French windows,
where they could watch the gay scene inside. It seemed
almost as gay outside, when one turned to look across
the harbor filled with moving lights. Captain and Mrs.
Burrell were outside also. They sat farther down the
piazza, near the railing, talking to one of the officers
who was not dancing. Once when the music stopped,
Peggy turned to Georgina to say:

&ldquo;Do you hear Daddy speaking Spanish to that
officer from South America? Doesn&rsquo;t he do it
well? I can understand a little of what they say because
we lived in South America a while last year. We join
him whenever he is stationed at a port where officers
can take their families. He says that children of
the navy have to learn to be regular gypsies. I love
going to new places. How many languages can your father
speak?&rdquo;

Georgina, thus suddenly questioned, felt that she
would rather die than acknowledge that she knew so
little of her father that she could not answer. She
was saved the mortification of confessing it, however,
by the music striking up again at that moment.

&ldquo;Oh, I can play that!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dance of the tarantula. Isn&rsquo;t
it a weird sort of thing?&rdquo;

The air of absorbed interest with which Georgioa turned
to listen to the music made Peggy forget her question,
and listen in the same way. She wanted to do everything
in the same way that Georgina did it, and from that
moment that piece of music held special charm for her
because Georgina called it weird.

The next time Georgina glanced down the piazza Mrs.
Burrell was alone. In her dimly-lighted corner, she
looked like one of the pretty summer girls one sees
sometimes on a magazine cover. She was all in white
with a pale blue wrap of some kind about her that
was so soft and fleecy it looked like a pale blue
cloud. Georgina found herself looking down that way
often, with admiring glances. She happened to have
her eyes turned that way when the Captain came back
and stood beside her chair. The blue wrap had slipped
from her shoulders without her notice, and he stooped
and picked it up. Then he drew the soft, warm thing
up around her, and bending over, laid his cheek for
just an instant against hers.

It was such a fleeting little caress that no one saw
but Georgina, and she turned her eyes away instantly,
feeling that she had no right to look, yet glad that
she had seen, because of the warm glow it sent through
her. She couldn&rsquo;t tell why, but somehow the world
seemed a happier sort of place for everybody because
such things happened in it.

&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she thought wistfully, as
her eyes followed the graceful steps of the foreign
dancers and her thoughts stayed with what she had
just witnessed, &ldquo;I wonder if that had been Barby
and my father, would _he_?&rdquo;----

But she did not finish even to herself the question
which rose up to worry her. It came back every time
she recalled the little scene.

On the morning after her visit to the Gray Inn she
climbed up on the piano stool when she had finished
practising her scales. She wanted a closer view of
the portrait which hung over it. It was an oil painting
of her father at the age of five. He wore kilts and
little socks with plaid tops, and he carried a white
rabbit in his arms. Georgina knew every inch of the
canvas, having admired it from the time she was first
held up to it in someone&rsquo;s arms to &ldquo;see
the pretty bunny.&rdquo; Now she looked at it long
and searchingly.

Then she opened the book-case and took out an old
photograph album. There were several pictures of her
father in that. One taken with his High School class,
and one with a group of young medical students, and
one in the white service dress of an assistant surgeon
of the navy. None of them corresponded with her dim
memory of him.

Then she went upstairs to Barby&rsquo;s room, and
stood before the bureau, studying the picture upon
it in a large silver frame. It was taken in a standing
position and had been carefully colored, so that she
knew accurately every detail of the dress uniform
of a naval surgeon from the stripes of gold lace and
maroon velvet on the sleeves, to the eagle on the
belt buckle and the sword knot dangling over the scabbard.
There were various medals pinned on his breast which
had always interested her.

But this morning it was not the uniform or the decorations
which claimed her attention. It was the face itself.
She was looking for something in the depths of those
serious dark eyes, that she had seen in Captain Burrell&rsquo;s
when he looked at Peggy; something more than a smile,
something that made his whole face light up till you
felt warm and happy just to look at him. She wondered
if the closely-set lips she was studying could curve
into a welcoming smile if anybody ran to meet him with
happy outstretched arms. But the picture was baffling
and disappointing, because it was a profile view.

Presently, she picked it up and carried it to her
own room, placing it on the table where she always
sat to write. She had screwed up her courage at last,
to the point of writing the letter which long ago she
had decided ought to be written by somebody.

Once Barby said, &ldquo;When you can&rsquo;t think
of anything to put in a letter, look at the person&rsquo;s
picture, and pretend you&rsquo;re talking to it.&rdquo;
Georgina followed that advice now. But one cannot
talk enthusiastically to a listener who continues
to show you only his profile.

Suddenly, her resentment flamed hot against this handsome,
averted face which was all she knew of a father. She
thought bitterly that he had no business to be such
a stranger to her that she didn&rsquo;t even know what
he looked like when he smiled. Something of the sternness
of her old Pilgrim forbears crept into her soul as
she sat there judging him and biting the end of her
pen. She glanced down at the sheet of paper on which
she had painstakingly written &ldquo;Dear Father.&rdquo;
Then she scratched out the words, feeling she could
not honestly call him that when he was such a stranger.
Taking a clean sheet of paper, she wrote even more
painstakingly:

&ldquo;Dear Sir: There are two reesons----&rdquo;

Then she looked up in doubt about the spelling of
that last word. She might have gone downstairs and
consulted the dictionary but her experience had proved
that a dictionary is an unsatisfactory book when one
does not know how to spell a word. It is by mere chance
that what one is looking for can be found. After thinking
a moment she put her head out of the window and called
softly down to Belle, who was sewing on the side porch.
She called softly so that Tippy could not hear and
answer and maybe add the remark, &ldquo;But why do
you ask? Are you writing to your mother?&rdquo;

Belle spelled the word for her, and taking another
sheet of paper Georgina made a fresh start. This time
she did not hesitate over the spelling, but scribbled
recklessly on until all that was crowding up to be
said was on the paper.

&ldquo;Dear Sir: There are two reasons for writing
this. One is about your wife. Cousin Mehitable says
something is eating her heart out, and I thought you
ought to know. Maybe as you can cure so many strange
diseeses you can do something for her. The other is
to ask you to send us another picture of yourself.
The only ones we have of you are looking off sideways,
and I can&rsquo;t feel as well acquainted with you
as if I could look into your eyes.

&ldquo;There is a lovely father staying at the Gray
Inn. He is Peggy Burrell&rsquo;s. He is a naval officer,
too. It makes me feel like an orfan when I see him
going down the street holding her hand. He asked me
to tell him all about where you are and what you are
doing, because you cured him once on a hospital ship,
and I was ashamed to tell him that I didn&rsquo;t know
because Barby has not had a letter from you for over
four months. Please don&rsquo;t let on to her that
I wrote this. She doesn&rsquo;t know that I was under
the bed when Cousin Mehitable was talking about you,
and saying that everybody thinks it is queer you never
come home. If you can do only one of the things I
asked, please do the first one. Yours truly, Georgina
Huntingdon.&rdquo;

Having blotted the letter, Georgina read it over carefully,
finding two words that did not look quite right, although
she did not know what was the matter with them. So
she called softly out of the window again to Belle:

&ldquo;How do you spell diseases?&rdquo;

Belle told her but added the question, &ldquo;Why
do you ask a word like that? Whose diseases can you
be writing about?&rdquo;

Georgina drew in her head without answering. She could
not seek help in that quarter again, especially for
such a word as &ldquo;orfan.&rdquo; After studying
over it a moment she remembered there was a poem in
&ldquo;Songs for the Little Ones at Home,&rdquo; called
&ldquo;The Orphan Nosegay Girl.&rdquo;

A trip downstairs for the tattered volume gave her
the word she wanted, and soon the misspelled one was
scratched out and rewritten. There were now three
unsightly blots on the letter and she hovered over
them a moment, her pride demanding that she should
make a clean, fair copy. But it seemed such an endless
task to rewrite it from beginning to end, that she
finally decided to send it as it stood.

Addressed, stamped and sealed, it was ready at last
and she dropped it into the mail-box. Then she had
a moment of panic. It was actually started on its
way to Hong-Kong and nothing in her power could stop
it or bring it back. She wondered if she hadn&rsquo;t
done exactly the wrong thing, and made a bad matter
worse.

Chapter XXVI
Peggy Joins the Rainbow-Makers

Only one more thing happened before Barby&rsquo;s
return that is worth recording. Georgina went to spend
the way at the Gray Inn. Captain Burrell, himself,
came to ask her. Peggy had to be put back into her
brace again he said. He was afraid it had been taken
off too soon. She was very uncomfortable and unhappy
on account of it. They would be leaving in the morning,
much earlier than they had intended, because it was
necessary for her physician to see her at once, and
quite probable that she would have to go back to the
sanitarium for a while. She didn&rsquo;t want to leave
Provincetown, because she did not want to go away from
Georgina.

&ldquo;You have no idea how she admires you,&rdquo;
the Captain added, &ldquo;or how she tries to copy
you. Her dream of perfect happiness is to look and
act just like you. Yesterday she made her mother tie
a big pink bow on her poor little cropped head because
you passed by wearing one on your curls. You can cheer
her up more than anyone else in the world.&rdquo;

So Georgina, touched both by the Captain&rsquo;s evident
distress over Peggy&rsquo;s returning lameness, and
Peggy&rsquo;s fondness for her, went gladly. The knowledge
that everything she said and did was admired, made
it easy for her to entertain the child, and the pity
that welled up in her heart every time she watched
the thin little body move around in the tiresome brace,
made her long to do something that would really ease
the burden of such a misfortune.

Mrs. Burrell was busy packing all morning, and in
the afternoon went down the street to do some shopping
that their hurried departure made necessary. Peggy
brought out her post-card album, in which to fasten
all the postals she had added to her collection while
on the Cape. Among them was one of the Figurehead
House, showing &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; perched over the
portico.

&ldquo;Bailey says that&rsquo;s a sea-cook,&rdquo;
Peggy explained gravely. &ldquo;A sea-cook who was
such a wooden-head that when he made doughnuts they
turned green. He&rsquo;s got one in his hand that
he&rsquo;s about to heave into the sea.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, horrors! No!&rdquo; exclaimed Georgina,
as scandalized as if some false report had been circulated
about one of her family.

&ldquo;That is Hope with a wreath in her hand, looking
up with her head held high, just as she did when she
was on the prow of a gallant ship. Whenever I have
any trouble or disappointment I think of her, and she
helps me to bear up and be brave, and go on as if nothing
had happened.&rdquo;

&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Peggy, gazing with wondering
eyes at the picture of the figurehead, which was too
small on the postal to be very distinct. Anything
that Georgina respected and admired so deeply, Peggy
wanted to respect and admire in the same way, but
it was puzzling to understand just what it was that
Georgina saw in that wooden figure to make her feel
so. Accustomed to thinking of it in Bailey&rsquo;s
way, as a sea-cook with a doughnut, it was hard to
switch around to a point of view that showed it as
Hope with a wreath, or to understand how it could help
one to be brave about anything.

Something of her bewilderment crept into the wondering
&ldquo;why,&rdquo; and Georgina hesitated, a bit puzzled
herself. It was hard to explain to a child two years
younger what had been taught to her by the old Towncrier.

&ldquo;You wait till I run home and get my prism,&rdquo;
she answered. &ldquo;Then I can show you right away,
and we can play a new kind of tag game with it.&rdquo;

Before Peggy could protest that she would rather have
her question unanswered than be left alone, Georgina
was off and running up the beach as fast as her little
white shoes could carry her. Her cheeks were as red
as the coral necklace she wore, when she came back
breathless from her flying trip.

There followed a few moments of rapture for Peggy,
when the beautiful crystal pendant was placed in her
own hands, and she looked through it into a world
transformed by the magic of its coloring. She saw the
room changed in a twinkling, as when a fairy wand
transforms a mantle of homespun to cloth-of-gold.
Through the open window she saw an enchanted harbor
filled with a fleet of rainbows. Every sail was outlined
with one, every mast edged with lines of red and gold
and blue. And while she looked, and at the same time
listened, Georgina&rsquo;s explanation caught some
of the same glamor, and sank deep into her tender little
heart.

That was the way that _she_ could change
the world for people she loved--put a rainbow around
their troubles by being so cheery and hopeful that
everything would be brighter just because she was there.
To keep Hope at the prow simply meant that she mustn&rsquo;t
get discouraged about her knee. No matter how much
it hurt her or the brace bothered her, she must bear
up and steer right on. To do that bravely, without
any fretting, was the surest way in the world to put
a rainbow around her father&rsquo;s troubles.

Thus Georgina mixed her &ldquo;line to live by&rdquo;
and her prism philosophy, but it was clear enough
to the child who listened with heart as well as ears.
And clear enough to the man who sat just outside the
open window on the upper porch, with his pipe, listening
also as he gazed off to sea.

&ldquo;The poor little lamb,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;To think of that baby trying to bear up and
be brave on my account! It breaks me all up.&rdquo;

A few minutes later as he started across the hall,
Peggy, seeing him pass her door, called to him. &ldquo;Oh,
Daddy! Come look through this wonderful fairy glass.
You&rsquo;ll think the whole world is bewitched.&rdquo;

She was lying back in a long steamer chair, and impatient
to reach him, she started to climb out as he entered
the room. But she had not grown accustomed to the
brace again, and she stumbled clumsily on account of
it. He caught her just in time to save her from falling,
but the prism, the shining crystal pendant, dropped
from her hands and struck the rocker of a chair in
its fall to the floor.

She gave a frightened cry, and stood holding her breath
while Georgina stooped and picked it up. It was in
two pieces now. The long, radiant point, cut in many
facets like a diamond, was broken off.

Georgina, pale and trembling at this sudden destruction
of her greatest treasure, turned her back, and for
one horrible moment it was all she could do to keep
from bursting out crying. Peggy, seeing her turn away
and realizing all that her awkwardness was costing
Georgina, buried her face on her father&rsquo;s shoulder
and went into such a wild paroxysm of sobbing and
crying that all his comforting failed to comfort her.

&ldquo;Oh, I wish I&rsquo;d _died_ first,&rdquo;
she wailed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never love me again.
She said it was her most precious treasure, and now
I&rsquo;ve broken it----&rdquo;

&ldquo;There, there, there,&rdquo; soothed the Captain,
patting the thin little arm reached up to cling around
his neck. &ldquo;Georgina knows it was an accident.
She&rsquo;s going to forgive my poor little Peggykins
for what she couldn&rsquo;t help. She doesn&rsquo;t
mind its being broken as much as you think.&rdquo;

He looked across at Georgina, appealingly, helplessly.
Peggy&rsquo;s grief was so uncontrollable he was growing
alarmed. Georgina wanted to cry out:

&ldquo;Oh, I _do_ mind! How can you say
that? I can&rsquo;t stand it to have my beautiful,
beautiful prism ruined!&rdquo;

She was only a little girl herself, with no comforting
shoulder to run to. But something came to her help
just then. She remembered the old silver porringer
with its tall, slim-looped letters. She remembered
there were some things she could not do. She _had_
to be brave now, because her name had been written
around that shining rim through so many brave generations.
She could not deepen the hurt of this poor little
thing already nearly frantic over what she had done.
Tippy&rsquo;s early lessons carried her gallantly
through now. She ran across the room to where Peggy
sat on her father&rsquo;s knee, and put an arm around
her.

&ldquo;Listen, Peggy,&rdquo; she said brightly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a piece of prism for each of us now. Isn&rsquo;t that
nice? You take one and I&rsquo;ll keep the other, and
that will make you a member of our club. We call it
the Rainbow Club, and we&rsquo;re running a race seeing
who can make the most bright spots in the world, by
making people happy. There&rsquo;s just four members
in it so far; Richard and me and the president of
the bank and Mr. Locke, the artist, who made the pictures
in your blue and gold fairy-tale book. And you can
be the fifth. But you&rsquo;ll have to begin this minute
by stopping your crying, or you can&rsquo;t belong.
What did I tell you about fretting?&rdquo;

And Peggy stopped. Not instantly, she couldn&rsquo;t
do that after such a hard spell. The big sobs kept
jerking her for a few minutes no matter how hard she
tried to stiffle them; but she sat up and let her father
wipe her face on his big handkerchief, and she smiled
her bravest, to show that she was worthy of membership
in the new club.

The Captain suddenly drew Georgina to his other knee
and kissed her.

&ldquo;You blessed little rainbow maker!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to join your club
myself. What a happy world this would be if everybody
belonged to it.&rdquo;

Peggy clasped her hands together beseechingly.

&ldquo;Oh, _please_ let him belong, Georgina.
I&rsquo;ll lend him my piece of prism half the time.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Of course he can,&rdquo; consented Georgina.
&ldquo;But he can belong without having a prism. Grown
people don&rsquo;t need anything to help them remember
about making good times in the world.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the Captain, as if he
were talking to himself. Georgina, looking at him
shyly from the corner of her eye, wondered what it
was he wondered.

It was almost supper time when she went home. She
had kept the upper half of the prism which had the
hole in it, and it dangled from her neck on the pink
ribbon as she walked.

&ldquo;If only Barby could have seen it first,&rdquo;
she mourned. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind it so much.
But she&rsquo;ll never know how beautiful it was.&rdquo;

But every time that thought came to her it was followed
by a recollection which made her tingle with happiness.
It was the Captain&rsquo;s deep voice saying tenderly,
&ldquo;You blessed little rainbow-maker!&rdquo;



Chapter XXVII
A Modern &ldquo;St. George and the Dragon&rdquo;

Barby was at home again. Georgina, hearing the jangle
of a bell, ran down the street to meet the old Towncrier
with the news. She knew now, he felt when he wanted
to go through the town ringing his bell and calling
out the good tidings about his Danny to all the world.
That&rsquo;s the way she felt her mother&rsquo;s home-coming
ought to be proclaimed. It was such a joyful thing
to have her back again.

And Grandfather Shirley wasn&rsquo;t going to be blind,
Georgina confided in her next breath. The sight of
both eyes would be all right in time. They were _so_
thankful about that. And Barby had brought her the
darlingest little pink silk parasol ever made or dreamed
of, all the way from Louisville, and some beaten biscuit
and a comb of honey from the beehives in her old home
garden.

It was wonderful how much news Georgina managed to
crowd into the short time that it took to walk back
to the gate. The Burrells had left town and Belle
had gone home, and Richard had sent her a postal card
from Bar Harbor with a snapshot of himself and Captain
Kidd on it. And--she lowered her voice almost to a
whisper as she told the next item:

&ldquo;Barby knows about Danny! Belle said I might
tell her if she&rsquo;d promise not to let it get
back to Mr. Potter.&rdquo;

They had reached the house by this time, and Georgina
led him in to Barby who rose to welcome him with both
hands outstretched.

&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Darcy,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I
know--and I&rsquo;m _so_ glad. And Justin
will be, too. I sent Georgina&rsquo;s letter to him
the very day it came. I knew he&rsquo;d be so interested,
and it can do no harm for him to know, away off there
in the interior of China.&rdquo;

Georgina was startled, remembering the letter which
_she_ had sent to the interior of China.
Surely her father wouldn&rsquo;t send that back to
Barby! Such a panic seized her at the bare possibility
of such a thing, that she did not hear Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s
reply. She wondered what Barby would say if it should
come back to her. Then she recalled what had happened
the first few moments of Barby&rsquo;s return and wondered
what made her think of it.

Barby&rsquo;s first act on coming into the house,
was to walk over to the old secretary where the mail
was always laid, and look to see if any letters were
waiting there for her. And that was before she had
even stopped to take off her veil or gloves. There
were three which had arrived that morning, but she
only glanced at them and tossed them aside. The one
she wanted wasn&rsquo;t there. Georgina had turned
away and pretended that she wasn&rsquo;t watching
but she was, and for a moment she felt that the sun
had gone behind a cloud, Barby looked so disappointed.

But it was only for a moment, for Barby immediately
began to tell about an amusing experience she had
on her way home, and started upstairs to take off
her hat, with Georgina tagging after to ask a thousand
questions, just as she had been tagging ever since.

And later she had thrown her arms arpund her mother,
exclaiming as she held her fast, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
changed a single bit, Barby,&rdquo; and Barby answered
gaily:

&ldquo;What did you expect, dearest, in a few short
weeks? White hair and spectacles?&rdquo;

&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a few short
weeks,&rdquo; sighed Georgina. &ldquo;It seems as
if years full of things had happened, and that I&rsquo;m
as old as you are.&rdquo;

Now as Uncle Darcy recounted some of these happenings,
and Barby realized how many strange experiences Georgina
had lived through during her absence, how many new
acquaintances she had made and how much she had been
allowed to go about by herself, she understood why
the child felt so much older. She understood still
better that night as she sat brushing Georgina&rsquo;s
curls. The little girl on the footstool at her knee
was beginning to reach up--was beginning to ask questions
about the strange grown-up world whose sayings and
doings are always so puzzling to little heads.

&ldquo;Barby,&rdquo; she asked hesitatingly, &ldquo;what
do people mean exactly, when they say they have other
fish to fry?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, just other business to attend to or something
else they&rsquo;d rather do.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But when they shrug their shoulders at the
same time,&rdquo; persisted Georgina.

&ldquo;A shrug can stand for almost anything,&rdquo;
answered Barby. &ldquo;Sometimes it says meaner things
than words can convey.&rdquo;

Then came the inevitable question which made Georgina
wish that she had not spoken.

&ldquo;But why do you ask, dear? Tell me how the expression
was used, and I can explain better.&rdquo;

Now Georgina could not understand why she had brought
up the subject. It had been uppermost in her mind
all evening, but every time it reached the tip of
her tongue she drove it back. That is, until this last
time. Then it seemed to say itself. Having gone this
far she could not lightly change the subject as an
older person might have done. Barby was waiting for
an answer. It came in a moment, halting but truthful.

&ldquo;That day I was at the Bazaar, you know, and
everybody was saying how nice I looked, dressed up
like a little girl of long ago, I heard Mrs. Whitman
say to Miss Minnis that one would think that Justin
Huntingdon would want to come home once or twice in
a lifetime to see me; and Miss Minnis shrugged her
shoulders, this way, and said:

&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, he has other fish to fry.&rsquo;&rdquo;

Georgina, with her usual aptitude for mimicry, made
the shrug so eloquent that Barby understood exactly
what Miss Minnis intended to convey, and what it had
meant to the wondering child.

&ldquo;Miss Minnis is an old cat!&rdquo; she exclaimed
impatiently. Then she laid down the brush, and gathering
Georgina&rsquo;s curls into one hand, turned her head
so that she could look into the troubled little face.

&ldquo;Tell me, Baby,&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Have
you heard anyone else say things like that?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Georgina, &ldquo;several
times. And yesterday a woman who came into the bakery
while I was getting the rolls Tippy sent me for, asked
me if I was Doctor Huntingdon&rsquo;s little girl.
And when I said yes, she asked me when he was coming
home.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And what did you say?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, I thought she hadn&rsquo;t any right
to ask, specially in the way she made her question
sound. She doesn&rsquo;t belong in this town, anyhow.
She&rsquo;s only one of the summer boarders. So I
drew myself up the way the Duchess always did in &lsquo;The
Fortunes of Romney Tower.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you remember?
and I said, &lsquo;It will probably be some time,
Madam.&rsquo; Then I took up my bag of hot rolls and
marched out. I think that word Madam always sounds
so freezing, when you say it the way the Duchess was
always doing.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, you ridiculous baby!&rdquo; exclaimed Barby,
clasping her close and kissing her again and again.
Then seeing the trouble still lingering in the big
brown eyes, she took the little face between her hands
and looked into it long and intently, as if reading
her thoughts.

&ldquo;Georgina,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;I
understand now, what is the matter. You&rsquo;re wondering
the same thing about your father that these busybodies
are. It&rsquo;s my fault though. I took it for granted
that you understood about his long absence. I never
dreamed that it was hurting you in any way.&rdquo;

Georgina hid her face in Barby&rsquo;s lap, her silence
proof enough that her mother had guessed aright. For
a moment or two Barby&rsquo;s hand strayed caressingly
over the bowed head. Then she said:

&ldquo;I wonder if you remember this old story I used
to tell you, beginning, &rsquo;St. George of Merry
England was the youngest and the bravest of the seven
champions of Christendom. Clad in bright armor with
his magic sword Ascalon by his side, he used to travel
on his war horse in far countries in search of adventure.&rsquo;
Do you remember that?&rdquo;

Georgina nodded yes without raising her head.

&ldquo;Then you remember he came to a beach where
the Princess Saba called to him to flee, because the
Dragon, the most terrible monster ever seen on earth,
was about to come up out of the sea and destroy the
city. Every year it came up to do this, and only the
sacrifice of a beautiful maiden could stop it from
destroying the people.

&ldquo;But undismayed, Saint George refused to flee.
He stayed on and fought the dragon, and wounded it,
and bound it with the maiden&rsquo;s sash and led
it into the market place where it was finally killed.
And the people were forever freed from the terrible
monster because of his prowess. Do you remember all
that?&rdquo;

Again Georgina nodded. She knew the story well. Every
Christmas as far back as she could remember she had
eaten her bit of plum pudding from a certain rare
old blue plate, on which was the picture of Saint George,
the dragon and the Princess. &ldquo;Nowadays,&rdquo;
Barby went on, &ldquo;because men do not ride around
&lsquo;clad in bright armor,&rsquo; doing knightly
deeds, people do not recognize them as knights. But
your father is doing something that is just as great
and just as brave as any of the deeds of any knight
who ever drew a sword. Over in foreign ports where
he has been stationed, is a strange disease which
seems to rise out of the marshes every year, just
as the dragon did, and threaten the health and the
lives of the people. It is especially bad on shipboard,
and it is really harder to fight than a real dragon
would be, because it is an invisible foe, a sickness
that comes because of a tiny, unseen microbe.

&ldquo;Your father has watched it, year after year,
attacking not only the sailors of foreign navies but
our own men, when they have to live in those ports,
and he made up his mind to go on a quest for this invisible
monster, and kill it if possible. It is such a very
important quest that the Government was glad to grant
him a year&rsquo;s leave of absence from the service.

&ldquo;He was about to come home to see us first,
when he met an old friend, a very wealthy Englishman,
who has spent the greater part of his life collecting
rare plants and studying their habits. He has written
several valuable books on Botany, and the last ten
years he has been especially interested in the plants
of China. He was getting ready to go to the very places
that your father was planning to visit, and he had
with him an interpreter and a young American assistant.
When he invited your father to join him it was an
opportunity too great to be refused. This Mr. Bowles
is familiar with the country and the people, even speaks
the language himself a little. He had letters to many
of the high officials, and could be of the greatest
assistance to your father in many ways, even though
he did not stay with the party. He could always be
in communication with it.

&ldquo;So, of course, he accepted the invitation.
It is far better for the quest and far better for
himself to be with such companions.

&ldquo;I am not uneasy about him, knowing he has friends
within call in case of sickness and accident, and
he will probably be able to accomplish his purpose
more quickly with the help they will be able to give.
You know he has to go off into all sorts of dirty,
uncomfortable places, risk his own health and safety,
go among the sick and suffering where he can watch
the progress of the disease under different conditions.

&ldquo;The whole year may be spent in a vain search,
with nothing to show for it at the end, and even if
he is successful and finds the cause of this strange
illness and a remedy, his only reward will be the satisfaction
of knowing he has done something to relieve the suffering
of his fellow-creatures. People can understand the
kind of bravery that shows. If he were rescuing one
person from a burning house or a sinking boat they
would cry out, &lsquo;What a hero.&rsquo; But they
don&rsquo;t seem to appreciate this kind of rescue
work. It will do a thousand times more good, because
it will free the whole navy from the teeth of the
dragon.

&ldquo;If there were a war, people would not expect
him to come home. We are giving him up to his country
now, just as truly as if he were in the midst of battle.
A soldier&rsquo;s wife and a soldier&rsquo;s daughter--it
is the proof of our love and loyalty, Georgina, to
bear his long absence cheerfully, no matter how hard
that is to do; to be proud that he can serve his country
if not with his sword, with the purpose and prowess
of a Saint George.&rdquo;

Barby&rsquo;s eyes were wet but there was a starry
light in them, as she lifted Georgina&rsquo;s head
and kissed her. Two little arms were thrown impulsively
around her neck.

&ldquo;Oh, Barby! I&rsquo;m so sorry that I didn&rsquo;t
know all that before! I didn&rsquo;t understand, and
I felt real ugly about it when I heard people whispering
and saying things as if he didn&rsquo;t love us any
more. And--when I said my prayers at bedtime--I didn&rsquo;t
sing &lsquo;Eternal Father Strong to Save&rsquo; a
single night while you were gone.&rdquo;

Comforting arms held her close.

&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you write and tell mother
about it?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to make you feel bad. I
was afraid from what Cousin Mehitable said you were
going to _die_. I worried and worried over
it. Oh, I had the miserablest time!&rdquo;

Another kiss interrupted her. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll
never do that way again, Georgina. Promise me that
no matter what happens you&rsquo;ll come straight to
me and have it set right.&rdquo;

The promise was given, with what remorse and penitence
no one could know but Georgina, recalling the letter
she had written, beginning with a stern &ldquo;Dear
Sir.&rdquo; But to justify herself, she asked after
the hair-brushing had begun again:

&ldquo;But Barby, why has he stayed away from home
four whole years? He wasn&rsquo;t hunting dragons
before this, was he?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, but I thought you understood that, too.
He didn&rsquo;t come back here to the Cape because
there were important things which kept him in Washington
during his furloughs. Maybe you were too small to remember
that the time you and I were spending the summer in
Kentucky he had planned to join us there. But he wired
that his best friend in the Navy, an old Admiral, was
at the point of death, and didn&rsquo;t want him to
leave him. The Admiral had befriended him in so many
ways when he first went into the service that there
was nothing else for your father to do but stay with
him as long as he was needed. You were only six then,
and I was afraid the long, hot trip might make you
sick, so I left you with mamma while I went on for
several weeks. Surely you remember something of that
time.&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, just being in Kentucky is all I remember,
and your going away for a while.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And the next time some business affairs of
his own kept him in Washington, something very important.
You were just getting over the measles and I didn&rsquo;t
dare take you, so you stayed with Tippy. So you see
it wasn&rsquo;t your father&rsquo;s fault that he didn&rsquo;t
see you. He had expected you to be brought down to
Washington.&rdquo;

Georgina pondered over the explanation a while, then
presently said with a sigh, &ldquo;Goodness me, how
easy it is to look at things the wrong way.&rdquo;

Soon after her voice blended with Barby&rsquo;s in
a return to the long neglected bedtime rite:

&ldquo;Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee,
For those in peril on the sea.&rdquo;

Afterward, her troubles all smoothed and explained
away, she lay in the dark, comforted and at peace
with the world. Once a little black doubt thrust its
head up like a snake, to remind her of Melindy&rsquo;s
utterance, &ldquo;When a man _wants_ to
write, he&rsquo;s gwine to write, busy or no busy.&rdquo;
But even that found an explanation in her thoughts.

Of course, Melindy meant just ordinary men, Not those
who had great deeds to do in the world like her father.
Probably Saint George himself hadn&rsquo;t written
to his family often, if he had a family. He couldn&rsquo;t
be expected to. He had &ldquo;other fish to fry,&rdquo;
and it was perfectly right and proper for him to put
his mind on the frying of them to the neglect of everything
else.

The four months&rsquo; long silence was unexplained
save for this comforting thought, but Georgina worried
about it no longer. Up from below came the sound of
keys touched softly as Barby sang an old lullaby. She
sang it in a glad, trustful sort of way,

&ldquo;He is far across the sea,
But he&rsquo;s coming home to me,
Baby mine!&rdquo;

Lying there in the dark, Georgina composed another
letter to send after her first one, and next morning
this is what she wrote, sitting up in the willow tree
with a magazine on her knees for a writing table:

&ldquo;Dearest Father: I am sorry that I wrote that
last letter, because everything is different from
what I thought it was. I did not know until Barby
came home and told me, that you are just as brave as
St. George was, clad in bright armor, when he went
to rescue the people from the dragon. I hope you get
the monster that comes up out of the sea every year
after the poor sailors. Barby says we are giving you
to our country in this way, as much as if there was
war, so now I&rsquo;m prouder of having a St.-George-and-the-dragon-kind
of a father than one like Peggy Burrell&rsquo;s, even
if she does know him well enough to call him &lsquo;Dad-o&rsquo;-my-heart.&rsquo;
Even if people don&rsquo;t understand, and say things
about your never coming home to see us, we are going
to &lsquo;still bear up and steer right onward,&rsquo;
because that&rsquo;s our line to live by. And we hope
as hard as we can every day, that you&rsquo;ll get
the mike-robe you are in kwest of. Your loving little
daughter, Georgina Huntingdon.&rdquo;

Chapter XXVIII
The Doctor&rsquo;s Discovery

In due time the letter written in the willow tree
reached the city of Hong-Kong, and was carried to
the big English hotel, overlooking the loveliest of
Chinese harbors. But it was not delivered to Doctor
Huntingdon. It was piled on top of all the other mail
which lay there, awaiting his return. Under it was
Georgina&rsquo;s first letter to him and the one she
had written to her mother about Dan Darcy and the rifle.
And under that was the one which Barbara called the
&ldquo;rainbow letter,&rdquo; and then at least half
a dozen from Barbara herself, with the beautiful colored
photograph of the Towncrier and his lass. Also there
were several bundles of official-looking documents
and many American newspapers.

Nothing had been forwarded to him for two months,
because he had left instructions to hold his mail
until further notice. The first part of that time
he was moving constantly from one out-of-the-way place
to another where postal delivery was slow and uncertain.
The last part of that time he was lying ill in the
grip of the very disease which he had gone out to
study and to conquer.

He was glad then to be traveling in the wake of the
friendly old Englishman and his party. Through their
interpreter, arrangements were made to have him carried
to one of the tents of a primitive sort of a hospital,
kept by some native missionaries. The Englishman&rsquo;s
young assistant went with him. He was a quiet fellow
whom Mr. Bowles had jokingly dubbed David the silent,
because it was so hard to make him talk. But Doctor
Huntingdon, a reserved, silent man himself, had been
attracted to him by that very trait.

During the months they had been thrown together so
much, Dave had taken great interest in the Doctor&rsquo;s
reports of the experiments he was making in treating
the disease. When the Doctor was told that Mr. Bowles
had gone back to the coast, having found what he wanted
and made his notes for his next book, and consequently
Dave was free to stay and nurse him, he gave a sigh
of relief.

Dave stopped his thanks almost gruffly.

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than one reason for my staying,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sick among strangers
in a strange country, myself, and I know how it feels.
Besides, I&rsquo;m interested in seeing if this new
treatment of yours works out on a white man as well
as it did on these natives. I&rsquo;ll be doing as
much in the way of scientific research, keeping a chart
on you, as if I were taking notes for Mr. Bowles.&rdquo;

That was a long speech for Dave, the longest that
he made during the Doctor&rsquo;s illness. But in
the days which followed, one might well have wondered
if there was not a greater reason than those he offered
for such devoted attendance. He was always within
call, always so quick to notice a want that usually
a wish was gratified before it could be expressed.
His was a devotion too constant to be prompted merely
by sympathy for a fellow-country-man or interest in
medical experiments.

Once, when the Doctor was convalescing, he opened
his eyes to find his silent attendant sitting beside
him reading, and studied him for some time, unobserved.

&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; he said, after watching him a
while--&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the queerest thing-- lately
every time I look at you I&rsquo;m reminded of home.
You must resemble someone I used to know back there,
but for the life of me I can&rsquo;t recall who.&rdquo;

Dave answered indifferently, without glancing up from
the page.

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s probably a thousand fellows that
look like me. I&rsquo;m medium height and about every
third person you see back in the States has gray eyes
like mine, and just the ordinary every-day sort of
features that I have.&rdquo;

The Doctor made no answer. It never would have occurred
to him to tell Dave in what way his face differed
from the many others of his type. There was a certain
kindliness of twinkle in the gray eyes at times, and
always a straightforward honesty of gaze that made
one instinctively trust him. There was strength of
purpose in the resolute set of his mouth, and one
could not imagine him being turned back on any road
which he had made up his mind to travel to the end.

Several days after that when the Doctor was sitting
up outside the tent, the resemblance to someone whom
he could not recall, puzzled him again. Dave was whittling,
his lips pursed up as he whistled softly in an absent-minded
sort of way.

&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; exclaimed the Doctor, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
something in the way you sit there, whittling and
whistling that brings little old Provincetown right
up before my eyes. I can see old Captain Ames sitting
there on the wharf on a coil of rope, whittling just
as you are doing, and joking with Sam and the crew
as they pile into the boat to go out to the weirs.
I can see the nets spread out to dry alongshore, and
smell tar and codfish as plain as if it were here
right under my nose. And down in Fishburn Court there&rsquo;s
the little house that was always a second home to me,
with Uncle Darcy pottering around in the yard, singing
his old sailors&rsquo; songs.&rdquo;

The Doctor closed his eyes and drew in a long, slow
breath.

&ldquo;Um! There&rsquo;s the most delicious smell
coming out of that kitchen-- blueberry pies that Aunt
Elspeth&rsquo;s baking. What wouldn&rsquo;t I give
this minute for one of those good, juicy blueberry
pies of hers, smoking hot. I can smell it clear over
here in China. There never was anything in the world
that tasted half so good. I was always tagging around
after Uncle Darcy, as I called him. He was the Towncrier,
and one of those staunch, honest souls who make you
believe in the goodness of God and man no matter what
happens to shake the foundations of your faith.&rdquo;

The Doctor opened his eyes and looked up inquiringly,
startled by the knocking over of the stool on which
Dave had been sitting. He had risen abruptly and gone
inside the tent.

&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he called back. &ldquo;I can
hear you.&rdquo; He seemed to be looking for something,
for he was striding up and down in its narrow space.
The Doctor raised his voice a trifle.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I had to say. I didn&rsquo;t
intend to bore you talking about people and places
you never heard of. But it just came over me in a big
wave--that feeling of homesickness that makes you feel
you&rsquo;ve got to get back or die. Did you ever
have it?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the answer in an indifferent
tone. &ldquo;Several times.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s got me now, right by the throat.&rdquo;

Presently he called, &ldquo;Dave, while you&rsquo;re
in there I wish you&rsquo;d look in my luggage and
see what newspapers are folded up with it. I have a
dim recollection that a _Provincetown Advocate_
came about the time I was taken sick and I never opened
it.

&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he exclaimed when
Dave emerged presently, holding out the newspaper.
&ldquo;Look at the cut across the top of the first
page. Old Provincetown itself. It&rsquo;s more for
the name of the town printed across that picture of
the harbor than for the news that I keep on taking
the paper. Ordinarily, I never do more than glance
at the news items, but there&rsquo;s time to-day to
read even the advertisements. You&rsquo;ve no idea
how good those familiar old names look to me.&rdquo;

He read some of them aloud, smiling over the memories
they awakened. But he read without an auditor, for
Dave found he had business with one of the missionaries,
and put off to attend to it. On his return he was
greeted with the announcement:

&ldquo;Dave, I want to get out of here. I&rsquo;m
sure there must be a big pile of mail waiting for
me right now in Hong-Kong, and I&rsquo;m willing to
risk the trip. Let&rsquo;s start back to-morrow.&rdquo;

Several days later they were in Hong-Kong, enjoying
the luxuries of civilization in the big hotel. Still
weak from his recent illness and fatigued by the hardships
of his journey, Doctor Huntingdon did not go down
to lunch the day of their arrival. It was served in
his room, and as he ate he stopped at intervals to
take another dip into the pile of mail which had been
brought up to him.

In his methodical way he opened the letters in the
order of their arrival, beginning with the one whose
postmark showed the earliest date. It took a long
time to finish eating on account of these pauses. Hop
Ching was bringing in his coffee when Dave came back,
having had not only his lunch in the diningroom, but
a stroll through the streets afterward. He found Doctor
Huntingdon with a photograph propped up in front of
him, studying it intently while Hop Ching served the
coffee. The Doctor passed the photograph to Dave.

&ldquo;Take it over to the window where you can get
a good light on it,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
that a peach of a picture? That&rsquo;s my little daughter
and the old friend I&rsquo;m always quoting. The two
seem to be as great chums as he and I used to be.
I don&rsquo;t want to bore you, Dave, but I would like
to read you this letter that she wrote to her mother,
and her mother sent on to me. In the first place I&rsquo;m
proud of her writing such a letter. I had no idea
she could express herself so well, and secondly the
subject matter makes it an interesting document.

&ldquo;On my little girl&rsquo;s birthday Uncle Darcy
took her out in his boat, _The Betsey_.
The name of that old boat certainly does sound good
to me! He told her--but wait! I&rsquo;d rather read
it to you in her own words. It&rsquo;ll give you such
a good idea of the old man. Perhaps I ought to explain
that he Had a son who got into trouble some ten years
ago, and left home. He was just a little chap when
I saw him last, hardly out of dresses, the fall I
left home for college.

&ldquo;Uncle Darcy and Aunt Elspeth were fairly foolish
about him. He had come into their lives late, you
see, after their older children died. I don&rsquo;t
believe it would make any difference to them what he&rsquo;d
do. They would welcome him back from the very gallows
if he&rsquo;d only come. His mother never has believed
he did anything wrong, and the hope of the old man&rsquo;s
life is that his &lsquo;Danny,&rsquo; as he calls him,
will make good in some way--do something to wipe out
the stain on his name and come back to him.&rdquo;

The Doctor paused as if waiting for some encouragement
to read.

&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to hear it, best in the world.&rdquo;

He turned his chair so that he could look out of the
window at the harbor. The Chinese sampans of every
color were gliding across the water like a flock of
gaily-hued swans. He seemed to be dividing his attention
between those native boats and the letter when the
Doctor first began to read. It was Georgina&rsquo;s
rainbow letter, and the colors of the rainbow were
repeated again and again by the reds and yellows and
blues of that fleet of sampans.

But as the Doctor read on Dave listened more intently,
so intently, in fact, that he withdrew his attention
entirely from the window, and leaning forward, buried
his face in his hands, his elbows resting on his knees.
The Doctor found him in this attitude when he looked
up at the end, expecting some sort of comment. He
was used to Dave&rsquo;s silences, but he had thought
this surely would call forth some remark. Then as he
studied the bowed figure, it flashed into his mind
that the letter must have touched some chord in the
boy&rsquo;s own past. Maybe Dave had an old father
somewhere, longing for his return, and the memory was
breaking him all up.

Silently, the Doctor turned aside to the pile of letters
still unread. Georgina&rsquo;s stern little note beginning
&ldquo;Dear Sir&rdquo; was the next in order and was
in such sharp contrast to the loving, intimate way
she addressed her mother, that he felt the intended
reproach of it, even while it amused and surprised
him. But it hurt a little. It wasn&rsquo;t pleasant
to have his only child regard him as a stranger. It
was fortunate that the next letter was the one in
which she hastened to call him &ldquo;a Saint-George-and-the-dragon
sort of father.&rdquo;

When he read Barbara&rsquo;s explanation of his long
silence and Georgina&rsquo;s quick acceptance of it,
he wanted to take them both in his arms and tell them
how deeply he was touched by their love and loyalty;
that he hadn&rsquo;t intended to be neglectful of
them or so absorbed in his work that he put it first
in his life. But it was hard for him to put such things
into words, either written or spoken. He had left
too much to be taken for granted he admitted remorsefully
to himself.

For a long time he sat staring sternly into space.
So people had been gossiping about him, had they?
And Barbara and the baby had heard the whispers and
been hurt by them----He&rsquo;d go home and put a stop
to it. He straightened himself up and turned to report
his sudden decision to Dave. But the chair by the
window was empty. The Doctor glanced over his shoulder.
Dave had changed his seat and was sitting behind him.
They were back to back, but a mirror hung in such
a way the Doctor could see Dave&rsquo;s face.

With arms crossed on a little table in front of him,
he was leaning forward for another look at the photograph
which he had propped up against a vase. A hungry yearning
was in his face as he bent towards it, gazing into
it as if he could not look his fill. Suddenly his head
went down on his crossed arms in such a hopeless fashion
that in a flash Doctor Huntingdon divined the reason,
and recognized the resemblance that had haunted him.
Now he understood why the boy had stayed behind to
nurse him. Now a dozen trifling incidents that had
seemed of no importance to him at the time, confirmed
his suspicion.

His first impulse was to Cry out &ldquo;Dan!&rdquo;
but his life-long habit of repression checked him.
He felt he had no right to intrude on the privacy
which the boy guarded so jealously. But Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s
son! Off here in a foreign land, bowed down with remorse
and homesickness! How he must have been tortured with
all that talk of the old town and its people!

A great wave of pity and yearning tenderness swept
through the Doctor&rsquo;s heart as he sat twisted
around in his chair, staring at that reflection in
the mirror. He was uncertain what he ought to do. He
longed to go to him with some word of comfort, but
he shrank from the thought of saying anything which
would seem an intrusion.

Finally he rose, and walking across the room, laid
his hand on the bowed shoulder with a sympathetic
pressure.

&ldquo;Look here, my boy,&rdquo; he said, in his deep,
quiet voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you what
the trouble is, but whatever it is you&rsquo;ll let
me help you, won&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;ve given me
the right to ask that by all you&rsquo;ve done for
me. Anything I could do would be only too little for
one who has stood by me the way you have. I want you
to feel that I&rsquo;m your friend in the deepest
meaning of that word. You can count on me for anything.&rdquo;
Then in a lighter tone as he gave the shoulder a half-playful
slap he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m _for_ you,
son.&rdquo;

The younger man raised his head and straightened himself
up in his chair.

&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;if you knew who I am.&rdquo; Then he blurted
out the confession: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dan Darcy. I can&rsquo;t
let you go on believing in me when you talk like that.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But I knew it when I said what I did,&rdquo;
interrupted Doctor Huntingdon. &ldquo;It flashed over
me first when I saw you looking at your father&rsquo;s
picture. No man could look at a stranger&rsquo;s face
that way. Then I knew what the resemblance was that
has puzzled me ever since I met you. The only wonder
to me is that I did not see it long ago.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You knew it,&rdquo; repeated Dan slowly, &ldquo;and
yet you told me to count you as a friend in the deepest
meaning of that word. How could you mean it?&rdquo;

The Doctor&rsquo;s answer came with deep impressiveness.

&ldquo;Because, despite whatever slip you may have
made as a boy of eighteen, you have grown into a man
worthy of such a friendship. A surgeon in my position
learns to read character, learns to know an honest
man when he sees one. No matter what lies behind you
that you regret, I have every confidence in you now,
Dan. I am convinced you are worthy to be the son of
even such a man as Daniel Darcy.&rdquo;

He held out his hand to have it taken in a long, silent
grip that made it ache.

&ldquo;Come on and go back home with me,&rdquo; urged
the Doctor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made good out here.
Do the brave thing now and go back and live down the
past. It&rsquo;ll make the old folks so happy it&rsquo;ll
wipe out the heart-break of all those years that you&rsquo;ve
been away.&rdquo;

Dan&rsquo;s only response was another grasp of the
Doctor&rsquo;s hand as strong and as painful as the
first. Pulling himself up by it he stood an instant
trying to say something, then, too overcome to utter
a word, made a dash for the door.

Doctor Huntingdon was so stirred by the scene that
he found it difficult to go back to his letters, but
the very next one in order happened to be the one
Georgina wrote to her mother just after Belle had given
her consent to Barby&rsquo;s being told of Emmett&rsquo;s
confession. He read the latter part of it, standing,
for he had sprung to his feet with the surprise of
its opening sentence. He did not even know that Emmett
had been dead all these years, and Dan, who had had
no word from home during all his absence, could not
know it either. He was in a tremor of eagerness to
hurry to him with the news, but he waited to scan the
rest of the letter.

Then with it fluttering open in his hand he strode
across the hall and burst into Dan&rsquo;s room without
knocking.

&ldquo;Pack up your junk, this minute, boy,&rdquo;
he shouted. &ldquo;We take the first boat out of here
for home. Look at this!&rdquo;

He thrust Georgina&rsquo;s letter before Dan&rsquo;s
bewildered eyes.

Chapter XXIX
While they Waited

&ldquo;There comes the boy from the telegraph office.&rdquo;
Mrs. Triplett spoke with such a raven-like note of
foreboding in her voice that Georgina, practising
her daily scales, let her hands fall limply from the
keys.

&ldquo;The Tishbite!&rdquo; she thought uneasily.
What evil was it about to send into the house now,
under cover of that yellow envelope? Would it take
Barby away from her as it had done before?

Sitting motionless on the piano stool, she waited
in dread while Mrs. Triplett hurried to the door before
the boy could ring, signed for the message and silently
bore it upstairs. The very fact that she went up with
it herself, instead of calling to Barby that a message
had come, gave Georgina the impression that it contained
bad news.

&ldquo;A _cablegram_ for me?&rdquo; she
heard Barby ask. Then there was a moment&rsquo;s silence
in which she knew the message was being opened and
read. Then there was a murmur as if she were reading
it aloud to Tippy and then--an excited whirlwind of
a Barby flying down the stairs, her eyes like happy
stars, her arms outstretched to gather Georgina into
them, and her voice half laugh, half sob, singing:

&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s coming home to me
Baby mine!&rdquo;

Never before had Georgina seen her so radiant, so
excited, so overflowingly happy that she gave vent
to her feelings as a little schoolgirl might have
done. Seizing Georgina in her arms she waltzed her
around the room until she was dizzy. Coming to a pause
at the piano stool she seated herself and played,
&ldquo;The Year of Jubilee Has Come,&rdquo; in deep,
crashing chords and trickly little runs and trills,
till the old tune was transformed into a paen of jubilation.

Then she took the message from her belt, where she
had tucked it and re-read it to assure herself of
its reality.

&ldquo;Starting home immediately. Stay three months,
dragon captured.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That must mean that his quest has been fairly
successful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s
found the cause of the disease it&rsquo;ll be only
a matter of time till he finds how to kill it.&rdquo;

Then she looked up, puzzled.

&ldquo;How strange for him to call it the _dragon_.
How could he know we&rsquo;d understand, and that
we&rsquo;ve been calling it that?&rdquo;

Georgina&rsquo;s time had come for confession.

&ldquo;Oh, I wrote him a little note after you told
me the story and told him I was proud of having a
Saint-George-kind of a father, and that we hoped every
day he&rsquo;d get the microbe.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You darling!&rdquo; exclaimed Barbara, drawing
her to her for another impulsive hug. She did not
ask as Georgina was afraid she would:

&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you were writing
to your father?&rdquo; Barbara understood, without
asking, remembering the head bowed in her lap after
that confession of her encounter with the prying stranger
in the bakery.

Suddenly Georgina asked:

&ldquo;Barby, what is the &lsquo;Tishbite?&rsquo;&rdquo;

&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; echoed Barby, wrinkling her
forehead in perplexity.

&ldquo;The Tishbite. Don&rsquo;t you know it says
in the Bible, Elijah and the Tishbite----&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, no, dear, you&rsquo;ve turned it around,
and put the and in the wrong place. It is &lsquo;And
Elijah the Tishbite,&rsquo; just as we&rsquo;d say
William the Norman or Manuel the Portuguese.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, for pity sakes!&rdquo; drawled Georgina
in a long, slow breath of relief. &ldquo;Is that all?
I wish I&rsquo;d known it long ago. It would have saved
me a lot of scary feelings.&rdquo;

Then she told how she had made the wish on the star
and tried to prove it as Belle had taught her, by
opening the Bible at random.

&ldquo;If you had read on,&rdquo; said Barby, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
have found what it meant your own self.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But the book shut up before I had a chance,&rdquo;
explained Georgina. &ldquo;And I never could find
the place again, although I&rsquo;ve hunted and hunted.
And I was sure it meant some sort of devil, and that
it would come and punish me for using the Bible that
way as if it were a hoodoo.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you ask me?&rdquo; insisted
Barby. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another time you see,
when a big worry and misunderstanding could have been
cleared away with a word. To think of your living
in dread all that time, when the Tishbite was only
a good old prophet whose presence brought a blessing
to the house which sheltered him.&rdquo;

That night when Georgina&rsquo;s curls were being
brushed she said, &ldquo;Barby, I know now who my
Tishbite is; it&rsquo;s Captain Kidd. He&rsquo;s brought
a blessing ever since he came to this town. If it
hadn&rsquo;t been for his barking that day we were
playing in the garage I wouldn&rsquo;t be here now
to tell the tale. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for him
I wouldn&rsquo;t have known Richard, and we&rsquo;d
never have started to playing pirate. And if we hadn&rsquo;t
played pirate Richard wouldn&rsquo;t have asked to
borrow the rifle, and if he hadn&rsquo;t asked we
never would have found the note hidden in the stock,
and if we hadn&rsquo;t found the note nobody would
have known that Danny was innocent. Then if Captain
Kidd hadn&rsquo;t found the pouch we wouldn&rsquo;t
have seen the compass that led to finding the wild-cat
woman who told us that Danny was alive and well.&rdquo;

&ldquo;What a House-That-Jack-Built sort of tale that
was!&rdquo; exclaimed Barby, much amused. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to do something in Captain Kidd&rsquo;s honor.
Give him a party perhaps, and light up the holiday
tree.&rdquo;

The usual bedtime ceremonies were over, and Barby
had turned out the light and reached the door when
Georgina raised herself on her elbow to call:

&ldquo;Barby, I&rsquo;ve just thought of it. The wish
I made on that star that night is beginning to come
true. Nearly everybody I know is happy about something.&rdquo;
Then she snuggled her head down on the pillow with
a little wriggle of satisfaction. &ldquo;Ugh! this
is such a good world. I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;m
living in it. Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;

And Barby had to come all the way back in the dark
to emphasize her heartfelt &ldquo;yes, indeed,&rdquo;
with a hug, and to seal the restless eyelids down
with a kiss--the only way to make them stay shut.

Richard came back the next day. He brought a picture
to Georgina from Mr. Locke. It was the copy of the
illustration he had promised her, the fairy shallop
with its sails set wide, coming across a sea of Dreams,
and at the prow, white-handed Hope, the angel girt
with golden wings, which swept back over the sides
of the vessel.

&ldquo;Think of having a painting by the famous Milford
Norris Locke!&rdquo; exclaimed Barby. She hung over
it admiringly. &ldquo;Most people would be happy to
have just his autograph.&rdquo; She bent nearer to
examine the name in the corner of the picture. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
this underneath? Looks like number IV.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, that means he&rsquo;s number four in our
Rainbow Club. Peggy Burrell is number five and the
Captain is number six. That&rsquo;s all the members
we have so far.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to count me in?&rdquo;
asked Barby.

&ldquo;Oh, you _are_ counted in. You&rsquo;ve
belonged from the beginning. We made you an _honary_
member or whatever it is they call it, people who
deserve to belong because they&rsquo;re always doing
nice things, but don&rsquo;t know it. There&rsquo;s
you and Uncle Darcy and Captain Kidd, because he saved
our lives and saved our families from having to have
a double funeral.&rdquo;

Barby stooped to take the little terrier&rsquo;s head
between her hands and pat-a-cake it back and forth
with an affectionate caress.

&ldquo;Captain Kidd,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;you
shall have a party this very night, and there shall
be bones and cakes on the holiday tree, and you shall
be the best man with a &rsquo;normous blue bow on
your collar, and we&rsquo;ll all dance around in your
honor this way.&rdquo;

Springing to her feet and holding the terrier&rsquo;s
front paws, she waltzed him around and around on his
hind legs, singing:

&ldquo;All around the barberry bush,
Barberry bush, barberry bush.
All around the barberry bush
So early in the morning.&rdquo;

Georgina, accustomed all her life to such frisky performances,
took it as a matter of course that Barby should give
vent to her feelings in the same way that she herself
would have done, but Richard stood by, bewildered.
It was a revelation to him that anybody&rsquo;s mother
could be so charmingly and unreservedly gay. She seemed
more like a big sister than any of the mothers of
his acquaintance. He couldn&rsquo;t remember his own,
and while Aunt Letty was always sweet and good to
him he couldn&rsquo;t imagine her waltzing a dog around
on its hind legs any more than he could imagine Mrs.
Martha Washington doing it.

The holiday tree was another revelation to him, when
he came back at dusk to find it lighted with the colored
lanterns and blooming with flags and hung with surprises
for Georgina and himself.

&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never seen it lighted,&rdquo;
Barby explained, &ldquo;and Georgina&rsquo;s birthday
had to be skipped because I wasn&rsquo;t here to celebrate,
so we&rsquo;ve rolled all the holidays into one, for
a grand celebration in Captain Kidd&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;

It was to shorten the time of waiting that Barbara
threw herself into the children&rsquo;s games and
pleasures so heartily. Every night she tore a leaf
off the calendar and planned something to fill up the
next day to the brim with work or play. They climbed
to the top of the monument when she found that Richard
had never made the ascent, and stood long, looking
off to Plymouth, twenty miles away, and at the town
spread out below them, seeming from their great height,
a tiny toy village. They went to Truro to see the
bayberry candle-dipping. They played Maud Muller, raking
the yard, because the boy whom old Jeremy had installed
in his place had hurt his foot. Old Jeremy, being
well on toward ninety now, no longer attempted any
work, though still hale and hearty. But the garden
had been his especial domain too long for him to give
it up entirely, and he spent hours in it daily, to
the disgust of his easy-going successor.

There were picnics at Highland Light and the Race
Point life-saving station. There were long walks out
the state road, through the dunes and by the cranberry
bogs. But everything which speeded Barbara&rsquo;s
weeks of feverish waiting, hurrying her on nearer
her heart&rsquo;s desire, brought Richard nearer ito
the time of parting from the old seaport town and the
best times he had ever known. He had kodak pictures
of all their outings. Most of them were light-struck
or out of focus or over-exposed, but he treasured
them because he had taken them himself with his first
little Brownie camera. There was nothing wrong or
queer with the recollection of the scenes they brought
to him. His memory photographed only perfect days,
and he dreaded to have them end.

Before those weeks were over Richard began to feel
that he belonged to Barby in a way, and she to him.
There were many little scenes of which no snapshot
could be taken, which left indelible impressions.

For instance, those evenings in the dim room lighted
only by the moonlight streaming in through the open
windows, when Barby sat at the piano with Georgina
beside her, singing, while he looked out over the sea
and felt the soul of him stir vaguely, as if he had
wings somewhere, waiting to be unfurled.

The last Sunday of his vacation he went to church
with Barbara and Georgina. It wasn&rsquo;t the Church
of the Pilgrims, but another white-towered one near
by. The president of the bank was one of the ushers.
He called Richard by name when he shook hands with
the three of them at the door. That in itself gave
Richard a sense of importance and of being welcome.
It was a plain old-fashioned church, its only decoration
a big bowl of tiger-lilies on a table down in front
of the pulpit. When he took his seat in one of the
high front pews he felt that he had never been in such
a quiet, peaceful place before.

They were very early. The windows were open, and now
and then a breeze blowing in from the sea fluttered
the leaves of a hymn-book lying open on the front
seat. Each time they fluttered he heard another sound
also, as faint and sweet as if it were the ringing
of little crystal bells. Georgina, on the other side
of Barby, heard it too, and they looked at each other
questioningly. Then Richard discovered where the tinkle
came from, and pointed upward to call her attention
to it. There, from the center of the ceiling swung
a great, old-fashioned chandelier, hung with a circle
of pendant prisms, each one as large and shining as
the one Uncle Darcy had given her.

Georgina knew better than to whisper in such a place,
but she couldn&rsquo;t help leaning past Barby so
that Richard could see her lips silently form the
words, &ldquo;Rainbow Club.&rdquo; She wondered if
Mr. Gates had started it. There were enough prisms
for nearly every member in the church to claim one.

Barby, reading the silent message of her lips and
guessing that Georgina was wondering over the discovery,
moved her own lips to form the words, &ldquo;just
_honorary_ members.&rdquo;

Georgina nodded her satisfaction. It was good to know
that there were so many of them in the world, all
working for the same end, whether they realized it
or not.

Just before the service began an old lady in the adjoining
pew next to Richard, reached over the partition and
offered him several cloves. He was too astonished
to refuse them and showed them to Barby, not knowing
what to do with them. She leaned down and whispered
behind her fan:

&ldquo;She eats them to keep her awake in church.&rdquo;

Richard had no intention of going to sleep, but he
chewed one up, finding it so hot it almost strangled
him. Every seat was filled in a short time, and presently
a drowsiness crept into the heated air which began
to weave some kind of a spell around him. His shoes
were new and his collar chafed his neck. His eyelids
grew heavier and heavier. He stared at the lilies
till the whole front of the church seemed filled with
them. He looked up at the chandelier and began to
count the prisms, and watch for the times that the
breeze swept across them and set them to tinkling.

Then, the next thing that he knew he was waking from
a long doze on Barby&rsquo;s shoulder. She was fanning
him with slow sweeps of her white-feathered fan which
smelled deliciously of some faint per-fume, and the
man from Boston was singing all alone, something about
still waves and being brought into a haven.

A sense of Sabbath peace and stillness enfolded him,
with the beauty of the music and the lilies, the tinkling
prisms, the faint, warm perfume wafted across his
face by Barby&rsquo;s fan. The memory of it all stayed
with him as something very sacred and sweet, he could
not tell why, unless it was that Barby&rsquo;s shoulder
was such a dear place for a little motherless lad&rsquo;s
head to lie.

Georgina, leaning against Barby on the other side,
half asleep, sat up and straightened her hat when
the anthem began. Being a Huntingdon she could not
turn as some people did and stare up at the choir loft
behind her when that wonderful voice sang alone. She
looked up at the prisms instead, and as she looked
it seemed to her that the voice was the voice of the
white angel Hope, standing at the prow of a boat, its
golden wings sweeping back, as storm-tossed but triumphant,
it brought the vessel in at last to happy anchorage.

The words which the voice sang were the words on which
the rainbow had rested, that day she read them to
Aunt Elspeth: _"So He bringeth them into their
desired haven."_ They had seemed like music then,
but now, rolling upward, as if Hope herself were singing
them at the prow of Life&rsquo;s tossing shallop,
they were more than music. They voiced the joy of
great desire finding great fulfilment.



Chapter XXX
Nearing the End

&ldquo;Old Mr. Potter has had a stroke.&rdquo;

Georgina called the news up to Richard as she paused
at the foot of the Green Stairs on her way to the
net-mender&rsquo;s house.

&ldquo;Belle sent a note over a little while ago and
I&rsquo;m taking the answer back. Come and go with
me.&rdquo;

Richard, who had been trundling Captain Kidd around
on his forefeet in the r&ocirc;le of wheelbarrow, dropped
the dog&rsquo;s hind legs which he had been using
as handles and came jumping down the steps, two at
a time to do her bidding.

&ldquo;Belle&rsquo;s gone over to take care of things,&rdquo;
Georgina explained, with an important air as they
walked along. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man to help nurse
him, but she&rsquo;ll stay on to the end.&rdquo; Her
tone and words were Tippy&rsquo;s own as she made
this announcement.

&ldquo;End of what?&rdquo; asked Richard. &ldquo;And
what&rsquo;s a stroke?&rdquo;

Half an hour earlier Georgina could not have answered
his question, but she explained now with the air of
one who has had a lifetime of experience. It was Mrs.
Triplett&rsquo;s fund she was drawing on, however,
and old Jeremy&rsquo;s. Belle&rsquo;s note had started
them to comparing reminiscences, and out of their
conversation Georgina had gathered many gruesome facts.

&ldquo;You may be going about as well and hearty as
usual, and suddenly it&rsquo;ll strike you to earth
like lightning, and it may leave you powerless to
move for weeks and sometimes even years. You may know
all that&rsquo;s going on around you but not be able
to speak or make a sign. Mr. Potter isn&rsquo;t as
bad as that, but he&rsquo;s speechless. With him the
end may come any time, yet he may linger on for nobody
knows how long.&rdquo;

Richard had often passed the net-mender&rsquo;s cottage
in the machine, and stared in at the old man plying
his twine-shuttle in front of the door. The fact that
he was Emmett&rsquo;s father and ignorant of the secret
which Richard shared, made an object of intense interest
out of an otherwise unattractive and commonplace old
man. Now that interest grew vast and overshadowing
as the children approached the house.

Belle, stepping to the front door when she heard the
gate click, motioned for them to go around to the
back. As they passed an open side window, each looked
in, involuntarily attracted by the sight of a bed drawn
up close to it. Then they glanced at each other, startled
and awed by what they saw, and bumped into each other
in their haste to get by as quickly as possible.

On the bed lay a rigid form, stretched out under a
white counterpane. All that showed of the face above
the bushy whiskers was as waxen looking as if death
had already touched it, but the sunken eyes half open,
showed that they were still in the mysterious hold
of what old Jeremy called a &ldquo;living death.&rdquo;
It was a sight which neither of them could put out
of their minds for days afterward.

Belle met them at the back door, solemn, unsmiling,
her hushed tones adding to the air of mystery which
seemed to shroud the house. As she finished reading
the note a neighbor came in the back way and Belle
asked the children to wait a few minutes. They dropped
down on the grass while Belle, leaning against the
pump, answered Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s questions in low
tones.

She had been up all night, she told Mrs. Brown. Yes,
she was going to stay on till the call came, no matter
whether it was a week or a year. Mrs. Brown spoke
in a hoarse whisper which broke now and then, letting
her natural voice through with startling effect.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly noble of you,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not many who would
put themselves out to do for an old person who hadn&rsquo;t
any claim on them the way you are doing for him. There&rsquo;ll
surely be stars in _your_ crown.&rdquo;

Later, as the children trudged back home, sobered
by all they had seen and heard, Georgina broke the
silence.

&ldquo;Well, I think we ought to put Belle&rsquo;s
name on the very top line of our club book. She ought
to be an honary member--the very honaryest one of
all.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Richard.  &ldquo;You heard
all Mrs. Brown said. Seems to me what she&rsquo;s
doing to give old Mr. Potter a good time is the very
noblest----&rdquo;

There was an amazed look on Richard&rsquo;s face as
he interrupted with the exclamation:

&ldquo;Gee-minee! You don&rsquo;t call what that old
man&rsquo;s having a good time, do you?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s good to what it would be if
Belle wasn&rsquo;t taking care of him. And if she
does as Mrs. Brown says, &rsquo;carries some comfort
into the valley of the shadow for him, making his
last days bright,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t that the very
biggest rainbow anybody could make?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; admitted Richard in a doubtful
tone. &ldquo;Maybe it is if you put it that way.&rdquo;

They walked a few blocks more in silence, then he
said:

&ldquo;I think _Dan_ ought to be an honary
member.&rdquo;

It was Georgina&rsquo;s turn to ask why.

&ldquo;Aw, you know why! Taking the blame on himself
the way he did and everything.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But he made just as bad times for Uncle Darcy
and Aunt Elspeth as he made good times for Mr. Potter
and Emmett. I don&rsquo;t think he has any right to
belong at all.&rdquo;

They argued the question hotly for a few minutes,
coming nearer to a quarrel than they had ever been
before, and only dropping it as they crossed to a
side street which led into the dunes.

&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn here and go home this way,&rdquo;
suggested Richard. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go look at the
place where we buried the pouch and see if the sand
has shifted any.&rdquo;

Nothing was changed, however, except that the holes
they had dug were filled to the level now, and the
sand stretched an unbroken surface as before the day
of their digging.

&ldquo;Cousin James says that if ever the gold comes
to the top we can have it, because he paid the woman.
But if it ever does I won&rsquo;t be here to see it.
I&rsquo;ve got to go home in eight more days.&rdquo;

He stood kicking his toes into the sand as he added
dolefully, &ldquo;Here it is the end of the summer
and we&rsquo;ve only played at being pirates. We&rsquo;ve
never gone after the real stuff in dead earnest, one
single time.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; admitted Georgina. &ldquo;First
we had to wait so long for your portrait to be finished
and then you went off on the yacht, and all in between
times things have happened so fast there never was
any time. But we found something just as good as pirate
stuff--that note in the rifle was worth more to Uncle
Darcy than a chest of gold.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And Captain Kidd was as good as a real pirate,&rdquo;
said Richard, brightening at the thought, &ldquo;for
he brought home a bag of real gold, and was the one
who started us after the wild-cat woman. I guess Uncle
Darcy would rather know what she told him than have
a chest of ducats and pearls.&rdquo;

&ldquo;We can go next summer,&rdquo; suggested Georgina.

&ldquo;Maybe I won&rsquo;t be here next summer. Dad
always wants to try new places on his vacation. He
and Aunt Letty like to move. But I&rsquo;d like to
stay here always. I hate to go away until I find out
the end of things. I wish I could stay until the letter
is found and Dan comes home.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You may be a grown-up man before either of
those things happen,&rdquo; remarked Georgina sagely.

&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;ll be here to
see &rsquo;m,&rdquo; was the triumphant answer, &ldquo;because
when I&rsquo;m a man I&rsquo;m coming back here to
live all the rest of my life. It&rsquo;s the nicest
place there is.&rdquo;

&ldquo;If anything happens sooner I&rsquo;ll write
and tell you,&rdquo; promised Georgina.

Something happened the very next morning, however,
and Georgina kept part of her promise though not in
writing, when she came running up the Green Stairs,
excited and eager. Her news was so tremendously important
that the words tumbled over each other in her haste
to tell it. She could hardly make herself understood.
The gist of it was that a long night letter had just
arrived from her father, saying that he had landed
in San Francisco and was taking the first homeward
bound train. He would stop in Washington for a couple
of days to attend to some business, and then was coming
home for a long visit. And--this was the sentence Georgina
saved till last to electrify Richard with:

&ldquo;_Am bringing Dan with me._&rdquo;

&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say where he found him or anything
else about it,&rdquo; added Georgina, &ldquo;only
&lsquo;prepare his family for the surprise.&rsquo;
So Barby went straight down there to Fishburn Court
and she&rsquo;s telling Aunt Elspeth and Uncle Darcy
now, so they&rsquo;ll have time to get used to the
news before he walks in on them.&rdquo;

They sat down on the top step with the dog between
them.

&ldquo;They must know it by this time,&rdquo; remarked
Georgina. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you wish you could
see what&rsquo;s happening, and how glad everybody
is? Uncle Darcy will want to start right out with
his bell and ring it till it cracks, telling the whole
town.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Richard.
&ldquo;He promised he wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Anyhow till Belle says he can,&rdquo; amended
Georgina. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll say so
when &lsquo;the call&rsquo; comes, but nobody knows
when that will be. It may be soon and it may not be
for years.&rdquo;

They sat there on the steps a long time, talking quietly,
but with the holiday feeling that one has when waiting
for a procession to pass by. The very air seemed full
of that sense of expectancy, of waiting for something
to happen.

Chapter XXXI
Comings and Goings

Out towards the cranberry bogs went the Towncrier.
No halting step this time, no weary droop of shoulders.
It would have taken a swift-footed boy to keep pace
with him on this errand. He was carrying the news to
Belle. What he expected her to say he did not stop
to ask himself, nor did he notice in the tumultuous
joy which kept his old heart pounding at unwonted
speed, that she turned white with the suddenness of
his telling, and then a wave of color surged over
her face. Her only answer was to lead him into the
room where the old net-mender lay helpless, turning
appealing eyes to her as she entered, with the look
in them that one sees in the eyes of a grateful dumb
animal. His gaze did not reach as far as the Towncrier,
who halted on the threshold until Belle joined him
there. She led him outside.

&ldquo;You see for yourself how it is,&rdquo; was
all she said. &ldquo;Do as you think best about it.&rdquo;

Out on the road again the Towncrier stood hesitating,
uncertain which course to take. Twice he started in
the direction of home, then retraced his steps again
to stand considering. Finally he straightened up with
a determined air and started briskly down the road
which led to the center of the town. Straight to the
bank he went, asking for Mr. Gates, and a moment later
was admitted into the president&rsquo;s private office.

&ldquo;And what can I do for you, Uncle Dan&rsquo;l?&rdquo;
was the cordial greeting.

The old man dropped heavily into the chair set out
for him. He was out of breath from his rapid going.

&ldquo;You can do me one of the biggest favors I ever
asked of anybody if you only will. Do you remember
a sealed envelope I brought in here the first of the
summer and asked you to keep for me till I called for
it?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes, do you want it now?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to show you what&rsquo;s in
it.&rdquo;

He had such an air of suppressed excitement as he
said it and his breathing was so labored, that Mr.
Gates wondered what could have happened to affect
him so. When he came back from the vault he carried
the envelope which had been left in his charge earlier
in the summer. Uncle Darcy tore it open with fingers
that trembled in their eagerness.

&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m about to show you is for your
eyes alone,&rdquo; he said. He took out a crumpled
sheet of paper which had once been torn in two and
pasted together again in clumsy fashion. It was the
paper which had been wadded up in the rifle, which
Belle had seized with hysterical fury, torn in two
and flung from her.

&ldquo;There! Read that!&rdquo; he commanded.

Mr. Gates knew everybody in town. He had been one
of the leading citizens who had subscribed to the
monument in Emmett Potter&rsquo;s honor. He could
scarcely believe the evidence of his own eyes as he
read the confession thrust into his hands, and he
had never been more surprised at any tale ever told
him than the one Uncle Darcy related now of the way
it had been found, and his promise to Belle Triplett.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to make it public while
old Potter hangs on,&rdquo; he said in conclusion.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait till he&rsquo;s past feeling
the hurts of earth. But Mr. Gates, I&rsquo;ve had
word that my Danny&rsquo;s coming home. I can&rsquo;t
let the boy come back to dark looks and cold shoulders
turned on him everywhere. I thought if you&rsquo;d
just start the word around that he&rsquo;s all right--that
somebody else confessed to what he&rsquo;s accused
of--that you&rsquo;d seen the proof with your own
eyes and could vouch for his being all right--if _you&rsquo;d_
just give him a welcoming hand and show you believed
in him it would make all the difference in the world
in Danny&rsquo;s home-coming. You needn&rsquo;t mention
any names,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;ll
make a lot of talk and surmising, but that won&rsquo;t
hurt anybody. If you could just do that----&rdquo;

When the old man walked out of the president&rsquo;s
office he carried his head as high as if he had been
given a kingdom. He had been given what was worth
more to him, the hearty handclasp of a man whose &ldquo;word
was as good as a bond,&rdquo; and the promise that
Dan should be welcomed back to the town by great and
small, as far as was in his power to make that welcome
cordial and widespread.



Dan did not wait in Washington while Doctor Huntingdon
made his report. He came on alone, and having missed
the boat, took the railroad journey down the Cape.
In the early September twilight he stepped off the
car, feeling as if he were in a strange dream. But
when he turned into one of the back streets leading
to his home, it was all so familiar and unchanged
that he had the stranger feeling of never having been
away. It was the past ten years that seemed a dream.

He had not realized how he loved the old town or the
depth of his longing for it, until he saw it now,
restored to him. Even the familiar, savory smells
floating out from various supper tables as he passed
along, gave him keen enjoyment. Some of them had been
unknown all the time of his wanderings in foreign
lands. The voices, the type of features, the dress
of the people he passed, the veriest trifles which
he never noticed when he lived among them, thrilled
him now with a sense of having come back to his own.

Half a dozen fishermen passed him, their boots clumping
heavily. He recognized two of them if not as individuals,
as members of families he had known, from their resemblance
to the older ones. Then he turned his head aside as
he reached the last man. He was not ready to be recognized
himself, yet. He wanted to go home first, and this
man at the end was Peter Winn. He had sailed in his
boat many a time.

A cold fog was settling over the Court when he turned
into it. As silently as the fog itself he stole through
the sand and in at the gate. The front door was shut
and the yellow blind pulled down over the window,
but the lamp behind it sent out a glow, reaching dimly
through the fog. He crept up close to it to listen
for the sound of voices, and suddenly two blended
shadows were thrown on the blind. The old man was helping
his wife up from her rocking chair and supporting
her with a careful arm as he guided her across to
the table. His voice rang out cheerfully to the waiting
listener.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Mother! That&rsquo;s it! Just
one more step now. Why, you&rsquo;re doing fine! I
knew the word of Danny&rsquo;s coming home would put
you on your feet again. The lad&rsquo;ll be here soon,
thank God! Maybe before another nightfall.&rdquo;

A moment later and the lamp-light threw another shadow
on the yellow blind, plain as a photograph. It was
well that the fog drew a white veil between it and
the street, for it was a picture of joy too sacred
for curious eyes to see.

_Danny had come home!_



It was the tenth of September. The town looked strangely
deserted with nearly all the summer people gone. The
railroad wharf was the only place where there was
the usual bustle and crowd, and that was because the
_Dorothy Bradford_ was gathering up its passengers
for the last trip of the season.

Richard was to be one of them, and a most unwilling
one. Not that he was sorry to be going back to school.
He had missed Binney and the gang, and could hardly
wait to begin swapping experiences with them. But he
was leaving Captain Kidd behind. Dogs were not allowed
in the apartment house to which his father and Aunt
Letty intended moving the next week.

There had been a sorry morning in the garage when
the news was broken to him. He crept up into the machine
and lay down on the back seat, and cried and cried
with his arms around Captain Kidd&rsquo;s neck. The
faithful little tongue reached out now and then to
lap away his master&rsquo;s tears, and once he lifted
his paw and clawed at the little striped shirt waist
as if trying to convey some mute comfort.

&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the same as folks!&rdquo;
sobbed Richard, hugging the shaggy head, laid lovingly
on his breast. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s _cruel_
of &rsquo;em to make me give you away.&rdquo; Several
days had passed since that unhappy morning, however,
and Richard did not feel quite so desolate over the
separation now. For one thing it had not been necessary
to give up all claim on Captain Kidd to insure him
a good home. Georgina had gladly accepted the offer
of half of him, and had coaxed even Tippy into according
him a reluctant welcome.

The passengers already on deck watched with interest
the group near the gang-plank. Richard was putting
the clever little terrier through his whole list of
tricks.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last time, old fellow,&rdquo;
he said implor-ingly when the dog hesitated over one
of them. &ldquo;Go on and do it for me this once. Maybe
I&rsquo;ll never see you again till I&rsquo;m grown
up and you&rsquo;re too old to remember me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you said about Dan&rsquo;s
coming home,&rdquo; remarked Georgina from under the
shade of her pink parasol. That parasol and the pink
dress and the rose-like glow on the happy little face
was attracting even more admiration from the passengers
than Captain Kidd&rsquo;s tricks. Barbara, standing
beside her, cool and dainty in a white dress and pale
green sweater and green parasol, made almost as much
of a picture.

&ldquo;You talked that way about never expecting to
see Danny till you were grown,&rdquo; continued Georgina,
&ldquo;and it turned out that you not only saw him,
but were with him long enough to hear some of his adventures.
It would be the same way about your coming back here
if you&rsquo;d just keep hoping hard enough.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Come Dicky,&rdquo; called Mr. Moreland from
the upper deck. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re about to take
in the gang-plank. Don&rsquo;t get left.&rdquo;

Maybe it was just as well that there was no time for
good-byes. Maybe it was more than the little fellow
could have managed manfully. As it was his voice sounded
suspiciously near breaking as he called back over his
shoulder, almost gruffly:

&ldquo;Well you--you be as good to my half of him
as you are to yours.&rdquo;

A moment or two later, leaning over the railing of
the upper deck he could see Captain Kidd struggling
and whining to follow him. But Barby held tightly
to the chain fastened to his collar, and Georgina,
her precious pink parasol cast aside, knelt on the
wharf beside the quivering, eager little body to clasp
her arms about it and pour out a flood of comforting
endearments.

Wider and wider grew the stretch of water between
the boat and the wharf. Richard kept on waving until
he could no longer distinguish the little group on
the end of the pier. But he knew they would be there
until the last curl of smoke from the steamer disappeared
around Long Point.

&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the friendly voice of a woman
stand ing next to him. She had been one of the interested
witnesses of the parting. She thrust an opera-glass
into his hands. For one more long satisfying moment
he had another glimpse of the little group, still
faithfully waving, still watching. How very, very
far away they were!

Suddenly the glass grew so blurry and queer it was
no more good, and he handed it back to the woman.
At that moment he would have given all the pirate
gold that was ever on land or sea, were it his to give,
to be back on that pier with the three of them, able
to claim that old seaport town as his home for ever
and always. And then the one thing that it had taught
him came to his help. With his head up, he looked back
to the distant shore where the Pilgrim monument reared
itself like a watchful giant, and said hopefully,
under his breath: &ldquo;Well, _some day!_&rdquo;



Georgina, waking earlier than usual that September
morning, looked up and read the verse on the calendar
opposite her bed, which she had jead every, morning
since the month came in.

&ldquo;Like ships my days sail swift to port,
I know not if this be
The one to bear a cargo rare
Of happiness to me.

&ldquo;But I _do_ know this time,&rdquo;
she thought exultingly, sitting up in bed to look
out the window and see what kind of weather the dawn
had brought. This was the day her father was coming
home. He was coming from Boston on a battleship, and
she and Barby were going out to meet him as soon as
it was sighted in the harbor.

She had that quivery, excited feeling which sometimes
seizes travelers as they near the journey&rsquo;s
end, as if she herself were a little ship, putting
into a long-wished-for port. Well, it would be like
that in a way, she thought, to have her father&rsquo;s
arms folded around her, to come at last into the strange,
sweet intimacy she had longed for ever since she first
saw Peggy Burrell and the Captain.

And it was reaching another long-desired port to have
Barby&rsquo;s happiness so complete. As for Uncle
Darcy he said himself that he couldn&rsquo;t be gladder
walking the shining streets of heaven, than he was
going along that old board-walk with Danny beside
him, and everybody so friendly and so pleased to see
him.

Georgina still called him Danny in her thoughts, but
it had been somewhat a shock the first time she saw
him, to find that he was a grown man with a grave,
mature face, instead of the boy which Uncle Darcy&rsquo;s
way of speaking of him had led her to expect. He had
already been up to the house to tell them the many
things they were eager to know about the months he
had spent with Doctor Huntingdon and their long trip
home together. And listening, Georgina realized how
very deep was the respect and admiration of this younger
man for her father, and his work, and, everything
he said made her more eager to see and know him.

Uncle Darcy and Dan were with them when they put out
in the motor boat to meet the battleship. It was almost
sunset when they started, and the man at the wheel
drove so fast they felt the keen whip of the wind as
they cut through the waves. They were glad to button
their coats, even up to their chins. Uncle Darcy and
Dan talked all the way over, but Georgina sat with
her hand tightly locked in her mother&rsquo;s, sharing
her tense expectancy, never saying a word.

Then at last the little boat stopped alongside the
big one. There were a few moments of delay before
Georgina looked up and saw her father coming down
to them. He was just as his photograph had pictured
him, tall, erect, commanding, and strangely enough
her first view of him was with his face turned to
one side. Then it was hidden from her as he gathered
Barby into his arms and held her close.

Georgina, watching that meeting with wistful, anxious
eyes, felt her last little doubt of him vanish, and
when he turned to her with his stern lips curved into
the smile she had hoped for, and with out-stretched
arms, she sprang into them and threw her arms around
his neck with such a welcoming clasp that his eyes
filled with tears.

Then, remembering certain little letters which he
had re-read many times on his homeward voyage, he
held her off to look into her eyes and whisper with
a tender smile which made the teasing question a joy
to her:

&ldquo;Which is it now? &lsquo;Dear Sir&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Dad-o&rsquo;-my heart?&rsquo;&rdquo;

The impetuous pressure of her soft little cheek against
his face was answer eloquent enough. As they neared
the shore a bell tolled out over the water. It was
the bell of Saint Peter, patron saint of the fisher-folk
and all those who dwell by the sea. Then Long Point
lighthouse flashed a wel-come, and the red lamp of
Wood End blinked in answer. On the other side Highland
Light sent its great, unfailing glare out over the
Atlantic, and the old Towncrier, looking up, saw the
first stars shining overhead.

Alongshore the home lights began to burn. One shone
out in Fishburn Court where Aunt Elspeth sat waiting.
One threw its gleam over the edge of the cranberry
bog from the window where Belle kept faithful vigil--where
she would continue to keep it until &ldquo;the call&rdquo;
came to release the watcher as well as the stricken
old soul whose peace she guarded. And up in the big
gray house by the break-water, where Tippy was keeping
supper hot, a supper fit to set before a king, lights
blazed from every window.

Pondering on what all these lights stood for, the
old man moved away from the others, and took his place
near the prow. His heart was too full just now to
talk as they were doing. Presently he felt a touch
on his arm. Georgina had laid her hand on it with
the understanding touch of perfect comradeship. They
were his own words she was repeating to him, but they
bore the added weight of her own experience now.

&ldquo;It _pays_ to keep Hope at the prow,
Uncle Darcy.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Aye, lass,&rdquo; he answered tremulously,
&ldquo;it does.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re coming into port with all flags
flying!&rdquo;

&ldquo;_That_ we are!&rdquo;

She stood in silent gladness after that, the rest
of the way, her curls flying back in the wind made
by the swift motion of the boat, the white spray dashing
up till she could taste the salt of it on her lips;
a little figure of Hope herself, but of Hope riding
triumphantly into the port of its fulfillment. It
was for them all--those words of the old psalm on
which the rainbow had rested, and which the angel voice
had sung--&ldquo;_Into their desired haven_.&rdquo;

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
