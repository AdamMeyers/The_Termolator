PREFACE


The object of this little book is clearly expressed
on the title-page; and the title-page
might be left to speak for itself, were it not for
the inevitable criticism that Boswell needs no
introduction. "The most discreet of cicerones"
it has been said "is an intruder when we open our
old favourite, and, without further magic, retire
into that delicious nook of eighteenth-century
society[1]."

This is from the point of view of the literary
man, the "true lover" of Boswell; but the Life
is a long and, outwardly, formidable work with
which many, who might have been true lovers,
have, through lack of an introduction, hardly attained
even to a casual acquaintance.

The usefulness, then, of such a book as this
can be tested by one question: Is a man more,
or less, likely to read Boswell and to read him
with enjoyment, because, as a boy, he has been
told the story of Dr Johnson in simpler form?

This "simpler form" may require a little explanation.

I have not been so foolish or so sacrilegious as
to attempt to paraphrase Boswell for the young;
on the other hand, I have not merely strung together
a series of extracts and offered them as the
[Pg viii]
gems of the Boswellian narrative. But, letting
Boswell for the most part speak for himself       not
in isolated tit-bits, but in substantial paragraphs       I
have endeavoured to present Dr Johnson, in
the various stages of his career and in the varied
circle of his friends, in such a way as to attract
those who have not already known the charm of
the "delicious nook" referred to above.

In one or two of the chapters I have turned to
the records of other friends besides Boswell       notably
Mrs Thrale and Fanny Burney.

For the many imperfections that critics will
discover I must plead certain limitations: my
range of authorities was limited by remoteness
from a large library; my space by the modest
design of the book; my time by the imminence
of an army medical board.

Much, indeed, is omitted, but if I shall win
new readers for Boswell, I shall dare to say, like
Johnson, that something likewise is performed.

NOTE ON THE SECOND EDITION

I have taken the opportunity of correcting
several mistakes pointed out by friendly critics.

In response to the suggestion of the reviewer
in The Times Literary Supplement I have also added
brief notes on the Birthplace and on the Gough
Square house; of the latter a new photograph
has been made.

The Story of Doctor JOHNSON




Johnson's World



  

On the title-page of The Life of Samuel
Johnson, LL.D., by James Boswell,
Esq., the work to which this little
book is a stepping-stone, Boswell
claims that the story of Dr Johnson's
life exhibits "a view of literature and literary
men in Great-Britain, for near half a century,
during which he flourished."

It is no idle claim. Indeed, Boswell might have
gone a great deal further, for his story is not merely
concerned with books and bookish men, but with
men and women in every rank of society.

Kings and cottagers, statesmen and shopkeepers,
bishops and play-actors, rich brewers and penniless
poets, dukes and innkeepers, country parsons
and gay young men of the town, street beggars
and fashionable ladies       all play their part in the
story and shew us a picture of the English world
in the eighteenth century such as no history-book
can give.
[Pg 2]
Dr Johnson lived in four reigns       from 1709 to
1784. He could remember seeing Queen Anne
and had an audience of George III; a Jacobite as
a boy and a Tory always, he saw the '15 and the
'45; he groaned under the Whig domination of
Walpole and rejoiced in the Tory triumph of the
king who gloried in the name of Briton; he saw
the victories of our armies in India and Canada
and their failure in America; he saw the damage
done in the Gordon Riots and chatted to a South
Sea islander brought home by Captain Cook; he
dined with John Wilkes and was a guest in the
house of Flora Macdonald.

In a tavern, a club, a drawing-room, or a post-chaise
he would argue, and have the best of the
argument, on the institution of slavery or the choice
of books for babies; on the government of India
or the poetry of Gray; on the doctrine of free
will or the points of a bull-dog; on the management
of a university press or the writing of a good
cookery book.

In 1737 he came to London with twopence-halfpenny
and a half-written tragedy in his pocket
and for nearly twenty years did the work of an
unknown literary drudge; for the last thirty years
of his life he was the dominant figure in the educated
society of London, laying down the law on
politics to Edmund Burke, on literature to Oliver
Goldsmith, on painting to Sir Joshua Reynolds,
on history to Edward Gibbon, on acting to David
Garrick, and on everything to James Boswell.

Let us see what Boswell has to tell us.


[Pg 3]



School Days


Johnson was not born into the world at which
we have just glanced. Indeed, had his character
been less remarkable, he might have lived and
died a schoolmaster, or a bookseller, in a country
town. For his father, Michael Johnson, kept a
bookshop in Lichfield, Staffordshire, and here his
son Samuel was born in 1709.

Of old Mr Johnson Boswell says that "he was
a pretty good Latin scholar, and a citizen so
creditable as to be made one of the magistrates
of Lichfield.... He was a zealous high-church man
and royalist and retained his attachment to the
unfortunate house of Stuart."

Now, according to a modern poet:


Every boy and every gal
That's born into the world alive
Is either a little Liberal
Or else a little Conservative.


In those days men talked of Whig and Tory as
we talk of Liberal and Conservative, and if ever
a man was born a Tory, that man was Samuel
Johnson.

To be a Tory in 1710 meant, generally speaking,
to disapprove of the Revolution of 1688,
when James II was driven from his throne and
William III summoned to rule in his place; and
great excitement had been caused in the country
[Pg 4]
by a sermon preached at St Paul's against the
principles of the Revolution by a certain Dr
Sacheverell.

A visit of this preacher to Lichfield gave young
Samuel Johnson the opportunity to shew himself
what Boswell calls "the infant Hercules of
Toryism." Here is the story told by a Lichfield
lady:

"When Dr Sacheverel was at Lichfield, Johnson
was not quite three years old. My grandfather
Hammond observed him at the cathedral perched
upon his father's shoulders, listening and gaping
at the much celebrated preacher. Mr Hammond
asked Mr Johnson how he could possibly think of
bringing such an infant to church and in the midst
of so great a croud. He answered, because it was
impossible to keep him at home; for, young as he
was, he believed he had caught the publick spirit
and zeal for Sacheverel, and would have staid for
ever in the church, satisfied with beholding him."

Nowadays it is difficult for us to imagine a three-year-old
baby insisting on hearing a sermon,
say, by the Dean of St Paul's or even a speech
by the Prime Minister. But Johnson, as we shall
see, was no ordinary child; and to the end of his
life he was no ordinary hater of the Whigs.

Living, as he did, in the atmosphere of a bookshop,
it was natural that the boy should be more
inclined than others towards learning. His memory
was wonderful:

"When he was a child in petticoats and had
learnt to read, Mrs Johnson one morning put
the common prayer-book into his hands, pointed
[Pg 5]
to the collect for the day, and said 'Sam, you must
get this by heart.' She went up stairs, leaving him
to study it: But by the time she had reached the
second floor, she heard him following her. 'What's
the matter?' said she. 'I can say it,' he replied;
and repeated it distinctly, though he could not
have read it more than twice."


  
  Johnson's birthplace at Lichfield
  

The birthplace, having been presented to the city of Lichfield
by the late Lieut.-Col. John Gilbert, was opened to the public
as a Johnson Museum and Library in 1901. In it are preserved
various books, manuscripts, portraits and other relics. A full
account of Johnson's association with Lichfield is given in
Dr Samuel Johnson and His Birthplace: A Retrospect and Guide.
Compiled by the Johnson House Committee (Lichfield, 1915).]

He was first taught to read English by one
Dame Oliver and "from his earliest years he loved
to read poetry, but hardly ever read any poem
to the end; ... he read Shakspeare at a period so
early, that the speech of the Ghost in Hamlet
terrified him when he was alone." At the age of
10 he began to learn Latin with an under master
at Lichfield School, of which the headmaster, Mr
Hunter, must have put terror into the hearts of
his pupils.

"He used" so Johnson afterwards told Boswell
"to beat us unmercifully; and he did not distinguish
between ignorance and negligence; for he
would beat a boy equally for not knowing a thing,
as for neglecting to know it. He would ask a boy
a question; and if he did not answer it, he would
beat him, without considering whether he had an
opportunity of knowing how to answer it. For instance,
he would call up a boy and ask him Latin
for a candlestick, which the boy could not expect
to be asked. Now, Sir, if a boy could answer every
question, there would be no need of a master to
teach him."

"However ..." says Boswell "Johnson was very
sensible how much he owed to Mr Hunter. Mr
Langton one day asked him how he had acquired
[Pg 6]
so accurate a knowledge of Latin, in which, I believe,
he was exceeded by no man of his time; he
said 'My master whipt me very well. Without
that, Sir, I should have done nothing.... A child
is afraid of being whipped and gets his task, and
there's an end on't.'"

Boswell also gives us a picture of Johnson at
school as drawn by a schoolfellow       Mr Hector:

"He seemed to learn by intuition ... whenever
he made an exertion he did more than any one
else.... He was uncommonly inquisitive; and his
memory was so tenacious, that he never forgot anything
that he either heard or read."

In the holidays Hector "could not oblige him
more than by sauntering away the hours of vacation
in the fields, during which he was more engaged
in talking to himself than to his companion."

This sounds more like a gloomy young prig
than a healthy 12-year-old boy. But Johnson was
far from healthy and his superior brains were useful
to others besides himself:

"His favourites used to receive very liberal
assistance from him; and such was the submission
and deference with which he was treated, such
the desire to obtain his regard, that three of the
boys, of whom Mr Hector was sometimes one,
used to come in the morning as his humble attendants
and carry him to school."

After a year at another school at Stourbridge,
he returned home:

"The two years which he spent at home, after
his return from Stourbridge, he passed in what he
thought idleness, and was scolded by his father for
[Pg 7]
his want of steady application. He had no settled
plan of life, nor looked forward at all, but merely
lived from day to day. Yet he read a great deal in
a desultory manner, without any scheme of study,
as chance threw books in his way, and inclination
directed him through them. He used to mention
one curious instance of his casual reading, when
but a boy. Having imagined that his brother had
hid some apples behind a large folio upon an upper
shelf in his father's shop, he climbed up to search
for them. There were no apples; but the large
folio proved to be Petrarch, whom he had seen
mentioned in some preface, as one of the restorers
of learning. His curiosity having been thus excited,
he sat down with avidity, and read a great
part of the book. What he read during these two
years he told me, was not works of mere amusement,
'not voyages and travels, but all literature,
Sir, all ancient writers, all manly.'"

Johnson's father at this time used to set up a
bookstall on market-days at neighbouring towns.
One day he asked his son to go with him to
Uttoxeter. Samuel refused, being too proud to
stand at the stall in the market-place.

Again we feel inclined to think our hero rather
a prig of a fellow       too lazy to do regular work
of his own, too proud to help his father. Why
couldn't he do a day's work and then spend his
leisure in the open air, fishing or playing games?

Here we must go back a little and look at the
sadder side of Johnson's boyhood. He was never
healthy. From his father he inherited a "vile melancholy"
and he "had the misfortune to be much
[Pg 8]
afflicted with the scrophula, or king's evil, which
disfigured a countenance naturally well formed,
and hurt his visual nerves so much, that he did
not see at all with one of his eyes, though its
appearance was little different from that of the
other."

At that time it was still believed that this disease
could be cured by a touch of the reigning king or
queen. So Mrs Johnson "carried him to London,
where he was actually touched by Queen Anne...."
Being asked if he could remember Queen Anne,
"He had," he said, "a confused, but somehow a
sort of solemn recollection of a lady in diamonds,
and a long black hood."

But it did Johnson no good. Neither then, nor
in later life, was he freed of the burden of ill-health
and we can now better understand why "he never
joined with the other boys in their ordinary diversions:
his only amusement was in winter, when he
took a pleasure in being drawn upon the ice by a
boy barefooted, who pulled him along by a garter
fixed round him; no very easy operation as his
size was remarkably large. His defective sight,
indeed, prevented him from enjoying the common
sports."

Three habits, at least, Dr Johnson learned in
boyhood which he continued to practise as a man       to
hate the Whigs, to love books, and to endure
pain.


[Pg 9]



Oxford and after


Two hundred years ago it was not easy for
a poor country bookseller to send his son to
Oxford; and it is probable that it was only with
the help of friends that old Mr Johnson was able
to pay his son's expenses at the university.

However that may be, the name of Samuel
Johnson was entered in the books of Pembroke
College, Oxford, in 1728.

He had at least one parting gift, for good Dame
Oliver, his first teacher, hearing that he was about
to go, "came to take leave of him [and] brought
him, in the simplicity of her kindness, a present of
gingerbread, and said, he was the best scholar she
ever had." Boswell further tells us that Johnson
"delighted in mentioning this early compliment:
adding, with a smile, that 'this was as high a proof
of his merit as he could conceive.'"

Besides his gingerbread, however, Johnson took
with him a good knowledge of books. "I had
looked" he said "into a great many books, which
were not commonly known at the Universities,
where they seldom read any books but what are
put into their hands by their tutors; so that when
I came to Oxford, Dr Adams told me I was the
best qualified for the University that he had ever
known come there."

And indeed he quickly showed himself to be
more learned than the ordinary "freshman."

[Pg 10]

Nowadays, when a father takes his son for a first
interview with a college tutor, it is not usual for
the boy to break into the conversation with a quotation
from one of the less-known Latin authors.

This is Boswell's story of Johnson's arrival at
Oxford:

"His father, who had anxiously accompanied
him, found means to have him introduced to
Mr Jorden, who was to be his tutor.... His father
seemed very full of the merits of his son, and told
the company he was a good scholar, and a poet,
and wrote Latin verses. His figure and manner
appeared strange to them; but he behaved modestly,
and sat silent, till upon something which occurred
in the course of conversation, he suddenly
struck in and quoted Macrobius; and thus he
gave the first impression of that more extensive
reading in which he had indulged himself."

Johnson had no great opinion of Mr Jorden as
a scholar:

"He was a very worthy man, but a heavy man,
and I did not profit much by his instructions. Indeed,
I did not attend him much. The first day
after I came to college I waited upon him, and
then stayed away four. On the sixth, Mr Jorden
asked me why I had not attended. I answered I
had been sliding in Christ Church meadow. And
this I said with as much nonchalance as I am now
talking to you. I had no notion I was wrong or
irreverent to my tutor."

Johnson's rooms were on the second floor over
the gateway of Pembroke College. The tower
itself has been much altered, but the visitor to
[Pg 11]
Oxford can see the rooms pretty much as they
were in Johnson's day. Elsewhere in the college
he may examine (or "contemplate with veneration,"
as Boswell would have done) many Johnsonian
relics       his writing-desk and tea-pot among
them.

From what we already know of Johnson's boyhood,
we cannot picture him as a lively undergraduate;
for poverty and ill-health make it
difficult for a young man to enjoy life with his
fellows, and Johnson suffered from both.

A schoolfellow of Johnson, named Taylor,
had come up to Christ Church, where one of the
tutors, Mr Bateman, had a high reputation:

"Mr Bateman's lectures were so excellent,
that Johnson used to come and get them at
second-hand from Taylor, till his poverty being
so extreme that his shoes were worn out, and
his feet appeared through them, he saw that this
humiliating circumstance was perceived by the
Christ Church men, and he came no more. He
was too proud to accept of money, and somebody
having set a pair of new shoes at his door, he
threw them away with indignation."

"How must we feel" adds the faithful Boswell
"when we read such an anecdote of Samuel
Johnson!"

Nor had his health improved. Here is an account
of him at the end of his first year at Oxford:

"While he was at Lichfield, in the college
vacation of the year 1729, he felt himself overwhelmed
with ... perpetual irritation, fretfulness
and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and
[Pg 12]
despair, which made existence misery. From this
dismal malady he never afterwards was perfectly
relieved ... he was sometimes so languid and inefficient,
that he could not distinguish the hour
upon the town-clock."

We are rather surprised, then, to read that he
was at Oxford "caressed and loved by all about
him, was a gay and frolicksome fellow, and passed
there the happiest part of his life."

"This" says Boswell "is a striking proof of
the fallacy of appearances, and how little any of
us know of the real internal state even of those
whom we see most frequently; for the truth is,
that he was then depressed by poverty, and irritated
by disease. When I mentioned to him this
account as given me by Dr Adams, he said 'Ah,
Sir, I was mad and violent. It was bitterness which
they mistook for frolick. I was miserably poor,
and I thought to fight my way by my literature
and my wit; so I disregarded all power and all
authority.'"

Johnson was too poor to complete his course
of study and left Oxford in 1731 without the
degree of Bachelor of Arts. But though he had no
degree, he had gained much from the University.
He had widened his knowledge of books, reading
mostly Greek and Latin authors.

"He had" says Boswell "a peculiar facility in
seizing at once what was valuable in any book,
without submitting to the labour of perusing it
from beginning to end."

He learnt, too, to love his college and the university.
Later we shall see how affectionately he
[Pg 13]
talked of the days when "he was generally seen
lounging at the College gate, with a circle of
young students round him, whom he was entertaining
with wit, and keeping from their studies."

"O! Mr Edwards!" he exclaimed to an old
friend about 50 years later "I'll convince you that
I recollect you. Do you remember our drinking
together at an alehouse near Pembroke gate?"       but
we must go back and see him as he came
down from Oxford at the age of 22:

"And now (I had almost said poor) Samuel
Johnson returned to his native city, destitute, and
not knowing how he should gain even a decent
livelihood. His father's misfortune in trade rendered
him unable to support his son; and for
some time there appeared no means by which he
could maintain himself. In the December of this
year his father died."

"I layed by" wrote Johnson in his diary (15 July
1732) "eleven guineas on this day, when I received
twenty pounds, being all that I have reason
to hope for out of my father's effects, previous to
the death of my mother; an event which I pray
God may be very remote. I now therefore see
that I must make my own fortune."

How was this fortune to be made?

Like many another after him who has left the
university with no definite plan of life in view,
Johnson turned inevitably to teaching, accepting
"an offer to be employed as usher in the school of
Market-Bosworth, in Leicestershire, to which it
appears, from one of his little fragments of a diary,
that he went on foot."

[Pg 14]

Like many another, too, he soon complained
that "this employment was very irksome to him
in every respect ... that it was unvaried as the
note of the cuckow; and that he did not know
whether it was more disagreeable for him to teach,
or the boys to learn, the grammar rules."

A few months of this were enough for him, after
which he went to live with his friend Mr Hector
at Birmingham and began to earn a little money
by his pen. For the translation of a French book
of travel he received five guineas.

In Birmingham Johnson fell in love with a
widow       Mrs Porter. This lady was twenty
years older than her lover and, as we shall see
in a moment, no great beauty.

Nor was Johnson. When he was first introduced
to her, "his appearance was very forbidding; he
was then lean and lank, so that his immense structure
of bones was hideously striking to the eye,
and the scars of the scrophula were deeply visible.
He also wore his hair, which was straight and stiff,
and separated behind: and he often had, seemingly,
convulsive starts and odd gesticulations,
which tended to excite at once surprize and ridicule.
Mrs Porter was so much engaged by his conversation
that she overlooked all these external
disadvantages and said to her daughter, 'this is
the most sensible man that I ever saw in my life.'"

"I know not" Boswell goes on "for what reason
the marriage ceremony was not performed at
Birmingham; but a resolution was taken that it
should be at Derby, for which place the bride and
bridegroom set out on horseback, I suppose in
[Pg 15]
very good humour ... I have had from my illustrious
friend the following curious account of
their journey to church upon the nuptial morn:
'Sir, she had read the old romances, and had got
into her head the fantastical notion that a woman
of spirit should use her lover like a dog. So, Sir,
at first she told me that I rode too fast, and she
could not keep up with me; and, when I rode a
little slower, she passed me, and complained that
I lagged behind. I was not to be made the slave
of caprice; and I resolved to begin as I meant
to end. I therefore pushed on briskly, till I was
fairly out of her sight. The road lay between two
hedges, so I was sure she could not miss it; and
I contrived that she should soon come up with me.
When she did, I observed her to be in tears.'"

This is what Boswell, who was a married man,
calls "a manly firmness," though he admits that
it was "a singular beginning."

"Sir," said Johnson to a friend years afterwards
"it was a love marriage on both sides."

"In the Gentleman's Magazine for 1736," says
Boswell, "there is the following advertisement:



'At Edial, near Lichfield, in Staffordshire, young
gentlemen are boarded and taught the Latin and Greek
languages, by Samuel Johnson.'

But the only pupils that were put under his
care were the celebrated David Garrick and his
brother George, and a Mr Offely, a young gentleman
of good fortune who died early."

Boswell (though he has a kind word of patronage
for successful schoolmasters) evidently thought
[Pg 16]
that his hero's brains were too good, and his temper
too bad, for the profession of teaching; moreover,
David Garrick was the kind of boy who is
the despair of his teacher, the delight of his schoolfellows,
and the hero of school stories.

The truth about Johnson as a schoolmaster,
according to Boswell, was that "he was not so well
qualified for being a teacher of elements ... as men
of inferiour powers of mind.... The art of communicating
instruction, of whatever kind, is much to
be valued; and I have ever thought that those
who devote themselves to this employment, and
do their duty with diligence and success, are entitled
to very high respect from the community,
as Johnson himself often maintained. Yet I am
of opinion that the greatest abilities are not only
not required for this office, but render a man less
fit for it. While we acknowledge the justness of
Thomson's beautiful remark,


'Delightful task! to rear the tender thought,
And teach the young idea how to shoot!'


we must consider that this delight is perceptible
only by 'a mind at ease,' a mind at once calm
and clear; but that a mind gloomy and impetuous
like that of Johnson, cannot be fixed for any length
of time in minute attention, and must be so
frequently irritated by unavoidable slowness and
errour in the advances of scholars, as to perform
the duty, with little pleasure to the teacher, and
no great advantage to the pupils. Good temper
is a most essential requisite in a Preceptor....
From Mr Garrick's account he did not appear
to have been profoundly reverenced by his pupils.
[Pg 17]
His oddities of manner, and uncouth gesticulations,
could not but be the subject of merriment ...
and, in particular, the young rogues used to ...
turn into ridicule his tumultuous and awkward
fondness for Mrs Johnson, whom he used to name
... Tetty or Tetsey ... which seems to us ludicrous,
when applied to a woman of her age and appearance.
Mr Garrick described her to me as very fat,
with a bosom of more than ordinary protuberance,
with swelled cheeks of a florid red, produced by
thick painting, and increased by the liberal use of
cordials; flaring and fantastick in her dress, and
affected both in her speech and her general behaviour.
I have seen Garrick exhibit her, by his
exquisite talent of mimickry, so as to excite the
heartiest bursts of laughter."

The "exquisite talent of mimickry" is not
popular amongst schoolmasters and the academy
for young gentlemen was closed after a year and
a half.

Again, what was Johnson to do? He had tried
teaching and failed; he had written a little, but
could not hope to get money or fame by selling
translations to country booksellers; he had married
a wife. The next step was the decisive one:

"Johnson now thought of trying his fortune
in London."


[Pg 18]




Johnson comes to London


"I came to London" said Johnson in later
years "with two-pence half-penny in my
pocket."

Garrick overhearing him, exclaimed, "eh?
what do you say? with two-pence half-penny in
your pocket?"

Johnson, "Why yes; when I came with two-pence
half-penny in my pocket, and thou, Davy,
with three half-pence in thine."

Master and pupil had travelled together; Garrick
was to 'complete his education' at an academy
kept by a Mr Colson, but it was well for Johnson
that he "knew how he could live in the cheapest
manner. His first lodgings were at the house of
Mr Norris, a staymaker, in Exeter-street, adjoining
Catherine-street, in the Strand. 'I dined (said
he) very well for eight-pence, with very good company,
at the Pine Apple in New-street, just by.
Several of them had travelled. They expected to
meet every day; but did not know one another's
names. It used to cost the rest a shilling, for they
drank wine; but I had a cut of meat for six-pence,
and bread for a penny, and gave the waiter a penny;
so that I was quite well served, nay, better than
the rest, for they gave the waiter nothing.'"

Johnson was, as Boswell says, "an adventurer in
[Pg 19]
literature." What kind of place was this London
of 1737, this "great field of genius and exertion,
where" according to Boswell "talents of every
kind have the fullest scope, and the highest encouragement"?

Here are two pictures. The first is an account
of an ordinary day's doings by a stranger staying
in Pall Mall:

"We rise by nine, and those that frequent great
men's levees find entertainment at them till eleven
or go to tea-tables. About twelve the beau monde
assembles in several coffee or chocolate houses ...
all so near to one another that in less than an hour
you see the company of them all. We are carried
to these places in chairs, which are here very cheap,
a guinea a week, or one shilling per hour, and your
chair-men serve you for porters to run on errands....
If it is fine weather we take a turn in the park till
two, when we go for dinner.... Ordinaries are not
so common here as abroad, but there are good
French ones in Suffolk Street. The general way
here is to make a party at the coffee-house to go
to dine at the tavern, where we sit till six, when
we go to the play, except you are invited to the
table of some great man. After the play the best
company generally go to Tom's and Will's
coffee-houses near adjoining, where there is playing
at picquet and the best of conversation till
midnight.... Or if you like rather the company of
ladies, there are assemblies at most people of
quality's houses."

The second is by an Irish painter whom Johnson
had met at Birmingham and who had "practised
[Pg 20]
his own precepts of        conomy for several years in
the British capital":

"He assured Johnson, who, I suppose, was then
meditating to try his fortune in London, but was
apprehensive of the expence, 'that thirty pounds a
year was enough to enable a man to live there without
being contemptible. He allowed ten pounds
for clothes and linen. He said a man might live
in a garret at eighteen-pence a week; few people
would enquire where he lodged; and, if they did,
it was easy to say 'Sir, I am to be found at such a
place.' By spending three-pence in a coffee-house,
he might be for some hours every day in very
good company; he might dine for sixpence, breakfast
on bread and milk for a penny, and do without
supper. On clean-shirt-day he went abroad,
and paid visits."

It was this world of "Grub Street" (a street
which became famous about the end of the 16th
century as the home of poor authors and whose
name was used generally to mean the world in
which they lived[2]) which Johnson had to face. He
must try and make a living by his pen.

He had, of course, no "patron," no rich man
who would help to pay for the printing of his
books, recommend them to his fashionable friends
and perhaps secure their author a government
post which would bring with it light duties and a
comfortable income.

Except for Harry Hervey ("a vicious man, but
very kind to me," he told Boswell, "If you call a
dog Hervey, I shall love him") Johnson hardly
[Pg 21]
had a friend in London. What was he to write?
Who was to buy his manuscripts?

Newspapers, indeed, were everywhere. They
consisted mostly of four pages containing a little
news, a little gossip, a little poetry, and many
advertisements. There was not much hope for
Johnson here.

A journal founded in 1731 gave him a better
opening.

"The Gentleman's Magazine, begun and carried
on by Mr Edward Cave, under the name of
Sylvanus Urban, had attracted the notice and
esteem of Johnson, in an eminent degree, before
he came to London.... He told me, that when he
first saw St John's Gate, the place where that
deservedly popular miscellany was originally
printed, he 'beheld it with reverence.'"

To Mr Cave, therefore, Johnson wrote, having
observed in his paper "very uncommon offers
of encouragement to men of letters," and The
Gentleman's Magazine was for many years "his
principal source for employment and support."

In the summer of 1737 he went back to Lichfield,
where he finished a tragedy called Irene, of
which we shall hear something later. On his return
to London he brought his wife with him,
and in London he lived for the remaining 47 years
of his life.

It was fitting, therefore, that the first of his
writings which brought him fame should be a
poem called London. It was offered to, and refused
by, several booksellers, an incident afterwards
commemorated in these lines:

[Pg 22]


Will no kind patron Johnson own?
Shall Johnson friendless range the town?
And every publisher refuse
The offspring of his happy Muse?


However, the "worthy, modest, and ingenious
Mr Robert Dodsley had taste enough to perceive
its uncommon merit, and thought it creditable to
have a share in it."

Now this poem may not attract us very much
to-day. Boswell, of course, thought it "one of the
noblest productions in our language," but to understand
it properly we need to know something of
the politics of the time, especially of the Tory
feeling against Sir Robert Walpole, the prime
minister who said that "every man had his price";
we need to know something, too, of the poem by
Juvenal, of which it is an imitation.

But a few lines are quoted here, because they
bring out very clearly the state of Johnson's mind
at the time.

He is a bitter opponent of the corrupt
government of the day and its weak concessions
to Spain:


Grant me, kind heaven, to find some happier place,
Where honesty and sense are no disgrace ...
Here let those reign, whom pensions can incite
To vote a patriot black, a courtier white;
Explain their country's dear-bought rights away,
And plead for pirates in the face of day.[3]



  
  Title-page of The Gentleman's Magazine, March, 1738
  

[Pg 23]

He feels his own poverty keenly:


This mournful truth is ev'ry where confess'd
Slow rises worth, by poverty depress'd.


"We may easily conceive" says Boswell "with
what feeling a great mind like this, cramped and
galled by narrow circumstances, uttered this last
line, which he marked by capitals."

London was a success.

"Everybody was delighted with it; and there
being no name to it, the first buz of the literary
circles was 'here is an unknown poet, greater even
than Pope.' And it is recorded in The Gentleman's
Magazine of that year [1738], that it 'got into the
second edition in the course of a week.'"

But Johnson got no more than ten guineas for
his work.

Truly, as Boswell says, "he felt the hardships of
writing for bread." So poor, indeed, did his prospects
seem, that he thought of turning schoolmaster
again or of entering the law. But he had no
university degree and there seemed no escape
from "the drudgery of authourship"       unless he
should take the advice of Mr Wilcox.

"Mr Wilcox, the bookseller, on being informed
by him that his intention was to get his livelihood
as an author, eyed his robust frame attentively,
and with a significant look, said 'You had better
buy a porter's knot.'"

Of his life during the first ten years after his
arrival in London we do not know many details.
He was miserably poor, but not entirely friendless.
His intimate companion for some time was
Richard Savage, whom "misfortunes and misconduct
[Pg 24]
had reduced to the lowest state of wretchedness
as a writer for bread."

Boswell finds it "melancholy to reflect that
Johnson and Savage were sometimes in such extreme
indigence that they could not pay for a
lodging; so that they have wandered together
whole nights in the streets.... He told Sir Joshua
Reynolds, that one night in particular, when
Savage and he walked round St James's-square
for want of a lodging, they were not at all depressed
by their situation; but in high spirits and brimful
of patriotism, traversed the square for several
hours, inveighed against the minister, and 'resolved
they would stand by their country.'"

A few years later Johnson wrote a Life of his
friend, sitting up all night and writing forty-eight
of the printed pages at a sitting.

"Soon after Savage's Life was published, Mr
Harte dined with Edward Cave, and occasionally
praised it. Soon after, meeting him, Cave said,
'You made a man very happy t'other day.'       'How
could that be?' says Harte; 'nobody was there
but ourselves.' Cave answered, by reminding him
that a plate of victuals was sent behind a screen,
which was to Johnson, dressed so shabbily, that
he did not choose to appear; but on hearing the
conversation, he was highly delighted with the
encomiums on his book."

For the copyright of the book Johnson received
fifteen guineas.

Such money, indeed, as Johnson earned at this
time came mostly from Mr Cave. To The Gentleman's
Magazine he contributed poems, essays,
[Pg 25]
lives of famous men, translations of foreign works
and accounts of debates in Parliament, taking
care, in these last, that "the Whig Dogs should
not have the best of it."

Few of these writings would be remembered if
their author had not become famous for other
reasons, and we maybe sure that Johnson was dissatisfied
with this kind of work. He was an
adventurer in literature and an adventurer likes
to tackle a big task.

Before long he found one big enough.

FOOTNOTES:




[2] See pages 33, 95.

granted to them by the treaty of Commerce. In the following year, 1739,
after the affair of "Jenkins's ear," Walpole was compelled to yield to
the popular demand for war.





The Great Lexicographer


The title of this chapter sounds dull enough.
A dictionary is not generally thought to be
lively reading and perhaps we may feel that a
man who deliberately set out to write one must
have been a dry-as-dust old fellow who went out
of his way to explain short and simple words by
means of long and complicated phrases more
difficult than the words themselves.

Well, there is no doubt that Johnson did use
long words. He had been brought up on classical
authors and, like other writers of the period, often
used words of many syllables derived from the
Greek or Latin, when simpler words would have
done as well.
[Pg 26]
Boswell is the same. He does not say "many
times in his later life" but "upon innumerable
occasions in his subsequent life." Or look back at
page 24, where he finds it "melancholy to reflect
that Johnson and Savage were in such extreme indigence."
Why couldn't he have found it "sad
to think that they were so poor"?

Long words were the fashion of the time and to
do Johnson justice, we must try to put ourselves
back in his century.

Nowadays, we have no trouble in finding dictionaries,
whether we want an exhaustive work
of reference or a handy volume for the pocket.

But in Johnson's day it was different.

Such dictionaries as had previously appeared
were vocabularies of "hard words" only, not of
words in general. The only attempt to produce a
dictionary containing all English words was that
compiled in 1721 by one Nathaniel Bailey, but
it contained very little illustration of the use of
words. There was, in fact, no dictionary which attempted
either to fix the language or to illustrate
the different meanings of a word by quotations
from English writers. Johnson began to consider
whether he might not produce one himself.

"The year 1747" says Boswell "is distinguished
as the epoch, when Johnson's arduous and important
work, his Dictionary of the English
Language, was announced to the world, by the
publication of its Plan or Prospectus. How long
this immense undertaking had been the object of
his contemplation, I do not know. I once asked
him by what means he had attained to that astonishing
[Pg 27]
knowledge of our language, by which he
was enabled to realise a design of such extent, and
accumulated difficulty. He told me, that 'it was
not the effect of particular study; but that it had
grown up in his mind insensibly.'"

Even Johnson had had some doubts at the
beginning:

"I have been informed by Mr James Dodsley,
that several years before this period, when Johnson
was one day sitting in his brother Robert's
shop, he heard his brother suggest to him, that a
Dictionary of the English Language would be a
work that would be well received by the publick;
that Johnson seemed at first to catch at the proposition,
but, after a pause, said, in his abrupt decisive
manner, 'I believe I shall not undertake it.'"

But he changed his mind. Half-a-dozen booksellers
agreed between them to pay the author
fifteen hundred and seventy-five pounds for the
work, and the "Plan" was addressed to the Earl
of Chesterfield, "then one of his Majesty's Principal
Secretaries of State; a nobleman who was
very ambitious of literary distinction."

England has always prided herself on the individual
enterprise of her citizens and Johnson "the
true-born Englishman" had now undertaken, "single
and unaided ... a work which in other countries
had not been effected but by the co-operating exertions
of many," but "he had a noble consciousness
of his own abilities, which enabled him to go
on with undaunted spirit."

Boswell gives us a few glimpses of his hero
engaged on this great task:

[Pg 28]

"Dr Adams found him one day busy at his
Dictionary, when the following dialogue ensued:
Adams. This is a great work, Sir.... How can you
do this in three years? Johnson. Sir, I have no
doubt that I can do it in three years. Adams. But
the French Academy, which consists of forty
members, took forty years to compile their Dictionary.
Johnson. Sir, thus it is: this is the proportion.
Let me see; forty times forty is sixteen
hundred. As three to sixteen hundred, so is the
proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman."

"For the mechanical part he employed, as he
told me, six amanuenses; and let it be remembered
by the natives of North-Britain, to whom he is supposed
to have been so hostile, that five of them
were of that country.... To all these painful labourers,
Johnson shewed a never-ceasing kindness."

"While the Dictionary was going forward, Johnson
lived part of the time in Holborn, part in
Gough-square, Fleet-street; and he had an upper
room fitted up like a counting-house for the purpose,
in which he gave to the copyists their several
tasks. The words, partly taken from other dictionaries,
and partly supplied by himself, having been
first written down with spaces left between them,
he delivered in writing their etymologies, definitions,
and various significations. The authorities
were copied from the books themselves, in which he
had marked the passages, with a black-lead pencil,
the traces of which could easily be effaced. I have
seen several of them, in which that trouble had not
been taken, so that they were just as when used by
the copyists."


  
  Johnson's House in Gough Square
  

No. 17 Gough Square, the house in which Johnson lived from
1748 to 1759, was bought in 1911 by Mr Cecil Harmsworth,
who undertook such restoration as was necessary. The visitor
will find it most easily by turning into Bolt Court, on the north
side of Fleet Street, and will note with satisfaction that "almost
every original feature of importance has survived."

A descriptive booklet, with a good coloured portrait, may be
bought at the house, and a well-illustrated account is given in
The Architectural Review for December, 1918. Carlyle's description
of his visit (Miscellaneous Essays, Vol. IV) is well known
and the reader may also be referred to Mr Austin Dobson's
A Garret in Gough Square (Eighteenth Century Vignettes, 1st Series)
and Miss Sophie Cole's novel, A London Posy.]

[Pg 29]

Though these pencil-marks do not remain for
us to see, the house in Gough Square still stands.
The literary adventurer of to-day may behold it
with something of that reverence which St John's
Gate inspired in Johnson when he first came to
London.

The Dictionary employed Johnson for eight
years.

"Mr Andrew Millar, bookseller in the Strand,
took the principal charge of conducting the publication....
When the messenger who carried the
last sheet to Millar returned, Johnson asked him
'Well, what did he say?'       'Sir (answered the messenger)
he said, Thank God I have done with
him.' 'I am glad (replied Johnson, with a smile)
that he thanks God for anything.'"

Lord Chesterfield, to whom the "Plan" had
been addressed, had taken no notice of Johnson
during his years of toil. Johnson had waited in his
"outward rooms" and been "repulsed from his
door"       an incident which a famous picture has
made familiar to many who otherwise, perhaps,
would hardly have heard either of the rich nobleman
or of the "uncourtly scholar."

On the eve of publication, however, Lord Chesterfield
attempted to make amends by two
complimentary notices in a paper called The
World. This provoked Johnson to write one of
the best known letters in English literature. Here
is a part of it:

"Seven years, my Lord, have now passed, since
I waited in your outward rooms, or was repulsed
from your door; during which time I have been
[Pg 30]
pushing on my work through difficulties, of which
it is useless to complain, and have brought it, at
last, to the verge of publication, without one act
of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one
smile of favour. Such treatment I did not expect,
for I never had a Patron before....

Is not a Patron, my Lord, one who looks with
unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water,
and, when he has reached ground, encumbers him
with help? The notice which you have been pleased
to take of my labours, had it been early, had been
kind; but it has been delayed till I am indifferent,
and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary, and cannot
impart it; till I am known, and do not want it. I
hope it is no very cynical asperity not to confess
obligations where no benefit has been received, or
to be unwilling that the Publick should consider
me as owing that to a Patron, which Providence
has enabled me to do for myself."

This fine piece of snubbing, written, as Johnson
said, in defensive pride, became "the talk of the
town." But Johnson did not wish it to be public
property. When Lord Hardwicke expressed a
wish to read it, he "declined to comply with the
request, saying, with a smile 'No, Sir; I have hurt
the dog too much already.'"

"The Dictionary" says Boswell "with a Grammar
and History of the English Language being now
at length published, in two volumes folio, the
world contemplated with wonder so stupendous a
work achieved by one man."

We, too, may do the same, though we may be
frightened, rather than attracted, by the sentence
[Pg 31]
which Boswell selects from the Preface as a model
of clearness and choice of words:

"When the radical idea branches out into parallel
ramifications, how can a consecutive series be
formed of senses in their own nature collateral?"

We shall do better to choose one or two of the
passages which should move us even now, when
we picture to ourselves the years of industry and
poverty in the gloomy Gough Square house:
"The chief glory of every people arises from its
authors: whether I shall add anything by my own
writings to the reputation of English literature
must be left to time."

"I deliver my book to the world with the spirit
of a man that has endeavoured well.... In this work,
when it shall be found that much is omitted, let it
not be forgotten that much likewise is performed;
and though no book was ever spared out of tenderness
to the author, and the world is little
solicitous to know whence proceeded the faults of
that which it condemns; yet it may gratify curiosity
to inform it, that the English Dictionary was written
with little assistance of the learned, and without
any patronage of the great; not in the soft obscurities
of retirement, or under the shelter of
academick bowers, but amidst inconvenience and
distraction, in sickness and in sorrow."

The Dictionary itself is not, of course, to be
compared in fulness or accuracy with the latest
monument of lexicography which we find on
library shelves to-day       any more than Marlborough's
artillery can be compared with a modern
howitzer.

[Pg 32]

"The definitions" says Boswell "have always
appeared to me such astonishing proofs of acuteness
of intellect and precision of language, as
indicate a genius of the highest rank. This it is
which marks the superiour excellence of Johnson's
Dictionary over others."

But even Boswell has to admit, as Johnson did,
that there are errors and obscurities, "inconsiderable
specks" though they be.

"Thus Windward and Leeward, though directly
of opposite meaning, are defined identically the
same way."

"A lady once asked him how he came to define
Pastern the knee of a horse; instead of making an
elaborate defence, as she expected, he at once
answered, 'Ignorance, Madam,       pure ignorance.'"

"His definition of Network has been often
quoted with sportive malignity, as obscuring a
thing in itself very plain."

Boswell tantalises us by omitting this definition.
But, to set curiosity at rest, here it is:
"Anything reticulated or decussated, at equal
distances, with interstices between the intersections."

A man of strong prejudices like Johnson could
not refrain from letting his own views appear here
and there throughout the work and it is these
human touches which have most attraction for us
to-day. We can imagine the grim smile which
came over his scarred and rugged face when he
defined:

Oats as "A grain which in England is generally
[Pg 33]
given to horses, but in Scotland supports the
people
[4]."

Whig as "The name of a faction."

Grub-street as "the name of a street in London,
much inhabited by writers of small histories,
dictionaries, and temporary poems."

Lexicographer as "a writer of dictionaries; a
harmless drudge."

"Dictionaries," as Johnson himself wrote thirty
years later, "are like watches, the worst is better
than none, and the best cannot be expected to go
true."

But what we chiefly have to remember is that
Johnson was a pioneer. There was no good
English dictionary in 1747. Johnson set to work
single-handed, and produced a book which made
its author supreme amongst the literary men of
the time and itself remained a standard work for
generations.


FOOTNOTES:



[4] The latter part of the definition was omitted by Johnson in the
last edition which he passed for press.




The Great Cham of Literature


The Dictionary was Johnson's biggest literary
adventure, but it was not the only one which
occupied him in the years between 1747 and
1755. Even the great Lexicographer would have
found it hard to do nothing but "beat the track
[Pg 34]
of the alphabet" for eight years; for, as Boswell
puts it, "his enlarged and lively mind could not be
satisfied without more diversity of employment
and the pleasure of animated relaxation."

There was another reason, too, which made it
necessary for Johnson to write something besides
definitions. 1500 guineas was not much on which
to keep six assistants and himself for eight years.
"When the expence of amanuenses and paper, and
other articles are deducted, his clear profit was
very inconsiderable." But Johnson, being a true
adventurer, did not grumble. When Boswell said
to him "I am sorry, Sir, you did not get more for
your Dictionary," his answer was "I am sorry too.
But it was very well. The booksellers are generous,
liberal-minded men."

So, in 1749, Johnson offered to one of these
booksellers, Mr James Dodsley, a poem called
The Vanity of Human Wishes and received the sum
of fifteen guineas.

It was written in imitation, as London had been,
of the Roman poet Juvenal. The subject is a
gloomy one and Garrick thought it "as hard as
Greek." But parts of the poem are still familiar
to everyone       the opening lines, for instance:


Let observation with extensive view
Survey mankind, from China to Peru.


Various ambitious careers are described, such
as those of Wolsey and Charles XII of Sweden;
and a bitter warning is given to the literary adventurer,
"the young enthusiast" who "quits his
ease for fame."

[Pg 35]


Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes,
And pause awhile from letters, to be wise;
There mark what ills the scholar's life assail,
Toil, envy, want, the patron[5] and the jail.


David Garrick was by this time a famous actor.
He was manager of Drury Lane theatre, and,
after a good deal of dispute, it was arranged that
Johnson's tragedy Irene, written some years before,
should be put upon the stage. It was a play
dealing with an Oriental court and Garrick was
rehearsing the part of Mahomet.

"'Sir' said Johnson to a friend, 'the fellow
wants me to make Mahomet run mad, that he
may have an opportunity of tossing his hands
and kicking his heels.'"

Here is an account of the first night:

"Before the curtain drew up, there were catcalls
whistling, which alarmed Johnson's friends.
The Prologue, which was written by himself in
a manly strain, soothed the audience, and the play
went off tolerably, till it came to the conclusion,
when Mrs Pritchard, the heroine of the piece,
was to be strangled upon the stage, and was to
speak two lines with the bow-string round her
neck. The audience cried out 'Murder! Murder!'
She several times attempted to speak; but in vain.
At last she was obliged to go off the stage alive."

This was Johnson's one adventure as a writer
of plays and he no doubt enjoyed it. Everyone
loves to go "behind the scenes."

"His necessary attendance while his play was
[Pg 36]
in rehearsal, and during its performance, brought
him acquainted with many of the performers of
both sexes.... With some of them he kept up an
acquaintance as long as he and they lived, and
was ever ready to shew them acts of kindness. He
for a considerable time used to frequent the Green
Room, and seemed to take delight in dissipating
his gloom, by mixing in the sprightly chit-chat
of the motley circle then to be found there."

He felt, too, that his own dress should be in
keeping with the gay clothes of those around him:

"On occasion of his play being brought upon
the stage, Johnson had a fancy that as a dramatick
authour his dress should be more gay than what
he ordinarily wore; he therefore appeared behind
the scenes, and even in one of the side boxes, in
a scarlet waistcoat, with rich gold lace, and a gold-laced
hat."

But Irene was not a success.

"Notwithstanding all the support of such
performers as Garrick, Barry, Mrs Cibber, Mrs
Pritchard, and every advantage of dress and decoration,
the tragedy of Irene did not please the
publick." However "Mr Garrick's zeal carried
it through for nine nights, so that the authour
had his three nights' profits."

These, together with the hundred pounds
which Johnson received from Mr Dodsley for
the copyright, made it, at any rate, a profitable
adventure and "when asked how he felt upon
the ill success of his tragedy, he replied, 'Like
the Monument'; meaning that he continued firm
and unmoved as that column."

[Pg 37]

In the following year, 1750, he set out upon
another adventure. It was nearly forty years since
the last numbers of The Tatler and The Spectator,
written by the famous essayists of Queen Anne's
reign       Joseph Addison and Richard Steele       had
appeared.

Johnson now embarked upon a similar periodical
paper in which, as Boswell says, "he came
forth as a majestick teacher of moral and religious
wisdom."

The choice of a title gave him some trouble:
"What must be done, Sir," he afterwards told
Sir Joshua Reynolds "will be done. When I was
to begin publishing that paper, I was at a loss how
to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside,
and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I
had fixed its title. The Rambler seemed the best
that occurred, and I took it."

"The first paper of the Rambler" Boswell tells
us "was published on Tuesday the 20th of March
1750; and its authour was enabled to continue it,
without interruption, every Tuesday and Friday,
till Saturday[6] the 17th of March, 1752, on which
day it closed.... Many of these discourses, which
we should suppose had been laboured with all the
slow attention of literary leisure, were written in
haste as the moment pressed, without even being
read over by him before they were printed."

Like Irene, The Rambler did not really "please
the publick." The matter was too solid for a two-penny
paper, and less than 500 copies of each
[Pg 38]
number were sold. Boswell speaks sadly of this
lack of success:

"The grave and often solemn cast of thinking,
which distinguished it from other periodical
papers, made it, for some time, not generally liked.
So slowly did this excellent work, of which twelve
editions have now issued from the press, gain
upon the world at large, that even in the closing
number the authour says, 'I have never been
much a favourite with the publick.'"

But from one source, at any rate, Johnson got
honest praise:

"Mrs Johnson, in whose judgement and taste
he had great confidence, said to him, after a few
numbers of the Rambler had come out 'I thought
very well of you before; but I did not imagine
you could have written anything equal to this.'"

"Distant praise, from whatever quarter," adds
Boswell "is not so delightful as that of a wife
whom a man loves and esteems."

Johnson was now emerging from the period
of "cold obscurity." He had begun to gather a
circle of friends round him and had founded the
first of his clubs "in Ivy-lane, Paternoster-row,
with a view to enjoy literary discussion, and
amuse his evening hours." His character, though
not his income, in the literary world was "deservedly
high" and one honour which came to
him in 1754 was especially pleasing to him       the
conferment of the degree of Master of Arts by
the University of Oxford. We can see how much
he looked forward to this by a phrase in one of his
letters at the time: "I shall be extremely glad to
[Pg 39]
hear from you again, to know if the affair [of the
degree] proceeds. I have mentioned it to none of
my friends for fear of being laughed at for my
disappointment."

"In 1755 we behold him" says Boswell "to
great advantage; his degree of Master of Arts
conferred upon him, his Dictionary published, his
correspondence animated, his benevolence exercised."
But in the following year "Johnson found
that the great fame of his Dictionary had not set
him above the necessity of 'making provision for
the day that was passing over him.' No royal or
noble patron extended a munificent hand to give
independence to the man who had conferred
stability on the language of his country."

In other words, he must still write for a living.
"Ten guineas" he afterwards said "was to me
at that time a great sum" and he did not disdain
to accept a guinea from Mr Robert Dodsley, "for
writing the introduction to The London Chronicle,
an evening news-paper."

He tried his hand, too, at another series of
essays which, under the name of The Idler, came
out every Saturday in a weekly newspaper. Boswell
says that these essays have "less body and
more spirit" than The Rambler and refers to one
"in which conversation is assimilated to a bowl
of punch." Many of them were written "as
hastily as an ordinary letter."

"Mr Langton remembers Johnson, when on
a visit at Oxford, asking him one evening how
long it was till the post went out; and on being
told about half an hour, he exclaimed, 'then we
[Pg 40]
shall do very well.' He upon this instantly sat
down and finished an Idler, which it was necessary
should be in London the next day. Mr Langton
having signified a wish to read it, 'Sir, (said he)
you shall not do more than I have done myself.'
He then folded it up and sent it off."

Johnson, at the age of 49, was still writing in
the spirit of the journalist.

A more ambitious work was Rasselas, Prince of
Abissinia, a tale of the East. This became very
popular and was "translated into most, if not all,
of the modern languages." It was written in the
same hurried way as The Rambler and The Idler:

"Johnson wrote it, that with the profits he
might defray the expence of his mother's funeral,
and pay some little debts which she had left. He
told Sir Joshua Reynolds that he had composed
it in the evenings of one week, sent it to the press
in portions as it was written, and had never since
read it over[7]. Mr Strahan, Mr Johnston, and
Mr Dodsley purchased it for a hundred pounds,
but afterwards paid him twenty-five pounds more,
when it came to a second edition."

Besides these works and an edition of Shakespeare
which employed him for many years,
Johnson wrote a number of essays, reviews of
books, prefaces and dedications. From one of these,
a defence of tea-drinking, we must quote a sentence
later, for Boswell gives it as his opinion
that "his chief Intention seems to have been to
make Sport."

And now Johnson's career as "an adventurer
[Pg 41]
in literature" is nearly at an end. What is, in some
ways, the most important event of his life is thus
described by Boswell:

"The accession of George the Third to the
throne of these kingdoms, opened a new and
brighter prospect to men of literary merit, who
had been honoured with no mark of royal favour
in the preceding reign. His present Majesty's
education in this country, as well as his taste and
beneficence, prompted him to be patron of science
and the arts; and early this year Johnson, having
been represented to him as a very learned and
good man, without any certain provision, his
Majesty was pleased to grant him a pension of
three hundred pounds a year."

Johnson, being an honest man, had some
qualms. In the two previous reigns he had been
bitterly opposed to the government and had not
hesitated to say so. Moreover, he had defined
Pension in his Dictionary as "pay given to a state
hireling for treason to his country[8]"! Could he
honestly take the money? He went off at once
to consult Sir Joshua Reynolds:

"Sir Joshua answered that ... there could be no
objection to his receiving from the King a reward
for literary merit; and that certainly the definitions
in his Dictionary were not applicable to him.
Johnson, it should seem, was satisfied, for he did
not call again till he had accepted the pension,
and had waited on Lord Bute
[9] to thank him. He
[Pg 42]
then told Sir Joshua that Lord Bute said to him
expressly, 'It is not given you for anything you are
to do, but for what you have done.' His Lordship,
he said, behaved in the handsomest manner.
He repeated the words twice, that he might be
sure Johnson heard them, and thus set his mind
perfectly at ease."

No one was ever more fervently grateful than
Johnson, who at the age of 53, had never known
a day's good health or a year's steady income.
He, who had compiled the Dictionary, declared:

"The English language does not afford me
terms adequate to my feelings on this occasion.
I must have recourse to the French. I am pénétré
with his Majesty's goodness."

Twenty years later his gratitude was still fresh:

"Sir, I have never complained of the world;
nor do I think that I have reason to complain.
It is rather to be wondered at that I have so much.
My pension is more out of the usual course of
things than any instance that I have known. Here,
Sir, was a man avowedly no friend to Government
at the time, who got a pension without
asking for it."

A few years after the publication of the Dictionary
Tobias Smollett, the novelist, had referred
to Johnson as "the great Cham of literature."
The title was adapted from that of the fierce chiefs
of the Tartars, and it suits Johnson well enough.
He held the foremost place in the literary society
of his day and in taverns and great men's halls
alike could proclaim his opinions on literature and
art, history and politics, morality and religion to
[Pg 43]
men who, though "eminent in their departments,"
regarded it as an honour to be allowed to listen
to him.

Lord Chesterfield, half in jest and half in earnest,
had conferred on him the powers of a literary
"dictator." The king's pension enabled Johnson
to use his powers in a way of which Chesterfield
had not dreamed.

Henceforward we know him not as a poet or
essayist or even as "the great Lexicographer,"
but simply as "Doctor Johnson[10]," the talker, the
traveller, the true-born Englishman.

With the exception of some political pamphlets,
an account of his Scottish tour, and a series of
Lives of the Poets, he wrote little of importance
after 1762, comparing himself to a soldier who
has fought a good many campaigns and is not to
be blamed for retiring to ease and tranquillity.

Boswell. 'But I wonder, Sir, you have not
more pleasure in writing than in not writing.'

Johnson. 'Sir, you may wonder.'

Johnson's Household


So far we have seen little of Johnson's domestic
life. He was happiest in a club or a tavern
and, in the early days of struggle, home was not
much more for him than the place where he sat
[Pg 44]
down to write for a living. In his garret, which
he considered as his library, a visitor would find
"about five or six Greek folios, a deal writing-desk,
and a chair and a half. Johnson giving to his
guest the entire seat, tottered himself on one with
only three legs and one arm."

But the household which he gradually gathered
round him was a remarkable one.

Of Mrs Johnson's life in London we do not
know much; but Johnson, being slovenly in his
habits and cantankerous about his food, was
bound to have "little disagreements" with a tidy
housewife.

"My wife" he told Mrs Thrale "had a particular
reverence for cleanliness, and desired the
praise of neatness in her dress and furniture, as
many ladies do, till they become troublesome to
their best friends, slaves to their own besoms,
and only sigh for the hour of sweeping their
husbands out of the house as dirt and useless
lumber."

When asked whether he ever "huffed his wife
about his dinner," he replied:

"So often that at last she called to me, and said,
'Nay, hold, Mr Johnson, and do not make a farce
of thanking God for a dinner which in a few minutes
you will protest not eatable.'"

Sometimes she would get tired of the dirt and
poverty of Fleet Street and stay for a time at
Hampstead; but she could appreciate her husband's
work and of Johnson's fondness for "his
dear Tetty" there can be no doubt.

She died in March 1752, when Johnson had
[Pg 45]
just finished the last number of The Rambler and
was still in the middle of his labours on the
Dictionary. Here is the letter he wrote on the
following day to his friend, Dr Taylor:



"Dear Sir,

Let me have your company and instruction.
Do not live away from me. My distress is
great.

Pray desire Mrs Taylor to inform me what
mourning I should buy for my mother and Miss
Porter
[11],
and bring a note in writing with you.

Remember me in your prayers, for vain is the
help of man.

I am, dear Sir,      c.,
Sam. Johnson.


March 18, 1752."

"'Sir,' he said twenty-six years later 'I have
known what it was to have a wife, and (in a
solemn tender faultering tone) I have known
what it is to lose a wife.       It had almost broke
my heart.'"

Long before the pension had given him security
Johnson had begun to make his home a refuge
for the poor and lonely:

"Though Johnson's circumstances were at this
time far from being easy, his humane and charitable
disposition was constantly exerting itself.
Mrs Anna Williams, daughter of a very ingenious
Welsh physician, and a woman of more than
ordinary talents and literature, having come to
London in hopes of being cured of a cataract in
[Pg 46]
both her eyes, which afterwards ended in total
blindness, was kindly received as a constant visitor
at his house while Mrs Johnson lived; and after
her death, having come under his roof in order
to have an operation upon her eyes performed
with more comfort to her than in lodgings, she
had an apartment from him during the rest of her
life, at all times when he had a house."

From the accounts we have of Mrs Williams
we cannot imagine her to have been an easy companion.
Her blindness made her peevish and
quarrelsome and we may wonder, with Boswell,
at Johnson's patience with her. But she was a good
talker and that was a great merit in Johnson's
eyes. He made many efforts to brighten her life
and increase her tiny income; Garrick was induced
to give her a benefit performance and Mrs Montagu
to provide her with a small pension.

"The truth is," says Boswell "that his humane
consideration of the forlorn and indigent state in
which this lady was left by her father, induced him
to treat her with the utmost tenderness, and even
to be desirous of procuring her amusement, so
as sometimes to incommode many of his friends,
by carrying her with him to their houses, where,
from her manner of eating, in consequence of her
blindness, she could not but offend the delicacy
of persons of nice sensations."

But Boswell was a proud man when he was first
invited to drink tea with her after dining out with
Johnson. He knew that it was a sign of real intimacy.

"We went home to his house to tea. Mrs
[Pg 47]
Williams made it with sufficient dexterity, notwithstanding
her blindness, though her manner
of satisfying herself that the cups were full enough
appeared to me a little aukward; for I fancied she
put her finger down a certain way, till she felt the
tea touch it
[12].
In my first elation at being allowed
the privilege of attending Dr Johnson at his late
visits to this lady ..., I willingly drank cup after
cup."

Nor was the lady's dinner forgotten when Boswell
and Johnson went off to their tavern:

"There was, on these occasions, a little circumstance
of kind attention to Mrs Williams, which
must not be omitted. Before coming out, and
leaving her to dine alone, he gave her her choice
of a chicken, a sweetbread, or any other little nice
thing, which was carefully sent to her from the
tavern, ready-drest."

Her death left Johnson very desolate.

"I have lost a companion," he wrote "to whom
I have had recourse for domestick amusement for
thirty years, and whose variety of knowledge never
was exhausted.... She left her little substance to
a charity-school. She is, I hope, where there is
neither darkness, nor want, nor sorrow."

About 1746 Johnson had made the acquaintance
of another "humble friend," Mr Robert
Levet.

"He was" says Boswell "an obscure practiser in
[Pg 48]
physick amongst the lower people, his fees being
sometimes very small sums, sometimes whatever
provisions his patients could afford him; but of
such extensive practice in that way, that Mrs
Williams has told me, his walk was from Hounsditch
to Marybone.... Such was Johnson's predilection
for him, and fanciful estimation of his
moderate abilities, that I have heard him say he
should not be satisfied, though attended by all the
College of Physicians, unless he had Mr Levet
with him. Ever since I was acquainted with Dr
Johnson, and many years before, as I have been
assured by those who knew him earlier, Mr Levet
had an apartment in his house, or his chambers,
and waited upon him every morning, through
the whole course of his late and tedious breakfast.
He was of a strange grotesque appearance, stiff
and formal in his manner, and seldom said a word
while any company was present."

But this "odd old surgeon" was poor and honest;
and that, as Goldsmith said, was recommendation
enough to Johnson, who never treated him
as a dependent and indeed declared that "Levet
was indebted to him for nothing more than house-room,
his share in a penny-loaf at breakfast, and
now and then a dinner on a Sunday." The
greatest honour which Johnson paid his old friend
were the "pathetick verses" which he wrote at
his death. Here we will quote two stanzas:


Well try'd through many a varying year
See Levett to the grave descend;
Officious, innocent, sincere,
Of every friendless name the friend.


[Pg 49]

His virtues walk'd their narrow round,
Nor made a pause, nor left a void;
And sure the Eternal Master found
His single talent well employ'd.


For five years towards the end of his life Johnson
had a further addition to his household.

"On Friday, March 20, [1778]" says Boswell
"I found him at his own house, sitting with Mrs
Williams, and was informed that the room formerly
allotted to me was now appropriated to a
charitable purpose; Mrs Desmoulins[13], and I think
her daughter, and a Miss Carmichael, being all
lodged in it. Such was his humanity, and such his
generosity, that Mrs Desmoulins herself told me,
he allowed her half-a-guinea a week. Let it be remembered,
that this was above a twelfth part of
his pension."

The invasion had, as we shall see, a disturbing
effect on the household and it was well that Johnson
had a devoted servant.

This was Francis Barber, a negro who had been
brought to England in 1750 and received his
freedom (for the slave trade still flourished) from
his master, Colonel Bathurst. Dr Bathurst, the
Colonel's son, was a very intimate friend of Johnson
and gave him Francis as a servant. Johnson,
as his way was, made of him a friend. Francis
once took a fancy to go to sea; but Johnson had
a horror of the sailor's life and got him back.
Finding him intelligent and worth a better education
he sent him to school at Bishop Stortford.

Here are two letters which shew Johnson's
fatherly kindness:

[Pg 50]

"To Mr Francis Barber.



Dear Francis,

I have been very much out of order.
I am glad to hear that you are well, and design
to come soon to see you. I would have you stay
at Mrs Clapp's for the present, till I can determine
what we shall do. Be a good boy.

My compliments to Mrs Clapp and to Mr
Fowler. I am,


Yours affectionately,
Sam. Johnson.



May 28, 1768."



"To Mr Francis Barber, at Mrs Clapp's,
Bishop-Stortford, Hertfordshire.



Dear Francis,

I am at last sat down to write to you,
and should very much blame myself for having
neglected you so long, if I did not impute that
and many other failings to want of health. I hope
not to be so long silent again. I am very well
satisfied with your progress, if you can really
perform the exercises which you are set....

Let me know what English books you read for
your entertainment. You can never be wise unless
you love reading.

Do not imagine that I shall forget or forsake
you; for if, when I examine you, I find that you
have not lost your time, you shall want no encouragement
from


Yours affectionately,
Sam. Johnson.



London, Sept. 25, 1770."

[Pg 51]

After his four years' schooling Francis returned
to London and remained a faithful servant till his
master's death. When Johnson was making his
will he "asked Dr Brocklesby what would be a
proper annuity to a favourite servant, and being
answered that it must depend on the circumstances
of the master; and, that in the case of a
nobleman, fifty pounds a year was considered as
an adequate reward for many years' faithful service;
'Then (said Johnson,) shall I be nobilissimus,
for I mean to leave Frank seventy pounds a year,
and I desire you to tell him so.'"

Lastly, we must mention a fireside creature
that Johnson loved:

"I shall never forget" says Boswell "the indulgence
with which he treated Hodge, his cat:
for whom he himself used to go out and buy
oysters, lest the servants having that trouble
should take a dislike to the poor creature. I am,
unluckily, one of those who have an antipathy to
a cat, so that I am uneasy when in the room with
one; and I own, I frequently suffered a good deal
from the presence of this same Hodge. I recollect
him one day scrambling up Dr Johnson's breast,
apparently with much satisfaction, while my friend
smiling and half-whistling, rubbed down his back,
and pulled him by the tail; and when I observed
he was a fine cat, saying, 'Why yes, Sir, but I have
had cats whom I liked better than this'; and then
as if perceiving Hodge to be out of countenance,
adding, 'but he is a very fine cat, a very fine cat
indeed.'"

[Pg 52]

How did this "crowd of wretched old creatures,"
as Macaulay rather unkindly calls them,
agree? Not very well. Hodge was probably the
only peaceful member.

In 1778 the following conversation took place
between Johnson and his friends Mr and Mrs
Thrale:

"Mrs Thrale. Pray, Sir, how does Mrs Williams
like all this tribe? Dr Johnson. Madam,
she does not like them at all; but their fondness
for her is not greater. She and Desmoulins
quarrel incessantly.... Mr Thrale. And pray
who is clerk of your kitchen, Sir? Dr Johnson.
Why, Sir, I am afraid there is none; a general
anarchy prevails in my kitchen, as I am told by
Mr Levett, who says it is not now what it used
to be. Mrs Thrale. Mr Levett, I suppose, Sir,
has the office of keeping the hospital in health,
for he is an apothecary. Dr Johnson. Levett,
Madam, is a brutal fellow, but I have a good
regard for him; for his brutality is in his manners,
not his mind. Mr Thrale. But how do you get
your dinners drest? Dr Johnson. Why, Desmoulins
has the chief management of the kitchen;
but our roasting is not magnificent, for we have no
jack. Mr Thrale. No jack! Why, how do they
manage without? Dr Johnson. Small joints, I
believe, they manage with a string, and larger are
done at the tavern.... Mrs Thrale. But pray,
Sir, who is the Poll[14]
you talk of? She that you
used to abet in her quarrels with Mrs Williams,
and call out, At her again, Poll! Never flinch, Poll!
[Pg 53]
Dr Johnson. Why, I took to Poll very well at
first, but she won't do upon a nearer examination.
Mrs Thrale. How came she among you, Sir?
Dr Johnson. Why I don't rightly remember, but
we could spare her very well from us. Poll is a
stupid slut. I had some hopes of her at first;
but when I talked to her tightly and closely,
I could make nothing of her; she was wiggle
waggle...."

Nothing, perhaps, makes us realise more fully
Johnson's largeness of heart than the picture of
his extraordinary household.

Goldsmith was right when he said: "Johnson,
to be sure, has a roughness in his manner; but
no man alive has a more tender heart. He has
nothing of the bear but his skin."

acquired such a niceness of touch, as to know, by the feeling on the
outside of the cup, how near it was to being full."

His daily Life


Johnson could tolerate the quarrels of his
household and the anarchy of his kitchen
better than most men, for the simple reason that
he generally dined out at about 2 o'clock and
stayed in a club or a tavern or a friend's house
until bedtime. A tavern chair was for him "the
throne of human felicity" and we shall shortly
see him as he loved best to be       "folding his legs
and having his talk out" with his friends.

First, let us see something of his daily habits
[Pg 54]
and manner of life. Here is Boswell's description
of him in later years:

"His person was large, robust, I may say approaching
to the gigantick, and grown unwieldy
from corpulency. His countenance was naturally
of the cast of an ancient statue, but somewhat disfigured
by the scars of that evil, which, it was
formerly imagined, the royal touch could cure. He
was now ... become a little dull of hearing. His
sight had always been somewhat weak; yet, so
much does mind govern, and even supply the
deficiency of organs, that his perceptions were
uncommonly quick and accurate. His head, and
sometime also his body shook with a kind of
motion like the effect of a palsy: he appeared
to be frequently disturbed by cramps, or convulsive
contractions, of the nature of that distemper
called St Vitus's dance. He wore a full suit of plain
brown clothes, with twisted hair-buttons of the
same colour, a large bushy greyish wig, a plain
shirt, black worsted stockings, and silver buckles."

His day began late with a breakfast consisting
of a penny-loaf and a large pot of tea. It was not
usually a very tidy meal, for Johnson often appeared
"in deshabille, as just risen from bed";
Levet poured out the tea, while Johnson clumsily
divided the bread.

When there was a guest, however, his "tea and
rolls and butter, and whole breakfast apparatus
were all in such decorum, and his behaviour was
so courteous" that the visitor "was quite surprised,
and wondered at his having heard so much
said of Johnson's slovenliness and roughness."

[Pg 55]

Once, when Boswell called unexpectedly before
he was up, he called briskly "Frank, go and get
coffee, and let us breakfast in splendour."

But these splendid occasions were exceptional.

"About twelve o'clock" wrote Dr Maxwell,
a 'social friend' of Johnson, "I commonly visited
him, and frequently found him in bed, or declaiming
over his tea, which he drank very plentifully.
He generally had a levee of morning visitors,
chiefly men of letters; Hawkesworth, Goldsmith,
Murphy, Langton, Steevens, Beauclerk      c.      c.,
and sometimes learned ladies, particularly I remember
a French lady of wit and fashion doing
him the honour of a visit. He seemed to be considered
as a kind of publick oracle, whom every
body thought they had a right to visit and consult;
and doubtless they were well rewarded. I never
could discover how he found time for his compositions.
He declaimed all the morning, then went
to dinner at a tavern, where he commonly staid
late, and then drank his tea at some friend's house,
over which he loitered a great while, but seldom
took supper. I fancy he must have read and wrote
chiefly in the night, for I can scarcely recollect
that he ever refused going with me to a tavern,
and he often went to Ranelagh, which he deemed
a place of innocent recreation. He frequently
gave all the silver in his pocket to the poor, who
watched him, between his house and the tavern
where he dined. He walked the streets at all
hours and said he was never robbed, for the
rogues knew he had little money, nor had the
appearance of having much."

[Pg 56]

Such was Johnson's week-day life. Sunday
was another matter.

"It should be different (he observed) from
another day. People may walk, but not throw
stones at birds. There may be relaxation, but
there should be no levity."

He made some good resolutions accordingly:


"To rise early, and in order to it, to go to
sleep early on Saturday....
To read the Scripture methodically....
To go to church twice.
To read books of Divinity....
To wear off by meditation any worldly soil
contracted in the week."

As he himself confessed, he did not always keep
his resolutions, but that religion was a real part of
Johnson's life and work is shewn not only by a
score of incidents and conversations recorded by
Boswell, but by the numerous Prayers and Meditations
which were collected and published after
his death. This was his prayer as he began the
second volume of the Dictionary:

"O God, who hast hitherto supported me,
enable me to proceed in this labour, and in the
whole task of my present state; that when I shall
render up, at the last day, an account of the talent
committed to me, I may receive pardon, for the
sake of Jesus Christ. Amen."

His favourite place of worship was St Clement
Danes and in the churchyard to-day we may
see his figure facing the street he loved best and
still seeming ready to "defend the most minute
[Pg 57]
circumstance connected with the Church of
England."

Partly from ill-health, partly by natural disposition,
Johnson was incurably lazy.

"I have been trying" he told Boswell "to cure
my laziness all my life, and could not do it."

He slept badly and had no inclination to go to
bed; indeed he seldom came home till two in the
morning. Nor, as we shall see[15], did he mind
being roused in the middle of the night, if there
was some fun to be had.

"He has more fun" said his friend Miss Burney
"and comical humour and love of nonsense about
him than almost anybody I ever saw."

His laugh was "a kind of good humoured
growl" or, as Tom Davies the bookseller described
it, "he laughed like a rhinoceros."

Boswell could not always share this boisterous
amusement and was puzzled at his hero being
"exceedingly diverted at what seemed to others
a very small sport."

One evening they were sitting in the Temple
with a lawyer named Chambers who had just been
drawing up a will for Johnson's friend, Langton.
Johnson's sense of humour was for some reason
keenly tickled by this; he twitted Chambers with
having made the will himself and ran on in a
playful manner, "which certainly was not such
as might be expected from the authour of The
Rambler."

"Ha, ha, ha!" he bellowed "I hope he has left
[Pg 58]
me a legacy. I'd have his will turned into verse,
like a ballad."

In the street, "Johnson could not stop his merriment,
but continued it all the way till we got without
the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a
fit of laughter, that he appeared to be almost in
a convulsion; and, in order to support himself,
laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the
foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that
in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound
from Temple-bar to Fleet-ditch."

Poor Boswell is almost ashamed to record what
he calls "this most ludicrous exhibition of the
aweful, melancholy, and venerable Johnson,"
but most of his readers prefer this picture of
Johnson staggering in helpless laughter down
Fleet Street to the most impressive essay in
The Rambler.

Johnson's oddities in the street must often
have made people turn round to look at him. He
always took care, for instance, "to go out or in at
a door or passage by a certain number of steps
from a certain point, or at least so as that either
his right or his left foot, (I am not certain which,)
should constantly make the first actual movement
when he came close to the door or passage. Thus
I conjecture: for I have, upon innumerable occasions,
observed him suddenly stop, and then seem
to count his steps with a deep earnestness; and
when he had neglected or gone wrong in this sort
of magical movement, I have seen him go back
again, put himself in a proper posture to begin the
ceremony, and, having gone through it, break
[Pg 59]
from his abstraction, walk briskly on, and join his
companion."

He was full of these childish tricks. He would
never, if he could help it, step on the cracks between
paving-stones; when passing a row of posts,
he was careful to touch the top of each with his
hand; and all the time he would probably be talking
to himself and jerking his head and limbs in
the queer way which was habitual with him.

Indoors he was the same. Strangers could not
make him out:

"Johnson used to be a pretty frequent visitor at
the house of Mr Richardson, authour of Clarissa,
and other novels of extensive reputation. Mr
Hogarth came one day to see Richardson, soon
after the execution of Dr Cameron, for having
taken arms for the house of Stuart in 1745-6."

Hogarth was "a warm partisan of George the
Second" and defended the king's decision.

"While he was talking, he perceived a person
standing at a window in the room, shaking his head,
and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous
manner. He concluded that he was an ideot, whom
his relations had put under the care of Mr Richardson,
as a very good man. To his great surprize,
however, this figure stalked forwards to where he
and Mr Richardson were sitting, and all at once
took up the argument, and burst out into an invective
against George the Second, as one, who, upon
all occasions, was unrelenting and barbarous.... He
displayed such a power of eloquence, that Hogarth
looked at him with astonishment, and actually
imagined that this ideot had been at the moment
[Pg 60]
inspired. Neither Hogarth nor Johnson were
made known to each other at this interview."

It is a pity Hogarth has not left us a picture of
the scene.

Although he never wished to have a child of his
own, Johnson had a warm corner in his heart for
young people:

"Mr Strahan [the printer] had taken a poor boy
from the country as an apprentice, upon Johnson's
recommendation. Johnson having enquired after
him, said, 'Mr Strahan, let me have five guineas
on account, and I'll give this boy one. Nay, if a
man recommends a boy, and does nothing for him,
it is sad work. Call him down.' I followed him
into the court-yard, behind Mr Strahan's house....
'Well, my boy, how do you go on?'       'Pretty well,
Sir; but they are afraid I an't strong enough for
some parts of the business.' Johnson. 'Why, I
shall be sorry for it; for when you consider with
how little mental power and corporeal labour a
printer can get a guinea a week, it is a very desirable
occupation for you. Do you hear,       take all
the pains you can; and if this does not do, we must
think of some other way of life for you. There's
a guinea.'"

To his friends' children he liked to appear as a
benevolent great-uncle; when Mrs Thrale was
away from home, he would send her reports from
the nursery:

"I went this afternoon to visit the two babies at
Kensington, and found them indeed a little spotted
with their disorder, but as brisk and gay as health
[Pg 61]
and youth can make them. I took a paper of sweetmeats
and spread them on the table. They took
great delight to shew their governess the various
animals that were made of sugar; and when they
had eaten as much as was fit, the rest were laid up
for to-morrow."

Here is another letter written in his seventy-fifth
year       seven months before his death:

"To Miss Jane Langton.



May 10, 1784.

My Dearest Miss Jenny,

I am sorry that your pretty letter has
been so long without being answered; but, when
I am not pretty well, I do not always write plain
enough for young ladies. I am glad, my dear, to
see that you write so well, and hope that you mind
your pen, your book, and your needle, for they
are all necessary. Your books will give you knowledge,
and make you respected; and your needle
will find you useful employment when you do not
care to read. When you are a little older, I hope
you will be very diligent in learning arithmetick;
and, above all, that through your whole life you
will carefully say your prayers, and read your Bible.

I am, my dear, your most humble servant,
Sam. Johnson."


"He must have been a bold laugher," says Boswell
"who would have ventured to tell Dr Johnson
of any of his particularities."

But when a little girl asked him "Pray, Dr Johnson,
why do you make such strange gestures?"

[Pg 62]

"From bad habit" he replied. "Do you, my dear,
take care to guard against bad habits."

Had the questioner been some distinguished
man, the reply would more likely have been:
"Why, Sir, because I choose to, and there's an end
on't."

His Clubs


In spite of his oddities, Johnson was, before
everything, a social man. The great business
of his life, he said, was to escape from himself,
and he would never trust himself alone, "but when
employed in writing or reading." He would beg
a friend to go home with him simply to avoid being
alone in the coach.

"It was a very remarkable circumstance about
Johnson, whom shallow observers have supposed
to have been ignorant of the world, that very few
men had seen greater variety of characters....
The suddenness with which his accounts of some
of them started out in conversation, was not less
pleasing than surprising. I remember he once
observed to me, 'It is wonderful, Sir, what is to
be found in London. The most literary conversation
that I ever enjoyed, was at the table of
Jack Ellis, a money-scrivener behind the Royal
Exchange, with whom I at one period used to dine
generally once a week.'

[Pg 63]

Volumes would be required to contain a list of
his numerous and various acquaintance, none of
whom he ever forgot.... He associated with persons
the most widely different in manners, abilities, rank
and accomplishments. He was at once the companion
of the brilliant Colonel Forrester of the
Guards ... and of the aukward and uncouth Robert
Levet; of Lord Thurlow[16], and Mr Sastres, the
Italian master; and has dined one day with the
beautiful, gay, and fascinating Lady Craven, and
the next with good Mrs Gardiner, the tallow-chandler,
on Snow-hill."

In the company of "social friends" Johnson
found his greatest pleasure. His own definition of
a club was: "An assembly of good fellows, meeting
under certain conditions," and it is characteristic
of him that he was the inventor of the word clubable.

For, in Johnson's day, clubs were not luxurious
halls where conversation was carried on in undertones;
vigorous talking (with some eating and
drinking) was the chief object of the company that
gathered round the tavern table.

Of Johnson's talk we need not say much here.
It was, and is, his chief title to fame. In his lifetime
a roomful of people would wait in expectant
silence for him to begin; to-day his conversation
remains the chief attraction of Boswell's Life and
of the many other books, great and small, that
have been written about him.

Johnson looked upon conversation as a serious
art and said that a good talker should have knowledge,
[Pg 64]
command of words, imagination and a resolution
not to be overcome by failures. This last
he considered essential; and he certainly was not
often overcome himself, for he could not bear to
be worsted in argument, "even when he had taken
the wrong side." Hence his habit of "talking for
victory."

But Johnson could not talk his best if the dinner
had not been good. "For my part," he said in his
blunt way "I mind my belly very studiously, and
very carefully."

"I never knew any man" says Boswell "who
relished good eating more than he did. When at
table, he was totally absorbed in the business of the
moment; his looks seemed rivetted to his plate;
nor would he, unless when in very high company,
say one word, or even pay the least attention to
what was said by others, till he had satisfied his
appetite, which was so fierce, and indulged with
such intenseness, that while in the act of eating,
the veins of his forehead swelled, and generally a
strong perspiration was visible. To those whose
sensations were delicate, this could not but be disgusting....
It must be owned that Johnson, though
he could be rigidly abstemious, was not a temperate
man either in eating or drinking. He could refrain,
but he could not use moderately."

Johnson realised this well enough. So from 1736
to 1757 and for the last twenty years of his life he
drank no wine at all[17], except on special occasions.
Once or twice he persuaded Boswell also to be "a
water-drinker, upon trial"; but it is to be feared
[Pg 65]
that Boswell found it as hard to refrain as to use
moderately       he had many a morning headache.

Wine or no wine, Johnson saw no reason why
he should be abstemious over the tea-cups. In a
famous review of an Essay on Tea he described
himself as "a hardened and shameless tea-drinker,
who has for twenty years diluted his meals with
only the infusion of this fascinating plant; whose
kettle has scarcely time to cool; who with tea
amuses the evening, with tea solaces the midnight,
and with tea welcomes the morning."

After pouring out his sixteenth cup, a hostess
once asked him if a small basin would not save
him trouble. "'I wonder, Madam,' answered he
roughly, 'why all the ladies ask me such questions.
It is to save yourselves trouble, Madam,
and not me.' The lady was silent and resumed
her task."

Johnson founded his first club, as we have seen,
as a relief from his monotonous work on the
Dictionary. It was a small society which met once
a week at the King's Head, "a famous beef-steak
house" in Ivy Lane.

"Thither" wrote a member of the club "he
constantly resorted with a disposition to please and
be pleased. Our conversations seldom began till
after a supper so very solid and substantial as
led us to think that with him it was a dinner ...
his habitual melancholy and lassitude of spirit
gave way; his countenance brightened."

The Ivy Lane club broke up after about eight
years, but some months before his death Johnson
[Pg 66]
"had the pleasure of giving another dinner to the
remainder of the old club." "We were as cheerful,"
he wrote, "as in former times; only I could
not make quite so much noise."

Towards the end of his life, too, he formed the
Essex Head Club, of which "the terms were lax
and the expenses light." It had some distinguished
members and Boswell has preserved an interesting
set of rules as drafted by Johnson; but by far the
most famous of Johnson's clubs was the society
known as The Literary Club, founded in 1764.

"Sir Joshua Reynolds had the merit of being
the first proposer of it, to which Johnson acceded,
and the original members were, Sir Joshua Reynolds,
Dr Johnson, Mr Edmund Burke, Dr Nugent,
Mr Beauclerk, Mr Langton, Dr Goldsmith,
Mr Chamier, and Sir John Hawkins. They met
at the Turk's Head, in Gerrard-street, Soho, one
evening in every week, at seven, and generally
continued their conversation till a pretty late
hour. This club has been gradually increased to
its present number, thirty-five."

Johnson did not at first encourage an increase
in the number of members:

"Dr Goldsmith said once to Dr Johnson, that
he wished for some additional members to the
Literary Club, to give it an agreeable variety;
for (said he) there can now be nothing new among
us: we have travelled over one another's minds.
Johnson seemed a little angry, and said, 'Sir, you
have not travelled over my mind, I promise
you.'"

Boswell gives us a list of members in a later
[Pg 67]
year. In it we find the names of Adam Smith,
the political economist, Gibbon the historian,
Fox the politician, Sir Joseph Banks the explorer,
Sheridan the dramatist, Garrick the actor, and a
number of bishops, statesmen, doctors and lawyers       all
men of distinction; and over them all
towered the figure, and afterwards the memory,
of Samuel Johnson.

Boswell does not record many accounts of conversations
at the Club. Probably the rules did not
allow him to repeat much of what was said there.
But here are one or two extracts:

"Johnson. 'I have been reading Thicknesse's
Travels, which I think are entertaining.' Boswell.
'What, Sir, a good book?' Johnson. 'Yes, Sir, to
read once; I do not say you are to make a study
of it, and digest it; and I believe it to be a true
book in his intention. All travellers generally mean
to tell truth....'

"E.[18]
'From the experience which I have had,       and
I have had a great deal,       I have learnt to think
better of mankind.' Johnson.
'From my experience
I have found them worse in commercial
dealings, more disposed to cheat, than I had any
notion of; but more disposed to do one another
good than I had conceived ... and really it is wonderful,
considering how much attention is necessary
for men to take care of themselves, and ward
off immediate evils which press upon them, it is
wonderful how much they do for others. As it is
said of the greatest liar, that he tells more truth
than falsehood; so it may be said of the worst
[Pg 68]
man, that he does more good than evil.' Boswell.
'Perhaps from experience men may be found
happier than we suppose.' Johnson. 'No, Sir;
the more we enquire, we shall find men the less
happy....'

"Boswell. 'I have known a man resolved to
put friendship to the test, by asking a friend to
lend him money merely with that view, when he
did not want it.' Johnson. 'That is very wrong,
Sir. Your friend may be a narrow man, and yet
have many good qualities: narrowness may be his
only fault. Now you are trying his general character
as a friend, by one particular singly, in which
he happens to be defective, when, in truth, his
character is composed of many particulars.'"

"E. 'I understand the hogshead of claret,
which this society was favoured with by our
friend the Dean, is nearly out; I think he should
be written to, to send another of the same kind....'
Johnson. 'I am willing to offer my services as
secretary on this occasion.' P. 'As many as are
for Dr Johnson being secretary hold up your
hands.       Carried unanimously.' Boswell. 'He
will be our Dictator.' Johnson. 'No, the company
is to dictate to me....'"

Boswell seldom had the last word. At another
meeting of the Club:

"One of the company[19] attempted, with too
much forwardness, to rally him on his late appearance
at the theatre; but had reason to repent of
his temerity. 'Why, Sir, did you go to Mrs Abington's[20]
benefit? Did you see?' Johnson. 'No, Sir.'
[Pg 69]
'Did you hear?' Johnson. 'No, Sir.' 'Why then,
Sir, did you go?' Johnson. 'Because, Sir, she is a
favourite of the publick; and when the publick
cares the thousandth part for you that it does for
her, I will go to your benefit too.'"

It was on the day after this meeting that
Boswell tried, in vain, to solve the mystery of one
of Johnson's oddities:

"Next morning I won a small bet from Lady
Diana Beauclerk, by asking him as to one of his
particularities, which her Ladyship laid I durst not
do. It seems he had been frequently observed at
the Club to put into his pocket the Seville oranges,
after he had squeezed the juice of them into the
drink which he made for himself. Beauclerk and
Garrick talked of it to me, and seemed to think that
he had a strange unwillingness to be discovered.
We could not divine what he did with them; and
this was the bold question to be put. I saw on his
table the spoils of the preceding night, some fresh
peels nicely scraped and cut into pieces. 'O, Sir,
(said I) I now partly see what you do with the
squeezed oranges which you put into your pocket
at the Club.' Johnson. 'I have a great love for
them.' Boswell. 'And pray, Sir, what do you do
with them? You scrape them, it seems, very neatly,
and what next?' Johnson. 'Let them dry, Sir.'
Boswell. 'And what next?' Johnson. 'Nay, Sir,
you shall know their fate no further.' Boswell.
'Then the world must be left in the dark. It must
be said (assuming a mock solemnity,) he scraped
them, and let them dry, but what he did with them
next, he never could be prevailed upon to tell.'
[Pg 70]
Johnson. 'Nay, Sir, you should say it more emphatically:       he
could not be prevailed upon, even
by his dearest friends, to tell
[21].'"

Enter Boswell


Boswell and many others of Johnson's
friends have already entered so often into
the foregoing pages, that it is time we gave some
space to the more prominent members of
Johnson's circle.

James Boswell was more than thirty years
younger than Johnson, being born at Edinburgh
in 1740. He was the son of a Scottish judge, Lord
Auchinleck, and his own inclination was to be an
officer in the Guards; but at his father's wish he
entered the profession of the law, and studied, not
very industriously, first at Edinburgh and afterwards
at Glasgow University. He dabbled in
poetry and literary criticism and longed for the
gayer world and more cultured society of London.
He first visited the capital in 1760 and on his
second visit fulfilled what was then the greatest
ambition of his life       he met Dr Johnson.


  
  James Boswell
  

Boswell's account of this meeting has become
one of the most famous passages in English literature
and part of it, at any rate, must be repeated
here:

[Pg 71]

"Mr Thomas Davies the actor, who then kept
a bookseller's shop in Russel-street, Covent-garden,
told me that Johnson was very much his
friend, and came frequently to his house, where he
more than once invited me to meet him; but by
some unlucky accident or other he was prevented
from coming to us. Mr Thomas Davies was a man
of good understanding and talents, with the advantage
of a liberal education.... [He] recollected
several of Johnson's remarkable sayings, and was
one of the best of the many imitators of his voice
and manner, while relating them. He increased
my impatience more and more to see the extraordinary
man whose works I highly valued, and
whose conversation was reported to be so peculiarly
excellent. At last, on Monday the 16th of
May [1763], when I was sitting in Mr Davies's
back-parlour, after having drunk tea with him and
Mrs Davies, Johnson unexpectedly came into
the shop; and Mr Davies having perceived him
through the glass-door in the room in which
we were sitting, advancing towards us,       he announced
his aweful approach to me, somewhat in
the manner of an actor in the part of Horatio,
when he addresses Hamlet on the appearance of
his father's ghost, 'Look, my Lord, it comes.' I
found that I had a very perfect idea of Johnson's
figure, from the portrait of him painted by Sir
Joshua Reynolds soon after he had published his
Dictionary, in the attitude of sitting in his easy
chair in deep meditation, which was the first picture
his friend did for him.... Mr Davies mentioned
my name, and respectfully introduced me
[Pg 72]
to him. I was much agitated; and recollecting
his prejudice against the Scotch, of which I had
heard much, I said to Davies, 'Don't tell where I
come from.'       'From Scotland,' cried Davies roguishly.
'Mr Johnson, (said I) I do indeed come
from Scotland, but I cannot help it.' I am willing
to flatter myself that I meant this as light pleasantry
to sooth and conciliate him, and not as an
humiliating abasement at the expence of my country.
But however that might be, this speech was
somewhat unlucky; for with that quickness of wit
for which he was so remarkable, he seized the
expression 'come from Scotland,' which I used in
the sense of being of that country; and, as if I had
said that I had come away from it, or left it, retorted,
'That, Sir, I find, is what a very great many
of your countrymen cannot help.' This stroke
stunned me a good deal; and when we had sat down,
I felt myself not a little embarrassed, and apprehensive
of what might come next. He then addressed
himself to Davies: 'What do you think
of Garrick? He has refused me an order for the
play for Miss Williams, because he knows the
house will be full, and that an order would be worth
three shillings.' Eager to take any opening to get
into conversation with him, I ventured to say, 'O,
Sir, I cannot think Mr Garrick would grudge such
a trifle to you.' 'Sir (said he, with a stern look,) I
have known David Garrick longer than you have
done: and I know no right you have to talk to
me on the subject.' Perhaps I deserved this check;
for it was rather presumptuous in me, an entire
stranger, to express any doubt of the justice of
[Pg 73]
his animadversion upon his old acquaintance and
pupil. I now felt myself much mortified, and began
to think that the hope which I had long indulged
of obtaining his acquaintance was blasted.
And, in truth, had not my ardour been uncommonly
strong, and my resolution uncommonly persevering,
so rough a reception might have deterred
me for ever from making any further attempts.
Fortunately, however, I remained upon the field
not wholly discomfited; and was soon rewarded
by hearing some of his conversation...."

Before the end of the interview Boswell recovered
a little from his nervousness; but, as he
was going, complained to Davies of the hard blows
the great man had given him. Davies, who had
no doubt enjoyed the evening with considerable
relish, cheered him by saying "Don't be uneasy.
I can see he likes you very well."

A few days later Boswell made a further venture.
He "boldly repaired" to Johnson's chambers on
the first floor on No. 1 Inner-Temple-lane.

"He received me very courteously; but it must
be confessed, that his apartment, and furniture,
and morning dress, were sufficiently uncouth. His
brown suit of cloaths looked very rusty; he had on
a little old shrivelled unpowdered wig, which was
too small for his head; his shirt-neck and knees of
his breeches were loose; his black worsted stockings
ill drawn up; and he had a pair of unbuckled
shoes by way of slippers. But all these slovenly
particularities were forgotten the moment that he
began to talk. Some gentlemen, whom I do not
recollect, were sitting with him; and when they
[Pg 74]
went away, I also rose; but he said to me, 'Nay,
don't go.' 'Sir (said I,) I am afraid that I intrude
upon you. It is benevolent to allow me to sit and
hear you.' He seemed pleased with this compliment,
which I sincerely paid him, and answered,
'Sir, I am obliged to any man who visits me.'"

He soon reached a further stage of intimacy:

"I had learnt that his place of frequent resort was
the Mitre tavern in Fleet-street, where he loved
to sit up late, and I begged I might be allowed to
pass an evening with him there soon, which he promised
I should. A few days afterwards I met him
near Temple-bar, about one o'clock in the morning,
and asked him if he would then go to the
Mitre. 'Sir, (said he) it is too late; they won't let
us in. But I'll go with you another night with all
my heart.'"

There is only one way to follow the progress of
this friendship       and that is to read Boswell's own
story of it.

Boswell did not get on very happily with his
father and, whenever he could, left his Ayrshire
home for London; and in London his chief delight
was to be with Johnson. They often travelled
together and in a later chapter we shall read some
account of their journeys, especially of Johnson's
visit to Scotland, about which each of them wrote
a book.

Here we will be content with a few typical
incidents and conversations in the long friendship.

Johnson could not have found a better listener
than "Bozzy," as he soon began to call him. Boswell's
[Pg 75]
worship of his hero may often seem to us
absurd, but we may be sure that Johnson would
never have tolerated, much less loved, a man
who was simply a flatterer.

Boswell was really interested in the things Johnson
talked about and, without any pretence, enjoyed
the same kind of pleasures       dining out, arguing
over a good bottle of port, staying at friends'
houses, examining cathedrals, wandering up and
down Fleet Street, coming down late to breakfast.
"No man," as Johnson said, "is a hypocrite in his
pleasures."

Moreover, Johnson "loved the acquaintance
of young people."

"Sir," he said "young men have more virtue
than old men; they have more generous sentiments
in every respect. I love the young dogs of
this age: they have more wit and humour and
knowledge of life than we had; but then the dogs
are not so good scholars."

Boswell was certainly "a young dog"; and even
the fact that he came from Scotland must have
been a source of pleasure to Johnson, who, when
he had no other retort ready, could always bring
out the old joke in a new form.

Above all, Boswell was clubable; and Johnson
could give no higher praise.

But we must return to the Mitre, where Boswell
is now a proud host:

"I had as my guests this evening at the Mitre
tavern, Dr Johnson, Dr Goldsmith, Mr Thomas
Davies, Mr Eccles ... and the Reverend Mr John
Ogilvie, who was desirous of being in company
[Pg 76]
with my illustrious friend, while I, in my turn,
was proud to have the honour of shewing one of
my countrymen upon what easy terms Johnson
permitted me to live with him.... Mr Ogilvie was
unlucky enough to choose for the topick of his
conversation the praises of his native country. He
began with saying, that there was very rich land
round Edinburgh. Goldsmith, who had studied
physick there, contradicted this, very untruly,
with a sneering laugh. Disconcerted a little by
this, Mr Ogilvie then took new ground, where, I
suppose, he thought himself perfectly safe; for he
observed, that Scotland had a great many noble
wild prospects. Johnson. 'I believe, Sir, you have
a great many. Norway, too, has noble wild prospects;
and Lapland is remarkable for prodigious
noble wild prospects. But, Sir, let me tell you,
the noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees,
is the high road that leads him to England!'"

The friendship ripened quickly. When Boswell
announced that he would shortly be going to
Utrecht to continue his study of the law, Johnson
said, "I must see thee out of England; I will accompany
you to Harwich." Boswell "could not
find words to express what he felt upon this unexpected
and very great mark of his affectionate
regard."

When the time came, he was loth to go:

"After tea he carried me to what he called his
walk, which was a long narrow paved court in the
neighbourhood, overshadowed by some trees.
There we sauntered a considerable time; and I
complained to him that my love of London and
[Pg 77]
of his company was such, that I shrunk almost
from the thought of going away, even to travel,
which is generally so much desired by young men.
He roused me by manly and spirited conversation.
He advised me, when settled in any place abroad,
to study with an eagerness after knowledge and
to apply to Greek an hour every day; and when
I was moving about, to read diligently the great
book of mankind."

On the way to Harwich Johnson was more
jocular. In the stage coach "a fat elderly gentlewoman,
and a young Dutchman seemed the most
inclined among us to conversation. At the inn
where we dined, the gentlewoman said that she
had done her best to educate her children; and
particularly that she had never suffered them to be
a moment idle. Johnson. 'I wish, Madam, you
would educate me too; for I have been an idle
fellow all my life.' 'I am sure, Sir, (said she) you
have not been idle.' Johnson. 'Nay, Madam, it
is very true; and that gentleman there (pointing
to me,) has been idle. He was idle at Edinburgh.
His father sent him to Glasgow, where he continued
to be idle. He then came to London,
where he has been very idle; and now he is going
to Utrecht, where he will be as idle as ever.'
I asked him privately how he could expose me so.
Johnson. 'Poh, poh! (said he) they knew nothing
about you, and will think of it no more.'"

The first meeting between these two men had
taken place in May 1763. Boswell left for Utrecht
in the August of the same year. His description
of his farewell to Johnson at Harwich shews how
[Pg 78]
firmly their friendship had been formed in a few
months:

"My revered friend walked down with me to
the beach, where we embraced and parted with tenderness,
and engaged to correspond by letters. I
said, 'I hope, Sir, you will not forget me in my
absence.' Johnson. 'Nay, Sir, it is more likely you
should forget me, than that I should forget you.'
As the vessel put out to sea, I kept my eyes upon
him for a considerable time, while he remained rolling
his majestick frame in his usual manner: and
at last I perceived him walk back into the town,
and he disappeared."




More about Boswell


Boswell travelled a good deal and visited
several European countries besides Holland.
He took a special interest in Corsica and afterwards
wrote a book about the people of the island.
Johnson was at first discouraging on this subject
and wished Boswell would empty his head of it,
but he afterwards highly praised his Journal.

On his return to London, Boswell found that
his admiration of his hero's "extraordinary mind"
was "increased and confirmed," and when, a few
years later, he was about to be married, he promised
himself a great deal of instructive conversation
with Johnson "on the conduct of the married
[Pg 79]
state," but Johnson (who said once that marriages
in general would be as happy, and often more so,
if they were all made by the Lord Chancellor) "did
not say much upon that topick."

When Johnson went to stay with his friend in
Scotland, Mrs Boswell found his visit quite long
enough:

"The truth is, that his irregular hours and uncouth
habits, such as turning the candles with their
heads downwards, when they did not burn bright
enough, and letting the wax drop upon the carpet,
could not but be disagreeable to a lady. Besides,
she had not that high admiration of him which was
felt by most of those who knew him; and what
was very natural to a female mind, she thought
he had too much influence over her husband. She
once in a little warmth, made, with more point
than justice, this remark upon that subject: 'I
have seen many a bear led by a man; but I never
before saw a man led by a bear.'"

It is delightful to note Boswell's pride as each
fresh link is formed in the chain of friendship.
Johnson, as we have seen, was a devout Christian
and encouraged his friend to join him in his devotions:

"On the 9th of April [1773], being Good Friday,
I breakfasted with him on tea and cross-buns;
Doctor Levet, as Frank called him, making the tea.
He carried me with him to the Church of St Clement
Danes, where he had his seat; and his behaviour
was, as I had imaged to myself, solemnly
devout. I never shall forget the tremulous
earnestness with which he pronounced the awful
[Pg 80]
petition in the Litany: 'In the hour of death, and
at the day of judgement, good Lord deliver us.'
We went to church both in the morning and
evening. In the interval between the two services
we did not dine; but he read in the Greek New
Testament, and I turned over several of his books."

Two days later he had his first dinner at Johnson's
house:

"I had ... great curiosity to dine with Dr Samuel
Johnson, in the dusky recess of a court in Fleet-street.
I supposed we should scarcely have knives
and forks, and only some strange, uncouth, ill-drest
dish: but I found every thing in very good order.
We had no other company but Mrs Williams and
a young woman whom I did not know. As a dinner
here was considered as a singular phænomenon,
and as I was frequently interrogated on the subject,
my readers may perhaps be desirous to know
our bill of fare.... We had a very good soup, a
boiled leg of lamb and spinach, a veal pye, and a
rice pudding."

Boswell was made still prouder when shortly
afterwards he was admitted to the Club:

"On Friday, April 30, I dined with him at Mr
Beauclerk's, where were Lord Charlemont, Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and some more members of the
Literary Club, whom he had obligingly invited
to meet me, as I was this evening to be balloted
for as candidate for admission into that distinguished
society. Johnson had done me the honour
to propose me, and Beauclerk was very zealous
for me...."

"The gentlemen went away to their club, and I
[Pg 81]
was left at Beauclerk's till the fate of my election
should be announced to me. I sat in a state of
anxiety which even the charming conversation of
Lady Di Beauclerk could not entirely dissipate.
In a short time I received the agreeable intelligence
that I was chosen. I hastened to the place
of meeting, and was introduced to such a society as
can seldom be found.... Upon my entrance, Johnson
placed himself behind a chair, on which he
leaned as on a desk or pulpit, and with humorous
formality gave me a Charge, pointing out the conduct
expected from me as a good member of this
club."

When they were travelling together in Scotland
Johnson frankly told him a little more about the
election, and Boswell as frankly tells us:

"He told me, 'Sir, you got into our club by
doing what a man can do. Several of the members
wished to keep you out. Burke told me, he
doubted if you were fit for it: but, now you are in,
none of them are sorry. Burke says, that you have
so much good humour naturally, it is scarce a virtue.'
Boswell. 'They were afraid of you, Sir, as
it was you who proposed me.' Johnson. 'Sir, they
knew, that if they refused you, they'd probably
never have got in another. I'd have kept them all
out.'"

Perhaps the boldest thing Boswell did in the
course of his friendship with Johnson was to arrange
a meeting between him and John Wilkes.
The story of Wilkes belongs to the history-books.
Himself a member of parliament, he had in 1763
violently attacked the king and his minister, Lord
[Pg 82]
Bute, in a famous issue of The North Briton. For
this he was imprisoned in the Tower and expelled
from the House of Commons. But outside
Parliament there was much sympathy with him,
especially in London, and he quickly became a
popular hero. "Wilkes and Liberty for ever" was
the cry. He was three times re-elected as member
for Middlesex, but each time Parliament refused
to let him take his seat. Finally, after being made
Lord Mayor of London in 1774, he had a great
triumph in the House of Commons in the following
year, when all the previous resolutions against
him were annulled.

It is not difficult to imagine how Dr Johnson,
with his principles of loyalty to king and government,
felt towards this hero of popular liberty.

Boswell realised this quite well:

"My desire of being acquainted with celebrated
men of every description, had made me, much
about the same time, obtain an introduction to Dr
Samuel Johnson and to John Wilkes, Esq. Two
men more different could perhaps not be selected
out of all mankind. They had even attacked one
another with some asperity in their writings; yet
I lived in habits of friendship with both. I could
fully relish the excellence of each.... I conceived
an irresistible wish, if possible, to bring Dr Johnson
and Mr Wilkes together. How to manage
it, was a nice and difficult matter."

Boswell went tactfully to work. After getting
Johnson's consent to dine at Mr Dilly's, he hinted
at strange company:

"'Provided, Sir, I suppose, that the company
[Pg 83]
which he is to have, is agreeable to you.' Johnson.
'What do you mean, Sir? What do you take
me for? Do you think I am so ignorant of the
world, as to imagine that I am to prescribe to a
gentleman what company he is to have at his table?'
Boswell. 'I beg your pardon, Sir ... I should not
be surprized to find Jack Wilkes there.' Johnson.
'And if Jack Wilkes should be there, what is that
to me, Sir?'"

"Upon the much-expected Wednesday, I called
on him about half an hour before dinner, as I
often did when we were to dine out together, to
see that he was ready in time, and to accompany
him. I found him buffeting his books, as upon a
former occasion, covered with dust, and making
no preparation for going abroad. 'How is this, Sir?
(said I.) Don't you recollect that you are to dine
at Mr Dilly's?' Johnson. 'Sir, I did not think of
going to Dilly's: it went out of my head. I have
ordered dinner at home with Mrs Williams.' Boswell.
'But, my dear Sir, you know you were engaged
to Mr Dilly, and I told him so. He will
expect you, and will be much disappointed if you
don't come.' Johnson. 'You must talk to Mrs
Williams about this.'"

Here, as Boswell says, was a sad dilemma. There
was nothing for it but to approach Mrs Williams.
She was difficult at first, but "gradually softened"
and finally gave her consent that the Doctor
should go.

"I flew back to him, still in dust, and careless
of what should be the event, 'indifferent in his
choice to go or stay'; but as soon as I had
[Pg 84]
announced to him Mrs Williams' consent,
he roared 'Frank, a clean shirt,' and was very
soon drest. When I had him fairly seated in a
hackney-coach with me, I exulted as much as a
fortune-hunter who has got an heiress into a post-chaise
with him to set out for Gretna-Green.
When we entered Mr Dilly's drawing-room, he
found himself in the midst of a company he
did not know.... 'And who is the gentleman in
lace?'       'Mr Wilkes, Sir.' This information confounded
him still more; he had some difficulty to
restrain himself, and taking up a book, sat down
upon a window-seat and read, or at least kept his
eye upon it intently for some time, till he composed
himself...."

"The cheering sound of 'Dinner is upon the
table,' dissolved his reverie, and we all sat down
without any symptom of ill humour.... Mr Wilkes
placed himself next to Dr Johnson, and behaved
to him with so much attention and politeness, that
he gained upon him insensibly. No man eat more
heartily than Johnson, or loved better what was
nice and delicate. Mr Wilkes was very assiduous
in helping him to some fine veal. 'Pray give me
leave, Sir:       It is better here       A little of the
brown       Some fat, Sir       A little of the stuffing       Some
gravy       Let me have the pleasure of giving
you some butter       Allow me to recommend a
squeeze of this orange;       or the lemon, perhaps,
may have more zest.'       'Sir, Sir, I am obliged to
you, Sir,' cried Johnson, bowing, and turning his
head to him...."

The good fare provided by Mr Dilly and the tact
[Pg 85]
of John Wilkes himself soon made things easier.
Johnson was before long talking in his usual domineering
way about poets and players, and eventually
he and Wilkes found at least one "bond of
union"       a common prejudice against Scotland.
So they "amused themselves with persevering in
the old jokes."

"Johnson (to Mr Wilkes). 'You must know,
Sir, I lately took my friend Boswell and shewed
him genuine civilised life in an English provincial
town. I turned him loose at Lichfield, my native
city, that he might see for once real civility: for
you know he lives among savages in Scotland, and
among rakes in London.' Wilkes. 'Except when
he is with grave, sober, decent people like you
and me.' Johnson (smiling). 'And we ashamed
of him.'"

Boswell did not mind this kind of chaff. He was
too pleased with his "successful negociation."

Once or twice Johnson went too far, even for
Boswell's humble devotion:

"On Saturday, May 2, [1778] I dined with
him at Sir Joshua Reynolds's, where there was a
very large company ... less attention was paid to
him than usual, which put him out of humour;
and upon some imaginary offence from me, he
attacked me with such rudeness, that I was vexed
and angry.... I was so much hurt, and had my
pride so much roused, that I kept away from him
for a week...."

"On Friday, May 8, I dined with him at Mr
Langton's. I was reserved and silent, which I suppose
he perceived, and might recollect the cause.
[Pg 86]
After dinner when ... we were by ourselves, he
drew his chair near to mine, and said, in a tone
of conciliating courtesy, 'Well, how have you
done?' Boswell. 'Sir, you have made me very
uneasy by your behaviour to me when we were
last at Sir Joshua Reynolds's. You know, my dear
Sir, no man has a greater respect and affection for
you, or would sooner go to the end of the world
to serve you. Now to treat me so       .' He insisted
that I had interrupted him, which I assured him
was not the case; and proceeded       'But why treat
me so before people who neither love you nor
me?' Johnson. 'Well, I am sorry for it. I'll make
it up to you twenty different ways, as you please.'
Boswell. 'I said to-day to Sir Joshua, when he
observed that you tossed me sometimes       I don't
care how often, or how high he tosses me, when
only friends are present, for then I fall upon soft
ground: but I do not like falling on stones, which
is the case when enemies are present.'"

But these tiffs were rare. "My regard for you"
Johnson told Boswell with a sincerity we cannot
doubt "is greater almost than I have words to express;
but I do not choose to be always repeating
it."

He did so, however, in many a letter to his
friend:

"My dear Boswell," he wrote "do not neglect
to write to me; for your kindness is one of the
pleasures of my life, which I should be sorry to
lose."

Boswell's reply was no less sincere:

"Be assured, my dear Sir, that my affection and
[Pg 87]
reverence for you are exalted and steady. I do
not believe that a more perfect attachment ever
existed in the history of mankind."




David Garrick


Except for the part he played in Johnson's
Irene, we have heard little of David Garrick
since he came to London in 1737 "with three-halfpence
in his pocket."

He at first entered Lincoln's Inn to study the
law, but he had a passion for the stage and made
his first appearance in the part of a harlequin.
Unlike Johnson, he did not have to face a long
period of poverty and 'cold obscurity'; he received
a legacy of £1000 and before he had spent
it all, his acting of the part of Richard III in 1741
quickly made him famous.

Mr Pope declared: "That young man never
had his equal as an actor and he never will have
a rival," and there were "a dozen dukes of a
night" at the theatre in Goodman's Fields.

He made large sums of money and in a few
years' time became manager of Drury Lane
theatre, where he tried hard, but in vain, to make
Johnson's tragedy a success.

In the bitterness of his early struggle Johnson
was no doubt a little jealous of his old pupil.

[Pg 88]

"His being outstripped by his pupil" says
Boswell "in the race of immediate fame, as well as
of fortune, probably made him feel some indignation,
as thinking that whatever might be Garrick's
merits in his art, the reward was too great when
compared with what the most successful efforts
of literary labour could attain.... His schoolfellow
and friend, Dr Taylor, told me a pleasant anecdote
of Johnson's triumphing over his pupil David Garrick.
When that great actor had played some little
time at Goodman's fields, Johnson and Taylor
went to see him perform, and afterwards passed
the evening at a tavern with him and old Giffard[22].
Johnson ... after censuring some mistakes in emphasis
which Garrick had committed in the course
of that night's acting, said, 'the players, Sir, have
got a kind of rant, with which they run on, without
any regard to accent or emphasis.' Both Garrick
and Giffard were offended at this sarcasm, and
endeavoured to refute it; upon which Johnson
rejoined, 'Well now, I'll give you something to
speak, with which you are little acquainted, and
then we shall see how just my observation is. That
shall be the criterion. Let me hear you repeat the
ninth Commandment, "Thou shalt not bear false
witness against thy neighbour."' Both tried at it,
said Dr Taylor, and both mistook the emphasis,
which should be upon not and false witness. Johnson
put them right, and enjoyed his victory with
great glee."

  Drury Lane Theatre
  

Whether Johnson was right or not may still be
argued, but he loved to get Davy back at school
[Pg 89]
again. Garrick, too, retained some of his school-boy
tricks of mimicry:

"He could imitate Johnson very exactly.... I
recollect his exhibiting him to me one day, as if
saying, 'Davy has some convivial pleasantry about
him, but 'tis a futile fellow;' which he uttered
perfectly with the tone and air of Johnson."

Johnson's provincial accent (he pronounced
once as woonse) gave Garrick another opening:

"Garrick sometimes used to take him off,
squeezing a lemon into a punch-bowl, with uncouth
gesticulations, looking round the company,
and calling out, 'Who's for poonsh?'"

Johnson, for his part, never quite got rid of his
feeling of contempt for the actor's profession. He
often discussed it with Boswell:

"Boswell. 'Sir ..., you never will allow merit
to a player.' Johnson. 'Merit, Sir! what merit?
Do you respect a rope-dancer, or a ballad-singer?'
Boswell. 'No, Sir: but we respect a great player,
as a man who can conceive lofty sentiments and
can express them gracefully.' Johnson. 'What,
Sir, a fellow who claps a hump on his back, and
a lump on his leg, and cries "I am Richard the
Third?"' ... Boswell. 'My dear Sir! you may turn
anything into ridicule ... a great player does what
very few are capable to do: his art is a very rare
faculty. Who can repeat Hamlet's soliloquy, "To
be, or not to be," as Garrick does it?' Johnson.
'Anybody may. Jemmy, there (a boy about eight
years old, who was in the room), will do it as well
in a week.' Boswell. 'No, no, Sir: and as a proof
of the merit of great acting, and of the value which
[Pg 90]
mankind set upon it, Garrick has got a hundred
thousand pounds.' Johnson. 'Is getting a hundred
thousand pounds a proof of excellence? That
has been done by a scoundrel commissary.'"

Poor Bozzy! "I was sure, for once," he says,
"that I had the best side of the argument." As if
that made any difference to Johnson when he was
"talking for victory"!

Both Garrick and Johnson were lovers of books       but
in a different way. Johnson was "born to
grapple with whole libraries," as Boswell's uncle
said, but he did not treat a rare volume with the
tender care of a collector. When he was putting
his books in order, he wore a pair of large gloves
"such as hedgers use," and "buffeted" them so
that clouds of dust flew round him. When he was
reading a new book it was said that "he tore out
the heart of it"; when he was tidying his old ones
it is to be feared that he sometimes tore off the
covers of them. Garrick had some old and valued
editions, and seems to have offended Johnson by
hesitating to lend them to him. Even Boswell
admits that "considering the slovenly and careless
manner in which books were treated by
Johnson, it could not be expected that scarce
and valuable editions should have been lent to
him."

Garrick, moreover, had learnt by experience.
Here is the story as he told it to Miss Burney:

"'David!' said Johnson, 'will you lend me
your Petrarca
[23]?' 'Y-e-s, Sir!' 'David! you sigh?'
[Pg 91]
'Sir       you shall have it certainly.' Accordingly the
book, stupendously bound, I sent to him that very
evening. But scarcely had he taken it in his hands,
when, as Boswell tells me, he poured forth a Greek
ejaculation and a couplet or two from Horace,
and then in one of those fits of enthusiasm which
always seem to require that he should spread his
arms aloft, he suddenly pounces my poor Petrarca
over his head upon the floor. And then, standing
for several minutes lost in abstraction, he forgot
probably that he had ever seen it."

As his old schoolmaster, Johnson took good
care that Garrick should not suffer from swelled
head:

"Not very long after the institution of our club,
Sir Joshua Reynolds was speaking of it to Garrick.
'I like it much, (said he,) I think I shall be
of you.' When Sir Joshua mentioned this to Dr
Johnson, he was much displeased with the actor's
conceit. 'He'll be of us, (said Johnson) how does
he know we will permit him? The first Duke in
England has no right to hold such language.'
However, when Garrick was regularly proposed
some time afterwards, Johnson, though he had
taken a momentary offence at his arrogance, warmly
and kindly supported him, and he was accordingly
elected, was a most agreeable member, and
continued to attend our meetings to the time of
his death."

Each of them, indeed, was ready to help the
other when he could. When the advertisement of
Johnson's Dictionary appeared in The Gentleman's
Magazine, there was printed beneath it a complimentary
[Pg 92]
ode, written by Garrick, and ending with
the lines:


And Johnson, well arm'd like a hero of yore,
Has beat forty French, and will beat forty more![24]


When Drury Lane theatre was first opened
under the management of Garrick, the prologue
(one of the two decent prologues in the language,
according to Byron) was written by Johnson. It
is a fine appeal to the public to support Garrick
in ennobling the stage by the revival of Shakespeare:


Ah! let not censure term our fate our choice,
The stage but echoes back the public voice;
The drama's laws, the drama's patrons give,
For we that live to please, must please to live.


The truth was, as Sir Joshua Reynolds said:

"Johnson considered Garrick to be as it were
his property. He would allow no man either to
blame or to praise Garrick in his presence, without
contradicting him."

Boswell discovered this, as we have seen, at the
famous meeting in Tom Davies's back parlour.

Garrick died in 1779 and was buried with great
pomp in Westminster Abbey. His death provoked
one of the most famous of all Johnson's sentences:

"That stroke of death" he wrote, "has eclipsed
the gaiety of nations."



  
  David Garrick
  

Of his personal character Johnson said even
finer things and when Boswell tried to press him,
he retired, as usual, defeated:

[Pg 93]

"Johnson. 'Garrick was a very good man, the
cheerfullest man of his age; a decent liver in a
profession which is supposed to give indulgence
to licentiousness; and a man who gave away,
freely, money acquired by himself. He began the
world with a great hunger for money; the son of
a half-pay officer, bred in a family, whose study
was to make four-pence do as much as others
made four-pence halfpenny do. But, when he had
got money, he was very liberal....'

[Boswell] 'You say, Sir, his death eclipsed the
gaiety of nations.' Johnson. 'I could not have said
more nor less. It is the truth; eclipsed, not extinguished;
and his death did eclipse; it was like
a storm.' Boswell. 'But why nations? Did his
gaiety extend farther than his own nation?' Johnson.
'Why, Sir, some exaggeration must be allowed.
Besides, nations may be said       if we allow
the Scotch to be a nation, and to have gaiety,       which
they have not. You are an exception, though.
Come, gentlemen, let us candidly admit that there
is one Scotchman who is cheerful.' Beauclerk.
'But he is a very unnatural Scotchman.'"

Oliver Goldsmith once wrote a series of playful
epitaphs for his friends. These were his first two
lines on Garrick:


Here lies David Garrick, describe him who can,
An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man.

Oliver Goldsmith


Oliver Goldsmith, known best to us
as the author of The Vicar of Wakefield, and
described by Boswell as "one of the brightest
ornaments of the Johnsonian school" was, like his
master, an adventurer in literature.

The son of a poor Irish clergyman, he went, after
an unhappy time at school, where he was teased by
the boys on account of his disfigurement by small
pox, to Trinity College, Dublin.

Here, like Johnson at Oxford, he was a "lounger
at the college-gate" and, in spite of his poverty,
a leading spirit in college riots, such as the ducking
of a bailiff and the gathering of a dancing party
"of humblest sort" in his college room.

However, he worked hard enough to get the
degree of Bachelor of Arts, and learnt, besides, to
write ballads and to play the flute. After three
years of idleness he went to Edinburgh to study
medicine, the money being provided by a generous
uncle. But more of this bounty was spent on fine
clothes than on medical books and his restlessness
soon drove him abroad to the university of
Leyden, where he studied little except in what
Johnson calls "the great book of mankind."

With the true spirit of the Irish adventurer he
now began his wanderings on foot through Flanders,
France, Switzerland and Italy. Sometimes
[Pg 95]
he had to depend on the tunes of his flute to get
him food and lodging; sometimes he earned a few
shillings "by demanding at Universities to enter
the lists as a disputant." Having thus disputed his
passage through Europe, as Boswell says, he landed
in England at the age of 28 without a shilling in
his pocket.

For him, as for Johnson, there was only one
kind of life possible       the life of "Grub Street."
Here are a few lines from his own Description of
an Author's Bedchamber:


The morn was cold, he views with keen desire
The rusty grate unconscious of a fire:
With beer and milk arrears the frieze was scored,
And five crack'd teacups dress'd the chimney board:
A nightcap deck'd his brows instead of bay,
A cap by night       a stocking all the day!


In his early years in London he was, as Boswell
tells us, "employed successively in the capacities
of an usher to an academy, a corrector of the press,
a reviewer, and a writer for a news-paper. He had
sagacity enough to cultivate assiduously the acquaintance
of Johnson.... To me and many others
it appeared that he studiously copied the manner
of Johnson, though, indeed, upon a smaller scale.
At this time I think he had published nothing
with his name, though it was pretty generally
known that one Dr Goldsmith was the authour of
An Enquiry into the present State of polite Learning
in Europe, and of The Citizen of the World, a series
of letters supposed to be written from London by
a Chinese."

Johnson paid his first visit to Goldsmith in
[Pg 96]
1761. Dr Percy, a friend of both, gave this account
of it:

"The first visit Goldsmith ever received from
Johnson was on May 31, 1761, when he gave an
invitation to him, and much other company, many
of them literary men, to a supper in his lodgings
in Wine Office Court, Fleet Street. Percy being
intimate with Johnson, was desired to call upon
him and take him with him. As they went together
the former was much struck with the
studied neatness of Johnson's dress. He had on a
new suit of clothes, a new wig nicely powdered,
and everything about him so perfectly dissimilar
from his usual appearance that his companion
could not help inquiring the cause of this singular
transformation. 'Why, Sir,' said Johnson, 'I hear
that Goldsmith, who is a very great sloven,
justifies his disregard of cleanliness and decency
by quoting my practice, and I am desirous this
night to show him a better example.'"

Johnson quickly took Goldsmith to his heart,
and praised his writing at a time when the public
"made a point to know nothing about it."

Goldsmith was an original member of the Literary
Club and, rather to Boswell's chagrin, soon
became a real intimate of Johnson's household:

"My next meeting with Johnson," says Boswell,
"was on Friday the 1st of July, [1763] when
he and I and Dr Goldsmith supped together at
the Mitre.... Goldsmith's respectful attachment to
Johnson was then at its height; for his own literary
reputation had not yet distinguished him so much
as to excite a vain desire of competition with his
[Pg 97]
great Master. He had increased my admiration of
the goodness of Johnson's heart, by incidental remarks
in the course of conversation, such as ...
when I wondered that he was very kind to a man
of whom I had heard a very bad character, 'He
is now become miserable, and that insures the
protection of Johnson....'"


  
  Oliver Goldsmith
  

"At this time Miss Williams, as she was then
called ... had so much of his attention, that he
every night drank tea with her before he went
home, however late it might be.... Dr Goldsmith,
being a privileged man, went with him this night,
strutting away, and calling to me with an air of
superiority ... 'I go to Miss Williams.' I confess,
I then envied him this mighty privilege, of which
he seemed so proud; but it was not long before I
obtained the same mark of distinction[25]."

Goldsmith, indeed, was sometimes rather bitter
about Boswell.

"Who is this Scotch cur at Johnson's heels?"
asked someone. "He is not a cur," answered Goldsmith,
"you are too severe. He is only a bur. Tom
Davies flung him at Johnson in sport, and he has
the faculty of sticking."

The Traveller, published in 1764, at length
brought Goldsmith fame, though not a fortune.
He received but twenty guineas for it and was
still miserable enough to qualify for Johnson's
protection.

"I received one morning," so Johnson told Boswell,
"a message from poor Goldsmith that he was
in great distress, and as it was not in his power to
[Pg 98]
come to me, begging that I would come to him
as soon as possible. I sent him a guinea, and promised
to come to him directly. I accordingly went
as soon as I was drest, and found that his landlady
had arrested him for his rent, at which he was in
a violent passion. I perceived that he had already
changed my guinea, and had got a bottle of Madeira
and a glass before him. I put the cork into the
bottle, desired he would be calm, and began to talk
to him of the means by which he might be extricated.
He then told me that he had a novel ready
for the press, which he produced to me. I looked
into it, and saw its merit; told the landlady I should
soon return, and having gone to a bookseller,
sold it for sixty pounds. I brought Goldsmith the
money, and he discharged his rent, not without rating
his landlady in a high tone for having used
him so ill."

The novel ready for the press was The Vicar of
Wakefield.

This is not the place for a full account of Goldsmith's
works; but we will glance at one or two.

The picture of English country life in The Deserted
Village still delights us. Here, for instance,
are a few lines on the village schoolmaster:


There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,
The village master taught his little school:
A man severe he was, and stern to view,
I knew him well, and every truant knew;
Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace
The day's disasters in his morning face;
Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee
At all his jokes, for many a joke had he.


[Pg 99]

As a writer of plays, Goldsmith gained a great
success with She Stoops to Conquer. Johnson, to
whom it was dedicated, said:

"I know of no comedy for many years that has
so much exhilarated an audience, that has answered
so much the great end of comedy       making an
audience merry."

Goldsmith wrote histories of England, Greece,
and Rome       sometimes inaccurate, but always
readable, and, with but a shallow knowledge of
natural science, plunged into a work called A History
of the Earth and Animated Nature. He had, as
Boswell says, "a more than common share of that
hurry of ideas which we often find in his countrymen."

"Goldsmith told us, that he was now busy in
writing a natural history, and ... had taken lodgings,
at a farmer's house, near to the six mile-stone,
on the Edgeware road, and had carried down
his books in two returned post-chaises.... I went to
visit him at this place ... and found curious scraps
of descriptions of animals, scrawled upon the wall
with a black lead pencil."

When Johnson heard of the project, he said:

"Goldsmith, Sir, will give us a very fine book
upon the subject; but if he can distinguish a cow
from a horse, that, I believe, may be the extent of
his knowledge of natural history."

Goldsmith was certainly not very sound on cows.
This is what he says of their horns:

"At three years old the cow sheds its horns, and
new ones arise in their place, which continue as
long as it lives"!
[Pg 100]
But all that Goldsmith wrote had charm, and no
one was more sensitive to it than Johnson.

In conversation Goldsmith was not so happy.
Garrick described him as one


... for shortness call'd Noll,
Who wrote like an angel, but talked like poor Poll,


and Johnson said of him: "No man was more foolish
when he had not a pen in his hand, or more
wise when he had."

The truth was that Goldsmith's vanity, which
made him eager to get in and shine, could not bear
the rough buffetings of Johnson's talk. "There
is no arguing with Johnson," he complained, "for
when his pistol misses fire, he knocks you down
with the butt end of it."

He was as vain of his fine clothes, when he had
money to buy them, as of his literary reputation:

"Well, let me tell you," he said once, "when
my tailor brought home my bloom-coloured coat,
he said, 'Sir, I have a favour to beg of you. When
any body asks you who made your clothes, be
pleased to mention John Filby, at the Harrow, in
Water-lane.' Johnson. 'Why, Sir, that was because
he knew the strange colour would attract
crowds to gaze at it, and thus they might hear of
him, and see how well he could make a coat even
of so absurd a colour.'"

Once at a dinner-party Goldsmith became really
angry when "beginning to speak, he found himself
overpowered by the loud voice of Johnson,
who was at the opposite end of the table." When
at length he complained, Johnson silenced him by
calling him impertinent.


  
  Johnson and Goldsmith outside Filby's shop
  

[Pg 101]
But later, at the Club, they were quickly reconciled:

"'Dr Goldsmith,' said Johnson, 'something
passed to-day where you and I dined; I ask your
pardon.' Goldsmith answered placidly, 'It must
be much from you, Sir, that I take ill.' And so at
once the difference was over, and they were on as
easy terms as ever, and Goldsmith rattled away as
usual."

Sometimes Goldsmith had the last word, as
when they were discussing the writing of a good
fable, like that of the little fishes:

"'The skill,' said Goldsmith, 'consists in making
them talk like little fishes.' While he indulged
himself in this fanciful reverie, he observed Johnson
shaking his sides, and laughing. Upon which
he smartly proceeded, 'Why, Dr Johnson, this is
not so easy as you seem to think; for if you were
to make little fishes talk, they would talk like
WHALES.'"

But these victories and defeats in conversation
were only incidents in the history of a well-tried
friendship.

When Goldsmith died in 1774 at the age
of 46, Johnson wrote to his friend, Bennet
Langton:

"Poor Goldsmith is gone.... He died of a fever,
exasperated, as I believe, by the fear of distress.
He had raised money and squandered it, by
every artifice of acquisition and folly of expence.
But let not his frailties be remembered; he was a
very great man."

"Goldsmith" he said many years later, "was a
[Pg 102]
man who, whatever he wrote, did it better than
any other man could do. He deserved a place in
Westminster-Abbey, and every year he lived,
would have deserved it better."

Westminster Abbey holds a memorial, but not
the mortal remains, of Oliver Goldsmith.

For the monument which, at the suggestion of
Sir Joshua Reynolds, was set up in the Abbey two
years after Goldsmith's death Johnson wrote the
inscription.

"I ... send you," he wrote to Sir Joshua, "the
poor dear Doctor's epitaph. Read it first yourself;
and if you then think it right, shew it to
the Club. I am, you know, willing to be corrected."

The Club suggested several alterations, the
chief of them being that the epitaph should be in
English rather than in Latin.

"But the question was, who should have the
courage to propose them to him [Johnson]. At
last it was hinted, that there could be no way so
good as that of a Round Robin, as the sailors call it,
which they make use of when they enter into a conspiracy,
so as not to let it be known who puts his
name first or last to the paper.... Sir Joshua agreed
to carry it to Dr Johnson, who received it with
much good humour, and desired Sir Joshua to tell
the gentlemen, that he would alter the Epitaph
in any manner they pleased, as to the sense
of it; but he would never consent to disgrace the
walls of Westminster Abbey with an English inscription."

Here we will risk the posthumous wrath of
[Pg 103]
Johnson and give the first sentence of the epitaph
in English:

Oliver Goldsmith
Poet, Naturalist, Historian,
Who scarce left a single kind of writing
Untouched
And touched none that he did not adorn.

Sir Joshua Reynolds


Whether we have read Boswell or not,
we all know something of the work of Sir
Joshua Reynolds. From childhood, almost from
babyhood, we are made familiar with The Infant
Samuel and The Age of Innocence.

But it is as a portrait-painter that he is most
famous and in the latter half of the eighteenth
century there was hardly a single man or woman
of note whose portrait was not painted by him. A
few of them are reproduced in this book.

Born in Devonshire, Joshua Reynolds came to
study art in London in 1741. He was then 18 years
old and, except for a year or two spent at Plymouth
and two years' study of the old masters at Rome,
practically all his work was done, as Johnson's was,
in London.

He was the first president of the Royal Academy,
founded in 1768, and was made a knight in
[Pg 104]
the same year; he was supreme among the artists
of his day as was Garrick among actors and Johnson
among men of letters.

He did not have the same hard struggle for fame
and fortune as Johnson. At the age of 35, it is true,
he was painting portraits for fifteen guineas apiece,
but his charm of manner, as well as his skill as a
painter, brought him great popularity, and in a few
years' time he was making an annual income nearly
four times as great as the total sum paid to Johnson
for his Dictionary.

Reynolds was first attracted to Johnson by one
of his earliest prose works       The Life of Richard
Savage[26].

"Sir Joshua Reynolds told me, that upon his
return from Italy, he met with it in Devonshire,
knowing nothing of its authour, and began to read
it while he was standing with his arm leaning against
a chimney-piece. It seized his attention so strongly,
that, not being able to lay down the book till he
had finished, when he attempted to move, he found
his arm totally benumbed."

Shortly after this the two men met for the first
time at the house of the Miss Cotterells:

"Mr Reynolds had ... conceived a very high
admiration of Johnson's powers of writing. His
conversation no less delighted him; and he cultivated
his acquaintance with the laudable zeal of
one who was ambitious of general improvement....
Johnson at once perceived that Reynolds had the
habit of thinking for himself ... he went home with
Reynolds, and supped with him."


  
  Sir Joshua Reynolds
  

[Pg 105]

This was the beginning of an "uninterrupted
intimacy" to the last hour of Johnson's life.

Johnson took, or pretended to take, no interest
in pictures. He is reported to have said once that
"he should sit very quietly in a room hung round
with the works of the greatest masters, and never
feel the slightest disposition to turn them, if their
backs were outermost, unless it might be for the
sake of telling Sir Joshua that he had turned
them"!

At another time "Johnson being at dinner at
Sir Joshua's in company with many painters, in
the course of conversation Richardson's Treatise
on Painting happened to be mentioned. 'Ah!' said
Johnson, 'I remember, when I was at college, I
by chance found that book on my stairs. I took it
up with me to my chamber, and read it through,
and truly I did not think it possible to say so
much upon the art.'"

But this was merely playful exaggeration.
Johnson was at any rate interested in the portraits
of himself, of which Sir Joshua painted several.
One of them was set up in Lichfield:


"To Sir Joshua Reynolds, in Leicester-fields



Dear Sir,

When I came to Lichfield, I found that
my portrait had been much visited, and much admired.
Every man has a lurking wish to appear
considerable in his native place; and I was pleased
with the dignity conferred by such a testimony of
[Pg 106]
your regard. Be pleased, therefore, to accept the
thanks of, Sir, your most obliged


And most humble servant,
Sam. Johnson.

Ashbourn in Derbyshire,
July 17, 1771.

Compliments to Miss Reynolds."

Mrs Thrale tells another story of one of the
portraits:

"When Reynolds painted his portrait looking
into the slit of his pen and holding it almost close
to his eye, as was his custom, he felt displeased,
and told me he would not be known by posterity
for his defects only, let Sir Joshua do his worst. I
said that the picture in the room where we were
talking represented Sir Joshua holding his ear in
his hand to catch the sound. 'He may paint himself
as deaf, if he chooses,' replied Johnson, 'but
I will not be blinking Sam.'"

Every year Reynolds used to deliver an address
to the Royal Academy. These were collected into
a book with the title Discourses on Painting and the
author of them freely owned his debt to Johnson:
"He may be said to have formed my mind, and to
have brushed from it a great deal of rubbish."

"Reynolds" said Edmund Burke "owed much
to the writings and conversation of Johnson; and
nothing shews more the greatness of Sir Joshua's
parts than his taking advantage of both, and making
some application of them to his profession,
when Johnson neither understood nor desired to
understand anything of painting."
[Pg 107]
But Johnson could understand his friend's writing:

"Though he had no taste for painting, he admired
much the manner in which Sir Joshua Reynolds
treated of his art, in his Discourses to the Royal
Academy. He observed one day of a passage in
them 'I think I might as well have said this myself:'
and once when Mr Langton was sitting by
him, he read one of them very eagerly, and expressed
himself thus:       'Very well, Master Reynolds;
very well, indeed. But it will not be understood.'"

Sir Joshua, as we have seen, was the founder of
the Literary Club and was "very constant" in his
attendance. Boswell records, too, many a dinner-party
where Johnson and he enjoyed good fare and
good talk together, but most of the talk recorded
is, naturally, Johnson's:

"On Tuesday, April 18, [1775] he and I were
engaged to go with Sir Joshua Reynolds to dine
with Mr Cambridge, at his beautiful villa on the
banks of the Thames, near Twickenham. Dr Johnson's
tardiness was such, that Sir Joshua, who had
an appointment at Richmond, early in the day, was
obliged to go by himself on horseback, leaving his
coach to Johnson and me. Johnson was in such
good spirits, that every thing seemed to please him
as we drove along. Our conversation turned on
a variety of subjects. He thought portrait-painting
an improper employment for a woman. 'Publick
practice of any art (he observed,) and staring
in men's faces, is very indelicate in a female'....
No sooner had we made our bow to Mr Cambridge,
[Pg 108]
in his library, than Johnson ran eagerly to
one side of the room, intent on poring over the
backs of the books. Sir Joshua observed, (aside,)
'He runs to the books, as I do to the pictures: but
I have the advantage. I can see much more of the
pictures than he can of the books.'"

Johnson and Reynolds often rallied each other
on the subject of drinking. Reynolds reminded
his friend once that he had had eleven cups of tea.
"Sir," replied Johnson "I did not count your
glasses of wine, why should you number up my
cups of tea?"

For long periods of his life, as we have seen,
Johnson abstained from wine altogether; at such
times he was liable to be overbearing, not to say
rude, in discussing the social benefits of drinking:

"Boswell. 'The great difficulty of resisting
wine is from benevolence. For instance, a good
worthy man asks you to taste his wine, which he
has had twenty years in his cellar.' Johnson. 'Sir,
all this notion about benevolence arises from a
man's imagining himself to be of more importance
to others, than he really is. They don't care a
farthing whether he drinks or not.' Sir Joshua
Reynolds. 'Yes, they do for the time'.... I was at
this time myself a water-drinker, upon trial, by
Johnson's recommendation. Johnson. 'Boswell
is a bolder combatant than Sir Joshua: he argues
for wine without the help of wine; but Sir Joshua
with it.' Sir Joshua Reynolds. 'But to please
one's company is a strong motive.' Johnson
(who, from drinking only water, supposed every
body who drank wine to be elevated,) 'I won't
[Pg 109]
argue any more with you, Sir. You are too far
gone.' Sir Joshua. 'I should have thought so indeed,
Sir, had I made such a speech as you have
now done.' Johnson (drawing himself in, and, I
really thought blushing,). 'Nay, don't be angry.
I did not mean to offend you.'"

This is said to be the only known instance of
Johnson having blushed. Few, indeed, would
have rebuked him so neatly or so gently as the
courteous Sir Joshua.

But all Johnson's quarrels with his friends were
momentary. In 1782, after Reynolds had been ill,
we find him writing:



"Your country has been in danger of losing
one of its brightest ornaments, and I of losing one
of my oldest and kindest friends: but I hope you
will still live long, for the honour of the nation:
and that more enjoyment of your elegance, your
intelligence, and your benevolence, is still reserved
for, dear Sir, your most affectionate,      c.

Sam. Johnson."

This is a good example of "Johnsonese" in
letter-writing. Nowadays we cannot imagine a
letter written in such a style to an intimate friend
of 30 years' standing. But Johnson meant every
word of it.

On his death-bed his last requests of Sir Joshua
were simpler:


"To forgive him thirty pounds which he had
borrowed of him; to read the Bible; and never
to use his pencil on a Sunday."

Sir Joshua readily acquiesced.

[Pg 110]

Bennet Langton and Topham
Beauclerk


"Sir," said Dr Johnson "I look upon every
day to be lost, in which I do not make a
new acquaintance," and even Boswell did not
attempt "to trace his acquaintance with each
particular person."

A task from which Boswell shrank will certainly
not be attempted here; but two friends, who were
both original members of the Literary Club and
whose names occur very often in Boswell's story,
must be considered for a moment       Bennet Langton
and Topham Beauclerk.

Bennet Langton, who had come to London
"chiefly with the view of endeavouring to be introduced
to its [The Rambler's] authour," happened
to stay in a house visited by Mr Levet,
and Mr Levet obtained Johnson's permission to
bring his admirer to visit him.

"Mr Langton was exceedingly surprised when
the sage first appeared. He had not received the
smallest intimation of his figure, dress, or manner.
From perusing his writings, he fancied he should
see a decent, well-drest, in short, a remarkably decorous
philosopher. Instead of which, down from
his bedchamber, about noon, came, as newly risen,
a huge uncouth figure, with a little dark wig
[Pg 111]
which scarcely covered his head, and his clothes
hanging loose about him. But his conversation
was so rich, so animated, and so forcible, and his
religious and political notions so congenial with
those in which Langton had been educated, that
he conceived for him that veneration and attachment
which he ever preserved. Johnson was not
the less ready to love Mr Langton, for his being
of a very ancient family."

Langton was "a very tall, meagre, long-visaged
man, much resembling a stork standing on one
leg"; Johnson, with his usual fondness for nicknames,
appropriately called him "Lanky." He
visited him at his home in Lincolnshire, at Rochester,
and at Warley Camp (where he was stationed
with his regiment of militia
[27])
and, though he did
not always approve of his domestic arrangements
("His table is rather coarse" he said "and he has
his children too much about him"), he kept a deep
and almost reverent affection for the pious and
scholarly country squire.

Not long before his death he was discussing
Langton's character with Boswell:

"He said 'I know not who will go to Heaven
if Langton does not'.... He however charged Mr
Langton with what he thought want of judgement
upon an interesting occasion. 'When I was ill,
(said he) I desired he would tell me sincerely in
what he thought my life was faulty. Sir, he brought
me a sheet of paper, on which he had written down
several texts of Scripture, recommending christian
charity. And when I questioned him what
[Pg 112]
occasion I had given for such an animadversion,
all that he could say amounted to this,       that I
sometimes contradicted people in conversation.
Now what harm does it do to any man to be contradicted?'
Boswell. 'I suppose he meant the
manner of doing it; roughly,       and harshly.' Johnson.
'And who is the worse for that?' Boswell.
'It hurts people of weak nerves.' Johnson. 'I
know no such weak-nerved people.' Mr Burke,
to whom I related this conference, said, 'It is well,
if when a man comes to die, he has nothing heavier
upon his conscience than having been a little
rough in conversation.' Johnson, at the time
when the paper was presented to him, though at
first pleased with the attention of his friend, whom
he thanked in an earnest manner, soon exclaimed,
in a loud and angry tone, 'What is your drift, Sir?'
Sir Joshua Reynolds pleasantly observed, that it
was a scene for a comedy, to see a penitent get
into a violent passion and belabour his confessor."

When Johnson was stricken down by his last
illness, nobody was more attentive to him than
Mr Langton, to whom he tenderly said, "Te teneam
moriens deficiente manu"       "When I die, let it be
you that my hand holds in its weakening grasp."

Topham Beauclerk, who was at Oxford with
Langton, was a man of very different type. He
had "the character of being loose, both in his principles
and practice"; yet "in a short time, the
moral, pious Johnson, and the gay, dissipated
Beauclerk, were companions."

'"What a coalition! (said Garrick, when he
[Pg 113]
heard of this;): I shall have my old friend to bail
out of the Round-house.' But I can bear testimony
that it was a very agreeable association.
Beauclerk was too polite, and valued learning and
wit too much, to offend Johnson ... and Johnson
delighted in the good qualities of Beauclerk, and
hoped to correct the evil. Innumerable were the
scenes in which Johnson was amused by these
young men."

Here is one of the most entertaining accounts
of Johnson in their company:

"One night when Beauclerk and Langton had
supped at a tavern in London, and sat till about
three in the morning, it came into their heads to
go and knock up Johnson, and see if they could
prevail on him to join them in a ramble. They
rapped violently at the door of his chambers in
the Temple, till at last he appeared in his shirt,
with his little black wig on the top of his head,
instead of a nightcap, and a poker in his hand,
imagining, probably, that some ruffians were coming
to attack him. When he discovered who they
were, and was told their errand, he smiled, and
with great good humour agreed to their proposal:
'What, is it you, you dogs! I'll have a frisk with
you.' He was soon drest, and they sallied forth
together into Covent-Garden, where the greengrocers
and fruiterers were beginning to arrange
their hampers, just come in from the country.
Johnson made some attempts to help them; but
the honest gardeners stared so at his figure and
manner, and odd interference, that he soon saw
his services were not relished. They then repaired
[Pg 114]
to one of the neighbouring taverns, and made a
bowl of that liquor called Bishop, which Johnson
had always liked; while in joyous contempt of
sleep, from which he had been roused, he repeated
the festive lines,


Short, O short then be thy reign,
And give us to the world again!


They did not stay long, but walked down to
the Thames, took a boat, and rowed to Billingsgate.
Beauclerk and Johnson were so well pleased
with their amusement, that they resolved to persevere
in dissipation for the rest of the day: but
Langton deserted them, being engaged to breakfast
with some young Ladies. Johnson scolded
him for 'leaving his social friends, to go and sit
with a set of wretched un-idea'd girls.' Garrick
being told of this ramble, said to him smartly, 'I
heard of your frolick t'other night. You'll be in
the Chronicle.' Upon which Johnson afterwards
observed 'He durst not do such a thing. His wife
would not let him!'"

At another time Beauclerk was tickled by a
sudden display of gallantry on Johnson's part:

"When Madame de Boufflers was first in England,
(said Beauclerk,) she was desirous to see
Johnson. I accordingly went with her to his chambers
in the Temple, where she was entertained
with his conversation for some time. When our
visit was over, she and I left him, and were got
into Inner Temple-lane, when all at once I heard a
noise like thunder. This was occasioned by Johnson,
who it seems, upon a little recollection, had
taken it into his head that he ought to have done
[Pg 115]
the honours of his literary residence to a foreign
lady of quality, and eager to shew himself a man of
gallantry, was hurrying down the stair-case in violent
agitation. He overtook us before we reached
the Temple-gate, and brushing in between me and
Madame de Boufflers, seized her hand, and conducted
her to her coach. His dress was a rusty
brown morning suit, a pair of old shoes by way
of slippers, a little shrivelled wig sticking on the
top of his head, and the sleeves of his shirt and
the knees of his breeches hanging loose. A considerable
crowd of people gathered round, and
were not a little struck by this singular appearance."

"Poor dear Beauclerk ..." wrote Johnson when
he died "His wit and his folly, his acuteness and
maliciousness, his merriment and reasoning, are
now over. Such another will not often be found
among mankind."

Mrs Thrale


From what we already know of Johnson, we
do not picture him at his ease in ladies' drawing-rooms.
But he had violent fits of gallantry,
as we have just seen, and he told Boswell once that
he considered himself a "very polite man." He
could, indeed, be as happy in a boudoir as in a
tavern, provided the dinner had been good and
his hostess would allow him to have his talk out.

[Pg 116]

"This year [1765] was distinguished by his
being introduced into the family of Mr Thrale,
one of the most eminent brewers in England,
and Member of Parliament for the borough of
Southwark.... Mr Thrale had married Miss Hesther
Lynch Salusbury, of good Welsh extraction,
a lady of lively talents, improved by education....
Mr Murphy, who was intimate with Mr Thrale,
having spoken very highly of Dr Johnson, he was
requested to make them acquainted. This being
mentioned to Johnson, he accepted of an invitation
to dinner at Thrale's, and was so much pleased
with his reception, both by Mr and Mrs Thrale,
and they so much pleased with him, that his invitations
to their house were more and more frequent,
till at last he became one of the family, and
an apartment was appropriated to him, both in
their house at Southwark, and in their villa at
Streatham. Johnson had a very sincere esteem
for Mr Thrale, as a man of excellent principles, a
good scholar, well skilled in trade, of a sound
understanding, and of manners such as presented
the character of a plain independent English
Squire.... 'I know no man, (said he,) who is more
master of his wife and family than Thrale. If he
but holds up a finger, he is obeyed. It is a great
mistake to suppose that she is above him in
literary attainments. She is more flippant; but he
has ten times her learning: he is a regular scholar;
but her learning is that of a school-boy in one
of the lower forms.' ... Mr Thrale was tall, well
proportioned, and stately. As for Madam, or my
Mistress, by which epithets Johnson used to mention
[Pg 117]
Mrs Thrale, she was short, plump, and brisk.
She has herself given us a lively view of the idea
which Johnson had of her person, on her appearing
before him in a dark-coloured gown; 'You
little creatures should never wear those sort of
clothes, however; they are unsuitable in every
way. What! have not all insects gay colours?'
Mr Thrale gave his wife a liberal indulgence,
both in the choice of their company, and in the
mode of entertaining them. He understood and
valued Johnson, without remission, from their
first acquaintance to the day of his death. Mrs
Thrale was enchanted with Johnson's conversation,
for its own sake, and had also a very allowable
vanity in appearing to be honoured with the
attention of so celebrated a man. Nothing could
be more fortunate for Johnson than this connection.
He had at Mr Thrale's all the comforts and
even luxuries of life; his melancholy was diverted,
and his irregular habits lessened by association
with an agreeable and well-ordered family. He
was treated with the utmost respect and even
affection. The vivacity of Mrs Thrale's literary
talk roused him to cheerfulness and exertion, even
when they were alone. But this was not often the
case; for he found here a constant succession of
what gave him the highest enjoyment: the society
of the learned, the witty, and the eminent in every
way, who were assembled in numerous companies,
called forth his wonderful powers, and gratified
him with admiration, to which no man could be
insensible."


  
  Mrs Thrale
  

Such was the beginning of this friendship, as
[Pg 118]
told by Boswell, who was not introduced to the
Thrale family for some years and could not always
conceal a little jealousy of this new intimacy of
his hero. Mrs Thrale has left us a book of Anecdotes
of Dr Johnson, and, though Boswell declares
that they are not always accurate, we must quote
a few passages from them to shew how Johnson
used to the full the "comforts and even luxuries"
of a well-furnished home. For he did not trouble
to adapt himself to the household; he made the
household adapt itself to him, "often sitting up
as long as the fire and candles lasted, and much
longer than the patience of the servants subsisted."

"Dr Johnson" says Mrs Thrale "was always
exceeding fond of chemistry; and we made up a
sort of laboratory at Streatham one summer, and
diverted ourselves with drawing essences and colouring
liquors. But the danger Mr Thrale found
his friend in one day when I was driven to London,
and he had got the children and servants round
him to see some experiments performed, put an
end to all our entertainment; so well was the
master of the house persuaded, that his short
sight would have been his destruction in a moment,
by bringing him close to a fierce and violent
flame. Indeed it was a perpetual miracle that he
did not set himself on fire reading a-bed, as was
his constant custom, when exceedingly unable
even to keep clear of mischief with our best help;
and accordingly the fore-top of all his wigs were
burned by the candle down to the very net-work.
Mr Thrale's valet-de-chambre, for that reason,
[Pg 119]
kept one always in his own hands, with which he
met him at the parlour-door, when the bell had
called him down to dinner, and as he went up
stairs to sleep in the afternoon, the same man
constantly followed him with another.... Mr Johnson's
amusements were thus reduced to the pleasures
of conversation merely.... Conversation was
all he required to make him happy; and when he
would have tea made at two o'clock in the morning,
it was only that there might be a certainty of
detaining his companions round him. On that principle
it was that he preferred winter to summer,
when the heat of the weather gave people an
excuse to stroll about, and walk for pleasure in
the shade, while he wished to sit still on a chair,
and chat day after day, till somebody proposed a
drive in the coach; and that was the most delicious
moment of his life. 'But the carriage must stop
sometime (as he said), and the people would come
home at last'; so his pleasure was of short duration.
I asked him why he doated on a coach so?
and received for answer, 'That in the first place,
the company was shut in with him there; and
could not escape, as out of a room: in the next
place he heard all that was said in a carriage,
where it was my turn to be deaf': and very impatient
was he at my occasional difficulty of hearing.
On this account he wished to travel all over
the world; for the very act of going forward was
delightful to him, and he gave himself no concern
about accidents, which he said never happened."

Johnson travelled a great deal with the Thrales,
visiting Bath, North Wales, Brighton, and even
[Pg 120]
France in their company
[28].
Mr Thrale used to persuade
him to mount a horse, as well as ride in a
coach:

"He certainly rode on Mr Thrale's old hunter
with a good firmness, and though he would follow
the hounds fifty miles on end sometimes, would
never own himself either tired or amused. 'I have
now learned (said he) by hunting, to perceive,
that it is no diversion at all, nor ever takes a man
out of himself for a moment.' ... He was, however,
proud to be amongst the sportsmen; and I think
no praise ever went so close to his heart, as when
Mr Hamilton called out one day upon Brighthelmstone
Downs, 'Why Johnson rides as well,
for aught I see, as the most illiterate fellow in
England.'"

Having settled in her house as one of the
family, Johnson did not hesitate to give Mrs Thrale
fatherly advice on such domestic subjects as dress,
food, and children.

"I advised Mrs Thrale," he told Boswell "who
has no card-parties at her house, to give sweetmeats,
and such good things, in an evening, as are
not commonly given, and she would find company
enough come to her; for everybody loves to have
things which please the palate put in their way,
without trouble or preparation."

"Johnson's own notions about eating" says
Mrs Thrale "were nothing less than delicate; a
leg of pork boiled till it dropped from the bone,
a veal-pye with plums and sugar, or the outside
cut of a salt buttock of beef, were his favourite
dainties."


  
  Mrs Thrale's Breakfast-table
  

[Pg 121]

Johnson expressed strong views to Mrs Thrale
about children's books:

"'Babies do not want (said he) to hear about
babies; they like to be told of giants and castles,
and of somewhat which can stretch and stimulate
their little minds.' When in answer I would urge
the numerous editions and quick sale of Tommy
Prudent or Goody Two Shoes, 'Remember always
(said he) that the parents buy the books, and that
the children never read them.'"

When he suspected her of insincerity, Johnson
was as blunt with his hostess as with any of his
friends at the club:

"Mrs Thrale, while supping very heartily upon
larks, laid down her knife and fork, and abruptly
exclaimed, 'O, my dear Mr Johnson, do you know
what has happened? The last letters from abroad
have brought us an account that our poor cousin's
head was taken off by a cannon-ball.' Johnson,
who was shocked both at the fact, and her light unfeeling
manner of mentioning it, replied 'Madam,
it would give you very little concern if all your
relations were spitted like those larks, and drest
for Presto's[29] supper.'"

At another dinner-party on Sunday, April 1,
1781, when Boswell was present,

"Mrs Thrale gave high praise to Mr Dudley
Long, (now North). Johnson. 'Nay, my dear lady,
don't talk so. Mr Long's character is very short[30].
It is nothing. He fills a chair. He is a man of
[Pg 122]
genteel appearance, and that is all. I know nobody
who blasts by praise as you do: for whenever
there is exaggerated praise, every body is set
against a character.... By the same principle, your
malice defeats itself; for your censure is too violent.
And yet (looking to her with a leering smile)
she is the first woman in the world, could she but
restrain that wicked tongue of hers;       she would
be the only woman, could she but command that
little whirligig.'"

Shortly after this party Mr Thrale died, having
made Johnson one of the executors of his will.

"I could not but be somewhat diverted" says
Boswell "by hearing Johnson talk in a pompous
manner of his new office, and particularly of the
concerns of the brewery, which it was at last resolved
should be sold.... When the sale ... was
going forward, Johnson appeared bustling about,
with an ink-horn and pen in his button-hole, like
an excise-man; and on being asked what he really
considered to be the value of the property which
was to be disposed of, answered, 'We are not here
to sell a parcel of boilers and vats, but the potentiality
of growing rich, beyond the dreams of
avarice[31].'"

"The death of Mr Thrale ... made a very
material alteration with respect to Johnson's reception
in that family. The manly authority of the
husband no longer curbed the lively exuberance
of the lady; and as her vanity had been fully
gratified, by having the Colossus of Literature
[Pg 123]
attached to her for many years, she gradually became
less assiduous to please him."

Johnson, however, continued to spend much
of his time with Mrs Thrale both in London and
Brighton.

But near the end of Johnson's life there came
the final blow to the friendship:

"Dr Johnson had the mortification of being informed
by Mrs Thrale, that, 'what she supposed
he never believed,' was true; namely, that she was
actually going to marry Signor Piozzi, an Italian
musick-master. He endeavoured to prevent it;
but in vain."

Though he wrote rather bitterly of the marriage
to his friends, Johnson was generous in his
farewell letter to Mrs Thrale:

"What you have done, however I may lament
it, I have no pretence to resent, as it has not been
injurious to me. I therefore breathe out one sigh
more of tenderness, perhaps useless, but at least
sincere.... Whatever I can contribute to your happiness
I am very ready to repay, for that kindness
which soothed twenty years of a life radically
wretched."

[Pg 124]

Fanny Burney


A full account of the twenty years' friendship
of Johnson and the Thrales would fill a
book much larger than this; and in such a volume
there would often occur the name of Fanny
Burney.

Dr Burney was a musician who had come to
London in 1760. He was a member of the Club,
and became an intimate friend of Johnson.
Frances, who had lived with her father, while her
sisters went to school in France, had had a passion
for writing since the age of 10, and was eager to
meet the great man. She first saw him in 1777
at one of her father's parties, where her sisters
were playing a duet. In the midst of their performance
Dr Johnson was announced.

"He is very ill-favoured ..." she wrote to a friend
"his body is in continual agitation, see-sawing up
and down.... He is shockingly near-sighted, and
did not, till she held out her hand to him, even
know Mrs Thrale. He poked his nose over the keys
of the harpsichord, till the duet was finished, and
then my father introduced Hetty to him as an old
acquaintance, and he kissed her! When she was a
little girl, he had made her a present of The Idler.
His attention, however, was not to be diverted
five minutes from the books, as we were in the
[Pg 125]
library; he pored over them, almost touching the
backs of them with his eye-lashes, as he read their
titles. At last, having fixed upon one, he began,
without further ceremony, to read, all the time
standing at a distance from the company. We were
all very much provoked, as we perfectly languished
to hear him talk."


  
  Fanny Burney
  

At last Dr Burney dragged him into the conversation,
which happened to be about one of
Bach's concerts:

"The Doctor ... good-naturedly put away his
book, and said very drolly, 'And pray, Sir, who is
Bach? is he a piper?'"

Fanny's greatest achievement was her novel,
Evelina, or a Young Lady's Entrance into the World.
She planned it when she was fifteen and wrote it
some years later. She had "an odd inclination"
to see her work in print and, without putting any
name to the manuscript or letting her secret be
known outside her own family, she offered her
story to the booksellers and eventually received
twenty pounds for it.

When it was published, it took the town by
storm. Johnson "got it by heart" and, as soon as
the author was revealed, introduced Fanny to the
circle at Streatham and made her one of his closest
friends. He called her his "dear little Burney"
and was always making pretty speeches to her:

"Miss Burney, calling on him the next morning,
offered to make his tea. He had given her
his own large arm-chair which was too heavy for
her to move to the table. 'Sir' quoth she 'I am in
the wrong chair.' 'It is so difficult,' cried he with
[Pg 126]
quickness, 'for anything to be wrong that belongs
to you, that it can only be I that am in the wrong
chair to keep you from the right one.'"

They were guests together of Mrs Thrale at
Brighton and one night "to the universal amazement"
Johnson went to a ball:

"He said he had found it so dull being quite
alone the preceding evening, that he determined
upon going with us; 'for,' said he, 'it cannot be
worse than being alone.'"

He liked to treat Fanny, his "little character-monger,"
as a fellow-author:

"A shilling was now wanted for some purpose
or other, and none of them happened to have one;
I begged that I might lend one. 'Ay, do' said the
Doctor 'I will borrow of you; authors are like
privateers, always fair game for one another.'"

In his last illness Johnson received Fanny into
his house as long as he could. But on 25 November
1784, though his faculties were bright, the
machine that contained them was "alarmingly
giving away":

"I saw him growing worse, and offered to go,
which, for the first time I ever remember, he did
not oppose; but most kindly pressing both my
hands, 'Be not' he said, in a voice of even tenderness
'be not longer in coming again for my letting
you go now.' I assured him I would be the
sooner, and was running off, but he called me back
in a solemn voice, and in a manner the most energetic,
said:       'Remember me in your prayers.'"

Two days before his death, when Dr Burney
saw him, his message was the same:
[Pg 127]
"He was up and very composed. He took his
hand very kindly, asked after all his family, and
then in particular how Fanny did. 'I hope,' he said
'Fanny did not take it amiss that I did not see
her. I was very bad. Tell Fanny to pray for me.'"

On the 20th December, when the "ever-honoured,
ever-lamented" Dr Johnson was
committed to the earth, Fanny could not keep
her eyes dry all day.




The Tour to the Hebrides


"Dr Johnson" says Boswell at the beginning
of his account of this famous tour
"had for many years given me hopes that we
should go together, and visit the Hebrides."

They had first discussed the project in a coffee-house
in the Strand in 1763, Johnson being especially
eager to see the patriarchal life of the
Highlands       the clansmen living and working and
fighting and dying under the fatherly rule of their
chieftain. Boswell, knowing something of his
friend's love of Fleet Street and of his prejudice
against Scotland, "doubted that it would not be
possible to prevail on Dr Johnson to relinquish
the felicity of a London life."

"To Scotland, however, he ventured," and the
faithful Boswell has left us a careful record of his
adventures and his talk on each of the 100 days
[Pg 128]
he spent there. This Journal was warmly praised
by Johnson, who read the manuscript, and was
published in the year after his death. Here we
must be content with extracts, first following the
travellers along the east coast of Scotland, where
Johnson found the trees very few:

"On Saturday the fourteenth of August, 1773,
late in the evening, I received a note from him,
that he was arrived at Boyd's inn, at the head of
the Canongate, [Edinburgh]. I went to him directly.
He embraced me cordially; and I exulted
in the thought, that I now had him actually in
Caledonia.... He was to do me the honour to lodge
under my roof...."

"Mr Johnson and I walked arm-in-arm up the
High-street, to my house in James's court: it was
a dusky night: I could not prevent his being assailed
by the evening effluvia of Edinburgh....
Walking the streets ... at night was pretty perilous,
and a good deal odoriferous. The peril is much
abated, by the care which the magistrates have
taken to enforce the city laws against throwing
foul water from the windows; but from the structure
of the houses in the old town, which consist
of many stories, in each of which a different
family lives, and there being no covered sewers,
the odour still continues. A zealous Scotsman
would have wished Mr Johnson to be without
one of his five senses upon this occasion. As we
marched slowly along, he grumbled in my ear, 'I
smell you in the dark.'"


  
  Johnson and Boswell arm-in-arm up the High Street
  

      


  
  Johnson under Boswell's roof
  

"Wednesday, August 18.

On this day we set out from Edinburgh.... From
[Pg 129]
an erroneous apprehension of violence, Dr Johnson
had provided a pair of pistols, some gunpowder,
and a quantity of bullets: but upon being
assured we should run no risk of meeting any robbers,
he left his arms and ammunition in an open
drawer of which he gave my wife the charge....
When we came to Leith, I talked with perhaps
too boasting an air, how pretty the Frith of Forth
looked; as indeed, after the prospect from Constantinople,
of which I have been told, and that
from Naples, which I have seen, I believe the view
of that Frith and its environs, from the Castlehill
of Edinburgh, is the finest prospect in Europe.
'Ay, (said Dr Johnson,) that is the state of the
world. Water is the same every where.'"

Travelling by coach along the coast-road they
visited St Andrews, Dundee, and Montrose and
on Saturday evening reached Aberdeen, where
Johnson was cheered at finding a letter from his
"dear mistress," Mrs Thrale.


"Monday, August 23.

At one o'clock we waited on the magistrates
in the town hall, as they had invited us in order
to present Dr Johnson with the freedom of the
town, which Provost Jopp did with a very good
grace. Dr Johnson was much pleased with this
mark of attention, and received it very politely....
It was striking to hear all of them drinking
'Dr Johnson! Dr Johnson!' in the town-hall of
Aberdeen, and then to see him with his burgess-ticket,
or diploma, in his hat, which he wore as he
walked along the street, according to the usual
custom."

[Pg 130]

Johnson wrote of the ceremony to Mrs
Thrale:

"I was presented with the freedom of the city,
not in a gold box, but in good Latin. Let me pay
Scotland one just praise; there was no officer
gaping for a fee; this could have been said of no
city on the English side of the Tweed."


"Tuesday, August 24.

We set out about eight in the morning, and
breakfasted at Ellon. The landlady said to me
'Is not this the great Doctor that is going about
through the country?' I said, 'Yes.' 'Ay, (said she)
we heard of him. I made an errand into the room
on purpose to see him. There's something great
in his appearance: it is a pleasure to have such a
man in one's house; a man who does so much
good. If I had thought of it, I would have shewn
him a child of mine, who has had a lump on his
throat for some time.' 'But, (said I,) he is not a
doctor of physick.' 'Is he an oculist?' said the
landlord. 'No, (said I,) he is only a very learned
man.' Landlord. 'They say he is the greatest man
in England, except Lord Mansfield.' Dr Johnson
was highly entertained with this, and I do think
he was pleased too."

After visiting Staines Castle, Banff, Cullen
(where Johnson was disgusted by the appearance
of dried haddocks with the tea at breakfast),
Elgin (where he examined the cathedral
"with a most patient attention" in the rain),
Fores, Nairn, and Calder Castle, the travellers
reached Fort George, having an introduction to
"Mr Ferne, master of stores."

[Pg 131]

"Saturday, August 28.

Mr Ferne and Major Brewse first carried us to
wait on Sir Eyre Coote, whose regiment, the 37th,
was lying here, and who then commanded the
fort. He asked us to dine with him, which we
agreed to do. Before dinner we examined the fort.
The Major explained the fortification to us, and
Mr Ferne gave us an account of the stores. Dr
Johnson talked of the proportions of charcoal and
saltpetre in making gunpowder, of granulating it,
and of giving it a gloss. He made a very good
figure upon these topicks.... At three the drum
beat for dinner. I, for a little while, fancied myself
a military man, and it pleased me....

We had a dinner of two complete courses,
variety of wines, and the regimental band of
musick playing in the square, before the windows,
after it. I enjoyed this day much. We were
quite easy and cheerful. Dr Johnson said, 'I shall
always remember this fort with gratitude.'"


"Monday, August 30.

We might have taken a chaise to Fort Augustus,
but, had we not hired horses at Inverness,
we should not have found them afterwards: so
we resolved to begin here to ride.... Dr Johnson
rode very well....

When we had advanced a good way by the side
of Lochness, I perceived a little hut, with an old-looking
woman at the door of it. I thought here
might be a scene that would amuse Dr Johnson;
so I mentioned it to him. 'Let's go in' said he....
It was a wretched little hovel of earth only.... In
the middle of the room was a fire of peat, the
[Pg 132]
smoke going out at a hole in the roof. She had
a pot upon it, with goat's flesh, boiling....

The woman's name was Fraser; so was her husband's.
He was a man of eighty. Mr Fraser of
Balnain allows him to live in this hut, and keep
sixty goats, for taking care of the woods.... They
had five children.... This contented family had
four stacks of barley, twenty-four sheaves in each.
They had a few fowls.... They lived all the spring
without meal, upon milk and curds and whey
alone. What they get for their goats, kids, and
fowls, maintains them during the rest of the
year....

She said she was as happy as any woman in Scotland.
She could hardly speak any English except
a few detached words. Dr Johnson was pleased
at seeing for the first time, such a state of human
life. She asked for snuff. It is her luxury, and she
uses a great deal. We had none; but gave her sixpence
a piece. She then brought out her whiskey
bottle. I tasted it."


"Tuesday, August 31.

Between twelve and one we set out [from Fort
Augustus], and travelled eleven miles, through a
wild country, till we came to a house in Glenmorison,
called Anoch, kept by a M'Queen....
There were two beds in the room, and a woman's
gown was hung on a rope to make a curtain of
separation between them.... We had much hesitation,
whether to undress, or lie down with our
clothes on. I said at last 'I'll plunge in! There
will be less harbour for vermin about me, when
I am stripped!' Dr Johnson said, he was like one
[Pg 133]
hesitating whether to go into the cold bath. At
last he resolved too....

After we had offered up our private devotions,
and had chatted a little from our beds, Dr Johnson
said 'God bless us both, for Jesus Christ's
sake! Good night!' I pronounced 'Amen.' He
fell asleep immediately. I was not so fortunate for
a long time. I fancied myself bit by innumerable
vermin under the clothes; and that a spider was
travelling from the wainscot to my mouth. At last
I fell into insensibility."

The Island of Skye was reached on September
2, and a few days later came an invitation to
cross to Rasay.


"Wednesday, September 8.

We got into Rasay's carriage, which was a good
strong open boat made in Norway. The wind had
now risen pretty high, and was against us; but
we had four stout rowers, particularly a Macleod,
a robust black-haired fellow, half naked, and bareheaded,
something between a wild Indian and an
English tar. Dr Johnson sat high on the stern,
like a magnificent Triton. Malcolm sung an
Erse song.... The boatmen and Mr M'Queen
chorused, and all went well.... We sailed along
the coast of Scalpa, a rugged island, about four
miles in length. Dr Johnson proposed that he
and I should buy it, and found a good school,
and an episcopal church ... and have a printing-press,
where he would print all the Erse that
could be found.

Here I was strongly struck with our long
projected scheme of visiting the Hebrides being
[Pg 134]
realized. I called to him, 'We are contending with
seas'; which I think were the words of one of his
letters to me. 'Not much,' said he; and though
the wind made the sea lash considerably upon us,
he was not discomposed. After we were out of
the shelter of Scalpa, and in the sound between
it and Rasay, which extended about a league, the
wind made the sea very rough. I did not like it.
Johnson. 'This now is the Atlantick. If I should
tell at a tea table in London, that I have crossed
the Atlantick in an open boat, how they'd shudder,
and what a fool they'd think me to expose myself
to such danger?' ...

It was past six o'clock when we arrived. Some
excellent brandy was served round immediately,
according to the custom of the Highlands, where
a dram is generally taken every day.... On a sideboard
was placed for us ... a substantial dinner,
and a variety of wines. Then we had coffee and
tea.... Soon afterwards a fidler appeared, and a
little ball began. Rasay himself danced with as
much spirit as any man, and Malcolm bounded
like a roe.... Dr Johnson was so delighted with
this scene that he said, 'I know not how we shall
get away.'"


"Thursday, September 9.

The day was showery; however, Rasay and I
took a walk, and had some cordial conversation....
His family has possessed this island above four
hundred years.... When we returned, Dr Johnson
walked with us to see the old chapel. He was in
fine spirits. He said, 'This is truly the patriarchal
life: this is what we came to find.'"

[Pg 135]

This reception of Dr Johnson by Macleod of
Rasay may be taken as typical of the hospitality
shewn to him by the Highland chiefs, and the
story of many another jovial evening, for which
there is no space here, must be read in the pages
of Boswell's Journal.

Besides Skye and Rasay, they visited the islands
of Coll, Mull, and Iona; and, on reaching the
mainland, returned to Edinburgh by way of
Oban, Inverary, Dumbarton, Glasgow, and Auchinleck,
the home of Boswell's father.

But before leaving Skye, Johnson had a memorable
interview:


"Sunday, September 12.

I was highly pleased to see Dr Johnson safely
arrived at Kingsburgh, and received by the hospitable
Mr Macdonald....

There was a comfortable parlour with a good
fire, and a dram went round. By and by supper
was served, at which there appeared the lady of
the house, the celebrated Miss Flora Macdonald.
She is a little woman, of a genteel appearance,
and uncommonly mild and well-bred. To see Dr
Samuel Johnson, the great champion of the English
Tories, salute Miss Flora Macdonald in the
isle of Sky, was a striking sight.... Miss Flora
Macdonald ... told me, she heard upon the main
land ... that Mr Boswell was coming to Sky, and
one Mr Johnson, a young English buck, with him.
He was highly entertained with this fancy.... I
slept in the same room with Dr Johnson. Each
had a neat bed, with Tartan curtains, in an upper
chamber."

[Pg 136]

"Monday, September 13.

The room where we lay was a celebrated one.
Dr Johnson's bed was the very bed in which the
grandson of the unfortunate King James the
Second lay, on one of the nights after the failure of
his rash attempt in 1745-6.... To see Dr Samuel
Johnson lying in that bed, in the Isle of Sky, in
the house of Miss Flora Macdonald, struck me
with such a group of ideas as it is not easy for
words to describe, as they passed through the
mind. He smiled, and said, 'I have had no ambitious
thoughts in it.' The room was decorated
with a great variety of maps and prints. Among
others was Hogarth's print of Wilkes grinning,
with a cap of liberty on a pole by him....

At breakfast he said, he would have given a
good deal rather than not have lain in that bed.
I owned he was the lucky man; and observed,
that without doubt it had been contrived between
Mrs Macdonald and him. She seemed to acquiesce;
adding, 'You know young bucks are
always favourites of the ladies.' He spoke of
Prince Charles being here, and asked Mrs Macdonald,
'Who was with him? We were told,
madam, in England, there was one, Miss Flora
Macdonald with him.' She said 'they were very
right'; and ... very obligingly entertained him
with a recital of the particulars which she herself
knew of that escape....

Dr Johnson listened to her with placid attention,
and said, 'All this should be written down.'"

During his stay in Skye Dr Johnson had a mind
to become a chieftain himself:

[Pg 137]

"Thursday, September 23.

There is a beautiful little island in the Loch
of Dunvegan, called Isa. M'Leod said, he would
give it to Dr Johnson, on condition of his residing
on it three months in the year; nay one month.
Dr Johnson was highly amused with the fancy.
I have seen him please himself with little things,
even with mere ideas like the present. He talked
a great deal of this island;       how he would build
a house there,       how he would fortify it,       how
he would have cannon,       how he would plant,       how
he would sally out, and take the isle of
Muck;       and then he laughed with uncommon
glee, and could hardly leave off."

On leaving Skye the travellers were driven into
Col by a heavy sea. Boswell gives a full account
of it and does not try to hide the fact that he was
badly frightened. But he endeavoured to compose
his mind and sought for something to distract
his terror: "As I saw them all busy doing something,
I asked Col, with much earnestness, what
I could do. He, with a happy readiness, put into
my hand a rope, which was fixed to the top of one
of the masts, and told me to hold it till he bade
me pull. If I had considered the matter, I might
have seen that this could not be of the least service;
but his object was to keep me out of the
way of those who were busy working the vessel,
and at the same time to divert my fear, by employing
me, and making me think that I was of
use. Thus did I stand firm to my post, while the
wind and rain beat upon me, always expecting a
call to pull my rope....

[Pg 138]

At last they spied the harbour of Lochiern,
and Col cried, 'Thank God, we are safe!'"

Johnson lay on one of the beds and "having
got free from sickness, was satisfied." This is how
he described the voyage to Mrs Thrale:

"After having been detained by storms many
days at Sky, we left it, as we thought, with a fair
wind; but a violent gust, which Bos had a great
mind to call a tempest, forced us into Col."

Boswell was delighted by his friend's sympathy
with Highland life:

"Sunday, October 17.

Dr Johnson here [at Inchkenneth] shewed so
much of the spirit of a Highlander, that he won
Sir Allan's heart: indeed he has shewn it during
the whole of our Tour. One night, in Col, he
strutted about the room with a broad sword and
target, and made a formidable appearance; and,
another night, I took the liberty to put a large
blue bonnet on his head."

But to be mistaken for a Scotchman was past
a joke:

"Thursday, October 21.

After a very tedious ride ... we arrived, between
seven and eight o'clock, at Moy, the seat of the
Laird of Lochbuy.... Lochbuy proved to be only a
bluff, comely, noisy old gentleman, proud of his
hereditary consequence, and a very hearty and
hospitable landlord. Lady Lochbuy was sister to
Sir Allan M'Lean, but much older.... Being told
that Dr Johnson did not hear well, Lochbuy
bawled out to him, 'Are you of the Johnstons of
Glencro, or of Ardnamurchan?' Dr Johnson gave
[Pg 139]
him a significant look, but made no answer; and
I told Lochbuy that he was not Johnston, but
Johnson, and that he was an Englishman."


  
  Boswell holding firm to his post
  

      


  
  Whiggism terribly buffeted
  

Both Boswell and Johnson found it comfortable
to be on the mainland again:

"Saturday, October 23.

We got at night to Inverary, where we found
an excellent inn. Even here, Dr Johnson would
not change his wet clothes. The prospect of good
accommodation cheered us much. We supped
well; and after supper, Dr Johnson, whom I had
not seen taste any fermented liquor during all
our travels, called for a gill of whiskey. 'Come,
(said he,) let me know what it is that makes a
Scotchman happy!' He drank it all but a drop,
which I begged leave to pour into my glass, that
I might say we had drunk whisky together. I proposed
Mrs Thrale should be our toast. He would
not have her drunk in whisky, but rather 'some
insular lady'; so we drank one of the ladies
whom we had lately left."


"Thursday, October 28.

On our arrival at the Saracen's Head Inn, at
Glasgow ... Dr Johnson ... enjoyed in imagination
the comforts which we could now command, and
seemed to be in high glee. I remember, he put
a leg up on each side of the grate, and said, with
a mock solemnity, by way of soliloquy, but loud
enough for me to hear it 'Here am I, an English
man, sitting by a coal fire.'"

After being entertained by the university professors
at Glasgow, the travellers arrived in a
few days' time at Auchinleck. Boswell was very
[Pg 140]
nervous about the meeting between his father and
Dr Johnson. Lord Auchinleck was a Whig and
Presbyterian and commonly referred to Johnson
as 'a Jacobite fellow.' Johnson promised to avoid
awkward subjects of conversation, and all went
well for a time; but politics cropped up at length
and, to Boswell's distress, "Whiggism and Presbyterianism,
Toryism and Episcopacy, were terribly
buffeted."

"Monday, November 8.

Notwithstanding the altercation that had
passed, my father, who had the dignified courtesy
of an old Baron, was very civil to Dr Johnson,
and politely attended him to the post-chaise,
which was to convey us to Edinburgh. Thus they
parted. They are now in another, and a higher,
state of existence: and as they were both worthy
Christian men, I trust they have met in happiness.
But I must observe, in justice to my friend's political
principles, and my own, that they have met
in a place where there is no room for Whiggism...."

"Tuesday, November 9.

 ... We arrived this night at Edinburgh, after
an absence of eighty-three days. For five weeks
together, of the tempestuous season, there had
been no account received of us. I cannot express
how happy I was on finding myself again at
home."

Johnson stayed at Edinburgh for a fortnight
and then returned to London "without any incommodity,
danger, or weariness."

The expedition to the Hebrides, he said, was
the most pleasant journey he ever made.


[Pg 141]



Lesser Journeys


Two years after his tour to the Hebrides,
Johnson went to France with Mr and Mrs
Thrale. It was in the days before, though not
long before, the Revolution; and Johnson, who
saw Louis XVI and his queen, noted various little
points about them       how the king fed himself
with his left hand and how the queen, wearing
a brown habit, rode 'aside' on a light grey horse.

He saw the sights of Paris and sometimes felt
lonely in doing so:

"The sight of palaces, and other great buildings,
leaves no very distinct images, unless to those who
talk of them. As I entered [the Palais Bourbon],
my wife was in my mind: she would have been
pleased. Having now nobody to please, I am little
pleased."

Besides Paris, which he found "not so fertile
of novelty" as the Hebrides, he visited Rouen,
Fontainebleau, Versailles, Chantilly, and Compiègne,
and admired the cathedrals of Noyon and
Cambrai.

People interested him more than places and he
summed up a few of his impressions of the French
to Boswell:

"The great in France live very magnificently,
but the rest very miserably. There is no happy
middle state as in England.... The French are an
[Pg 142]
indelicate people; they will spit upon any place.
At Madame               's, a literary lady of rank, the
footman took the sugar in his fingers, and threw
it into my coffee. I was going to put it aside;
but hearing it was made on purpose for me, I e'en
tasted Tom's fingers[32].
The same lady would needs
make tea à l'Angloise. The spout of the tea-pot
did not pour freely; she had the footman blow
into it. France is worse than Scotland in everything
but climate."

This was Johnson's only foreign tour. Though
he often talked of expeditions to other countries
of Europe, he was generally content with a post-chaise
on an English road and a friend's house
or a tavern at the end of it.

On March 19, 1776 he met Boswell at the
Somerset coffee-house in the Strand, where they
were taken up by the Oxford coach. In his old
college his thoughts wandered back to his early
days:

"We walked with Dr Adams into the master's
garden, and into the common room. Johnson.
(after a reverie of meditation,) 'Ay! Here I used
to play at draughts with Phil. Jones and Fluyder.
Jones loved beer, and did not get very forward in
the church. Fluyder turned out a scoundrel, a
Whig....' Boswell. 'Was he a scoundrel, Sir,
in any other way than that of being a political
scoundrel? Did he cheat at draughts?' Johnson.
'Sir, we never played for money.'"

[Pg 143]

"Next morning ... we set out in a post-chaise to
pursue our ramble. It was a delightful day, and
we rode through Blenheim Park.... I observed to
him, while in the midst of the noble scene around
us 'You and I, Sir, have, I think, seen together
the extremes of what can be seen in Britain:       the
wild rough island of Mull, and Blenheim Park.'
We dined at an excellent inn at Chapel-house,
where he expatiated on the felicity of England
in its taverns and inns.... 'There is no private
house, (said he,) in which people can enjoy themselves
so well, as at a capital tavern.... The master
of the house is anxious to entertain his guests;
the guests are anxious to be agreeable to him:
and no man, but a very impudent dog indeed, can
as freely command what is in another man's house,
as if it were his own. Whereas, at a tavern, there
is a general freedom from anxiety. You are sure
you are welcome: and the more noise you make,
the more trouble you give, the more good things
you call for, the welcomer you are. No servants
will attend you with the alacrity which waiters do,
who are incited by the prospect of an immediate
reward in proportion as they please. No, Sir;
there is nothing which has yet been contrived by
man, by which so much happiness is produced as
by a good tavern or inn.'"

"On Friday, March 22, having set out early
from Henley, where we had lain the preceding
night, we arrived at Birmingham about nine
o'clock and, after breakfast, went to call on his
old schoolfellow Mr Hector. A very stupid maid,
who opened the door, told us, that 'her master was
[Pg 144]
gone out....' He said to her, 'My name is Johnson;
tell him I called. Will you remember the
name?' She answered with rustick simplicity, in
the Warwickshire pronunciation, 'I don't understand
you, Sir.'       'Blockhead, (said he,) I'll write.'
I never heard the word blockhead applied to a
woman before, though I do not see why it should
not, when there is evident occasion for it. He,
however, made another attempt to make her
understand him, and roared loud in her ear, 'Johnson,'
and then she catched the sound."

However, they met Mr Hector in the street
and Boswell rejoiced to see the two old friends
together. Indeed, he would have liked to prolong
their stay in Birmingham in order to get more
information about Johnson's early life, but Johnson
himself was "impatient to reach his native
city."

"We drove on ... in the dark, and were long
pensive and silent. When we came within the
focus of the Lichfield lamps, 'Now (said he,) we
are getting out of a state of death.' We put up
at the Three Crowns, not one of the great inns,
but a good old fashioned one, which was ... the
very next house to that in which Johnson was
born.... We had a comfortable supper, and got
into high spirits. I felt all my Toryism glow in
this old capital of Staffordshire.... I indulged in
libations of ale."

At Lichfield Boswell met many old friends of
Johnson       Mrs Lucy Porter, his step-daughter,
Mr Peter Garrick, brother of the actor, Mr Seward,
and others. Johnson "expatiated in praise"
[Pg 145]
of the city and its inhabitants, but it appeared to
Boswell that there was "very little business going
forward."

"'Surely, Sir, (said I,) you are an idle set of
people.' 'Sir, (said Johnson,) we are a city of philosophers,
we work with our heads, and make the
boobies of Birmingham work for us with their
hands.'"

From Lichfield they set out for Ashbourne,
in Derbyshire, the home of another old schoolfellow
of Johnson's       the Rev. Dr Taylor.

"There came for us an equipage properly suited
to a well-beneficed clergyman;       Dr Taylor's
large roomy post-chaise, drawn by four stout
plump horses, and driven by two steady jolly
postillions, which conveyed us to Ashbourne....
Dr Taylor ... was a diligent justice of the peace,
and presided over the town of Ashbourne.... His
size, and figure, and countenance, and manner,
were that of a hearty English 'Squire, with the parson
super-induced: and I took particular notice
of his upper servant, Mr Peters, a decent grave
man, in purple clothes, and a large white wig,
like the butler or major domo of a Bishop."

Boswell wondered at the intimacy between
Johnson and Taylor. For Taylor was a Whig and
chiefly occupied with country pursuits. His talk
was of bullocks and his habits "not sufficiently
clerical" to please Johnson. But Johnson, who
wrote a good many sermons for him, had hopes
of being his heir; and with the memory of his
long years of poverty fresh in his mind, he could
not neglect such a hope. Quite apart from this,
[Pg 146]
Johnson never lost his affection for the friends of
his youth and it was to Dr Taylor that he first
turned after the death of his
wife[33]. But neither
life-long friendship nor hope of a legacy hindered
him from "roaring down" his host.

Thus, on another visit to Ashbourne:

"Dr Taylor's nose happening to bleed, he said,
it was because he had omitted to have himself
blooded four days after a quarter of a year's interval.
Dr Johnson, who was a great dabbler in
physick, disapproved much of periodical bleeding....
'I do not like to take an emetick, (said
Taylor,) for fear of breaking some small vessels.'       'Poh!
(said Johnson,) if you have so many
things that will break, you had better break your
neck at once, and there's an end on't. You will
break no small vessels:' (blowing with high
derision.)"

Even on the subject of bull-dogs he had the
last word:

"Taylor, who praised everything of his own
to excess, ... expatiated on the excellence of his
bull-dog, which, he told us, was 'perfectly well
shaped.' Johnson, after examining the animal
attentively, thus repressed the vain-glory of our
host:       'No, Sir, he is not well shaped; for there
is not the quick transition from the thickness of
the fore-part, to the tenuity       the thin part       behind,       which
a bull-dog ought to have.' ... Taylor
said, a small bull-dog was as good as a large one.
Johnson. 'No, Sir; for, in proportion to his
size, he has strength: and your argument would
[Pg 147]
prove, that a good bull-dog may be as small as a
mouse.'"

Johnson found life rather dull at Ashbourne
and often had a day's outing with Boswell:

"After breakfast Dr Johnson and I set out in
Dr Taylor's chaise to go to Derby. The day was
fine, and we resolved to go by Keddlestone, the
seat of Lord Scarsdale.... I was struck with the
magnificence of the building; and the extensive
park, with the finest verdure, covered with deer,
and cattle, and sheep, delighted me.... 'One should
think (said I) that the proprietor of all this must
be happy.'       'Nay, Sir, (said Johnson,) all this
excludes but one evil       poverty.'"

Lord Scarsdale himself appeared, to do "the
honours of the house."

"In his Lordship's dressing-room lay Johnson's
small Dictionary[34]:
he shewed it to me, with some
eagerness, saying 'Look'ye! Quae terra nostri
non plena laboris.' He observed, also, Goldsmith's
Animated Nature; and said, 'Here's our friend!
The poor Doctor would have been happy to hear
of this.' In our way, Johnson strongly expressed
his love of driving fast in a post-chaise. 'If (said
he) I had no duties, and no reference to futurity,
I would spend my life in driving briskly in a post-chaise
with a pretty woman; but she should be
one who could understand me, and would add
something to the conversation.'"

In the year following this visit to Ashbourne,
1778, there was fear of invasion. Our army was
[Pg 148]
fully occupied in the war with America and it was
thought that France and Spain might seize the
opportunity to make an attack upon England.
The militia was called out and Bennet Langton
was stationed with the Lincolns at Warley Camp.
He invited Johnson to visit him there, and Johnson
staid about a week, shewing, as he had done
at Fort George, a keen interest in military
matters:

"He sate, with a patient degree of attention,
to observe the proceedings of a regimental court-martial,
that happened to be called, in the time
of his stay with us; and one night, as late as eleven
o'clock, he accompanied the Major of the regiment
in going what are styled the Rounds, where
he might observe the forms of visiting the guards,
for the seeing that they and their sentries are
ready in their duty.... On one occasion, when the
regiment were going through their exercise, he
went quite close to the men at one of the extremities
of it, and watched all their practices attentively;
and, when he came away, his remark was,
'The men indeed do load their muskets and fire
with wonderful celerity.'"

At the age of 69 he slept in a tent, and enjoyed
himself both at the regimental mess and at dinner
with the General.

"A camp" he wrote to Mrs Thrale "however
familiarly we may speak of it, is one of the great
scenes of human life. War and peace divide the
business of the world. Camps are the habitations
of those who conquer kingdoms, or defend
them."

[Pg 149]

Finally, we must not omit a special journey to
Uttoxeter. Johnson had a long memory, even for
his own failings:

"Once," said he "I refused to attend my father
to Uttoxeter-market. Pride was the source of
that refusal, and the remembrance of it was painful....
I desired to atone for this fault; I went to
Uttoxeter in very bad weather, and stood for a
considerable time bareheaded in the rain, on the
spot where my father's stall used to stand. In
contrition I stood, and I hope the penance was
expiatory."

FOOTNOTES:



[32] It is curious that Johnson, who was not exactly delicate in his
manner of eating (see p. 64), should be greatly upset by this. But he
complained of the same thing of a waiter in Edinburgh.



[33] See p. 45.



[34] Johnson produced an abridged edition in 1756.




The True-Born Englishman


For all his love of a post-chaise, Johnson was
happiest in London. "You yourself, Sir,"
said Boswell when they were in the Hebrides
"have never seen, till now, any thing but your
native island." "Johnson. 'But, Sir, by seeing
London, I have seen as much of life as the world
can shew.' Boswell. 'You have not seen Pekin.'
Johnson. 'What is Pekin? Ten thousand Londoners
would drive all the people of Pekin: they
would drive them like deer.'"

The town, he said, was his element. He rejoiced
in the "animated appearance" of Fleet
Street and "the full tide of life" at Charing Cross,
[Pg 150]
not so much because he loved shops and pavements
better than fields and hedgerows, as because
London held his friends, his books, and his amusements.
Boswell once suggested that he himself
might grow tired of the city if he lived continuously
in it:

"Johnson. 'Why, Sir, you find no man, at all
intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No,
Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired
of life; for there is in London all that life can
afford'"; and to the very end he found that
"such conversation as London affords, could be
found nowhere else."

So, in his last illness in November 1784, he
came to London to die. A month later he was
buried in Westminster Abbey; Edmund Burke
and Bennet Langton helped to bear the pall
and Dr Taylor read the service. His monument,
which Reynolds did not wish to see in the overcrowded
Abbey, was erected in St Paul's Cathedral,
and it is fitting that the nation's memorial of Dr
Johnson should be within sound of Fleet Street.

If London meant life to Johnson, it meant the
life of England. His prejudice against foreigners
was of the old-fashioned kind:

"Like the ancient Greeks and Romans, he
allowed himself to look upon all nations but his
own as barbarians.... If he was particularly prejudiced
against the Scots, it was because they were
more in his way; because he thought their success
in England rather exceeded the due proportion
of their real merit.... He was indeed, if I may be
[Pg 151]
allowed the phrase, much of a John Bull; much
of a blunt true born Englishman."


  
  Fleet Street in Johnson's day
  

His hatred of the Whigs was life-long and
violent       the first Whig, he said, was the Devil;
but whatever may be thought of his political
opinions, there can be no doubt of his patriotism.
What did he mean by a patriot
[35]? Here is his
definition:

"A patriot is he whose publick conduct is
regulated by one single motive, the love of his
country; who, as an agent in parliament, has for
himself neither hope nor fear, neither kindness
nor resentment, but refers everything to the common
interest. A true patriot is no lavish promiser;
he undertakes not to shorten parliament, to repeal
laws.... Much less does he make a vague and
indefinite promise of obeying the mandates of his
constituents.... He considers himself as deputed
to promote the publick good, and to preserve his
constituents, with the rest of his countrymen,
not only from being hurt by others, but from
hurting themselves."

Johnson had no patience with a popular cry for
liberty, such as was raised by the crowds that
rallied round John Wilkes. "They make a
rout" he said "about universal liberty, without
considering that all that is to be valued, or indeed
can be enjoyed by individuals, is private liberty."

Sir Adam Fergusson, a Scotch member of
[Pg 152]
parliament, once suggested that luxury corrupts
a people and destroys the spirit of liberty:

"Johnson. 'Sir, that is all visionary. I would
not give half a guinea to live under one form of
government rather than another. It is of no
moment to the happiness of an individual.' ...
Sir Adam. 'But, Sir, in the British constitution
it is surely of importance to keep up a spirit in
the people, so as to preserve a balance against
the crown.' Johnson. 'Sir, I perceive you are a
vile Whig. Why all this childish jealousy of the
power of the crown? The crown has not power
enough. When I say that all governments are
alike, I consider that in no government power
can be abused long. Mankind will not bear it.
If a sovereign oppresses his people to a great
degree, they will rise and cut off his head.'"

It was his contempt for political liberty that
made him vehemently support the losing side in
the American War. He regarded the colonists as
rebels and Taxation no Tyranny was the title of
a pamphlet he wrote in support of the king's
cause.

But what specially enraged him was that
the cry of "liberty" should be raised by slave-owners.
"How is it" he asked "that we hear
the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of
negroes?"

Nearly fifty years before the abolition of slavery
was first discussed in Parliament, Johnson had
maintained "the natural right of the negroes to
liberty and independence." "An individual" he
said "may, indeed, forfeit his liberty by a crime;
[Pg 153]
but he cannot by that crime forfeit the liberty of
his children."

Johnson's loyalty to the Crown was strengthened
by an interview he had with George III in
1767. It was in the library at the Queen's house
[36]:

"His Majesty enquired if he was then writing
any thing.... Johnson said, he thought he had already
done his part as a writer. 'I should have
thought so too, (said the King,) if you had not
written so well.'       Johnson observed to me, upon
this, that 'No man could have paid a handsomer
compliment; and it was fit for a King to pay. It
was decisive.' When asked by another friend, at
Sir Joshua Reynolds's, whether he made any reply
to this high compliment, he answered, 'No, Sir.
When the King had said it, it was to be so. It was
not for me to bandy civilities with my Sovereign.'"

Had he so chosen, Johnson might have entered
Parliament. To the friends of the king, it was
urged, he would be found a lamb, to his enemies
a lion.

But Johnson knew that he was better fitted to
be a public oracle in Fleet Street than to catch the
Speaker's eye at Westminster.

A true-born Englishman, he extolled the English
virtues of honesty and courage. Of the
'English common soldier' he wrote:

"Our nation may boast, beyond any other people
in the world, of a kind of epidemick bravery, diffused
equally through all its ranks. We can shew
[Pg 154]
a peasantry of heroes, and fill our armies with
clowns, whose courage may vie with that of their
general."

"Sir," he said at another time "you know
courage is reckoned the greatest of all virtues;
because, unless a man has that virtue, he has no
security for preserving any other."

He himself had no small measure of it. True,
he had an "aweful dread of death, or rather 'of
something after death,'" but "he feared nothing
else, not even what might occasion death":

"One day ... when two large dogs were fighting,
he went up to them, and beat them till they
separated; and at another time, when told of the
danger there was that a gun might burst if
charged with many balls, he put in six or seven,
and fired it off against a wall.... He told me himself
that one night he was attacked in the street
by four men, to whom he would not yield, but
kept them all at bay, till the watch came up, and
carried both him and them to the round-house.
In the play-house at Lichfield, as Mr Garrick informed
me, Johnson having for a moment quitted
a chair which was placed for him between the
side-scenes, a gentleman took possession of it,
and when Johnson on his return civilly demanded
his seat, rudely refused to give it up; upon which
Johnson laid hold of it, and tossed him and the
chair into the pit."

Certainly Boswell may be allowed the phrase
"much of a John Bull."

Honesty of heart, truth in the inward parts,
was with Johnson the one thing needful.

[Pg 155]

To him no fraud could be innocent; the security
of human society depended on truth and
was weakened by a man whose words were at variance
with his practice.

"Every man" he said (and here John Bull
spoke again) "has a right to utter what he thinks
truth and every other man has a right to knock
him down for it."

To stretch a point in talking, in the use of a
conventional phrase, did not matter. Common
politeness, or the course of argument might demand
it. Did he not himself often 'talk for
victory'?

What he insisted on was that men should not
deceive themselves and others by thinking foolishly.
"Clear your mind" he said "of cant."

"Such," to quote Boswell for the last time,
"was Samuel Johnson." Though he was the
foremost man of letters of his generation, it is
not for his scholarship or his writings, but rather
for his pluck and his patriotism, his humour and
his oddities, his blunt common-sense and his large
humanity, and, above all, for the expression of
these qualities in his talk, that he is best loved
and remembered. For to appreciate Johnson's
talk one need not be literary; it is enough to be
English.

[Pg 156]


FOOTNOTES:




[35]
When he made the often-quoted remark 'Patriotism is the last
refuge of a scoundrel' Johnson was referring to 'patriots' only in the
party sense, to those who made patriotism a "cloak for self-interest."

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE


Boswell's Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides was published
in 1785 and reached a sixth edition in 1813.

Many of the later editors of Boswell have included
the Tour in their editions of the Life.

It is published as a separate volume in Dent's Temple
Classics, with a few notes by Arnold Glover (1898) and
is contained in a volume of Dent's Everyman's Library.

The Life appeared in two quarto volumes in 1791
and went through ten editions before the much-criticised
edition of J. W. Croker in 1831. The sixth
edition, 1811, edited by Malone, is the safest of the
early editions. It is not disfigured by the liberties
which Croker took with Boswell's text.

Later editions are almost innumerable.

Napier's edition of 1884 included some valuable new
material, but the incomparable edition for students is
that of George Birkbeck Hill, published by the Oxford
University Press in 1887. It is in six volumes, of which
four contain the Life, one the Tour, and one the monumental
index to which every student of Johnson must
pay his debt of gratitude.

Among modern editions the following may be
noted:

Arnold Glover: 6 volumes (text of 1811), annotated.
Dent. 1901.

Roger Ingpen: 2 volumes, illustrated. Pitman.
1907.

Among the cheapest and handiest modern reprints
are:

The Oxford edition. (Two volumes; or, on India
paper, in one volume.)

The Globe edition. (One volume; double columns
of print. Macmillan.)

The Everyman edition. (Two volumes. Dent.)
[Pg 157]
The contemporary authorities for Johnson's life,
other than Boswell, are Sir John Hawkins's Life, Mrs
Piozzi's Anecdotes, Fanny Burney's Diary, and anecdotes
by many others.

Most of these were collected by the late Dr Birkbeck
Hill in his two volumes of Johnsonian Miscellanies (Oxford,
1897); two volumes of Johnson's Letters were also
published by the same editor in 1892.

Of modern criticism on Johnson the following may
be recommended:

Lord Macaulay: Boswell's Life of Johnson. 1831.

Article on Johnson in the Encyclopaedia Britannica,
1856.

Thomas Carlyle: Boswell's Life of Johnson. 1832.

Sir Leslie Stephen: Samuel Johnson. (English Men
of Letters series. Macmillan, 1878.)

G. B. Hill: Dr Johnson, His Friends and His Critics.
(1878.)

Sir Walter Raleigh: Six Essays on Johnson. (Oxford,
1910.)

Lieut.-Col. F. Grant: Life and Writings of Samuel
Johnson, with a bibliography by J. P. Anderson. (Great
Writers series. Walter Scott Co.)

Johnson's Collected Works, of which there were many
editions, e.g. the Oxford edition (Works, 9 vols, Debates,
2 vols, 1825), are easily obtainable second-hand, as are
also The Lives of the Poets and The Rambler.

The Lives of the Poets and Rasselas were edited with
notes by Dr Birkbeck Hill for the Oxford University
Press.

Johnson's Poems, together with the poetry of Goldsmith,
Gray, and Collins, are published in a handy form,
with introduction and notes by Colonel T. Methuen
Ward, in the Muses' Library series (Routledge, 1905).



A Bibliography of Samuel Johnson, by W. P. Courtney,
was published by the Oxford University Press in 1915.

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit  a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
