NOTICE TO PARENTS.

Although this little book, and its fellow, "ROLLO AT WORK," are
intended principally as a means of entertainment for their little
readers, it is hoped by the writer that they may aid in
accomplishing some of the following useful purposes:&mdash;
1. In cultivating the thinking powers; as frequent
occasions occur, in which the incidents of the narrative, and the
conversations arising from them, are intended to awaken and engage
the reasoning and reflective faculties of the little readers.
2. In promoting the progress of children in reading and
in knowledge of language; for the diction of the stories is
intended to be often in advance of the natural language of the
reader, and yet so used as to be explained by the connection.
3. In cultivating the amiable and gentle qualities of the
heart. The scenes are laid in quiet and virtuous life, and the
character and conduct described are generally&mdash;with the
exception of some of the ordinary exhibitions of childish
folly&mdash;character and conduct to be imitated; for it is
generally better, in dealing with children, to allure them to what
is right by agreeable pictures of it, than to attempt to drive them
to it by repulsive delineations of what is wrong.

ROLLO AT PLAY IN THE WOODS.









THE SETTING OUT.
One pleasant morning in the autumn, when Rollo was about five
years old, he was sitting on the platform, behind his father's
house, playing. He had a hammer and nails, and some small pieces of
board. He was trying to make a box. He hammered and hammered, and
presently he dropped his work down and said, fretfully,
"O dear me!"
"What is the matter, Rollo?" said Jonas,&mdash;for it happened
that Jonas was going by just then, with a wheelbarrow.
"I wish these little boards would not split so. I cannot make my
box."
"You drive the nails wrong; you put the wedge sides with
the grain."
"The wedge sides!" said Rollo; "what are the wedge
sides,&mdash;and the grain? I do not know what you mean."
But Jonas went on, trundling his wheelbarrow; though he looked
round and told Rollo that he could not stop to explain it to him
then.
Rollo was discouraged about his box. He thought he would look
and see what Jonas was going to do. Jonas trundled the wheelbarrow
along, until he came opposite the barn-door, and there he put it
down. He went into the barn, and presently came out with an axe.
Then he took the sides of the wheelbarrow off, and placed them up
against the barn. Then he laid the axe down across the wheelbarrow,
and went into the barn again. Pretty soon he brought out an iron
crowbar, and laid that down also in the wheelbarrow, with the
axe.
Then Rollo called out,
"Jonas, Jonas, where are you going?"
"I am going down into the woods beyond the brook."
"What are you going to do?"
"I am going to clear up some ground."
"May I go with you?"
"I should like it&mdash;but that is not for me to say."
Rollo knew by this that he must ask his mother. He went in and
asked her, and she, in return, asked him if he had read his lesson
that morning. He said he had not; he had forgotten it.
"Then," said his mother, "you must first go and read a quarter
of an hour."
Rollo was sadly disappointed, and also a little displeased. He
turned away, hung down his head, and began to cry. It is not
strange that he was disappointed, but it was very wrong for him to
feel displeased, and begin to cry.
"Come here, my son," said his mother.
Rollo came to his mother, and she said to him kindly,
"You have done wrong now twice this morning; you have neglected
your duty of reading, and now you are out of humor with me because
I require you to attend to it. Now it is my duty not to
yield to such feelings as you have now, but to punish them. So I
must say that, instead of a quarter of an hour, you must wait
half an hour, before you go out with Jonas."
Rollo stood silent a minute,&mdash;he perceived that he had done
wrong, and was sorry. He did not know how he could find Jonas in
the woods, but he did not say any thing about that then. He only
asked his mother what he must do for the half hour. She said he
must read a quarter of an hour, and the rest of the time he might
do as he pleased.
So Rollo took his book, and went out and sat down upon the
platform, and began to read aloud. When he had finished one page,
which usually took a quarter of an hour, he went in to ask his
mother what time it was. She looked at the clock, and told him he
had been reading seventeen minutes.
"Is seventeen minutes more than a quarter of an hour, or not so
much?" asked Rollo.
"It is more;&mdash;fifteen minutes is a quarter of an
hour. Now you may do what you please till the other quarter has
elapsed."
Rollo thought he would go and read more. It is true he was
tired; but he was sorry he had done wrong, and he thought that if
he read more than he was obliged to, his mother would see that he
was penitent, and that he acquiesced in his punishment.
So he went on reading, and the rest of the half hour passed away
very quickly. In fact, his mother came out before he got up from
his reading, to tell him it was time for him to go. She said she
was very glad he had submitted pleasantly to his punishment, and
she gave him something wrapped up in a paper.
"Keep this till you get a little tired of play, down there, and
then sit down on a log and open it."
Rollo wondered what it was. He took it gladly, and began to go.
But in a minute he turned round and said,
"But how shall I find Jonas?"
"What is he doing?" said his mother.
"He said he was going to clear up some land."
"Then you will hear his axe. Go down to the edge of the woods
and listen, and when you hear him, call him. But you must not go
into the woods unless you hear him."






BRIDGE BUILDING.
Rollo went on, down the green lane, till he came to the
turn-stile, and then went through into the field. He then followed
a winding path until he came to the edge of the trees, and there
stopped to listen.
He heard the brook gurgling along over the stones, and that was
all at first; but presently he began to hear the strokes of an axe.
He called out as loud as he could,
"Jonas! Jonas!"
But Jonas did not hear.
Then he walked along the edge of the woods till he came nearer
the place where he heard the axe. He found here a little opening
among the trees and bushes, so that he could look in. He saw the
brook, and over beyond it, on the opposite bank, was Jonas, cutting
down a small tree.
So Rollo walked on until he came to the brook, and then asked
Jonas how he should get over. The brook was pretty wide and
deep.
Jonas said, if he would wait a few minutes, he would build him a
bridge.
"You cannot build a bridge," said Rollo.
"Wait a little and see."
So Rollo sat down on a mossy bank, and Jonas, having cut down
the small tree, began to work on a larger one that stood near the
bank.
After he had cut a little while, Rollo asked him why he did not
begin the bridge.
"I am beginning it," said he.
Rollo laughed at this, but in a minute Jonas called to him to
stand back, away from the bank; and then, after a few strokes more,
the top of the tree began to bend slowly over, and then it fell
faster and faster, until it came down with a great crash, directly
across the brook.
"There!" said Jonas, "there is your bridge."
Rollo looked at it with astonishment and pleasure.
"Now," said Jonas, "I will come and help you over."
"No," said Rollo, "I can come over myself. I can take hold of
the branches for a railing."
So Rollo began to climb along the stem of the tree, holding on
carefully by the branches. When he reached the middle of the
stream, he stopped to look down into the water.
"This is a capital bridge of yours, Jonas,"
said he. "How beautiful the water looks down here! O, I see a
little fish! He is swimming along by a great rock. Now he is
standing perfectly still. O, Jonas, come and see him."
"No," said Jonas, "I must mind my work."
After a little time, Rollo went carefully on over the bridge,
and sat down on the bank of the brook. But he did not have with him
the parcel his mother gave him. He had left it on the other
side.
After he had watched the fishes, and thrown pebble-stones into
the brook some time, he began to be tired, and he asked Jonas what
he had better do.
"I think you had better build a wigwam."
"A wigwam? What is a wigwam?" said Rollo.
"It is a little house made of bushes such as the Indians live
in."
"O, I could not make a house," said Rollo.
"I think you could if I should tell you how, and help you a
little."
"But you say you must mind your work."
"Yes,&mdash;I can mind my work and tell you at the same
time."
Rollo thought he should like to build a wigwam very much. Jonas
told him the first thing to be done was to find a good place, where
the ground was level. Rollo looked at a good many places, but at
last chose a smooth spot under a great oak tree, which Jonas said
he was not going to cut down. It was near a beautiful turn in the
brook, where the water was very deep.
Jonas told him that the first thing was to make a little stake,
and drive it down in the middle of his wigwam-ground. Then Rollo
recollected that he had left his hatchet over on the other side of
the brook, together with the parcel his mother gave him; and he was
going over to get them, when Jonas told him he would trim up the
bridge a little, and then he could go over more easily.
So Jonas went upon the bridge, and began to cut away the
branches that were in the way, leaving enough on each side to take
hold of, and to keep Rollo from falling in. Rollo could then go
back and forth easily. He held on with one hand, and carried his
hatchet in the other. Then he went over again, and brought his
parcel, and laid it down near the great oak tree.
Then he made a little stake, and drove it down in the middle of
the wigwam-ground. Then he asked Jonas what he must do next.
"That is the centre of your wigwam; now you must strike a circle
around it."
"What?" said Rollo.
"Don't you know how to strike a circle?" said Jonas.
Rollo said he did not, and then Jonas told him to do exactly as
he should say, and that would show him.
"First," said Jonas, "have you got a string?"
Rollo felt in his pockets in vain, but he recollected his little
parcel, which was tied with a piece of twine, and held it up to ask
Jonas if that would do. Jonas said it would, and told him to take
it off carefully, and tie one end of it to his centre stake.
And Rollo did so.
"Now," said Jonas, "make another little sharp stake for the
marker, and tie the other end of the twine to that, near the sharp
end."
Rollo worked busily for some time, and then called out,
"Jonas, it is done."
All this time, Jonas was at work in the bushes, at a little
distance. He now came to Rollo's wigwam-ground, and took hold of
the marker, and held it off as far from the middle stake as it
would go, and then began to make a mark on the ground all around
the middle stake. Now, as the marker was tied to the middle stake
by the string, the mark was equally distant from the middle stake
in every part, and that made it exactly round. Then Jonas laid down
the marker, and pulled out the middle stake; and they looked down
and saw that there was a round mark on the ground, about as large
as a cart-wheel.
Then Jonas took the crowbar, and made deep holes all around, in
this circle, so far apart that Rollo could just step from one to
the other. But Rollo could not understand how he could make a house
so.
"I will tell you," said Jonas. "You must now go and get some
large branches of trees, and trim off the twigs from the lower end,
and stick them down in these, holes. I will show you how."
So Jonas took a large bough, and trimmed the large end, and
sharpened it a little, and then he fixed it down in one of these
holes, in such a manner that the top of it bent over towards the
middle of the circle; then he went back to his work, leaving Rollo
to go on with the wigwam.






A VISITOR.
Rollo put down two or three branches very well, and was very
much delighted at seeing it gradually begin to look like a house,
when he thought he heard a voice. He listened a moment, and heard
some one at a distance calling, "Rol&mdash;lo. Rol&mdash;lo."
Rollo dropped his hatchet, and looked in the direction that the
sound came from, and called out as loud as he could, "What!"
"Where&mdash;are&mdash;you?" was heard in reply.
Rollo answered, "Here," and then immediately clambered
along over the bridge, and ran through the woods until he came out
into the open field; and there he saw a small boy, away off at a
distance, just coming through the turn-stile.
It was his cousin James. It seems that James had come to play
with him that day, and Rollo's mother had directed him down towards
the woods.
James came running along towards Rollo, holding up something
round and bright, in each hand. They were half dollars.
"Where did you get them?" said Rollo.
"One is for you, and one is for me," said James. "Uncle George
sent them to us."
"What a beautiful little eagle!" said Rollo, as he looked at one
side of his half dollar; "I wish I could get it off and keep it
separate."
"O no," said James, "that would spoil your half dollar."
"Why, they would know it was a half dollar by the letters and
the head on the other side. What a pretty thin eagle! How do you
suppose they fasten it on so strong?"
James said he thought he could get it off; so they went and sat
down on a smooth log, that was lying on the ground, and laid
Rollo's half dollar on the log. Then he took a pin, and tried to
drive the point of it under the eagle's head, with a small stone.
But the eagle would not move. They only made some little marks and
scratches on the silver.
"Never mind," said Rollo; "I will keep it as it is." So he took
his half dollar, and they walked along towards the brook.
They showed their money to Jonas, and told him that they had
tried to get the eagle off. He smiled at this. The boys went back
soon to the wigwam, and James said he would help Rollo finish it.
While they were at work they put their money on a large flat stone,
on the brink of the brook. They fixed a great many boughs into
their wigwam, weaving them in all around, and thus made a very
pleasant little house, leaving a place for a door in front. When
they were tired, they went and opened Rollo's little package, and
found a fine luncheon in it of bread and butter and pie; which they
ate very happily together, sitting on little hemlock branches in
the wigwam.






DIFFICULTY.
After their luncheon, the boys began to talk about the best
place for a window for the wigwam.
"I think we will have it this side, towards the brook,"
said James, "and then we can look out to the water."
"No," said Rollo, "it will be better to have it here,
towards where Jonas is working, and then we can look out and see
him."
"No," said James, "that is not a good plan; I do not want to see
Jonas."
"And I do not want to see the water," replied Rollo. "It is
my wigwam, and I mean to have the window here."
So saying, he went to the side towards Jonas, and began to take
away a bough. James came there too, and said angrily,
"The wigwam is mine as much as it is yours, for I helped make
it, and I will not have a window here."
So he took hold of the branch that Rollo had hold of. They both
felt guilty and condemned, but their angry feelings urged them on,
and they looked fiercely at each other, and pulled upon the
branch.
"Rollo," said James, "let go."
"James," said Rollo, "I tell you, let my wigwam alone."
"It is not your wigwam."
"I tell you it is."
Just then they heard a noise in the bushes. They looked around,
and saw Jonas coming towards them. They felt ashamed, and were
silent, though each kept hold of the branch.
"Now, boys," said Jonas, "you have got into a foolish and wicked
quarrel. I have heard it all. Now you may do as you
please&mdash;you may let me settle it, or I will lead you home to
your mother, and tell her about it, and let her settle it."
The boys looked ashamed, but said nothing.
"If you conclude to let me settle it, you must do just as I say.
But I do not pretend that I have any right to decide such a case,
unless you consent. So I will take you home, if you prefer."
The boys both preferred that he should settle it, and promised
to do as he should say.
"Well, then," said he, "the first thing is for you, Rollo, to go
over the other side of the brook, and you, James, to stay here, and
both to sit down still, until you have had time to cool."
The boys obeyed, and Jonas went back to his work.
The boys sat still, feeling guilty and ashamed; but they were
not penitent. They ought to have been sorry for their fault, and
become good-natured and pleasant again. But instead of that, they
were silent and displeased, eyeing one another across the brook.
Jonas waited some time, and then came and called them both to
him.
"Now," says James, "I will tell you all about it, and you shall
decide who was to blame."
"I heard it all, and I know which was to blame; you, James, came
here to see Rollo, and found him building a wigwam. It was
his wigwam, not yours. He began it without you, and
was going on without you, and when you came, you had no right to
assume any authority about it. You ought to have let him do as he
wished with his own wigwam. You were unjust."
Here Rollo began to look pleased and triumphant, that Jonas had
decided in his favor.
"But," continued Jonas, "you, Rollo, were playing here alone.
Your little cousin came to see you; and you were very glad to have
him come. He helped you build, and when he wanted to have the
window in a particular way, you ought to have let him. To quarrel
with a visitor for such a cause as that, was very ungentlemanly and
unkind. So you see you were both very much to blame."
The boys looked guilty and ashamed, but they did not feel really
penitent. They were not cordially reconciled. Neither was willing
to give up.
"But," said Rollo, "how shall we make the window?"
"I think you ought not to make any window, as you cannot agree
about it."
They wanted to make a window now more than ever, for each wanted
to have his own way; but Jonas would not consent, and as they had
agreed to abide by his decision, they submitted. Jonas then
returned to his work, and the boys stood by the side of the brook,
not knowing exactly what to do. Jonas told them, when they went
away, that he expected that they would have another quarrel, as he
perceived that their hearts were still in a bad state.






HEARTS WRONG.
The boys sat down on the bank of the brook, and began to pick up
little stones and throw them into the water. They began soon to
talk of the window again.
Rollo said, "Jonas thought you were most to blame, I know."
"No, he did not," replied James. "He blamed you the most; he
said you were unjust."
"I don't care," said Rollo. "You do not know how to build a
wigwam. You cannot reach high enough to make a window."
"I can reach high," said James. "I can reach as high as
that," said he, stretching up his hand.
"And I can reach as high as that" said Rollo, stretching
up his hand higher than James did; for he was a little taller.
James was somewhat vexed to find that Rollo could reach higher
than he could, though it was very foolish to allow himself to be
put out of humor by such a thing. But boys, when they are
ill-humored, and dispute, are always unreasonable and foolish.
James determined not to be outdone, so he took up a stick, and
reached it up in the air as high as he could, and said,
"I can reach up as high as that."
Then Rollo took up a stone, and tossed it up into the air,
saying,
"And I can reach as high as that."
Now, when boys throw stones into the air, they ought to consider
where they will come down; but, unfortunately, Rollo did not in
this case, and the stone fell directly upon James's head. It was,
however a small stone, and his cap prevented it from hurting him
much; but he was already vexed and out of humor, and so he began to
cry out aloud.
Rollo was frightened a little, for he was afraid he had hurt his
cousin a good deal, and then he expected too that Jonas would come.
But Jonas took no notice of the crying, but went on with his work.
Now, Jonas was very kind and careful, and always came quick when
there was any one hurt. But this time, he knew by the tone of
James's crying, that it was vexation rather than pain that caused
it.
James, finding that his crying did no good, gradually became
still; and in a few minutes, as he happened to look round, his eye
rested on the stone where they had put their half dollars, and he
saw that only one of them was there.
"O, Rollo," said he, "one of our half dollars is gone."
They went to the stone, and, true enough, one was gone. They
looked around, but it was no where to be found. Boys that are out
of humor with one another, are never at a loss for subjects of
dispute; and Rollo said he believed James had taken it, and James
charged it upon Rollo. Then there was a dispute who should have the
one that was left. James knew it was his; he said he remembered
exactly how his looked; and Rollo knew it was his, for the
head and the stars were very bright on his, and they were very
bright on this. James, however, had the half dollar, and would not
give it up; and so Rollo went to Jonas, and told him that James had
got his half dollar.
Jonas came, and heard the whole story from both of the boys.
James said he knew the one that was left was his, for he
remembered exactly how it looked, and he also remembered exactly
the very spot on the stone where he put it down.
James did not mean to tell a lie, but he was a little angry and
excited, and when boys are in that state of mind, they are very apt
to say they know not what.
Jonas looked at both sides of the half dollar very
attentively.
"Which half dollar was it," said he, "that you tried to get the
eagle off of?"
"Mine," said Rollo; "let me see."
Jonas held down the half dollar, and showed to Rollo and James
the marks and scratches made by the pin; proving that this was
Rollo's half dollar. James looked ashamed and confounded; Jonas
just waited to hear what he would say.






HEARTS RIGHT AGAIN.
James stood still a minute, thinking presently he said,
"Well, Rollo, I suppose my half dollar is lost, but I am glad
yours is safe, at any rate."
"I am sorry yours is lost," said Rollo, "but then I can give you
half of what I buy with mine."
"Where did you put the half dollars?" said Jonas.
"On that rock," said Rollo.
They walked along towards the rock. It was by the edge of the
water; Jonas thought that as they had been dragging boughs of trees
along near the rock, some little branch might have reached over and
brushed off one of the pieces of money into the water. So he walked
up to it and looked over.
In a minute or two, he pointed down, and the boys looked and saw
something bright and glittering on the bottom.
"Is that it?" said James.
"I believe it is," said Jonas.
Jonas then took off his jacket, rolled up his shirt sleeve, lay
down on the rock, and reached his arm down into the water, but it
was a little too deep. He could not reach it.
"I cannot get it so," said he.
"What shall we do?" said James. "How foolish I was to put it so
near the water!"
"I think we shall contrive some way to get it," said Jonas.
He then sat down on the rock and looked into the water. "We can
go home and get a long pair of tongs, and get it with them at any
rate," said he.
"O, yes," said Rollo, "I will go and get them;" and he ran off
towards the bridge.
"No," said Jonas, "stop; I will try one plan more."
So he went and cut a long straight stem of a bush, and trimmed
it up smooth, and cut the largest end off exactly square. Then he
went to a hemlock tree near, and took off some of the gum, which
was very "sticky." He pressed some of this with his knife on the
end of the stick. Then he reached it very carefully down, and
pressed it hard against the half dollar; it crowded the half dollar
down into the sand, out of sight.
"There, you have lost it," said James.
"I don't know," said Jonas; and he began slowly and carefully to
draw it up.

"The boys at the river.">
When the end of the stick came up out of the sand, the boys saw,
to their great delight, that the half dollar was sticking fast on.
They clapped their hands, and capered about on the stone, while
Jonas gently drew up the half dollar, and put it, all wet and
dripping, into James's hand.
The boys thanked Jonas for getting up the money, and then they
asked him to keep both pieces for them until they went home. Then
they began to think of the wigwam again.
"We will make the window as you want it, James," said Rollo; "I
am willing."
"No," said James, "I was just going to say we would make it your
way. I rather think it would be better to make it towards the
land."
"Why can you not have two windows?" said Jonas.
"So we can," said both of the boys; and they immediately went to
work collecting branches and weaving them in, leaving a space for a
window both sides. Their quarrelsome feelings were all gone, and
they talked very pleasantly at their work until it was time for
them to go home to dinner.

THE STEEPLE TRAP.









THE WAY TO CATCH A SQUIRREL.
The afternoon of the day when Rollo and his cousin James made
their wigwam in the woods by the brook, they were at work there
again, employed very harmoniously together, in finishing their
edifice, when suddenly Jonas, who was at work in the woods at a
little distance, heard them both calling to him, in tones of
surprise and pleasure&mdash;
"O, Jonas, Jonas, come here quick&mdash;quick."
Jonas dropped his axe and ran.
When he got near them, they pointed to a log.
"See there;&mdash;see;&mdash;see there."
"What is it?" said Jonas. "O, I see it," said he.
It was a little squirrel clambering up a raspberry-bush, eating
the raspberries as he went along. He would climb up by the little
branches, and pull in the raspberries in succession, until he got
to the topmost one, when the bush would bend over with his weight
until it almost touched the log.
"Let us catch him," said Rollo, very eagerly; "do let us catch
him; I will go and get our steeple trap."
Jonas did not seem to be so very much delighted as the boys
were. He said he was certainly a cunning little fellow, but "what
should we do with him if we should catch him?"
"O," said Rollo, "we would put him in a little cage. It would be
so complete to have him in a cage! Do, Jonas, do."
"But you have not got any cage."
"We can get one," said James. "We can buy one with our half
dollars."
"Well," said Jonas, "it will do no good to set the trap now, for
he will be away before we could get back. But I will come down
to-night, and set the trap, and perhaps we shall catch him, though
I do not exactly like to do it."
"Why?" said the boys.
"O," replied Jonas, "he will not like to be shut up all night,
in a dark box, and then be imprisoned in a cage. He had rather run
about here, and gather raspberries. Besides, you would soon get
tired of him if you had him in a cage."
"O no," said Rollo, "I should not get tired of him."
"Did you ever have any plaything that you were not tired of
before long?"
"Why,&mdash;no," said Rollo; "but then a real live squirrel is a
different thing. Besides, you know, if I get tired of him, I need
not play with him then."
"No, but a real live thing must be fed every day, and
that you would find a great trouble. And then you would
sometimes forget it, and the poor fellow would be half
starved."
"O no," said Rollo; "I am sure I should not forget it."
"Did you remember your reading-lesson this morning?"
"Why,&mdash;no," said Rollo, looking a little confused. "But I
am sure I should not forget to feed a squirrel if I had one."
"You don't know as much as I thought you did," replied
Jonas.
"Why?"
"I thought you knew more about yourself than to suppose you
could be trusted to do any thing regularly every day. Why, you
would not remember to wash your own face every morning, if your
mother did not remind you. The squirrel is almost as fit to take
care of you in your wigwam, as you are to take care of him in a
cage."
Rollo felt a little ashamed of his boasting, for he knew that
what Jonas said was true. Jonas said, finally, "However, we will
try to catch him; but I cannot promise that I shall let you keep
him in a cage. It will be bad enough for him to be shut up all
night in the box trap, but I can pay him for that the next day in
corn."
So Jonas brought down the box trap that night. It was a long
box, about as big as a cricket, with a tall, pointed back, which
looked like a steeple; so Rollo called it the steeple trap. It was
so made that if the squirrel should go in, and begin to nibble some
corn, which they were going to put in there, it would make the
cover come down and shut him in. They fixed the trap on the end of
the log, and Jonas observed, as he sat on the log, that he could
see the barn chamber window through a little opening among the
trees. Of course he knew that from the barn chamber window he could
see the trap, though it would be too far off to see it plain.






THE WAY TO LOSE A SQUIRREL.
Early the next morning, James came over to learn whether they
had caught the squirrel; and he and Rollo wanted Jonas to go down
with them and see. Jonas said he could not go down then very well,
but if he would go and ask his father to lend him his spy-glass, he
could tell without going down.
Now Jonas had been a very faithful and obedient boy, ever since
he came to live with Rollo's father. He had some great faults when
he first came, but he had cured himself of them, and he was now an
excellent and trustworthy boy. It was a part of his business to
take care of Rollo, and they always let him have what he asked for
from the house, as they knew it was for some good purpose, and that
it would be well taken care of. So when Rollo went in and asked for
the spy-glass, and said that Jonas wanted it, they handed it down
to him at once.
Jonas took the glass, and they all three went up into the barn
chamber.
Jonas opened the glass, and held it up to his eye. The boys
stood by looking on silently. At length, Jonas said,
"No, we have not caught him."
"How do you know?" said the boys.
"O, I can see the trap, and it is not sprung."
"Is not sprung?" said James, "what do you mean by
sprung?"
"Shut. It is not shut. I can see it open, and of course the
squirrel is not there."
"O, he may be in," said Rollo, "just nibbling the corn. Do let
us go and see."
Jonas smiled, and said he could not go then, but he would look
through the spy-glass again towards noon. He then gave the glass to
Rollo, and it was carried back safely into the house.
James soon after went home, and Rollo sat down in the parlor to
his reading. Afterwards he came out, and went to building cities in
a sandy corner of the garden. He was making Rome,&mdash;for his
father had told him that Rome was built on seven hills, and he
liked to make the seven hills in the sand. He made a long channel
for an aqueduct, and went into the house to get a dipper of water
to fill his aqueduct, when he met James coming again. So they went
in, and got the spy-glass, and asked Jonas to go up and look
again.
Jonas adjusted the glass, held it up to his eye, and looked some
time in silence, and then said,&mdash;
"Yes, it is sprung, I believe. Yes, it is certainly sprung."
"O, then we have caught him," said the boys, capering about.
"Let us go and see."
"Perhaps we have caught him," said Jonas, "but it is not
certain; sometimes the trap gets sprung accidentally. However, you
may go and ask your father if he thinks it worth while for me to
leave my work long enough to go down and see."
 img id="pic4" src="images/illus4.png" alt=
"Jonas looks through the spy-glass.">
Rollo came back with the permission granted, and they all set
off; Rollo and James running on eagerly before.
When they came to the trap, they found it shut. Jonas took it
up, and tipped it one way and the other, and listened. He heard
something moving in it, but did not know whether it was anything
more than the corn cob. Then he said he would open the trap a very
little, and let Rollo peep in.
He did so. Rollo said it looked all dark; he could not see any
thing. Then Jonas opened it a little farther, and Rollo saw two
little shining eyes, and presently a nose smelling along at the
crack.
"Yes, here he is, here he is," said Rollo; "look at him, James,
look at him;&mdash;see, see."
They all peeped at him, and then Jonas took the box under his
arm, and they returned home.
Jonas told the boys he was not willing to keep the squirrel a
prisoner very long, but he would try to contrive some way by which
they might look at him. Now, there was, in the garret, a small
fire-fender, which had been laid aside as old and useless. Jonas
recollected this, and thought he could fix up a temporary cage with
it. So he took a small box about as large as a raisin-box, which he
found in the barn, and laid it down on its side, so as to turn the
open side towards the trap, and then moved the trap close up to it.
He then covered up all the rest of the open part of the box with
shingles, and asked James and Rollo to hold them on. Then he
carefully lifted up the cover of the trap, and made a rattling in
the back part of it with the spindle. This drove the squirrel
through out of the trap into the box.
When Jonas was sure that he was in, he took the old fender and
slid it down very cautiously between the trap and the box, so as to
cover the open part entirely, and make a sort of grated front, like
a cage. Then he took the trap away, and there the little
nut-cracker was, safely imprisoned, but yet fairly exposed to
view.
That is, they thought he was safely imprisoned; but he,
little rogue, had no idea of submitting without giving his bolts
and bars a try. At first, he crept along, with his tail curled over
his back, in a corner, and looked at the strange faces which
surrounded him. "Let us give him a little corn," said Rollo;
"perhaps he is hungry;" and he was just slipping some kernels in
between the wires of the fender, when Bunny sprang forward, and,
with a jump and a squeeze, forced his slender body between two of
the wires that were bent a little apart, leaped down upon the barn
floor, ran along to the corner, up the post, and then crept
leisurely along on a beam. Presently, he stopped, and looked down,
as if considering what to do next.
The moment he escaped, the boys exclaimed, "O, catch him, catch
him," and were going to run after him; but Jonas said that it would
do no good, for they could not catch him again now, and had better
stand still and see what he would do.
He soon began to run along on the beam; thence he ascended to
the scaffold, and made his way towards an open window. He jumped up
to the window sill, and then disappeared. The boys all ran around,
outside, and were just in time to catch a glimpse of him, running
along on the top of the fence, down towards the woods again.
"Do let us run after him and catch him," said Rollo.
"Catch him!" said Jonas, with a laugh, "you might as well catch
the wind. No, the only way is to set our trap for him again. I
meant to let him go, myself; but he is not going to slip through
our fingers in that way, I tell him." So Jonas went down that night
and set the trap again.
For several days after this, the trap remained unsprung, and the
boys began to think that they should never see him again. At last,
however, one day, when Rollo was playing in the yard, he saw Jonas
coming up out of the woods with the trap under his arm. Rollo ran
to meet him, and was delighted to find that the squirrel was caught
again.






HOW TO KEEP A SQUIRREL.
Jonas contrived to tighten the wires of the lender, by weaving
in other wires so as to secure the little prisoner this time; and
when he was fairly in his temporary cage, the boys were so pleased
with his graceful form and beautiful colors, especially the elegant
stripes on his back, that they begged hard to keep him; and they
made many earnest promises never to forget to feed him. Jonas said,
at last,
"On the whole. I believe I will let you keep him, but you must
do it in my way."
"What is your way?"
"Why, after a day or two, we must carry him back to his
raspberry-bush, and let him go. But you may give him a name, and
call him yours, and you can carry some corn down there now and
then, to feed him with,&mdash;and then you will see him,
occasionally, playing about there."
James and Rollo did not exactly like this plan at first, but
when they considered how much better the little squirrel himself
would like it, they adopted it; and Rollo proposed that they should
tie a string round his neck for a collar, so that they might know
him again.
"I can get mother to let me have a little pink riband," said he,
"and that will be beautiful."
"It would be a good plan," said Jonas, "to mark him in some way,
but he might gnaw off the riband."
"O no," said James, "he could not gnaw any thing on his own
neck." Rollo thought so too, and they both tried to bite their own
collar ribands, by way of showing Jonas how impossible it was.
"I don't know exactly what the limits are of a squirrel's
gnawing," said Jonas. "Perhaps he might tear it off with his
claws."
"Or he might get another squirrel to gnaw it off for him," said
James.
"Yes," said Jonas, "and there is another difficulty. He might be
jumping from one tree to another, and catch his collar in some
little branch, and so get hung, without judge or jury."
"What can we do then?" said Rollo.
"I think," said Jonas, "that the best plan would be to dye the
end of his tail black. That would not hurt him any; and yet, as he
always holds his tail up, we should see it, and know him."
The boys both thought this would be excellent, and Jonas said he
had some black dye, which he had made for dyeing some wood. Jonas
was a very ingenious boy, and used to make little boxes, and
frames, and windmills, with his penknife, in the long winter
evenings, and he had made this dye out of vinegar and old nails, to
dye some of his wood with.
"I am not certain," said Jonas, "that my dye will color hair; I
never tried it, except on wood. Do you think that black would be a
pretty color?"
"No," said Rollo, "black would not be a very pretty color, but
it would do. Yellow, and red, and green, are pretty colors, but
black, and brown, and white, are not pretty at all."
"I have not got any yellow, or red, or green," said Jonas. "I
don't know but that I have got a little blue."
"O, blue would be beautiful," said James.
Then Jonas walked along into the barn, and Rollo and James
followed him. He went up stairs, and walked along to the farthest
corner, and there, up on a beam, were several small bottles all in
a row. Jonas took down one, and shook it, and said that was the
blue.
He brought it down to the cage; Rollo went into the house, and
brought out an old bowl, and Jonas prepared to pour out the dye
into it. They then concluded that they would carry the whole
apparatus down into the edge of the woods, and perform the
operation there; and then the squirrel, when he was liberated,
would easily find his way back to his home. Jonas carried down a
pair of thick, old gloves, to keep the squirrel from biting
him.
As they walked along, Rollo proposed that Jonas should dip the
squirrel's ears in as well as his tail; "because," said he, "we may
sometimes see him when he is half hid in the bushes, so that only
his head is in sight."
"Besides," said James, "it will make him look more beautiful if
his ears and tail are both blue."
Jonas did not object to this, and after a short time, they
reached the edge of the woods. They found a little opening, where
the ground was smooth and the grass green, which seemed exactly the
place for them. So they put down the cage and the bowl of dye, and
Jonas began to put on his glove.
"Now, boys," said he, "you must be still as moonlight while I do
it. If you speak to me, you will put me out; and besides, you will
frighten little Bunny."
The boys promised not to speak a single word; and Jonas, after
unfastening the fender from the front of the box, moved it along
until there was an opening large enough for him to get his hand in.
Rollo and James stood by silently, and somewhat anxiously, waiting
the result.
When the squirrel saw Jonas's hand intruding itself into the
box, he retreated to the farther corner, and curled himself up
there, with his tail close down upon his back. Jonas followed him
with his hand, saying, in a soothing tone, "Bunny, Bunny, poor
little Bunny."
He reached him, at length, and put his hand very gently over
him, and slowly and cautiously drew him out.
Rollo and James gave a sort of hysteric laugh, and instantly
clapped their hands to their mouths, to suppress it; but they
looked at one another and at Jonas with great delight.
Jonas gradually brought the squirrel over the bowl, and prepared
to dip his ears into the dye. It was a strange situation for a
squirrel to be in, and he did not like it at all; and just at the
instant when his ears were going into the dye, he twisted his head
round, and planted his little fore teeth directly upon Jonas's
thumb. As might have been supposed, teeth which were sharp and
powerful enough to go through a walnut shell, would not he likely
to be stopped by a leathern glove; and Jonas, startled by the
sudden cut, gave a twitch with his hand, and, at the same instant,
let go of the squirrel. Bunny grasped the edge of the howl with his
paws, and leaped out, bringing the bowl itself at the same instant
over upon him, spattering him all over from head to tail with the
blue dye.

 img src="images/illus3.png" alt=
"The boys looked aghast.">
The boys looked aghast for a minute, but when they saw him
racing off as fast as possible, and running up a neighboring tree,
Jonas burst into a laugh, which the other boys joined, and they
continued it loud and long, till the woods rang again.
"Well, we have spotted him, at any rate," said Jonas. "We will
call him Leopard."
The boys then looked at Jonas's bite, and found that it was not
a very serious one. In fact, Jonas was a little ashamed at having
let go for so small a wound However, it was then too late to regret
it and the boys returned slowly home.
As they were walking home, James said that the squirrel's back
looked wet, where the dye went upon him, but he did not
think it looked very blue.
"No," said Jonas, "it does not generally look blue at first, but
it grows blue afterwards. It will be a bright color enough before
you see him again, I will warrant."
So they walked along home; the fender was put back in its place
in the garret, the bowl in the house, and the box in the barn.
Jonas soon forgot that he had been bitten, and the squirrel, as
soon as his back was dry, thought no more of the whole affair, but
turned his attention entirely to the business of digging a hole to
store his nuts in for the ensuing winter.






FIRES IN THE WOODS.
All the large trees that Jonas had felled beyond the brook, he
cut up into lengths, and hauled them up into the yard, and made a
great high wood-pile of them, higher than his head; but all the
branches, and the small bushes, with all the green leaves upon
them, lay about the ground in confusion. Rollo asked him what he
was going to do with them. He said, after they were dry, he should
burn them up, and that they would make a splendid bonfire.
They lay there drying a good many weeks. The leaves turned
yellow and brown, and the little twigs and sticks became gradually
dry and brittle. Rollo used to walk down there often, to see how
the drying went on, and sometimes he would bring up a few of the
bushes, and put them on the kitchen fire, to see whether they were
dry enough to burn.
At last, late in the autumn, one cool afternoon, Jonas asked
Rollo to go down with him and help him pile up the bushes in heaps,
for he was going to burn them that evening. Rollo wanted very much
that his cousins James and Lucy should see the fires; and so he
asked his mother to let him go and ask them to come and take tea
there that night, and go out with them in the evening to the
burning. She consented, and Rollo went. Lucy promised to come just
before tea-time, and James came then, with Rollo, to help him pile
the bushes up.
Jonas said that the boys might make one little pile of their own
if they wished; and told them that they must first make a pile of
solid sticks, and dry rotten logs as large as they could lift or
roll, so as to have a good solid fire underneath, and then cover
these up with brush as high as they could pile it, so as to make a
great blaze. He told them also that they must make their pile where
it would not burn any of the trees which he had left standing, for
he had left a great many of the large oaks, and beeches, and pines,
to ornament the ground and make a shade.
Rollo and James decided to make their pile near the brook,
between the bridge which Jonas made of a tree, and the old wigwam
which they had made some time before of boughs. They got together a
great heap of solid wood, as large pieces as they could lift, and
at one end they put in a great deal of birch bark, which they
stripped off, in great sheets, from an old, decayed birch tree,
which had been lying on the ground near, for half a century. When
this was done, they began to pile on the bushes and brush, taking
care to leave the end where the birch bark was, open. After they
had piled it up as high as they could reach. Rollo clambered up to
the top of it, and James reached the long bushes up to him, and he
arranged them regularly, with the tops out. So they worked all the
afternoon, and by the time they had got their pile done, they found
that Jonas had thrown almost all the rest of the bushes into heaps;
and then they went home to tea.
They found Lucy there, and they were all so eager to go to the
bonfires, that they did not eat much supper. Their father told them
that, as they had so little appetite, they had better carry down
some potatoes and apples, and roast them by the fires. They thought
this an excellent plan, and ran into the store-room to get them.
Their mother gave them a basket to put the potatoes and apples
into, and a little salt folded up in a paper. They were then so
impatient to go that their parents said they might set off with
Jonas, and they themselves would come along very soon.
So Jonas and the three children walked on. Rollo carried the
basket, and Jonas a lantern; and Jonas, as he went along, made,
with his penknife, some flat, wooden spoons, to eat their potatoes
with. They came to the bridge, and all got safely over, though Lucy
was a little afraid at first.
They played around there a few minutes, as the twilight was
coming on; and, soon after, they saw Rollo's father and mother
coming down through the trees, on the other side of the brook. They
stopped on that side, as Rollo's mother did not like to come across
the bridge. Pretty soon they called out to Jonas to light the
fires.
Jonas then took a large piece of birch bark, and touched the
corner of it to the lamp in the lantern, and when it was well on
fire, he laid it carefully on the ground. The bark began to blaze
up very bright, sending out volumes of thick smoke and dense flame,
writhing, and curling, and snapping, as it lay on the ground. The
light shone brightly on the grass and sticks around.
"There," said Jonas, "that will burn some time; now you may
light your torches from that."
"Torches?" said Rollo, "we have not got any torches."
"Have not you made any torches? O, well,&mdash;I will make you
some in a minute."
So he took out his knife, and selected three long slender stems
of bushes, and trimmed them up, and cut off the tops. Then he made
a little split in the top end, and slipped in a piece of birch
bark. Then he handed them to the children, one to each, and said,
"There are your torches; now you can light your fires without
burning your fingers."
So they took their torches, and held the ends over the flame of
the piece of birch bark, which, however, had by this time nearly
burned out. Lucy's took fire, but Rollo's and James's did not, at
first; and as they pressed their torches down more and more to make
them light, they only smothered what little flame was left, and put
it out.
"O dear me!" said Rollo.
Lucy had gone a little way towards a pile; but when she saw what
was the matter, she came back and said, "Here;&mdash;light it by
mine." So the boys held their torches over hers until they were all
three in a bright blaze. They then carried them along, waving them
in the air, and lighting pile after pile, until the whole forest
seemed to be in a flame.
The children stood still a few moments, gazing on the fires, and
on the extraordinary effect which the light produced upon the
objects around. It was a singular scene. Flashing and crackling
flames rose high from the heaps which were on fire, and shed a
strong but unsteady light on the trees, the ground, and the banks
of the brook, and penetrated deep into the forest on every side.
Rollo called upon James and Lucy to look at his father and mother,
who were across the brook; they stood there under the trees, almost
invisible before, but now the bright light shone strongly upon
their faces and forms, and cast upon them a clear and brilliant
illumination, which was strongly contrasted with the dark depths of
the forest behind them.
The children were silent, and stood still for a few minutes,
gazing on the scene with feelings of admiration and awe. They
expected to have capered about and laughed, but they found that
they had no disposition to do so. The enjoyment they felt was not
of that kind which leads children to caper and laugh. They stood
still, and looked silently and soberly on the flashing flames, the
lurid light, the bright red reflections on the woods, the banks,
and the water,&mdash;and on the volumes of glowing smoke and sparks
which ascended to the sky.
Before long, however, the light fuel upon the top of the piles
was burned up, and there remained great glowing heaps of embers,
and logs of wood still flaming. These the boys began to poke about
with long poles that Jonas had cut for them, to make them burn
brighter, and to see the sparks go up. Presently they heard their
father calling them.
The boys all stopped to listen.
"We are going home," said he; "we shall take cold if we stand
still here. You may stay, however, with Jonas, only you must not
sit down."
So Rollo's father and mother turned away, and walked along back
towards the house, the light shining more and more faintly upon
them, until they were lost among the trees.
"Why do you suppose we must not sit down?" said Lucy.
"Because," said Jonas, "they are afraid you will take cold. As
long as you run about and play around the fires, you keep
warm."
"O, then we will run about and play fast enough," said James. "I
know what I am going to do."
So he took a large flat piece of hemlock bark, which he found
upon the ground, and began tearing off strips of birch bark from
the old tree, and piling them upon it.
"What are you going to do?" said Lucy.
"O, I am going to play steam-boat on fire," said he; and he took
up the piece of bark with the little pile of combustibles upon it,
and carried it down to the edge of the brook. Then he went back and
got his torch stick, and put a fresh piece of birch bark in the
split end, and lighted it, and then came back to the brook, walking
slowly lest his torch should go out.
Lucy held his torch for him while he gently put his steam-boat
on the water; and then he lighted it with his torch, and pushed it
out. It floated down, all blazing as it was, to the great delight
of the three children, and astonishment of all the little fishes in
the brook, who could not imagine what the blazing wonder could
be.
The children followed it along down the brook, and began to pelt
it with stones, and soon got into a high frolic. But as they were
very careful not to hit one another with the stones, nor to speak
harshly or cross, they enjoyed it very much. When at last the
steam-boat was fairly pelted to pieces, and the blackened fragments
of the birch bark were scattered over the water, and floating away
down the stream, they began to think of roasting their corn and
potatoes, which they did very successfully over the remains of the
fires. When they had nearly finished eating, Rollo suddenly
exclaimed,&mdash;
"O, I will tell you what we will do; we will go and set our
wigwam on fire!"
Rollo pointed to the wigwam. James and Lucy looked, and observed
that it had been dried and browned in the sun, and Rollo thought it
was no longer good for any thing as a wigwam, but would make a
capital bonfire. He proposed that they should all go into it and
sit down, and put a torch near the side so as to set it on fire, as
if accidentally. They would go on talking as if they did not see
it, and when the flames burst out, they would jump up and run out,
crying, Fire! as people do when their houses get on fire.
Lucy said she should not like to do that. She should be afraid,
she said. The sparks would fall down upon her and burn her. So the
boys gave that plan up. Then James proposed that they should make
believe that they were savages, going to set fire to a town. The
wigwam was to be the town. They would take their torches, and all
go and set it on fire in several places.
"But, then, I could not help," said Lucy, "for women do not go
to war."
"O yes, they do, if they are savages," said James. "We play that
we are savages, you see."
So it was all agreed to. They lighted their torches, and marched
along, waving them in the air, until they came to the wigwam, and
then they danced around it, singing and shouting as they set it on
fire in many places on all sides. The flames spread rapidly, and
flashed up high into the air, and soon there was nothing left of
the poor wigwam but a few smoking and blackened sticks lying on the
ground.
The children then crept along over the bridge, and went towards
home. There were still great beds of burning embers remaining, and
in some places the remains of logs and stumps were blazing
brightly. And that night, when Rollo went to bed, he lay looking
out the window which was towards the woods, and saw the light still
shining among the trees, and the smoke slowly rising from the
fires, and floating away through the air.

THE HALO ROUND THE MOON, OR, LUCY'S VISIT.









"A ROUND RAINBOW."
About six miles from the house where Rollo lived, there was a
mountain called Benalgon, which was famous for bears and
blueberries. There were no bears on it, but there were plenty of
blueberries. The reason why it was so famous for bears, when in
fact there were none there, was because the boys and girls that
went there for blueberries every year, used to see black logs and
stumps among the trees and bushes of the mountain, and they would
run away very hastily, and insist upon it, when they got down the
mountain, that they had seen a bear.
Now, Rollo's father and mother, together with his uncle George,
formed a plan for going up this mountain after blueberries, and
they were going to take Rollo and his cousin Lucy with them. Uncle
George and cousin Lucy were to come in a chaise to Rollo's house
immediately after breakfast, and Rollo was to ride with them, and
his father and mother were to go in another chaise.
Rollo got his little basket to pick his blueberries in, all
ready the night before, and he got a string to tie around his neck,
intending to hang his basket upon it, so that he could have both
his hands at liberty, and pick faster. He also thought he would
take all the heavy things out of his pocket, so that he could run
the faster, in case he should see any bears. He put them all on a
window in the shed. The things were a knife, a piece of chalk, two
white pebble stones, and a plummet. When he got them all out, he
asked Jonas, who was splitting wood in the shed, if he would not
take care of them for him, till he came back.
"Why, yes," said Jonas, "I will take care of them if you wish;
but what are you going to leave them for?"
"O, so that I can run faster," said Rollo.
"Run faster? I do not think you will run much, up old Benalgon,
unless he holds his back down lower than when I went up."
Rollo did not mean that he was going to run up the mountain, but
he did not explain what he did mean, for he thought that Jonas
would laugh at him, if he told him he was afraid of the bears. So
he said, "Jonas, don't you wish you were going with us?"
"I should like it well enough, but I must stay at home and mind
my work."
"I wish you could go. I will go and ask my father if he will not
let you."
Rollo ran into the house with great haste and eagerness, leaving
all the doors open, and calling out, "Father, father," as soon as
he had begun to open the parlor door.
"Father, father," said he, running up to him, "I wish you would
let Jonas go with us to-morrow."

Now, Rollo's father had come home but a short time before, and
was just seated quietly in his arm-chair, reading a newspaper, and
Rollo came up to him, pulling down the paper with his hands, and
looking up into his father's face, so as to stop his reading at
once. Heedless boys very often come to ask favors in this way.
His father gently moved him back and said,
"No, my son, it is not convenient for Jonas to go to-morrow.
Besides, I am busy now, and cannot talk with you;&mdash;you must go
away."
Rollo turned away disappointed, and went slowly back through the
kitchen. His mother, who was there, and who heard all that passed,
as the doors were open, said to him, as he walked by her, "What a
foolish way that was to ask him, Rollo! You might have known it
would have done no good."
Rollo did not answer, but he went and sat down on the step of
the door, and was just beginning to think what the foolishness was
in his way of asking his father, when a little bird came hopping
along in the yard. He ran in to ask his mother to give him some
milk to feed the bird with. She smiled, and told him milk was good
for kittens, but not for birds; and she gave him some crumbs of
bread. Rollo threw the crumbs out, but they only frightened the
little thing away.
That night, when Rollo went to bed, his father said, that when
he was all ready, he would come up and see him. When he came into
his chamber, Rollo called out to him,
"O, father, look out the window, and see what a beautiful ring
there is round the moon."
"So there is," said his father; "I am rather sorry to see
that."
"Sorry, father! why? It is beautiful, I think."
"It does look pretty, but it is a sign of rain to-morrow."
"Of rain? O no, father; it is a kind of a rainbow. It is a round
rainbow. I am sure it will be pleasant to-morrow."
"Very well," said his father, "we shall see in the morning."
Then he sat down on Rollo's bed-side some time, talking with him on
various subjects, and then heard him say his prayers. At length he
took the light, and bade Rollo good night.
Rollo's eye caught another view of the moon as his father was
going, and he said,
"O, father, just look at the moon once more; that is a
rainbow; I see the colors. I expect it will grow into a large one,
such as you told me was a sign of fair weather. I will watch
it."
"Yes," said his father, "you can watch it as you go to
sleep."
So Rollo laid his face upon his pillow in such a way that he
could see the moon through the window; and he began to watch the
bright circle around it, but before it grew any bigger, he was fast
asleep.






WHO KNOWS BEST, A LITTLE BOY OR HIS FATHER?
The next morning, Rollo awoke early, and he was very much
pleased to see, as soon as he opened his eyes, that the sun was
shining in at the windows. He was not only pleased to find that the
prospect was so good for a pleasant ride, but his vanity was
gratified at the thought that it had turned out that he knew better
about the weather than his father. He began to dress himself, as
far as he could without help, and was preparing to hasten down to
his father, to tell him that it was going to be a pleasant day.
When he was nearly dressed, he was surprised lo observe that the
bright sunlight on the wall was gradually fading away, and at
length it wholly disappeared. He went to look out the window to see
what was the cause. He found that there was a broad expanse of dark
cloud covering the eastern sky, excepting a narrow strip quite low
down, near the horizon. When the sun first rose, it shone brightly
through this narrow zone of clear sky; but now it had ascended a
little higher, and gone behind the cloud.
"Never mind," said Rollo to himself. "The cloud is not so very
large after all, and the sun will come out again above it when it
gets up a little higher."
Rollo came down to breakfast, and he went out into the yard
every two or three minutes, to look at the sky. The cloud seemed to
extend, so that the sun did not come out of it, as he expected, but
still he thought it was going to be pleasant Children generally
think it is going to be pleasant, whenever they want to go
away.
His father thought it was probably going to rain, and that at
any rate it was very doubtful whether Uncle George would come.
However, he said they should soon see, and, true enough, just as
they were rising from the breakfast table, a chaise drove up to the
door, and out jumped Uncle George and cousin Lucy.
Lucy was a very pleasant little blue-eyed girl, two or three
years older than Rollo. She had a small tin pail in her hand, with
a cover upon it.
"Good morning, Rollo," said she. "Have you got your basket
ready?"
"Yes," said Rollo; "but I am afraid it is going to rain."
While the children were saying this, Uncle George said to
Rollo's father,
"I suppose we shall have to give up our expedition to-day. I am
in hopes we are going to have some rain."
"In hopes," thought Rollo; "that is very strange when we
want to go a blueberrying."
Rollo's father and mother and his uncle looked at the clouds all
around. They concluded that there was every appearance of rain, and
that it would be best to postpone their excursion, and then went
into the house. Rollo was very confident it would not rain, and was
very eager to have them go. He asked Lucy if she did not think it
was going to be pleasant, but Lucy was more modest and reasonable
than he was, and said that she did not know; she could not judge of
the weather so well as her father.
Rollo began by this time to be considerably out of humor. He
said he knew it was not going to rain, and he did not see why they
might not go. He did not believe it would rain a drop all day.
Lucy just then pointed down to a little dark spot on the stone
step of the door, where a drop had just fallen, and asked Rollo
what he called that.
"And that,&mdash;and that,&mdash;and that," said she, pointing
to several other drops.
Rollo at first insisted that that was not rain, but some little
spots on the stone.
Then Lucy reached out her hand and said,
"Hold out your hand so, Rollo, and you will feel the drops
coming down out of the sky."
Rollo held out his hand a moment, but then immediately withdrew
it, saying, impatiently, that he did not care; it was not rain; at
any rate it was only a little sprinkling.
Lucy observed that Rollo was getting very much out of humor, and
she tried to please him by saying,
"Rollo, I would not mind. If it does rain, I will ask my father
to let me stay and play with you to-day, and we can have a fine
time up in your little room."
"No, we cannot," said Rollo; "and besides, they will not let you
stay, I know. I went yesterday to ask my father to let Jonas go
with us to-day, and he would not."
It was certainly very unreasonable for Rollo to imagine that his
father and uncle would be unwilling to have Lucy stay just because
it had not been convenient to let Jonas go with them. But when
children are out of humor, they are always very unreasonable.
"Why would not he let Jonas go?" asked Lucy.
"I do not know. Mother said it was because I did not ask him
right."
"How did you ask him?"
"O, I interrupted him. He was reading."
"O, that is not the way. I never interrupt my father if I
want to ask him any thing."
"Suppose he is busy, and you want to know that very minute; what
do you do?"
"I will show you. Come with me and I will ask him to let me stay
with you to-day."
So Lucy and Rollo walked in. When they came to the parlor door,
they saw that their parents were sitting on the sofa, talking about
other things.
Rollo stopped at the door, but Lucy went in gently. She walked
up to her father's side, and stood there still.
Her father took no notice of her at first, but went on talking
with Rollo's father. Lucy stood very patiently until, after a few
minutes, her father stopped talking, and said,
"Lucy, my dear, do you want to speak to me?"
"Yes, sir," said Lucy, "I wanted to ask you if you were willing
to let me stay here to-day and play with Rollo, if you do not go to
the mountain."
"I do not know," said her father, hesitating, and patting Lucy
on the head&mdash;"that is a new idea; however, I believe I have no
objection."
Lucy ran back joyfully to Rollo, and after a short time, her
father went home. Rollo, however, did not feel in any better humor,
and all Lucy's endeavors to engage him in some amusement, failed.
She proposed building with bricks, or going up into his little
room, and drawing pictures on their slates, or getting his
storybooks out and reading stories, and various other things, but
Rollo would not be pleased.
Rollo ought, now, when he found that he must be disappointed
about his ride, to have immediately banished it from his mind
altogether, and turned his thoughts to other pleasures; but like
all ill-humored people, he would keep thinking and talking,
all the time, about the thing which caused his ill-humor. So he sat
in a large back entry, where he and Lucy were, looking out at the
door, and saying a great many ill-natured things about the weather,
and his father's giving up the ride just for a little sprinkling of
rain that would not last half an hour. He said it was a shame, too,
for it to rain that day, just because he was going to ride.
Just then, his father spoke to him from the window, and called
him in.
He and Lucy went in together into the parlor.
"Rollo," said his father, "did you know you were doing very
wrong?"
Rollo felt a little guilty, but he said rather faintly, "No,
sir, I was not doing any thing."
"You are committing a great many sins, all at once."
Rollo was silent. He knew his father meant sins of the
heart.
"Your heart is in a very wicked state. You are under the
dominion of some of the worst of feelings; you are self-conceited,
ungrateful, undutiful, unjust, selfish, and," he added in a lower
and more solemn tone, "even impious."
Rollo thought that these were heavy charges to bring upon him;
but his father spoke calmly and kindly, and he knew that he could
easily show that what he said was true.
"You are self-conceited&mdash;vainly imagining that you,
a little boy of seven years old, can judge better than your father
and mother, and obstinately persisting in your opinion that it is
not going to rain, when the rain has actually commenced, and is
falling faster and faster. You are ungrateful, to speak
reproachfully of me, and give me pain, by your ill-will, when I
have been planning this excursion, in a great degree, for your
enjoyment, and only give it up because I am absolutely compelled to
do it by a storm; undutiful, in showing such a repining,
unsubmissive spirit towards your father; unjust in making
Lucy and all of us suffer, because you are unwilling to submit to
these circumstances that we cannot control; selfish, in
being unwilling that it should rain and interfere with your ride,
when you know that rain is so much wanted in all the fields, all
over the country; and, what is worse than all, impious, in
openly rebelling against God, and censuring the arrangements of his
providence, and pretending to think that they are made just to
trouble you."
When he had said this, he paused to hear what Rollo would say.
He thought that if he was convinced of his sin, and really
penitent, he would acknowledge that he was wrong, or at least be
silent;&mdash;but that if, on the other hand, he were still
unsubdued, he would go to making excuses.
After a moment's pause, Rollo said,&mdash;"I did not know that
there was need of rain in the fields."
"Did not you?" said his father. "Did not you know that the
ground was very dry, and that, unless we have rain soon, the crops
will suffer very much?"
"No, sir," said Rollo.
"It is so," said his father; "and this rain, which you are so
unwilling to have descend, is going down into the ground all over
the country, and into the roots of all the plants growing in the
fields, carrying in the nourishment which will swell out all the
corn and grain, and apples and pears. In a few days there will be
thousands and thousands of dollars' worth of fruit and food more
than there would have been without this rain; and yet you are very
unwilling to have it come, because you want to go and get a few
blueberries!"
Rollo was confounded, and had not a word to say.
"Now, Rollo," continued his father, "all the rest of us are
disposed to be good-humored, and to acquiesce in God's decision,
and try to have a happy day at home; and we cannot have it spoiled
by your wicked repinings. So you must go away by yourself, until
you feel willing to submit pleasantly and with good humor. Then you
may come back, but be sure not to come back before."






REPENTANCE.
Now there was in Rollo's house a small back garret, over a part
of the kitchen chamber, which had one small window in it, looking
out into the garden. This garret was not used, and Rollo's father
had put a little rocking-chair there, and a small table with a
Bible on it, and hung some old maps about it, so as to make it as
pleasant a little place as he could; and there he used to send
Rollo when he had done any thing very wrong, or when he was sullen
and ill natured, that he might reflect in solitude, and either
return a good boy, or else stay where his bad feelings would not
trouble or injure others. His father had put in marks, too, at
several places in the Bible, where he thought it would be well for
him to read at such times; as he said that reading suitable
passages in the Bible would be more likely to bring him to
repentance, than any other book.
Rollo knew that when his father told him to go away by himself,
he meant for him to go into this back garret. So he turned round
and walked out of the room. As he passed up the back stairs, the
kitten came frisking around him, but he had no heart to play with
her, and walked on. He then turned and went up the narrow, steep
stairs that led to the garret; they were rather more like a ladder
than like stairs. Rollo ascended them, and then sat down in the
little rocking-chair. The rain was beating against the windows, and
pattering on the roof which was just over his head.
 img id="pic6" src="images/illus6.png" alt=
"Rollo sitting in his chair.">
It is sometimes but a little thing which turns the whole current
of the thoughts and feelings. In Rollo's case, at this time, it was
but a drop of water. For after having sat some time in his chair,
his heart remaining pretty nearly the same, a drop of water, which,
somehow or other, contrived to get through some crevice in the
boards and shingles over his head, fell exactly into the back of
his neck. The first feeling it occasioned was an additional emotion
of impatience and fretfulness. But he next began to think how
unreasonable and wicked it was to make all that difficulty, just
because his father was preventing his going out to stay all day in
the rain, when a single drop falling upon him vexed and irritated
him.
He also looked out of the window towards the garden, and the dry
ground, and all the trees and garden vegetables seemed to be
drinking in the rain with delight. That made him think of the vast
amount of good the rain was doing, and he saw his own selfishness
in a striking point of view. In a word Rollo was now beginning to
be really penitent. The tears came into his eyes; but they were
tears of real sorrow for sin, not of vexation and anger.
He took up his little Bible, to read one of the passages, as his
father had advised him. He happened to open at a mark which his
father had put in at the parable of the prodigal son. The first
verse which his eye fell upon, was the verse, "I will arise and go
to my father." Rollo thought that that was exactly the thing for
him to do&mdash;to go and confess his fault to his father.
So he laid down his little Bible, wiped the tears from his eyes,
and went down stairs. He met his father in the entry. He went up to
him, and took his hand, and said,
"Father, I am really very sorry I have been so naughty; I
will try to be a good boy now."
His father stooped down and kissed him. "I am very glad to hear
it, Rollo," said he. "Now you may go and find Lucy. I believe she
is up in your mother's chamber."
Rollo went off quite happy in pursuit of Lucy. He found her
sitting on a cricket in his mother's room, looking over a little
picture-book. Rollo ran laughing up to her, and said,
"What have you got, Lucy?"
"One of your little picture-books. Will you lend it to me to
carry home?"
Rollo said he would, and then they began to talk about what they
should do. It rained very fast, and they could not go out of doors;
and, after proposing several things, which, however, neither of
them seemed to like, they turned to Rollo's mother, and asked her
what they had better do.
"I always find," said his mother, "that when I am disappointed
of any pleasure, it is best not to try to find any other pleasure
in its place, but to turn to duty."
The children did not understand this very well, and they were
silent.
"What I mean," she continued, "is this: When we have just been
disappointed of any pleasure which we had set our hearts upon, it
is very difficult to find any thing else that we can have in its
place, that will look as pleasant as the one we had lost. You see
that you are not satisfied with any thing you propose to one
another. Now, I find that the best way, in such cases, is to give
up pleasure altogether, and turn to some duty; and after performing
the duty a short time, peace and satisfaction return to the mind
again, and we get over the effects of the disappointment in the
quickest and pleasantest way."
Rollo and Lucy looked at one another rather soberly. They did
not seem to know what to say.
"I presume, however, you will not do this," continued his
mother.
"Why?" said Rollo.
"Because," said his mother, "it requires a good deal of
resolution, at first, to turn to duty when you have just
been setting your heart on pleasure."
"O, we have got resolution enough," said Rollo.
"What duty do you think we had better do?" asked Lucy.
"If I were you," replied Rollo's mother, "I should first of all
sit down and have a good reading lesson."
Rollo and Lucy hesitated a little, but they concluded to take
their mother's advice at last, and went to Rollo's little library,
and chose a book, and then went down to the back entry, and sat
down there, on a long cricket, and began to read.
At first, it was rather hard to do it, for it did not look very
pleasant to either of them to sit down and read, just at the time
when they expected to be gathering blueberries on the mountain.
Rollo said, when they were opening the hook and finding the place,
that, if they had gone, they should, by that time, have just about
arrived at the foot of the mountain.
"Yes," said Lucy, "but we must not think of that now. Besides,
just see how it rains. It would be a fine time now to go up a
mountain, wouldn't it?"
Rollo looked out of the open door, and saw the rain pouring down
into the yard, and felt again ashamed to recollect how he had
insisted that it was not going to rain.
Lucy said it was beautiful to see it pouring down so fast.
"Look," said she; "how it streams down from the spout at the corner
of the barn!"
"Yes," said Rollo, "and see that little pond out by the garden
gate. How it is all full of little bubbles! It will be a beautiful
pond for me to sail boats in, when the rain is over. I can make
paper-boats and pea boats!"
"Pea boats?" said Lucy; "what are pea-boats?"
"O! they are beautiful little boats," said he. "Jonas showed me
how to make them. We take a pea-pod, a good large full pea-pod, and
shave off the top from one end to the other, and then take out the
peas, and it makes a beautiful little boat. I wish we had some; I
could show you."
"Let us make some when we have done reading, and sail them. Only
that pond will all go away when the rain is over."
"O no," said Rollo, "I will put some ground all around it, and
then the water cannot run away."
"Yes, but it will soak down into the ground."
"Will it?" said Rollo. "Well, we can sail our boats on it a
little while before it is gone."
"But it is so wet," said Lucy, "we cannot go out to get any
pea-pods."
"I did not think of that," said Rollo. "Perhaps Jonas could get
some for us, with an umbrella."
"I could go with an umbrella," said Lucy, "just as well
as not."
The children saw an umbrella behind the door, and they thought
they would go both together, and they actually laid down their
book, spread the umbrella, and went to the door. It then occurred
to them that it would not be quite right to go out, without leave;
so Rollo went to ask his mother.
His mother said it was not suitable for young ladies to go out
in the rain, as their shoes, and their dress generally, were thin,
and could not bear to be exposed to wet; but she said that Rollo
himself might take off his shoes and stockings, and go out alone,
when the rain held up.
"But, mother," said he, "why cannot I go out now, with the
umbrella?"
"Because," she replied, "when it rains fast, some of the water
spatters through the umbrella, and some will be driven against you
by the wind."
"Well, I will wait, and as soon as it rains but little, I will
go out. But must I take off my shoes and stockings?"
"Yes," said his mother, "or else you will get them wet and
muddy. And before you go you must get a dipper of water ready in
the shed, to pour on your feet, and wash them, when you get back;
and then wait till they are entirely dry, before you put on your
shoes and stockings again. If you want the pea-pods enough to take
all that trouble, you may go for them."
Rollo said he did want them enough for that, and he then went
back and told Lucy what his mother had said, and they concluded to
read until the rain should cease, and that then Rollo should go out
into the garden.
They began to read; but their minds were so much upon the
pea-pod boats, that the story did not interest them very much.
Besides, children cannot read very well aloud, to one another; for
if they succeed in calling all the words right, they do not
generally give the stops and the emphasis, and the proper tones of
voice, so as to make the story interesting to those that hear. Some
boys and girls are vain enough to think that they can read very
well, just because they can call all the words without stopping to
spell them; but this is very far from being enough to make a good
reader.
Rollo read a little way, and then Lucy read a little way; but
they were not much interested, and thinking that the difficulty
might be in the book, they got another, but with no better success.
At last Rollo said they would go and get their mother to read to
them. So they went together to her room, and Rollo said that they
could not get along very well in rending themselves, and asked her
if she would not be good enough to read to them.
"Why, what is the difficulty?" said she.
"O, I do not know, exactly: the story is not very interesting,
and then we cannot read very well."
"In what respect will it be better for me to read to you?" she
asked.
"Why, mother, you can choose us a prettier story; and then we
should understand it better if you read it."
"I suppose you would; but I see you have made a great
mistake."
"What mistake?" said both the children at once.
"Why is it that you are going to read at all?"
"Why, you advised us to, mother."
"Did I advise you to do it as a duty, or as a
pleasure?"
"As a duty, mother; I recollect now." said Rollo.
"Yes: well, now the mistake you have made is, that you are
looking upon it only as a pleasure, and instead of doing it
faithfully, in such a way as will make it most useful to you, you
are forgetting that altogether, and only intent upon having it
interesting and pleasant. Is it not so?"
"Why&mdash;yes," said Rollo, hesitating, and looking down; and
then turning round to Lucy, he said, "I suppose we had better go
and read the story ourselves."
"Do just as you please," said his mother. "I have not commanded
you to read, but only recommended it; and that not as a way of
interesting you, but as a way of spending an hour
usefully, as a preparation for an hour of enjoyment
afterwards. You can do as you please, however; but if you attempt
to read at all, I advise you to do it not as play, but as a
lesson."
"Well, come, Rollo," said Lucy, "let us go."
So the children ran back to the entry, and sat down to their
story, taking pains to read carefully, as if their object was to
learn to read; and though they did not expect it, they did, in
fact, have a very pleasant time.
The rest of the adventures of Rollo and Lucy, during this day
must be reserved for another story.

THE FRESHET



The story that Rollo and his cousin Lucy began to read together,
in the back entry, looking out towards the garden, that rainy day
when they were disappointed of the excursion up the mountain,
commenced as follows:&mdash;






MARIA AND THE CARAVAN.
Maria Wilton lives in the pretty white house which stands just
at the entrance of the wood, where the children find the
blackberries so thick in the berrying season. It is not as large or
elegant a house as many that we pass on a walk through the village;
but yet, with its neatly-painted front and blooming little garden,
its appearance is quite as inviting as that of many a more splendid
mansion. Certain it is, at least, that there is not a more pleasant
or happy dwelling in the town. Neatness and good order regulate all
the arrangements of the family, and where such is the case, it is
almost needless to add that peace and harmony characterize the
intercourse of the inmates. It is seldom that confusion or uproar,
or disputes or contentions, are known among the Wiltons.
But it was of Maria that I was intending to speak more
particularly,&mdash;her kind, and yielding, and conciliating
manners towards her brothers and sisters. Maria was not the oldest
of the children; she was not quite nine, and her sister Harriet was
as much as eleven, and her brother George still older. And yet her
influence did more to maintain peace and good feeling in the family
group, than would have been believed by a person who had not
observed her. In every case where only her own wishes or
inclinations were concerned, Maria was ready to give up to George
or Harriet; because, as she said, they were older than herself; and
again, she was quite as ready to yield to little Susan and Willy,
because they were younger. Her brothers and sisters, in their turn,
were far less apt to contend for any privilege or advantage, than
they would have been, if she had shown herself more tenacious of
her own rights.
Mr. Wilton used occasionally to go into the city, a few miles
distant, upon business. He usually went in a chaise, taking one of
the children with him. The excursion was to them a very pleasant
one, and all anticipated, with a great deal of pleasure, their
respective turns to ride with their father. It happened that the
day when it fell to Maria's turn, was to be the close of an
exhibition of animals, which had been for a short time in the city.
Maria's eye brightened with pleasure as her father mentioned this
circumstance at the dinner table, and inquired if she would like to
visit the caravan.
"O, father!" exclaimed George, eagerly, as he laid down his
knife and fork; "a caravan!&mdash;Mayn't I go?"
"You cannot both go," replied his father; "and I believe it is
Maria's turn to go into town with me."
"Well," said George, "but I don't believe Maria would care any
thing about seeing it;" and his eye glanced eagerly from his father
to Maria, and then from Maria to his father again.
"How is it, Maria?" said Mr. Wilton; "have you no wish to visit
the caravan?"
Maria did not answer directly, while yet her countenance showed
very plainly what her wishes really were. "Is there an
elephant there, father?" she, at length, rather hesitatingly
inquired.
"There probably is," replied her father.
"An elephant!" repeated George with something of a sneer;
"who has not seen an elephant? I would not give a farthing to go,
if there was nothing better than an elephant to be seen."
"What should you care so much to see?" inquired Mr.
Wilton.
"Why, I would give any thing to see a leopard or a camel."
"A leopard or a camel!" repeated his father in the same tone in
which George had made his rude speech; "I am sure I wouldn't give a
farthing to see either a camel or a leopard."
"No," said George, "because you have seen them both; but
I never did."
"Neither has Maria seen an elephant," returned Mr. Wilton; "so
what is the difference?"
George looked a little mortified at the overthrow of his
argument. But still his eagerness for the gratification was not to
be repressed.&mdash;"I shouldn't think a girl need to care
about going to see a parcel of wild beasts," he remarked, rather
petulantly, as he gave his chair a push, upon rising from the
table.
"O, George, George." expostulated his father, "I did not think
you were either a selfish or a sullen boy."
"No, father, and he is not," said Maria, approaching her father,
and taking his hand; "but he wants to go very much, and I do not
care so much about it; so he may go, and I will stay at
home."
"You are a good girl," said her father; "but I shall not consent
to any such injustice; so go and get ready as quick as
possible."
"But, father, I had really a great deal rather that George
should go," insisted Maria.
"But I cannot think that George would really, on the whole,
prefer to take your place," said Mr. Wilton, turning to George.
"No, sir." replied George, who&mdash;restored by this time to a
sense of propriety and justice&mdash;was standing ready to speak
for himself. "No, sir; Maria is very kind; but I do not wish to
take her place; I am very sorry indeed that I said any thing about
it. I certainly shall not consent to hike your place, Maria," he
said, perceiving that she was ready to entreat still further.
"O! but I do wish you would," said Maria. But just here her
mother interposed. "If Maria would really prefer to give up her
place to her brother," said Mrs. Wilton, "I certainly shall like
the arrangement very much, for I am to be particularly engaged this
afternoon, and, as Harriet is to be absent, I shall be very glad of
some of Maria's assistance in taking care of the baby."
"O! well," said Maria, brightening up, "then I am sure I will
not go: so run, George, for father is almost ready to start."
Thus the matter was amicably settled. George went with his
father, and Maria remained at home to help take care of little
Willy.
Maria loved her little brother very much, and she never seemed
tired of taking care of him, even when he was ever so fretful or
restless. She would leave her play, at any moment, to run and rock
the baby, or to hold him in her lap; for, even if she felt
inclined, at any time, to be a little out of patience for a moment,
she would recollect how many hours she had herself been nursed, by
night and by day, and she was glad of an opportunity to relieve her
mother of some of her care and fatigue. Her cousin, Ellen Weston,
called, one afternoon, to ask her to accompany a party of little
girls, who were going to gather berries in the wood near Maria's
house. It happened that Maria had been left with the care of Willy,
just as her cousin called; and it happened, too, that Willy was
that afternoon unusually fretful and difficult to please. If Maria
left him for a moment, or if she did not hold him exactly in the
posture which suited him, or if she had not precisely the thing
ready which he wanted at the moment, he would act just as all
babies of nine or ten months sometimes take it into their heads to
act. With all her patience and good-humor, she hardly knew how to
manage him; and especially after having been obliged to reject so
agreeable an invitation as the one her cousin brought, she found
her task a little irksome.
She could hardly repress an occasional expression of impatience,
as she tried in vain to please the wayward little fellow. But her
patience and good-humor were very soon restored; and as she
reflected that she was doing her mother a great deal of good, by
staying at home with Willy, she felt quite willing to dismiss all
thoughts of the berrying expedition. The girls, however, did not
forget her. It was proposed by one of the party, when Ellen had
stated the reason why Maria could not join them, that each should
contribute some portion of her berries to be carried to her on
their way home. All agreed very readily to the plan, and each took
pains to select the largest and the ripest of her berries for
Maria's basket. The gratification afforded Maria by this little
token of kind remembrance, more than compensated for the
self-denial which she had practised. It is almost always the case
when persons cheerfully submit to any privation, for the sake of
other persons, or because it is duty, that they are amply rewarded
for it. They enjoy, at least, the consciousness of doing right,
which is one of the very highest sources of pleasure. Maria would,
at any time, have been satisfied with only this reward; but it very
often happened, very unexpectedly, that something more was in store
for her. This was the case upon the time when she gave up her ride,
and her visit to the caravan, for the sake of her brother. I have
not said that it was absolutely Maria's duty to yield to her
brother, in this case: perhaps it would have been perfectly right
for her to have maintained her own claims; and yet there is no
doubt that she felt a great deal happier for the sacrifice she had
made.
But we were going to speak of some further reward that her
amiable behavior, in this instance, procured her. As her father
opened a package which he had brought on his return, he silently
placed in her hands a beautiful copy of a newly-published work,
upon the fly-leaf of which she found written&mdash;"Maria
Wilton&mdash;a reward for her kind and obliging manners towards her
brothers and sisters."






SMALL CRAFT.
When they had finished the story, Lucy shut the book, saying,
"Maria was a good girl, was not she, Rollo?"
"Yes," said Rollo, "she was an excellent girl. I would have done
just so; would not you, Lucy?"
"I ought to, I know," said Lucy, "but perhaps I should not."
"I should, I am sure," said Rollo.
Lucy was a polite girl, and she did not contradict Rollo, though
she recollected how much selfishness he had shown that morning, and
it did not seem to her very likely that he would have been willing
to make any very great sacrifice to oblige others.
"My father says we cannot tell what we should do until we are
tried," said Lucy.
"Well, I know I should have been willing to stay at home,
if I had been Maria," replied Rollo.
"But, only think, that would be preferring another person's
pleasure rather than your own."
"Well, I should prefer another person's pleasure rather
than my own."
Rollo was beginning to get a little excited and vexed. People
who boast of excellences which they do not possess, are very apt to
be unreasonable and angry when any body seems to doubt whether
their boastings are true. He was thus going on, insisting upon it
that he should have acted as Maria had done, and was just saying
that he should prefer another person's pleasure rather than his
own, when Jonas came into the entry from the kitchen, with an
armful of wood, which he was carrying into the parlor.
"When is it, Rollo," said Jonas, "that you prefer another
person's pleasure to your own?"
"Always," said Rollo, with an air of self-conceit and
consequence.
Jonas smiled, and went on with his wood.
It is always better for boys to be modest and humble-minded.
They appear ridiculous to others when they are boasting what
great things they can do; and when they boast what
good things they do they are very likely to be just on the
eve of doing exactly the opposite.
In a moment Jonas came back out of the parlor, and said, as he
passed through,
"Self-praise

Goes but
little ways;"
a short piece of versification which all boys and girls would do
well to remember.
Now it happened that, all this time, Rollo's mother was sitting
in a little bedroom, which had a door opening into the entry where
Lucy and Rollo had been reading, and she heard all the
conversation. She knew that though Rollo was generally a good boy,
and was willing to know his faults, and often endeavored to correct
them, still that he was, like all other boys, prone to selfishness
and to vanity, and she thought that she must take some way to show
him clearly what the truth really was, about his
disinterestedness.
In a few minutes, therefore, she went out of the room, and took
from the store closet an apple and a pear. They were both good, but
the pear was particularly fine. It was large, mellow, and juicy.
She then went back to her seat, and called, "Rollo."
Rollo came running to her.
"Here," said she, "is an apple and a pear for you."
"Is one for me and one for Lucy?" said he.
"That is just as you please. I give them both to you. You may do
what you choose with them."
Rollo took the fruit, much pleased, and walked slowly back,
hesitating what to do. He thought he must certainly give one to
Lucy, and as he had just been boasting that he preferred another's
pleasure to his own, he was ashamed to offer her the apple; and yet
he wanted the pear very much himself.
If he had had a little more time, he would have hit upon a plan
which would have removed all the difficulty at once, by dividing
both the apple and the pear, and giving to Lucy half of each. But
he did not think of this. In fact his mother knew that, as he was
going directly bark to Lucy, he would not have much time to think
but must act according to the spontaneous impulse of his heart.
But though he did not think of dividing the apple and the pear,
he happened to hit upon a plan, which occurred to him just as he
was going back into the entry, that he thought would do.
He held the fruit behind him; the apple in one hand, and the
pear in the other. Lucy saw him coming, and said,
"What have you got, Rollo?"
"Which will you have, right hand or left?" said he in reply.
"Right."
Rollo held forward his right hand, and, lo! it was the pear. But
he could not bear to part with it, and he brought forward the
other, and said,
"No, you may have the apple."
"No," said Lucy; "the pear is fairly mine; you asked me which I
would have, and I said the right."
"But I want the pear," said Rollo; "you may have the apple.
Mother gave them both to me."
"I want the pear too," said Lucy; "it is mine, and you must give
it to me."
Just then a voice called from the bedroom,
"Children!"
"What, mother?" said Rollo.
"I want you both to come here."
Rollo and Lucy would both have been ashamed of their contention,
were it not that the pear looked so very rich and tempting, that
they were both very eager to have it.
"What is the difficulty?" said Rollo's mother, as soon as they
stood before her.
"Why, Lucy wants the pear," said Rollo, "and you gave them both
to me, and said I might do as I pleased with them. I am willing to
give her the apple."
"Yes, but he offered me my choice," said Lucy, "right hand or
left, and I chose the right, and now he ought to give it to
me."
"And are you willing that I should decide it?" said the
lady.
"Yes, mother," and "Yes, aunt," said Rollo and Lucy
together.
"You have both done wrong; not very wrong, but a little
wrong; and I think neither ought to have the whole of the pear. So
I shall divide the pear and the apple both between you; and I will
tell you how you have done wrong.
"You, Rollo, by asking her which she would have, implied that
you would leave it to chance to decide, and that you would let her
have her fair chance. Then you ought to have submitted to the
result. If she had chosen the left hand, she ought to have been
content. If she had got the apple, you would have had the credit of
giving her an equal chance with you, and she ought therefore to
have had the full benefit of the chance.
"And then you, Lucy, did wrong, for, although Rollo asked you to
choose, he did not actually promise you your choice, and as
he was under no obligation to give you either, you ought not to
have insisted upon his fulfilling his implied promise. Is it
not so?"
The children both saw and admitted that it was.
"The best way, I think," she continued, "would have been for
you, Rollo, to have given the pear to Lucy, as she was your
visitor, and a young lady too. Then she would have given you half
in eating it. However, you were not very much in the wrong, either
of you. It was a sort of a doubtful case. But I hope you see from
it, Rollo, what I wanted to teach you, that you are no more
inclined to prefer other persons' pleasure to your own, than other
children are. Remember Jonas's couplet hereafter. I think it is a
very good one. Now go and get a knife, and cut the fruit; and see,
it does not rain but little; you can go and get your pea-pods
now."
Away went the children out into the kitchen after a knife. Rollo
wanted to cut the apple and the pear himself, and Lucy made no
objection; and we must do him the justice to say that he gave
rather the largest half of each to Lucy. They then went out into
the shed, Rollo taking with him a dipper of water to wash his feet
when he came back from the garden. Rollo then took off his shoes,
and gave Lucy his share of the fruit, to keep for him, and then
sallied forth into the yard, holding the umbrella over his head, as
a few drops of rain were still falling.
He waded into the little pond at the garden gate, and then
turned round to look at Lucy and laugh. He began, too, to caper
about in the water, but Lucy told him to take care, or he would
fall down, and they could not wash his clothes, as they
could his feet, with their dipper of water.
So he went carefully forward till he came to the peas, and
gathered as many as he wanted, and then returned.
As he was coming back, he saw Jonas in the barn. Jonas called
out to him to ask what he had got.
"I have been to get some pea-pods," said he, "to make boats
with."
"Where are you going to sail them?" said Jonas.
"O, in this little pond, when it is done raining."
"But you had better have a little pond now, in the
shed."
"How can we?" said Rollo.
"You might have it in a milk-pan."
"So we can. Could you come and get it for us?"
"Yes, in a few minutes&mdash;by the time you get your boats
made."
Rollo and Lucy were much pleased with this, and they sat down,
one on each side of the milk-pan pond, and sailed their boats a
long time. He cut small pieces of the apple and of the pear for
cargo, and Rollo put in the stem of the pear for the captain of his
boat. Each one was good-humored and obliging, and the time passed
away very pleasantly, until it was near dinner-time. When they came
in to dinner, they observed that it was raining again very
fast.






THE PRINCIPLES OF ORDER.
"Father," said Rollo, at the dinner-table, "do you think it will
rain all the afternoon?"
"It looks like it," replied his father, "but why? Do you not
enjoy yourselves in the house?"
"O yes, sir," said Rollo, "we have had a fine time this morning;
but Lucy and I thought that, if it did not rain this afternoon, we
might go out in the garden a little."
"It may clear up towards night; but, if it does, I think it
would be better to go down to the brook and see the freshet, than
to go into the garden."
"The freshet? Will there be a freshet, do you think?"
"Yes, if it rains this afternoon as fast as it does now, I think
the brook will be quite, high towards night."
Rollo was much pleased to hear this. He told Lucy, after dinner,
that the brook looked magnificently in a freshet; that the banks
were brimming full, and the water poured along in a great torrent,
foaming and dashing against the logs and rocks.
"Then, besides, Lucy," said he, "we can carry down our little
boats and set them a sailing. How they will whirl and plunge along
down the stream!"
Lucy liked the idea of seeing the freshet, too, very much;
though she said she was afraid it would be too wet for her to go.
Rollo told her never to fear, for his father would contrive some
way to get her down there safely, and they both went to the back
entry door again, looking out, and wishing now that it would rain
faster and faster, as they did before dinner that it would cease to
rain.
"But," said Lucy, "what if it should not stop raining at all,
to-night?"
"O, it will," said Rollo, "I know it will. Besides, if it should
not, we can go down to-morrow morning, you know, and then there
will be a bigger freshet. O how full the brook will be by to-morrow
morning!"
And Rollo clapped his hands, and capered with delight.
"Yes," said Lucy, soberly, "but I must go home to-night."
"Must you?" said Rollo. "So you must. I did not think of
that."
"But I think," continued he, "that it will certainly clear up
to-night. I will go and ask father if he does not think so
too."
They both went together back into the parlor to ask the
question.
"I cannot tell, my children, whether it will or not. I see no
indications, one way or the other. I think you had better forget
all about it, and go to doing something else; for if you spend all
the afternoon in watching the sky, and trying to guess whether it
will clear up or not, you cannot enjoy yourselves, and may be sadly
disappointed at last."
"Why, we cannot help thinking of it, father."
"You cannot, if you stand there at the back door, doing nothing
else; but, if you engage in some other employment, you will soon
forget all about it."
"What do you think we had better do?" said Lucy.
"I think you had better go up and put your room and your desk
all in order, Rollo; Lucy can help you."
"But, father, I have put it in order a great many times, and it
always gets out of order again very soon, and I cannot keep it
neat."
"That is partly because you do not put it in order right. You do
not understand the principles of order."
"What are the principles of order?" said Lucy.
"There are a good many. I will tell you some of them, and then
you may go and apply them in arranging Rollo's things.
"One principle is to have the things that are most frequently
used in the most accessible place, so that they can be taken out
and returned to their proper places easily.
"Another good principle for you is to distinguish between the
things which you wish to use, and those you only wish to
preserve. The former ought to be in sight, and near at hand.
The latter may be packed away more out of view.
"Another principle is to avoid having your desk and room
encumbered with things of little or no value, as stones you have
picked up, and papers, and sticks. The place to keep such things is
in the barn or shed, not in your private room.
"Then you must arrange your things systematically, putting
things of the same nature together. Once I looked into your desk
after you had put it in order, and I found that, in the back side
of it, you had piled up hooks, and white paper, and pictures, and a
slate, and a pocket-book or two, all together. You thought they
were in order, because they were in a pile. Now, they ought
to have been separated and arranged; all the white paper by itself
in front, where you can easily get it to use; the pictures all by
themselves in a portfolio; and the books should be arranged, not in
a pile, but in a row, on their edges, so that you can
get out any one without disturbing the others. Those are some of
the principles of order."
"Well, come, Rollo," said Lucy, "let us go and see your things,
and try to put them in order, right."
Rollo went, but, as he left the room, he turned round to ask his
father if he would not come with them, and just show them a little
about it. His father said he could not come very well then, but if
they would try and do as well as they could, he would come and look
over their work after it was done, and tell them whether it was
right or not.
Rollo and Lucy went up into Rollo's room, and, true enough, they
found not a little confusion there. But they went to work, and soon
became very much interested in their employment. A great many of
the things were new to Lucy, and as they went on arranging them,
they often stopped to talk and play. In this way several hours
passed along very pleasantly; and when, at last, they had got them
nearly arranged, Rollo went to the window to throw out some old
stones that he concluded not to keep any longer, when he exclaimed
aloud,
"O, Lucy, Lucy, come here quick."
Lucy ran. Rollo pointed out to the western horizon, and said,
"See there!"
There was a broad band of bright golden sky all along the
western horizon&mdash;clear and beautiful, and extending each way
as far as they could see. The dark clouds overhead reached down to
the edge of this clear sky, where they hung in a fringe of gold,
and the dazzling rays of the sun were just peeping under it. The
rain had ceased.
 img id="pic8" src="images/illus8.png" alt=
"The rain had ceased.">
Rollo and Lucy gazed at it a moment, and then ran down stairs as
fast as they could go, calling out,
"It is clearing away! It is clearing away! Father, it is
clearing away. We can go and see the freshet."






CLEARING UP.
They went out upon the steps to look at the sky. A few drops of
rain were still falling, but the clouds appeared to be breaking in
several places, and the tract of golden sky in the west was rising
and extending. The air was calm, and the golden rays of the sun
shone upon the fields and trees, and upon the glittering drops that
hung from the leaves and branches. Rollo and Lucy both said it was
beautiful.
They went in and urged their father to go with them down to the
brook to see the freshet, but he said they must wait till after
tea. "It is too wet to go now," said he.
"But, father," said Rollo, "I do not think it will be any better
after tea. The ground cannot dry in half an hour."
"No," said his father; "but the water will run off of the paths
a great deal, so that we can get along much better."
"Well, but then it will run off from the brook a great deal too,
and the freshet will not be so high."
"It is a little different with the brook," his father replied,
"for that is very long, and the water comes a great way, from among
the hills. Now, while we are taking tea, the water will be running
into the brook back among the hills, faster than it will run away
here, so that it will grow higher and higher for some hours."
Rollo had no more to say, but he was impatient to go. He and
Lucy went out and stood on the steps again. The clouds were
breaking up and flying away in all directions, and large patches of
clear blue sky appeared everywhere, giving promise of a beautiful
evening.
"Hark!" said Rollo; "what is that?"
Lucy listened. It was a sort of roaring sound down in the woods.
Rollo at first thought it was a bear growling.
"Do you think it is a bear?" said he to Lucy, with a look of
some concern.
"A bear!&mdash;no," said Lucy, laughing. "That is not the way a
bear growls. It is the freshet."
"The freshet!" said Rollo.
"Yes; it is the water roaring along the brook."
Rollo listened, and he immediately perceived that it was the
sound of water, and he jumped and capered with delight, at thinking
how fine a sight it must be.
At the tea-table Rollo's father explained the plan he had formed
for their going. He said it was rather a difficult thing to go and
see a freshet without getting wet&mdash;especially for a girl. He
and Rollo, he said, could put on their good thick boots, but Lucy
had none suitable for such a walk, as it would probably be very wet
and muddy in some places.
"What shall we do then?" said Rollo.
"I believe I shall let Jonas go down and draw Lucy in his
wagon," said his father. "How should you like that, Lucy?"
Lucy said she should like it very well, and after tea they went
out to the garden-yard door, where they found Jonas with his wagon
all ready. This wagon was one which Jonas had made to draw Rollo
upon. It was plain and simple, but strong and convenient, and
perfectly safe. They helped Lucy into it, and she sat down on the
little seat. Rollo, with his hoots on, took hold behind to push,
and Jonas drew. Rollo's father walked behind, and thus they set off
to view the freshet.

They moved along carefully through the yard, and then turned by
the gate and went into the field. The path led them by the garden
fence for some distance, and they went along very pleasantly for a
time, until at length they came to a large pool of water covering
the whole path. There were high banks on each side, so that the
wagon could not turn out.
"What shall we do now?" said Rollo.
"I can go right through it," said Jonas; "it is not deep."
"And we can go along on the bank, by the side," said Rollo.
"Very well." said his father, "if you are not afraid, Lucy."
Lucy did feel a little afraid at first, but she knew that if her
uncle was willing that she should go, there could not be any
danger; so she made no objection. Besides, she knew that, as Jonas
was to walk along before her, she could see how deep it was, and
there could not be any deep places without his finding it out
before the wagon went into them.
Jonas was barefoot, and did not mind wetting his feet; so he
waded in, drawing the wagon after him. It was about up to his
ankles all the way. Lucy looked over the side of the wagon, and
felt a little fear as she saw the wheels half under water; but they
went safely through.
Presently they began to descend a path which led them into the
woods. They heard the roaring of the water, which grew louder and
louder as they drew nigh, and then Rollo suddenly stopped and
said,
"Why, father, it is raining here in the woods now."
Lucy listened, and they heard the drops of rain falling upon the
ground all around them; and yet, looking up, they saw that the sky
was almost perfectly clear. Presently they thought that this was
only the drops falling off from the leaves of the trees.
Rollo said he meant to see if it was so, and he ran out of the
path, and took hold of a slender tree with a large top of branches
and leaves, and, looking up to see if any drops would come down, he
gave it a good shake; and, true enough, down came a perfect shower
of drops all into his face and eyes. At first he was astonished at
such an unexpected shower-bath, but he concluded, on the whole, to
laugh, and not cry about it; and he came back wiping his face, and
looking comically enough. All the party laughed a little at his
mishap, and then went on.
In a few minutes more, they came in sight of the foaming brook.
The water was very high; in some places, the banks were overflowed,
and the current swept along furiously, dashing against the rocks,
and whirling round the projecting points.
The children stopped, and gazed upon the scene a little while,
and then Rollo said he was going to sail his boats, which he had
brought in his pocket.
Just then Jonas saw a plank which was lying partly on the bank
and partly in the water, a little up the stream. It had been placed
across the brook some distance above, for a bridge; but the freshet
had brought it away, and it had drifted down to where it then
was.
Jonas said he would find a place for Lucy to stand upon with it.
So he went and pushed off this plank, and let it float down to
where the children were standing; and then he drew it up upon the
shore, and laid it along, so that Lucy could stand upon it safely,
and launch the pea-pod boats.
These boats were soon all borne away rapidly down the stream,
out of sight; and then they threw in sticks and chips, and watched
them as they sailed away, and whirled around in the eddies, or
swept down the rapids. Thus they amused themselves a long time, and
then slowly returned home.






BLUEBERRYING.

"The bower on the mountain."






BLUEBERRYING.









OLD TRUMPETER.
Rollo's mother advised him, when he went to bed the evening
before the day fixed upon for the blueberrying, to rise early the
next morning, and take a good reading lesson before breakfast. She
said he would enjoy himself much more, during the day, if he
performed all his usual duties before he went. Rollo accordingly
arose quite early, and, when he came in to breakfast, had the
satisfaction of telling his father that he had read his morning
lesson, and prepared his basket, and was all ready to go.
He wanted Jonas to go too, and as, the last time when he asked
his father's permission that he should go, he lost his request by
asking it in an improper manner, he determined to be careful this
time.
So he was silent at breakfast time while his father and mother
were talking, and then, watching an opportunity when they seemed
disengaged, he asked his father if Jonas might not go with
them.
"I do not think he can very well, for there is no room for him.
Both the chaises will be full."
"But could not he ride on Old Trumpeter?" said Rollo.
Old Trumpeter was a white horse, that had served the family some
time, but was now rather old, and not a very good traveller.
Rollo's father hesitated a moment, and then said, perhaps he
might. "You may go and tell him that we are going, and that if he
thinks Old Trumpeter will do to carry him, he may go. He will be of
great help to us, if we should get into any difficulty."
Rollo thought of the bears that he expected to see on the
mountain, and ran to tell Jonas. Jonas was glad to go. So he went
and gave Old Trumpeter some oats, and got the saddle and bridle
ready. He also got out a pair of saddle-bags that he always used on
such occasions, and put into them a hatchet, a dipper, a box of
matches, and some rope. On second thoughts, he concluded it would
be best to put these things into the chaise-box, and to put the
saddle-bags on his horse empty, as he might want them to bring
something home in.
After breakfast, Lucy and her father, Rollo's uncle George,
drove up to the door, for they were going too; and in a short time
you might have seen all the party driving away from the
door&mdash;Rollo's father and mother in the first chaise, uncle
George, and Rollo, and Lucy, in the second, and Jonas on Old
Trumpeter behind.
They rode on for a mile or two, and then turned off of the main
road into the woods, and went on by a winding and beautiful road
until they came in sight of a range of mountains, one of which
seemed very high and near.
"Is that Benalgon?" said Rollo.
"I do not know," said his uncle; "I have never been to it
before; but I suppose Jonas can tell."
"I will call him," said Rollo. So he turned round, and kneeled
up upon the seat, so that he could look out behind the chaise, for
the back curtain was up. Lucy did the same, but Jonas was not to be
seen. They looked a little longer, and presently saw him coming
along round a curve in the road. They beckoned to him, and as he
rode up, they saw he had a bush in his hand. He came up to the side
of the chaise, and handed it to Rollo. It was a large
blueberry-bush, covered with beautiful ripe blue berries. Rollo
took them, and admired them very much; and at first he was going to
divide them between Lucy and himself; but they concluded, on the
whole, to send them forward to his mother. Jonas told them the
mountain before them was Benalgon, and rode on to carry the
blueberry-bush to the other chaise. Presently he came back,
bringing it with him, except a small sprig which Rollo's mother had
taken off. The rest she had sent back to the children.
"Well, Jonas," said uncle George, when he got back, "I do not
see but that Old Trumpeter is strong enough to carry you yet."
"O yes, sir," said Jonas, "he is strong enough to carry half a
dozen like me."
"O, uncle George," said Rollo, "let him carry me too with Jonas.
I can ride behind."
"Very well; if you want to ride with him a little while, you
may, if Jonas is willing."
Jonas was, and Rollo got out, and climbed up upon a stump, by
the side of the road. Jonas drove up to the stump, and Rollo
clambered up behind him, with a switch in his hand.
"Now, Jonas," said he, "whenever you want him to go any faster,
you just speak to me, and I will touch him up with my switch."
Jonas said he would, and they jogged along behind the chaise.
Lucy kneeled upon the cushion, and looked out behind, talking with
Rollo.






DEVIATION.
They went on so very quietly for some time, until Jonas said
there was a turn in the road on before them, where there was a
foot-path that led across a ravine, by a nearer way than the
chaise-road, and proposed that Rollo should ask leave for Jonas and
himself to go across on horseback, and wait for the chaises, when
they should come out on the main road.
So they rode up to the chaise, and Rollo put the question to his
uncle George.
His reply was that he could not say any thing about it; Rollo
must go and ask his father.
"Would you go?" said Jonas.
"Yes," said Rollo.
"Well, touch up Old Trumpeter then."
So Rollo applied his switch, and the horse trotted on fast.
Rollo had hard work to hold on, but he clasped his arm tight around
Jonas's waist, and succeeded in keeping his seat.
Rollo's father and mother were riding some distance before them,
but they saw Jonas coming up, and rode slowly, that he might
overtake them.
"Well, Rollo," said his father, "how do you like riding
double?"
"Very much," said Rollo; "and we want you to let Jonas and I cut
across by the horse-path through the valley, and wait for you at
the mill."
"Is there a horse-path across here, Jonas?"
"Yes, sir," said Jonas.
"Is it a good path?"
"It is rather rough, sir, through the woods and bushes; but it
is a pretty good road."
Rollo's father sat hesitating a moment, and then said&mdash;
"You may go, if you choose, but I advise you not to."
"Why do you advise us not to?" said Rollo.
"Why, you may get into some difficulty, and so we get
separated."
"Yes, but," said Rollo, "it is not near so far across, and we
shall have time to get through to the mill long before you come
along."
"Very well, you may do as you please."
"Jonas, what would you do? Would you go, or not?"
"I think I would not go, if your father thinks we had
better not."
"I want to go very much," said Rollo.
"Very well," said his father; "you are willing to go with him, I
suppose, Jonas, are you not?"
"O yes, sir," said Jonas.
"Well," said Rollo, "let us go. We will he very careful, father,
not to get into any difficulty."
So the two chaises rode on, and Jonas and Rollo, in a few
minutes, turned off by a narrow path that struck into the woods.
Just as they were bending down their heads to pass under a great
branch of a tree, Rollo looked along, and saw Lucy waving her
handkerchief to him, as the chaise which she was in disappeared by
a turn of the road.
Rollo at first felt a little uneasy to think that he had
deserted his cousin, as it were. He thought that he should not have
liked it exactly, if she had gone off, and left him alone so in the
chaise. However, it was now too late to repent, and his attention
was attracted by the wild and romantic scene around him. The path
descended obliquely, by a rough, wet, and stony way, through a dark
forest. He heard the sighing of the wind, in the tops of the tall
trees, and the mellow notes of forest birds, far off, and high,
which came rich and sweet to his ear with a peculiar expression of
solitude and loneliness.
The boys rode on, and the path became more and more slippery,
stony, and steep Rollo clung tight to Jonas, and begun to be
somewhat afraid. He would have proposed to go back, but he was
ashamed to do it. After a little time, he asked Jonas whether the
path was as bad as that all the way.
"As bad as this!" said Jonas; "we call this very good. I will
show you the bad road pretty soon."
Rollo looked frightened, but said nothing.
"The road seems more wet than common to-day," said Jonas, "I
suppose on account of the rain yesterday; and I declare," said he,
"I am afraid we shall find the brook up."
"The brook up!" said Rollo.
"Yes&mdash;why did not I think of that before? However, we must
go on now."
"Why?" said Rollo. "Why cannot we go back?"
"O, because we should be too late; besides, there is no danger,
only we may have to wade a little."
As they went on, the mud in the road grew deeper and deeper, and
presently Old Trumpeter's legs sunk far down among roots and mire.
Rollo began to feel more and more alarmed, and heartily wished that
he had taken his father's advice.
Soon alter they came to a place where the path, for some
distance before them, was full of water, deep and miry. Jonas said
he thought that they had better go out upon one side; so he made
the horse step over a log and go in among the trees and bushes. The
branches brushed and scratched Rollo unmercifully, though he bent
down, and leaned over to this side and that, continually, to escape
them. He asked Jonas why this path had not dried, as well as the
main road, where the chaises had gone; and Jonas told him that the
sun and the wind were the great means of drying the open road, but
that this narrow and secluded path was shaded from the sun, and
sheltered from the wind, and that the water consequently remained a
long time among the moss, and roots, and mire.
After a time, they got back into the path again, and, going on a
little farther, they came down to the margin of the brook. They
found that it was "up," as Jonas had feared. At the place
where the path went down and crossed the brook, a deep cut had been
worn in the two opposite banks, and this was filled with water, and
above and below the stream rushed on in a torrent. Jonas hesitated
a moment, and then asked Rollo if he thought he could hold on,
while they we're riding through. Rollo said he was afraid it was so
deep as to drown them. Jonas then said that he might get off and
stand upon a rock by the side of the path, while he rode through,
first, to see how it was, and that then he would come back for
him.
So Rollo got off, in fear and trembling, and stood on the rock,
while Jonas urged his horse into the water. Old Trumpeter did not
much like this kind of travelling, but Jonas half persuaded and
half compelled him to go through. When he was in the middle, the
water came up so high, that Jonas was obliged to lift up his feet
to keep them from being wet. Presently, however, it became more
shoal, as the horse walked slowly along; and at last he fairly
reached the dry ground, and stood dripping on the bank.
Rollo was glad to see that the water was no deeper, but was
still afraid to go over. He told Jonas he could not go over
I here, and that he must go back with him.
"No," said Jonas, "that would not be right."
"Why," said Rollo, "we can ride fast, and overtake them."
"Not very soon," said Jonas. "If we go back now, they will get
to the mill before us, and then will be very anxious and unhappy,
thinking that something has happened to us; and perhaps your father
will come through here after us. Now it was your own plan, coming
across here, and you ought not to make other people suffer by it.
Your father advised you not to come."
"I know it," said Rollo; "what a foolish boy I was! I shall
certainly be drowned."
"O no," said Jonas, "there is no real danger, or I should not
make you go;" and so saying, he came back slowly through the water.
"See," said he, "it is not very deep."






LITTLE MOSETTE.
After some further persuasion Rollo got on behind him, and they
began to in make their way slowly through the water again. Old
Trumpeter staggered along, but not very unsteadily on the whole,
until he got a little past the middle, when he blundered upon a
stone on the bottom, which he could not see, and fell down on his
knees. Jonas caught up his feet, in an instant, and Rollo had his
already drawn up behind him, and they both grasped the saddle
convulsively. The horse happened to regain his feet again in a
moment, so that they contrived to hold on; and in a few minutes
they were drawn out safely upon the shore, without even getting
their feet wet.
"Well, Old Trumpeter," said Jonas, "you have done pretty well
for you, and you have got the mire washed off your legs, at any
rate. But, Rollo, what is that?"
He pointed back, as he said this, to a little tuft floating
round and round in a small eddy, made by a turn of the brook, just
above where they had crossed. He turned his horse towards it. "It
is a bird's nest," said he.
"So it is," said Rollo; "and I verily believe there is a little
bird in it."
 img id="pic10" src="images/illus10.png" alt=
"Jonas drawing the nest to the shore.">
Jonas jumped off of the horse, handed the bridle to Rollo, and
took up a long stick lying on the ground, and very gently and
cautiously drew the nest, in to the shore. He took it up with great
care, and brought it to Rollo.
There was a little bird in it, scarcely fledged. Jonas said he
believed it was a robin, and that it must have been washed off from
its place on some bush, by the freshet in the brook. The bottom of
the nest was soaked through by the water, as if it had been
floating some time; and the little bird kept opening its mouth
wide. The poor little thing was hungry, and heard Jonas and Rollo,
and thought they were its mother, come to give it something to
eat.
"What shall we do with him?" said Rollo.
"He will die if we leave him here," said Jonas, "for he has lost
his mother now. I think we had better carry him home, if we can,
and feed him, till he is old enough to fly."
"He is hungry," said Rollo; "let us feed him now."
"We have not any thing to feed him with. Perhaps I can catch a
fly, or a grasshopper."
"O, that will not do," said Rollo; "you might as well kill him
as kill a grasshopper."
Jonas could not reply to this, and they concluded to carry nest
and all carefully to the mill, and show it to Rollo's father there.
But how to carry it was the difficulty. If either of them undertook
to hold it in one hand, he was afraid the bird might be jolted out;
and neither of them had but one hand to spare, for Rollo must have
one hand to hold on with, and Jonas one to drive. At last Jonas
took off his cap, and placed it bottom upwards on the saddle before
him, and put the nest, with the bird in it, in that, and then drove
carefully along. The road grew much smoother and better after they
passed the brook; and, after going on a short distance farther,
they came in sight of the mill.
They had been detained so long that the chaises had reached the
mill before, them; and the party in the chaises were looking out
down the path where they expected the boys were to come out,
watching for them with considerable interest:
"There they come at last," said Lucy, as she perceived a
movement among the bushes, and saw Old Trumpeter's white head
coming forward.
"Yes," said Rollo's mother, "but they have met with some
accident. Jonas has lost his cap."
By this time the boys had emerged from the bushes, and were
coming along the path slowly, Jonas bareheaded, and Rollo holding
on carefully. Lucy saw that Jonas was holding something before him,
on the saddle, and wondered what it was. Rollo's mother said she
was afraid they had got hurt.
As soon as they came within hearing Rollo heard his father's
voice calling out to him,
"Rollo, what is the matter? Have you got into any
difficulty?"
"Yes, sir," said Rollo; "we had some difficulty; and I should be
sorry I did not take your advice, only then we should not have
found this little bird."
"What bird?" said they all.
By this time, they had come up near the chaises, and Jonas
carefully lifted the birdsnest out of his cap, and held it so that
they could all see it, while Rollo told them the story. They all
looked much pleased but Lucy seemed in delight. She wanted to have
it go in their chaise, and asked Rollo to let her hold the nest in
her lap.
Rollo did not answer very directly, for he was busy looking at
the bird,&mdash;seeing him open his mouth, and wishing he had
something to give him to eat.
"Father," said he, "what shall we feed him with? Jonas was going
to catch a grasshopper, but I thought that would not be right."
"Why not?" said uncle George.
"Because," said Rollo, "he has as good a right to his life as
the bird, has not he, father?"
"Not exactly," said his father: "a bird is an animal of much
higher grade than a grasshopper, and is probably much more sensible
of pain and pleasure, and his life is of more value; just as a man
is a much higher animal than a bird. It would be right to kill a
bird to save a man's life, even if he were only an animal; and so
it would be right to destroy a grasshopper, or a worm, to save a
robin."
"But I read in a book once," said Lucy, "that, when we tread on
a worm, he feels as much pain in being killed as a giant
would."
"I do not think it is true," said he. "I think that there is a
vast diversity among the different animals, in respect to their
sensibility to pain, according to their structure, and the delicacy
of their organization. I think a crew of a fishing-vessel might
catch a whole cargo of mackerel, and not cause as much pain as one
of their men would suffer in having his leg bitten off by a
shark."
"Well, father," said Rollo, "do you think we had better give him
a grasshopper?"
"O no," said Lucy; "a grasshopper would not be good to eat, he
has got so many elbows sticking out. Let us give him some
blueberries."
"O yes," said Rollo, "that would be beautiful."
So he slid down off of Old Trumpeter's back, and ran to the side
of the road to see if he could not find some blueberries.
He brought a few in his hand, and his father took them, saying
that he would feed the bird for him. He squeezed out pulp of the
berries, and then made a chirping sound, when the bird opened his
mouth, and he fed him with the soft pulp, and threw away the skins.
After giving the bird two or three berries in this way, they put
him back into the nest, and gave the nest to Lucy to hold in her
lap, and all the party prepared to go on.
They rode along about a mile farther, and then came to the place
where they must leave the horses, and prepare to ascend the
mountain on foot. They unharnessed them, so that they might stand
more quietly, and then fastened them to trees by the side of the
road.
While they were thus taking care of their horses, Rollo and Lucy
were standing by, with Rollo's mother looking at the bird.
"What are you going to do with him, Rollo?" said his mother.
"Why, I should like to carry him home, and keep him, if you are
willing."
"I am, on one condition."
"What is that?"
"You must keep him in a cage with the door always open, so that,
as soon as he is old enough to fly away, he may go if he
chooses."
"Then he will certainly fly away, and we shall lose him
forever," said Lucy.
"That is the only condition," replied Rollo's mother.
"But why, mother," said he, "why may we not keep him shut up
safe?"
"If I were to tell you the reasons now, they would not satisfy
you, you are so eager to keep him. I think you had better determine
to comply with the condition, good-humoredly, and say no more about
it, but try to think of a name for him."
"Well, mother, what do you think would be a good name?"
"I do not know: you and Lucy must think of one."
Just then uncle George finished tying his horse, and came along
to where the children were standing, and, hearing their
conversation, and finding that Lucy and Rollo were perplexed about
a name, he told them he thought they might, not improperly, call
him Noah, as, like Noah, by floating in a sort of ark, he was saved
from a flood.
"I think he was more like Moses than Noah," said Lucy.
"Why?" said her father.
"Because Moses was a little thing when they found him, and then
the ark of bulrushes was something like a birdsnest. I think you
had better name him Moses, Rollo," said she.
Rollo seemed a little at a loss: he said he thought he was a
good deal like Moses, but then he did not think that Moses was a
very pretty name for a bird.
"Do you think it is, mother?" said he.
"I do not know but that it would do very well. You might alter
it a little; call him Mosette, if you think that would be any
better for a bird's name."
Rollo and Lucy repeated the name Mosette to themselves several
times, and concluded that they should like it very much. By this
time, the horses were all ready, and Jonas recommended that they
should hide Mosette away somewhere, until they returned from the
mountain, for it would be troublesome to them, and somewhat
dangerous to the bird, to carry him up and down.
The children approved of this plan, though they were rather
unwilling to part with the bird, at all. They went just into the
bushes, and found a very secret place, by the corner of a large
rock, where the shrubs and wild flowers grew thick, so that it
would be entirely out of sight.






GOING UP.
They then set forward, the children in advance of the rest.
Jonas walked with Rollo and Lucy, and he had round his waist a
broad leather belt, which he always wore on such occasions, and
which had, on one side, his hatchet and knife, and on the other a
sort of bag or pocket, containing several things, such as matches,
a little dipper, &amp;c.
Rollo's father and mother, and his uncle George, walked along
behind them. The way was, for some distance, a sort of cart-path,
too steep and rough for a chaise, but hard and dry, and pretty
comfortable walking. Rollo and Lucy asked Jonas if he would not
tell them a story, as they went along, to beguile the way.
Jonas began a story, about a boy that lived a long time on a
mountain alone, but he had not proceeded far, before they heard a
voice behind, calling them. They looked buck, and saw that Rollo's
father was beckoning them to stop.
They waited till he came up, and he told them he wanted to give
them their orders for the day; and they were rules, he said, which
ought to be observed on all berrying expeditions, by children.
"First" said he, "always keep in sight of me. For
this purpose, watch me all the time, when we are stepping, and keep
before, rather than behind, when we are walking.
"Second. Take no unnecessary steps, but keep in the right
path, and walk slowly and steadily there, so as to save your
strength. Otherwise you will get tired out very soon.
"Third. Do not touch any flower or berry that you see,
except blueberries, without first showing them to one of us."
The children listened to these rules, and promised to obey them,
and then walked on. They tried to walk slowly and steadily,
listening to Jonas's story. They turned off, after a time, into a
narrower and steeper path, and ascended, stepping from stone to
stone The trees and bushes hung over their heads, making the walk
shady and cool.
After slowly ascending in this way, for some time, they came out
of the woods into an opening of rocky ground, and patches of blue
berry-bushes. They saw, also, at some distance before them, three
or four boys, sitting upon a rock, with pails and baskets in their
hands, talking and laughing loud. They did not take much notice of
them, but walked on quietly. They were going on directly towards
them, but Rollo's father called them, and pointed for them to turn
off to the right, round a rocky precipice which was in that
direction.
The children were turning accordingly, when they heard a shout
from the boys before them,&mdash;"Hallo,&mdash;come this way, and
we will show you where the blueberries are."
"Father," said Rollo, as he stopped and turned round to his
father, "the boys say they will show us the blueberries, out that
way: shall we go and see?"
"No," said his father in a low voice, so that the boys did not
hear. "No: go the way I told you."
They went along, and presently got round the precipice out of
sight of I he boys again. They walked slowly until their parents
overtook them.
"Father," said Rollo, "why could you not let us go out with
those boys? They said they were thickest out there."
"Because," said he, "I presume they are not good boys, and I do
not want you to have any thing to do with them."
"But, father, they must be good boys, or they would not want to
show us the blueberries. If they were bad, selfish boys, they would
want to keep all the good places to themselves."
If Rollo had only asked his father, in a modest manner, how it
could be that the boys were bad, when they wanted to show him the
best place for blueberries, it would have been very proper; but his
manner of speaking showed a silly confidence in his own opinion,
which was very wrong. His father, however, did not attempt to
reason with him, but only said,
"I think they are bad boys, for I overheard them using bad
language; and I wish you to have nothing to do with them."
He then found a good place for them to begin to gather their
berries. It was a beautiful spot of open ground, between the thick
woods on one side, and a broken, rocky precipice on the other.
Uncle George took Jonas forward alone, until they were out of
sight, and presently returned without him. Rollo asked where Jonas
was gone, and his uncle told him that that was a secret at present.
They heard, soon after, the strokes of his hatchet in the woods, on
before them, but could not imagine what he could be doing.
Thus things went on very pleasantly, and they gathered a large
quantity of berries. There was, indeed, in the course of the day, a
serious difficulty between Rollo and the bad boys; and there is an
account of it given in the next story of "TROUBLE ON THE MOUNTAIN."
With Ibis exception, every thing went on well until about, noon,
when Rollo observed that Jonas had been missing a long time.






THE SECRET OUT.
"Where is Jonas, all this time?" said Rollo to Lucy.
Lucy said that he had been busy, a long time, doing something
over beyond some rocks, but she did not know what, for her father
told her she must not go to see. Rollo wondered what the secret
was, and he was just going to ask his father to let him go and see
what Jonas was doing, when they saw him coming out from the bushes.
He came up to Rollo's father, and told him that it was all ready.
Then Rollo's father called to all the company, and told them it was
time to stop gathering berries, and they might take up their
baskets and follow him.
The baskets and pails were heavy and full, and the whole party
walked along, carrying them carefully towards the place where Jonas
had come from. Rollo's Hither led the way. They entered into a
little thicket, and passed through it by a narrow path. They came
out presently into a sort of opening, on a brow of the mountain. On
one side they could look down upon a vast extent of country,
exhibiting a beautiful variety of forests, rivers, villages, and
farms. On the other side was a rocky precipice, rising abruptly to
a considerable height, and then sloping off towards the summit of
the mountain. They walked along a few steps on a smooth surface of
the rock, between patches of grass and blueberry-bushes, until Lucy
and Rollo ran forward to a brook which came foaming down the
precipice, and then, after tumbling along over rocks a little way,
took another foaming leap down the mountain, and was lost among the
trees below.

The party all stepped carefully over this brook, and then walked
along up the bank on the opposite side until they came to the
precipice. Here they were surprised and pleased to see a large
bower built, in front of a little sort of cavern or recess in the
rock. Jonas had built it of large limbs of trees and bushes, which
he had leaned up against the rock, in such a manner as to enclose a
large space within. There was an opening left round on the farther
side, next the rock, and they all went round mid went
in&mdash;Rollo first, then Lucy, then the others. They found that
smooth and clean logs and stones were arranged around the sides of
the bower; and in the middle, on a carpet of leaves, was very
abundant provision for a rustic dinner.
There was bread, and butter, and ham, and gingerbread, and pie,
and glasses for water from the brook. Rollo and Lucy wondered how
all those things could have got up the mountain. Presently,
however, they recollected that, when they were coming up, Jonas had
two covered baskets to bring, and they thought, at the time, that
they seemed to be heavy.
Thus the day passed away, and towards evening they came down the
mountain. Some remarkable things happened when they were coming
down, which will be related in the story called "TROUBLE ON THE
MOUNTAIN."






TROUBLE ON THE MOUNTAIN.

TROUBLE ON THE MOUNTAIN.









BOASTING.
"How pleasant it is here!" said Rollo to his cousin Lucy, as
they were gathering blueberries high up on old Mount Benalgon, the
day they went up with Rollo'S father and mother, and uncle; "and
how thick the blueberries are, Lucy!"
"Yes," said Lucy, "they are very thick, I think; and how far we
can see now, we are up here so high! I wish we were up on that
great high rock."
Rollo looked where Lucy pointed, and he saw, away above them, a
rocky summit projecting out from the mountain. The front of the
rock was ragged and precipitous, but it was flat and mossy upon the
top, and firs and other evergreen trees grew there, some of them
hanging over the edge.
"I wish I could get up there," said Lucy.
"I wish I could too," said Rollo. "I should like to climb up one
of those trees which hangs over, and then I could look down."
"O, Rollo," said Lucy, "you would not dare to climb up one of
those trees."
"Yes, I should dare to," said Rollo.
Rollo was sometimes a proud, boasting boy, pretending that he
could do great things, and talking very largely. This was one of
his greatest faults; and whenever he seemed to be in this boasting
mood, he almost always got into some difficulty after it. There is
a text in the Bible that was proved true, very often, in Rollo's
case. It is this&mdash;"Pride cometh before destruction, and a
haughty spirit before a fall." Rollo had a sad Tall this day,
though it was not from that high rock. It was a different sort of a
fall from that, as we shall presently see.
"Lucy," said he again, "I do not believe but that I could get up
upon that rock myself. I can climb rocks."
"O no, you could not," said Lucy.
"Why, yes, I see a way."
"Which way?"
"O, round by that great black log There is a path there through
the bushes."
"O no," said Lucy, "you could not get up there. But there are
some boys by that log; what boys are they?"
Rollo looked. They were some boys which they had seen coming up
the mountain, and Rollo's father had warned him not to go near
them. They had wanted Rollo to go with them before, but his father
had forbidden it. Rollo wanted to go, and now he was glad to see
them again; but Lucy was sorry.






GETTING IN TROUBLE.
The blueberries were very thick and large, and the bottoms of
the baskets were soon covered with them. Each one picked where he
found them most plenty.
Rollo and Lucy kept pretty near together, talking, and gradually
strayed away to some distance from the rest of the party. After a
little while, Rollo looked up, and saw the three boys pretty near
them. As soon as Lucy saw them so near, she moved along towards
their parents; and Rollo ought to have done so too, but he remained
where he was, and presently one of the boys came up to him.
"Why did you not come up where we were?" said he. "They were
thicker out there."
"My father would not let me," said Rollo.
"O, come along," said the boy; "he will not care. Besides, he
will not know it. He is busy picking by himself. He does not mind
where you are."
Rollo thought this was not exactly the way that a good boy would
speak of obeying a father, but he wanted very much to see the place
where the berries were so much thicker.
"How far is it?" said he to the boy.
"O, it is only a little way-just around that rock."
By this time the other two boys came up, and they talked with
Rollo a little while, and endeavored to persuade him to go. He said
finally that he would go and ask his father. So he left his basket,
and went and asked his father if he might just go with those boys
round the rock. He said the blueberries were much thicker around
there, and also that he had been talking with the boys, and he was
sure they were good boys.
"No, Rollo," said his father, decidedly, "I cannot think that
any boys that use bad language can be good boys, or safe companions
for you. I had rather you would keep with us. If they speak to you,
answer them civilly; but the less you have to say to them or do
with them, the better. In fact, I had rather you would not go back
to them at all."
"I must," said Rollo, "to get my basket."
He accordingly returned to his basket, and told the boys that
his father preferred that he should stay where he was.
The biggest boy of the three was a ragged and dirty-looking boy;
the others called him Jim, and he talked with Rollo a good deal.
Rollo's conscience reproved him for not leaving them, and going
back to his father; but he wanted to stay and hear their talk, and
he quieted his conscience by saying to himself that his father told
him to treat them civilly. At first the boys were careful what they
said to Rollo; but at length Jim grew more and more hold. He used
language which Rollo knew was wrong, and he told Rollo that he was
a fool to stick so close to his father; that he was big enough to
find his way alone all over the mountain, if he was of a mind
to.
All this Rollo was silly enough to believe, and, as his father
only required him to keep in sight, he thought he would show the
boys that he was not so much afraid as they thought he was; and so
hi gradually moved off farther and farther from his parents, as he
went on gradually filling up his basket. Lucy, in the mean time,
went nearer and nearer to them, and in a short time was safely
gathering her blueberries by her aunt's side.
Things went on so for an hour. Rollo's mother asked his father
whether he had not better call Rollo to them.
"No," said he; "I have told him his duty once, plainly, and now,
if he does not do it, he must take the consequences. I believe I
shall leave him to himself."
The boys went on talking to one another and to Rollo, telling
various stories about their running away from school, stealing
apples, and such things. Rollo was much interested in listening to
them, though he knew, all the time, that he was doing wrong. But he
had not the courage to leave them abruptly, as he ought to have
done, and go back to his father.
Rollo took a great deal of pains with the berries he picked; he
chose the largest and ripest, and was very careful not to get in
any sticks and leaves. His basket was small, and he intended, as
soon as he got it full, to carry it carefully to his mother, and
pour his berries into her large tin pail. He was succeeding finely
in this, but then he had insensibly strayed away so far from his
father, that now he was entirely out of his sight.
At length, as Jim was sitting on a log to rest himself, as he
said, he saw a little bird alight on the branch of a black stump
near.
"Hash," said he; "there is a Bob-a-link. See how I will fix
him."
So saying, he picked up a stone, and was going to throw it.
Rollo begged him not to kill that pretty little bird but he paid
no attention to what Rollo said. He threw the stone with all his
force; but fortunately it did not hit the bird. It struck the limb
that the bird was perched upon, and shivered it to fragments, and
the bird flew away, terrified.
"Now, what did you do that for?" said Rollo; "you might have hit
him."
"Hit him!" said he; "I meant to hit him, to be sure."
"But what good does it do to kill little birds? I found one this
morning, and I would not kill him for any thing."
"Where did you find him?" said Jim.
Rollo then told the boys all about his finding a little bird, in
its nest floating in the brook, and about their naming him Mosette;
as is described in the story called "BLUEBERRYING;" and Jim said,
if he had found him, he would have put him on a fence, for a mark
to fire stones at. "I would have made him peep, I tell you," said
he.
Rollo said he would not have him killed on any account. He was
going to carry him home, and feed him, and tame him.
"But where is he now?" said Jim.
"O, we hid him behind a stone, down at the foot of the mountain,
where our horses are tied."
"But how can you find him again?" said Jim.
"O," said Rollo, "we know; it was behind the corner of a stone,
just in the bushes, where we tied the horse."
Jim winked at the other boys when Rollo said this, though Rollo
did not see it. He was vexed with Rollo, because he reproved him
for stoning the bird.
"I would set him up for a mark, if I had him," said Jim. "I wish
I had been there when you found him; I would have taken him away
from you."
"No, you would not have taken him away. Jonas would not let
you."
"Jonas! who is Jonas? and what do you think I care for Jonas?"
said he.
He then came up to Rollo, and looked into his basket, and saw it
nearly full of large ripe blueberries.
"And I believe," said he, "that you have stolen some of my
berries out of my basket, while I have been sitting here."
"No, I have not," said Rollo. "I have not touched your
basket."
"You have," said Jim, fiercely, "and I will have them back
again. Besides, I put some into yours, while you went to your
father. So half the berries in your basket are mine."
This was a lie; but bad boys, like Jim, will always lie, when
they have any thing to gain by it. He came up to Rollo, and began
to pull his basket away from him. Rollo struggled against him, and
began to cry. But Jim was too strong for him: he tipped his basket
over, poured a great many of the berries into his own basket, and
the rest were spilled over on to the ground. Then, angry at Rollo's
screams and cries, he trampled on all the berries that were on the
ground, and was beginning to run away. Rollo caught hold of the
skirt of his coat, screaming all the time for his father. Jim
turned round, and struck Rollo with his fist, knocked him down, and
then he and the other boys set off, as fast as they could run,
through the bushes; and they disappeared just as Rollo's father and
Jonas came hastening to his aid.

"Jim strikes Rollo to the ground.">
They raised Rollo up, and his father took him in his arms to
carry him away. He saw that there had been some serious difficulty
with the bad boys, but he did not ask Rollo any thing about it,
then; for he knew that he could not talk intelligibly till he had
done crying. Rollo laid his head down on his father's shoulder, as
he walked along, and sobbed bitterly.






A TEST OF PENITENCE.
His father carried him back to where his mother and uncle were,
who were coming towards him looking anxiously.
They presently got pretty near them, Rollo still continuing to
cry. His father then said to him,
"Rollo, be still a moment. I want to speak to you."
When he first took Rollo up, he did not command him to be still,
for he knew that it would do no good. He was then so overwhelmed
with pain and terror, that he could not help crying; and his father
never commanded impossibilities. By this time, however, the pain,
and the immediate terror, had so far subsided, that his father knew
he could now control himself, and Rollo knew that he must obey. He
accordingly stopped crying aloud, and tried to listen to his
father.
"Rollo," said his father, "I pity you very much. I warned you
against this bad company, and now I perceive you have got into some
difficulty with them; but I cannot hear your story about it till we
get home. It is your own fault that has brought you into trouble;
and now you must not extend your trouble over all our party, and
spoil our happiness, as you have your own. I must go and put you by
yourself, until you get entirely composed and pleasant, and then
you may join us again."
"But, father," said Rollo, beginning to cry afresh at the
thoughts of the boys' treatment of him, "they came up to me,
and&mdash;and&mdash;"
"Stop, Rollo," said his father. "Be still. You cannot tell the
story intelligibly now, and if you could, I should not be willing
to listen to it. You must not say any thing about it, unless you
are questioned, until we get home."
By this time they came up pretty near the place where the rest
of the party were; but his father did not take him there. He turned
aside, and, putting Rollo down, he led him along to a smooth log,
which lay among some old trees, close by, and told him to sit
there, until he was entirely composed and pleasant again, and then
to come to him, or to go to picking berries again, just as he
pleased.
Rollo sat on the log, for some time, with his empty basket by
his side, mourning over his sorrows. Lucy came to him, and
endeavored to console him. She begged him not to cry; and she
poured out half of her own berries into his basket, and told him
that they could soon fill it full again, if he would come with her
to a good thick place she had found. Rollo became gradually quiet
and composed, and walked along with Lucy.
Lucy had indeed found a place where the berries were very thick
and large, and Rollo determined to be as industrious as possible.
They worked away very busily for half an hour, and Rollo gradually
recovered his spirits.
His mother watched him from time to time, and when she saw that
he was good-humored again, she said to his father,
"Rollo seems to be picking his berries very pleasantly. I rather
think he is sorry for his conduct."
"Yes, I see he is getting good-humored again, but I am
afraid he is not truly penitent. It is easier forget a sin,
than to be sorry for it. It is very easy, however, for us to
ascertain."
"How can we ascertain?" asked his mother.
"Why, if you should go and ask him about it, if he is really
penitent, he will be troubled most to think of his disobedience in
going; into the bad company; but if he is not penitent, he will not
think of that, but only go to scolding about the bad boys."
"That is true," said she. "I have a great mind to go and try
him."
Rollo's father thought it would be a good plan, and she,
accordingly, walked along towards Rollo slowly, gathering berries
as she went.
Rollo saw her coming, and said, "Here is mother, Lucy; let us go
and give her our berries."
So saying, he carried his basket up to her very pleasantly, and
said, "Here, mother; see, here are all these berries I have been
picking for you."
"Ah," said she, "did you pick all these for me?"
"E&mdash;h&mdash;no," said he; "not all; Lucy gave me some."
"Well, Lucy, I am very much obliged to you, and I am glad to see
that you, Rollo, are pleasant again; I am sorry you went and got
into difficulty with those boys."
"They came and took away my berries," said he, "and struck
me&mdash;that great ugly Jim."
The feelings of vexation and anger against the bad boys began to
rise again in Rollo's mind, the moment he began to talk about them,
and he was just going to cry. His mother stopped him, saying,
"You need not tell me about him any more. I see how it is."
"How what is?" said Rollo.
"How it is about your being sorry. Your father told me that, if
you were truly penitent for what happened about those boys, I
should find you, when I came to talk with you about it, grieved for
your own fault, and if you were not penitent, you would only
be angry at theirs. I see which it is."
Rollo was silent a moment. He felt the truth and justice of the
distinction; but, like all boys who are not sorry for the wrong
they have done, he could not resist the temptation to try to
justify himself by throwing the blame on others. So he began to
tell her something more about "that cross old Jim," but she
interrupted him, and told him she did not wish to hear any thing
about that "cross old Jim." He was not her boy, she said, and she
had nothing to do with him or his faults.
She then went to talking about other things, and helped Rollo
begin to fill his basket again. He showed her where the berries
were thickest, and led her round behind a rock to show her a
beautiful wild flower that he had found; he said he did not bring
it to her, for his father had told him not to touch any flowers or
berries that they did not know, for fear they might be
poisonous.
After a little while, Rollo's mother left him and Lucy together,
and went back lo where his father and uncle were.
"Well," said they, "how did you find Rollo?"
"Pleasant, but not penitent," said she Lucy and Rollo
went on gathering berries some time after Rollo's mother left him,
in silence. Rollo felt rather unhappy, but he was not subdued. His
heart was still proud and unhumbled, and after a time, he said to
Lucy,
"It seems to me very strange that my mother does not think those
boys were to blame any for doing so."
"She does think they were to blame, Rollo, I know."
"No, she does not; she will not hear me say any thing about
them."
Lucy did not answer, because she knew it would do no good to
dispute with Rollo, while he was so unreasonable. Rollo ought to
have been willing to have seen his fault, and to have felt truly
sorry for it; but he was not, and so Lucy thought it was better not
to talk with him about it at all. If he had been truly sorry, and
had gone and told his father so, and asked his forgiveness, he
would have been happy again.
But as it was, he was not happy. The recollection of his
disobedience and sin would remain in his mind, and though he tried
to talk, and laugh, and play, as usual, his mind was not much at
ease. In fact, he was secretly glad when the time arrived for going
home.
The party all gathered together on a smooth piece of ground,
about the middle of the afternoon, to make their arrangements for
going down the mountain. They put their baskets, filled beautifully
with blueberries, together on the grass, while they sat on the
stones and logs around, to rest a little before walking down.

Then Rollo's father arranged the order of march. Jonas was to go
first, with two of the heaviest baskets of berries. Next came Lucy,
with her little basket about two thirds full, and with leaves and
some beautiful pieces of moss she had found, put in upon the top.
Then came Rollo's mother leaning on his uncle's arm. His uncle had
a basket of berries in his other hand. Finally, Rollo and his
father walked together behind, with each a basket in his hand.
Thus they walked along down the steep path, until they began to
enter the bushes. Rollo's father had made this arrangement so that
he might have an opportunity to talk with him about the difficulty
with the boys, for he thought, on the whole, it would be better to
talk with him now than to wait till they got home.
After they had walked along a little way, Rollo's father asked
him whether he had a good time blueberrying?
"Why, yes, sir," said Rollo, "pretty good."
"Have you seen any thing more of those boys?"
"No, sir."
"Your mother went to talk with you, and said you did not seem
very sorry for your fault."
"Why, father," said Rollo, "I did not do any thing to the boys
at all: it was all their fault, entirely."
"I don't suppose you did do any thing wrong towards them,
but you committed a great fault in respect to me."
"What fault?" said Rollo.
"Disobedience."
"Why, father, how? You did not tell me to stay close by
you."
"And is a boy guilty of disobedience only when he does what his
father forbids in words?"
"I suppose so," said Rollo.
"What is disobedience?" asked his father.
"Why, it is doing what you tell me not to do; is it not?"
"That is not a sufficient definition of it; for suppose you were
out there in the bushes, and I was to beckon you to come here, and
you should not come, would not that be disobedience?"
"Why, yes, sir."
"And yet I should not tell you to come."
"No, sir."
"And so, if I were to shake my head at you when you were doing
any thing wrong, and you wore to continue doing it, that would be
disobedience."
Rollo admitted that it would. "So that it is not necessary that
I should tell you in words what my wishes are: if I express
them in any way so that you plainly understand it, that is enough.
The most important orders that are given by men, are often given
without any words."
"How, father?"
"Why, at sea, sometimes, where there is a great fleet of ships,
and the admiral, who commands them all, is in one of them. Now, if
he wants all the fleet to sail in any way; or if he wishes to have
some one, vessel come near to his, or go back home, or go away to
any other part of the world; or if he wants any particular person
in the fleet to come on board his vessel,&mdash;he does not send an
order in words; he only hoists flags of a particular kind
upon the masts of his vessel, and they all obey them.
"Now, suppose," continued he, "one of the ships did not sail as
he wished, and when he called the captain to account for it, he
should say that he was not guilty of disobedience, because he did
not tell him to sail so."
Rollo laughed, and said he thought that would not be a very good
excuse.
"Well, it is just such an excuse as yours. I did not positively
command you not to go near the boys, or not to have any
conversation with them at all, though I expressed my wish that you
would not, so that you could not help understanding it."
Rollo could not deny that this was so.
"But that is not the only case of disobedience. For you did one
thing which was contrary to my express command in
words."
Rollo looked concerned, and said he was sure he did not know
it.
"I told you not to go out of my sight."
"Well, but, father," said Rollo eagerly, in reply, "I am sure I
did not mean to. I was picking berries so busy, I did not observe
where I was."
"I know you were, and that was the disobedience; for when I
command you to keep in sight of me, that means that you must take
good care that you do mind where you are. Suppose I were to
tell Jonas that he might go and take a walk, but that he must be
sure to come back in half an hour, and he should go, and pay no
attention to the time, and so not come back until three quarters of
an hour; would that be obedience?"
"No, sir; but it would not be so bad as it would be if he should
stay away when he knew that the time was out."
"No, it would not be so wilful an act of disobedience, but it
would be disobedience, notwithstanding. You see, Rollo," he
continued, "when I tell you or any boy to come back in half an
hour, there are two things implied in the command&mdash;first, that
you should notice the time, and, secondly, that you should
come back when the time is out. Now, you may disobey the command by
neglecting either of these."
"Yes, sir," said Rollo, "I see we may, but I did not think of it
before."
"No, I presume you did not," said his father; "but I want you to
understand it, and remember it after this forever. You have
disobeyed, to-day, in two ways, in which boys are very apt to
disobey, when they do not mean to do it wilfully. I will tell you
what the principles are, again, so that you can remember and tell
me when I ask you.
"1. Boys must take care to comply with their parents'
directions, if they are expressed in any way whatsoever; and,
"2. When directed to do any thing in a particular time or way,
they must see to it themselves, that they notice and keep
in mind the circumstances which they are required to attend
to."
Rollo said he would try to remember it, and as he seemed
attentive and docile, his father did not talk with him any more
about his fault at that time. Besides, they came now to some very
rough places in the path, and Rollo's father had to lift Lucy over
them.
Lucy spilled some of her berries in one place, and Rollo was
going to help her pick them up, but Jonas said they had better
leave them for the birds, and walk on.
"So we will, Lucy," said Rollo, "and I rather think that Mosette
is hungry by this time."
"Yes," said Jonas, "and what are you going to do with
Mosette?"
"O, put him in a cage, and bring him up tame," said Rollo. "I
mean to teach him to eat out of my hand. I shall treat him very
kindly, though he is my little prisoner."
"I would give: him the liberty of the yard, if I were you," said
some one behind, laughing.
Rollo looked round. It was his uncle George, walking close
behind him.
"What is the liberty of the yard?" said Rollo.
"Why, when men intend to treat a prisoner kindly, they
leave the prison door open, and let him walk about the yard; and
this is called letting him have the liberty of the yard; and
sometimes they let them go over half the town."
"Do you think I had better do so with Mosette?" said Rollo.
"Yes," said his uncle George; "leave his cage open, and let him
go where he pleases."
"O, he would fly entirely away," said Rollo.
"Perhaps not, if you should feed him well, and treat him very
kindly. He might like his cage better than any nest."
"I shall treat him as kindly as I can," said Rollo; "only think,
Jonas, that Jim said, if he had found him, he should have
set him up upon the fence for a mark to fire stones at!"
"Jim said so?" said Jonas; "how did Jim know any thing about
it?"
"Why&mdash;e&mdash;h&mdash;why&mdash;I told him," said
Rollo.
"What did you tell him for?"
"O, because," said Rollo, "we were talking, and I told him."
"I hope you did not tell him where we hid Mosette, behind the
rock."
"Why&mdash;yes," said Rollo, "I believe I did."
"Then I am afraid you will never see poor Mosette again," said
Jonas.
"Why," said Rollo, "you don't think that he would go and get
him."
"I don't know," said Jonas, "what he would do; but I should not
have wanted to tell such a boy any thing about him."
Rollo began to be alarmed. He went back to his father, and asked
him to let him and Jonas go on before the rest, to see if their
bird was safe. His father told him he might go. "But," said he, "I
am afraid you have lost your bird; when a boy allows himself to get
into bad company, he does not know how many troubles he plunges
himself into."
Rollo and Jonas ran on, and soon disappeared among the trees.
Rollo found it hard to keep up, as the road was not very smooth,
though they had got down the steepest part of the mountain. Jonas
kept hold of Rollo's hand, and went on running and walking
alternately, until they got down to the end of the trees and
bushes, and then they came out in sight of the place where the
horses were tied.
It was fortunate for poor Mosette, and for Rollo too, that they
did thus run on before, for it happened that Jim, and the boys with
him, had come down the mountain by another road, and were just
going up to the place as Jonas and Rollo came out of the woods.
"There they are," said Jonas. "You stay here; I must run on."
And he let go of Rollo's hand, sprang forward, and ran with all his
might. Rollo tried to follow, but soon stopped and looked on.
Jim and his boys did not see Jonas coming, and they went to work
looking around the bushes and stones after Mosette. In a few
minutes, one smaller boy came out from the bushes, close by the
place where Rollo recollected the nest was hid, with something in
his hand, and Rollo could distinctly hear him calling out,
"Here he is, Jim&mdash;I have got him, Jim."
Just that moment, Jonas came running up among the boys, calling
out,
"Let that bird alone!&mdash;Let that bird alone!" The boys,
terrified at this unexpected onset, started and ran in every
direction. The boy who had the nest, dropped it upon the ground,
and dodged back into the bushes. Jonas took it up carefully, put
little Mosette, who had fallen out, back in the nest, and walked
out into the road to meet Rollo, who was coming down as fast as he
could come, on the other side.
They saw Jim and his comrades no more, and Rollo said he
believed he should never again want to have any thing to do with
bad boys.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
