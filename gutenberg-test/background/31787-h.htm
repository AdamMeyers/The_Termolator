<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<p>"<span class="smcap">The Bird and Insects' Post-Office</span>" was projected and written by <span class="smcap">Robert
Bloomfield</span>, author of the "Farmer's Boy," &amp;c., excepting Letters VIII.,
X., XI., and XVI. by his eldest son, Charles. It was the author's
intention to publish it uniformly with his other juvenile work, the
"<span class="smcap">History of Little Davy's New Hat</span>," but he did not live to do so, and it
was therefore included in his literary <i>Remains</i>, published in 1824&mdash;a
year after the poet's death&mdash;in two volumes, price twelve shillings. Its
circulation, in consequence, has been extremely limited, its form of
publication preventing its introduction to children; for this reason,
and because I think it would be a pity for it to be shut up for ever in
a dusty old volume from<a name="page_9" id="page_9"></a> the little ones, for whom it was written, I
have sent it forth in the form originally intended for it to assume.</p>

<p>The original manuscript, in the author's autograph, I recently presented
to the Trustees of the British Museum.</p>

<h3>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h3>
<p>W<span class="smcap">e</span> all know that Æsop has made his birds and beasts talk, and reason
too; and that so well as still to make the volume bearing his name a
favourite with thousands. Perhaps, too, we all know that same French
author has objected to this method of teaching, alleging that children
should not be imposed upon (or something to that effect), and led to
believe in the <i>reality</i> of talking birds and beasts. To me it appears
plainly that they do not, nor are they inclined to, believe in any such
reality. Observe two or three children at play with a favourite kitten.
When one of them, in mere wantonness, shall give the little animal a rap
on the nose, or a squeeze by the tail, the owner of the cat will
instantly exclaim, "Poor little pussy! she does not like that, <i>she
says</i>." Now, the child knows very well that the cat did not say a word
about the matter, but she looked and acted as if she had, and that was
enough.<a name="page_15" id="page_15"></a></p>

<p><a name="page_14" id="page_14"></a>In the following pages I have endeavoured to make my winged and creeping
correspondents talk in their own characters, according to their
well-known habits and pursuits.</p>

<p>I have added a few notes, sometimes of illustration, and sometimes of
inquiry; for, as natural history is almost a boundless field, I may
stand in need of correction myself. It will be obvious that I have taken
only some of the plainest and simplest subjects, for the purpose of
trying whether any interest can be awakened in young minds by such
means. And as I like to write for children, and think a great deal of
information might be blended with amusement in this way, I hold myself
acquitted of the charge of trifling and puerility, and am the young
reader's friend and well-wisher,</p>

<p class="head"><i>FROM THE MAGPIE TO THE SPARROW.</i></p>
<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Little Jabberer</span>,</p>

<p>I have many times thought of addressing to you a few words of advice, as
you seem to stand in need of such a friend.<a name="page_20" id="page_20"></a></p>

<p>You know that I do not stand much upon ceremony; I am always ready for
talking and for giving advice, and really wonder how other birds can
keep themselves so quiet. Then you will pardon my frankness, since you
know my character, when I inform you that I think you remarkably tame
and spiritless: you have no enterprise in you. In an old farmyard,
shuffling amongst the straw, there you may be found morning, noon and
night; and you are never seen in the woods and groves with me and my
companions, where we have the blessing of free liberty, and fly where we
please. You must often have heard me sing; that cannot be doubted,
because I am heard a great way. As to me, I never come down to your
farm, unless I think I can find a hen's egg or two amongst the nettles,
or a chicken or duck just hatched.</p>

<p>I earnestly advise you to change your manner of life and take a little
free air, as I do. Stop no longer in your dull yard, feeding upon pigs'
leavings, but come abroad with me. But I must have done till a better
opportunity; for the gamekeeper with his gun has just<a name="page_21" id="page_21"></a> turned the
corner. Take my advice, and you may be as well off, and learn to sing as
well as I do.</p>

<p>I was hopping along the top ridge of the house when I received your
insolent and conceited epistle,<a name="page_25" id="page_25"></a><a name="page_24" id="page_24"></a><a name="page_23" id="page_23"></a> which does you no credit, but is very
much in your usual style. "Little Jabberer" indeed! and pray, what is
your letter of advice? Nothing but jabber from beginning to end. You
<i>sing</i>, you say. I have heard you often enough; but if yours is singing,
then I must be allowed to be no judge of the matter. You say you are
afraid of the gamekeeper; this, perhaps, allows some sense in you, for
he is paid for killing all kinds of vermin.</p>

<p>And so you come down to our farm when you think you can steal something!
Thus, if I did not hide my eggs and my young ones, in a hole too small
for you to enter, I can see pretty plainly how I should come off with
your thieving and your advice.</p>

<p>Be advised in <i>your</i> turn; keep away from our yard, for my master has a
gun too; and your chattering, which I suppose you call singing, he
abominably hates. You will be in danger of catching what the gamekeeper
threatens, and then where is the great difference between your station
and mine?<a name="page_26" id="page_26"></a></p>

<p class="head"><i>FROM A YOUNG GARDEN-SPIDER TO HER MOTHER.</i></p>
<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,</p>

<p>I cannot exactly tell what happened before I came out of the shell; but,
from circumstances, I can give you some information. When I came to
life, amongst some scores of other little merry yellow creatures, I
found myself, and all of us, enclosed in a thing, through which we, with
our eight eyes, could see very well, but could not instantly get out. I
soon perceived that we, in the egg state, wrapped in a white bag, as you
left us, had been put into a thing called a bottle, by one of those
great creatures whom we always call <i>striders</i>; but this was a
particular one of that tribe, who wanted to play tricks with us&mdash;one
whom they would perhaps call a philosopher.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><a name="page_30" id="page_30"></a> Well, his own sense (if
he had any) told him that we could not live without air; so he left the
cork out, and went about his business; no doubt of much less consequence
than the lives of all us prisoners&mdash;but that they do not mind. But how
long were we prisoners? Why, as soon as ever we were out of the shell we
began to spin, and linked our webs so thick together that the
philosopher's bottle would hold us no longer. We climbed out in a crowd,
and spread our webs over the room, up to the very ceiling. I shall never
forget how the great booby stared when he saw us all climbing up our own
rope-ladders! I wonder if those great creatures are not sometimes caught
in webs spun by their fellow-creatures, and whether they are not
sometimes put by hundreds into a bottle without possessing any means of
escape? But I am but a child, and must live and learn before I talk more
freely. Long life to you, dear mother, and plenty of flies.</p>

<p class="head"><i>FROM A YOUNG NIGHTINGALE TO A WREN.</i></p>
<p class="sign sml">Dated "Home Wood."</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Neighbour</span>,</p>

<p>When we last met you seemed very lively and agreeable, but you asked an
abundance of questions, and particularly wanted to know whether we
nightingales really do, as is said of us, cross the great water every
year, and return in the spring to sing in your English groves. Now, as I
am but young, I must be modest, and not prate about what I cannot as yet
understand. I must say, nevertheless, that I never heard my parents talk
of any particular long journey which they had performed to reach this
country, or that they should return, and take me and the rest of the
family with them, at this particular time or season. I know this, that I
never saw my parents fly further at one flight than from one side of a
field to another or from one grove to the next. Who are<a name="page_34" id="page_34"></a> they who call
us "birds of passage"?<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They certainly may know more of the extent of
the <span class="smcap">Great Waters</span> than we can, neighbour Wren; but have they considered
our powers, and the probability of what they assert? I am sure, if my
parents should call on me to go with them, I shall be flurried out of my
life. But it is my business to obey. I have so lately got my feathers,
that I cannot be<a name="page_37" id="page_37"></a><a name="page_36" id="page_36"></a><a name="page_35" id="page_35"></a> a proper judge of the matter. As to the swallows and
many other birds going to a vast distance, there is no wonder in that,
if you look at their wings; but how would you, for instance, perform
such a journey&mdash;you who, even when you sing, put yourself into a violent
passion, as if you had not a minute to live? We nightingales are the<a name="page_38" id="page_38"></a>
birds for song. This you will acknowledge, I dare say, though I have not
begun yet. I will give you a specimen when I come back (if I am really
to go), and you will hear me in "<i>Home Wood</i>" when it is dark, and you
have crept into your little nest in the hovel.</p>

<h3><a name="LETTER_V" id="LETTER_V"></a>LETTER V.</h3>

<p class="head"><i>FROM AN EARWIG, DEPLORING THE LOSS OF ALL HER CHILDREN.</i></p>
<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt</span>,</p>

<p>You cannot think how distressed I have been, and still am; for, under
the bark of a large elm, which, I dare say, has stood there a great
while, I had placed my whole family, where they were dry, comfortable,
and, as I foolishly thought, secure. But only mark what calamities may
fall upon earwigs before they are aware of them! I had just got my
family about me, all white, clean, and promising children, when pounce
came down that bird they call a woodpecker; when, thrusting his huge
beak under the bark where we lay, down went our whole sheltering roof!
and my children, poor things, running,<a name="page_40" id="page_40"></a> as they thought, from danger,
were devoured as fast as the destroyer could open his beak and shut it.
For my own part, I crept into a crack in the solid tree, where I have
thus far escaped; but as this bird can make large holes into solid
timber, I am by no means safe.</p>

<p>This calamity is the more heavy, as it carries with it a great
disappointment; for very near our habitation was a high wall, the sunny
side of which was covered with the most delicious fruits&mdash;peaches,
apricots, nectarines, &amp;c.&mdash;all just then ripening; and I thought of
having such a feast with my children as I had never enjoyed in my life.</p>

<p>I am surrounded by woodpeckers, jackdaws, magpies, and other devouring
creatures, and think myself very unfortunate. Yet, perhaps, if I could
know the situation of some larger creatures&mdash;I mean particularly such as
would tread me to death if I crossed their path&mdash;they may have
complaints to make as well as I.</p>

<p>Take care of yourself, my good old aunt, and I shall keep in my
hiding-place as long as starvation will<a name="page_41" id="page_41"></a> permit, And, after all, perhaps
the fruit was not so delicious as it looked&mdash;I am resolved to think so,
just to comfort myself.</p>

<p class="head"><i>FROM THE WILD DUCK TO THE TAME DUCK.</i></p>
<p class="sign sml">Dated Lincoln and Ely Fens.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p>I suppose I must call you so, though I declare I know not how we are
related. But, though I am thought so very wild and shy, I have still a
kind of fellow-feeling for you; and, if you have not gone to the spit
before this comes to you, I should be glad of your reply in a friendly
way. You know very well that you are intended to be eaten, and so are
we&mdash;when they can catch us. I understand that you never fly and that you
seldom waddle above a meadow's length from your pond, where you keep
puddling and groping from daylight till dark. This, I assure you, is not
the life that I lead. We fly together in vast numbers in the night, for
many miles over this flat, wet country; so, as to water, we have an
inexhaustible store: we may swim ourselves tired. But, I dare say, every
station of our duck-lives is subject to some disadvantages and some
calamities. Thus, with all our wildness, we are not secure; for we are
taken<a name="page_43" id="page_43"></a>
sometimes by hundreds in a kind of trap which is called a
decoy.</p>

<p>Some of our tribe have been made tame like you (but I hope you are not
so false-hearted), and then their masters feed them plentifully, in a
place contrived on purpose, with a narrow entrance, with which these
<i>traitor ducks</i> are well acquainted, so that they can pass in and out at
a place we strangers should never have thought of. They are sent out in
the dusk of the evening, when they soon join with large companies of us
strangers; and knowing, as they do, their way home, and that they shall
find food, they set off, close at each other's tails, along a ditch, or
watercourse, and we fools follow them.</p>

<p>The entrance, as far as I could see of it, is very narrow; for I have
been twice within a hair's breadth of being caught, and do not pretend
to know all about it; but I wish heartily that every duck and drake in
the country&mdash;ay, and every one of our allies, the geese, too, could say
as much&mdash;could say that "they had twice been on the verge of destruction
by keeping bad company, but had escaped."</p>

<p>What becomes of my companions, when taken, I think<a name="page_46" id="page_46"></a> I have heard pretty
accurately; for there is somewhere a very large assemblage of
fellow-creatures to those who catch us, and whose demand seems never to
be satisfied. Well, never mind, cousin; I am determined to fly, and swim
too, as long as I can, and I advise you to do the same, and make the
most of your day.</p>

<p>Hoping to hear from you, I am, affectionately, your wild cousin.</p>

<p class="head"><i>THE TAME DUCK'S REPLY.</i></p>
<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Cousin Wilding</span>,</p>

<p>I confess I did not at all expect to hear from you; for I always
believed you to be one of those thoughtless<a name="page_48" id="page_48"></a> young creatures which are
to be found in other stations of life as well as in yours and mine, who,
as soon as they get fledged and able to get abroad, care no more for
their parents and those who brought them up than I care for a shower of
rain. However, you have escaped danger <i>twice</i>, and you have reason to
congratulate yourself. I have been sitting here upon ten eggs for three
weeks past, and of course have another week to be confined; but then the
thoughts of the pleasure I shall have in hatching and guiding my young
ones to the water, is ample payment for all my pains. They will look so
clean and so delighted, and will do as they are bid by the smallest
quack that I can utter, that I must be a bad mother indeed if I am not
proud of them. Perhaps you will wonder when I tell you that we have a
creature here&mdash;fledged indeed&mdash;which is called a hen; a strange,
cackling, flying, useless, noisy, silly creature, which is as much
afraid of water as you are of your decoy.</p>

<p class="nind">I have often known one of
these birds to hatch nine or ten of my eggs; and then, if you wanted to
ridicule the lifted foot of conceit, and the dignity of<a name="page_51" id="page_51"></a> assumed
importance, you should see her lead her young, or more properly, see the
young lead her to the nearest water they can find. In they go, and she
begins to call and scold, and run round the edge to save them from
drowning! Now, what fools these hens must be compared to us ducks! at
least, I, for one, am determined to think so. I have seen this same hen
with the brood about her scratching in our farmyard with all her might;
when, not considering who was behind her, or who under her feathers, she
has tricked away one little yellow duck with one of her claws, and
another with the other, till I wished I had her in a pond; I would have
given her a good sousing, depend upon it. But really, cousin, don't you
think that this way of contradicting our natures and propensities is
very wrong? Suppose, for instance, I should sit upon a dozen of that
silly creature's eggs which I mentioned above&mdash;for I will never consent
to have them matched with us&mdash;I should then, to be sure, have a week's
holiday, as they sit but three weeks; but what should I bring to light?
a parcel of little, useless, tip-toed, cowardly things, that would not
follow me into the pond&mdash;<a name="page_52" id="page_52"></a>I cannot bear to think of it. I have written
you a long letter, and can think of no more but Quack! quack! quack! and
farewell.</p>

<p class="head">(<span class="smcap">Charles Bloomfield.</span>)</p>
<p class="poem">
Excuse, Mr. Bee, this epistle, to one<br />
Whose time, from the earliest gleam of the sun<br />
Till he sinks in the west, is so busily spent,<br />
That I fear I intrude;&mdash;but I write with intent<br />
To save your whole city from pillage and ruin,<br />
And to warn you in time of a plot that is brewing.<a name="page_67" id="page_67"></a><br />
Last night, when, as usual, enjoying the hour<br />
When the gloaming had spread, and a trickling shower<br />
Was beading the grass as it silently fell,<br />
And day with reluctance was bidding farewell;<br />
When down by yon hedge, nearly opposite you,<br />
And your City of Honey, as proudly I threw<br />
The rays from my lamp in a magical round;<br />
I listened, alarmed upon hearing the sound<br />
Of human intruders approaching more near;<br />
But I presently found <i>I</i> had nothing to fear,<br />
For the hedge was between us, and I and my gleam<br />
Lay hid from their view: when the following scheme<br />
I heard, as they sheltered beneath the old tree,<br />
And send you each creature's own words, Mr. Bee:&mdash;<br />
"See, Jack, there it is; now suppose you and I,<br />
With a spade and some brimstone, should each of us try<br />
Some night, when we're sure all the bees are at rest,<br />
To smother them all, and then dig out the nest."<br />
"I know we can do it," said Jack with delight;<br />
"I can't come to-morrow; but s'pose the next night<br />
We both set about it, if you are inclined;<a name="page_68" id="page_68"></a><br />
And then we will halve all the honey we find?"<br />
"Agreed," said the other, "but let us be gone."<br />
And they left me in thought until early this morn;<br />
When I certainly meant, if your worship had stay'd<br />
But a minute or two, till my speech I had made,<br />
To have saved you the reading, as well as the cost<br />
Of a letter by post&mdash;but my words were all lost;<br />
For though they were lavished each time you came near,<br />
Or was close overhead, and I thought you <i>should</i> hear,<br />
Yet the buzz of importance, as onward you flew,<br />
Bobbing into each flower the whole meadow through,<br />
So baffled your brains that I let you alone,<br />
For I found that I might as well speak to a drone:<br />
Yet, rather than quietly leave you to fate<br />
(Such a villainous thought never entered my pate),<br />
I send you this letter, composed by the light<br />
Of my silvery lamp in the dead of the night,<br />
And about the same time, and the very same place,<br />
That a few nights ago, when the moon hid her face,<br />
I beheld, nearly hid in the grass as I lay,<br />
And my lamp in full splendour reflecting its ray<a name="page_69" id="page_69"></a><br />
In the eye of each dewdrop, the fairies unseen<br />
To all human vision, trip here with their Queen,<br />
To pay me a visit, to dance and to feast;<br />
And their revels continued, till full in the east<br />
The sun tinged the clouds for another bright day,<br />
When each took the warning and bounded away:<br />
'Tis the same at this moment. Farewell, Mr. Hum,<br />
I've extinguished my lamp, for the morning is come.<br />

<p>You will think me very idle, or very unfeeling, if I delay answering you
any longer; I will therefore tell you some of my own troubles, to
convince you that I have had causes of delay, which you can have no
notion of until I explain them. You must know, then, that we are subject
to more than the random gun-shot in the field, for we are sometimes
taken out of our house a hundred at a time, and put into a large
basket<a name="page_73" id="page_73"></a>
to be placed in a meadow or spare plat of ground suiting the
purpose, there to be murdered at leisure. This they call "shooting from
the trap,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and is done in this way:</p>

<p>We being imprisoned, as I have said, as thick as we can stand in the
basket, a man is placed by us to take us out <i>singly</i>, and carry us to a
small box, at the distance of fifty or sixty yards; this box has a lid,
to which is attached a string, by means of which, he, the man (if he is
a man) can draw up the lid and let us fly at a signal given. Every
sensible pigeon of course flies for his life, for, ranged on each side,
stand from two to four or six men with guns, who fire as the bird gets
upon the wing; and the cleverest fellows are those who can kill
most;&mdash;and this they call <i>sport</i>!<a name="page_74" id="page_74"></a></p>

<p>I have sad cause to know how this sport is conducted, for I have been in
the trap myself. Only one man, or perhaps a boy, fired at me as I rose;
but I received two wounds, for one shot passed through my crop, but I
was astonished to find how soon it got well; the other broke my leg just
below the feathers. Oh, what anguish I suffered for two months! at the
end of which time it withered and dropped off. So now, instead of
running about amongst my red-legged brethren, as a pigeon ought, I am
obliged to hop like a sparrow. But only consider what glory this
stripling must have acquired, to have actually fired a gun and broke a
pigeon's leg! Well, we both know, neighbour Partridge, what the Hawk is;
he stands for no law, nor no season, but eats us when he is hungry. He
is a perfect gentleman compared to these "Lords of the Creation," as I
am told they call themselves; and I declare to you upon the honour of a
pigeon, that I had much rather be torn to pieces by the Hawk than be
shut up in a box at a convenient distance to be shot at by a dastard.

<p>I am sorry for your trouble, but cheer up your spirits, and though you
are insulted, remember who it is that gives the affront, it is only the
magpie; and depend upon it that in general the best way to deal with
impudent fools is to be silent and take no notice of them. I should have
enough to do if I were to resent all her impertinences. She will come
sometimes round the ivy where I lodge in the old elm, or into the tower
on the top of the hill; and there she will pimp and pry into my private
concerns, and mob me, and call me "Old Wigsby" and "Doctor Winkum," and
such kind of names, and all for nothing. I assure you it is well for her
that she is not a mouse, or she<a name="page_86" id="page_86"></a> should not long escape my talons; but
who ever heard of such a thing as eating a magpie? I live chiefly on
mice (when I am at liberty to catch them), but I have my complaints to
make as well as you, for you know I hold a high situation in the
Post-office, and I suppose you know, likewise, that the letters are
brought in so very late that it often takes me half the night to sort
them, and night is the very time when I ought to get my own food! At
this rate of going on, and if the cats are industrious as usual, there
will not be a mouse left for me, if I do not give up my place.</p>

<p>I have heard that my family are famed for wisdom; but for my part I will
not boast of any such thing: yet I am wise enough to know that other
people in high offices expect either a good salary or perquisites, as a
reward for their labour, or what is easier still, somebody to do all the
work for them. If I hold in my present mind until next quarter, I will
certainly send in my resignation. Thus you see what an important thing
it is to suit the person to the office, or the office to the person on
whom it is conferred; for had the magpie, for instance,<a name="page_87" id="page_87"></a> been secretary,
every one of the letters would have been peeped into, for a certainty,
for nothing can escape her curiosity. I will try to bear with my
situation a little longer, and believe me to be</p>

<p>I remember your peaceful singing on the top of your shed, near my late
dwelling, and I remember
also that I promised to write you some
account of my journey. You may recollect that, at the close of your
summer, when flies became scarce, we all assembled on a sunny morning,
on the roof of the highest building in the village, and talked loudly of
the flight we intended to take. At last came the day appointed, and we
mounted up in a vast body and steered southward.</p>

<p>Being hatched in England, I had thought your valleys and streams
matchless in beauty; and for anything I know to the contrary they
certainly are; but I am now a traveller, and have a traveller's
privilege to say what I like. When we reached the great water I was
astonished at its width, but more still to see many travelling houses
going at a prodigious rate, and sending forth from iron chimneys columns
of black smoke over the face of the water, reaching further than you
ever flew in your life; they have a contrivance on each side which puts
the waves all in commotion, but they are not wings. My mother says that
in old times, when swallows came to England, there were no such things
to be seen. We crossed this water, and a fine sunny country beyond it,
until I was tired, and we

<p class="head">(<span class="smcap">Charles Bloomfield.</span>)</p>
<p class="poem">
'Twas the blush of the spring, vegetation was young,<br />
And the birds with a maddening ecstasy sung<br />
To welcome a season so lovely and gay&mdash;<br />
But a scene the most sweet was the close of May-day.<a name="page_96" id="page_96"></a><br />
For the air was serene, and the moon was out bright,<br />
And Philomel boldly exerted her might<br />
In her swellings and trillings, to rival the sound<br />
Of the distant defiance of nightingales round.<br />
While the cuckoo as proudly was heard to prolong,<br />
Though daylight was over, her own mellow song,<br />
And appeared to exult; and at intervals, too,<br />
The owl in the distance joined in with "Too-whoo!"<br />
Unceasing, unwearied, each, proud of his power,<br />
Continued the contest from hour to hour;<br />
The nightingale vaunting&mdash;the owl in reply&mdash;<br />
With the cuckoo's response&mdash;till the moon from the sky<br />
Was hastening down to the west, and the dawn<br />
Was spreading the east; and the owl in the morn<br />
Sat silently winking his eyes at the sight;<br />
And the nightingale also had bidden "good-night."<br />
The cuckoo, left solus, continued with glee,<br />
His notes of defeat from his favourite tree;<br />
At length he departed; but still as he flew,<br />
Was heard his last notes of defiance, "Cuckoo!"<br />

"You talk of primroses that you pulled on Candlemas Day, but what think

if was at all an omen, it could not be an unfavourable one. The winter,
however, is now making himself amends, and seems the more peevish for

and outhouses of the village. I was utterly disgusted, and it required a
strong effort of the mind to avoid wishing that one of the gunners at
least had hobbled off the ground with a dangling leg, which might for

well-known quarrel between the two families about building their nests.
The magpie once undertook to teach the pigeon how to build a more
substantial and commodious dwelling, and certainly it would have become
the learner to have observed her progress, and not interrupt the
teacher; but the pigeon kept on her usual cry, "Take two, Taffy, take
two" (for thus it is translated in Suffolk), but Mag insisted this was
wrong, and that one stick at a time was quite enough; still the pigeon
kept on her cry, "Take two, take two," until the teacher in a violent
passion gave up the undertaking, exclaiming, "I say that one at a time
is plenty, and if you think otherwise, you may act about the work
yourself, for I will have no more to do with it." Since that time the
wood-pigeon has built a wretched nest, sure enough, so thin that you may
frequently see her two eggs through it, and if not placed near the body
of a tree, or on strong branches, it is often thrown down by the wind,
or the eggs rolled out; yet the young of this bird, before they are half
grown, will defend themselves against any intruder, at which time the
parent bird will dash herself down amongst the standing corn or high
grass, and behave as though her wings were broken, and she was utterly
disabled; and this she does to draw off the enemy from her young; so
that this bird is not so foolish as Mag would make us believe.&mdash;R. B.</p></div>

some information on a very curious subject, for I would rather believe
the swallow himself than many tales told of them. It has been said that,
instead of flying to southern countries, where they can find food and a
congenial climate, they dive into the waters of a bog, and lie in a
torpid state, through the winter, round the roots of flags and
weeds.&mdash;R. B.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
