            TRANSLATOR'S NOTE
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="+1">T</font>HE name of Father Valuy, S.J.,
            is already favourably known to English readers by
            several translations of his works, which have a large
            circulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following little treatise is taken from one of his
            works on the Religious Life, and is translated with the
            kind permission of the publisher, M. Emmanuel Vitte, of
            Lyons. The subject is so important a factor in
            community life that I feel confident it will supply a
            want hitherto felt by many.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though specially written for religious, it cannot fail
            to prove beneficial to seculars in every sphere of
            life, as love, the sunshine of existence, is wanted
            everywhere.

            precept and example that His favourite virtue, His own
            and, in a certain sense, characteristic virtue, was
            charity. Whether He treated with His ignorant and rude
            Apostles, with the sick and poor, or with His enemies
            and sinners, He is always benign, condescending,
            merciful, affable, patient; in a word, His charity
            appeared in all its most amiable forms. Oh, how well
            these titles suit Him!&mdash;a King full of clemency, a
            Lamb full of mildness. How justly could He say, "Learn
            of Me, that I am meek and humble of heart"! His yoke
            was sweet, His burden light, His conversation without
            sadness or bitterness. He lightened the burdens of
            those heavily laden; He consoled those in sorrow; He
            quenched not the dying spark nor broke the bruised
            reed.

        <p>
            He calls us His friends, His brothers, His little
            flock; and as the greatest sign of friendship is to die
            for those we love, He gave to each of us the right to
            say with St. Paul: "He loved me, and delivered Himself
            up for me." Let us, then, say: "My good Master, I love
            Thee, and deliver myself up for Thee."

            Religious, called to reproduce the three great virtues
            of Jesus Christ&mdash;poverty, chastity, and
            obedience&mdash;have still another to practise not less
            noble or distinctive&mdash;viz., fraternal charity. By
            this virtue they are not called to rise above earthly
            or sensual pleasures, nor above their judgment and
            self-will, but above egotism and self-love, which shoot
            their roots deepest in the soul. They must consider
            attentively the fundamental truths on which charity is
            based and its effects, as also the principal obstacles
            to its attainment, and the means to overcome them.

        <p>
            <font size="+1">C</font>HARITY towards our neighbour is
            charity towards God in our neighbour, because, faith
            assuring us that God is our Father, Jesus Christ our
            Head, the Holy Ghost our sanctifier, it follows that to
            love our neighbour&mdash;inasmuch as he is the
            well-beloved child of God, the member of Jesus Christ,
            and the sanctuary of the Holy Ghost&mdash;is to love in
            a special manner our heavenly Father, His only-begotten
            Son, together with the Holy Spirit. And because it is
            scarcely possible for religious to behold their
            brethren in this light without wishing them what the
            Most Holy Trinity so lovingly desires to bestow on
            them, acts of fraternal charity include&mdash;almost
            necessarily at least&mdash;implicit acts of faith and
            hope; and the exercise of the noblest of the
            theological virtues thus often becomes an exercise of
            the other two.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus it is that charity poured into our hearts by the
            Holy Spirit, uniting Christians among themselves and
            with the adorable Trinity whose images they are, is the
            vivid and perfect imitation of the love of the Father
            for the Son, and of the Son for the Father&mdash;a
            substantial love which is no other than the Holy Ghost,
            and makes us all one in God by grace, as the Father and
            Son are only one God with the Holy Ghost by nature,
            according to the words of our Lord: "That they all may
            be one; as Thou, Father, in Me, and I in Thee: that
            they also may be one in Us."
        </p>
        <p>
            Such is the chain that unites and binds us&mdash;a
            chain of gold a thousand times stronger than those of
            flesh and blood, interest or friendship, because these
            permit the defects of body and the vices of the soul to
            be seen, whilst charity covers all, hides all, to offer
            exclusively to admiration and love the work of the
            hands of God, the price of the blood of Jesus Christ
            and the masterpiece of the Holy Spirit.

        <p>
            <font size="+1">T</font>O love our brethren as
            ourselves in relation to God, it suffices without doubt
            to have with them the same faith, the same Sacraments,
            the same head, the same life, the same immortal hopes,
            etc. But, besides these, there exist other
            considerations which lead friendship and fraternity to
            a higher degree among the members of the same religious
            Order. All in the novitiate have been cast in the same
            mould, or, rather, have imbibed the milk of knowledge
            and piety from the breasts of the same mother. All
            follow the same rules; all tend to the same end by the
            same means; all from morning to night, and during their
            whole lives, perform the same exercises, live under the
            same roof, work, sanctify themselves, suffer and
            rejoice together. Like fellow-citizens, they have the
            same interests; like soldiers, the same combats; like
            children of a family, the same ancestors and heirlooms;
            and, like friends, a communication of ideas and
            interchange of sentiments.
        </p>
        <p>
            If our Lord said to Christians in general, "This is My
            commandment, that you love one another as I have loved
            you. By this shall all men know that you are My
            disciples, if you have love for one another" (John
            xiii.), can He not say to the members of the same
            religious Order: "This is My own and special
            recommendation: Before all and above all preserve
            amongst you a mutual charity. Have but one soul in
            several different bodies. You will be recognized as
            religious and brethren, not by the same habit, vows,
            and virtues, nor by the particular work entrusted to
            you by the Church, but by the love you have one for the
            other. Ah! who will love you if you do not love one
            another? Love one another fraternally, because as human
            beings you have only one heavenly Father. Love one
            another holily, because as Christians you have only one
            Head. Love one another tenderly, because as religious
            you have only one mother&mdash;your Order"?
        </p>
        <p>
            It is impossible for religious to love their brethren
            with a true, sincere, pure, and constant love if they
            do not look at them in this light.

            THE FAMILY SPIRIT

        <p>
            <font size="+1">B</font>ASED on the foregoing
            principles, fraternal charity begets the family
            spirit&mdash;that spirit which forgets itself in
            thinking only of the common good; which makes
            particular give way to general interests; which forces
            oneself to live with all without exception, to live as
            all without singularity, and to live for all without
            self-seeking; that spirit which, binding like a Divine
            cement all parts of the mysterious edifice of religion,
            uniting all hearts in one and all wills in one, permits
            the community to proceed firmly and securely, and its
            members to work out efficaciously and peacefully their
            personal sanctification and perfection; in fine, that
            spirit which gives to all religious not only an
            inexpressible family happiness, but a delicious
            foretaste of heaven, which renders them invincible to
            their enemies, and causes to be said of them with
            admiration: "See how they love one another!"
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing on these words of the Psalmist, "Behold how
            good and pleasant it is for brethren to live together
            in union," St. Augustine cries out: "Behold the words
            which make monasteries spring up! Sweet, delightful,
            and delicious words which fill the soul and ear with
            jubilation."
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, certainly the happiness of community life is great
            and its advantages inappreciable; but without the
            family spirit there is no community, as there would be
            no beauty in the human body without harmony in its
            members. Oh, never forget this comparison, you who wish
            to live happy in religion, and who wish to make others
            happy.
        </p>
        <p>
            A community is a body. Now, as the members of a body,
            each in its proper place and functions, live in perfect
            harmony, mutually comfort, defend, and love each other,
            without being jealous or vengeful, and have only in
            view the well-being of that body of which they are
            parts, so in the community of which you are members and
            in the employment assigned to you. Remember you are
            parts of a whole, and that it is necessary to refer to
            this whole your time, labour, and strength; to have the
            same thoughts, sentiments, designs, and language,
            without which there would no longer exist either body,
            members, parts, or whole. If you wish, then, to obtain
            and practise the family spirit, study what passes
            within you. Your actions bespeak your sentiments.

            makes them concentrated in self, places them in the
            community, but not of it, makes them strangers amongst
            their brethren, and tends to justify the words of an
            impious writer, who calls monasteries "reunions of
            persons who know not each other, who live without love,
            and die without being regretted."

            Egotism breeds distrust, jealousy, parties, aversions.
            It destroys abnegation, humility, patience, and all
            other virtues. It introduces a universal disgust and
            discontent, makes religious lose their first fervour,
            presents an image of hell where one expected to find a
            heaven on earth, saps the very foundation of community
            life, and leads sooner or later to inevitable ruin.

            As the family spirit causes the growth and prosperity
            of an order, however feeble its beginning, so, on the
            other hand, egotism dries the sap and renders it
            powerless, no matter what other advantages it may
            enjoy. If the one, by uniting hearts, is a principle of
            strength and duration, the other, by dividing, is a
            principle of dissolution and decay. Sallust says that
            "the weakest things become powerful by concord, and the
            greatest perish through discord." Whilst the
            descendants of Noah spoke the same language the
            building of the tower of Babel proceeded with rapidity.
            From the moment they ceased to understand one another
            its destruction commenced, and the monument which was
            to have immortalized their name was left in ruin to
            tell their shame and pride.

            On each of the four corners of the monastery religion
            or charity personified ought to be placed, bearing on
            shields in large characters the following words: (1)
            "Love one another"; (2) "He who is not with Me is
            against Me, and he who gathers not with Me scatters";
            (3) "Every kingdom divided will become desolate"; (4)

            cannot live with pride, the disease of a soul full of
            itself. It willingly prefers others by considering
            their good qualities and one's own defects, and shows
            this exteriorly when occasion offers by many sincere
            proofs. It always looks on others from the most
            favourable point. Instead of closing the eyes on fifty
            virtues to find out one fault, without any other profit
            than to satisfy a natural perverseness and to excuse
            one's own failings, it closes the eyes on fifty faults
            to open them on one virtue, with the double advantage
            of being edified and of blessing God, the Author of all
            good. Since an unfavourable thought, or the sight of an
            action apparently reprehensible, tends to cloud the
            reputation of a religious, charity hastens before the
            cloud thickens to drive it away, saying, "What am I
            doing? Should I blacken in my mind the image of God,
            and seek deformities in the member of Jesus Christ?
            Besides, cannot my brethren be eminently holy and be
            subject to many faults, which God permits them to fall
            into in order to keep them humble, to teach them to
            help others, and to exercise their patience?"

            into consideration the different circumstances of age,
            employment, merit, character, birth, and education to
            make itself all to all. Convinced that God is not

            that religious ought not to respect themselves less
            than people in the world, it conforms to all the

            ruminating in their hearts, and who consider every
            little insult as levelled at themselves; nor
            discontented beings, who find fault with the places
            whither obedience sends them and the persons with whom

            condescending, accommodating, yielding, self-denying,

            question, renders service even when the need is only
            imaginary, without ever betraying the least signs of
            annoyance. It never asks for exceptions or privileges
            for fear of exciting jealousy. It does not multiply nor
            prolong conversations which in any way annoy others. It
            fights antipathy and natural aversions so that they may
            never appear, and seeks even the company of those who
            might be the object of them. It does not assume the
            office of reprehending or warning through a motive of
            bitter zeal. It seeks to find in oneself the faults it
            notices in others, and perhaps greater ones, and tries
            to correct them. "If thou canst not make thyself such a
            one as thou wouldst, how canst thou expect to have
            another according to thy liking? We would willingly
            have others perfect, and yet we mend not our own
            defects. We would have others strictly corrected, but
            are not fond of being corrected ourselves. The large
            liberty of others displeases us, and yet we do not wish
            to be denied anything we ask for. We are willing that
            others be bound up by laws, and we suffer not ourselves
            to be restrained by any means. Thus it is evident how
            seldom we weigh our neighbour in the same balance with
            ourselves" ("Imitation," i. 16).

            opportunity of comforting, helping, and taking the most
            painful part, after the example of its Divine Model,
            Who came to serve, not to be served. One religious,

            comes to the aid by consoling the one, procuring little
            gratifications for the other, and helping another.
            Without complaining of the increased labour or the
            carelessness of others, it finishes the work left
            undone by them, too happy to diminish their trouble,
            while augmenting its own reward. "Does the hunter,"
            says St. John Chrysostom, "who finds splendid game
            blame those who beat the brushwood before him? Or does
            the traveller who finds a purse of gold on the road

            took no notice of it?" It would be a strange thing to
            find religious uselessly giving themselves to ardent
            desires of works of charity abroad, such as nursing in
            a hospital or carrying the Gospel into uncivilized
            lands, and at the same time in their own house and
            among their own brethren showing coldness,
            indifference, and want of condescension.

            There is an art of giving as well as of refusing.
            Several offend in giving because they do so with a bad
            grace; others in refusing do not offend because they
            know how to temper their refusal by sweetness of
            manner. Charity possesses this art in a high degree,
            and, besides, raises a mere worldly art into a virtue
            and fruit of the Holy Ghost.

            When David returned after he slew the Philistines, the
            women came out of all the cities of Israel singing and
            dancing to meet King Saul. And the women sang as they
            played, "Saul slew his thousands and David his ten
            thousands." Saul was exceedingly angry, and this word
            was displeasing in his eyes, and he said: "They have
            given David ten thousand, and to me they have given but
            a thousand. . . . And Saul did not look on David with a

            spear in his hand and threw it, thinking to nail David
            to the wall" (1 Kings). Thus it is that the jealous
            complain of their brethren who are more successful,
            learned, or praised; thus it is that they lance darts
            of calumny, denunciation, and revenge.

            for religious, as, not being able to seek comfort
            abroad, they are obliged to live in the same house,
            often in the same employment with characters less
            sympathetic than their own. These little acts of
            charity count for little here below, and they are
            rather exacted than admired. Hence there is less danger
            of vainglory, and all their merit is preserved in the
            sight of God.

            answers, lies, mockery, harsh words, etc., are all
            contrary to charity. St. John Chrysostom says: "When
            anyone loads you with injuries, close your mouth,
            because if you open it you will only cause a tempest.
            When in a room between two open doors through which a
            violent wind rushes and throws things in disorder, if
            you close one door the violence of the wind is checked
            and order is restored. So it is when you are attacked
            by anyone with a bad tongue. Your mouth and his are
            open doors. Close yours, and the storm ceases. If,
            unfortunately, you open yours, the storm will become
            furious, and no one can tell what the damage may be."
            If we have been guilty in this respect, let us humble
            ourselves before God.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The tongue," says St. Gertrude, "is privileged above
            the other members of the body, as on it reposes the
            sacred body and precious blood of Jesus Christ. Those,
            then, who receive the Holy of Holies without doing
            penance for the sins of the tongue are like those who
            would keep a heap of stones at their doors to stone a

            In order to keep ourselves and others in a state of

            fad, mania, or fixed ideas which they permit no one to
            gainsay. If we touch them on these points, it will be
            like playing an accompaniment to an instrument with one
            string out of tune.

            It requires that we visit those who are ill, to cheer

            to spare them the pain or humiliation of asking for
            anything.

            Charity pays honour to the aged in every respect,
            coincides with their sentiments, consults them,
            forestalls their desires, and attempts not to reform in

            fraternally all guests and new-comers, and makes us
            treat them as we would wish to be treated under similar
            circumstances. It also causes us to lavish testimonies
            of affection on those who are setting out, and warns us

            in the least degree offend even the most susceptible.

            Religious must ever feel that they can bless, love, and
            thank religion as a good mother. But religion is not an
            abstract matter; it is made up of individuals
            reciprocally bound together in and for each other.

            Alas! how many times are the sick and the old made to
            consider themselves as an inconvenient burden, or like
            a useless piece of furniture! In reality what are they
            doing? They pray and do penance for the community, turn
            away the scourge of God, draw down His graces and
            blessings, merit, perhaps, the grace of perseverance
            for several whose vocation is shaking, hand down to the
            younger members the traditions and spirit of the

            de Sales, "and the proof of it is that we speak so
            little of them. We try to change the discourse as if it
            were hurtful. We let the dead bury their dead. Their
            memory perishes with us like the sound of the funeral
            knell, without thinking that a friendship which
            perishes with death is not true. It is a sign of piety
            to speak of their virtues as it urges us to imitate
            them."
        </p>
        <p>
            In communities distinguished for fraternal charity and
            the family spirit the conversation frequently turns on
            the dead. One talks of their virtues, another of their
            services, a third quotes some of their sayings, while a
            fourth adds some other edifying fact; and who is the
            religious that will not on such occasions breathe a
            silent prayer to God and apply some indulgence or other
            satisfactory work for the happy repose of their souls?
        </p>
        <p>
            Charity also prays for those who want help most, and
            who are often known to God alone&mdash;those whose
            constancy is wavering, those who are led by violent
            temptations to the edge of the precipice. It expands
            pent-up souls by consolations or advice; it dissipates
            prejudices which tend to weaken the spirit of
            obedience; it is, in fine, a sort of instinct which
            embraces all those things suggested by zeal and
            devotion. Can there be anything more agreeable to God,
            more useful to the Church, or more meritorious, than to
            foster thus amongst the well-beloved children of God
            peace, joy, love of vocation, together with union
            amongst themselves and with their superiors? It is one
            of the most substantial advantages we have in religion
            to know that we are never forsaken in life or death; to
            find always a heart that can compassionate our pains, a
            hand which sustains us in danger and lifts us when we
            fall.

            of their limbs; if death deprived a father of his
            daughter, or a widow of an only son, Jesus was there to
            supply what was wanting, to give back what was lost, or
            to sweeten all their griefs. Sometimes He forestalled
            the petition by curing before being asked, or by
            exciting the wavering faith. He generally went beyond
            the demands of the petitioners. He was always ready to
            interrupt His meal, to go to a distance, or to quit His
            solitude. Nicodemus, as yet trembling and timid, came
            to find Jesus during the night, and He did not hesitate
            to sacrifice His sleep by prolonging the conversation.
            The Samaritan woman was not beneath His notice,
            although He was fatigued after a long journey. He
            lavished with prodigality His caresses on the children
            who pressed around Him. When the crowd was so great
            that the poor woman with the flow of blood could not
            come within reach of His hand, He caused an
            all-powerful virtue to set out from Him, and a simple
            touch of the hem of His garment supplied instead.

            making agreeable surprises? In His apparitions to
            Magdalen, to the holy women, to the disciples at
            Emmaus, did He not pay well for the ointment, the
            tears, and the perfumes, and the hospitality He
            received from them? Who is not moved with emotion when
            he sees his Lord preparing a meal for the Apostles on
            the lake-shore, or asking Peter thrice to give him an

            its fury, to force open the first door and break the
            first lock. "Melt your gold and silver, and make for

            uttering them&mdash;"and have for your mouth solid

            Considering these many barriers and formidable checks,
            must we not see the necessity of burying in a
            well-fortified prison that most dangerous monster, the
            tongue? "Ah! truly death and life are in the power of
            the tongue" (Prov. xviii.). "And although the sword has
            been the instrument of innumerable murders, the tongue
            has at all times beaten it in producing death" (Ecclus.
            xxviii.). "It forms but a small part of the body, and
            has done mighty evil: as the helm badly directed causes
            the wreck of a fine ship, and as a spark may enkindle a
            forest. . . . Unquiet evil, inflamed firebrand, source
            of deadly poison, world of iniquity" (St. James iii.).

            <font size="+1">S</font>T. BONAVENTURE relates that St.
            Francis of Assisi said to his religious one day:
            "Uncharitable conversation is worse than the assassin,
            because it kills souls and becomes intoxicated with
            their blood. It is worse than the mad dog, because it
            tears out and drags on all sides the living entrails of
            the neighbour. It is worse than the unclean animal,
            because it wallows in the filth of vices and makes its
            favourite pasture there. It is worse than Cham, because
            it exposes everywhere the nasty spots which soil the
            face of religion&mdash;its mother."
        </p>
        <p>
            St. Bernard goes further: "Do not hesitate to regard
            the tongue of the backbiter as more cruel than the iron
            of the lance which pierced our Saviour's side, because
            it not only pierces His sacred side, but one of His
            living members also, to whom by its wound it gives
            death. It is more cruel than the thorns with which His
            venerable head was crowned and torn, and even than the
            nails with which the wicked Jews fastened His sacred
            hands and feet to the Cross, because if our Divine
            Saviour did not esteem more highly the member of His
            mystic body (which is pierced by the foul tongue of the
            slanderer) than His own natural body formed by the
            operation of the Holy Ghost in the chaste womb of the
            Virgin Mary, He would never have consented to deliver
            the latter to ignominies and outrages to spare the
            former."
        </p>
        <p>
            Now St. Francis and St. Bernard are here speaking to
            religious. Is it possible, then, for backbiting to
            glide into religious communities? Yes, certainly. And
            it is by this snare that Satan catches souls which have
            escaped all others.
        </p>
        <p>
            St. Jerome says: "There are few who avoid this fault.
            Amongst those even who pride themselves on leading an
            irreproachable life, you will scarcely find any who do
            not criticize their brethren."
        </p>
        <p>
            Rarely, without doubt, but too often, nevertheless, we
            calumniate at first secretly or with one or two
            friends, afterwards openly and in public. We speak of
            the mistakes, shortcomings, and defects, great and
            small, and sometimes transmit them as a legacy.
            Sometimes we use a moderate hypocrisy by purposely
            letting ourselves be questioned, and sometimes brutally
            attack our victim without shame.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Have I, then," may the religious thus attacked say,
            "in making my vows renounced my honour and delivered my
            character to pillage? Has my position as religious, has
            the majesty of the King of Kings, of whom I have become
            the intimate friend, in place of ennobling me, degraded
            me? You call yourselves my brethren, and yet there are
            none who esteem me less! You would not steal my money,
            and yet you make no scruple of stealing my character, a
            thousand times more precious. You pay court to your
            Saviour and persecute His child! The same tongue on
            which reposes the Holy of Holies spreads poison and
            death! Is this to be the result of your study and
            practice of virtue? Has not Jesus Christ, by so many
            Communions, placed a little sweetness on your tongue
            and a little charity in your heart? By eating the Lamb
            have you become wolves? as St. John Chrysostom
            reproached the clergy of Antioch. And you, who fly so
            carefully the gross vices of the world, have you no
            care or anxiety about damning yourself by slander?"

            <font size="+1">T</font>HIS must be done especially in
            five circumstances: (1) At the change of Superiors. Do
            not criticize the outgoing Superior nor flatter the new
            one. (2) When you replace another religious. Never by
            word or act cast any blame on him. Inexperience, or a
            desire to introduce new customs, sometimes causes this
            to be done. (3) When you are getting old. Because then
            we are apt to think&mdash; erroneously, of
            course&mdash;that the young members growing up are
            incapable of fulfilling duties once accomplished by
            ourselves. (4) When religious come from another house
            do not ask questions which they ought not to answer,
            and do not tell them anything which might prejudice or
            disgust them with the house or anyone in it. Lastly, in
            our interviews with our particular friends we must be
            very cautious. There are some who, when anything goes
            amiss with them, always seek the company of their
            confidants. These should seriously examine before God
            whether it is a necessary comfort in affliction or a
            support in weakness, or the too human satisfaction of
            justifying themselves, giving vent to their feelings,
            or getting blame and criticism for the Superior or some
            one else. They should also examine whether on such
            occasions they speak the exact truth, and whether they
            seek a friend, who knows how to take the arrow sweetly
            from the wound rather than to bury it deeper.
        </p>
        <p>
            The way to find out the gravity of the sin of
            detraction is&mdash;(1) To consider the position of him
            who speaks and the weight which is attached to his
            words; (2) the position of him who is spoken about, and
            the need he has of his reputation; (3) the evil thing
            said; (4) the number of the hearers; (5) the result of
            the detraction; and, lastly, the intention of the
            speaker, and the passion which was the cause of it.

        <p>
            <font size="+1">T</font>HERE are six sorts of religious
            who wound fraternal charity more or less fatally, (1)
            Those who say to you, "Such a one said so-and-so about
            you." These are the sowers of discord, whom God
            Almighty declares He has in abomination. Their tongues
            have three fangs more terrible than a viper. "With one
            blow," says St. Bernard, "they kill three
            persons&mdash;themselves, the listeners, and the
            absent." (2) Those who, obscuring and perverting this
            amiable virtue, possess the infernal secret of
            transforming it into vice. Is not this to sin against
            the Holy Ghost? (3) Those who skilfully turn the
            conversation on those brethren of whom they are
            jealous, in order to have all put in a bad word. They
            thus double the fault they apparently wish to avoid.
            (4) Those who constantly have their ears cocked to hear
            domestic news, who are skilful in finding out secrets
            and picking up stories, whose trade seems to be to take
            note of all little bits of scandalous news going, and
            to take them from ear to ear, or, worse, from house to
            house. Oh, what an occupation! What a recreation for a
            spouse of Christ! (5) Those who, under pretext of
            enlivening the conversation, sacrifice their brethren
            to the vain and cruel wantonness of witticism by
            relating something funny in order to give a lash of
            their tongue or to expose some weakness. Alas! they
            forget that they ruin themselves in the esteem and
            opinion of the hearers. (6) Critics of intellectual
            work. On this point jealousy betrays itself very easily
            on one side, and susceptibility is stirred on the
            other. The heart is never insensible nor the mouth
            silent when we are wounded in so delicate a part. It is
            evident, besides, that in this case the blame supposes
            a desire of praise, and that in proportion as we
            endeavour to lower our brethren we try to raise
            ourselves. All these religious ought to be regarded as
            pests in the community.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we call those who maintain fraternal charity the
            children of God, should not those who disturb it be
            called the children of Satan? Do they not endeavour to
            turn the abode of peace into a den of discord, and the
            sanctuary of prayer into a porch of hell?

            relate outside, even to ecclesiastics, frivolous

            serve only to bring religion, and those who govern

            Superiors say the exact truth, and for a good purpose.
            Do not speak into other ears that which, strictly
            speaking, should only be told to the local Superior or
            Superior-General. With the exception of extraordinary
            cases, or when it refers to a bad habit or something
            otherwise irremediable, there is generally little
            charity and less prudence in telling the
            Superior-General of something blameable which has
            occurred. Do not reveal, even before a Superior,
            confidences which conscience, probity, or friendship
            requires to be guarded with an inviolable seal of
            friendship. If we write a complaint about a personal
            offence, lessen it rather than exaggerate, and
            endeavour to praise the person for good qualities,
            because nothing is easier than to blacken entirely
            another's reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pray and wait till your emotion be calmed. When passion

            spleen, and the pen is transformed into a sword.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before speaking or writing to the Superior it would be
            well to put this question to ourselves: "Am I one of
            those proud spirits who expose the faults of others in
            order to show off their own pretended virtues? or
            jealous spirits who are offended at the elevation of
            others? or vindictive spirits who like to give tit for
            tat? or polite spirits who wish to appear important? or
            ill-humoured, narrow-minded spirits, scandalized at
            trifles? or credulous, inconsiderate spirits who
            believe and repeat everything&mdash;the bad rather than
            the good? In fine, am I a hypocrite who, clothing
            malice with the mantle of charity, and hiding a cruel
            pleasure under the veil of compassion, weep with the
            victim they intend to immolate, as though profoundly
            touched by his misfortune, and seem to yield only to
            the imperative demands of duty and zeal?"

            The ears of the Superior are sacred, and it is unworthy
            profanation to pour into them false or exaggerated
            reports. To infect the Superior's ears is a greater

            malice), render themselves often guilty of crying acts
            of injustice and ruin a religious. What is uncertain
            they relate as certain, and what is mere conjecture
            they take as the base of grave suspicions. Several
            facts which, taken individually, constitute scarcely a
            fault, they group together, and so make a mountain out
            of a few grains of sand. An act which, seen in its
            entirety, would be worthy of praise, they mutilate in
            such a fashion as to show it in an unfavourable light.
            Enemies of the positive degree, they lavish with
            prodigality the words <i>often, very much,
            exceedingly,</i> etc. When they have only one or two
            witnesses, they make use of the word <i>everybody</i>,
            thereby leaving you under the impression that the
            rumour is scattered broadcast. On such statements, how
            can a Superior pronounce judgment?

            "What discourse hold you among yourselves, and why are

            A holy religious replied to an uncharitable person: "We
            have to render infinite thanks to God if we are not

            The philosopher Zeno, hearing a man relate a number of
            misdeeds about Antisthenes, said to him: "Ah! Has he
            never done anything good? Has he never done anything
            for which he merits praise?" "I don't know," he
            replied. Then said Zeno, "How is that? You have
            sufficient perception to remark, and sufficient memory
            to remember, this long list of faults, and you have had
            no eyes to see his many good qualities and virtuous
            actions."
        </p>
        <p>
            St. John Chrysostom says: "To the calumniator I wish
            you to say the following: If you can praise your
            neighbours, my ears are open to receive your perfume.
            If you can only blacken them, my ears are closed, as I
            do not wish them to be the receptacle of your filthy
            words. What matters it to me to hear that such a one is
            wicked, and has done some detestable act? Friend, think
            of the account that must be rendered to the Sovereign
            Judge. What excuse can we give, and what mercy will we
            deserve&mdash;we who have been so keen-sighted to the
            faults of others, and so blind to our own? You would
            consider it very rude for a person to look into your
            private room; but I say it is far worse to pry into
            another's private life and to expose it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The calumniator should remember that, besides the fault
            he commits and the wrong he does to his neighbours, he
            exposes himself, by a just punishment of God, to be the
            victim of calumny himself.

            It is related in the life of Sister Margaret, of the
            Blessed Sacrament of the Carmelite Order, that when a
            discourse against charity took place in the house she
            saw a smoke arise of such suffocating odour that she
            nearly fainted, and fled immediately to her Divine
            Master for pardon.
        </p>
        <p>
            St. Jerome, writing to Nepotian on this subject, says:
            "Some object that they cannot warn the speaker of his
            fault without failing in the respect due to him. This
            excuse is vain, because their eagerness to listen
            increases his itch for speaking. No one wishes to
            relate calumnies and murmurs to ears closed with
            disgust. Is there anyone so foolish as to shoot arrows
            against a stone wall?" Let your strict silence be a
            significant and salutary lesson for the detractor.
            "Have no commerce with those who bite," said Solomon,
            because perdition is on the eve of overtaking them; and
            who can tell the disaster and ruin with which the rash
            detractor and equally blamable listener are threatened?

        <p>
            If it be true, according to the testimony of a
            religious who was visitor of the houses of his Order,
            that the virtue against which one can most easily
            commit a grievous sin in religion is charity; and,
            according to St. Francis de Sales, sins of the tongue
            number three-fourths of all sins committed; cannot it
            be said with equal truth that to refuse to listen to
            detractors is with one blow to prevent the sin and
            safeguard charity?

        <p>
            In many cases one can adroitly make known the good
            qualities and virtues which more than counterbalance
            the defects related by the defamer. To act thus is to
            spread about the good odour of Christ.

        <p>
            2. Believe all the good you hear, but believe only the
            bad you see. Malice does the contrary. It demands
            proofs for good reports, but believes bad reports on
            the slightest grounds. Out of every thousand reports
            one can scarcely be found accurate in all its details.
            When, as a rule of prudence, Superiors are told to
            believe only half of what they hear, to consider the

        </p>
        <p>
            When the act is evidently blameworthy, suppose a good
            intention, or at least one not so bad as apparent,
            leaving to God what He reserves to Himself the judgment
            of the heart; or consider it as the result of surprise,
            inadvertence, human frailty, or the violence of the
            temptation. Never come to hasty conclusions&mdash;
            <i>e.g.</i>, "He is incorrigible; as he is, so will he
            always be." Expect everything from grace, efforts, and
            time.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Efface as much as possible the bad impression
            produced on the mind, because calumny always produces
            such.
        </p>
        <p>
            The recital of something bad about a fellow-religious
            based on probabilities has sufficed to tarnish a
            reputation which ample apologies cannot fully repair.
            The detractor's evil reports are believed on account of
            the audacity with which he relates them, but when he
            wants to relate something good he will not be believed
            on oath. We know by experience that evil reports spread
            with compound interest, while good ones are retailed at
            discount.

            up vague thoughts of the past, rumours without
            foundation, conjectures in which passion has the

            have of their own ability conclude that all their
            judgments are true, and thus become fixed in their bad
            habit. St. Bernard, comparing them to painters, warns
            them that it is the devil who furnishes the materials,
            and even the evil conceptions, necessary to depict such
            bad impressions of their brethren. We read in the "Life
            of St. Francis" that our Lord Himself called in a
            distinct voice a certain young man to his Order. "O
            Lord," replied the young man, "when I am once entered,
            what must I do to please You?" Pay particular attention
            to our Lord's answer: "Lead thou a life in common with
            the rest. Avoid particular friendships. Take no notice
            of the defects of others, and form no unfavourable
            judgments about them." What matter for consideration in
            these admirable words!

        <p>
            Thomas &agrave; Kempis says: "Turn thy eyes back upon
            thyself, and see thou judge not the doing of others. In
            judging others a man labours in vain, often errs, and
            easily sins; but in judging and looking into himself he
            always labours with fruit. We frequently judge of a
            thing according to the inclination of our hearts,
            because self-love easily alters in us a true judgment."
        </p>
        <p>
            Rodriguez tells us to turn on ourselves the sinister
            questions, etc., we are tempted to refer to others
            <i>e.g.</i>: "It is I who am deceived. It is through
            jealousy that I condemn my brethren. It is through
            malice that I find so much to blame in them. Finally,
            the fault is mine, not theirs."
        </p>
        <p>
            Even when reports more or less true might depreciate in
            your eyes some of the community, may they not have,
            besides their faults, some great but hidden virtues,
            and by these be entitled to a more merciful judgment?
            St. Augustine says beautifully: "If you cast your eye
            over a field where the corn has been trampled, you only
            perceive the straw, not the grain. Lift up the straw,
            and you will see plenty of golden sheaves full of
            grain." The simile is very applicable to a poor
            religious beaten down by foul tongues. We blame the
            defects of our brethren, and perhaps we have the same,
            or others more shameful still. We usurp the right of
            judgment, which God reserves to Himself, and forget
            that He will punish us by leaving us to our own
            irregular passions. Ah! is it not already a very great
            misfortune to have these contemptuous, slanderous,
            distrustful thoughts, and many other sins, the result
            of malicious suspicions and rash judgments, rooted in
            the soul?

            banished from the community, and so to banish it from
            our own heart? Recall the words of St. John of the
            Cross. "Imagine," says he, "that your brethren are so
            many sculptors armed with mallets and chisels, and that
            you have been placed before them as a block of marble
            destined in the mind of God to become a statue

            head; a mockery as a spit in the face; an unkind act as
            a nail in the hand; a hatred which takes the place of

            hurts, contradicts, or humiliates us as the blows,
            stripes, the gall and vinegar, the crown of thorns and
            the cross. The work proceeds always, sometimes slowly,
            sometimes quickly. Let us not complain. We will one day
            thank these workmen, who, without intending it, give to
            our soul the most beautiful, the most glorious, and the
            noblest traits. We ourselves are sculptors as well as
            statues, and we will find that, on our part, we have
            materially helped to form in them the same traits.

        </p>
        <p>
            It is not forbidden us to seek consolation. But from
            whom? Is it from those discontented spirits whose ears
            are like public sewers, the receptacle of every filth
            and dirt? They increase our pain by pouring the poison
            of their own discontent instead of the oil of the Good
            Samaritan. They will take our disease and give us
            theirs, and, like Samson's foxes, spread destruction
            around by repeating what we said to them. May God
            preserve us from this misfortune! If we cannot carry
            our burden alone, and if we find it no relief to lay
            our griefs in the Sacred Heart of Jesus, let us go to
            him whom the rule appoints to be our friend and
            consoler, our confidant and director, and who, as St.
            Augustine relates of St. Monica, after having listened
            to us with patience, charity, and compassion, after
            having at first appeared to share our sentiments, will
            sweeten and explain all with prudence, will lift up and

            What would be considered, when we were in the world, as
            the prick of a needle, we look upon in religion as the
            blow of a sword. What we looked upon in our own house
            as light as a feather, becomes in community life as
            heavy as a rock. An insignificant word becomes an
            outrage, and a little matter which formerly would
            escape our notice now upsets us, and even deprives us
            of sleep and appetite. Is not this increase of
            sensibility and repugnance found in the religious state
            only to form in us the image of our crucified Lord? If
            Christ alone has suffered interiorly more than all the
            Saints and Martyrs together, was it not because of this
            extreme repugnance of His soul, which multiplied to
            infinity for Him the bitterness of the affronts and the
            rigour of His torments? Religious may expect for a
            certainty that, like their Divine Master, there are
            reserved for them moments of complete abandonment,
            those agonies intended for the souls of the elect, in
            which Nature seems on the point of succumbing. No
            consolation from their families, which they have
            quitted; nor from their companions, who are busy in
            their various employments; nor from their Superiors,
            who do not understand the excess of their grief, and
            whose words by Divine permission produce no effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            The solemn moment of agony with our Divine Saviour was
            that in which, abandoned, betrayed, and denied by His
            Apostles, and perceiving in His Father only an
            irritated face, He exclaimed, "My God! My God! why hast
            Thou forsaken Me?" Such will be for religious the last
            touch which will complete in them the resemblance of
            Jesus crucified, provided they will render themselves
            worthy of it.

            In every community we can distinguish two sorts of

            descend&mdash;those whose face is towards the path of
            perfection, and those who have turned their back to it.
            Perhaps amongst these latter some have only one more
            step to abandon it altogether. Now we mount or descend,
            proceed or retrace our steps, in proportion as we
            practise these four virtues or neglect them.

            A religious Order is like a fire balloon, which
            requires four conditions in order to rise into the
            clouds amidst the applause of the spectators. First,
            the rarefaction of the air by fire. This represents the
            vow of poverty, which empties the heart through the
            hands, and substitutes the desire of heavenly goods for
            those of earth. Second, release from the cords which
            bind it down. This represents the effects of the vow of
            chastity, which, by breaking human attachments, permits
            us to soar towards God with freedom and rapidity.
            Third, a man who will feed the fire and moderate the
            flight of the balloon upwards. This represents the
            right which the vow of obedience places in the hands of
            the Superior, to nourish the sacred fire, and direct
            the sublime movement of the soul and foresee dangers.
            Fourth, the union of its component parts. This
            represents the operations of charity, in causing all
            the members of a community to have but one heart and
            one soul.
        </p>
        <p>
            Possessing these four virtues, a religious Order soars
            in the heights of perfection; but if one of these be
            wanting it falls helplessly, and is no longer an object
            of edification, but of scandal and ridicule.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it happens that some members, losing the spirit of
            their state, abandon their holy vocation, we may say
            with St. John: "They went out from us; but they were
            not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no
            doubt have continued with us: but that they might be
            made manifest that they are not all of us" (1 John
            ii.). They appeared to have the religious virtues, but
            in reality one or all were wanting to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            O God, do not permit that lukewarmness or an
            uncontrolled passion will ever make me waver in my
            vocation. During life and at death I wish to remain a
            faithful religious, so that I may find the salvation
            which Thou hast promised by procuring Thy glory. As
            good grain improves by pulling up the weeds, and the
            body becomes healthy when purged of bad humours, pour
            into my soul the grace and unction which others refuse,
            in order that, practising more perfectly from day to
            day poverty, chastity, obedience, and charity, and
            redoubling my ardour and zeal to my last hour, I may
            obtain the priceless treasure promised to those who
            have quitted all to follow Thee. Amen.

        </p>
        <p>
            2. Reflect on the opposite faults in yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Do this most in the case of those whom we are most
            inclined to criticize.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Never claim rights or even let ourselves feel that
            we have them, as this spirit is most fatal both to
            obedience and charity.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Charitable thoughts are the only security of
            charitable deeds and words. They save us from
            surprises, especially from surprises of temper.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. Never have an aversion for another, much less
            manifest it.

        <p>
            7. Avoid particular friendships.
        </p>
        <p>
            8. Never judge another. Always, if possible, excuse the
            faults we see, and if we cannot excuse the action,
            excuse the intention. We cannot all think alike, and we
            should, therefore, avoid attributing bad motives to
            others.

            CHARITABLE RELIGIOUS
        </p>
        <p>
            They have a disregard of self and a desire to
            accommodate others. They rejoice with their companions
            in their joys and recreations, and grieve with them in
            their afflictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            They try to bring all the good they can to the
            community and to avert all the evil. They begin with
            themselves, by being as little trouble as possible to
            others.
        </p>
        <p>
            With great charity and affability they bear with the
            faults and shortcomings of others, careful to fulfil
            the law of Christ, which tells us to bear one another's
            burdens.
        </p>
        <p>
            They dispense to others what they have for their own
            advantage; more particularly do they give spiritual
            assistance by prayer and the other spiritual works of
            mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
            They never contradict anyone. They never speak against
            anyone. They are convinced that charity, holy
            friendships, and concord form the great solace of this
            life, and that no good ever came from dissensions and
            disputes.
        </p>
        <p>
            They consider that God is ever in the midst of those
            who live united together by the bonds of holy love.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will do likewise if we consider the image of God in
            the souls of our brethren. As we form one body here and
            one spirit in the same faith and charity, let us hope
            not to be separated hereafter, but to belong for ever
            to that one body in heaven when faith and hope shall
            disappear, but where charity alone shall remain, and
            remain for ever.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
