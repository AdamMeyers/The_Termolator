<h2>
	PREFACE.
</h2>

<p>
The object of the "GOOD CHILD'S LIBRARY," is to encourage a taste for
Scripture reading, by presenting some of the most interesting portions
of the New Testament narrative, in the attractive form of verse. While
the children read these verses, they will not only become acquainted
with the principal events in the lives of our Blessed Saviour and His
Apostles&mdash;their travels, their sufferings and their death,&mdash;but they
will see that the Bible is a readable book, and a book that may be read
every day, without any fear of becoming the unhappy being that some
persons suppose; and besides this, the tone which is given to the
affections, the minds, and the morals of children by such reading, is of
almost infinite value.
</p>
<p>
In order to combine things pleasing and things useful, to the greatest
possible extent, the publishers have gotten up at a great expense,
especially for this work, some of the most beautiful Scripture designs
that have ever been published. These pictures are printed in Oil
Colours&mdash;an expensive, but a finished and highly artistical process, of
which the publishers are the originators in this country. Each history
is illustrated handsomely with them.
</p>
<p>
There is in all twelve books; each book being complete in itself, and
containing a full history.
</p>
<p>
The "GOOD CHILD'S LIBRARY" is composed of the following books:
</p>
<pre>
  Scenes in the Life of the Saviour.
  Scenes in the Life of St. Peter.
  Scenes in the Life of St. John.
  Scenes in the Life of St. Paul.
  Scenes in the Lives of St. Matthew,
    St. Jude, and St. Simon.
  Scenes in the Lives of St. Stephen,
    Timothy, St. Mark, and St. Luke.
  Scenes in the Lives of St. Philip, St.
    Bartholomew, and St. Thomas.
  Scenes in the Lives of St. Andrew,
    St. James, and St. James the Less.
  The Sermon on the Mount.
  The Parables of the Saviour.
  The Miracles of the Saviour.
  Texts for Children.
</pre>
<p>
The Publishers have in preparation another series, embracing Scenes in
the Lives of the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Kings, illustrative of the
Old Testament Scriptures, to be gotten up in the same style as the
present series.

OF THE SOWER.
</center>
 <div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
  Behold a sower going forth
  <p class="i2">To scatter o'er his field,</p>
  The seed that in the harvest time
  <p class="i2">A rich return will yield.</p>
	     </div>

   <div class="stanza">
  And as he sow'd some precious seeds,
  <p class="i2">Were by the way-side thrown;</p>
  The fowls of heaven descried them there,
  <p class="i2">And soon the seed were gone.</p>
	     </div>

   <div class="stanza">
  And other seeds fell from his hand
  <p class="i2">On stony places round,</p>
  And forthwith they sprung up, because
  <p class="i2">They had no depth of ground.</p>
	     </div>

   <div class="stanza">
  But when the sun came up, and warm
  <p class="i2">Sent forth his beaming ray,</p>
  Because they had no root in earth,
  <p class="i2">They wither'd all away.</p>
	     </div>

   <div class="stanza">
  Among the thorns some others fell,
  <p class="i2">Of these there was no hope;</p>
  The seeds were choked, they droop'd and died,
  <p class="i2">Soon as the thorns came up.</p>
	     </div>

   <div class="stanza">
  But others fell into good ground,
  <p class="i2">And yielded, as we're told,</p>
  Some of them thirty, sixty some,
  <p class="i2">And some an hundred fold.</p>
	     </div>

   <div class="stanza">
  The seed that by the wayside fell,
  <p class="i2">Is wisdom in the heart</p>
  Of him who heareth words of truth,
  <p class="i2">But understandeth not.</p>
	     </div>
   <div class="stanza">
  And he who is the stony place,
  <p class="i2">Is one who hears the word,</p>
  Anon with joy receiveth it,
  <p class="i2">And follows after good.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  But tribulation soon assails,
  <p class="i2">And persecutions rise,</p>
  He then forgets the word of truth,
  <p class="i2">And all his goodness dies.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  The thorny place is one who hears,
  <p class="i2">And does the truth receive;</p>
  But finds that cares of life and wealth,
  <p class="i2">His mind and heart deceive.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  The good and fertile ground is he
  <p class="i2">Who hears and understands;</p>
  And shows his, life obedient to
  <p class="i2">All that the truth commands.</p>

THE TARES AND THE WHEAT.

 <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
  <p>My kingdom I will liken to,</p>
  <p class="i2">A man who in his field</p>
  <p>Sow'd good seed, and expected soon</p>
  <p class="i2">A harvest it would yield.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>But while his servants slept, there came</p>
  <p class="i2">A wicked enemy,</p>
  <p>And sow'd his <i>tares</i> among the wheat,</p>
  <p class="i2">And then went on his way.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>And when the good seed did appear</p>
  <p class="i2">The tares began to show;</p>
  <p>The servants wonder'd much, and said,</p>
  <p class="i2">"Why, master, thou didst sow</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>"The best of seed all o'er the field,</p>
  <p class="i2">From whence then come these tares?"</p>
  <p>"An enemy," he said, "hath come</p>
  <p class="i2">Upon us unawares,</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>"And scattered forth his evil seed;"</p>
  <p class="i2">The servants said to him,</p>
  <p>"Wilt thou then, that into the field</p>
  <p class="i2">We go and gather them?"</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>The master answer'd them and said,</p>
  <p class="i2">"Let both together grow,</p>
  <p>Until the time of harvest, lest</p>
  <p class="i2">Ye pluck the wheat also.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>"And when the time of harvest comes,</p>
  <p class="i2">The wheat shall in my barn</p>
  <p>Be gather'd; but the tares I'll bind</p>
  <p class="i2">And in the fire burn."</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>The children of the kingdom are</p>
  <p class="i2">The good seed that is sown,</p>
  <p>The tares that came up with the wheat</p>
  <p class="i2">Are of the evil one.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>The enemy who sow'd the tares,</p>
  <p class="i2">Is he who fell afar;</p>
  <p>The harvest, when the world shall end;</p>
  <p class="i2">The angels reapers are.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>The righteous shall be gather'd home</p>
  <p class="i2">Forever with the Lord;</p>
  <p>And as the tares are burn'd, so shall</p>
  <p class="i2">The wicked be destroy'd.</p>

THE UNMERCIFUL SERVANT.
</center>
 <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
  <p>Once Peter said, "How oft shall I</p>
  <p class="i2">My brother's sin forgive?</p>
  <p>How oft shall I, if he confess,</p>
  <p class="i2">His penitence receive?"</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>"Till seven times?" The Saviour said,</p>
  <p class="i2">"<i>This</i> is the law of Heaven,</p>
  <p>Thou shalt thy brother's sin forgive,</p>
  <p class="i2">Till seventy times seven.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>My kingdom, therefore, I will like</p>
  <p class="i2">Unto a certain king,</p>
  <p>Who said that he his servants all</p>
  <p class="i2">To an account would bring.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>The first who came was one who did</p>
  <p class="i2">Ten thousand talents owe;</p>
  <p>And when he could not pay his lord,</p>
  <p class="i2">His heart was fill'd with wo."</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>The lord unto his servants said,</p>
  <p class="i2">"This debt must now be paid,</p>
  <p>Go sell his wife and children too,</p>
  <p class="i2">Let payment now be made."</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>The debtor to his master came,</p>
  <p class="i2">And at his feet did fall,</p>
  <p>"Have patience with me, lord," he said,</p>
  <p class="i2">"And I will pay thee all."</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>His heart was with compassion moved,</p>
  <p class="i2">He freely did relieve</p>
  <p>His heart of sorrow, for at once</p>
  <p class="i2">He all the debt forgave.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>This servant then went out and found,</p>
  <p class="i2">One of his fellows near,</p>
  <p>Who owed to him an hundred pence;</p>
  <p class="i2">And spake to him severe.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>He took him by the throat, and said,</p>
  <p class="i2">"Now what thou owest, pay,</p>
  <p>I'll wait no longer for the debt,</p>
  <p class="i2">But it must have to-day."</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>This servant then with grief and wo,</p>
  <p class="i2">Down at his feet did fall:</p>
  <p>"My fellow servant, patience have,</p>
  <p class="i2">And I will pay thee all."</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>He would not; but with hardness did</p>
  <p class="i2">His own sad case forget;</p>
  <p>His debtor into prison cast</p>
  <p class="i2">Till he should pay the debt.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>His fellow servants heard the tale,</p>
  <p class="i2">And all with one accord,</p>
  <p>To show his base ingratitude,</p>
  <p class="i2">Came sorrowing to their lord.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>And told him all the servant did;</p>
  <p class="i2">And he was very wroth,</p>
  <p>And to those present said, "Go call</p>
  <p class="i2">The wicked servant forth."</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>He to him said, "Thou wicked one,</p>
  <p class="i2">Did I not thee forgive</p>
  <p>Ten thousand talents? Couldst not thou,</p>
  <p class="i2">Thy fellow's debt relieve?</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>"Couldst thou not mercy show to him,</p>
  <p class="i2">As I did show to thee,</p>
  <p>Forgiving thee at once the debt,</p>
  <p class="i2">As thou desiredst me?</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>Now therefore pay me all the debt,</p>
  <p class="i2">I will not thee forgive,</p>
  <p>Because thou didst not let him go,</p>
  <p class="i2">And all his we relieve."</p>
     </div>
     <div class="stanza">
  <p>That mercy then that you would have,</p>
  <p class="i2">You must to others show;</p>
  <p>merciful and kind to all,</p>
  <p class="i2">And you will mercy know.</p>

  <p>A certain lawyer came to Christ,</p>

  <p>There was a certain man who had</p>

  <p>His barns were small, and they were fill'd;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
