<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>To those who are fortunate enough to know
Miss Alexander's pen and pencil pictures of
Italian peasant life the very name of Francesca,
over which her early work was published,
carries with it an aroma as of those humbler graces
of her adopted people,—their sunny charity,
their native sense of the beautiful, their childlike
faith,—which touch the heart more intimately
than all their great achievements in History and
in Art.  For those, however, to whom are yet
unknown her faithful transcripts in picture and
story from the lives of the people she loves, a
word of introduction has been asked; and it was
perhaps thought that the task might properly be
entrusted to one who had heard </span><em class="italics">The Hidden
Servants</em><span> and many another of these poems
from the lips of Francesca herself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Yet, rightly considered, could any experience
have better served to banish from the mind such
irrelevant intruders as facts,—those literal facts
and data at least which the uninitiated might be
so mistaken as to desire, but which none who
knew Francesca's work could regard as of the
slightest consequence?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Imagine a quiet, green-latticed room in Venice
overlooking the Grand Canal whose waters
keep time in gently audible lappings to the lilt
of the verse,—that lilt that is apparent even in
the printed line, but which only a voice trained
to Italian cadences can perfectly give.  Imagine
that voice half chanting, half reciting, these old,
old legends, and with an absolute sincerity of
conviction which stirs the mind of the listeners,
mere children of to-day though they be, to a
faith akin to that which conceived the tales.
Where is there place for facts in such a scene,
in such an experience?  Or, if facts must be,
are not all that are requisite easily to be gleaned
from the poems themselves?  Why state that
Francesca is the daughter of an American artist,
or that she has spent her life in Italy, when the
artist inheritance, the Italian atmosphere, breathes
in every poem our little book contains?  Why
make mention even of Ruskin's enthusiastic
heralding of her work, when the very spirit of
it is so essentially that which the great idealist
was seeking all his life that he could scarcely
have failed to discover and applaud it had it been
ever so retiring, ever so hidden?  Nor does it
matter that the Alexander home chances to be in
Florence rather than in Venice, since it is Italy
itself that lives in Francesca's work; nor that
she is Protestant rather than Catholic, when it
is religion pure and simple, unrestricted by any
creed, that makes vital each line she writes or
draws.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Yet of the poems, if not of the writer, there
remained still something to learn, and accordingly
a letter of inquiry was sent her; and her
own reply, written with no thought of publication,
is a better report than another could give.
This is what she says:—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"With regard to this present collection of
ballads, I can tell its history in a few words.
When I was a young girl many old and curious
books fell into my hands and became my favourite
reading (next to the Bible, and, perhaps, the
</span><em class="italics">Divina Commedia</em><span>), as I found in them the
strong faith and simple modes of thought which
were what I liked and wanted.  Afterwards, in
my constant intercourse with the country people,
and especially with old people whom I always
loved, I heard a great many legends and
traditions, often beautiful, often instructive, and
which, as far as I knew, had never been written
down.  I was always in request with children
for the stories which I knew and could tell, and,
as I found they liked these legends, I thought it
a pity they should be lost after I should have
passed away, and so I always meant to write
them down; all the more that I had felt the
need of such reading when I was a child myself.
But I never had time to write them as long as
my eyes permitted me to work at my drawing,
and afterwards, when I wanted to begin them,
I found myself unable to write at all for more
than a few minutes at once.  Finally I thought
of turning the stories into rhyme and learning
them all by heart, so that I could write them
down little by little.  I thought children would
not be very particular, if I could just make the
dear old stories vivid and comprehensible, which
I tried to do.  If, as you kindly hope, they may
be good for older people as well, then it must be
that when the Lord took from me one faculty
He gave me another; which is in no way
impossible.  And I think of the beautiful Italian
proverb: 'When God shuts a door He opens a
window.'"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After such an account of the origin and
growth of these poems no further comment
would seem fitting, unless it be that made by
Cardinal Manning when writing to Mr. Ruskin
in 1883 to thank him for a copy of Francesca's
</span><em class="italics">Story of Ida</em><span>.  He writes:—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is simply beautiful, like the </span><em class="italics">Fioretti di San

alone.  They can be found only in the Garden

visibly, and is more intensely seen by the poor
and the pure in heart than by the rich, or the
learned, or the men of culture."</span></p>

<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>A sheltered nook on a mountain side,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Shut in, and guarded, and fortified</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>By rocks that hardly a goat would climb,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>All smoothed by tempest and bleached by time—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Such was the spot that the hermit chose,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From youth to age, for his life's repose.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There had he lived for forty years,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Trying, with penance and prayers and tears,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To make his soul like a polished stone</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In God's great temple; for this alone</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was the one dear wish that his soul possessed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And 't was little he cared for all the rest,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Nothing had changed since first he came;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The sky and the mountain were all the same,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Only a beech-tree, that there had grown</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Ere ever he builded his cell of stone,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had risen and spread to a stately grace,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And its shifting shadow filled half the place.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Many a winter its storms had spent,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Many a summer its sunshine lent</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To the little cell, till it came to look</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Like another rock in the peaceful nook.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Mosses and lichen had veiled the wall,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till it hardly seemed like a dwelling at all.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>'T was a peaceful home when the days were soft,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And spring in her sweetness crept aloft</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From the plains below where her work was done,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the hills grew green in the warming sun.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And in summer the cell of the hermit seemed</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Like part of that heaven of which he dreamed:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the turf behind those walls of flint</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was sprinkled with flowers of rainbow tint;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And never a sound but the bees' low hum,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As over the blossoms they go and come;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or—when one listened—the fainter tones</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of a spring that bubbled between the stones.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But dreary it was on a winter's night,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When the snow fell heavy and soft and white.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And at times, when the morn was cold and keen,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The footprints of wolves at his door were seen.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But cold or hunger he hardly felt,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So near to heaven the good man dwelt;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And as for danger—why, death, to him,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Meant only joining the Seraphim!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Poorly he lived, and hardly fared;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And when the acorns and roots he shared</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With mole or squirrel, he asked no more,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But thanked the Lord for such welcome store.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The richest feast he could ever know</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was when the shepherds who dwelt below,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Whose sheep in the mountain pastures fed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Would bring him cheeses, or barley bread,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or—after harvest—a bag of meal;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And then they would all before him kneel,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On flowery turf or on moss-grown rocks,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To ask a blessing for them and their flocks,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And once or twice he had wandered out</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To preach in the country round about,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where unto many his words were blest;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then back he climbed to his quiet nest.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>By all in trouble his aid was sought;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And women their pining children brought,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For a touch of his hand to ease their pain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And his prayers to make them strong again.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And now one wish in his heart remained:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He longed to know what his soul had gained,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And how he had grown in the Master's grace,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Since first he came to that lonely place.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>This wish was haunting him night and day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He never could drive the thought away.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Until at length in the beech-tree's shade</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He knelt, and with all his soul he prayed</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That God would grant him to know and see</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A man, if such in the world might be,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To the self-same measure as his own;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Whose treasure on the celestial shore</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Could neither be less than his nor more.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He prayed with faith, and his prayer was heard;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He hardly came to the closing word</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Before he felt there was some one there!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He looked, and saw in the sun-lit air</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>An angel, floating on wings of white;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Nor did he wonder at such a sight:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For angels often had come to cheer</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>His soul, and he thought them always near.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Happy and humble, he bowed his head,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And listened, while thus the angel said:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Go to the nearest town, and there,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To-morrow, will be in the market square</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A mountebank, playing his tricks for show:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He is the man thou hast prayed to know;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>His soul, as seen by the light divine,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Is neither better nor worse than thine.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>His treasure on the celestial shore</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Is neither less than thine own nor more."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Next day, in the dim and early morn,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>By a slippery path that the sheep had worn,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The hermit went from his loved abode</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To the farms below, and the beaten road.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The reapers, out in the field that day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who saw him passing, did often say,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>What a mournful look the old man had!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And his very voice was changed and sad.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Troubled he was, and much perplexed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With endless doubting his mind was vexed.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>What—He?  A mountebank?  Both the same?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>What could it mean to his soul but shame?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had his forty years been vainly spent?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And then, alas! as he onward went,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There came an evil and bitter thought,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had he been serving the Lord for nought?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But in his fear he began to pray,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the black temptation passed away.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Perhaps the mountebank yet might prove</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To have a soul in the Master's love.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He almost felt that it must be so,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In spite of a life that seemed so low.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Perhaps he was forced such life to take,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It might be, even for conscience' sake;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Some cruel master the order gave,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Perhaps, for scorn of a pious slave.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or, stay—there were saints in ancient days,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who had such terror of human praise</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That, but to gain the contempt they prized,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They did such things as are most despised;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Feigned even madness; and more than one,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Accused of sins he had never done,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had willingly borne disgrace and blame,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Nor said a word for his own good name!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>In thoughts like these had the day gone by;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The sun was now in the western sky:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The road, grown level and hot and wide,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With dusty hedges on either side,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had led him close to the city gate,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where he must enter to learn his fate.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Now fear did over his hope prevail:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He almost wished in his search to fail,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And find no mountebank there at all!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For then his vision he well might call</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A dream that came of its own accord,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Instead of a message from the Lord!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A few more minutes, and then he knew</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That all which the angel said was true!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>A mountebank, in the market square,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was making the people laugh and stare.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With antics more befitting an ape</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Than any creature in human shape!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The hermit took his place with the rest,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Not heeding the crowd that round him pressed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And earnestly set his eyes to scan</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The face of the poor, unsaintly man.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Alas, there was little written there</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of inward peace or of answered prayer!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For all the paint, and the droll grimace,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was a haggard, anxious, weary face.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The mountebank saw, with vague surprise,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The patient, sorrowful, searching eyes,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Whose look, so solemn, and kindly too,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Seemed piercing all his disguises through.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They made him restless, he knew not why:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He could not play; it was vain to try!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>His face grew sober, his movements slow;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And, soon as might be, he closed the show.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He saw that the hermit lingered on,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When all the rest of the crowd were gone.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then over his gaudy clothes he drew</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A ragged mantle of faded hue;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he himself was the first to speak:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Good Father, is it for me you seek?"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"My son, I have sought you all the day;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Would you come with me a little way,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Into some quiet corner near,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where no one our words can overhear?"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Not far away, in a lonely street,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>By a garden wall they found a seat.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It now was late, and the sun had set,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Though a golden glory lingered yet,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the moon looked pale in it overhead.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They sat them down, and the hermit said:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"My son, to me was a vision sent,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And as yet I know not what it meant;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But I think that you, and you alone,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Are able to make its meaning known.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Answer me then—I have great need—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And tell me, what is the life you lead?"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"My life's a poor one, you may suppose!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I 've many troubles that no one knows;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For I have to keep a smiling face.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I wander, friendless, from place to place,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Risking my neck for a scanty gain;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But I must do it, and not complain.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I know, whatever may go amiss,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That I have deserved much worse than this."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>To the hermit this a meaning bore</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of deep humility, nothing more.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So, gaining courage, "But this," he said,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Is not the life you have always led.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So much the vision to me revealed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I know there 's something you keep concealed."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The mountebank answered sadly: "Yes!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T is true: you ask, and I must confess.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But keep my secret, good Father, pray;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or my life will not be safe for a day!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Alas, I have led a life of crime!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I 've been an evil man in my time.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I was a robber—I think you know—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till little more than a year ago;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>One of a desperate, murderous band,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A curse and terror to all the land!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The hermit's head sank down on his breast;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>His trembling hands to his eyes he pressed.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Has God rejected me?" then he moaned:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Are all my service and love disowned?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Have I been blind, and my soul deceived?"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The other, seeing the old man grieved,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Said: "Father, why do you care so much</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For one not worthy your robe to touch?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The Lord is gracious, and if He will,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He can forgive and save me still.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And as for my wicked life, 't is I,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Not you, who have reason to weep and sigh!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Your prayers may help me, and bring me peace."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The hermit made him a sign to cease;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then raised his head, and began to speak,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With tears on his wrinkled, sun-browned cheek.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"If you could remember even one</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Good deed that you in your life have done,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I need not go in despair away.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Think well; and if you can find one, say!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"Once," said the mountebank, "that was all,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I did for the Lord a service small,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And never yet have I told the tale!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But if you wish it, I will not fail.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A few of our men had gone one day—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was less for plunder, I think, than play—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To a certain convent, small and poor,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where a dozen sisters lived secure</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For very poverty! dreaming not</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That any envied their humble lot.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There, finding the door was locked and barred,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They climbed the wall of a grass-grown yard.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Some vines were planted along its side,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Their trailing branches left room to hide;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where, neither by pity moved nor shame,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They crouched, till one of the sisters came</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To gather herbs for the noonday meal;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then out from under the leaves they steal!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So she was taken, poor soul, and bound,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And carried off to our camping ground.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A harmless creature, who knew no more</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of the world outside her convent door,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Than you or I of the moon up there!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A shame, to take her in such a snare!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"But, Father, I wished that I had been</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Ten miles away, when they brought her in,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To hold for ransom; or if that failed—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Oh, well, we knew when the pirates sailed!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We knew their captain, who paid us well,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And carried our prisoners off to sell.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They never beheld their country more,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Being bought for slaves on a foreign shore.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"But oh! 't was enough the tears to bring,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To see that innocent, frightened thing,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Looking, half hopeful, from face to face,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As if she thought, in that wicked place,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There might be one who would take her part!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She looked at me, and it stung my heart.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But I, with a hard, disdainful air,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Turned from her as one who did not care,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I heard her sighing: she did not know</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That her gentle look had hurt me so!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"That night they set me the watch to keep;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And when the others were all asleep,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And I had been moving to and fro,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With branches keeping the fire aglow,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I crept along to the woman's side,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She sat apart, and her arms were tied,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And said,—'t was only a whispered word;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We both were lost if the others heard,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'If you will trust me and with me come,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I 'll bring you safe to your convent home.'</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She started, into my face she gazed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Said she, 'I'll trust you—the Lord be praised!'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"I very quickly the cords unbound.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She rose; I led her without a sound</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Between the rows of the sleeping men,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till we left the camp behind; and then</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I found my horse, that was tied near by.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The woman mounted, and she and I</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Set off in haste, through the midnight shade,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On the wildest journey I ever made!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>By wood and thicket the horse I led,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And over a torrent's stony bed,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For along the road I dared not go,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For fear that the others our flight should know,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And follow after; the woman prayed.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I, quick and cautious, but not afraid,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Went first, with the stars for guide, until</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We saw the convent, high on a hill.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We reached the door as the east grew red.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'God will remember!' was all she said;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Her face was full of a sweet content.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She knocked, they opened, and in she went.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The door was closed—she was safe at last!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I heard the bolt as they made it fast—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And I in the twilight stood alone,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With the lightest heart I had ever known!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"So, Father, my robber days were o'er;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I could not be what I was before.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I wandered on with a thankful mind,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For I left the old bad life behind,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And tried, as I journeyed day by day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To gain my bread in an honest way.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But little work could I find to do;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And so, as some juggling tricks I knew,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I took this business which now you see:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T is good enough for a man like me!"</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>While yet the story was going on,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The cloud from the hermit's face had gone;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And if his eyes in the moonlight shone,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They glistened with thankful tears alone.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He listened in solemn awe until</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The mountebank's tale was done; and still,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Some moments, he neither spoke nor stirred,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But silently pondered every word.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then humbly speaking, "The Lord," said he,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Has had great mercy on you and me!</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>I came to speak with you—know that I</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Have tried with the Lord alone to dwell,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For forty years, in my mountain cell;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In prayer and solitude, day and night,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Have striven to keep my candle bright!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And there, but yesterday, while I prayed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>An angel came to my side, and said</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That I should seek you,—and told me where,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And should your life with my own compare;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For in God's service and love and grace</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Your soul with mine has an equal place,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We both alike have his mercy shared,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The same reward is for both prepared.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I came; I sought you—and you know how</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I found you out in the square just now!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>At which—may the Lord forgive my pride!—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>At first I was poorly satisfied.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But now I have heard your story through—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>What you in a single night could do!—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And know that this to the Lord appears</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Worth all my service of forty years;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I can but wonder, and thank His grace</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Which raised us both to an equal place,"</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"But, Father, it never can be true!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>What?—I by the side of a saint like you?</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Were mindful of him, and brought him all</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He needed now, for his wants were small.</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Little he said, but his every word</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was saved and treasured by those who heard,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>When he should be theirs no more; and some</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>The prayer he had made twelve years before,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Only to know, before he died,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>If he were worthy to stand beside</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>One of God's children, or great or small,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who served Him truly; and that was all!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>It was not long ere the angel came,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who, gently calling the saint by name,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Said: "Come, for thou hast not far to go.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>One step, and I to thine eyes will show</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The very dwelling that shelters now</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Two souls as near to the Lord as thou!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The hermit rose; and with reverent tread</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He followed on as the angel led.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where a single cleft the rocks between</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Gave passage out of the valley green</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They passed, and stood in the pathway steep:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The rocks about them were sunken deep</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In fern, and bramble, and purple heath,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That sloped away to the woods beneath;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While far below, and on every side,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Were endless mountains, and forests wide,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And scattered villages here and there,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That all looked near in the clear, dry air.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And here a church, with its belfry tall;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And there a convent, whose massive wall</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Rose grave and stately above the trees.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The hermit willingly looked at these;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For hope they gave him that now, at least,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Some praying brother or toiling priest</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Might be his mate; but it was not so!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The angel showed him, away below,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A slope where a little mountain-farm</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Lay, all spread out in the sunshine warm,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Along the side of a wooded hill.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It looked so peaceful and far and still!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And when his eye on the farmhouse fell,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The angel said: "It is there they dwell!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Two women in heart and soul like thee.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Go, find them, Brother, and thou shalt see</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>All that thou art in their lives displayed."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Before the hermit an answer made,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The angel back to the skies had flown;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He stood in the rocky path alone.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Along the broken and winding way</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Between the heath and the boulders gray;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Through lonely pastures that led him down</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To oaken woods in their autumn brown;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And o'er the stones of a rippling stream,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The hermit passed, like one in a dream!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As though the vision, had made him strong:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He hardly knew that the way was long.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>'T was almost noon when he came in sight</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of the little farmhouse, low and white:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A sheltered lane by the orchard led,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where mountain ash, with its berries red,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Rose high above him; and brambles, grown</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>All over the rough, low wall of stone,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And tangled brier with thorny spray,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And feathered clematis, edged the way.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then, turning shortly, a view he caught</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of both the women for whom he sought.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>One, spinning, sat by the open door;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Her spindle danced on the worn stone floor.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The other, just from the forest come,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had brought a bundle of branches home,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And spread them now in the sun to dry;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But both looked up as the saint drew nigh.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then, on a sudden, the spindle stopped,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The branches all on the grass were dropped.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He heard them joyfully both exclaim,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"The Saint!  The hermit!"  And forth they came</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To bid him welcome, and made request</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That he would enter their house to rest.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But when a blessing they both implored,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He had not courage to speak the word.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The only blessing his lips let fall</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was this: "May the good Lord bless us all,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And keep our hearts in His peace divine!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With hand uplifted, he made the sign,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then entered in (to their joy complete!)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And willingly took the offered seat.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And soon before him a meal was spread,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of chestnuts, of goat's milk cheese, and bread;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While one with her pitcher went to bring</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Some water fresh from the ice-cold spring.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He could not taste of the food prepared</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till he his errand to both declared.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Said he: "My friends, I have come to-day</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With something grave on my mind to say,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And more to hear; and I pray you now</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To answer truly, and not allow</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A feeling, whether of pride or shame,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or any shrinking from praise or blame,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To change the answer you both may give,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of what you are and of how you live."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then she with distaff still at her side,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of speech more ready, at once replied.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In years the elder, but not in face,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She kept a little of youthful grace:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The dark eyes under her snow-white hair</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Were keen and clear as the autumn air!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"We are but what we appear to be:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Two toiling women, as you may see!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And neither so young nor strong as when</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In field and forest we helped the men.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We now have only the lesser care,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To keep the house, and the meals prepare,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And other labours of small account,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet something worth in the week's amount.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But in our youth, and a lifetime through,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We laboured, much as the others do!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Through storm and sunshine we still have tried</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To do our best by our husbands' side.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And keep their hearts and our own at rest</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When sickness came or when want oppressed.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For even famine our house assailed</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That year when the corn and chestnuts failed.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And once—that winter ten years ago—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Our house was buried beneath the snow,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And ere it melted and light returned,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The very benches for warmth we burned!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Nor is there want, in our busy hive,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of children keeping the house alive:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For she has seven, and I have nine;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But three of hers and the first of mine</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Are safe with Jesus,—more happy they!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Two more have married and gone away.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>My son's young wife, with her infant small,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Make up the household—fourteen in all."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"In this," he said, "there is much to praise:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In humble service you pass your days,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And spend your life for your children's needs.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But tell me now of the pious deeds</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>(For such there are) that you seek to hide,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To me in a vision signified!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"But, sir, we are just two poor old wives.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who never have done in all our lives</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A pious deed that was worth the name!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She said; and her white head drooped with shame.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then said the other: "And yet, 't is true,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We help in all that our husbands do.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When twice a year they have killed a sheep,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T is only half for ourselves we keep;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Our poorer neighbours have all the rest.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And this, I fear, is the very best</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We ever do!"  "And," said he, "'t is well!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But think—is there nothing more to tell?"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>They both were silent a little space,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And each one questioned the other's face,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till, doubtful, when she had thought awhile,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The elder said, with a modest smile:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"This summer have forty years gone by,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Since she—my sister-in-law—and I</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Together came in this house to dwell;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And, Father, it is not much to tell,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But in all these years, from first to last,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>No angry word has between us passed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Nor even a look that was less than kind.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And that is all I can call to mind."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Enough it was for the hermit's need!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He rose, like one from a burden freed.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Thank God!" he said; "if indeed He sees</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>My soul as worthy and white as these!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And great the mercy He doth bestow,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That I should His hidden servants know!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>A sudden flash, as of heavenly light,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then shone within him, and all was bright;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And in a moment were things made clear</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had vexed him many a weary year!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For he, who had thought on earth to view</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>God's people only a scattered few,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Saw now, in spirit, an army great</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of hidden servants who on Him wait.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>No saintly legends their names disclose,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And no man living their number knows,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Nor can their service and place declare.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The hidden servants are everywhere!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And some are hated, despised, alone;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And some to even themselves unknown.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the Father's house has room for all,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And never one from His hand can fall!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The one brave deed of a desperate man,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Grown hard in crime since his youth began,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who yet, for a helpless woman's sake,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had strength to rise, and his chain to break;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The holy sweetness that fills the heart</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of him who dwells from the world apart,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>His life one dream of celestial things,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till almost heaven to earth he brings;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or yet the humble, unnoticed life</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of toiling mother and patient wife,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who, year on year, has had grace to bear</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Her changeless burden of daily care,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Are all accepted with equal love,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And laid with treasures that wait above</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Until the day when we all believe</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That every man shall his deeds receive.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And when, that evening, with weary feet</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The hermit stood by his lone retreat,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And watched awhile, with a tranquil gaze,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The mountains soft in the sunset haze,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And sleeping forest, and field below,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He said, as he saw the star-like glow</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of lights in the cottage windows far,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"How many God's hidden servants are!"</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>And their mother's golden chain.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then work they found, but for neighbours poor,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Among the women the place contained—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Why was it that she aloof remained?</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Handsome and stately, and strong of arm</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>With five little hungry mouths to fill;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For them she laboured with might and will!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But, proud of spirit, she could not bear</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That other hearts should her burden share.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of soul too high for an evil deed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She scorned the others, but helped their need.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In wit and wisdom the rest excelled,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And yet their kindness too oft repelled;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Accepted nothing, though free to give,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And almost rather had ceased to live</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Than share the loaf from a neighbour's shelf.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yes, proud of her very pride itself!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>She nursed it, cherished it, thought it grand,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To guide unaided her house and land,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And thanked the Lord, when she knelt to pray,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That never one in the place could say,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"I help the widow!"  And now she stood</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Apart from the kneeling multitude,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And half impatient and half amused,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She smiled at the simple words they used,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of praise and wonder, and thought how she</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Could never so weak and childish be!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>For her 't was a proud and happy day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For rest and plenty before her lay:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Herself had sown and herself had reaped;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And now the beautiful sheaves lay heaped,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Not far away, by her open door;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Her heart rejoiced in the ample store!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A neighbour saw her, and called her name:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Come near! perhaps He will do the same</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For thee, and thy summer's work complete;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I know that thou hast not threshed thy wheat!"</span></div>
</div>

<div class="line"><span>She tossed her head with a smile of pride:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"I never yet, since my husband died,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Asked help or favour of any one!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Besides, I saw how the thing was done.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And I can do it as well as He;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He need not turn from His way for me!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She looked on the awed, adoring crowd,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In scorn a moment; then laughed aloud,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To see the horror among them spread,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>At sound of the evil words she said.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Our Lord's disciples, though saints they were,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had no good wishes that day for her!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Indeed, their patience was greatly tried</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To see Him slighted and thrust aside.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>One even whispered, "Hast Thou not heard?"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But He said never an angry word!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>One look of pity He on her cast,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then turned, and forth from the village passed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Along the lane where the grass was brown,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And birds were plucking the thistle-down,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till under the olives' silver screen</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He turned aside, and no more was seen.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="line"><span>And now the widow of heart so proud</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Would show to the grave, indignant crowd</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Her greater wisdom; with this intent</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She calmly in to her fireside went;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Some coals she brought in an iron pan—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"If one can do it, another can!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She said; and then with a careless smile</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She touched the coals to her golden pile.</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>That was the end of the widow's grain!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A few short moments, and nought remained</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of all that her loving toil had gained</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>For the woman was not greatly loved.</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>To think of the slight our Lord received,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>After his wonderful goodness shown,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And when He had made their cares His own!</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Their parents talked on the sin of pride.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To help or comfort her, no one planned,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Except the poorest of all the band;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>An agèd woman, who near her came,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And drew her back from the scorching flame.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Poor soul!" she said, "thou hast children five!</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Her face was white, and her eyes were wild,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Their store of food for the coming year,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Consume before her and disappear!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then came the cry of a little child,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From sleep awakened, in terror wild.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That cry brought life to her fainting heart;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She turned around with a sudden start,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>"Which way did that Blessèd Stranger go?"</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>In such a tumult of angry sound.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She only made with her wrinkled hand</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A sign the widow could understand,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Away on her wild pursuit she flew.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Our Blessèd Lord, with His followers few,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had journeyed on for a mile or two,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When, on the brow of a rocky hill,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The others noticed that He stood still</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And looked behind Him; they did the same.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A woman running toward them came,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Running and stumbling, and falling oft,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And throwing wildly her arms aloft,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As if entreating them still to stay</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till she could finish the toilsome way!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They looked; and pity their souls possessed</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>At first in seeing her thus distressed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But when they knew her, their hearts grew hard,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Nor would they longer her prayers regard.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Good Lord, that woman it is," they say,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Who scorned and slighted Thee so to-day.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She knows her folly, perhaps, too late;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For her, most surely, we should not wait!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"She needs me now!" was His sole reply;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And still He waited—they wondered why!</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Down in the dust at His feet she fell:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Her doleful story she could not tell,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For speech had failed, and she vainly tried:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But, stretching her helpless hands, she cried</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>(With lips that hardly the words could form,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They trembled so with the inward storm),</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Good Lord, have patience, and pity take</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On me, for the innocent children's sake!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And then from her eyes began to pour</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A flood of tears, and she said no more.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She dropped her head on her heaving breast;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But He in His wisdom knew the rest.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And when He looked on her, bowed and crushed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Her pride all broken, her boasting hushed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Take heart!" He said: "I will give thee more</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Still rose where the widow's sheaves had been.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The neighbours lingered, or came and went</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>And, smiling grimly the wreck to view,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Some said: "The widow has had her due!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But more of them shook their heads and sighed,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>For them, at least, there was pitying thought.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>No sin of theirs, if the corn was burned!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And then it was that the Lord returned.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Returned, as ever, to save and bless!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And while the people around Him press,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The widow kneels and the children weep,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He lays His hand on the smouldering heap.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>His touch has the evil work undone;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And in the light of the setting sun</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The corn returned where the ashes lay;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But not as it was at noon that day.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To twice their size had the kernels grown,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And each with a burning lustre shone.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For, since that grain through the fire has passed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T will bear its colour until the last!</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>A few, in seeing the store increased</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of her who seemed to deserve it least,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Began to murmur; and yet, maybe,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Themselves were more in the wrong than she!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With all her folly, with all her sin—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For all her ignorant pride had been</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Far more, alas, than her reason strong,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She never did Him that grievous wrong</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of thinking He could refuse the prayer</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of one who sought Him in her despair;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or that her sin, were it twice as great,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Could close His heart to her woful state;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or lie so heavily on her soul</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But what His love could outweigh the whole!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But most rejoiced in the happy sight</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of evil conquered and wrong made right.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And so from ruin and wreck was born</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The beautiful, flame-hued Indian corn!</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>And there, where he for rest had oft repaired,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>An agèd brother sick and dying lay.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>For years infirm and helpless had he lain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But strong in faith, and happy in God's will,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Through all the weary days and nights of pain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>His only work to suffer and lie still.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>They two were friends, the Patriarch and he,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For oft the busy saint had loved to turn</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From care and work, that peaceful face to see,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And from those patient lips some lesson learn.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And now as he lay dying, glad to go,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet thinking, maybe, of his absent friend,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To him was granted in a dream to know,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of that most holy life, the blessèd end.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>For, sleeping, he beheld in vision clear</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That sombre palace by the poor beloved,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where the good Patriarch, year after year,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had all their burdens lightened or removed.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And down the stairway moved a long array</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of priests and others; slowly did they tread,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A grave procession, as on festal day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he, the Patriarch, was at their head.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The loved companions of his toil were there,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who helped him long to labour and endure,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who knelt beside him in the church at prayer,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or bore his secret bounty to the poor.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>They passed the door where none had knocked in vain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They crossed the courtyard with its well of stone;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But at the outer gate did all remain</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With saddened look, while he went forth alone.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And now the vision changed, he walked no more</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The city street that knew his step so well,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But trod a pleasant path, unknown before,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Through a fair land, where peace did ever dwell.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>There rose the emperor's palace on a hill,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>O'erlooking all the country, where it lay</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Spread out beneath it, beautiful and still,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In all the sweetness of an April day.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Grand was that mansion, stately to behold;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To tell its beauty words can ne'er begin,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The thousand columns, and the domes of gold,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And shining all as from a light within.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He neared the palace—of their own accord</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The lofty gates before him open swing,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And in the glory, as it outward poured,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Came forth the eldest daughter of the King,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Came as he saw her on that far-off night</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Which star-like through his life's long journey shone,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Wearing her olive crown, her robe of light,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And came to meet him, where he walked alone,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He bowed and knelt before her, for he knew</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That presence which had blessed him long before;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While from her folded mantle forth she drew</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A crown of olive, like the one she wore,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And placed it on the saintly silvered head;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then took his hand.  He rose; nor did they wait:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The dreamer watched them as they onward sped,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till, hand in hand, they entered through the gate.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And then, as light concealed them, he awoke,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And to the brethren, gathered in his cell,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In tearful silence listening while he spoke,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He did the story of his vision tell,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And bade them note what hour the dream was sent,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Which some with anxious hearts made haste to do;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then waited, fearing what the vision meant;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till time had shown them all they feared was true.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>For when the dreaded tidings came at last,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They knew that on that very hour and day</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Their much-loved father from this life had passed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In his own isle of Cyprus, far away.</span></div>

<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>In pomp and state, with following great, the Bishop Troilus came</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To the town of Alexandria, which knew him long by fame,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To see the holy Patriarch, who had been his friend of old,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To hear his words of wisdom, and his saintly life behold.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In youth their paths together lay, and both with one accord</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had chosen then the better part, and thought to serve the Lord;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For half a century now and more had each one gone his way.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The Patriarch nearer was to God, far nearer than that day;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For his soul was like a garden where the flowers that then were sown,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With care and patient tending, had to perfect beauty grown.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And Troilus? ... In the world's esteem he stood as high, or higher;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>His piety did all men praise, his eloquence admire;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He had fiery words to thrill them, he had flowery words to please,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And when he preached on festal days, the people swarmed like bees;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From altar steps to open door there was hardly room to stand.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And 't was not the sermon only, but his presence was so grand;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With his grave and agèd beauty, with his form erect and tall,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With saintly face and silver hair, he won the hearts of all.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When through the city he returned, so lofty and serene,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A train of priests attended him, all with obsequious mien;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And children followed open-eyed, and gentle ladies bent</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From balcony and window high to see him as he went.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Indeed he was a stately sight in silken raiment clad,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The ring he wore was valued more than aught the Patriarch had;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the cross upon his bosom, that the people wondering viewed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Gave back the sunshine, when he walked, from jewels many-hued.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And men said his life was blameless, but it still must be confessed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Though the saints were glad to own him, yet the sinners loved him best.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He was rich, and he was famous, and, as all his life had shown,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He was great in worldly wisdom, and the world will love its own.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But while saints and shiners praised him, there was one who did not praise,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But whose eyes forever watched him with a sad and anxious gaze;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the Patriarch, simple-hearted, was not dazzled like the rest,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he knew the deadly passion that the Bishop's soul possessed,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yes, more deadly than another, for it lay so still and cold,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Like a serpent coiled within him,—'twas the growing love of gold.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>It had choked away his pleasure, it had eaten up his peace,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As with every year that left him he had seen his wealth increase,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till his heart grew dry and withered in the smoke of worldly care;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But it dulled him with its poison, and he knew not it was there.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Oh, the Patriarch longed to see him from such cruel bondage free,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he pleaded hard for Troilus every night on bended knee;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For there yet was time to save him, so he hoped and so believed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the days and weeks were passing, and no answer he received.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But with praying he grew bolder, and to combat he began,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he left his door one morning with a wise and hopeful plan;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he said in solemn murmur, as he walked along the way,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"I must go and fight with Satan for my brother's soul to-day;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He is cruel, he is cunning, but his arts will be in vain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The strongest net he ever wove will never bear the strain</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of seeing and of hearing what each day I hear and see,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the Lord has saved my brother if he will but come with me."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>It was in the early morning, long before the noise and heat,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the life was just beginning in the shady city street,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When he saw a church door open, and he turned and entered in.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"I will ask the Lord to help me in this work that I begin."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>There were some who entered near him, and he saw they came in haste,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Toiling men and burdened women, who had little time to waste;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But they stole some precious minutes in that church to kneel and pray,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To refresh their souls and cheer them for the labours of the day;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And they gathered close around him on the pavement, for they felt</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That their prayers would rise the higher if their father with them knelt.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then he said to them: "My children, you must help me now indeed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For my heart and soul are troubled for a friend in sorest need;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He is low with mortal sickness, but no earthly skill can cure.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Pray the Lord to show His mercy to the poorest of the poor."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So they knelt and prayed together, till the morning sun was high,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the Patriarch's heart was kindled, and the time went quickly by.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Troilus too had risen early, and had said his morning prayers,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But he said them somewhat coldly, being filled with other cares.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>At that moment he was thinking, while he counted up his store,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Upon certain silver goblets he had seen the day before,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Which a silversmith had brought him, and had hoped that he would buy.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They were nobly wrought and chiselled, and the price indeed was high,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But he thought upon his table they would look exceeding fine</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When his friends, the rich and noble, should come in with him to dine;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then how all of them would envy, and the thought his spirit cheered,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When a gentle knock aroused him, and the Patriarch appeared.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Very bright his eyes were shining, and his face was all aglow,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But his voice was strange and solemn, when he told him, "I must go</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To the hospital, my brother, and I came here on my way;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>If we both could go together, it would be a happy day.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There I find my greatest blessing, every morning fresh and new,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But far greater, but far sweeter could I share it once with you."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How the heart of Troilus softened, as those eyes upon him shone,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>At their look of earnest pleading, at the tremor in the tone!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Strange it was that look could melt him and that voice could change him so,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Calling back to life, a moment, what had withered long ago,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Some old good that stirred within him, often spurned and thrust aside.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the flowers the Lord had planted, though they dwindled, had not died;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He was poor in heavenly treasure, but he loved the Patriarch still.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"I will come," he answered quickly; "you may lead me where you will."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>There were looks and tones of wonder in the hospital that day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From the rows of low white couches where the sick and dying lay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As, with all his train about him, in his splendour and his pride,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On he walked, the Bishop Troilus, by the simple Patriarch's side.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But erelong the two were parted, for as Troilus looked around,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He recoiled in shrinking horror from each doleful sight and sound;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While the Patriarch loved to linger for a while by every bed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With his strong arms ever ready to sustain a drooping head;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Happy in each humble service, and forgetting all his state,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While he thanked the Lord who sent him on these stricken ones to wait.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How the pale sad faces brightened into smiles as he drew near,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And what loving words were murmured, faintly murmured in his ear!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"Does he well," said Bishop Troilus, as he saw him turn and go</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From one bedside to another, "does he well to stoop so low?"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet had Troilus only known it, they were not the poor alone</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Whom his brother served that morning, but their Master and his own.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There was one but just recovered, light of heart, though poor and weak,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With a journey long before him, going forth his home to seek,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Far away among the mountains where his wife and children stayed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the Patriarch's love had found him ere the stranger sought his aid,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Giving money for the journey, giving blessèd words of cheer.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then he turned, for time was pressing, and a sadder face lay near,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Worn by months of pain and languor; he was young, had once been strong,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He was fading now, but slowly, and perhaps would suffer long,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the hundred wants of sickness who can know that has not proved?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He had wearied all about him, but the Patriarch's heart was moved;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So he heard the long complaining to which no one else gave heed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then he left him, soothed and peaceful, with enough for all his need.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So with one and with another for a moment he would stay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>At each bed he left a blessing, and a blessing brought away,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till his purse grew light and empty, as had happened oft before;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Though he turned it up and shook it, there was not one penny more.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then he turned and sought for Troilus, who that moment, as it chanced,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With a look subdued and solemn, stood and gazed, like one entranced,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On the strange, unearthly beauty, on the light of perfect peace</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In a woman's face before him; she was nearing her release,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And a glory rested on her from the opening door above;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet one shadow marred its splendour when she looked with anxious love</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On a little maid, her daughter, with a pretty, careworn face,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who had brought two younger children, waiting now for her embrace,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Wondering why she did not give it, why so deadly still she lay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For they knew not, though she knew it, she would not live out the day.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Said the Patriarch: "Brother Troilus, have you nothing you could give</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To this woman and her children, for she has not long to live?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And I see her mind is troubled, and I think, before they part,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had she something she could leave them, it would ease her burdened heart;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For myself, I freely promise I will make these babes my care,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But to-day my purse is empty, so I pray you not to spare."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Oh! alas, poor Bishop Troilus! how this pleading broke the spell</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That the woman's look had woven, and how low his spirit fell!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For he dearly loved his money, with a passion deep and blind,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As a scholar loves his learning, or a saint his peace of mind.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the eyes of all were on him at that moment, and he knew</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was in hopeful expectation of what such a saint would do;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There were many who had entered from the busy street to gaze,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He would not be shamed before them, they should still have cause to praise;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But his purse would have to open, so he turned and waved his hand</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To the priest who always bore it, with a gesture of command.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"For this woman for her daughter and the two poor babes," said he,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Lay down thirty golden pieces in the Patriarch's hand for me."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>There were none who had not heard him, for his voice was loud and clear,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And a low, admiring murmur rose from all the couches near,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While the Patriarch stood rejoicing in the deed his friend had done;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>By himself he judged another, and he thought the victory won.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For one moment Bishop Troilus feels his narrow heart expand,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When the maiden thanks him weeping, and the children kiss his hand,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the mother, just departing, from the pillow where she lies,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Turns one happy smile upon him, with a blessing in her eyes.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But alas! on home returning, when the sacrifice was made,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When the Patriarch's holy presence was no longer there to aid,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He did much bewail his money; half in anger, half in pain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To have parted in a moment with what took so long to gain.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And his heart was in a turmoil, and a pain was in his head,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till the raging turned to fever, and he threw him on his bed</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In a storm of angry passion that no reason could control;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For to him to part with money was like parting with his soul.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But he said no word to any of this rage and inward strife,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the priests who waited on him were in terror for his life,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And as nothing made him better, they took counsel, and agreed</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That the Patriarch, and he only, was the man to meet their need;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So they sent and humbly prayed him if to come he would be pleased,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For his friend the Bishop Troilus was with sudden illness seized.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>In his chamber lay the Bishop, sick in body, sick in mind;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the Patriarch, wise in spirit, had his malady divined.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So he came and sat beside him, patient still, but pale with grief,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While he made one last endeavour for that troubled soul's relief.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But his friend was sore and angry, and his words he would not hear,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the presence now disturbed him that had lately been so dear.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he lay with face averted, till he heard the Patriarch say,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"I have brought you back the money that you gave away to-day."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then indeed he started wildly, and his eyes he opened wide,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he turned and faced his brother with a joy he could not hide;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For with sudden hope he trembled, and it paled his fevered cheek;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the Patriarch's heart was sinking, but he still went on to speak:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"When I asked your help this morning, I had nothing of my own,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So I left to you the blessing which had else been mine alone;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For those three dear orphan children I had gladly done the whole,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So their mother up in heaven might be praying for my soul.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And I now have come to ask you if this grace you will resign,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Will you take again the money, and let your good deed be mine?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet I pray you to consider, ere you grant it or refuse,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>What a great and heavenly treasure I shall win and you will lose;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For indeed I would not wrong you, though to me the gain be great.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So then do not answer rashly,—there is time, we both can wait,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And 't were well to think a little on the words our Master said,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How He left the poor behind, that we might serve them in His stead;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And whatever help we grant them, be it great or be it small,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To our blessèd Lord we give it, to our Lord, who gave us all."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then made answer Bishop Troilus, "As for what you now propose,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>If it please you I am ready, and the bargain we can close.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There are many kinds of service, and each needful in its way,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And I think the Lord has set me in His church to preach and pray,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And to save the souls that perish, and to teach men how to live,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While your own vocation, brother, is with open hand to give.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Let not one defraud the other, take your part and leave me mine,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For however we may divide it, all the service is divine.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Let us feed God's flock together, for His needy children care,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I the souls, and you the bodies, so the burden we may share."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Then so be it," said the other, but his voice was low and grave,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he prayed to God in silence for the soul he could not save.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"We must write it all in order, we must sign and seal it too,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So that mine may be the blessing, while the gold remains with you."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>So they wrote a contract solemn, to which each one signed his name,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In which he, the Bishop Troilus, did relinquish every claim</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To whatever reward or merit his one pious deed had earned,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Since the thirty golden pieces to his hand had been returned.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then the Patriarch counted slowly all the pieces, one by one,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In the open hand of Troilus, and his last attempt was done.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>All had failed, and heavy-hearted from that chamber forth he went,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While his friend lay still and smiling in the fullness of content;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the fever now had left him, and 't was sweet to lie and rest,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With no more a thorn to vex him in his smooth, untroubled breast.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With a dreamy satisfaction he was thinking all the while</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How those pretty shining pieces would increase the golden pile</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In that chest of hoarded treasure that already held so much;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he laid his hand upon them with a fond caressing touch.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But his thoughts began to wander, and his eyes were closing soon,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In the drowsy heat and stillness of the summer afternoon.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then a dream was sent to bless him, as in quiet sleep he lay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And it bore him in a vision to the country far away;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he saw the holy city, where the saints and angels dwell;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of its glory, of its beauty, mortal tongue can never tell.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There were palm-trees growing stately by the water, crystal clear;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There was music ever swelling, sometimes far and sometimes near,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As it rose in mystic cadence from the hearts that overflowed</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With the joy that reigns forever in their beautiful abode.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the people of that city whom he met along the way</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On the shining golden pavement, oh, how full of peace were they!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For he thought some heavenly vision shone forever in their sight,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he looked where they were gazing, but he only saw the light</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As it flooded all with glory, and the air it seemed to fill;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But he saw not what they looked on, for his eyes were mortal still.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Now among those lighted faces there were some he knew before,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of the poor to whom so often he had closed his heart and door;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Such as in the heavenly city he had little thought to find,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the sad and sick and needy had been never to his mind:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of the rich were not so many, yet a few of these beside,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who by deeds of love and mercy had their Master glorified.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And in perfect health and beauty, among all that bright array,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was the woman he saw dying in the hospital that day.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>All along the road he travelled, to the left and to the right,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Rose the palaces they dwelt in, each a mansion of delight,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But all varying in their beauty, far away as eye could reach,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With a name in golden letters, high above the door of each.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And sweet faces smiled upon him, from the windows here and there,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Gentle faces free forever from the shade of earthly care;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he heard the happy voices of the children as they played</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In the fair and peaceful gardens, where the roses never fade;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the things he left behind him seemed so very poor and small,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That he wondered, in that glory, why men cared for them at all.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But oh, wonder of all wonders, when he saw a name that shone</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>O'er a high and arching doorway, yes, a name that was his own!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Could it be his eyes deceived him?  No, he read it o'er and o'er;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"This," it said, "of Bishop Troilus is the home forevermore."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Oh the beauty of that palace, with such light and splendour filled,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That he thought the clouds of sunset had been hewn its walls to gild;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the golden door stood open, he could catch a glimpse within</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of the vast illumined chambers where no foot had ever been.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He could only gaze bewildered, for the wonder was too great,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the joy so poured upon him he could hardly bear the weight.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then he took one step toward it, but a servant of the King</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who from far-off earth that morning had returned on busy wing,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And was bearing gifts and tokens from the scattered church below,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Came and passed and stood before him, in the courtyard's golden glow.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then he turned to his companions, for a few had gathered near,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And his words fell hard and heavy on the Bishop's listening ear,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"We must cancel that inscription from the stone, and write thereon</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That Troilus hath this palace sold unto the Patriarch John,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And that thirty golden pieces were the price that he received."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Up then started Bishop Troilus, for his soul was sorely grieved,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he tried to speak, but could not, and awoke in his dismay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With his hand upon the money close beside him where he lay.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Now the long bright day was over; as he saw the sun descend,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Weary day," the Patriarch thought it; he was glad to see it end.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He was walking in his garden where the freshening shadows lay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the flowers that drooped at noontime stood erect in beauty gay;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But their brightness could not cheer him, and he bent his head and sighed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For he thought, with wondering sadness, that the Lord his prayer denied,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then he heard a step behind him, and he looked; but who was there,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Wild of look, like one who struggled with a pain he could not bear?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Could it be the stately Bishop?  Yes, but oh, how changed to see!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he said with tears and trembling, "O my brother, pray for me!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How the Patriarch's heart rebounded from the weight that on it pressed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>At the change so deep and sudden, in those broken words expressed!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How his cheek grew red with gladness, how it smoothed his troubled brow!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"God forgive me if I doubted, all my prayers are answered now."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"Come," he said, "my brother Troilus, sit beside me, tell me all;"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he led him, pale and helpless, to a seat beside the wall.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And there Troilus, clinging closely to that strong and helpful hand,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Trusting in the heart that loved him and his thoughts could understand,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Told the story of his vision to his awed and listening friend,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>All that dream of light and glory, with its sad, unlooked-for end:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But his voice, which trembled ever, wellnigh failed him when he told</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of the horror of that waking, with his hand upon the gold;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When his eyes, long blind, were opened, and he saw the wreck within,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And one fearful moment, showed him what his wasted life had been.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Now," he said, "my courage fails me when I think to mend my ways.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I have wasted all God gave me,—mind, and strength, and length of days,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the gold I gave my soul for pulls me downward with its weight;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Help me if you can, oh, help me!  Say it is not yet too late."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he looked with eyes beseeching at the Patriarch, who replied</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With a smile that fell like sunshine on the faint heart by his side,—</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"What! too late for God's forgiveness, when He calls you to repent?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was to save you, not to lose you, that the blessèd dream was sent;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T is His help, not mine, my brother, you are needing, and you know,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>If we ask it, He will give it, for Himself has told us so.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the prodigal returning shall be welcomed all the more</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>If the years were long and many since he left his Father's door."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"But," said Troilus, "I am agèd, and my manhood's strength is past;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>After such a life ungodly, can I hope for grace at last?"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Never fear," the Patriarch answered, "there is joy in heaven to-day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And they ask not in their gladness if your hair be black or gray."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>So then Troilus gathered courage, and that night, by deed and word,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Gave himself and all his substance to the service of the Lord;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet in his own strength mistrusting, he implored his friend anew</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With his daily prayer to aid him, and he promised so to do.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the thirty golden pieces he returned to him again,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yes, and other thirty with them, for the change was not in vain,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then he left the past behind him, and a better life began;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From that evening in the garden he became another man.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There was no more train about him when he walked the city through,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the priests who once attended now had better work to do;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the ladies cared no longer from their balconies to lean,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When of worldly pomp and splendour there was nothing to be seen.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the cross of many jewels on his bosom shone no more,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Having gone on works of mercy to increase his heavenly store.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the poor and needy sought him; he was now their faithful friend,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And they knew, whatever befell them, on his love they might depend.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>So his closing days were happy, after years of sordid care,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For no gain can bring contentment till the poor have had their share;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he lightened many a burden, and he righted many a wrong,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the wealth became a blessing that had been a curse so long;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And his secret hoard was scattered, and men said that he died poor,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But he found great wealth in heaven at the end, we may be sure.</span></div>

</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>This beautiful legend has for me a most peculiar
interest, owing to the circumstances under which I
first heard it.  It was taught to me by a very dear
young friend whom I had known and loved from his
infancy,—Piero, the only surviving child of Count
Giuseppe Pasolini Zanelli of Faenza.  It was only last
October—eight months ago—and we were all staying
together in the home of his beloved and still beautiful
grandmother, at Bassano, in the Veneto.  It was the
last evening that we expected to pass together, and
Pierino (we had never been able to give up calling him
by that childish diminutive) brought a book with him,
a collection of popular legends compiled by De Gubernatis,
and said that he had a story to read us.  It was
"The Crosses on the Wall," and it has always seemed
to me as though he read it on that particular evening
to prepare us for what was to come.  For some months
he had been not quite so strong as usual, yet no one
felt any particular apprehension, until on the
twenty-eighth of November he died, almost without warning.
He was twenty-two years old, of a very beautiful
character,—so good that we ought to have known he
was not for us.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>With him two great and ancient families come to an
end,—the Pasolini-Zanelli of Faenza, and the
Baroni-Semitecolo of Bassano: these last are the only
descendants of that Semitecolo who worked in mosaic at
Torcello.</span></p>

<div class="line"><span>Grows wild, when it grows at all.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And she grew bitter, as time went on,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Grew bitter and hard and sore.</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>"I can bear my life no more!</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"Look down from Heaven, good Lord, and see</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>To her cry for help an answer came,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And solemn it was, and strange!</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>And the place seemed all to change.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>She stood in a sad and sombre room,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where from ceiling down to floor,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Along the wall and on every side,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There were crosses—nothing more.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>There were crosses old, and crosses new,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There were crosses large and small;</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>As the Master of them all.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Before His presence her eyes dropped low,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Was greater than all beside.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And He bade her choose, and take away,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From among the many there,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Another cross, in exchange for hers,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That she found too great to bear.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>She looked for those that were least in size,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she quickly lifted one;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But oh, 't was heavy, and pained her more</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Than her own had ever done!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>She laid it back with a trembling hand—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"And whose cross is that?" she cried;</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>And a solemn voice replied:</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"That cross belongs to a maiden young,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But of youth she little knows;</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>And the night brings scant repose.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"A helpless, suffering, useless thing!</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>It fell from her hand against the wall,</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The widow thought of her own wild brood,</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"Oh, give me patience, for life is hard;</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>She kept her word as the weeks went on,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Their love, that long she had claimed in vain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Came back to her all unsought.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>With love for teacher, they learned to help,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There was work for fingers small:</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Her girls so pretty, her boys so brave,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Little children, will you listen to a simple tale of mine,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That I learned at San Marcello, in the Tuscan Apennine,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From an agèd, saintly woman, gone to heaven long ago?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It has helped me on my journey, and as yet you cannot know</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Half the wisdom stored within it, nor the comfort it can give;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But still, try and not forget it!  You will need it if you live,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And some day, when life is waning and your hands begin to tire,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>You will think of Marianna, and her vision by the fire.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>In a convent, old and quiet, near a little country town,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On a chestnut-shaded hillside, to the river sloping down,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Dwelt a few of those good sisters who go out among the poor,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who must labour late and early, and much weariness endure;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the one who did in patience and in all good works excel</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was the Sister Marianna, she whose story now I tell.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>She was ever kind and willing, for each heavy task prepared:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>No one ever thought to spare her, and herself she never spared.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>All unpraised and all unnoticed, bearing burdens not her own,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet she lived as rich and happy as a queen upon her throne!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>She was rich, though few would think it; for God gave her grace to choose,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Not the world's deceitful riches, but the wealth one cannot lose.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There are many heap up treasure, but it is not every one</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who will take his treasure with him when his earthly life is done.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Was she beautiful?  I know not.  She had eyes of peaceful light,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And her face looked sweet and blooming in its frame of linen white.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To the sick and heavy-hearted she was pleasant to behold,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she seemed a heavenly vision to the feeble and the old.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She was happy when she wandered up the wandering mountain road,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Bearing food and warmth and blessing to some desolate abode,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Though the ice-cold winds were blowing and her woman's strength was tried;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For she knew who walked there with her, in her heart and by her side.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She was happy—oh, so happy!—in her little whitewashed cell</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Looking out among the branches, where they gave her leave to dwell</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In her scanty hours of leisure; for there, looking from the wall,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Were the dear and holy faces that she loved the best of all.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>'T was an old and faded picture, poorly painted at the best,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of Our Lord, the Holy Infant, in His Mother's arms at rest.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But her faith and loving fancy had a glory to it lent,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the faces that she saw there were not what the artist meant</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the wooden shelf before it she would often-times adorn</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With the buttercup and bluebell, and the wild rose from the thorn,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Which she gathered, when returning, while the morning dew was bright,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From some home, remote and lonely, where she watched the sick by night.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So her life was full of sunshine, for in toiling for the Lord</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She had found the hidden sweetness that in common things lies stored:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He has strewn the earth with flowers, and each eye their brightness sees;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But He filled their cups with honey, for His humble working bees.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But there came a time—poor sister!—when her rosy cheek grew pale,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And her eyes, with all their sunlight, seemed to smile as through a veil;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And her step was weak and heavy, as she trod the steep ascent,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where through weeks of wintry weather to her loving work she went.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was a foot-path, lone and narrow, winding up among the trees,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And 't was hard to trace in winter, when the slippery ground would freeze,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the snow fall thick above it, hiding every sign and mark;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But she went that way so often she could climb it in the dark!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was to nurse a poor young mother, by fierce malady assailed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That she made the daily journey, and she never once had failed.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Now the short sharp days were over, and the spring had just begun;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Every morn the light came sooner, and more strength was in the sun.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>All around the grass was springing, and its tender verdure spread,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Mid the empty burrs of chestnuts, and the old leaves, brown and dead,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Low and small, but creeping, creeping till it almost touched the edge</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of the daily lessening snow-drifts, under rock or thorny hedge.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From the wreck of last year's autumn life awakened, strong and new,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the buds were crowding upward, though as yet the flowers were few.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Many nights had she been watching, and with little rest by day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For her heart was in the chamber where that helpless woman lay;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There the flame of life she cherished, when it almost ceased to burn,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Praying God to help and keep them till the husband should return.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>'T was the old and common story, such as all of us can hear,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>If we care to, in the mountains, every day throughout the year!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She who languished, weak and wasting, in the garret chamber there,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had been once as strong and happy as the wild birds in the air.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She had been a country beauty, for the boys to serenade;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the poets sang about her, in the simple rhymes they made,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And with glowing words compared her to the lilies as they grew,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or to stars, or budding roses, as their manner is to do.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then the man who played at weddings with his ancient violin,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With his sad, impassioned singing, had contrived her heart to win;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And one brilliant April morning he had brought her home, a bride,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To his farm and low-built cottage on the mountain's terraced side.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was a poor, rough home to look at, and from neighbours far away,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But with love and health and music there was much to make it gay.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They were happy, careless people, and they thought not to complain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Though the door were cracked and broken, or the roof let in the rain:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They could pile the fire with branches, while the winter storms swept by;</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>For the rest, their life was mostly out beneath the open sky.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Time had come, and brought its changes,—sunshine first, and then the shade,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Frost untimely, chestnuts blighted.  Sickness came, and debts were made;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Fields were sold, alas, to pay them; yet their troubles did not cease,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the poor man's heart was troubled thus to see his land decrease!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Fields were gone, and bread was wanting, for there now were children small;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Much he loved them, much he laboured—but he could not feed them all.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>So he left them, heavy-hearted, and his fortune went to try</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In the low Maremma country, where men gain or where they die,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With its soft and treacherous beauty, with its fever-laden air;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But as yet the fever spared him, and they hoped it yet would spare.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was a long and cruel winter in the home he left behind:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Lonely felt the house without him, and the young wife moped and pined:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Still her children's love sustained her, till this sickness laid her low;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When good Sister Marianna came to nurse her, as you know.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Week on week had hope been waning, as more feeble still she grew:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Marianna tried, but vainly, every simple cure she knew.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then the doctor gave up hoping, and his long attendance ceased:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"I can do no more," he told her; "you had better call the priest.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To her husband I have written; he will have the news to-day:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>If he cares again to see her, he had best be on his way!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Now the priest has done his office; at the open door he stands,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he says to Marianna: "I can leave her in your hands,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I have other work that calls me; if to-night she chance to die,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>You can say the prayers, good sister, for her soul as well as I."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>So they left her, all unaided, in the house forlorn and sad,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Still to watch and think and labour with what failing strength she had.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There was none to share her burden, none to speak to, none to see—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Save a helpful boy of seven, and a restless one of three,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And their little dark-eyed sister (she was five, and came between),</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And a baby, born that winter, which the father had not seen.</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Two days more!  Her friend lay sleeping, and she watched beside the bed:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In her arms she rocked the baby, while the Latin prayers she said,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Prayers to help a soul departing;—yet she never quite despaired!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Might not yet the Lord have pity, and that mother's life be spared?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was so hard to see her going—such a mother, kind and dear!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There was ne'er another like her in the country, far or near!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>(So thought Sister Marianna.)  Yet to murmur were a sin.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But her tears kept rising, rising, though she tried to hold them in,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till one fell and lay there shining, on the head that she caressed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Small and pretty, dark and downy, lying warm against her breast,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She was silent; something moved her that had neither place nor part</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In the grave and stately cadence of the prayers she knew by heart.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then she spoke, with eyes dilated, with her soul in every word,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As to one she saw before her—"Thou hast been a child, my Lord!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Thou hast lain as small and speechless as this infant on my knees;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Thou hast stretched toward Thy Mother little helpless hands like these:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Thou hast known the wants of children, then—  Oh, listen to my plea,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For one moment, Lord, remember what Thy Mother was to Thee!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Think, when all was dark around Thee how her love did Thee enfold;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How she tended, how she watched Thee; how she wrapped Thee from the cold!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How her gentle heart was beating, on that night of tears and strife,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When the cruel guards pursued Thee, when King Herod sought Thy life!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How her arms enclosed and hid Thee, through that midnight journey wild!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Oh, for love of Thine own Mother, save the mother of this child!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Now she paused and waited breathless; for she seemed to know and feel</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That the Lord was there, and listened to her passionate appeal.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then she bowed her head, all trembling; but a light was in her eye,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For her soul had heard the answer: that young mother would not die!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yes, the prayer of faith had saved her!  And a change began that day:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When she woke her breath was easy, and the pain had passed away.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So the day that dawned so sadly had a bright and hopeful close,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And a solemn, sweet thanksgiving from the sister's heart arose.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Now the night had closed around them, and a lonesome night it seemed!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the sky was black and starless, and for hours the rain had streamed:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the wind and rain together made a wild and mournful din,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As they beat on door and window, madly struggling to come in.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Marianna, faint and weary with the strain of many days,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On the broad stone hearth was kneeling, while she set the fire ablaze,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the poor lone soul she cared for would, ere morning, need to eat.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Now, God help me," said the sister, "this night's labour to complete!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was a meal she knew would please her, which she lovingly prepared,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of that best and chosen portion, from the convent table spared,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Which she brought, as was her habit, with much other needed store,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In the worn old willow basket, standing near her on the floor.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>On her work was much depending, so she planned to do her best;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she set the earthen pitcher on the coals as in a nest,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With the embers laid around it; then she thought again, and cast</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On the pile a few gray ashes, that it might not boil too fast.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the touch of sleep was on her, she was dreaming while she planned,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the wooden spoon kept falling from her limp and listless hand.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then she roused her, struggling bravely with this languor, which she viewed</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As a snare, a sore temptation, to be fought with and subdued.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But another fear assailed her—what if she should faint or fall?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And to-night the storm-swept cottage seems so far away from all!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How the fitful wind is moaning!  And between the gusts that blow,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She can hear the torrent roaring, in the deep ravine below.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And her head is aching strangely, as it never did before:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Good Lord, help me!" she is saying: "this can last but little more!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>O my blessèd Lord and Master, only help me through the night—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Only keep my eyes from closing till they see the morning light!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For that mother and that baby do so weak and helpless lie,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And with only me to serve them,—if I leave them, they may die!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She is better—yes, I know it, but a touch may turn the scale.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>I can send for help to-morrow, but to-night I must not fail!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was in vain; for sleep had conquered, and the words she tried to say</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>First became a drowsy murmur, then grew faint and died away.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she slept as sleep the weary, heedless how the night went on,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With her pitcher all untended, with her labour all undone;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On the wall her head reclining, in the chimney's empty space,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While the firelight flared and flickered on her pale and peaceful face.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was her humble prayer unanswered?  Oh, the Lord has many a way</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That His children little think of, to send answers when they pray!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It was long she sat there sleeping—do you think her work was spoiled?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>No, the fir-wood fire kept burning, and the pitcher gently boiled:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Ne'er a taint of smoke had touched it, nor one precious drop been spilt;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When she moved and looked around her, with a sudden sense of guilt.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But her eyes, when first they opened, saw a vision, strange and sweet,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For a little Child was standing on the hearth-stone at her feet.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And He seemed no earthly infant, for His robe was like the snow,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And a glory shone about Him that was not the firelight glow.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And Himself her work was doing!  For He kept the fire alive,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And He watched the earthen pitcher, that no danger might arrive</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To the simple meal, now ready, with the coals around it piled;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then He turned His face toward her, and she knew the Holy Child.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was her Lord who stood before her!  And she did not shrink nor start—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There was more of joy than wonder in her all-believing heart.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When her willing hands were weary, when her patient eyes were closed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He had finished all she failed in, He had watched while she reposed.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Do you ask of His appearance?  Human words are weak and cold;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T is enough to say she knew Him—that is all she ever told.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yes, as you and I will know Him when that happy day shall come,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When, if we on earth have loved Him, He will bid us welcome home!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But with that one look He left her, and the vision all had passed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>(Though the peace it left within her to her dying hour would last!)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Storm had ceased, and wind was silent, there was no more sound of rain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the morning star was shining through the window's broken pane.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Later, when the sun was rising, Marianna looked to see,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>O'er the stretch of rain-washed country, what the day was like to be,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While the door she softly opened, letting in the morning breeze,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As it shook the drops by thousands from the wet and shining trees.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she saw the sky like crystal, for the clouds had rolled away,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Though they lay along the valleys, in their folds of misty grey,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or to mountain sides were clinging, tattered relics of the storm.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And among the trees below her she could see a moving form;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was the husband home returning, yes, thank God! he came at last:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There was no one else would hasten up that mountain road so fast.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Now the drooping boughs concealed him, now he came in sight again;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>All night long had he been walking in the darkness, in the rain;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Through the miles of ghostly forest, through the villages asleep,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He had borne his burden bravely, till he reached that hillside steep;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And as yet he seemed not weary, for his springing step was light,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But his face looked worn and haggard with the anguish of the night.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Now his limbs began to tremble, and he walked with laboured breath,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For he saw his home before him, should he find there life or death?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How his heart grew faint within him as he neared the wished-for place!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>One step more, his feet had gained it, they were standing face to face.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"God has helped us!" was her answer to the question in his eye;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And her smile of comfort told him that the danger had gone by.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>It was morning now, fair morning! and the broken sunlight fell</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Through the boughs that crossed above her, where the buds began to swell,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As adown the sloping pathway, that her feet so oft had pressed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Went the Sister Marianna to her convent home to rest.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It was spring that breathed around her, for the winter strove no more,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the snowdrifts all had vanished with the rain the night before.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Now a bee would flit beside her, as she lightly moved along;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or a bird among the branches tried a few low notes of song.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But her heart had music sweeter than the bird-notes in her ears!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She was leaving joy behind her in that home of many tears:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Hope was there, and health returning; there were happy voice and smile,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the father at his coming had brought plenty for a while.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she knew with whom she left them, for herself His care had proved,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When her mortal eyes were opened, and she saw the face she loved,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On that night of storm and trouble, when to help her He had come,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As He helped His own dear Mother in their humble earthly home.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>As she went the day grew warmer; sweeter came the wild bird's call;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then, what made her start and linger?  'T was a perfume, that was all:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Faint, but yet enough to tell her that the violets were in bloom;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she turned aside to seek them, for that picture in her room.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Through the streets of old Siena, at the dawning of the day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Went the holy Caterina, as the bells began to sound;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With the light of peace celestial in her eyes of olive gray,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For her soul was with the angels, while her feet were on the ground.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>She was fair as any lily, with as delicate a grace;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the air of early morning had just tinged her cheek with rose:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet one hardly thought of beauty in that pale, illumined face,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That the souls in trouble turned to, finding comfort and repose.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And the men their heads uncovered, though they dared not speak her praise,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When they saw her like a vision down the row street descend;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And they wondered what she looked at, with that far-off dreamy gaze,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While her lips were often moving, as though talking to a friend.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>There were few abroad so early, and she scarcely heard a sound,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Save the cooing of the pigeons, as about her feet they strayed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or the bell that sweetly called her to the church where she was bound;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While the palaces around her stood in silence and in shade.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And the towers built for warfare rose about her, dark and proud,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But their summits caught a glory, as the morning onward came,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the summer sky beyond them was alight with fleecy cloud,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where the gray of dawn was changing, first to rose and then to flame.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>By a shrine of the Madonna, at a corner where she passed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Stood a stranger leaning on it, as though weary and forlorn,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With a bundle slung behind him and a cloak about him cast;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For he shivered in the freshness of the pleasant summer morn.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Said the stranger, "Will you help me?" and she looked on him and knew,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>By his hand that trembled feebly as he held it out for aid,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>By his eyes that were so heavy, and his lips of ashen hue,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That the terrible Maremma had its curse upon him laid.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>So she listened to his story, that was pitiful to hear,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of a widowed mother waiting on the mountain for her son;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>How to help her he had laboured till the summer time drew near,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And of how the fever took him just before his work was done.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He was young and he was hopeful, and the smile began to come</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In his eyes, as though they thanked her for the pity she bestowed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he said: "I shall recover if I reach my mountain home,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And if some good Christian people will but help me on the road.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"For I go to Casentino, where the air is pure and fine,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But my strength too often fails me, and the place is far away;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So I pray you give me something, for a little bread and wine,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That I may not set out fasting on my weary walk to-day."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then a certain faint confusion with her pity seemed to blend,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And her face, so sweet and saintly, showed the shadow of a cloud,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As she said: "I am no lady, though you call me so, my friend,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But a poor Domenicana who to poverty am vowed.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"I can give a prayer to help you on your journey, nothing more,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For these garments I am wearing are the sisterhood's, not mine,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the very bread they gave me when I left the convent door</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To a beggar by the wayside I this morning did consign.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"I would give you all you ask for if I had it to command."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then she sighed and would have left him, but the stranger made her stay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For he held her by the mantle, with his cold and wasted hand:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"For the love of Christ, my lady, do not send me thus away!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He had used the name unthinking, but it moved her none the less,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she turned again toward him, with a softened, solemn air,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While her hand began to wander up and down her simple dress,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As though vaguely it were seeking for some trifle she could spare.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then the rosary she lifted that was hanging at her waist,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And its silver cross unfastened, which was small and very old,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With the edges worn and rounded and the image half effaced,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet she loved it more than lady ever loved a cross of gold.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>It had been her life companion, in the tempest, in the calm;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>She had held it to her bosom when she prayed with troubled mind;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she kissed it very gently, as she laid it in his palm,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"For the love of Christ, then, take it; 'tis the only thing I find."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>So he thanked her and departed, and she thought of him no more,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Save to ask the Lord to help him, when that day in church she prayed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the cross of Caterina on his heart the stranger wore,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And her presence unforgotten like a blessing with him stayed.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Now the city life is stirring, and the streets are in the sun,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the bells ring out their music o'er the busy town again,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As the people slowly scatter from the church where Mass is done;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the blessèd Caterina in her seat did still remain.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>For the sleep divine was on her, which so often to her came,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When of mortal life the shadow from around her seemed to fall;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she looked on things celestial with her happy soul aflame:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But that day the dream that held her was the sweetest of them all.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>For the Lord appeared in glory, and he seemed to her to stand</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In a chamber filled with treasures such as eye had never seen;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And a cross of wondrous beauty He was holding in His hand,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Set with every stone most precious and with pearls of light serene.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And He told her that those treasures were the presents He received</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From the souls on earth who love Him, and are seeking Him to please.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Were they deeds of noble service? that was what she first believed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And she thought, "What happy people who can bring Him gifts like these!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>For herself could offer nothing, and she sighed to think how far</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From the best she ever gave him were the gems in that bright store.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But He held the cross toward her, that was shining like a star,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And He bade her look and tell Him had she seen it e'er before.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"No," she answered humbly, "never did my eyes the like behold."</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But a flood of sudden sweetness came upon her like a wave,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For she saw among the jewels and the work of beaten gold</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was the little Cross of Silver that for love of Christ she gave.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And I think her dream that morning was a message from above,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That a proof of deepest meaning we might learn and understand,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Though our very best be worthless that we give for Jesus' love,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It will change and turn to glory when He takes it in His hand.</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Where, after parley and long delay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had the meeting been combined.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>No sound but their feet that crushed the snow,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the world looked sad and dead;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They thought of lives on the mountain lost,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And it was not much they said.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The sun, as it shone with slanting ray</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Through the stripped and silent trees,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Could melt but little the clinging ice</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Which to-night again would freeze.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>They reached the grove, and the chief was there,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Like a king in savage state;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Erect and fearless, above them all,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While his men around him wait.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He stood before them like what he was,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A terrible beast of prey;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But even tigers have something grand,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he looked as grand as they.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But, oh, the look that he on them turned!</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It was fearful to behold;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It chilled their hearts, but they did not shrink,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For their faith had made them bold.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And looking straight in those gloomy eyes,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With their hard and cruel glare,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"We come," said one, "in the Emperor's name,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And from him a token bear."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then said the chief, with a mocking smile,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"And what may my Lord command?"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And made a sign with his evil eye,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the men on guard to stand.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>No faith had he in a tale so wild,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he somewhat feared a snare;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There might be others in hiding near,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But he did not greatly care.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then forth came he who the relics bore,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was a prudent man and brave,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And into the hand that all men feared,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He the holy token gave.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"This gift to you has the Emperor sent,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In token of his good will,"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He said; and at first the fierce brigand</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Stood in wonder, hushed and still.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>What felt he then as that holy thing</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In his guilty hand he took?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>What changed his face for a moment's time</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To an almost human look?</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>There lay the shrine in his open palm.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet he thought it could not be:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"For me?" he asked, but his voice was strange.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And again he said, "for me?"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Three times the messenger told his tale,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he said 't was all he knew;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The bandit looked at the wondrous work,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he could not doubt 't was true.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>So over his neck the chain he hung,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The shrine on his bosom lay</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With all its wealth of a thousand prayers;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And they were not cast away.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Day followed day in the bandit's cave,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And a restless man was he;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A heart so hard and so proud as his</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With the saints could ill agree.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The holy relics that on it lay</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Did a strange confusion make;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In all that most he had loved before,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He could no more pleasure take.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>A charm there was in the golden shrine</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That had all his soul possessed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He sat and looked at each sacred sign</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With a dreamy sense of rest.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>'T was not the gold that could soothe him thus,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And 't was not the work so fine:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was the holy soul of the artist monk,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For it lived in every line.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Like one who sleeps when the day begins,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And, before his slumbers end,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The morning light and the morning sounds</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With his dreaming fancies blend;</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>So now and then would his heart be stirred</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>By a feeling strange and new,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And thoughts he never had known before</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In his mind unconscious grew.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Till on a sudden his blinding pride,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Like a bubble, failed and broke;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With eyes wide open, the guilty man</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From his life-long dream awoke.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>From graves forgotten his crimes came forth,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In his face they seemed to stare:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To all one day will such waking come;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>God grant it be here, not there.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then wild remorse on his heart took hold,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And beneath its burning sting</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He shrank from himself as one might shrink</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From a venomous, hateful thing.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>For scenes of blood from the years gone by</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Forever before him came;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He closed his eyes, and his face he hid,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But he saw them just the same.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And in the horror he dared not pray,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For he felt his soul accurst,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he feared to live, and he feared to die,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he knew not which was worst.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Yet far on high, and beyond his reach,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He could see a vision dim,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A far-off glory of peace and love;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But he felt 't was not for him.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Awhile his trouble he hid from all,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For his will was iron strong,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But never was man, since man was made,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who could bear such torment long,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>A strange, sick longing was growing up</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In his spirit, day by day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A longing for what he most had feared,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To let justice have her way;</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Until the will to a purpose grew,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To the Emperor's feet to fly,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To own his sin without prayer or plea,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And then give up all and die.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And so one night, without sound or word,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Away in the dark he stole,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And all that he took for his journey long</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was the weight of a burdened soul.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>They waited long in that den of crime,</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And in the country, so long oppressed,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>When the fiends had claimed their own.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And soon the tale to a legend turned,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And men trembling used to tell</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of how they carried him, body and soul,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To the place where demons dwell.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>His men, so bold, were in mortal fear</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of what might themselves befall;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So some in a convent refuge sought,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the rest were scattered all.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And no one climbed to their empty cave,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Of its horror every trace,</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And mountain strawberries nestled low,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>Where the swallows reared their young.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But where had he gone, that man of woe?</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>As his bandit life had taught.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And going downward he met the spring,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>And he did not see the flowers.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And how did he live from day to day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the ceaseless strain endure?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Kind hearts there are that can feel for all,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>That his saddening shadow fell.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>A fever slowly within him burned,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till the springs of life were dry,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And glad he was when they laid him down</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On a hospital bed to die.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>His heart was broken, his strength was gone,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He had no more wish to live;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He almost hoped that the Lord on high,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Like the Emperor, might forgive;</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>That somewhere down in the peaceful earth</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He should find a refuge yet,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A place to rest and his eyes to close,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the woful past forget.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He could not lie where the others lay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For such gloom around him spread,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That soon in a chamber far away</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Had they set his friendless bed.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>'T was there he suffered and wept and prayed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From the eyes of all concealed:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Alas! but it takes a weary time</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For a life like his to yield.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The grand old hospital where he died</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was beneath the watchful care</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of a certain doctor, famed afar</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For his skill and learning rare.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But more than learning and more than skill</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was his heart, so large and kind,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That knew the trouble and felt the needs</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of the sick who near him pined.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>With conscience pure had he served the Lord</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From youth till his hair was grey,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Yet only pity he felt, not scorn,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the many feet that stray.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>In troubled scenes had his life been passed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He was used to woe and sin,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And when men suffered he did not ask</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>If their lives had blameless been.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>His part was but to relieve their pain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he helped and soothed and cheered;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But most he cared for the stricken man</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Whom the others shunned and feared.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Each art to save him he tried in vain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And it could but useless prove,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For the poisoned thorn that pierced his heart</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Could no earthly hand remove,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>When hope had failed, he would kneel and pray,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And his heart with tears outpour,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That God in mercy would comfort send</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To that soul in torment sore.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And though the burden he might not lift,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He could help its weight to bear;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He talked of mercy, of peace to come,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he bade him not despair.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And so, on the last sad night of all,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was the brave, good doctor came</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To watch alone by the bandit's side,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When he died of grief and shame.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The spring to summer was wearing on,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was the fairest night in May,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When sleep to those eyes in mercy came,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the deadly strain gave way.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>No candle burned, for the moon was full,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the peaceful splendour fell</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Through the open window, lighting all:</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It was like a kind farewell.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And scents from the garden floated in,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the silent fireflies came,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And breathed and vanished, and breathed again,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With their soft mysterious flame.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The doctor watched with a heavy heart,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>His head on his hand was bowed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He thought how many his prayers had been,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But they could not lift the cloud.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>'T was over now, there was nothing left</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For his pitying love to do;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The worn-out body would rest at last,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the guilty soul,—who knew?</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>No more to do but to watch and wait</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till the failing breath should cease;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He longed, as the counted minutes flew,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For one parting smile of peace.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He looked: a handkerchief veiled the eyes,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For they wept until the end,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And sadly still on the wasted cheek</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Did a few slow drops descend.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The peace that oft to the dying comes</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Was to him as yet denied,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>No sunset clear after stormy day,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And no brightening ere he died.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"Alas! he will go away to-night,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And without one hopeful sign,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Away from pity, away from care,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And from such poor help as mine!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The doctor sighed, but he hoped as well,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For he said, "It cannot be</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That the Lord, who died for all, will have</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>No mercy for such as he."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>'T was then that sleep on the doctor fell,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And before him stood revealed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In dreaming vision, a wondrous sight,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From his waking eyes concealed.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>For other watchers were in the room,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he knew the ghastly throng</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of demon spirits, the very same</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Whom the man had served so long.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And two were leaning across the bed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And another pressed behind,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And some in the shadow waiting stood,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With a chain his soul to bind.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But angels watched by the bedside too;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was a strange and solemn scene,—</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The angels here and the demons there,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the dying man between.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The angels looked with a troubled gaze</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On the face consumed with grief,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And over the pillow bent and swayed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As in haste to bring relief.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And one on the bowed and burdened head</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Did a hand in blessing lay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he said, "Poor soul, come home with us.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where the tears are wiped away."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"Not so," cried one of the demon troop,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"He is black with every sin;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And you may not touch our lawful prey</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That we laboured years to win.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"We bought his soul, and the price we paid,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And our part has well been done;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We helped him ever from crime to crime,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till his buried wealth was won;</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"And we almost thought him one of us,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He had so well learned our ways;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So go, for we do but seek our own,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And be done with these delays."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The angel said, "He has wept his sin,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As none ever wept before,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Has mourned till his very life gave way,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And what could a man do more?</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"And our Blessèd Lord, who pities all,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the sins of all has borne,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Will never His mercy turn away</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From a heart so bruised and torn."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"But how? and shall mercy be for him</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who has mercy never shown?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Can his sorrow bring the dead to life,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Or can tears for blood atone?</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"Is he to rest with the angels now,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Has he done with tears and pain?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To-morrow morn he will wish he lay</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On the hospital bed again;</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"There is somewhat more to weep for down</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In the place where he must stay!"</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The demon looked at his fiendish mates;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he laughed, and so did they.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And they gathered close, like hungry wolves,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In their haste to rend and tear;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But they could not touch the helpless head</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>While that strong white hand was there.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then out of the shadow one came forth,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>'T was a demon great and tall;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>An iron balance he held on high,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As he stood before them all.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And fiercely he to the angels called,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"Do you dare to claim him still?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Then come, for the scales are in my hand,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>We will weigh the good and ill."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And into the nearest scale he threw,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As he spoke, a parchment roll,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With on it a note of every sin</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That had stained the parting soul.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>'T was closely written, without, within,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the balance downward flew</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And struck the ground with a blow, as though</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It would break the pavement through.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"He is ours forever," the demons said,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>"If justice the world controls;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>For sins so heavy do on him lie,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They would sink a hundred souls!</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"Come, hasten, angels, the time is short,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And words are of no avail;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Come, bring the note of your friend's good deeds,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To lay in the empty scale."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The angels searched, but they searched in vain,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There was no good deed to bring;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In all that ever that hand had done,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They could find no worthy thing.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>A taunting shout from the demons broke,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And each hard malignant face</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With joy and triumph was all aflame;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But the angels held their place,</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Though dimness fell like a passing cloud</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>On their pure and holy light;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And if ever angel eyes have tears,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>There were some in theirs that night.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But he who had been the first to speak,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With a glimmering hope possessed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Still sought some good that would turn the scale,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Though it seemed a useless quest.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He saw the handkerchief where it lay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he raised it off the bed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>All wet and clinging, and steeped in tears</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That the dying eyes had shed.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He turned around, but his face was pale,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As the last poor chance he tried;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He laid it down in the empty scale,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he said, "Let God decide!"</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>When, lo! it fell till it touched the earth,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And the demons stood dismayed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>It seemed so little and light a thing,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But it all his sins outweighed.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>But who shall ever the anger tell</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of that black and hateful band,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>When most in triumph they felt secure,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The prey had escaped their hand.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>They stood one moment in speechless rage,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And then, with a fearful sound</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of shrieks and curses and rattling chains,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They vanished beneath the ground.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then holy peace on the chamber fell,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Till it flooded all the air;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The angels praised and they thanked the Lord,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Who so late had heard their prayer.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And their clouded glory shone again,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>With a clear celestial ray,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>As the trembling soul, which that moment passed,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>They bore in their arms away.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then through the room, as they took their flight,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Did a flood of music stream,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So loud, so sweet, and so close at hand,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That it waked him from his dream.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>He looked around; there was nothing stirred</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>In the empty, moonlit room,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Where a faint, sweet odour filled the air</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From the orange-trees in bloom.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>And the notes divine he had thought to hear</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Were only the liquid flow</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Of a nightingale's song, that came up clear</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From the garden just below.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>Then up from his seat the doctor rose,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he stood beside the bed;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>He knew, when he touched the quiet hand,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That the poor brigand was dead.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>The handkerchief on the pillow lay,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>But its weary use was o'er,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And he raised it, heavy and wet with tears,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>From the eyes that could weep no more.</span></div>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit </span><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</span></p>

Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Corrected </span><em class="italics">editions</em><span> of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
