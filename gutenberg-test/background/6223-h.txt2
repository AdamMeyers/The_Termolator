      I
    
    
      "Ask Mr. Hume to come here for a moment, Gosse," said Field, the chief
      factor, as he turned from the frosty window of his office at Fort
      Providence, one of the Hudson's Bay Company's posts. The servant, or more
      properly, Orderly-Sergeant Gosse, late of the Scots Guards, departed on
      his errand, glancing curiously at his master's face as he did so. The
      chief factor, as he turned round, unclasped his hands from behind him,
      took a few steps forward, then standing still in the centre of the room,
      read carefully through a letter which he had held in the fingers of his
      right hand for the last ten minutes as he scanned the wastes of snow
      stretching away beyond Great Slave Lake to the arctic circle. He meditated
      a moment, went back to the window, looked out again, shook his head
      negatively, and with a sigh, walked over to the huge fireplace. He stood
      thoughtfully considering the floor until the door opened and sub-factor
      Jaspar Hume entered.
    
    
      The factor looked up and said: "Hume, I've something here that's been
      worrying me a bit. This letter came in the monthly batch this morning. It
      is from a woman. The company sends another commending the cause of the
      woman and urging us to do all that is possible to meet her wishes. It
      seems that her husband is a civil engineer of considerable fame. He had a
      commission to explore the Coppermine region and a portion of the Barren
      Grounds. He was to be gone six months. He has been gone a year. He left
      Fort Good Hope, skirted Great Bear Lake, and reached the Coppermine River.
      Then he sent back all of the Indians who accompanied him but two, they
      bearing the message that he would make the Great Fish River and come down
      by Great Slave Lake to Fort Providence. That was nine months ago. He has
      not come here, nor to any other of the forts, so far as is known, nor has
      any word been received from him. His wife, backed by the H.B.C., urges
      that a relief party be sent to look for him. They and she forget that this
      is the arctic region, and that the task is a well-nigh hopeless one. He
      ought to have been here six months ago. Now how can we do anything? Our
      fort is small, and there is always danger of trouble with the Indians. We
      can't force men to join a relief party like this, and who will volunteer?
      Who would lead such a party and who will make up the party to be led?"
    
    
      The brown face of Jaspar Hume was not mobile. It changed in expression but
      seldom; it preserved a steady and satisfying character of intelligence and
      force. The eyes, however, were of an inquiring, debating kind, that moved
      from one thing to another as if to get a sense of balance before opinion
      or judgment was expressed. The face had remained impassive, but the eyes
      had kindled a little as the factor talked. To the factor's despairing
      question there was not an immediate reply. The eyes were debating. But
      they suddenly steadied and Jaspar Hume said sententiously: "A relief party
      should go."
    
    
      "Yes, yes, but who is to lead them?"
    
    
      Again the eyes debated.
    
    
      "Read her letter," said the factor, handing it over. Jaspar Hume took it
      and mechanically scanned it. The factor had moved towards the table for
      his pipe or he would have seen the other start, and his nostrils slightly
      quiver, as his eyes grew conscious of what they were seeing. Turning
      quickly, Hume walked towards the window as though for more light, and with
      his back to the factor he read the letter. Then he turned and said: "I
      think this thing should be done."
    
    
      The factor shrugged his shoulders slightly. "Well, as to that, I think so
      too, but thinking and doing are two different things, Hume."
    
    
      "Will you leave the matter in my hands until the morning?"
    
    
      "Yes, of course, and glad to do so. You are the only man who can arrange
      the affair, if it is to be done at all. But I tell you, as you know, that
      everything will depend upon a leader, even if you secure the men.... So
      you had better keep the letter for to-night. It may help you to get the
      men together. A woman's handwriting will do more than a man's word any
      time."
    
    
      Jaspar Hume's eyes had been looking at the factor, but they were studying
      something else. His face seemed not quite so fresh as it was a few minutes
      before.
    
    
      "I will see you at ten o'clock to-morrow morning, Mr. Field," he said
      quietly. "Will you let Gosse come to me in an hour?"
    
    
      "Certainly. Good-night."
    
    
      Jaspar Hume let himself out. He walked across a small square to a log
      house and opened a door which creaked and shrieked with the frost. A dog
      sprang upon him as he did so, and rubbed its head against his breast. He
      touched the head as if it had been that of a child, and said: "Lie down,
      Bouche."
    
    
      It did so, but it watched him as he doffed his dogskin cap and buffalo
      coat. He looked round the room slowly once as though he wished to fix it
      clearly and deeply in his mind. Then he sat down and held near the
      firelight the letter the factor had given him. His features grew stern and
      set as he read it. Once he paused in the reading and looked into the fire,
      drawing his breath sharply between his teeth. Then he read it to the end
      without a sign. A pause, and he said aloud: "So this is how the lines meet
      again, Varre Lepage!" He read the last sentence of the letter aloud:
    

   In the hope that you may soon give me good news of my husband,
   I am, with all respect,

               Faithfully yours,

                       ROSE LEPAGE.

    
      Again he repeated: "With all respect, faithfully yours, Rose Lepage."
    
    
      The dog Bouche looked up. Perhaps it detected something unusual in the
      voice. It rose, came over, and laid its head on its master's knee. Hume's
      hand fell gently on the head, and he said to the fire: "Ah, Rose Lepage,
      you can write to Factor Field what you dare not write to your husband if
      you knew. You might say to him then, 'With all love,' but not 'With all
      respect.'"
    
    
      He folded the letter and put it in his pocket. Then he took the dog's head
      between his hands and said: "Listen, Bouche, and I will tell you a story."
      The dog blinked, and pushed its nose against his arm.
    
    
      "Ten years ago two young men who had studied and graduated together at the
      same college were struggling together in their profession as civil
      engineers. One was Clive Lepage and the other was Jaspar Hume. The one was
      brilliant and persuasive, the other, persistent and studious. Lepage could
      have succeeded in any profession; Hume had only heart and mind for one.
    
    
      "Only for one, Bouche, you understand. He lived in it, he loved it, he saw
      great things to be achieved in it. He had got an idea. He worked at it
      night and day, he thought it out, he developed it, he perfected it, he was
      ready to give it to the world. But he was seized with illness, became
      blind, and was ordered to a warm climate for a year. He left his idea, his
      invention, behind him       his complete idea. While he was gone his bosom
      friend stole his perfected idea       yes, stole it, and sold it for
      twenty thousand dollars. He was called a genius, a great inventor. And
      then he married her. You don't know her, Bouche. You never saw beautiful
      Rose Varcoe, who, liking two men, chose the one who was handsome and
      brilliant, and whom the world called a genius. Why didn't Jaspar Hume
      expose him, Bouche? Proof is not always easy, and then he had to think of
      her. One has to think of a woman in such a case, Bouche. Even a dog can
      see that."
    
    
      He was silent for a moment, and then he said: "Come, Bouche. You will keep
      secret what I show you."
    
    
      He went to a large box in the corner, unlocked it, and took out a model
      made of brass and copper and smooth but unpolished wood.
    
    
      "After ten years of banishment, Bouche, Hume has worked out another idea,
      you see. It should be worth ten times the other, and the world called the
      other the work of a genius, dog."
    
    
      Then he became silent, the animal watching him the while. It had seen him
      working at this model for many a day, but had never heard him talk so much
      at a time as he had done this last ten minutes. He was generally a silent
      man       decisive even to severity, careless carriers and shirking
      under-officers thought. Yet none could complain that he was unjust. He was
      simply straight-forward, and he had no sympathy with those who had not the
      same quality. He had carried a drunken Indian on his back for miles, and
      from a certain death by frost. He had, for want of a more convenient
      punishment, promptly knocked down Jeff Hyde, the sometime bully of the
      fort, for appropriating a bundle of furs belonging to a French half-breed,
      Gaspe Toujours. But he nursed Jeff Hyde through an attack of pneumonia,
      insisting at the same time that Gaspe Toujours should help him. The result
      of it all was that Jeff Hyde and Gaspe Toujours became constant allies.
      They both formulated their oaths by Jaspar Hume. The Indian,
      Cloud-in-the-Sky, though by word never thanking his rescuer, could not be
      induced to leave the fort, except on some mission with which Jaspar Hume
      was connected. He preferred living an undignified, un-Indian life, and
      earning food and shelter by coarsely labouring with his hands. He came at
      least twice a week to Hume's log house, and, sitting down silent and
      cross-legged before the fire, watched the sub-factor working at his
      drawings and calculations. Sitting so for perhaps an hour or more, and
      smoking all the time, he would rise, and with a grunt, which was answered
      by a kindly nod, would pass out as silently as he came.
    
    
      And now as Jaspar Hume stood looking at his "Idea," Cloud-in-the-Sky
      entered, let his blanket fall by the hearthstone and sat down upon it. If
      Hume saw him or heard him, he at least gave no sign at first. But he said
      at last in a low tone to the dog: "It is finished, Bouche; it is ready for
      the world."
    
    
      Then he put it back, locked the box, and turned towards Cloud-in-the-Sky
      and the fireplace. The Indian grunted; the other nodded with the debating
      look again dominant in his eyes. The Indian met the look with
      satisfaction. There was something in Jaspar Hume's habitual reticence and
      decisiveness in action which appealed more to Cloud-in-the-Sky than any
      freedom of speech could possibly have done.
    
    
      Hume sat down, handed the Indian a pipe and tobacco, and, with arms
      folded, watched the fire. For half an hour they sat so, white man, Indian,
      and dog. Then Hume rose, went to a cupboard, took out some sealing wax and
      matches, and in a moment melted wax was dropping upon the lock of the box
      containing his Idea. He had just finished this as Sergeant Gosse knocked
      at the door, and immediately afterwards entered the room.
    
    
      "Gosse," said the sub-factor, "find Jeff Hyde, Gaspe Toujours, and Late
      Carscallen, and bring them here." Sergeant Gosse immediately departed upon
      this errand. Hume then turned to the Indian, and said "Cloud-in-the-Sky, I
      want you to go a long journey hereaway to the Barren Grounds. Have twelve
      dogs ready by nine to-morrow morning."
    
    
      Cloud-in-the-Sky shook his head thoughtfully, and then after a pause said:
      "Strong-back go too?" Strongback was his name for the sub-factor. But the
      other either did not or would not hear. The Indian, however, appeared
      satisfied, for he smoked harder afterwards, and grunted to himself many
      times. A few moments passed, and then Sergeant Gosse entered, followed by
      Jeff Hyde, Gaspe Toujours, and Late Carscallen. Late Carscallen had got
      his name "Late" from having been called "The Late Mr. Carscallen" by the
      chief factor because of his slowness. Slow as he was, however, the stout
      Scotsman had more than once proved himself a man of rare merit according
      to Hume's ideas. He was, of course, the last to enter.
    
    
      The men grouped themselves about the fire, Late Carscallen getting the
      coldest corner. Each man drew his tobacco from his pocket, and, cutting
      it, waited for Hume to speak. His eyes were debating as they rested on the
      four. Then he took out Mrs. Lepage's letter, and, with the group looking
      at him, he read it aloud. When it was finished, Cloud-in-the-Sky gave a
      guttural assent, and Gaspe Toujours, looking at Jeff Hyde, said: "It is
      cold in the Barren Grounds. We shall need much tabac." These men could
      read without difficulty Hume's reason for summoning them. To Gaspe
      Toujours' remark Jeff Hyde nodded affirmatively, and then all looked at
      Late Carscallen. He opened his heavy jaws once or twice with an
      animal-like sound, and then he said, in a general kind of way:
    
    
      "To the Barren Grounds. But who leads?"
    
    
      Hume was writing on a slip of paper, and he did not reply. The faces of
      three of them showed just a shade of anxiety. They guessed who it would
      be, but they were not sure. Cloud-in-the-Sky, however, grunted at them,
      and raised the bowl of his pipe towards the subfactor. The anxiety then
      seemed to disappear.
    
    
      For ten minutes more they sat so, all silent. Then Hume rose, handed the
      slip of paper to Sergeant Gosse, and said: "Attend to that at once, Gosse.
      Examine the food and blankets closely."
    
    
      The five were left alone.
    
    
      Then Hume spoke: "Jeff Hyde, Gaspe Toujours, Late Carscallen, and
      Cloud-in-the-Sky, this man, alive or dead, is between here and the Barren
      Grounds. He must be found       for his wife's sake."
    
    
      He handed Jeff Hyde her letter. Jeff rubbed his fingers before he touched
      the delicate and perfumed missive. Its delicacy seemed to bewilder him. He
      said: in a rough but kindly way: "Hope to die if I don't," and passed it
      on to Gaspe Toujours, who did not find it necessary to speak. His comrade
      had answered for him. Late Carscallen held it inquisitively for a moment,
      and then his jaws opened and shut as if he were about to speak. But before
      he did so Hume said: "It is a long journey and a hard one. Those who go
      may never come back. But this man was working for his country, and he has
      got a wife       a good wife." He held up the letter. "Late Carscallen
      wants to know who will lead you. Can't you trust me? I will give you a
      leader that you will follow to the Barren Grounds. To-morrow you will know
      who he is. Are you satisfied? Will you do it?"
    
    
      The four rose, and Cloud-in-the-Sky nodded approvingly many times. Hume
      held out his hand. Each man shook it, Jeff Hyde first. Then he said:
      "Close up ranks for the H.B.C.!" (H.B.C. meaning, of course, Hudson's Bay
      Company.)
    
    
      With a good man to lead them, these four would have stormed, alone, the
      Heights of Balaklava.
    
    
      Once more Hume spoke. "Go to Gosse and get your outfits at nine to-morrow
      morning. Cloud-in-the-Sky, have your sleds at the store at eight o'clock,
      to be loaded. Then all meet me at 10.15 at the office of the chief factor.
      Good night."
    
    
      As they passed out into the semi-arctic night, Late Carscallen with an
      unreal obstinacy said: "Slow march to the Barren Grounds       but who
      leads?"
    
    
      Left alone Hume sat down to the pine table at one end of the room and
      after a short hesitation began to write. For hours he sat there, rising
      only to put wood on the fire. The result was three letters: the largest
      addressed to a famous society in London, one to a solicitor in Montreal,
      and one to Mr. Field, the chief factor. They were all sealed carefully.
      Then he rose, took out his knife, and went over to the box as if to break
      the red seal. He paused, however, sighed, and put the knife back again. As
      he did so he felt something touch his leg. It was the dog.
    
    
      Hume drew in a sharp breath and said: "It was all ready, Bouche; and in
      another six months I should have been in London with it. But it will go
      whether I go or not       whether I go or not, Bouche."
    
    
      The dog sprang up and put his head against his master's breast.
    
    
      "Good dog, good dog, it's all right, Bouche; however it goes, it's all
      right," said Hume.
    
    
      Then the dog lay down and watched his master until he drew the blankets to
      his chin, and sleep drew oblivion over a fighting soul.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      II
    
    
      At ten o'clock next morning Jaspar Hume presented himself at the chief
      factor's office. He bore with him the letters he had written the night
      before.
    
    
      The factor said: "Well, Hume, I am glad to see you. That woman's letter
      was on my mind all night. Have you anything to propose? I suppose not," he
      added despairingly, as he looked closely into the face of the other. "Yes,
      Mr. Field, I propose that the expedition start at noon to-day."
    
    
      "Start-at noon-to-day?"
    
    
      "In two hours."
    
    
      "Who are the party?"
    
    
      "Jeff Hyde, Gaspe Toujours, Late Carscallen, and Cloud-in-the-Sky."
    
    
      "Who leads them, Hume? Who leads?"
    
    
      "With your permission, I do."
    
    
      "You? But, man, consider the danger and       your invention!"
    
    
      "I have considered all. Here are three letters. If we do not come back in
      three months, you will please send this one, with the box in my room, to
      the address on the envelope. This is for a solicitor in Montreal, which
      you will also forward as soon as possible; and this last one is for
      yourself; but you will not open it until the three months have passed.
      Have I your permission to lead these men? They would not go without me."
    
    
      "I know that, I know that, Hume. I can't say no. Go, and good luck go with
      you."
    
    
      Here the manly old factor turned away his head. He knew that Hume had done
      right. He knew the possible sacrifice this man was making of all his
      hopes, of his very life; and his sound Scotch heart appreciated the act to
      the full. But he did not know all. He did not know that Jaspar Hume was
      starting to search for the man who had robbed him of youth and hope and
      genius and home.
    
    
      "Here is a letter that the wife has written to her husband on the chance
      of his getting it. You will take it with you, Hume. And the other she
      wrote to me       shall I keep it?" He held out his hand.
    
    
      "No, sir, I will keep it, if you will allow me. It is my commission, you
      know." The shadow of a smile hovered about Hume's lips.
    
    
      The factor smiled kindly as he replied: "Ah, yes, your commission       Captain
      Jaspar Hume of       of what?" Just then the door opened and there entered
      the four men who had sat before the sub-factor's fire the night before.
      They were dressed in white blanket costumes from head to foot, white
      woollen capotes covering the grey fur caps they wore. Jaspar Hume ran his
      eye over them and then answered the factor's question: "Of the White
      Guard, sir."
    
    
      "Good," was the reply. "Men, you are going on a relief expedition. There
      will be danger. You need a good leader. You have one in Captain Hume."
    
    
      Jeff Hyde shook his head at the others with a pleased I-told-you-so
      expression; Cloud-in-the-Sky grunted his deep approval; and Late
      Carscallen smacked his lips in a satisfied manner and rubbed his leg with
      a schoolboy sense of enjoyment. The factor continued: "In the name of the
      Hudson's Bay Company I will say that if you come back, having done your
      duty faithfully, you shall be well rewarded. And I believe you will come
      back, if it is in human power to do so."
    
    
      Here Jeff Hyde said: "It isn't for reward we're doin' it, Mr. Field, but
      because Mr. Hume wished it, because we believed he'd lead us; and for the
      lost fellow's wife. We wouldn't have said we'd do it, if it wasn't for him
      that's just called us the White Guard."
    
    
      Under the bronze of the sub-factor's face there spread a glow more red
      than brown, and he said simply: "Thank you, men"       for they had all
      nodded assent to Jeff Hyde's words       "come with me to the store. We
      will start at noon."
    
    
      At noon the White Guard stood in front of the store on which the British
      flag was hoisted with another beneath it bearing the magic letters,
      H.B.C.: magic, because they opened to the world regions that seemed
      destined never to know the touch of civilisation. The few inhabitants of
      the fort were gathered at the store; the dogs and loaded sleds were at the
      door. It wanted but two minutes to twelve when Hume came from his house,
      dressed also in the white blanket costume, and followed by his dog,
      Bouche. In a moment more he had placed Bouche at the head of the first
      team of dogs. They were to have their leader too. Punctually at noon, Hume
      shook hands with the factor, said a quick good-bye to the rest, called out
      a friendly "How!" to the Indians standing near, and to the sound of a
      hearty cheer, heartier perhaps because none had a confident hope that the
      five would come back, the march of the White Guard began.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      III
    
    
      It was eighteen days after. In the shadow of a little island of pines,
      that lies in a shivering waste of ice and snow, the White Guard were
      camped. They were able to do this night what they had not done for days       dig
      a great grave of snow, and building a fire of pine wood at each end of
      this strange house, get protection and something like comfort. They sat
      silent close to the fires. Jaspar Hume was writing with numbed fingers.
      The extract that follows is taken from his diary. It tells that day's
      life, and so gives an idea of harder, sterner days that they had spent and
      must yet spend, on this weary journey.
    

   December 25th.       This is Christmas Day and Camp twenty-seven. We
   have marched only five miles to-day. We are eighty miles from Great
   Fish River, and the worst yet to do. We have discovered no signs.
   Jeff Hyde has had a bad two days with his frozen foot. Gaspe
   Toujours helps him nobly. One of the dogs died this morning.
   Bouche is a great leader. This night's shelter is a god-send.
   Cloud-in-the-Sky has a plan whereby some of us will sleep well. We
   are in latitude 63deg 47' and longitude 112deg 32' 14". Have worked
   out lunar observations. Have marked a tree JH/27 and raised cairn
   No. 3.

   We are able to celebrate Christmas Day with a good basin of tea and
   our stand-by of beans cooked in fat. I was right about them: they
   have great sustaining power. To-morrow we will start at ten
   o'clock.

    
      The writing done, Jaspar Hume put his book away and turned towards the
      rest. Cloud-in-the-Sky and Late Carscallen were smoking. Little could be
      seen of their faces; they were snuffled to the eyes. Gaspe Toujours was
      drinking a basin of tea, and Jeff Hyde was fitfully dozing by the fire.
      The dogs were above in the tent       all but Bouche, who was permitted to
      be near his master. Presently the sub-factor rose, took from a knapsack a
      small tin pail, and put it near the fire. Then he took five little cups
      that fitted snugly into each other, separated them, and put them also near
      the fire. None of the party spoke. A change seemed to pass over the faces
      of all except Cloud-in-the-Sky. He smoked on unmoved. At length Hume spoke
      cheerily: "Now, men, before we turn in we'll do something in honour of the
      day. Liquor we none of us have touched since we started; but back there in
      the fort, and maybe in other places too, they will be thinking of us; so
      we'll drink a health to them, though it's but a spoonful, and to the day
      when we see them again!"
    
    
      The cups were passed round. The sub-factor measured out a very small
      portion to each. They were not men of uncommon sentiment; their lives were
      rigid and isolated and severe. Fireside comforts under fortunate
      conditions they saw but seldom, and they were not given to expressing
      their feelings demonstratively. But each man then, save Cloud-in-the-Sky,
      had some memory worth a resurrection.
    
    
      Jaspar Hume raised his cup; the rest followed his example. "To absent
      friends and the day when we see them again!" he said; and they all drank.
      Gaspe Toujours drank solemnly, and, as though no one was near, made the
      sign of the cross; for his memory was with a dark-eyed, soft-cheeked
      habitant girl of the parish of Saint Gabrielle, whom he had left behind
      seven years before, and had never seen since. Word had come from the
      parish priest that she was dying, and though he wrote back in his homely
      patois of his grief, and begged that the good father would write again, no
      word had ever come. He thought of her now as one for whom the candles had
      been lighted and masses had been said.
    
    
      But Jeff Hyde's eyes were bright, and suffering as he was, the heart in
      him was brave and hopeful. He was thinking of a glorious Christmas Day
      upon the Madawaska River three years agone; of Adam Henry, the blind
      fiddler; of bright, warm-hearted Pattie Chown, the belle of the ball, and
      the long drive home in the frosty night.
    
    
      Late Carscallen was thinking of a brother whom he had heard preach his
      first sermon in Edinburgh twenty years before. And Late Carscallen, slow
      of speech and thought, had been full of pride and love of that brilliant
      brother. In the natural course of things, they had drifted apart, the slow
      and uncouth one to make his home at last in the Far North, and to be this
      night on his way to the Barren Grounds. But as he stood with the cup to
      his lips he recalled the words of a newspaper paragraph of a few months
      before. It stated that "the Reverend James Carscallen, D.D., preached
      before Her Majesty on Whitsunday, and had the honour of lunching with Her
      Majesty afterwards." Remembering that, Late Carscallen rubbed his left
      hand joyfully against his blanketed leg and drank.
    
    
      Cloud-in-the-Sky's thoughts were with the present, and his "Ugh!" of
      approval was one of the senses purely. Instead of drinking to absent
      friends he looked at the sub-factor and said: "How!" He drank to the
      subfactor.
    
    
      Jaspar Hume had a memory of childhood; of a house beside a swift-flowing
      river, where a gentle widowed mother braced her heart against misfortune
      and denied herself and slaved that her son might be educated. He had said
      to her that some day he would be a great man, and she would be paid back a
      hundredfold. And he had worked hard at school, very hard. But one cold day
      of spring a message came to the school, and he sped homewards to the house
      beside the dark river down which the ice was floating,       he would
      remember that floating ice to his last day, and entered a quiet room where
      a white-faced woman was breathing away her life. And he fell at her side
      and kissed her hand and called to her; and she waked for a moment only and
      smiled on him, and said: "Be good, my boy, and God will make you great."
      Then she said she was cold, and some one felt her feet       a kind old
      soul who shook her head sadly at him; and a voice, rising out of a strange
      smiling languor, murmured: "I'll away, I'll away to the Promised Land       to
      the Promised Land.... It is cold       so cold       God keep my boy!"
      Then the voice ceased, and the kind old soul who had looked at him,
      pityingly folded her arms about him, and drawing his brown head to her
      breast, kissed him with flowing eyes and whispered: "Come away, laddie,
      come away."
    
    
      But he came back in the night and sat beside her, and remained there till
      the sun grew bright, and then through another day and night, until they
      bore her out of the little house by the river to the frozen hill-side.
    
    
      Sitting here in this winter desolation Jaspar Hume once more beheld these
      scenes of twenty years before and followed himself, a poor dispensing
      clerk in a doctor's office, working for that dream of achievement in which
      his mother believed; for which she hoped. And following further the boy
      that was himself, he saw a friendless first-year man at college, soon,
      however, to make a friend of Clive Lepage, and to see always the best of
      that friend, being himself so true. At last the day came when they both
      graduated together in science, a bright and happy day, succeeded by one
      still brighter, when they both entered a great firm as junior partners.
      Afterwards befell the meeting with Rose Varcoe; and he thought of how he
      praised his friend Lepage to her, and brought him to be introduced to her.
      He recalled all those visions that came to him when, his professional
      triumphs achieved, he should have a happy home, and happy faces by his
      fireside. And the face was to be that of Rose Varcoe, and the others,
      faces of those who should be like her and like himself. He saw, or rather
      felt, that face clouded and anxious when he went away ill and blind for
      health's sake. He did not write to her. The doctors forbade him that. He
      did not ask her to write, for his was so steadfast a nature that he did
      not need letters to keep him true; and he thought she must be the same. He
      did not understand a woman's heart, how it needs remembrances, and needs
      to give remembrances.
    
    
      Hume's face in the light of this fire seemed calm and cold, yet behind it
      was an agony of memory       the memory of the day when he discovered that
      Lepage was married to Rose, and that the trusted friend had grown famous
      and well-to-do on the offspring of his brain. His first thought had been
      one of fierce determination to expose this man who had falsified all
      trust. But then came the thought of the girl, and, most of all, there came
      the words of his dying mother, "Be good, my boy, and God will make you
      great"; and for his mother's sake he had compassion on the girl, and
      sought no restitution from her husband. And now, ten years later, he did
      not regret that he had stayed his hand. The world had ceased to call
      Lepage a genius. He had not fulfilled the hope once held of him. Hume knew
      this from occasional references in scientific journals.
    
    
      And now he was making this journey to save, if he could, Lepage's life.
      Though just on the verge of a new era in his career       to give to the
      world the fruit of ten years' thought and labour, he had set all behind
      him, that he might be true to the friendship of his youth, that he might
      be clear of the strokes of conscience to the last hour of his life.
    
    
      Looking round him now, the debating look came again into his eyes. He
      placed his hand in his breast, and let it rest there for a moment. The
      look became certain and steady, the hand was drawn out, and in it was a
      Book of Common Prayer. Upon the fly-leaf was written: "Jane Hume, to her
      dear son Jaspar, on his twelfth birthday."
    
    
      These men of the White Guard were not used to religious practices,
      whatever their past had been in that regard, and at any other time they
      might have been surprised at this action of their leader. Under some
      circumstances it might have lessened their opinion of him; but his
      influence over them now was complete. They knew they were getting nearer
      to him than they had ever done; even Cloud-in-the-Sky appreciated that.
      Hume spoke no word to them, but looked at them and stood up. They all did
      the same, Jeff Hyde leaning on the shoulders of Gaspe Toujours. He read
      first, four verses of the Thirty-first Psalm, then followed the prayer of
      St. Chrysostom, and the beautiful collect which appeals to the Almighty to
      mercifully look upon the infirmities of men, and to stretch forth His hand
      to keep and defend them in all dangers and necessities. Late Carscallen,
      after a long pause, said "Amen," and Jeff said in a whisper to Gaspe
      Toujours: "That's to the point. Infirmities and dangers and necessities is
      what troubles us."
    
    
      Immediately after, at a sign from the sub-factor, Cloud-in-the-Sky began
      to transfer the burning wood from one fire to the other until only hot
      ashes were left where a great blaze had been. Over these ashes pine twigs
      and branches were spread, and over them again blankets. The word was then
      given to turn in, and Jeff Hyde, Gaspe Toujours, and Late Carscallen lay
      down in this comfortable bed. Each wished to give way to their captain,
      but he would not consent. He and Cloud-in-the-Sky wrapped themselves in
      their blankets like mummies, covering the head completely, and under the
      arctic sky they slept alone in an austere and tenantless world. They never
      know how loftily sardonic Nature can be who have not seen that land where
      the mercury freezes in the tubes, and there is light but no warmth in the
      smile of the sun. Not Sturt in the heart of Australia with the mercury
      bursting the fevered tubes, with the finger-nails breaking like brittle
      glass, with the ink drying instantly on the pen, with the hair fading and
      falling off, would, if he could, have exchanged his lot for that of the
      White Guard. They were in a frozen endlessness that stretched away to a
      world where never voice of man or clip of wing or tread of animal is
      heard. It is the threshold to the undiscovered country, to that untouched
      north whose fields of white are only furrowed by the giant forces of the
      elements; on whose frigid hearthstone no fire is ever lit; where the
      electric phantoms of a nightless land pass and repass, and are never
      still; where the magic needle points not towards the north but darkly
      downward; where the sun never stretches warm hands to him who dares
      confront the terrors of eternal snow.
    
    
      The White Guard slept.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      IV
    
    
      "No, Captain; leave me here and push on to Manitou Mountain. You ought to
      make it in two days. I'm just as safe here as on the sleds, and less
      trouble. A blind man's no good. I'll have a good rest while you're gone,
      and then perhaps my eyes will come out right. My foot's nearly well now."
    
    
      Jeff Hyde was snow-blind. The giant of the party had suffered most.
    
    
      But Hume said in reply: "I won't leave you alone. The dogs can carry you
      as they've done for the last ten days."
    
    
      But Jeff replied: "I'm as safe here as marching, and safer. When the dogs
      are not carrying me, nor any one leading me, you can get on faster; and
      that means everything to us, now don't it?"
    
    
      Hume met the eyes of Gaspe Toujours. He read them. Then he said to Jeff:
      "It shall be as you wish. Late Carscallen, Cloud-in-the-Sky, and myself
      will push on to Manitou Mountain. You and Gaspe Toujours will remain
      here."
    
    
      Jeff Hyde's blind eyes turned towards Gaspe Toujours, who said: "Yes. We
      have plenty tabac."
    
    
      A tent was set up, provisions were put in it, a spirit-lamp and matches
      were added, and the simple menage was complete. Not quite. Jaspar Hume
      looked round. There was not a tree in sight. He stooped and cut away a
      pole that was used for strengthening the runners of the sleds, fastened it
      firmly in the ground, and tied to it a red woollen scarf, used for
      tightening his white blankets round him. Then he said: "Be sure and keep
      that flying."
    
    
      Jeff's face was turned towards the north. The blindman's instinct was
      coming to him. Far off white eddying drifts were rising over long hillocks
      of snow. When he turned round again his face was troubled. It grew more
      troubled, then it brightened up again, and he said to Hume: "Captain,
      would you leave that book with me till you come back       that about
      infirmities, dangers, and necessities? I knew a river-boss who used to
      carry an old spelling-book round with him for luck. It seems to me as if
      that book of yours, Captain, would bring luck to this part of the White
      Guard, that bein' out at heels like has to stay behind."
    
    
      Hume had borne the sufferings of his life with courage; he had led this
      terrible tramp with no tremor at his heart for himself; he was seeking to
      perform a perilous act without any inward shrinking; but Jeff's request
      was the greatest trial of this critical period in his life.
    
    
      Jeff felt, if he could not see, the hesitation of his chief. His rough but
      kind instincts told him something was wrong, and he hastened to add: "Beg
      your pardon, Mr. Hume, it ain't no matter. I oughtn't have asked you for
      it. But it's just like me. I've been a chain on the leg of the White Guard
      this whole tramp."
    
    
      The moment of hesitation had passed before Jeff had said half-a-dozen
      words, and Hume put the book in his hands with the words: "No, Jeff, take
      it. It will bring luck to the White Guard. Keep it safe until I come
      back."
    
    
      Jeff took the book, but hearing a guttural "Ugh" behind him, he turned
      round defiantly. Cloud-in-the-Sky touched his arm and said: "Good!
      Strong-back book       good!" Jeff was satisfied.
    
    
      At this point they parted, Jeff and Gaspe Toujours remaining, and Hume and
      his two followers going on towards Manitou Mountain. There seemed little
      probability that Clive Lepage would be found. In their progress eastward
      and northward they had covered wide areas of country, dividing and meeting
      again after stated hours of travel, but not a sign had been seen; neither
      cairn nor staff nor any mark of human presence.
    
    
      Hume had noticed Jeff Hyde's face when it was turned to the eddying drifts
      of the north, and he understood what was in the experienced huntsman's
      mind. He knew that severe weather was before them, and that the greatest
      danger of the journey was to be encountered.
    
    
      That night they saw Manitou Mountain, cold, colossal, harshly calm; and
      jointly with that sight there arose a shrieking, biting, fearful north
      wind. It blew upon them in cruel menace of conquest, in piercing
      inclemency. It struck a freezing terror to their hearts, and grew in
      violent attack until, as if repenting that it had foregone its power to
      save, the sun suddenly grew red and angry, and spread out a shield of
      blood along the bastions of the west. The wind shrank back and grew less
      murderous, and ere the last red arrow shot up behind the lonely western
      wall of white, the three knew that the worst of the storm had passed and
      that death had drawn back for a time. What Hume thought may be gathered
      from his diary; for ere he crawled in among the dogs and stretched himself
      out beside Bouche, he wrote these words with aching fingers:
    

   January 10th: Camp 39.       A bitter day. We are facing three fears
   now: the fate of those we left behind; Lepage's fate; and the going
   back. We are twenty miles from Manitou Mountain. If he is found,
   I should not fear the return journey; success gives hope. But we
   trust in God.

    
      Another day passed and at night, after a hard march, they camped five
      miles from Manitou Mountain. And not a sign! But Hume felt there was a
      faint chance of Lepage being found at this mountain. His iron frame had
      borne the hardships of this journey well; his strong heart better. But
      this night an unaccountable weakness possessed him. Mind and body were on
      the verge of helplessness. Bouche seemed to understand this, and when he
      was unhitched from the team of dogs, now dwindled to seven, he leaped upon
      his master's breast. It was as if some instinct of sympathy, of
      prescience, was passing between the man and the dog. Hume bent his head
      down to Bouche for an instant and rubbed his side kindly; then he said,
      with a tired accent: "It's all right, old dog, it's all right."
    
    
      Hume did not sleep well at first, but at length oblivion came. He waked to
      feel Bouche tugging at his blankets. It was noon. Late Carscallen and
      Cloud-in-the-Sky were still sleeping       inanimate bundles among the
      dogs. In an hour they were on their way again, and towards sunset they had
      reached the foot of Manitou Mountain. Abruptly from the plain rose this
      mighty mound, blue and white upon a black base. A few straggling pines
      grew near its foot, defying latitude, as the mountain itself defied the
      calculations of geographers and geologists. A halt was called. Late
      Carscallen and Cloud-in-the-Sky looked at the chief. His eyes were
      scanning the mountain closely. Suddenly he motioned. A hundred feet up
      there was a great round hole in the solid rock, and from this hole there
      came a feeble cloud of smoke! The other two saw also. Cloud-in-the-Sky
      gave a wild whoop, and from the mountain there came, a moment after, a
      faint replica of the sound. It was not an echo, for there appeared at the
      mouth of the cave an Indian, who made feeble signs for them to come. In a
      little while they were at the cave. As Jaspar Hume entered,
      Cloud-in-the-Sky and the stalwart but emaciated Indian who had beckoned to
      them spoke to each other in the Chinook language, the jargon common to all
      Indians of the West.
    
    
      Jaspar Hume saw a form reclining on a great bundle of pine branches, and
      he knew what Rose Lepage had prayed for was come to pass. By the
      flickering light of a handful of fire he saw Lepage       rather what was
      left of him       a shadow of energy, a heap of nerveless bones. His eyes
      were shut, but as Hume, with a quiver of memory and sympathy at his heart,
      stood for an instant, and looked at the man whom he had cherished as a
      friend and found an enemy, Lepage's lips moved and a weak voice said: "Who
      is there?"
    
    
      "A friend."
    
    
      "Come-near-me,       friend."
    
    
      Hume made a motion to Late Carscallen, who was heating some liquor at the
      fire, and then he stooped and lifted up the sick man's head, and took his
      hand. "You have come       to save me!" whispered the weak voice again.
    
    
      "Yes; I've come to save you." This voice was strong and clear and true.
    
    
      "I seem       to have       heard       your voice before       somewhere
      before       I seem to       have       "
    
    
      But he had fainted.
    
    
      Hume poured a little liquor down the sick man's throat, and Late
      Carscallen chafed the delicate hand       delicate in health, it was like
      that of a little child now. When breath came again Hume whispered to his
      helper "Take Cloud-in-the-Sky and get wood; bring fresh branches. Then
      clear one of the sleds, and we will start back with him in the early
      morning."
    
    
      Late Carscallen, looking at the skeleton-like figure, said: "He will never
      get there."
    
    
      "Yes, he will get there," was Hume's reply.
    
    
      "But he is dying."
    
    
      "He goes with me to Fort Providence."
    
    
      "Ay, to Providence he goes, but not with you," said Late Carscallen,
      doggedly.
    
    
      Anger flashed in Hume's eye, but he said quietly "Get the wood,
      Carscallen."
    
    
      Hume was left alone with the starving Indian, who sat beside the fire
      eating voraciously, and with the sufferer, who now was taking mechanically
      a little biscuit sopped in brandy. For a few moments thus, then his sunken
      eyes opened, and he looked dazedly at the man bending above him. Suddenly
      there came into them a look of terror. "You       you       are Jaspar
      Hume," his voice said in an awed whisper.
    
    
      "Yes." The hands of the sub-factor chafed those of the other.
    
    
      "But you said you were a friend, and come to save me."
    
    
      "I have come to save you."
    
    
      There was a shiver of the sufferer's body. This discovery would either
      make him stronger or kill him. Hume knew this, and said: "Lepage, the past
      is past and dead to me; let it be so to you."
    
    
      There was a pause.
    
    
      "How       did you know       about me?"
    
    
      "I was at Fort Providence. There came letters from the Hudson's Bay
      Company, and from your wife, saying that you were making this journey, and
      were six months behind       "
    
    
      "My wife       Rose!"
    
    
      "I have a letter for you from her. She is on her way to Canada. We are to
      take you to her."
    
    
      "To take me       to her." Lepage shook his head sadly, but he pressed to
      his lips the letter that Hume had given him.
    
    
      "To take you to her, Lepage."
    
    
      "No, I shall never see her again."
    
    
      "I tell you, you shall. You can live if you will. You owe that to her       to
      me       to God."
    
    
      "To her       to you       to God. I have been true to none. I have been
      punished. I shall die here."
    
    
      "You shall go to Fort Providence. Do that in payment of your debt to me,
      Lepage. I demand that." In this transgressor there was a latent spark of
      honour, a sense of justice that might have been developed to great causes,
      if some strong nature, seeing his weaknesses, had not condoned them, but
      had appealed to the natural chivalry of an impressionable, vain, and weak
      character. He struggled to meet Hume's eyes, and doing so, he gained
      confidence and said: "I will try to live. I will do you justice       yet."
    
    
      "Your first duty is to eat and drink. We start for Fort Providence
      to-morrow."
    
    
      The sick man stretched out his hand. "Food! Food!" he said.
    
    
      In tiny portions food and drink were given to him, and his strength
      sensibly increased. The cave was soon aglow with the fire kindled by Late
      Carscallen and Cloud-in-the-Sky. There was little speaking, for the sick
      man soon fell asleep. Lepage's Indian told Cloud-in-the-Sky the tale of
      their march       how the other Indian and the dogs died; how his master
      became ill as they were starting towards Fort Providence from Manitou
      Mountain in the summer weather; how they turned back and took refuge in
      this cave; how month by month they had lived on what would hardly keep a
      rabbit alive; and how, at last, his master urged him to press on with his
      papers; but he would not, and stayed until this day, when the last bit of
      food had been eaten, and they were found.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      V
    
    
      The next morning Lepage was placed upon a sled, and they started back,
      Bouche barking joyfully as he led off, with Cloud-in-the-Sky beside him.
      There was light in the faces of all, though the light could not be seen by
      reason of their being muffled so. All day they travelled, scarcely
      halting, Lepage's Indian marching well. Often the corpse-like bundle on
      the sled was disturbed, and biscuits wet in brandy and bits of preserved
      venison were given.
    
    
      That night Hume said to Late Carscallen: "I am going to start at the first
      light of the morning to get to Gaspe Toujours and Jeff Hyde as soon as
      possible. Follow as fast as you can. He will be safe, if you give him food
      and drink often. I shall get to the place where we left them about noon;
      you should reach there at night or early the next morning."
    
    
      "Hadn't you better take Bouche with you?" said Late Carscallen.
    
    
      The sub-factor thought a moment, and then said: "No, he is needed most
      where he is."
    
    
      At noon the next day Jaspar Hume looked round upon a billowy plain of sun
      and ice, but saw no staff, no signal, no tent, no sign of human life: of
      Gaspe Toujours or of Jeff Hyde. His strong heart quailed. Had he lost his
      way? He looked at the sun. He was not sure. He consulted his compass, but
      it quivered hesitatingly. For awhile that wild bewilderment which seizes
      upon the minds of the strongest, when lost, mastered him, in spite of his
      struggles against it. He moved in a maze of half-blindness, half-delirium.
      He was lost in it, swayed by it. He began to wander about; and there grew
      upon his senses strange delights and reeling agonies. He heard church
      bells, he caught at butterflies, he tumbled in new-mown hay, he wandered
      in a tropic garden. But in the hay a wasp stung him, and the butterfly
      changed to a curling black snake that struck at him and glided to a
      dark-flowing river full of floating ice, and up from the river a white
      hand was thrust, and it beckoned him       beckoned him. He shut his eyes
      and moved towards it, but a voice stopped him, and it said, "Come away,
      come away," and two arms folded him round, and as he went back from the
      shore he stumbled and fell, and... What is this? A yielding mass at his
      feet       a mass that stirs! He clutches at it, he tears away the snow,
      he calls aloud       and his voice has a faraway unnatural sound       "Gaspe
      Toujours! Gaspe Toujours!" Then the figure of a man shakes itself in the
      snow, and a voice says: "Ay, ay, sir!" Yes, it is Gaspe Toujours! And
      beside him lies Jeff Hyde, and alive. "Ay, ay, sir, alive!"
    
    
      Jaspar Hume's mind was itself again. It had but suffered for a moment the
      agony of delirium.
    
    
      Gaspe Toujours and Jeff Hyde had lain down in the tent the night of the
      great wind, and had gone to sleep at once. The staff had been blown down,
      the tent had fallen over them, the drift had covered them, and for three
      days they had slept beneath the snow, never waking.
    
    
      Jeff Hyde's sight was come again to him. "You've come back for the book,"
      he said. "You couldn't go on without it. You ought to have taken it
      yesterday."
    
    
      He drew it from his pocket. He was dazed.
    
    
      "No, Jeff, I've not come back for that, and I did not leave you yesterday:
      it is three days and more since we parted. The book has brought us luck,
      and the best. We have found our man; and they'll be here to-night with
      him. I came on ahead to see how you fared."
    
    
      In that frost-bitten world Jeff Hyde uncovered his head for a moment.
      "Gaspe Toujours is a papist," he said, "but he read me some of that book
      the day you left, and one thing we went to sleep on: it was that about
      'Lightenin' the darkness, and defendin' us from all the perils and dangers
      of this night.'" Here Gaspe Toujours made the sign of the cross. Jeff Hyde
      continued half apologetically for his comrade: "That comes natural to
      Gaspe Toujours       I guess it always does to papists. But I never had
      any trainin' that way, and I had to turn the thing over and over, and I
      fell asleep on it. And when I wake up three days after, here's my eyes as
      fresh as daisies, and you back, sir, and the thing done that we come to
      do."
    
    
      He put the Book into Hume's hands and at that moment Gaspe Toujours said:
      "See!" Far off, against the eastern horizon, appeared a group of moving
      figures.
    
    
      That night the broken segments of the White Guard were reunited, and Clive
      Lepage slept by the side of Jaspar Hume.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      VI
    
    
      Napoleon might have marched back from Moscow with undecimated legions
      safely enough, if the heart of those legions had not been crushed. The
      White Guard, with their faces turned homeward, and the man they had sought
      for in their care, seemed to have acquired new strength. Through days of
      dreadful cold, through nights of appalling fierceness, through storm upon
      the plains that made for them paralysing coverlets, they marched. And if
      Lepage did not grow stronger, life at least was kept in him.
    
    
      There was little speech among them, but once in a while Gaspe Toujours
      sang snatches of the songs of the voyageurs of the great rivers; and the
      hearts of all were strong. Between Bouche and his master there was
      occasional demonstration. On the twentieth day homeward, Hume said with
      his hand on the dog's head "It had to be done, Bouche; even a dog could
      see that."
    
    
      And so it was "all right" for the White Guard. One day when the sun was
      warmer than usual over Fort Providence, and just sixty-five days since
      that cheer had gone up from apprehensive hearts for brave men going out
      into the Barren Grounds, Sergeant Gosse, who, every day, and of late many
      times a day, had swept the north-east with a field-glass, rushed into the
      chief-factor's office, and with a broken voice cried: "They've all come!
      They've come!" Then he leaned his arm and head against the wall and
      sobbed. And the old factor rose from his chair tremblingly, and said his
      thank-god, and went hurriedly into the square. He did not go steadily,
      however, the joyous news had shaken him, sturdy old pioneer as he was. A
      fringe of white had grown about his temples in the last two months. The
      people of the fort had said they had never seen him so irascible, yet so
      gentle; so uneasy, yet so reserved; so stern about the mouth, yet so kind
      about the eyes as he had been since Hume had gone on this desperate
      errand.
    
    
      Already the handful of people at the fort had gathered. Indians left the
      store, and joined the rest; the factor and Sergeant Gosse set out to meet
      the little army of relief. To the factor's "In the name of the Hudson's
      Bay Company, Mr. Hume," when they met there came "By the help of God,
      sir," and he pointed to the sled whereon Lepage lay. A feeble hand was
      clasped in the burly hand of the factor, and then they all fell into line
      again, Cloud-in-the-Sky running ahead of the dogs. Snow had fallen on
      them, and as they entered the stockade, men and dogs were white from head
      to foot.
    
    
      The White Guard had come back. Jaspar Hume as simply acknowledged his
      strident welcome as he had done the God-speed two months and more ago.
      With the factor he bore the sick man in, and laid him on his own bed. Then
      he came outside again, and when they cheered him once more, he said: "We
      have come safe through, and I'm thankful. But remember that my comrades in
      this march deserve your cheers more than I. Without them I couldn't have
      done anything."
    
    
      "In our infirmities and in all our dangers and necessities," added Jeff
      Hyde. "The luck of the world was in that book!"
    
    
      In another half-hour the White Guard was at ease, and four of them were
      gathered about the great stove in the store, Cloud-in-the-Sky smoking
      placidly, and full of guttural emphasis; Late Carscallen moving his
      animal-like jaws with a sense of satisfaction; Gaspe Toujours talking in
      Chinook to the Indians, in patois to the French clerk, and in broken
      English to them all; and Jeff Hyde exclaiming on the wonders of the march,
      the finding of Lepage at Manitou Mountain, and of himself and Gaspe
      Toujours buried in the snow.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      VII
    
    
      In Hume's house at midnight Lepage lay asleep with his wife's letters       received
      through the factor       in his hand. The firelight played upon a dark,
      disappointed face       a doomed, prematurely old face, as it seemed to
      the factor.
    
    
      "You knew him, then," the factor said, after a long silence, with a
      gesture towards the bed.
    
    
      "Yes, well, years ago," replied Hume.
    
    
      Just then the sick man stirred in his sleep, and he said disjointedly:
      "I'll make it all right to you, Hume." Then came a pause, and a quicker
      utterance: "Forgive       forgive me, Rose." The factor got up, and turned
      to go, and Hume, with a sorrowful gesture, went over to the bed.
    
    
      Again the voice said: "Ten years       I have repented ten years       I
      dare not speak       "
    
    
      The factor touched Hume's arm. "He has fever. You and I must nurse him,
      Hume. You can trust me       you understand."
    
    
      "Yes, I can trust you," was the reply. "But I can tell you nothing."
    
    
      "I do not want to know anything. If you can watch till two o'clock I will
      relieve you. I'll send the medicine chest over. You know how to treat
      him."
    
    
      The factor passed out, and the other was left alone with the man who had
      wronged him. The feeling most active in his mind was pity, and, as he
      prepared a draught from his own stock of medicines, he thought the past
      and the present all over. He knew that however much he had suffered, this
      man had suffered more. In this silent night there was broken down any
      barrier that may have stood between Lepage and his complete compassion.
      Having effaced himself from the calculation, justice became forgiveness.
    
    
      He moistened the sick man's lips, and bathed his forehead, and roused him
      once to take a quieting powder. Then he sat down and wrote to Rose Lepage.
      But he tore the letter up again and said to the dog: "No, Bouche, I can't;
      the factor must do it. She needn't know yet that it was I who saved him.
      It doesn't make any burden of gratitude, if my name is kept out of it. The
      factor mustn't mention me, Bouche       not yet. When he is well we will
      go to London with It, Bouche, and we needn't meet her. It will be all
      right, Bouche, all right!"
    
    
      The dog seemed to understand; for he went over to the box that held It;
      and looked at his master. Then Jaspar Hume rose, broke the seal, unlocked
      the box and opened it; but he heard the sick man moan, and he closed it
      again and went over to the bed. The feeble voice said: "I must speak       I
      cannot die so       not so." Hume moistened the lips once, put a cold
      cloth on the fevered head, and then sat down by the fire again.
    
    
      Lepage slept at last. The restless hands grew quiet, the breath became
      more regular, the tortured mind found a short peace. With the old debating
      look in his eyes, Hume sat there watching until the factor relieved him.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      VIII
    
    
      February and March and April were past, and May was come. Lepage had had a
      hard struggle for life, but he had survived. For weeks every night there
      was a repetition of that first night after the return: delirious
      self-condemnation, entreaty, appeal to his wife, and Hume's name mentioned
      in shuddering remorse. With the help of the Indian who had shared the sick
      man's sufferings in the Barren Grounds, the factor and Hume nursed him
      back to life. After the first night no word had passed between the two
      watchers regarding the substance of Lepage's delirium. But one evening the
      factor was watching alone, and the repentant man from his feverish sleep
      cried out: "Hush, hush! don't let them know       I stole them both, and
      Rose did not know. Rose did not know!"
    
    
      The factor rose and walked away. The dog was watching him. He said to
      Bouche: "You have a good master, Bouche."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      IX
    
    
      In an arm-chair made of hickory and birch-bark by Cloud-in-the-Sky, Lepage
      sat reading a letter from his wife. She was at Winnipeg, and was coming
      west as far as Regina to meet him on his way down. He looked a wreck; but
      a handsome wreck. His refined features, his soft black beard and blue
      eyes, his graceful hand and gentle manners, seemed not to belong to an
      evil-hearted man. He sat in the sunlight at the door, wrapped about in
      moose and beaver skins. The world of plain and wood was glad. Not so
      Lepage. He sat and thought of what was to come. He had hoped at times that
      he would die, but twice Hume had said: "I demand your life. You owe it to
      your wife       to me." He had pulled his heart up to this demand and had
      lived. But what lay before him? He saw a stony track, and he shuddered.
    
    
      As he sat there facing the future, Hume came to him and said: "If you feel
      up to it, Lepage, we will start for Edmonton on Monday. I think it will be
      quite safe, and your wife is anxious. I shall accompany you as far as
      Edmonton; you can then proceed by easy stages, in this pleasant weather.
      Are you ready to go?"
    
    
      "Quite ready," was the reply.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      X
    
    
      On a beautiful May evening Lepage, Hume, and the White Guard were welcomed
      at Fort Edmonton by the officer in command of the Mounted Police. They
      were to enjoy the hospitality of the fort for a couple of days. Hume was
      to go back with Cloud-in-the-Sky and Late Carscallen, and a number of
      Indian carriers; for this was a journey of business too. Gaspe Toujours
      and Jeff Hyde were to press on with Lepage, who was now much stronger and
      better. One day passed, and on the following morning Hume gave
      instructions to Gaspe Toujours and Jeff Hyde, and made preparations for
      his going back. He was standing in the Barracks Square, when a horseman
      rode in and made inquiry of a sergeant standing near, if Lepage had
      arrived at the fort. A few words brought out the fact that Rose Lepage was
      nearing the fort from the south. The trooper had been sent on ahead the
      day before, but his horse having met with a slight accident, he had been
      delayed. He had seen the party, however, a long distance back in the early
      morning. He must now ride away and meet Mrs. Lepage, he said. He was
      furnished with a fresh horse, and he left, bearing a message from Lepage.
    
    
      Hume decided to leave Fort Edmonton at once, and to take all the White
      Guard back with him; and gave orders to that effect. Entering the room
      where Lepage sat alone, he said: "Lepage, the time has come for good-bye.
      I am starting for Fort Providence."
    
    
      But the other replied: "You will wait until my wife comes. You must."
      There was trouble in his voice. "I must not."
    
    
      Lepage braced himself for a heavy task and said: "Hume, if the time has
      come to say good-bye, it has also come when we should speak together for
      once openly: to settle, in so far as can be done, a long account. You have
      not let my wife know who saved me. That appears from her letters. She asks
      the name of my rescuer. I have not yet told her. But she will know that
      to-day when I tell her all."
    
    
      "When you tell her all?"
    
    
      "When I tell her all."
    
    
      "But you shall not do that."
    
    
      "I will. It will be the beginning of the confession which I shall
      afterwards make to the world."
    
    
      "By Heaven you shall not do it. Do you want to wreck her life?"
    
    
      Jaspar Hume's face was wrathful, and remained so till the other sank back
      in the chair with his forehead in his hands; but it softened as he saw
      this remorse and shame. He began to see that Lepage had not clearly
      grasped the whole situation. He said in quieter but still firm tones: "No,
      Lepage, that matter is between us two, and us alone. She must never know       the
      world therefore must never know. You did an unmanly thing; you are
      suffering a manly remorse. Now let it end here       but I swear it
      shall," he said in sharp tones, as the other shook his head negatively: "I
      would have let you die at Manitou Mountain, if I had thought you would
      dare to take away your wife's peace       your children's respect."
    
    
      "I have no children; our baby died."
    
    
      Hume softened again. "Can you not see, Lepage? The thing cannot be mended.
      I bury it all, and so must you. You will begin the world again, and so
      shall I. Keep your wife's love. Henceforth you will deserve it."
    
    
      Lepage raised moist eyes to the other and said: "But you will take back
      the money I got for that?"
    
    
      There was a pause, then Hume replied: "Yes, upon such terms, times, and
      conditions as I shall hereafter fix. You have no child, Lepage?" he gently
      added.
    
    
      "We have no child; it died with my fame."
    
    
      Hume looked steadily into the eyes of the man who had wronged him.
      "Remember, Lepage, you begin the world again. I am going now. By the
      memory of old days, good-bye." He held out his hand. Lepage took it, rose
      tremblingly to his feet, and said, "You are a good man, Hume. Good-bye."
    
    
      The sub-factor turned at the door. "If it will please you, tell your wife
      that I saved you. Some one will tell her; perhaps I would rather       at
      least it would be more natural, if you did it."
    
    
      He passed out into the sunshine that streamed into the room and fell
      across the figure of Lepage, who murmured dreamily: "And begin the world
      again."
    
    
      Time passed. A shadow fell across the sunlight that streamed upon Lepage.
      He looked up. There was a startled cry of joy, an answering exclamation of
      love, and Rose was clasped in her husband's arms.
    
    
      A few moments afterwards the sweet-faced woman said: "Who was that man who
      rode away to the north as I came up, Clive? He reminded me of some one."
    
    
      "That was the leader of the White Guard, the man who saved me, Rose." He
      paused a moment and then solemnly said: "It was Jaspar Hume."
    
    
      The wife came to her feet with a spring. "He saved you       Jaspar Hume!
      Oh, Clive!"
    
    
      "He saved me, Rose."
    
    
      Her eyes were wet: "And he would not stay and let me thank him! Poor
      fellow, poor Jaspar Hume! Has he been up here all these years?"
    
    
      Her face was flushed, and pain was struggling with the joy she felt in
      seeing her husband again.
    
    
      "Yes, he has been here all the time."
    
    
      "Then he has not succeeded in life, Clive!" Her thoughts went back to the
      days when, blind and ill, Hume went away for health's sake, and she
      remembered how sorry then she felt for him, and how grieved she was that
      when he came back strong and well, he did not come near her or her
      husband, and offered no congratulations. She had not deliberately wronged
      him. She knew he cared for her: but so did Lepage. A promise had been
      given to neither when Jaspar Hume went away; and after that she grew to
      love the successful, kind-mannered genius who became her husband. No real
      pledge had been broken. Even in this happiness of hers, sitting once again
      at her husband's feet, she thought with tender kindness of the man who had
      cared for her eleven years ago; and who had but now saved her husband.
    
    
      "He has not succeeded in life," she repeated softly. Looking down at her,
      his brow burning with a white heat, Lepage said: "He is a great man,
      Rose."
    
    
      "I am sure he is a good man," she added.
    
    
      Perhaps Lepage had borrowed some strength not all his own, for he said
      almost sternly: "He is a great man."
    
    
      His wife looked up half-startled and said: "Very well, dear; he is a good
      man       and a great man."
    
    
      The sunlight still came in through the open door. The Saskatchewan flowed
      swiftly between its verdant banks, an eagle went floating away to the
      west, robins made vocal a solitary tree a few yards away, troopers moved
      backwards and forwards across the square, and a hen and her chickens came
      fluttering to the threshold. The wife looked at the yellow brood drawing
      close to their mother, and her eyes grew wistful. She thought of their one
      baby asleep in an English grave. But thinking of the words of the captain
      of the White Guard, Lepage said firmly: "We will begin the world again."
    
    
      She smiled, and rose to kiss him as the hen and chickens hastened away
      from the door, and a clear bugle call sounded in the square.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XI
    
    
      Eleven years have gone since that scene was enacted at Edmonton.
    
    
      A great gathering is dispersing from a hall in Piccadilly. It has been
      drawn together to do honour to a man who has achieved a triumph in
      engineering science. As he steps from the platform to go, he is greeted by
      a fusilade of cheers. He bows calmly and kindly. He is a man of vigorous
      yet reserved aspect; he has a rare individuality. He receives with a quiet
      cordiality the personal congratulations of his friends. He remains for
      some time in conversation with a royal duke, who takes his arm, and with
      him passes into the street. The duke is a member of this great man's club,
      and offers him a seat in his brougham. Amid the cheers of the people they
      drive away together. Inside the club there are fresh congratulations, and
      it is proposed to arrange an impromptu dinner, at which the duke will
      preside. But with modesty and honest thanks the great man declines. He
      pleads an engagement. He had pleaded this engagement the day before to a
      well-known society. After his health is proposed, he makes his adieux, and
      leaving the club, walks away towards a West-end square. In one of its
      streets he pauses, and enters a building called "Providence Chambers." His
      servant hands him a cablegram. He passes to his library, and, standing
      before the fire, opens it. It reads: "My wife and I send congratulations
      to the great man."
    
    
      Jaspar Hume stands for a moment looking at the fire, and then says simply:
      "I wish poor old Bouche were here." He then sits down and writes this
      letter:
    

   My dear Friends,       Your cablegram has made me glad. The day is over.
   My latest idea was more successful than I even dared to hope; and
   the world has been kind. I went down to see your boy, Jaspar, at
   Clifton last week. It was his birthday, you know       nine years old,
   and a clever, strong-minded little fellow. He is quite contented.
   As he is my god-child, I again claimed the right of putting a
   thousand dollars to his credit in the bank,       I have to speak of
   dollars to you people living in Canada       which I have done on his
   every birthday. When he is twenty-one he will have twenty-one
   thousand dollars       quite enough for a start in life. We get along
   well together, and I think he will develop a fine faculty for
   science. In the summer, as I said, I will bring him over to you.
   There is nothing more to say to-night except that I am as always,

          Your faithful and loving friend,
                            JASPAR HUME.

    
      A moment after the letter was finished, the servant entered and announced
      "Mr. Late Carscallen." With a smile and hearty greeting the great man and
      this member of the White Guard met. It was to entertain his old arctic
      comrade that Jaspar Hume had declined to be entertained by society or
      club. A little while after, seated at the table, the ex-sub-factor said:
      "You found your brother well, Carscallen?"
    
    
      The jaws moved slowly as of old. "Ay, that, and a grand meenister, sir."
    
    
      "He wanted you to stay in Scotland, I suppose?"
    
    
      "Ay, that, but there's no place for me like Fort Providence."
    
    
      "Try this pheasant. And you are sub-factor now, Carscallen?"
    
    
      "There's two of us sub-factors       Jeff Hyde and myself. Mr. Field is
      old, and can't do much work, and trade's heavy now."
    
    
      "I know. I hear from the factor now and then. And Gaspe Toujours, what of
      him?"
    
    
      "He went away three years ago, and he said he'd come back. He never did
      though. Jeff Hyde believes he will. He says to me a hundred times,
      'Carscallen, he made the sign of the cross that he'd come back from Saint
      Gabrielle; and that's next to the Book with a papist. If he's alive he'll
      come.'"
    
    
      "Perhaps he will, Carscallen. And Cloud-in-the-Sky?"
    
    
      "He's still there, and comes in and smokes with Jeff Hyde and me, as he
      used to do with you; but he doesn't obey our orders as he did yours, sir.
      He said to me when I left: 'You see Strong-back, tell him Cloud-in-the-Sky
      good Injun       he never forget. How!'"
    
    
      Jaspar Hume raised his glass with smiling and thoughtful eyes: "To
      Cloud-in-the-Sky and all who never forget!" he said.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
