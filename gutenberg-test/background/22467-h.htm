<h1>SAND DOOM<br />
<span class='sf75'>BY MURRAY LEINSTER</span><br />
<span class='sf50'>Illustrated by Freas</span></h1>

<p>Bordman knew there was something wrong when the throbbing, acutely
uncomfortable vibration of rocket blasts shook the ship. Rockets were
strictly emergency devices, these days, so when they were used there was
obviously an emergency.</p>

<p>He sat still. He had been reading, in the passenger lounge of the
<i>Warlock</i>&mdash;a very small lounge indeed&mdash;but as a senior Colonial Survey
officer he was well-traveled enough to know when things did not go
right. He looked up from the bookscreen, waiting. Nobody came to explain
the eccentricity of a spaceship using rockets. It would have been
immediate, on a regular liner, but the <i>Warlock</i> was practically a
tramp. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
This trip it carried just two passengers. Passenger service was
not yet authorized to the planet ahead, and would not be until Bordman
had made the report he was on his way to compile. At the moment, though,
the rockets blasted, and stopped, and blasted again. There was something
definitely wrong.</p>

<p>The <i>Warlock&rsquo;s</i> other passenger came out of her cabin. She looked
surprised. She was Aletha Redfeather, an unusually lovely Amerind. It
was extraordinary that a girl could be so self-sufficient on a tedious
space-voyage, and Bordman approved of her. She was making the journey to
Xosa II as a representative of the Amerind Historical Society, but
she&rsquo;d brought her own bookreels and some elaborate fancywork
which&mdash;woman-fashion&mdash;she used to occupy her hands. She hadn&rsquo;t
been at all a nuisance. Now she tilted her head on one side as she
looked inquiringly at Bordman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering, too,&rdquo; he told her, just as an
especially sustained and violent shuddering of rocket-impulsion made his
chair legs thutter on the floor.</p>

<p>There was a long period of stillness. Then another violent but much
shorter blast. A shorter one still. Presently there was a half-second
blast which must have been from a single rocket tube because of the mild
shaking it produced. After that there was nothing at all.</p>

<p>Bordman frowned to himself. He&rsquo;d been anticipating groundfall
within a matter of hours, certainly. He&rsquo;d just gone through his
specbook carefully and re-familiarized himself with the work he was to
survey on Xosa II. It was a perfectly commonplace minerals-planet
development, and he&rsquo;d expected to clear it FE&mdash;fully
established&mdash;and probably TP and NQ ratings as well, indicating that
tourists were permitted and no quarantine was necessary. Considering the
aridity of the planet, no bacteriological dangers could be expected to
exist, and if tourists wanted to view its monstrous deserts and
infernolike wind sculptures&mdash;why they should be welcome.</p>

<p>But the ship had used rocket drive in the planet&rsquo;s near vicinity.
Emergency. Which was ridiculous. This was a perfectly routine sort of
voyage. Its purpose was the delivery of heavy equipment&mdash;specifically a
smelter&mdash;and a senior Colonial Survey officer to report the completion
of primary development.</p>

<p>Aletha waited, as if for more rocket blasts. Presently she smiled at
some thought that had occurred to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this were an adventure tape,&rdquo; she said humorously,
&ldquo;the loudspeaker would now announce that the ship had established
itself in an orbit around the strange, uncharted planet first sighted
three days ago, and that volunteers were wanted for a boat
landing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman demanded impatiently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you bother with adventure tapes? They&rsquo;re nonsense! A
pure waste of time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha smiled again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
&ldquo;My ancestors,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;used to hold tribal
dances and make medicine and boast about how many scalps they&rsquo;d
taken and how they did it. It was satisfying&mdash;and educational for the
young. Adolescents became familiar with the idea of what we nowadays
call adventure. They were partly ready for it when it came. I suspect
your ancestors used to tell each other stories about hunting mammoths
and such. So I think it would be fun to hear that we were in orbit and
that a boat landing was in order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman grunted. There were no longer adventures. The universe was
settled; civilized. Of course there were still frontier planets&mdash;Xosa II
was one&mdash;but pioneers had only hardships. Not adventures.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>The ship-phone speaker clicked. It said curtly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Notice. We have arrived at Xosa II and have established an orbit
about it. A landing will be made by boat.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman&rsquo;s mouth dropped open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adventure, maybe,&rdquo; said Aletha. Her eyes crinkled very
pleasantly when she smiled. She wore the modern Amerind dress&mdash;a sign of
pride in the ancestry which now implied such diverse occupations as
interstellar steel construction and animal husbandry and llano-planet
colonization. &ldquo;If it were adventure, as the only girl on this ship
I&rsquo;d have to be in the landing party, lest the tedium of orbital
waiting make the&rdquo;&mdash;her smile widened to a grin&mdash;&ldquo;the pent-up
restlessness of trouble-makers in the crew&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ship-phone clicked again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mr. Bordman. Miss Redfeather. According to advices from the
ground, the ship may have to stay in orbit for a considerable time. You
will accordingly be landed by boat. Will you make yourselves ready,
please, and report to the boat-blister?</i>&rdquo; The voice paused and
added, &ldquo;<i>Hand luggage only, please.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha&rsquo;s eyes brightened. Bordman felt the shocked incredulity of
a man accustomed to routine when routine is impossibly broken. Of course
survey ships made boat landings from orbit, and colony ships let down
robot hulls by rocket when there was as yet no landing grid for the
handling of a ship. But never before in his experience had an ordinary
freighter, on a routine voyage to a colony ready for its final
degree-of-completion survey, ever landed anybody by boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is ridiculous!&rdquo; said Bordman, fuming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s adventure,&rdquo; said Aletha. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
pack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She disappeared into her cabin. Bordman hesitated. Then he went into his
own. The colony on Xosa II had been established two years ago. Minimum
comfort conditions had been realized within six months. A temporary
landing grid for light supply ships was up within a year. It had
permitted stock-piling, and it had been taken down to be rebuilt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as a permanent grid with every possible contingency provided for. The
eight months since the last ship landing was more than enough for the
building of the gigantic, spidery, half-mile-high structure which would
handle this planet&rsquo;s interstellar commerce. There was no excuse
for an emergency! A boat landing was nonsensical!</p>

<p>But he surveyed the contents of his cabin. Most of the cargo of the
<i>Warlock</i> was smelter equipment which was to complete the outfitting of
the colony. It was to be unloaded first. By the time the ship&rsquo;s
holds were wholly empty, the smelter would be operating. The ship would
wait for a full cargo of pig metal. Bordman had expected to live in this
cabin while he worked on the survey he&rsquo;d come to make, and to
leave again with the ship.</p>

<p>Now he was to go aground by boat. He fretted. The only emergency
equipment he could possibly need was a heat-suit. He doubted the urgency
of that. But he packed some clothing for indoors, and then defiantly
included his specbook and the volumes of definitive data to which
specifications for structures and colonial establishments always
referred. He&rsquo;d get to work on his report immediately he landed.</p>

<p>He went out of the passenger&rsquo;s lounge to the boat-blister. An
engineer&rsquo;s legs projected from the boat port. The engineer
withdrew, with a strip of tape from the boat&rsquo;s computer. He
compared it dourly with a similar strip from the ship&rsquo;s figurebox.
Bordman consciously acted according to the best traditions of
passengers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t land,&rdquo; said the engineer shortly.</p>

<p>He went away&mdash;according to the tradition by which ships&rsquo; crews are
always scornful of passengers.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>Bordman scowled. Then Aletha came, carrying a not-too-heavy bag. Bordman
put it in the boat, disapproving of the crampedness of the craft. But
this wasn&rsquo;t a lifeboat. It was a landing boat. A lifeboat had
Lawlor drive and could travel light-years, but in the place of rockets
and rocket fuel it had air-purifiers and water-recovery units and
food-stores. It couldn&rsquo;t land without a landing grid aground, but
it could get to a civilized planet. This landing boat could land without
a grid, but its air wouldn&rsquo;t last long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; said Bordman darkly,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s incompetence somewhere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. This was a cargo ship. Cargo ships
neither took off nor landed under their own power. It was too costly of
fuel they would have to carry. So landing grids used local power&mdash;which
did not have to be lifted&mdash;to heave ships out into space, and again used
local power to draw them to ground again. Therefore ships carried fuel
only for actual space-flight, which was economy. Yet landing grids had
no moving parts, and while they did have to be monstrous structures they
actually <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
drew power from planetary ionospheres. So with no moving parts to break
down and no possibility of the failure of a power source&mdash;landing
grids couldn&rsquo;t fail! So there couldn&rsquo;t be an emergency to
make a ship ride orbit around a planet which had a landing grid!</p>

<p>The engineer came back. He carried a mail sack full of letter-reels. He
waved his hand. Aletha crawled into the landing-boat port. Bordman
followed. Four people, with a little crowding, could have gotten into
the little ship. Three pretty well filled it. The engineer followed them
and sealed the port.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sealed off,&rdquo; he said into the microphone before him.</p>

<p>The exterior-pressure needle moved halfway across the dial. The
interior-pressure needle stayed steady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All tight,&rdquo; said the engineer.</p>

<p>The exterior-pressure needle flicked to zero. There were clanking
sounds. The long halves of the boat-blister stirred and opened, and
abruptly the landing boat was in an elongated cup in the hull-plating,
and above them there were many, many stars. The enormous disk of a
nearby planet floated into view around the hull. It was monstrous and
blindingly bright. It was of a tawny color, with great, irregular areas
of yellow and patches of bluishness. But most of it was the color of
sand. And all its colors varied in shade&mdash;some places were lighter and
some darker&mdash;and over at one edge there was blinding whiteness which
could not be anything but an ice cap. But Bordman knew that there was no
ocean or sea or lake on all this whole planet, and the ice cap was more
nearly hoarfrost than such mile-deep glaciation as would be found at the
poles of a maximum-comfort world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strap in,&rdquo; said the engineer over his shoulder.
&ldquo;No-gravity coming, and then rocket-push. Settle your
heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman irritably strapped himself in. He saw Aletha busy at the same
task, her eyes shining. Without warning, there came a sensation of acute
discomfort. It was the landing boat detaching itself from the ship and
the diminishment of the ship&rsquo;s closely-confined artificial-gravity
field. That field suddenly dropped to nothingness, and Bordman had the
momentary sickish dizziness that flicked-off gravity always produces. At
the same time his heart pounded unbearably in the instinctive,
racial-memory reaction to the feel of falling.</p>

<p>Then roarings. He was thrust savagely back against his seat. His tongue
tried to slide back into his throat. There was an enormous oppression on
his chest. He found himself thinking panicky profanity.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the vision ports went black, because they were out of the
shadow of the ship. The landing boat turned&mdash;but there was no sensation
of centrifugal force&mdash;and they were in a vast obscurity with merely a
dim phantom of the planetary surface to be seen. But behind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
them a blue-white sun shone terribly. Its light was
warm&mdash;hot&mdash;even though it came through the polarized shielding
ports.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did ... did you say,&rdquo; panted Aletha happily&mdash;breathless
because of the acceleration&mdash;&ldquo;that there weren&rsquo;t any
adventures?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman did not answer. But he did not count discomfort as an adventure.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>The engineer did not look out the ports at all. He watched the screen
before him. There was a vertical line across the side of the lighted
disk. A blip moved downward across it, showing their height in thousands
of miles. After a long time the blip reached the bottom, and the
vertical line became double and another blip began to descend. It
measured height in hundreds of miles. A bright spot&mdash;a square&mdash;appeared
at one side of the screen. A voice muttered metallically, and suddenly
seemed to shout, and then muttered again. Bordman looked out one of the
black ports and saw the planet as if through smoked glass. It was a
ghostly reddish thing which filled half the cosmos. It had mottlings.
Its edge was curved. That would be the horizon.</p>

<p>The engineer moved controls and the white square moved. It went across
the screen. He moved more controls. It came back to the center. The
height-in-hundreds blip was at the bottom, now, and the vertical line
tripled and a tens-of-miles-height blip crawled downward.</p>

<p>There were sudden, monstrous plungings of the landing boat. It had hit
the outermost fringes of atmosphere. The engineer said words it was not
appropriate for Aletha to hear. The plungings became more violent.
Bordman held on&mdash;to keep from being shaken to pieces despite the
straps&mdash;and stared at the murky surface of the planet. It seemed to be
fleeing from them and they to be trying to overtake it. Gradually, very
gradually, its flight appeared to slow. They were down to twenty miles,
then.</p>

<p>Quite abruptly the landing boat steadied. The square spot bobbed about
in the center of the astrogation screen. The engineer worked controls to
steady it.</p>

<p>The ports cleared a little. Bordman could see the ground below more
distinctly. There were patches of every tint that mineral coloring could
produce. There were vast stretches of tawny sand. A little while more,
and he could see the shadows of mountains. He made out mountain flanks
which should have had valleys between them and other mountain flanks
beyond, but they had tawny flatnesses between, instead. These, he knew,
would be the sand plateaus which had been observed on this planet and
which had only a still-disputed explanation. But he could see areas of
glistening yellow and dirty white, and splashes of pink and streaks of
ultramarine and gray and violet, and the incredible red of iron oxide
covering square miles&mdash;too much to be believed.</p>

<p>The landing-boat&rsquo;s rockets cut off. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
It coasted. Presently the horizon tilted and all the dazzling ground
below turned sedately beneath them. There came staccato instructions
from a voice-speaker, which the engineer obeyed. The landing boat swung
low&mdash;below the tips of giant mauve mountains with a sand plateau
beyond them&mdash;and its nose went up. It stalled.</p>

<p>Then the rockets roared again&mdash;and now, with air about them and after a
momentary pause, they were horribly loud&mdash;and the boat settled down and
down upon its own tail of fire.</p>

<p>There was a completely blinding mass of dust and rocket fumes which cut
off all sight of everything else. Then there was a crunching crash, and
the engineer swore peevishly to himself. He cut the rockets again.
Finally.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>Bordman found himself staring straight up, still strapped in his chair.
The boat had settled on its own tail fins, and his feet were higher than
his head, and he felt ridiculous. He saw the engineer at work
unstrapping himself. He duplicated the action, but it was absurdly
difficult to get out of the chair.</p>

<p>Aletha managed more gracefully. She didn&rsquo;t need help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said the engineer ungraciously, &ldquo;till somebody
comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they waited, using what had been chair backs for seats.</p>

<p>The engineer moved a control and the windows cleared further. They saw
the surface of Xosa II. There was no living thing in sight. The ground
itself was pebbles and small rocks and minor boulders&mdash;all apparently
tumbled from the starkly magnificent mountains to one side. There were
monstrous, many-colored cliffs and mesas, every one eaten at in the
unmistakable fashion of wind-erosion. Through a notch in the mountain
wall before them a strange, fan-shaped, frozen formation appeared. If
such a thing had been credible, Bordman would have said that it was a
flow of sand simulating a waterfall. And everywhere there was blinding
brightness and the look and feel of blistering sunshine. But there was
not one single leaf or twig or blade of grass. This was pure desert.
This was Xosa II.</p>

<p>Aletha regarded it with bright eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; she said happily. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; said Bordman, &ldquo;I never saw a place that
looked less homelike or attractive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My eyes see it differently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which was true. It was accepted, nowadays, that humankind might be one
species but was many races, and each saw the cosmos in its own fashion.
On Kalmet III there was a dense, predominantly Asiatic population which
terraced its mountainsides for agriculture and deftly mingled modern
techniques with social customs not to be found on&mdash;say&mdash;Demeter I, where
there were many red-tiled stucco towns and very many olive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
groves. In the llano planets of the Equis cluster,
Amerinds&mdash;Aletha&rsquo;s kin&mdash;zestfully rode over plains
dotted with the descendants of buffalo and antelope and cattle brought
from ancient Earth. On the oases of Rustam IV there were date palms and
riding camels and much argument about what should be substituted for the
direction of Mecca at the times for prayer, while wheat fields spanned
provinces on Canna I and highly civilized emigrants from the continent
of Africa on Earth stored jungle gums and lustrous gems in the
warehouses of their spaceport city of Timbuk.</p>

<p>So it was natural for Aletha to look at this wind-carved wilderness
otherwise than as Bordman did. Her racial kindred were the pioneers of
the stars, these days. Their heritage made them less than appreciative
of urban life. Their inborn indifference to heights made them the
steel-construction men of the cosmos, and more than two-thirds of the
landing grids in the whole galaxy had their coup-feather symbols on the
key posts. But the planet government on Algonka V was housed in a
three-thousand-foot white stone tepee, and the best horses known to men
were raised by ranchers with bronze skins and high cheekbones on the
llano planet Chagan.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-cousin.png" width="350" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, here, in the <i>Warlock&rsquo;s</i> landing boat, the engineer snorted.
A vehicle came around a cliff wall, clanking its way on those eccentric
caterwheels that new-founded colonies find so useful. The vehicle
glittered. It crawled over tumbled boulders, and flowed over fallen
scree. It came briskly toward them. The engineer snorted again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my cousin Ralph!&rdquo; said Aletha in pleased
surprise.</p>

<p>Bordman blinked and looked again. He did not quite believe his eyes. But
they told the truth. The figure controlling the ground car was
Indian&mdash;Amerind&mdash;wearing a breechcloth and thick-soled sandals and three
streamlined feathers in a band about his head. Moreover, he did not ride
in a seat. He sat astride a semi-cylindrical part of the ground car,
over which a gaily-colored blanket had been thrown.</p>

<p>The ship&rsquo;s engineer rumbled disgustedly. But then Bordman saw how
sane this method of riding was&mdash;here. The ground vehicle lurched and
swayed and rolled and pitched and tossed as it came over the uneven
ground. To sit in anything like a chair would have been foolish. A back
rest would throw one forward in a frontward lurch, and give no support
in case of a backward one. A sidewise tilt would tend to throw one out.
Riding a ground car as if in a saddle was sense!</p>

<p>But Bordman was not so sure about the costume. The engineer opened the
port and spoke hostilely out of it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know there&rsquo;s a lady in this thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Indian grinned. He waved his hand to Aletha, who pressed her
nose against a viewport. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
And just then Bordman did understand the costume or lack of it. Air
came in the open exit port. It was hot and <ins class='corr'
title="Transcriber's Note: The original showed
'dessicated'.">desiccated</ins>. It was furnace-like!</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, &rsquo;Letha,&rdquo; called the rider on the caterwheel
steed. &ldquo;Either dress for the climate or put on a heat-suit before
you come out of there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha chuckled. Bordman heard a stirring behind him. Then Aletha
climbed to the exit port and swung out. Bordman heard a dour muttering
from the engineer. Then he saw her greeting her cousin. She had slipped
out of the conventionalized Amerind outfit to which Bordman was
accustomed. Now she was clad as <ins class='corr' title="Transcriber's
Note: The original showed 'Anglo-Anglo-Saxon&mdash;girls'.">Anglo-Saxon girls</ins>
dressed for beaches on the cool-temperature planets.</p>

<p>For a moment Bordman thought of sunstroke, with his own eyes dazzled by
the still-partly-filtered sunlight. But Aletha&rsquo;s Amerind coloring
was perfectly suited to sunshine even of this intensity. Wind blowing
upon her body would cool her skin. Her thick, straight black hair was at
least as good protection against sunstroke as a heat-helmet. She might
feel hot, but she would be perfectly safe. She wouldn&rsquo;t even
sunburn. But he, Bordman&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He grimly stripped to underwear and put on the heat-suit from his bag.
He filled its canteens from the boat&rsquo;s water tank. He turned on
the tiny, battery-powered motors. The suit ballooned out. It was
intended for short periods of intolerable heat. The motors kept it
inflated&mdash;away from his skin&mdash;and cooled its interior by the evaporation
of sweat plus water from its canteen tanks. It was a miniature
air-conditioning system for one man, and it should enable him to endure
temperatures otherwise lethal to someone with his skin and coloring. But
it would use a lot of water.</p>

<p>He climbed to the exit port and went clumsily down the exterior ladder
to the tail fin. He adjusted his goggles. He went over to the chattering
young Indians, young man and girl. He held out his gloved hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bordman,&rdquo; he said painfully. &ldquo;Here to make
a degree-of-completion survey. What&rsquo;s wrong that we had to land by
boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha&rsquo;s cousin shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ralph Redfeather,&rdquo; he said, introducing himself.
&ldquo;Project engineer. About everything&rsquo;s wrong. Our landing
grid&rsquo;s gone. We couldn&rsquo;t contact your ship in time to warn
it off. It was in our gravity field before it answered, and its Lawlor
drive couldn&rsquo;t take it away&mdash;not working because of the field. Our
power, of course, went with the landing grid. The ship you came in
can&rsquo;t get back, and we can&rsquo;t send a distress message
anywhere, and our best estimate is that the colony will be wiped
out&mdash;thirst and starvation&mdash;in six months. I&rsquo;m sorry you and
Aletha have to be included.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he turned to Aletha and said amiably:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Mike Thundercloud and Sally Whitehorse and the gang
in general, &rsquo;Letha?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>The <i>Warlock</i> rolled on in her newly-established orbit about Xosa II.
The landing boat was aground, having removed the two passengers. It
would come back. Nobody on the ship wanted to stay aground, because they
knew the conditions and the situation below&mdash;unbearable heat and the
complete absence of hope. But nobody had anything to do! The ship had
been maintained in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
standard operating condition during its two-months&rsquo; voyage from
Trent to here. No repairs or overhaulings were needed. There was no
maintenance-work to speak of. There would be only stand-by watches until
something happened. There would be nothing to do on those watches. There
would be off-watch time for twenty-one out of every twenty-four hours,
and no purposeful activity to fill even half an hour of it. In a matter
of&mdash;probably&mdash;years, the <i>Warlock</i> should receive aid. She
might be towed out of her orbit to space in which the Lawlor drive could
function, or the crew might simply be taken off. But meanwhile, those on
board were as completely frustrated as the colony. They could not do
anything at all to help themselves.</p>

<p>In one fashion the crewmen were worse off than the colonists. The
colonists had at least the colorful prospect of death before them. They
could prepare for it in their several ways. But the members of the
<i>Warlock</i>&rsquo;s crew had nothing ahead but tedium.</p>

<p>The skipper faced the future with extreme, grim distaste.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>The ride to the colony was torment. Aletha rode behind her cousin on the
saddle-blanket, and apparently suffered little if at all. But Bordman
could only ride in the ground-car&rsquo;s cargo space, along with the
sack of mail from the ship. The ground was unbelievably rough and the
jolting intolerable. The heat was literally murderous. In the metal
cargo space, the temperature reached a hundred and sixty degrees in the
sunshine&mdash;and given enough time, food will cook in no more heat than
that. Of course a man has been known to enter an oven and stay there
while a roast was cooked, and to come out alive. But the oven
wasn&rsquo;t throwing him violently about or bringing
sun-heated&mdash;blue-white-sun heated&mdash;metal to press his heat-suit against
him.</p>

<p>The suit did make survival possible, but that was all. The contents of
its canteens gave out just before arrival, and for a short time Bordman
had only sweat for his suit to work with. It kept him alive by forced
ventilation, but he arrived in a state of collapse. He drank the iced
salt water they gave him and went to bed. He&rsquo;d get back his
strength with a proper sodium level in his blood. But he slept for
twelve hours straight.</p>

<p>When he got up, he was physically normal again, but abysmally ashamed.
It did no good to remind himself that Xosa II was rated minimum-comfort
class D&mdash;a blue-white sun and a mean temperature of one hundred and ten
degrees. Africans could take such a climate&mdash;with night-relief quarters.
Amerinds could do steel construction work in the open, protected only by
insulated shoes and gloves. But Bordman could not venture out-of-doors
except in a heat-suit. He couldn&rsquo;t stay long then. It was not a
weakness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
It was a matter of genetics. But he was ashamed.</p>

<p>Aletha nodded to him when he found the Project Engineer&rsquo;s office.
It occupied one of the hulls in which colony-establishment materials had
been lowered by rocket power. There were forty of the hulls, and they
had been emptied and arranged for inter-communication in three separate
communities, so that an individual could change his quarters and
ordinary associates from time to time and colony fever&mdash;frantic
irritation with one&rsquo;s companions&mdash;was minimized.</p>

<p>Aletha sat at a desk, busily making notes from a loose leaf volume
before her. The wall behind the desk was fairly lined with similar
volumes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made a spectacle of myself!&rdquo; said Bordman, bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; Aletha assured him. &ldquo;It could happen to
anybody. I wouldn&rsquo;t do too well on Timbuk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no answer to that. Timbuk was essentially a jungle planet,
barely emerging from the carboniferous stage. Its colonists thrived
because their ancestors had lived on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea,
on Earth. But Anglos did not find its climate healthful, nor would many
other races. Amerinds died there quicker than most.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ralph&rsquo;s on the way here now,&rdquo; added Aletha. &ldquo;He
and Dr. Chuka were out picking a place to leave the records. The sand
dunes here are terrible, you know. When an explorer-ship does come to
find out what&rsquo;s happened to us, these buildings could be covered
up completely. Any place could be. It isn&rsquo;t easy to pick a
record-cache that&rsquo;s quite sure to be found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When,&rdquo; said Bordman skeptically, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
nobody left alive to point it out. Is that it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; agreed Aletha. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty
bad all around. I didn&rsquo;t plan to die just yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice was perfectly normal. Bordman snorted. As a senior Colonial
Survey officer, he&rsquo;d been around. But he&rsquo;d never yet known a
human colony to be extinguished when it was properly equipped and after
a proper pre-settlement survey. He&rsquo;d seen panic, but never real
cause for a matter-of-fact acceptance of doom.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>There was a clanking noise outside the hulk which was the Project
Engineer&rsquo;s headquarters. Bordman couldn&rsquo;t see clearly
through the filtered ports. He reached over and opened a door. The
brightness outside struck his eyes like a blow. He blinked them shut
instantly and turned away. But he&rsquo;d seen a glistening, caterwheel
ground car stopping not far from the doorway.</p>

<p>He stood wiping tears from his light-dazzled eyes as footsteps sounded
outside. Aletha&rsquo;s cousin came in, followed by a huge man with
remarkably dark skin. The dark man wore eyeglasses with a curiously
thick, corklike nosepiece to insulate the necessary metal of the frame
from his skin. It would blister if it touched bare flesh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
&ldquo;This is Dr. Chuka,&rdquo; said Redfeather pleasantly, &ldquo;Mr.
Bordman. Dr. Chuka&rsquo;s the director of mining and mineralogy
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman shook hands with the ebony-skinned man. He grinned, showing
startlingly white teeth. Then he began to shiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a freeze-box in here,&rdquo; he said in a deep
voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a robe and be with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He vanished through a doorway, his teeth chattering audibly.
Aletha&rsquo;s cousin took half a dozen deliberate deep breaths and
grimaced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could shiver myself,&rdquo; he admitted &ldquo;but
Chuka&rsquo;s really acclimated to Xosa. He was raised on Timbuk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman said curtly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I collapsed on landing. It won&rsquo;t happen
again. I came here to do a degree-of-completion survey that should open
the colony to normal commerce, let the colonists&rsquo; families move
in, tourists, and so on. But I was landed by boat instead of normally,
and I am told the colony is doomed. I would like an official statement
of the degree of completion of the colony&rsquo;s facilities and an
explanation of the unusual points I have just mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian blinked at him. Then he smiled faintly. The dark man came
back, zipping up an indoor warmth-garment. Redfeather dryly brought him
up to date by repeating what Bordman had just said. Chuka grinned and
sprawled comfortably in a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; he remarked humorously, in that
astonishingly deep-toned voice of his, &ldquo;sand got in our hair. And
our colony. And the landing grid. There&rsquo;s a lot of sand on Xosa.
Wouldn&rsquo;t you say that was the trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian said with elaborate gravity:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course wind had something to do with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman fumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you know,&rdquo; he said fretfully, &ldquo;that as a
senior Colonial Survey officer, I have authority to give any orders
needed for my work. I give one now. I want to see the landing grid&mdash;if
it is still standing. I take it that it didn&rsquo;t fall down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Redfeather flushed beneath the bronze pigment of his skin. It would be
hard to offend a steelman more than to suggest that his work did not
stand up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; he said politely, &ldquo;that it did not
fall down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your estimate of its degree of completion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighty per cent,&rdquo; said Redfeather formally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve stopped work on it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work on it has been stopped,&rdquo; agreed the Indian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even though the colony can receive no more supplies until it is
completed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Redfeather without expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I issue a formal order that I be taken to the landing-grid
site immediately,&rdquo; said Bordman angrily. &ldquo;I want to see what
sort of incompetence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
is responsible! Will you arrange it&mdash;at once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Redfeather said in a completely emotionless voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to see the site of the landing grid. Very good.
Immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned and walked out into the incredible, blinding sunshine. Bordman
blinked at the momentary blast of light, and then began to pace up and
down the office. He fumed. He was still ashamed of his collapse from the
heat during the travel from the landed rocket-boat to the colony.
Therefore he was touchy and irritable. But the order he had given was
strictly justifiable.</p>

<p>He heard a small noise. He whirled. Dr. Chuka, huge and black and
spectacled, rocked back and forth in his seat, suppressing laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what the devil does that mean?&rdquo; demanded Bordman
suspiciously. &ldquo;It certainly isn&rsquo;t ridiculous to ask to see
the structure on which the life of the colony finally depends!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not ridiculous,&rdquo; said Dr. Chuka.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;hilarious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He boomed laughter in the office with the rounded ceiling of a remade
robot hull. Aletha smiled with him, though her eyes were grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better put on a heat-suit,&rdquo; she said to
Bordman.</p>

<p>He fumed again, tempted to defy all common sense because its dictates
were not the same for everybody. But he marched away, back to the
cubbyhole in which he had awakened. Angrily, he donned the heat-suit
that had not protected him adequately before, but had certainly saved
his life. He filled the canteens topping full&mdash;he suspected he
hadn&rsquo;t done so the last time. He went back to the Project
Engineer&rsquo;s office with a feeling of being burdened and absurd.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/illus-talk.png" width="374" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Out a filter-window, he saw that men with skins as dark as Dr.
Chuka&rsquo;s were at work on a ground car. They were equipping it with
a sunshade and curious shields like wings. Somebody pushed a sort of
caterwheel handtruck toward it. They put big, heavy tanks into its cargo
space. Dr. Chuka had disappeared, but Aletha was back at work making
notes from the loose-leaf volume on the desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; asked Bordman with some irony, &ldquo;what your
work happens to be just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you knew,&rdquo; she said in surprise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
here for the Amerind Historical Society. I can certify coups. I&rsquo;m
taking coup-records for the Society. They&rsquo;ll go in the
record-cache Ralph and Dr. Chuka are arranging, so no matter what
happens to the colony, the record of the coups won&rsquo;t be
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coups?&rdquo; demanded Bordman. He knew that Amerinds painted
feathers on the key-posts of steel structures they&rsquo;d built, and he
knew that the posting of such &ldquo;coup-marks&rdquo; was a cherished
privilege and undoubtedly a survival or revival of some American Indian
tradition <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
back on Earth. But he did not know what they meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coups,&rdquo; repeated Aletha matter-of-factly. &ldquo;Ralph
wears three eagle-feathers. You saw them. He has three coups. Pinions,
too! He built the landing grids on Norlath and&mdash;Oh, you don&rsquo;t
know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted Bordman, his temper not of the
best because of what seemed unnecessary condescensions on Xosa II.</p>

<p>Aletha looked surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the old days,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;back on Earth, if a
man scalped an enemy, he counted coup. The first to strike an enemy in a
battle counted coup, too&mdash;a lesser one. Nowadays a man counts coups for
different things, but Ralph&rsquo;s three eagle-feathers mean he&rsquo;s
entitled to as much respect as a warrior in the old days who, three
separate times, had killed and scalped an enemy warrior in the middle of
his own camp. And he is, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman grunted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barbarous, I&rsquo;d say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said Aletha. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s something
to be proud of&mdash;and one doesn&rsquo;t count coup for making a lot of
money!&rdquo; Then she paused and said curtly: &ldquo;The word
&lsquo;snobbish&rsquo; fits it better than &lsquo;barbarous.&rsquo; We
are snobs! But when the head of a clan stands up in Council in the Big
Tepee on Algonka, representing his clan, and men have to carry the ends
of the feather headdress with all the coups the members of his clan have
earned&mdash;why one is proud to belong to that clan!&rdquo; She added
defiantly, &ldquo;Even watching it on a vision-screen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Chuka opened the outer door. Blinding light poured in. He did not
enter&mdash;and his body glistened with sweat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready for you, Mr. Bordman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman adjusted his goggles and turned on the motors of his heat-suit.
He went out the door.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>The heat and light outside were oppressive. He darkened the goggles
again and made his way heavily to the waiting, now-shaded ground car. He
noted that there were other changes beside the sunshade. The cover-deck
of the cargo space was gone, and there were cylindrical riding seats
like saddles in the back. The odd lower shields reached out sidewise
from the body, barely above the caterwheels. He could not make out their
purpose and irritably failed to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; said Redfeather coldly. &ldquo;Dr.
Chuka&rsquo;s coming with us. If you&rsquo;ll get in here,
please&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman climbed awkwardly into the boxlike back of the car. He bestrode
one of the cylindrical arrangements. With a saddle on it, it would
undoubtedly have been a comfortable way to cover impossibly bad terrain
in a mechanical carrier. He waited. About him there were the squatty
hulls of the space-barges which had been towed here by a colony ship,
each one once equipped with rockets for landing. Emptied of their
cargoes, they had been huddled together into the three separate,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
adjoining communities. There were separate living quarters and mess
halls and recreation rooms for each, and any colonist lived in the
community of his choice and shifted at pleasure, or visited, or remained
solitary. For mental health a man has to be assured of his free will,
and over-regimentation is deadly in any society. With men
psychologically suited to colonize, it is fatal.</p>

<p>Above&mdash;but at a distance, now&mdash;there was a monstrous scarp of mountains,
colored in glaring and unnatural tints. Immediately about there was raw
rock. But it was peculiarly smooth, as if sand grains had rubbed over it
for uncountable aeons and carefully worn away every trace of unevenness.
Half a mile to the left, dunes began and went away to the horizon. The
nearer ones were small, but they gained in size with distance from the
mountains&mdash;which evidently affected the surface-winds hereabouts&mdash;and
the edge of seeing was visibly not a straight line. The dunes yonder
must be gigantic. But of course on a world the size of ancient Earth,
and which was waterless save for snow-patches at its poles, the size to
which sand dunes could grow had no limit. The surface of Xosa II was a
sea of sand, on which islands and small continents of wind-swept rock
were merely minor features.</p>

<p>Dr. Chuka adjusted a small metal object in his hand. It had a tube
dangling from it. He climbed into the cargo space and fastened it to one
of the two tanks previously loaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you,&rdquo; he told Bordman. &ldquo;Those tanks are full of
compressed air at rather high pressure&mdash;a couple of thousand pounds.
Here&rsquo;s a reduction-valve with an adiabatic expansion feature, to
supply extra air to your heat-suit. It will be pretty cold, expanding
from so high a pressure. Bring down the temperature a little
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman again felt humiliated. Chuka and Redfeather, because of their
races, were able to move about nine-tenths naked in the open air on this
planet, and they thrived. But he needed a special refrigerated costume
to endure the heat. More, they provided him with sunshades and
refrigerated air that they did not need for themselves. They were
thoughtful of him. He was as much out of his element, where they fitted
perfectly, as he would have been making a degree-of-completion survey on
an underwater project. He had to wear what was practically a diving suit
and use a special air supply to survive!</p>

<p>He choked down the irritation his own inadequacy produced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we can go now,&rdquo; he said as coldly as he could.</p>

<p>Aletha&rsquo;s cousin mounted the control-saddle&mdash;though it was no more
than a blanket&mdash;and Dr. Chuka mounted beside Bordman. The ground car got
under way. It headed for the mountains.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>The smoothness of the rock was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
deceptive. The caterwheel car lurched and bumped and swayed and rocked.
It rolled and dipped and wallowed. Nobody could have remained in a
normal seat on such terrain, but Bordman felt hopelessly undignified
riding what amounted to a hobbyhorse. Under the sunshade it was
infuriatingly like a horse on a <ins class='corr' title="Transcriber's
Note: The original showed 'carrousel'.">carousel</ins>. That there were three
of them together made it look even more foolish. He stared about him,
trying to take his mind from his own absurdity. His goggles made the
light endurable, but he felt ashamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those side-fins,&rdquo; said Chuka&rsquo;s deep voice pleasantly,
&ldquo;the bottom ones, make things better for you. The shade overhead
cuts off direct sunlight, and they cut off the reflected glare. It would
blister your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
skin even if the sun never touched you directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman did not answer. The caterwheel car went on. It came to a patch
of sand&mdash;tawny sand, heavily mineralized. There was a dune here. Not a
big one for Xosa II. It was no more than a hundred feet high. But they
went up its leeward, steeply slanting side. All the planet seemed to
tilt insanely as the caterwheels spun. They reached the dune&rsquo;s
crest, where it tended to curl over and break like a water-comber, and
here the wheels struggled with sand precariously ready to fall, and
Bordman had a sudden perception of the sands of Xosa II as the oceans
that they really were. The dunes were waves which moved with infinite
slowness, but the irresistible force of storm-seas. Nothing could resist
them. Nothing!</p>

<p>They traveled over similar dunes for two miles. Then they began to climb
the approaches to the mountains. And Bordman saw for the second
time&mdash;the first had been through the ports of the landing-boat&mdash;where
there was a notch in the mountain wall and sand had flowed out of it
like a waterfall, making a beautifully symmetrical cone-shaped heap
against the lower cliffs. There were many such falls. There was one
place where there was a sand-cascade. Sand had poured over a series of
rocky steps, piling up on each in turn to its very edge, and then
spilling again to the next.</p>

<p>They went up a crazily slanting spur of stone, whose sides were too
steep for sand to lodge on, and whose narrow crest had a bare thin
coating of powder.</p>

<p>The landscape looked like a nightmare. As the car went on, wabbling and
lurching and dipping on its way, the heights on either side made Bordman
tend to dizziness. The coloring was impossible. The aridness, the <ins
class='corr' title="Transcriber's Note: The original showed
'dessication'.">desiccation</ins>, the lifelessness of everything about was
somehow shocking. Bordman found himself straining his eyes for the
merest, scrubbiest of bushes and for however stunted and isolated a wisp
of grass.</p>

<p>The journey went on for an hour. Then there came a straining climb up a
now-windswept ridge of eroded rock, and the attainment of its highest
point. The ground car went onward for a hundred yards and stopped.</p>

<p>They had reached the top of the mountain range, and there was
doubtlessly another range beyond. But they could not see it. Here, at
the place to which they had climbed so effortfully, there were no more
rocks. There was no valley. There was no descending slope. There was
sand. This was one of the sand plateaus which were a unique feature of
Xosa II. And Bordman knew, now, that the disputed explanation was the
true one.</p>

<p>Winds, blowing over the mountains, carried sand as on other worlds they
carried moisture and pollen and seeds and rain. Where two mountain
ranges ran across the course of long-blowing winds, the winds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
eddied above the valley between. They dropped sand into it. The
equivalent of trade winds, Bordman considered, in time would fill a
valley to the mountain tops, just as trade winds provide moisture in
equal quantity on other worlds, and civilizations have been built upon
it. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-grid.png" width="500" height="332" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Bordman challengingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the site of the landing grid,&rdquo; said Redfeather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the Indian dryly. &ldquo;A few months ago there
was a valley here. The landing grid had eighteen hundred feet of height
built. There was to be four hundred feet more&mdash;the lighter top
construction justifies my figure of eighty per cent completion. Then
there was a storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was hot. Horribly, terribly hot, even here on a plateau at
mountaintop height. Dr. Chuka looked at Bordman&rsquo;s face and bent
down in the vehicle. He turned a stopcock on one of the air tanks
brought for Bordman&rsquo;s necessity. Immediately Bordman felt cooler.
His skin was dry, of course. The circulated air dried sweat as fast as
it appeared. But he had the dazed, feverish feeling of a man in an
artificial-fever box. He&rsquo;d been fighting it for some time. Now the
coolness of the expanded air was almost deliriously refreshing.</p>

<p>Dr. Chuka produced a canteen. Bordman drank thirstily. The water was
slightly salted to replace salt lost in sweat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A storm, eh?&rdquo; asked Bordman, after a time of contemplation
of his inner sensations as well as the scene of disaster before him.
There&rsquo;d be some hundreds of millions of tons of sand in even a
section of this plateau. It was unthinkable that it could be removed
except by a long-time sweep of changed trade winds along the length of
the valley. &ldquo;But what has a storm to do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a sandstorm,&rdquo; said Redfeather coldly.
&ldquo;Probably there was a sunspot flare-up. We don&rsquo;t know. But
the pre-colonization survey spoke of sandstorms. The survey team even
made estimates of sandfall in various places as so many inches per year.
Here all storms drop sand instead of rain. But there must have been a
sunspot flare because this storm blew for&rdquo;&mdash;his voice went flat
and deliberate because it was stating the unbelievable&mdash;&ldquo;for two
months. We did not see the sun in all that time. And we couldn&rsquo;t
work, naturally. The sand would flay a man&rsquo;s skin off his body in
minutes. So we waited it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it ended, there was this sand plateau where the survey had
ordered the landing grid to be built. The grid was under it. It is under
it. The top of eighteen hundred feet of steel is still buried two
hundred feet down in the sand you see. Our unfabricated building-steel
is piled ready for erection&mdash;under two thousand feet of sand.
Without anything but stored power it is hardly
practical&rdquo;&mdash;Redfeather&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
tone was sardonic&mdash;&ldquo;for us to try to dig it out. There are
hundreds of millions of tons of stuff to be moved. If we could get the
sand away, we could finish the grid. If we could finish the grid,
we&rsquo;d have power enough to get the sand away&mdash;in a few years,
and if we could replace the machinery that wore out handling it. And if
there wasn&rsquo;t another sandstorm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused. Bordman took deep breaths of the cooler air. He could think
more clearly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will accept photographs,&rdquo; said Redfeather politely,
&ldquo;you can check that we actually did the work.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>Bordman saw the implications. The colony had been formed of Amerinds for
the steel work and Africans for the labor the Amerinds were congenitally
averse to&mdash;the handling of complex mining-machinery underground and the
control of modern high-speed smelting operations. Both races could
endure this climate and work in it&mdash;provided that they had cooled
sleeping quarters. But they had to have power. Power not only to work
with, but to live by. The air-cooling machinery that made sleep possible
also condensed from the cooled air the minute trace of water vapor it
contained and that they needed for drink. But without power they would
thirst. Without the landing grid and the power it took from the
ionosphere, they could not receive supplies from the rest of the
universe. So they would starve.</p>

<p>And the <i>Warlock</i>, now in orbit somewhere overhead, was well within the
planet&rsquo;s gravitational field and could not use its Lawlor drive to
escape with news of their predicament. In the normal course of events it
would be years before a colony ship capable of landing or blasting out
of a planetary gravitational field by rocket-power was dispatched to
find out why there was no news from Xosa II. There was no such thing as
interstellar signaling, of course. Ships themselves travel faster than
any signal that could be sent, and distances were so great that mere
communication took enormous lengths of time. A letter sent to Earth from
the Rim even now took ten years to make the journey, and another ten for
a reply. Even the much shorter distances involved in Xosa II&rsquo;s
predicament still ruled out all hope. The colony was strictly on its
own.</p>

<p>Bordman said heavily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept the photographs. I even accept the statement
that the colony will die. I will prepare my report for the cache Aletha
tells me you&rsquo;re preparing. And I apologize for any affront I may
have offered you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Chuka nodded approvingly. He regarded Bordman with benign warmth.
Ralph Redfeather said cordially enough:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfectly all right. No harm done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Bordman shortly, &ldquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
since I have authority to give any orders needed for my work, I want to
survey the steps you&rsquo;ve taken to carry out those parts of your
instructions dealing with emergencies. I want to see right away what
you&rsquo;ve done to beat this state of things. I know they can&rsquo;t
be beaten, but I intend to leave a report on what you&rsquo;ve
tried!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>The <i>Warlock</i> swung in emptiness around the planet Xosa II. It was
barely five thousand miles above the surface, so the mottled terrain of
the dry world flowed swiftly and perpetually beneath it. It did not seem
beneath, of course. It simply seemed out&mdash;away&mdash;removed from the ship.
And in the ship&rsquo;s hull there was artificial gravity, and light,
and there were the humming sounds of fans which kept the air in motion
and flowing through the air apparatus. Also there was food, and adequate
water, and the temperature was admirably controlled. But nothing
happened. Moreover, nothing could be expected to happen. There were
eight men in the crew, and they were accustomed to space-voyages which
lasted from one month to three. But they had traveled a good two months
from their last port. They had exhausted the visireels, playing them
over and over until they were intolerable. They had read and reread all
the bookreels they could bear. On previous voyages they had played chess
and similar games until it was completely predictable who would beat
whom in every possible contest.</p>

<p>Now they viewed the future with bitterness. The ship could not land,
because there was no landing grid in operation on the planet below them.
They could not depart, because the Lawlor drive simply does not work
within five diameters of an Earth-gravity planet. Space is warped only
infinitesimally by so thin a field, but a Lawlor drive needs almost
perfectly unstressed emptiness if it is to take hold. They did not have
fuel enough to blast out the necessary thirty-odd thousand miles against
gravity. The same consideration made their lifeboats useless. They could
not escape by rocket-power and their Lawlor drives, also, were
ineffective.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Warlock</i> was bored. The worst of the boredom was that
it promised to last without limit. They had food and water and physical
comfort, but they were exactly in the situation of men sentenced to
prison for an unknown but enormous length of time. There was no escape.
There could be no alleviation. The prospect invited frenzy by
anticipation.</p>

<p>A fist fight broke out in the crew&rsquo;s quarters within two hours
after the <i>Warlock</i> had established its orbit&mdash;as a first reaction to
their catastrophe. The skipper went through the ship and painstakingly
confiscated every weapon. He locked them up. He, himself, already felt
the nagging effect of jangling nerves. There was nothing to do. He
didn&rsquo;t know when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
there would ever be anything to do. It was a condition to produce
hysteria.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>There was night. Outside and above the colony there were uncountable
myriads of stars. They were not the stars of Earth, of course, but
Bordman had never been on Earth. He was used to unfamiliar
constellations. He stared out a port at the sky, and noted that there
were no moons. He remembered, when he thought, that Xosa II had no
moons. There was a rustling of paper behind him. Aletha Redfeather
turned a page in a loose-leaf volume and painstakingly made a note. The
wall behind her held many more such books. From them could be extracted
the detailed history of every bit of work that had been done by the
colony-preparation crews. Separate, tersely-phrased items could be
assembled to make a record of individual men.</p>

<p>There had been incredible hardships, at first. There were heroic feats.
There had been an attempt to ferry water supplies down from the pole by
aircraft. It was not practical, even to build up a reserve of fluid.
Winds carried sand particles here as on other worlds they carried
moisture. Aircraft were abraded as they flew. The last working flier
made a forced landing five hundred miles from the colony. A caterwheel
expedition went out and brought the crew in. The caterwheel trucks were
armored with silicone plastic, resistant to abrasion, but when they got
back they had to be scrapped. There had been men lost in sudden
sand-squalls, and heroic searches for them, and once or twice rescues.
There had been cave-ins in the mines. There had been accidents. There
had been magnificent feats of endurance and achievement.</p>

<p>Bordman went to the door of the hull which was Ralph Redfeather&rsquo;s
Project Engineer office. He opened it. He stepped outside.</p>

<p>It was like stepping into an oven. The sand was still hot from the
sunshine just ended. The air was so utterly dry that Bordman instantly
felt it sucking at the moisture of his nasal passages. In ten seconds
his feet&mdash;clad in indoor footwear&mdash;were uncomfortably hot. In twenty the
soles of his feet felt as if they were blistering. He would die of the
heat at night, here! Perhaps he could endure the outside near dawn, but
he raged a little. Here where Amerinds and Africans lived and throve, he
could live unprotected for no more than an hour or two&mdash;and that at one
special time of the planet&rsquo;s rotation!</p>

<p>He went back in, ashamed of the discomfort of his feet and angrily
letting them feel scorched rather than admit to it.</p>

<p>Aletha turned another page.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, here!&rdquo; said Bordman angrily. &ldquo;No matter what
you say, you&rsquo;re going to go back on the <i>Warlock</i>
before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll worry about that when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
time comes. But I think not. I&rsquo;d rather stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the present, perhaps,&rdquo; snapped Bordman. &ldquo;But
before things get too bad you go back to the ship! They&rsquo;ve rocket
fuel enough for half a dozen landings of the landing boat. They can lift
you out of here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why leave here to board a <ins class='corr' title="Transcriber's
Note: The original showed 'derelect'.">derelict</ins>? The <i>Warlock</i>&rsquo;s
practically that. What&rsquo;s your honest estimate of the time before a
ship equipped to help us gets here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman would not answer. He&rsquo;d done some figuring. It had been a
two-month journey from Trent&mdash;the nearest Survey base&mdash;to here. The
<i>Warlock</i> had been expected to remain aground until the smelter it
brought could load it with pig metal. Which could be as little as two
weeks, but would surprise nobody if it was two months instead. So the
ship would not be considered due back on Trent for four months. It would
not be considered overdue for at least two more. It would be six months
before anybody seriously wondered why it wasn&rsquo;t back with its
cargo. There&rsquo;d be a wait for lifeboats to come in, should there
have been a mishap in space. There&rsquo;d eventually be a report of
noncommunication to the Colony Survey headquarters on Canna III. But it
would take three months for that report to be received, and six more for
a confirmation&mdash;even if ships made the voyages exactly at the most
favorable intervals&mdash;and then there should at least be a complaint from
the colony. There were lifeboats aground on Xosa II, for emergency
communication, and if a lifeboat didn&rsquo;t bring news of a planetary
crisis, no crisis would be considered to exist. Nobody could imagine a
landing grid failing!</p>

<p>Maybe in a year somebody would think that maybe somebody ought to ask
around about Xosa II. It would be much longer before somebody put a note
on somebody else&rsquo;s desk that would suggest that when, or if, a
suitable ship passed near Xosa II, or if one should be available for the
inquiry, it might be worth while to have the noncommunication from the
planet looked into. Actually, to guess at three years before another
ship arrived would be the most optimistic of estimates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a civilian,&rdquo; said Bordman shortly. &ldquo;When
the food and water run low, you go back to the ship. You&rsquo;ll at
least be alive when somebody does come to see what&rsquo;s the matter
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha said mildly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;d rather not be alive. Will you go back to the
ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman flushed. He wouldn&rsquo;t. But he said doggedly;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can order you sent on board, and your cousin will carry out the
order!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it very much,&rdquo; said Aletha pleasantly.</p>

<p>She returned to her task.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>There were crunching footsteps outside the hulk. Bordman winced a
little. With insulated sandals, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was normal for these colonists to move from one part of the colony to
another in the open, even by daylight. He, Bordman, couldn&rsquo;t take
out-of-doors at night! His lips twisted bitterly.</p>

<p>Men came in. There were dark men with rippling muscles under glistening
skin, and bronze Amerinds with coarse straight hair. Ralph Redfeather
was with them. Dr. Chuka came in last of all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Redfeather. &ldquo;These are our
foremen. Among us, I think we can answer any questions you want to
ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made introductions. Bordman didn&rsquo;t try to remember the names.
Abeokuta and Northwind and Sutata and Tallgrass and T&rsquo;ckka and
Spottedhorse and Lewanika&mdash;&mdash; They were names which in combination would
only be found in a very raw, new colony. But the men who crowded into
the office were wholly at ease, in their own minds as well as in the
presence of a senior Colonial Survey officer. They nodded as they were
named, and the nearest shook hands. Bordman knew that he&rsquo;d have
liked their looks under other circumstances. But he was humiliated by
the conditions on this planet. They were not. They were apparently only
sentenced to death by them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to leave a report,&rdquo; said Bordman curtly&mdash;and he was
somehow astonished to know that he did expect to leave a report rather
than make one; he accepted the hopelessness of the colony&rsquo;s
future&mdash;&ldquo;on the degree-of-completion of the work here. But since
there&rsquo;s an emergency, I have also to leave a report on the
measures taken to meet it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The report would be futile, of course. As futile as the coup-records
Aletha was compiling, which would be read only after everybody on the
planet was dead. But Bordman knew he&rsquo;d write it. It was
unthinkable that he shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Redfeather tells me,&rdquo; he added, again curtly, &ldquo;that
the power in storage can be used to cool the colony buildings&mdash;and
therefore condense drinking water from the air&mdash;for just about six
months. There is food for about six months. If one lets the buildings
warm up a little, to stretch the fuel, there won&rsquo;t be enough water
to drink. Go on half rations to stretch the food, and there won&rsquo;t
be enough water to last and the power will give out anyhow. No profit
there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were nods. The matter had been thrashed out long before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s food in the <i>Warlock</i> overhead,&rdquo; Bordman went
on coldly, &ldquo;but they can&rsquo;t use the landing boat more than a
few times. It can&rsquo;t use ship fuel. No refrigeration to hold it
stable. They couldn&rsquo;t land more than a ton of supplies all told.
There are five hundred of us here. No help there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked from one to another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we live comfortably,&rdquo; he told them with irony,
&ldquo;until our food and water and minimum night-comfort run out
together. Anything we do to try to stretch anything is useless because
of what happens to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
something else. Redfeather tells me you accept the situation. What are
you doing&mdash;since you accept it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Chuka said amiably:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve picked a storage place for our records, and our
miners are blasting out space in which to put away the record of our
actions to the last possible moment. It will be sandproof. Our mechanics
are building a broadcast unit we&rsquo;ll spare a tiny bit of fuel for.
It will run twenty-odd years, broadcasting directions so it can be found
regardless of how the terrain is changed by drifting sand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Bordman, &ldquo;the fact that nobody will be
here to give directions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chuka added benignly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing a great deal of singing, too. My people are ...
ah ... religious. When we are ... ah ... no longer here ... there have
been boastings that there&rsquo;ll be a well-practiced choir ready to go
to work in the next world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>White teeth showed in grins. Bordman was almost envious of men who could
grin at such a thought. But he went on grimly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I understand that athletics have also been much
practiced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Redfeather said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been time for it. Climbing teams have counted coup
on all the worst mountains within three hundred miles. There&rsquo;s
been a new record set for the javelin, adjusted for gravity constant,
and Johnny Cornstalk did a hundred yards in eight point four seconds.
Aletha has the records and has certified them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very useful!&rdquo; said Bordman sardonically. Then he disliked
himself for saying it even before the bronze-skinned men&rsquo;s faces
grew studiedly impassive.</p>

<p>Chuka waved his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, Ralph! Lewanika&rsquo;s nephew will beat that within a
week!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman was ashamed again because Chuka had spoken to cover up his own
ill-nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take it back!&rdquo; he said irritably. &ldquo;What I said was
uncalled for. I shouldn&rsquo;t have said it! But I came here to do a
completion survey and what you&rsquo;ve been giving me is material for
an estimate of morale! It&rsquo;s not my line! I&rsquo;m a technician,
first and foremost! We&rsquo;re faced with a technical problem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha spoke suddenly from behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But these are men, first and foremost, Mr. Bordman. And
they&rsquo;re faced with a very human problem&mdash;how to die well. They
seem to be rather good at it, so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman ground his teeth. He was again humiliated. In his own fashion he
was attempting the same thing. But just as he was genetically not
qualified to endure the climate of this planet, he was not prepared for
a fatalistic or pious acceptance of disaster. Amerind and African,
alike, these men instinctively held to their own ideas of what the
dignity of a man called upon him to do when he could not do anything but
die. But Bordman&rsquo;s idea of his human dignity required him to be
still fighting: still scratching at the eyes of fate or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
destiny when he was slain. It was in his blood or genes or the result
of training. He simply could not, with self-respect, accept any physical
situation as hopeless even when his mind assured him that it was.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; he said coldly, &ldquo;but still I have to think
in technical terms. You might say that we are going to die because we
cannot land the <i>Warlock</i> with food and equipment. We cannot land the
<i>Warlock</i> because we have no landing grid. We have no landing grid
because it and all the material to complete it is buried under millions
of tons of sand. We cannot make a new light-supply-ship type of landing
grid because we have no smelter to make beams, nor power to run it if we
had, yet if we had the beams we could get the power to run the smelter
we haven&rsquo;t got to make the beams. And we have no smelter, hence no
beams, no power, no prospect of food or help because we can&rsquo;t land
the <i>Warlock</i>. It is strictly a circular problem. Break it at any point
and all of it is solved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the dark men muttered something under his breath to those near
him. There were chuckles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like Mr. Woodchuck,&rdquo; explained the man, when
Bordman&rsquo;s eyes fell on him. &ldquo;When I was a little boy there
was a story like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman said icily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The problem of coolness and water and food is the same sort of
problem. In six months we could raise food&mdash;if we had power to condense
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
moisture. We&rsquo;ve chemicals for hydroponics&mdash;if we could keep
the plants from roasting as they grew. Refrigeration and water and food
are practically another circular problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha said tentatively:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bordman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned, annoyed. Aletha said almost apologetically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Chagan there was a&mdash;you might call it a woman&rsquo;s coup
given to a woman I know. Her husband raises horses. He&rsquo;s mad about
them. And they live in a sort of home on caterwheels out on the
plains&mdash;the llanos. Sometimes they&rsquo;re months away from a
settlement. And she loves ice cream and refrigeration isn&rsquo;t too
simple. But she has a Doctorate in Human History. So she had her husband
make an insulated tray on the roof of their trailer and she makes her
ice cream there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Men looked at her. Her cousin said amusedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That should rate some sort of technical-coup feather!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Council gave her a brass pot&mdash;official,&rdquo; said Aletha.
&ldquo;Domestic science achievement.&rdquo; To Bordman she explained:
&ldquo;Her husband put a tray on the roof of their house, insulated from
the heat of the house below. During the day there&rsquo;s an insulated
cover on top of it, insulating it from the heat of the sun. At night she
takes off the top cover and pours her custard, thin, in the tray. Then
she goes to bed. She has to get up before daybreak to scrape it up, but
by then the ice cream is frozen. Even on a warm night.&rdquo; She looked
from one to another. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why. She said it was done
in a place called Babylonia on Earth, many thousands of years
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman blinked. Then he said decisively:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn! Who knows how much the ground-temperature drops here before
dawn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Aletha&rsquo;s cousin, mildly. &ldquo;The
top-sand temperature falls forty-odd degrees. Warmer underneath, of
course. But the air here is almost cool when the sun rises. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nights are cooler on all planets,&rdquo; said Bordman,
&ldquo;because every night the dark side radiates heat to empty space.
There&rsquo;d be frost everywhere every morning if the ground
didn&rsquo;t store up heat during the day. If we prevent daytime
heat-storage&mdash;cover a patch of ground before dawn and leave it covered
all day&mdash;and uncover it all night while shielding it from warm winds&mdash;&mdash;
We&rsquo;ve got refrigeration! The night sky is empty space itself! Two
hundred and eighty below zero!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>There was a murmur. Then argument. The foremen of the Xosa II
colony-preparation crew were strictly practical men, but they had the
habit of knowing why some things were practical. One does not do modern
steel construction in contempt of theory, nor handle modern mining tools
without knowing why as well as how they work. This proposal sounded like
something that was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
based on reason&mdash;that should work to some degree. But how well?
Anybody could guess that it should cool something at least twice as much
as the normal night temperature-drop. But somebody produced a slipstick
and began to juggle it expertly. He astonishedly announced his results.
Others questioned, and then verified it. Nobody paid much attention to
Bordman. But there was a hum of absorbed discussion, in which Redfeather
and Chuka were immediately included. By calculation, it astoundingly
appeared that if the air on Xosa II was really as clear as the bright
stars and deep day-sky color indicated, every second night a total drop
of one hundred and eighty degrees temperature could be secured by
radiation to interstellar space&mdash;if there were no
convection-currents, and they could be prevented by&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was the convection-current problem which broke the assembly into
groups with different solutions. But it was Dr. Chuka who boomed at all
of them to try all three solutions and have them ready before daybreak,
so the assembly left the hulk, still disputing enthusiastically. But
somebody had recalled that there were dewponds in the one arid area on
Timbuk, and somebody else remembered that irrigation on Delmos III was
accomplished that same way. And they recalled how it was done&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Voices went away in the ovenlike night outside. Bordman grimaced, and
again said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn! Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Aletha, smiling, &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t a
Doctor of Human History with a horse-raising husband and a fondness for
ice cream. Even so, a technician was needed to break down the problem
here into really simple terms.&rdquo; Then she said, &ldquo;I think Bob
Running Antelope might approve of you, Mr. Bordman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman fumed to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he? Just what does that whole comment mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Aletha, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve
solved one or two more problems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her cousin came back into the room. He said with gratification:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chuka can turn out silicone-wool insulation, he says. Plenty of
material, and he&rsquo;ll use a solar mirror to get the heat he needs.
Plenty of temperature to make silicones! How much area will we need to
pull in four thousand gallons of water a night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; demanded Bordman. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
moisture-content of the air here, anyhow?&rdquo; Then he said vexedly,
&ldquo;Tell me! Are you using heat-exchangers to help cool the air you
pump into the buildings, before you use power to refrigerate it? It
would save some power&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian project engineer said absorbedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to work on this! I&rsquo;m a steel man myself,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They settled down. Aletha turned a page.</p>

<p>The <i>Warlock</i> spun around the planet. The members of its crew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
withdrew into themselves. In even two months of routine tedious
voyaging to this planet, there had been the beginnings of irritation
with the mannerisms of other men. Now there would be years of it. At the
beginning, every man tended to become a hermit so that he could postpone
as long as possible the time when he would hate his shipmates. Monotony
was already so familiar that its continuance was a foreknown evil. The
crew of the <i>Warlock</i> already knew how intolerable they would presently
be to each other, and the foreknowledge tended to make them intolerable
now.</p>

<p>Within two days of its establishment in orbit, the <i>Warlock</i> was manned
by men already morbidly resentful of fate; with the psychology of
prisoners doomed to close confinement for an indeterminate but ghastly
period. On the third day there was a second fist fight. A bitter one.</p>

<p>Fist fights are not healthy symptoms in a spaceship which cannot hope to
make port for a matter of years.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>Most human problems are circular and fall apart when a single trivial
part of them is solved. There used to be enmity between races because
they were different, and they tended to be different because they were
enemies, so there was enmity&mdash;The big problem of interstellar flight was
that nothing could travel faster than light, and nothing could travel
faster than light because mass increased with speed, and mass increased
with speed&mdash;obviously!&mdash;because ships remained in the same time-slot,
and ships remained in the same time-slot long after a one-second shift
was possible because nobody realized that it meant traveling faster than
light. And even before there was interstellar travel, there was
practically no interplanetary commerce because it took so much fuel to
take off and land. And it took more fuel to carry the fuel to take off
and land, and more still to carry the fuel for that, until somebody used
power on the ground for heave-off instead of take-off, and again on the
ground for landing. And then interplanetary ships carried cargoes. And
on Xosa II there was an emergency because a sandstorm had buried the
almost completed landing grid under some megatons of sand, and it
couldn&rsquo;t be completed because there was only storage power because
it wasn&rsquo;t completed, because there was only storage power
because&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But it took three weeks for the problem to be seen as the ultimately
simple thing it really was. Bordman had called it a circular problem,
but he hadn&rsquo;t seen its true circularity. It was actually&mdash;like all
circular problems&mdash;inherently an unstable set of conditions. It began to
fall apart when he saw that mere refrigeration would break its solidity.</p>

<p>In one week there were ten acres of desert covered with
silicone-wool-felt in great strips. By day a reflective surface was
uppermost, and at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sundown caterwheel trucks hooked on to towlines and neatly pulled it
over on its back, to expose gridded black-body surfaces to the
starlight. And the gridding was precisely designed so that winds blowing
across it did not make eddies in the grid-squares, and the chilled air
in those pockets remained undisturbed and there was no conduction of
heat downward by eddy currents, while there was admirable radiation of
heat out to space. And this was in the manner of the night sides of all
planets, only somewhat more efficient.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>In two weeks there was a water yield of three thousand gallons per
night, and in three weeks more there were similar grids over the colony
houses and a vast roofed cooling-shed for pre-chilling of air to be used
by the refrigeration systems themselves. The fuel-store&mdash;stored
power&mdash;was thereupon stretched to three times its former calculated
usefulness. The situation was no longer a simple and neat equation of
despair.</p>

<p>Then something else happened. One of Dr. Chuka&rsquo;s assistants was
curious about a certain mineral. He used the solar furnace that had made
the silicone wool to smelt it. And Dr. Chuka saw him. And after one
blank moment he bellowed laughter and went to see Ralph Redfeather.
Whereupon Amerind steel-workers sawed apart a robot hull that was no
longer a fuel tank because its fuel was gone, and they built a
demountable solar mirror some sixty feet across&mdash;which African mechanics
deftly powered&mdash;and suddenly there was a spot of incandescence even
brighter than the sun of Xosa II, down on the planet&rsquo;s surface. It
played upon a mineral cliff, and monstrous smells developed and even the
African mining-technicians put on goggles because of the brightness, and
presently there were threads of molten metal and slag trickling&mdash;and
separating as they trickled&mdash;hesitantly down the cliff-side.</p>

<p>And Dr. Chuka beamed and slapped his sweating thighs, and Bordman went
out in a caterwheel truck, wearing a heat-suit, to watch it for all of
twenty minutes. When he got back to the Project Engineer&rsquo;s office
he gulped iced salt water and dug out the books he&rsquo;d brought down
from the ship. There was the specbook for Xosa II, and there were the
other volumes of definitions issued by the Colonial Survey. They were
definitions of the exact meanings of terms used in briefer
specifications, for items of equipment sometimes ordered by the Colony
Office.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>When Chuka came into the office, presently, he carried the first crude
pig of Xosa II iron in his gloved hand. He gloated. Bordman was then
absent, and Ralph Redfeather worked feverishly at his desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bordman?&rdquo; demanded Chuka in that resonant
bass voice of his. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to report for
degree-of-completion credit that the mining <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
properties on Xosa II are prepared as of today to deliver pig iron,
cobalt, zirconium and beryllium in commercial quantities! We require one
day&rsquo;s notice to begin delivery of metal other than iron at the
moment, because we&rsquo;re short of equipment, but we can furnish
chromium and manganese on two days&rsquo; notice&mdash;the deposits are
farther away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dumped the pig of metal on the second desk, where Aletha sat with her
perpetual loose-leafed volumes before her. The metal smoked and began to
char the desk-top. He picked it up again and tossed it from one gloved
hand to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There y&rsquo;are, Ralph!&rdquo; he boasted. &ldquo;You Indians
go after your coups! Match this coup for me! Without fuel and minus all
equipment except of our own making&mdash;I credit an assist on the mirror,
but that&rsquo;s all&mdash;we&rsquo;re set to load the first ship that comes
in for cargo! Now what are you going to do for the record? I think
we&rsquo;ve wiped your eye for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph hardly looked up. His eyes were very bright. Bordman had shown him
and he was copying feverishly the figures and formulae from a section of
the definition book of the Colonial Survey. The books started with the
specifications for antibiotic growth equipment for colonies with
problems in local bacteria. It ended with definitions of the required
strength-of-material and the designs stipulated for cages in zoos for
motile fauna, subdivided into flying, marine, and solid-ground
creatures: sub-sub-divided into carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores,
with the special specifications for enclosures to contain abyssal
creatures requiring extreme pressures, and the equipment for maintaining
a healthfully re-poisoned atmosphere for creatures from methane planets.</p>

<p>Redfeather had the third volume open at, &ldquo;Landing Grids, Lightest
Emergency, Commerce Refuges, For Use Of.&rdquo; There were some dozens
of non-colonized planets along the most-traveled spaceways on which
refuges for shipwrecked spacemen were maintained. Small forces of Patrol
personnel manned them. Space lifeboats serviced them. They had the
minimum installations which could draw on their planets&rsquo;
ionospheres for power, and they were not expected to handle anything
bigger than a twenty-ton lifeboat. But the specifications for the
equipment of such refuges were included in the reference volumes for
Bordman&rsquo;s use in the making of Colonial surveys. They were
compiled for the information of contractors who wanted to bid on
Colonial Survey installations, and for the guidance of people like
Bordman who checked up on the work. So they contained all the data for
the building of a landing grid, lightest emergency, commerce refuge for
use of, in case of need. Redfeather copied feverishly.</p>

<p>Chuka ceased his boasting, but still he grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know we&rsquo;re stuck, Ralph,&rdquo; he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
said amiably, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s nice stuff to go in the records.
Too bad we don&rsquo;t keep coup-records like you Indians!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha&rsquo;s cousin&mdash;Project Engineer&mdash;said crisply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away! Who made your solar mirror? It was more than an assist!
You get set to cast beams for us! Girders! I&rsquo;m going to get a
lifeboat aloft and away to Trent! Build a minimum size landing grid!
Build a fire under somebody so they&rsquo;ll send us a colony ship with
supplies! If there&rsquo;s no new sandstorm to bury the radiation
refrigerators Bordman brought to mind, we can keep alive with
hydroponics until a ship can arrive with something useful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chuka stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean we might actually live through this!
Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha regarded the two of them with impartial irony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Chuka,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;you accomplished the
impossible. Ralph, here, is planning to attempt the preposterous. Does
it occur to you that Mr. Bordman is nagging himself to achieve the
inconceivable? It is inconceivable, even to him, but he&rsquo;s trying
to do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he trying to do?&rdquo; demanded Chuka, wary but
amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying,&rdquo; said Aletha, &ldquo;to prove to himself
that he&rsquo;s the best man on this planet. Because he&rsquo;s
physically least capable of living here! His vanity&rsquo;s hurt.
Don&rsquo;t underestimate him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He the best man here?&rdquo; demanded Chuka blankly. &ldquo;In
his way he&rsquo;s all right. The refrigeration proves that! But he
can&rsquo;t walk out-of-doors without a heat-suit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Redfeather said dryly, without ceasing his feverish work:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Aletha. He has courage. I give him that. But he
couldn&rsquo;t walk a beam twelve hundred feet up. In his own way, yes.
He&rsquo;s capable. But the best man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; agreed Aletha, &rdquo;that he
couldn&rsquo;t sing as well as the worst of your singing crew, Dr.
Chuka, and any Amerind could outrun him. Even I could! But he&rsquo;s
got something we haven&rsquo;t got, just as we have qualities he
hasn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re secure in our competences. We know what we can
do, and that we can do it better than any&mdash;&rdquo; her eyes
twinkled&mdash;&ldquo;paleface. But he doubts himself. All the time and in
every way. And that&rsquo;s why he may be the best man on this planet!
I&rsquo;ll bet he does prove it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Redfeather said scornfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You suggested radiation refrigeration! What does it prove that he
applied it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Aletha, &ldquo;he couldn&rsquo;t face the
disaster that was here without trying to do something about it&mdash;even
when it was impossible. He couldn&rsquo;t face the deadly facts. He had
to torment himself by seeing that they wouldn&rsquo;t be deadly if only
this one or that or the other were twisted a little. His vanity was hurt
because nature had beaten men. His dignity was offended. And a man with
easily-hurt dignity won&rsquo;t ever be happy, but he can be pretty
good!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Chuka raised his ebony bulk from the chair in which he still shifted the
iron pig from gloved hand to gloved hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind,&rdquo; he said, chuckling. &ldquo;Too kind! I
don&rsquo;t want to hurt his feelings. I wouldn&rsquo;t, for the world!
But really ... I&rsquo;ve never heard a man praised for his vanity
before, or admired for being touchy about his dignity! If you&rsquo;re
right ... why ... it&rsquo;s been convenient. It might even mean hope.
But ... hm-m-m&mdash;&mdash; Would you want to marry a man like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Manitou forbid!&rdquo; said Aletha firmly. She grimaced at
the bare idea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Amerind. I&rsquo;ll want my husband
to be contented. I want to be contented along with him. Mr. Bordman will
never be either happy or content. No paleface husband for me! But I
don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s through here yet. Sending for help
won&rsquo;t satisfy him. It&rsquo;s a further hurt to his vanity.
He&rsquo;ll be miserable if he doesn&rsquo;t prove himself&mdash;to
himself&mdash;a better man than that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chuka shrugged his massive shoulders. Redfeather tracked down the last
item he needed and fairly bounced to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What tonnage of iron can you get out, Chuka?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;What can you do in the way of castings? What&rsquo;s the elastic
modulus&mdash;how much carbon in this iron? And when can you start making
castings? Big ones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go talk to my foremen,&rdquo; said Chuka
complacently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see how fast my ... ah ... mineral
spring is trickling metal down the cliff-face. If you can really launch
a lifeboat, we might get some help here in a year and a half instead of
five&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>They went out-of-doors together. There was a small sound in the next
office. Aletha was suddenly very, very still. She sat motionless for a
long half-minute. Then she turned her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owe you an apology, Mr. Bordman,&rdquo; she said ruefully.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take back the discourtesy, but&mdash;I&rsquo;m very
sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman came into the office from the next room. He was rather pale. He
said wryly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eavesdroppers never hear good of themselves, eh? Actually I was
on the way in here when I heard&mdash;references to myself it would embarrass
Chuka and your cousin to know I heard. So I stopped. Not to listen, but
to keep them from knowing I&rsquo;d heard their private opinions of me.
I&rsquo;ll be obliged if you don&rsquo;t tell them. They&rsquo;re
entitled to their opinions of me. I&rsquo;ve mine of them.&rdquo; He
added grimly, &ldquo;Apparently I think more highly of them than they do
of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha said contritely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have sounded horrible! But they ... we ... all of us
think better of you than you do of yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You in particular. &lsquo;Would you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
marry someone like me? Great Manitou, no!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For an excellent reason,&rdquo; said Aletha firmly. &ldquo;When I
get back from here&mdash;<i>if</i> I get back from here&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to marry
Bob Running Antelope. He&rsquo;s nice. I like the idea of marrying him.
I want to! But I look forward not only to happiness but to contentment.
To me that&rsquo;s important. It isn&rsquo;t to you, or to the woman you
ought to marry. And I ... well ... I simply don&rsquo;t envy either of
you a bit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Bordman with irony. He didn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;I
wish you all the contentment you look for.&rdquo; Then he snapped:
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s this business about expecting more from me? What
spectacular idea do you expect me to pull out of somebody&rsquo;s hat
now? Because I&rsquo;m frantically vain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; said Aletha calmly.
&ldquo;But I think you&rsquo;ll come up with something we couldn&rsquo;t
possibly imagine. And I didn&rsquo;t say it was because you were vain,
but because you are discontented with yourself. It&rsquo;s born in you!
And there you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean neurotic,&rdquo; snapped Bordman, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
all wrong. I&rsquo;m not neurotic! I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m annoyed.
I&rsquo;ll get hopelessly behind schedule because of this mess! But
that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aletha stood up and shrugged her shoulders ruefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I repeat my apology,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;and leave you
the office. But I also repeat that I think you&rsquo;ll turn up
something nobody else expects&mdash;and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ve no idea what it will be. But you&rsquo;ll do it now to prove
that I&rsquo;m wrong about how your mind works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went out. Bordman clamped his jaws tightly. He felt that especially
haunting discomfort which comes of suspecting that one has been told
something about himself which may be true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Idiotic!&rdquo; he fumed, all alone. &ldquo;Me neurotic? Me
wanting to prove I&rsquo;m the best man here out of vanity?&rdquo; He
made a scornful noise. He sat impatiently at the desk.
&ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; he muttered wrathfully. &ldquo;Why should I need
to prove to myself I&rsquo;m capable? What would I do if I felt such a
need, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scowling, he stared at the wall. It was irritating. It was a nagging
sort of question. What would he do if she were right? If he did need
constantly to prove to himself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He stiffened, suddenly. A look of intense surprise came upon his face.
He&rsquo;d thought of what a self-doubtful, discontented man would try
to do, here on Xosa II at this juncture.</p>

<p>The surprise was because he had also thought of how it could be done.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>The <i>Warlock</i> came to life. Her skipper gloomily answered the emergency
call from Xosa II. He listened. He clicked off the communicator and
hastened to an exterior port, deeply darkened against those times when
the blue-white sun of Xosa shone upon this side of the hull. He moved
the manual control to make it more transparent. He stared down at the
monstrous, tawny, mottled surface of the planet five thousand miles
away. He searched for the spot he bitterly knew was the colony&rsquo;s
site.</p>

<p>He saw what he&rsquo;d been told he&rsquo;d see. It was an infinitely
fine, threadlike projection from the surface of the planet. It rose at a
slight angle&mdash;it leaned toward the planet&rsquo;s west&mdash;and it expanded
and widened and formed an extraordinary sort of mushroom-shaped object
that was completely impossible. It could not be. Humans do not create
visible objects twenty miles high, which at their tops expand like
toadstools on excessively slender stalks, and which drift westward and
fray and grow thin, and are constantly renewed.</p>

<p>But it was true. The skipper of the <i>Warlock</i> gazed until he was
completely sure. It was no atomic bomb, because it continued to exist.
It faded, but was constantly replenished. There was no such thing!</p>

<p>He went through the ship, bellowing, and faced mutinous snarlings. But
when the <i>Warlock</i> was around on that side of the planet again, the
members of the crew saw the strange appearance, too. They examined it
with telescopes. They grew hysterically happy. They went frantically to
work to clear away the signs of a month and a half of mutiny and
despair.</p>

<p>It took them three days to get the ship to tidiness again, and during
all that time the peculiar tawny jet remained. On the sixth day the jet
was fainter. On the seventh it was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
larger than before. It continued larger. And telescopes at highest
magnification verified what the emergency communication had said.</p>

<p>Then the crew began to experience frantic impatience. It was worse,
waiting those last three or four days, than even all the hopeless time
before. But there was no reason to hate anybody, now. The skipper was
very much relieved.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>There was eighteen hundred feet of steel grid overhead. It made a
crisscross, ring-shaped wall more than a quarter-mile high and almost to
the top of the surrounding mountains. But the valley was not exactly a
normal one. It was a crater, now: a steeply sloping, conical pit whose
walls descended smoothly to the outer girders of the red-painted,
glistening steel structure. More girders for the completion of the grid
projected from the sand just outside its half-mile circle. And in the
landing grid there was now a smaller, elaborate, truss-braced object. It
rested on the rocky ground, and it was not painted, and it was quite
small. A hundred feet high, perhaps, and no more than three hundred
across. But it was visibly a miniature of the great, now-uncovered,
re-painted landing grid which was qualified to handle interstellar cargo
ships and all the proper space-traffic of a minerals-colony planet.</p>

<p>A caterwheel truck came lurching and rolling and rumbling down the side
of the pit. It had a sunshade and ground-reflector wings, and Bordman
rode tiredly on a hobbyhorse saddle in its back cargo section. He wore a
heat-suit.</p>

<p>The truck reached the pit&rsquo;s bottom. There was a tool shed there.
The caterwheel-truck bumped up to it and stopped. Bordman got out,
visibly cramped by the jolting, rocking,
exhausting-to-unaccustomed-muscles ride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go in the shed and cool off?&rdquo; asked Chuka
brightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said Bordman curtly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
quite comfortable, so long as you feed me that expanded air.&rdquo; It
was plain that he resented needing even a special air supply.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about? Bringing the <i>Warlock</i> in? Why the
insistence on my being here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ralph has a problem,&rdquo; said Chuka blandly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
up there. See? He needs you. There&rsquo;s a hoist. You&rsquo;ve got to
check degree-of-completion anyhow. You might take a look around while
you&rsquo;re up there. But he&rsquo;s anxious for you to see something.
There where you see the little knot of people. The platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman grimaced. When one was well started on a survey, one got used to
heights and depths and all sorts of environments. But he hadn&rsquo;t
been up on steel-work in a good many months. Not since a survey on Kalka
IV nearly a year ago. He would be dizzy at first.</p>

<p>He accompanied Chuka to the spot where a steel cable dangled from an
almost invisibly thin beam high above. There was a strictly improvised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
cage to ascend in&mdash;planks and a handrail forming an insecure
platform that might hold four people. He got into it, and Dr. Chuka got
in beside him. Chuka waved his hand. The cage started up.</p>

<p>Bordman winced as the ground dropped away below. It was ghastly to be
dangling in emptiness like this. He wanted to close his eyes. The cage
went up and up and up. It took many long minutes to reach the top.</p>

<p>There was a platform there. Newly-made. The sunlight was blindingly
bright. The landscape was an intolerable glare. Bordman adjusted his
goggles to maximum darkness and stepped gingerly from the swaying cage
to the hardly more solid-seeming area. Here he was in mid-air on a
platform barely ten feet square. It was rather more than twice the
height of a metropolitan skyscraper from the ground. There were actual
mountain-crests only half a mile away and not much higher. Bordman was
acutely uncomfortable. He would get used to it, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked fretfully. &ldquo;Chuka said you needed me
here. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Redfeather nodded very formally. Aletha was here, too, and two of
Chuka&rsquo;s foremen&mdash;one did not look happy&mdash;and four of the Amerind
steel-workers. They grinned at Bordman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to see,&rdquo; said Aletha&rsquo;s cousin,
&ldquo;before we threw on the current. It doesn&rsquo;t look like that
little grid could handle the sand it took care of. But Lewanika wants to
report.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dark man who worked under Chuka&mdash;and looked as if he belonged on solid
ground&mdash;said carefully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cast the beams for the small landing grid, Mr. Bordman. We
melted the metal out of the cliffs and ran it into molds as it flowed
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped. One of the Indians said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We made the girders into the small landing grid. It bothered us
because we built it on the sand that had buried the big grid. We
didn&rsquo;t understand why you ordered it there. But we built
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second dark man said with a trace of swagger:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We made the coils, Mr. Bordman. We made the small grid so it
would work the same as the big one when it was finished. And then we
made the big grid work, finished or not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman said impatiently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Very good. But what is this? A ceremony?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Aletha, smiling. &ldquo;Be patient, Mr.
Bordman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her cousin said conversationally:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We built the small grid on the top of the sand. And it tapped the
ionosphere for power. No lack of power then! And we&rsquo;d set it to
heave up sand instead of ships. Not to heave it out into space, but to
give it up to mile a second vertical velocity. Then we turned it
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we rode it down, that little <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
grid,&rdquo; said one of the remaining Indians, grinning. &ldquo;What a
party! Manitou!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Redfeather frowned at him and took up the narrative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hurled the sand up from its center. As you said it would, the
<ins class='corr' title="Transcriber's Note: The original showed 'sand-swept'.">sand swept</ins>
air with it. It made a whirlwind, bringing more sand from outside the
grid into its field. It was a whirlwind with fifteen megakilowatts of
power to drive it. Some of the sand went twenty miles high. Then it made
a mushroom-head and the winds up yonder blew it to the west. It came
down a long way off, Mr. Bordman. We&rsquo;ve made a new dune-area ten
miles downwind. And the little grid sank as the sand went away from
around it. We had to stop it three times, because it leaned. We had to
dig under parts of it to get it straight up again. But it went down into
the valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman turned up the power to his heat-suit motors. He felt
uncomfortably warm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In six days,&rdquo; said Ralph, almost ceremonially, &ldquo;it
had uncovered half the original grid we&rsquo;d built. Then we were able
to modify that to heave sand and to let it tap the ionosphere. We were
able to use a good many times the power the little grid could apply to
sand-lifting! In two days more the landing grid was clear. The valley
bottom was clean. We shifted some hundreds of millions of tons of sand
by landing grid, and now it is possible to land the <i>Warlock</i>, and
receive her supplies, and the solar-power furnace is already turning out
pigs for her loading. We wanted you to see what we have done. The colony
is no longer in danger, and we shall have the grid completely finished
for your inspection before the ship is ready to return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman said uncomfortably:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good. It&rsquo;s excellent. I&rsquo;ll put it
in my survey report.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Ralph, more ceremonially still, &ldquo;we have
the right to count coup for the members of our tribe and clan.
Now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was confusion. Aletha&rsquo;s cousin was saying syllables
that did not mean anything at all. The other Indians joined in at
intervals, speaking gibberish. Aletha&rsquo;s eyes were shining and she
looked incredibly pleased and satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what ... what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; demanded Bordman when they
stopped.</p>

<p>Aletha spoke proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ralph just formally adopted you into the tribe, Mr. Bordman&mdash;and
into his clan and mine! He gave you a name I&rsquo;ll have to write down
for you, but it means,
&lsquo;Man-who-believes-not-his-own-wisdom.&rsquo; And now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Redfeather&mdash;licensed interstellar engineer, graduate of the
stiffest technical university in this quarter of the galaxy, wearer of
three eagle-pinion feathers and clad in a pair of insulated sandals and
a breechcloth&mdash;whipped out a small paint-pot and a brush from somewhere
and began carefully to paint on a section of girder ready for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
next tier of steel. He painted a feather on the metal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a coup,&rdquo; he told Bordman over his shoulder.
&ldquo;Your coup. Placed where it was earned&mdash;up here. Aletha is
authorized to certify it. And the head of the clan will add an
eagle-feather to the headdress he wears in council in the Big Tepee on
Algonka, and&mdash;your clan-brothers will be proud!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he straightened up and held out his hand.</p>

<p>Chuka said benignly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being civilized men, Mr. Bordman, we Africans do not go in for
uncivilized feathers. But we ... ah ... rather approve of you, too. And
we plan a corroboree at the colony after the <i>Warlock</i> is down, when
there will be some excellently practiced singing. There is ... ah ... a
song, a sort of choral calypso, about this ... ah ... adventure you have
brought to so satisfying a conclusion. It is quite a good calypso.
It&rsquo;s likely to be popular on a good many planets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bordman swallowed. He was acutely uncomfortable. He felt that he ought
to say something, and he did not know what.</p>

<p>But just then there was a deep-toned humming in the air. It was a
vibrant tone, instinct with limitless power. It was the
eighteen-hundred-foot landing grid, giving off that profoundly bass and
vibrant, note it uttered while operating. Bordman looked up.</p>

<p>The <i>Warlock</i> was coming down.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
