<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>The bitter and protracted discussions which have arisen
out of the Dreyfus case, and which have divided France
into two hostile camps, have concentrated the attention of
the civilised world on the French army, but nobody has
done more to disgrace it, and to lower it in the eyes of
friends and foes alike, than Frenchmen themselves.</p>

<p>Those who, persuaded of Dreyfus' innocence, made
superhuman efforts to further the noble cause of justice
and to obtain the redress of one of the greatest wrongs
ever committed against a human being, spoiled their noble
task by indiscriminate and wholesale abuse of the army
in general, holding the thousands of French officers responsible
for the conduct of a few of their number. Those,
on the other hand, who believed in the guilt of Dreyfus,
based their conviction upon their blind belief in the infallibility
of half a dozen officers who had passed judgment
upon the condemned man. Trusting to unworthy subordinates,
the highest officers of the General Staff made of
Dreyfus' guilt a matter on which they staked their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
honour and reputation, and when they discovered that
they had been deceived, they found themselves in the
position of having either to acknowledge that they had
been befooled, or else of having to stand by those who
had led them into their awkward predicament. They
chose the latter alternative, and their friends and supporters
played into the hands of those who so fiercely
attacked the army, by refusing to admit that there could
be a single black sheep in it, and by thus linking together
the whole body of French officers and making their
collective honour dependent on the honour of every individual
member.</p>

<p>A time came, however, when even the most determined
partisans of this system had to turn against those they
had extolled but the day before. First came Esterhazy,
the liar, the swindler, and the traitor; then Henry the
forger, and de Paty du Clam, his accomplice.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that amidst all these scenes of
violent abuse there should be but one man who maintained
implicit trust in the good faith of his worst enemies&mdash;Dreyfus
himself&mdash;the victim of this most abominable conspiracy.</p>

<p>His case is, unfortunately, but a greatly magnified
example of what daily happens throughout the French
army, and the recollections I am now offering to the reader,
of the time I served in its ranks, will show that Dreyfus
has been a victim not so much of the malice of individuals
as of a faulty system. It will be seen how, in a regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
the Colonel forms his opinion of a private from the
character given to him by his Corporal or Sergeant, and
how the mere fact of appealing against a punishment is
considered as an act of insubordination. It is always the
same principle&mdash;<i>le respect de la chose jugée</i> (the upholding
of a judgment, without considering upon what grounds or
evidence it has been delivered).</p>

<p>I wish it to be clearly understood that this little book
has not been written for the purpose of attacking the
French army as represented by its officers. It is intended
merely as a faithful account of the hardships I endured
when I served my time in the ranks&mdash;hardships which
every Frenchman has still to bear. I cannot follow
M. Urbain Gohier in his virulent and indiscriminate
attacks upon all French officers&mdash;among whom individuals
differ as in other classes of men; but each one of my
readers will be able to draw his own conclusions with
regard to the system which, in practice, is universally in
force.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Every Frenchman is liable to military service during
twenty-five years of his life&mdash;viz., from the age of twenty
until he is forty-five.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In time of peace this period of service is thus divided:</p>

<p>(i) Three years of active service.</p>

<p>(ii) Ten years in the reserve of the standing army,
during which two periods of a month each with the colours
must be undergone.</p>

<p>(iii) Six years in the territorial army, with two periods
of thirteen days each with the colours, and</p>

<p>(iv) Six years in the reserve of the territorial army.</p>

<p>The conscription lists are thus made out:</p>

<p>Every year the Mayor of each "Commune" draws up a
list of all the young men who have arrived at the age of
twenty during the past twelve months.</p>

<p>These lists must be posted up by January 14 at the
latest. The names of the sons of foreigners, if born in
France, are included, and unless they claim foreign
nationality they are liable to serve, and on failing to do so
when called upon are regarded as deserters and punished
accordingly.</p>

<p>Domicile is established by the parents' residence.</p>

<p>Every year the War Minister fixes the number of conscripts
required to serve three years with the colours; those
in excess of that number are called upon to serve for one
year only; but during the following two years they are liable
to be called upon to complete their time of active service.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>In order to determine those who are to benefit by this
arrangement <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tirage au sort</i> (drawing lots) is resorted to.</p>

<p>In time of peace, conscripts falling under any of the
following categories, among others, are also called upon to
serve for one year only:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The eldest of orphans, or the eldest son of a widow,
or of a family whose father is blind, or has reached his
seventieth year.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The only son in a family of seven children or more&mdash;or
the eldest son of a family of at least seven.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The elder of twins.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Brothers of men engaged in active service.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Brothers of a man who has been killed, or who has
died in active service, or who has been invalided on
account of disease contracted, or wounds received, while
serving.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Young men who have signed an engagement to serve
during ten years as teachers in the National schools.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Students in law, science, or medicine who have
already obtained their admission to the Government
Universities or other institutions mentioned in the Act.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) Students of the religious institutions who are studying
to become ministers of one of the religions recognised
by the State.</p>

<p>Provided that, in classes (<i>f</i>), (<i>g</i>), (<i>h</i>), such young men
have obtained their final degree before their twenty-sixth
year, or that religious students have been ordained before
the end of their twenty-sixth year, failing which, they are
called upon to complete three years' active service.</p>

<p>Whoever has been convicted of theft, obtaining money
by false pretences, rape, and other crimes against
morals, and has been sentenced to more than three
months' imprisonment for such crimes, or has been sentenced
twice for similar offences, is sent to special
battalions in Algeria. If, at the time a conscript is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
upon to serve, he is undergoing imprisonment, he begins
his service at the expiration of his sentence.</p>

<p>Instead of joining their regiment like other conscripts,
these men have to report themselves on a certain date at
the headquarters of the military district to which they
belong, and they are thence taken by gendarmes to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépôt</span> of their battalion. They are subjected to an iron
discipline, being commanded by officers and non-commissioned
officers picked out from other regiments where
they have distinguished themselves for their harshness.
Many are the tales of dreadful revenge taken by these conscripts
on their officers. It is no uncommon thing for a few
of them to play away the life of an officer at cards, the loser
being obliged to kill him within a certain time. To quote
but a single instance: A few years ago one of these
battalions was being marched from Biskra to Tuggurt in
Southern Algeria. Before leaving, four of the men had
played away the life of their Major at cards. The loser,
who was to carry out the deed, pretended to be ill, and
kept to the rear of the column. On the second day he
kept still farther back, and sat down pretending to be
exhausted. The Major, who had fallen far behind, seeing
the man, spoke to him kindly, telling him to make an
effort. "Oh, sir," said the soldier, "I can't; I am done
for." The Major kindly handed the man his flask to take
a pull from, and as he was replacing it in his holster, the
man fired his rifle point blank at his officer. Fortunately
the horse swerved, and the bullet missed. Thereupon
the Major drew his revolver, and blew the ruffian's brains
out. A few months later a stone was found on the spot
bearing this inscription:</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Here<br />
On the 10th of December 18&mdash;<br />
Private &mdash;&mdash;<br />
Was murdered by Major X.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The man who placed the stone there was never discovered,
and, although it was removed by order of the
military authorities, another one bearing a similar inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
soon afterwards stood in its place. Six times these
stones were removed, and six times they were replaced,
yet the guilty parties were never detected. It is hardly
to be wondered at if the officers of these battalions usually
carry loaded revolvers.</p>

<p>To return to our description of the mode of recruiting.</p>

<p>The lists having been duly posted up, a day is appointed
for drawing the lots. This public ceremony is presided
over by the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sous-préfet</span>" of the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arrondissement</span>."
Having counted the number of names on the list, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sous-préfet</span>
places a corresponding number of tickets, each
bearing a number, in an urn: he then calls out the names
of the young men, and each in turn draws a ticket; in
case of absence of one of them his lot is drawn by the
Mayor. As already explained only a certain number of
men being required to serve three years, those who draw
the highest numbers stand a chance of serving for but
twelve months, besides those who have a right to claim the
privilege, although the latter are also bound to draw lots.</p>

<p>All the young men whose names appear in the lists have
next to appear before a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de Revision</i> (Revising Commission).</p>

<p>This Commission consists of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Prefect of the Department, who is ex-officio President.<br />
A <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseiller de Préfecture</span>.<br />
A Member of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil Général</span>.<br />
A Member of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil d'arrondissement</span>.<br />
A General or Field Officer appointed by the military authority.<br />
An Intendant militaire (Commissariat officer).<br />
The chief Recruiting Officer of the district.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A military Surgeon, or a Doctor, is appointed by the
military authorities to make a medical examination of all
the conscripts, and upon his report the Commission
decides by vote whether each individual conscript shall
serve or not. It should be added that the minimum height
is 5 feet 0&frac12; inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The Commission also decides upon claims of exemption
made by sons of foreigners, and upon the claims of those
entitled to a service of one year only.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Each conscript subsequently receives his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feuille de route</i>,
stating the regiment he must join, and the date on which
he must join it, and making an allowance for his journey to
the town where he is to be quartered.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> From the moment
conscripts receive their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feuilles de route</i> they are under
military law, and can only be tried by court-martial for any
crimes or offences they may commit.</p>

<p>Men while serving for a month in the reserve, or for a
fortnight in the territorial army, are also exclusively under
martial law for the time being. Even in the case of a
soldier who has finished his service the fact of his assaulting
one of his former superiors (from a Corporal upwards)
renders him liable to be tried by court-martial "should
such assault be considered the result of revenge for a
punishment received during his service."&mdash;(Art. 223 and
224 of the Code of Military Justice.) So that a man who
has been abominably treated during his time of service
and who gives a good hiding to one of his former officers
ten or twenty years later, is liable to be tried by the
military authorities.</p>

<p>I may add here that the act of striking a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">supérieur</i>,
meaning any man superior in rank to one's self, from a
Corporal upwards, is punished with <span class="smcap">DEATH</span>, <i>even in time of
peace</i>. Two instances occurred while I served. In the
first instance a private had struck a Corporal who had
bullied him in a most shameful way; in the second instance
a Corporal had struck an officer who had called his mother
by a vile name. Both men were found guilty and publicly
shot in the presence of their regiment on special parade.
It very seldom occurs that a man who has struck even a
Corporal is reprieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In each subdivision of every military district is kept a
register in which are inscribed the names of all the men
in that subdivision who are serving, or have served.</p>

<p>In this register is stated the date at which each man
has been incorporated, as well as the date of his leaving
the service, the date of his passing into the reserve, then
into the territorial army and into the reserve of the territorial
army, until he has satisfied all his military obligations.
Every change of address is also noted.</p>

<p>Every soldier receives on joining his regiment a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">livret
matricule</i>, a book in which are stated his age, his name,
the address of his parents, his full description, the list of
all the punishments he has received, and many other particulars.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance for every Frenchman to
keep this book carefully, as it has to be produced whenever
required by the military, civil, or judicial authorities, and
its loss entails several days' imprisonment. Whenever a
Frenchman&mdash;until he has reached the age of forty-five
and has thus satisfied all his military obligations&mdash;wishes
to absent himself from his domicile, he is bound to present
his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">livret</i> at the nearest <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarmerie</i> and to declare where
he is going: this is written down in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">livret</i>, and on
arrival at his new residence he must have this book "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">visé</i>"
anew. If he goes abroad he must present it to the French
Consul, and whenever he changes his residence for more
than three months, he must repeat the operation exactly
after the fashion of a ticket-of-leave man in England. To
omit to do so renders the offender liable to imprisonment.
It is therefore easy to realise the tremendous power of the
military authorities in France.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The military law I have just explained is that which has
been in force since 1889 only. It differs from the previous
law chiefly in regard to the length of service. In my time
(1879) the period of service in the active army was five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
years instead of three. Young men, however, who had
obtained the degrees of B.A. or B.S., provided they paid
£60 to Government, and provided also they contracted a
voluntary engagement within the year preceding that in
which they became liable to conscription, were allowed to
serve only one year instead of five. During the next four
years they still belonged, however, to the active army, and
were liable to be called at any time by decree of the War
Minister. These young men were officially called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Engagés
conditionnels</i>, but commonly termed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires d'un an</i>, or
by abbreviation <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>. It was as such that I served.</p>

<p>I have roughed it a good deal since those days, but I
have no hesitation in saying that the time of my active
service with the colours was the bitterest experience I
ever underwent.</p>

<p>In the case of a nation which possesses no public schools
like the great institutions of England, I believe that compulsory
military service might be made an excellent moral
and physical training for young men in every rank of life.
But the French system is vicious. A system in which
gentlemen of refinement and the vilest dregs of the city
slums are subjected to identical treatment, and ruled by
identical measures of discipline, is an impossible one.
Take punishments, for instance. "Equality of punishment"
may sound well in theory, but in practice it becomes
the rankest inequality. A gentleman accustomed to comfort,
or perhaps luxury, is for the slightest fault sent to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> to endure the degrading horrors presently
to be described&mdash;his companions are perhaps roughs who
have never slept in a bed since they were children, to
whom dirt is a mere necessary condition, and vermin are
"familiar beasts."</p>

<p>Where is the equality of punishment in such a case?</p>

<p>It must not be thought either that some compensation
lies in the comparative infrequency of the punishments
meted out to gentlemen. The contrary is the truth. For
an equal fault the rough usually gets a shorter punishment
than the man of higher class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The German system is very different. In Germany
they also have the reduced service of one year for young
men who have fulfilled certain conditions of superior education.
But these <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ein jahr preiviller</i>, as they are called, form
a class absolutely distinct from the other privates, and are
distinguished by a uniform of better cloth. During the
first month of their service they live in barracks, where
they learn the routine of a common soldier's duties, but
afterwards they are allowed lodgings in the town where
their regiment is quartered, and they are altogether treated
differently from the rest.</p>

<p>Then, again, in the German army non-commissioned
officers cannot punish a private, the Captain alone having
the right of punishment, while in the French army a
Corporal could give us two days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>; a Sergeant,
four; a Sergeant-major, a Sub-lieutenant, or a Lieutenant,
eight; and a Captain could send us to prison. Each of
those punishments was usually increased by the Major,
and also by the Colonel, and it will scarcely be credited
that <i>no man could appeal against a punishment until he
had undergone the whole of it</i>. Things have altered a
little since General Boulanger was Minister of War, but
very slightly. There is still no higher appeal than to the
Colonel, and such a thing as a private or even an officer
having the right to ask for a court-martial in case he
considers himself unjustly punished does not exist. But
more of this in the sequel.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>In order to enable readers to understand clearly the
account of my adventures, I think it will be necessary to
describe somewhat fully the routine of a French cavalry
regiment, as well as the rights and duties of officers, non-commissioned
officers, and privates.</p>

<p>Any one desiring further particulars can obtain them
from a little book called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Règlement du Service Intérieur
des troupes de Cavalerie." (Paris: Librairie Militaire de L.
Baudoin, 30 rue Dauphine.)</span></p>

<p>The following are the titles of the officers and non-commissioned
officers of a French cavalry regiment, with
the duties and responsibilities which theoretically devolve
upon them. How far those duties are carried out will
appear in the course of my narrative.</p>


<div class="center">COLONEL.<br />
(<i>Five Gold Stripes.</i>)
</div>

<p>The authority of the Colonel extends over every part of
the service. He is responsible for the discipline, military
education, instruction, police, hygiene, and appearance of
the regiment he commands. He directs its administration
with the help of a ""<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil d'administration</span>." He
appoints all non-commissioned officers and Corporals.</p>


<div class="center">LIEUTENANT-COLONEL.<br />
(<i>Three Gold and Two Silver Stripes.</i>)
</div>

<p>"The Lieutenant-colonel is the intermediary of the
Colonel in every branch of the service. He acts on
behalf of the Colonel in the absence of the latter....
When thus acting he states that the orders are the
Colonel's, so that the authority of the latter should be
sustained....</p>

<p>"Among the books he has to keep are those containing
the individual notes on each officer, in which are entered
twice yearly the punishments inflicted on each officer,
and information as to their military as well as private
conduct, their instruction, and military aptitude. These
notes are countersigned by the Colonel, who adds whatever
remarks he thinks fit...."</p>


<div class="center">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">CHEFS D'ESCADRONS</span> (<span class="smcap">Majors</span>).<br />
(<i>Four Gold Stripes.</i>)
</div>

<p>There are two of these in each regiment, each commanding
two squadrons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"The '"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chefs d'Escadrons</span>' see that the Captains commanding
their squadrons carry out their duties, as well as
the Colonel's orders, with zeal and intelligence....</p>

<p>"One of them presides over the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commission des ordinaires</i>
(food supply). The other presides over the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commission
d'abatage</i> (killing of horses)...."</p>

<p>Each of them has also to look carefully into the service
of the kitchens of their squadrons, and they must frequently
visit the canteens.</p>

<p>They take in turns the weekly duty and are in charge
of the general police of barracks. Under their orders
they have for this service a Captain and an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>.</p>


<div class="center">MAJOR.<br />
(<i>Two Gold and Two Silver Stripes.</i>)
</div>

<p>The duties of this officer are chiefly connected with the
general administration of the regiment&mdash;accounts, purchases,
pay, equipment, barrack furniture, &amp;c. He is in
command of the 5th squadron,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
which forms the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépôt</span> in case of war.</p>


<div class="center">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">CAPITAINE INSTRUCTEUR</span>.</div>

<p>The Capitaine Instructeur is chiefly concerned with the
instruction of the non-commissioned officers. He also
gives the Lieutenants and Sub-lieutenants lectures on
shooting, artillery, topography, hippology, &amp;c., and has to
teach the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudants</i> (to be described later) their duties.</p>


<div class="center">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">CAPITAINE TRÉSORIER</span> (<span class="smcap">Paymaster</span>).</div>

<p>He receives all moneys for the use of the regiment; he
makes all payments authorised by the Council of Administration,
of which he is a member.</p>

<p>He keeps the "archives" of the regiment. Every five
days he hands over the pay to the Captain commanding
each squadron or to his Sergeant-major, and issues the
demand for forage supplied through the ""<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Intendant</span>" (an
official apart from the regiment).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>Under him he has a Deputy, a Lieutenant, or Sub-lieutenant.</p>


<div class="center">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">CAPITAINE D'HABILLEMENT</span>.</div>

<p>This Captain is in charge of the armoury, clothing, and
barrack furniture, keeping all accounts relating to the same.</p>

<p>All the regimental workshops are under his orders: the
chief armourer, the master saddler, the master tailor, and
master bootmaker.</p>

<p>Under this officer is:</p>

<div class="center">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">THE PORTE ÉTENDARD</span>.</div>

<p>A Lieutenant who helps generally his immediate chief,
and carries the colours on parade.</p>


<div class="center">DOCTORS.</div>

<p>Two Doctors are attached to each cavalry regiment&mdash;a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">médecin major</i> (captain-surgeon) and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">médecin aide major</i>
(lieutenant-surgeon). Their duties are similar to those of
regimental doctors in an English regiment.</p>


<div class="center">VETERINARY SURGEONS.</div>

<p>Two Veterinary Surgeons are attached to each regiment,
and their duties need not be described here.</p>


<div class="center">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">CAPITAINES</span> (<span class="smcap">Captains</span>).<br />
(<i>Three Stripes.</i>)
</div>

<p>There are two Captains in each squadron&mdash;the Captain
Commanding (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">capitaine commandant</i>) and a second Captain
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">capitaine en second</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Commanding.</span>&mdash;This officer is in full charge of
the squadron (in time of peace a squadron consists of about
120 men and horses); he is the real chief and almost the
only one the non-commissioned officers and men of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
squadron know, many of them leaving the service without
having ever been spoken to by such an exalted and god-like
being as a Major, much less by their Lieutenant-colonel or
Colonel. The Captain in command is himself a very great
man indeed, who has very little intercourse with such
riff-raff as common privates. No leave nor promotion can
be obtained except through him, and punishments are
usually increased when they reach His Mightiness. When
I served my time I think I saw my Captain nearly twenty
times in as many months, but nevertheless I must show
what his duties are&mdash;in theory. Let us quote once more
from the ""<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Service Intérieur</span>."</p>

<p>"The chief duty of the Captain Commanding is to
inspire the soldiers under his command with zeal and
love [!] of the service; to develop among them feelings
of duty, honour, and devotion to their Fatherland. He
must endeavour to make their duties easy by advice, the
equitable use of his authority, and a constant solicitude
for their welfare. He is the necessary intermediary of all
their requests.... He must repress the familiarity and
harshness of his subordinates towards the privates, who
must never be illtreated or insulted."</p>

<p>He has also to look after the officers under his direct
orders. "He visits his squadron daily, visits the men in
hospital, and signs a daily report to the Colonel."</p>

<p>"He is responsible for the military education of his
squadron, for the discipline of the rank and file, the
condition of the horses and stables...."</p>

<p>He is also responsible for the moneys and supplies
handed over to him.</p>

<p>The Captain receives from the Treasurer the money for
the use of the squadron on the 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st,
and 26th of each month. This money is divided into two
parts: the first being the money to be spent on the men's
food, and the second being the men's pocket-money,
"which," say the regulations, "must not be less than
5 centimes (&frac12;<i>d.</i>) per day." The money invariably handed
over to the men is 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> every five days in the infantry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
4<i>d.</i> every five days in the cavalry! Corporals get about
twice as much, while Sergeants get about 4<i>d.</i> a day, and
Sergeant-majors 8<i>d.</i> What would Tommy Atkins say to
that?</p>

<p>All the accounts and books are kept by the Sergeant-major,
the Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i>, and the Corporal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i>,
non-commissioned officers whose duties will be described
more fully later on. All clothes, saddlery, arms, &amp;c., are
supplied to the men in the presence of the Captain: all
repairs are done on his written requisition.</p>

<p>When the men's food is supplied through the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commission
des ordinaires</i> the Captain finds every day the amount
of supplies required. When, however, he receives money
for the purchase of provisions he must see that supplies
are bought at the cheapest rate.</p>

<p>The daily rations for each private are as follows:</p>

<p>Ten ounces of meat (bone included).</p>

<p>One pound of bread for soup, which is reduced to 3&frac12;
ounces if stew is served instead of soup.</p>

<p>In the same way the ration of meat is reduced if fish,
lard, or preserves are given to the men.</p>

<p>The Captain in Command assigns a horse to each trooper,
and has to see that the horses are kept in good condition.
He reports on all matters to his Major.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Captain.</span>&mdash;The duties of this officer are two-fold:
first, in the squadron, and secondly, as Captain on
regimental duty for the week&mdash;"Captain of the Week."</p>

<p>In the squadron he is under the orders of the Captain
Commanding, but he is specially in charge of all matters
connected with the food supply.</p>

<p>In case of the absence of the Captain Commanding he
takes the command of the squadron. The five Second Captains
take "the week" by turn. The "Captain of the Week"
is under the immediate orders of the "Major of the Week."
He has to see to the roll-calls, the assemblies, and the
changing of guards. He is in charge of the cells, and is
responsible for the cleanliness of the barracks, and their
police and security. The evening roll-call takes place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the rooms, and is made by each Sergeant-major, who hands
over his report to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>, who makes out a general
bulletin and hands it over to the "Captain of the Week."
This Captain may order extra roll-calls in the middle of
the night should he think fit to do so.</p>


<div class="center">LIEUTENANTS AND SUB-LIEUTENANTS.</div>

<p>There are four of these in each squadron, and they take
in turn the "weekly service" (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">service de semaine</i>). As such
they must be, or ought to be, present at "stables," drill,
&amp;c. Let us quote again from the ""<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Service Intérieur</span>": "They
must maintain perfect order in their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i> [company]
excite emulation among their men, advise union" [the only
union I ever saw was in the hatred all the men felt against
them], "develop the love of service, and always show an
impartial example of justice." [But wait until I tell my
own story.] "The chief of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i> visits it daily. He
inquires into everything relating to it....</p>

<p>"He sees to the cleanliness of his men" [mine must
have had peculiar ideas on the subject].... "Often and
without warning he inspects the clothes of a man whom
he suspects of bad conduct.</p>

<p>"He passes constant reviews of the men's effects"
[doesn't he], "and when a man returns after an absence of
fifteen days or more he inspects his kit...."</p>

<p>He does many other things&mdash;in theory&mdash;but chiefly acts
on the principle that rules are made to be broken.</p>


<div class="center">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">PETIT ETAT MAJOR</span> AND "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">PELOTON HORS RANG</span>.</div>

<p>Under these titles are known all the skilled assistants
(whether non-commissioned officers or troopers) who are
employed as clerks in the offices of the Treasurer, and
other officers employed in the various administrative services
of the regiment. The "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capitaine d'habillement</span> acts
as their Captain Commandant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<div class="center">ADJUDANTS.</div>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudants</i>, although non-commissioned officers,
wear the uniform of a Sub-lieutenant, the only difference
being that their galloons are striped with a small red thread.
They receive from the troopers and other non-commissioned
officers the same marks of respect as officers.</p>

<p>There are three <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudants</i> in each cavalry regiment.
The first two are the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudants</i> proper, while the third
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant vaguemestre</i>) has different duties. The two
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudants</i> have under their immediate authority all the
Sergeants and Corporals so far as the discipline and the
general police of barracks are concerned. They have to
keep watch over the private conduct and appearance of
the Sergeants.</p>

<p>They take "the week" in turn under the immediate
orders of the "Captain of the Week." All strangers wishing
to enter the barracks are referred to him when he takes
"the week." The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> receives from the one he has
relieved:</p>

<p>(1) The list of all Sergeants and Corporals, so as to
arrange their rotation of duty;</p>

<p>(2) The list of the various Sergeants and Corporals who
take "the week" at the same time as himself;</p>

<p>(3) The register of punishments of non-commissioned
officers and troopers, on which he inscribes all punishments
of two days or more of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, or confinement to the
room, or of four days or more C.B.;</p>

<p>(4) The list of men under punishment, which he hands
over to the Sergeant of the Guard.</p>

<p>He posts up in the orderly room the list of the officers,
Sergeants, and Corporals "of the week."</p>

<p>He is responsible for all trumpet calls.</p>

<p>The Colonel's orders and decisions are handed over to
him for dictation to the various Sergeant-majors, by whom
they are read aloud to the troopers of each squadron, after
afternoon "stables."</p>

<p>He conveys the General's orders to the Colonel. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
morning after <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réveille</i> each Sergeant-major hands over to
him a report on the morning roll-call, but this call never
actually takes place in the cavalry.</p>

<p>At the same time the Sergeant of the Guard hands over
to him the register bearing the names of all troopers who
have returned to barracks after the last roll-call (9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>),<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and he reports on these to the "Captain of the Week."</p>

<p>He sees that the canteens are closed at the proper time,
and that lights are extinguished in the rooms at 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
He has besides the general control of all men undergoing
punishment.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen what enormous power the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>
has. With his connivance a trooper may absent himself
for three or four days without any one being the wiser.
Let a Sergeant or a Sergeant-major dare to report the
matter to the Captain and he will soon discover what it
will cost him. How I made use of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> will be
seen when I describe my personal adventures. "Stand
well with your Sergeant-major and one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudants</i>
and you are all right," is a well-known saying in the
French cavalry.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant-vaguemestre</i> is really the regimental postmaster
and postman; he collects letters, cashes money-orders
for the troopers, and does all sorts of dirty work
others don't care to undertake; he acts as Sergeant-major
to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Peloton hors rang</i>, and is usually chosen from among
old Sergeants who are unfit for anything else.</p>

<p>Of the skilled artisans, armourers, saddlers, tailors, &amp;c.,
little or nothing need be said, as they are soldiers but in
name.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the true inner life of a regiment,
the squadron and its units.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>SERGEANT-MAJOR (<span class="smcap">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maréchal des Logis Chef</span></span>).</p>

<p>The Sergeant-major is the right hand of the Captain
commanding a squadron. In theory he is, of course, far
below a Lieutenant or Sub-lieutenant; in practice&mdash;at
least in most squadrons&mdash;he is the real head of the
squadron in barracks. He is in hourly contact with the
Sergeants, Corporals, and troopers, and it is through the
Sergeant-major that the Captain judges them. Most
Sergeant-majors will send a man to prison in the Captain's
name, knowing well that the latter will approve of and
endorse their decision.</p>

<p>"The Sergeant-major," says the ""<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Service Intérieur</span>,"
"must study the conduct, the character, and the capabilities
of the Sergeants, Corporals, and troopers of his squadron,
in order to give information to the officers, and chiefly to
the Captain commanding the squadron. He gives all
orders with regard to duty, dress, and discipline....
He is the Captain's agent in all matters of administration
and accounts, he is responsible for the proper keeping
of all books, registers, &amp;c., and for the proper state of all
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</i> belonging to the squadron.</p>

<p>"The Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i> and Corporal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i> do the
clerical work under his immediate supervision. He is
responsible for the proper keeping of the squadron stores
and must supervise the reception, distribution or return
of every article, whatever may be its nature...." The
Sergeant of the Week hands over to him the list of all
sick men and reports to him on every roll-call.</p>

<p>"It is through him that all applications of the Sergeants,
Corporals, or troopers must be addressed; after informing
the Lieutenant he submits these applications to the Captain.
Troopers cannot, without his leave, change their rotation
of duty."</p>


<div class="center">SERGEANT (<span class="smcap">Maréchal des Logis</span>).</div>

<p>"The Sergeants give the Corporals and troopers all
orders relating to duty, police, discipline, and military
instruction." They take in turn the duty "of the week"
in their squadron. Sergeants drill the men of their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>,
and are responsible to their Lieutenant for the horses of
their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>They have to take particular care that the rooms are
kept in proper order, that the men have their clothes
properly cleaned and arranged above their beds, and
no article of their kit is missing; they take care
that the arms and saddlery are always kept in perfect
order; they are responsible for the cleanliness of their
men, seeing that their clothes are duly mended, and that
they are frequently shaved and have their hair cropped
short.</p>

<p>Whenever the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i> is ordered to assemble, the
Sergeant passes through the rooms to see that the
troopers are getting ready. If the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i> has to be
mounted, the Sergeant sees that the horses are properly
saddled. He always superintends "stables" and sees
that the horses are properly groomed. When the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>
is ordered to assemble singly, he calls the roll and reports
to the Lieutenant in command; in case, however, the
whole squadron is ordered out, he reports to the Sergeant-major.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sergeant of the Week.</span>"&mdash;The Sergeant of the
Week is under the direct orders of the officer "of the

<p>He reports on the morning and evening roll-calls to the
Sergeant-major, and hands over to him the list of the sick
troopers. At the daily parade of the squadron he notes
all duties which are ordered and designates the troopers
for the fatigues and distributions. After <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réveille</i> he goes
to the stables and superintends their cleaning and airing;
he must see that all head-stalls and stable utensils are in
proper order; he transmits to the stable guards their
orders, and sees that these are punctually executed. In
case of the sickness of a horse he sends at once for the
Vet.</p>

<p>The Sergeant of the Week also keeps the key of the
oat-bin and is responsible for the proper distribution of
its contents as well as of forage. Before the time fixed
for the assembly of the guard of the day he sees that the
troopers who have been ordered for such duty are properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
turned out. He then escorts them to the place which has
been fixed for the parade. He takes to the cells the
troopers who are to be punished, and those who are sick
to the Doctor's inspection.</p>

<p>He has to see that all corridors, staircases, and rooms
of his squadron are kept clean, and swept twice daily.</p>


<div class="center">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">SERGENT-FOURRIER</span></div>

<p>The Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i> is under the direct orders of the
Sergeant-major, keeping all books and accounts under his
supervision; he receives besides, on his behalf, all
supplies, and is responsible for them. He escorts every
man sent to hospital.</p>


<div class="center">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">CAPORAL-FOURRIER</span>.</div>

<p>This N.C.O. helps generally the Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i>. He
enters in a book all the orders issued by the Colonel, and
takes it to each officer of the squadron; he reads these
orders out to the assembled troopers after afternoon
"stables."</p>


<div class="center">CORPORALS.<br />
(In command of an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">escouade</i> of about ten men.)
</div>

<p>"A Corporal sleeps in the same room with the troopers
of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">escouade</i>; he sees that his troopers wash their heads,
faces, hands and feet." He sees that the beds are properly
made, and that the troopers ordered for special duty are
in readiness. Once a week, on the day fixed by the
Captain, he gets all the kits thoroughly cleaned.</p>

<p>"He takes particular care that the troopers change
their linen once a week."</p>

<p>On pay-day he receives the pay from the Sergeant-major
and hands it over to the troopers. He superintends
the drill of the recruits, teaches them how to do their
packing, and how to clean their arms and kit. He also
shows them how to groom their horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>He reports to the Sergeant the punishments he has
given, and reports to him on matters generally.</p>

<p>At <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réveille</i> he compels the troopers to rise, and calls the
roll; he sees that all beds are uncovered, and that the
great-coats which may have been used at night are
properly rolled up. He then sends to the stables a
certain number of men to feed the horses and to clean the
stalls.</p>

<p>"When the other men are dressed he orders the windows
to be opened in order to change the air."</p>

<p>He takes the names of the sick men, and reports on the
events of the night.</p>

<p>He designates a trooper in turn to clean and tidy up
the room. (When several <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">escouades</i> sleep in the same
room the senior Corporal is in charge.) It is his duty to
keep proper order. He stops all games likely to lead to
quarrels, he sends men who are drunk to bed; should
they disturb the peace he calls the Sergeant of the
Week by whom they are sent to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>. He
forbids smoking in bed, and sees that troopers take their
meals properly. In winter he takes care that the stoves
are heated in moderation, and in the evening sees that the
water jug is full. When the trumpeter has sounded
"lights out," he sees that all lights are extinguished.</p>

<p>When an officer enters the room the Corporal commands
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fixe!</i>" (attention). The troopers rise, uncover
themselves, and stand at attention until the officer has
given the word "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Repos!</i>" (stand at ease). Should the
officer be a Field or General officer the Corporal commands
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A vos rangs&mdash;Fixe!</i>" at which command every
trooper stands at the foot of his bed at "attention."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> "<span class="smcap">Corporal of the Week</span>" helps generally the
"Sergeant of the Week," who, in practice, relies upon him
for the performance of many of the duties he is supposed
to carry out himself.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<div class="center">PUNISHMENTS.</div>

<p>"The following are regarded as offences against discipline,
and punished as such according to their gravity:</p>

<p>"On the part of the superior, every act of weakness,
abuse of authority, insulting language, or the unjust infliction
of any punishment.</p>

<p>"On the part of the inferior, murmuring, unseemly
answers, lack of obedience (whatever may be the circumstances
or the provocation); evading a punishment;
drunkenness (even without disturbance); general misconduct,
debt, quarrels ... in fact, every dereliction of
military duty, whether it is the result of negligence, laziness,
or stubbornness."</p>

<p>The fact of publishing, even under a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</i>, a
book, pamphlet, article, or letter, whatever may be its
subject, without previous leave from the Minister of War,
is considered an offence against discipline.</p>

<p>"<i>Any man belonging to the army or navy can be
punished by another man holding a rank superior to his
own, whatever may be the place or the circumstances.</i>" To
be rightly understood this requires some explanation.
For instance, a Captain in the navy (who ranks as a
Colonel), on leave in Paris, meets at a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café</i> a Major of a
cavalry regiment; if the latter does not salute him, or misbehaves
himself in any way, the naval officer can punish
him on the spot. It constantly happens, for instance, that
a trooper of a cavalry regiment passing a Corporal of the
line fails to salute him. The Corporal has the right to
punish the trooper forthwith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"The officer in command of a regiment can increase or
reduce punishments; he can even cancel them. In that
case, he points out to the officer or non-commissioned
officer the mistake he has made, and orders him to cancel
himself the punishment he has inflicted...." The
Captain in command of a squadron can increase a punishment
inflicted by one of his direct subordinates. He
cannot, however, reduce such punishment without the
Colonel's leave.</p>


<div class="center">PUNISHMENT OF OFFICERS.</div>

<p>The following are the punishments which may be inflicted
on regimental officers:</p>

<p>(a) "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arrêts simples</span> (confinement to rooms).</p>

<p>(b) Reprimand by Colonel.</p>

<p>(c) "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arrêts de rigueur</span> (strict confinement to room).</p>

<p>(d) "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arrêts de forteresse</span> (confinement in a fortress).</p>

<p>(e) Reprimand by a General.</p>

<p>A Lieutenant can inflict a punishment of four days
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrêts simples</i> on a Sub-lieutenant; a Captain a punishment
of eight days on any officer of lower rank; a Captain
of a squadron fifteen days on officers of his own squadron;
a Major fifteen days, and the Colonel thirty days, on any
officer of a rank lower than their own.</p>

<p>An officer thus placed under arrest must attend to his
military duties as usual, but in the intervals he must keep
to his room, and may receive no visits except official ones.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arrêts de rigueur</i> (viz., confinement to the room, with a
sentry posted at the door) and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrêts de forteresse</i> can be
inflicted by the Colonel alone. He can give any officer
under his orders thirty days of the former and fifteen days
of the latter.</p>

<p>(In no case can an officer apply for a court-martial, as
in England. In some regiments, especially in the line,
officers get punished more frequently than privates get
mere C.B. in a British regiment.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"The punishment begins from the moment it has been
inflicted."</p>

<p>Let it be also noted that an officer can inflict a punishment
on any other officer inferior in rank to himself, to
whatever squadron he may belong, and can similarly
punish officers of other regiments; and, as stated before,
any officer in the navy can punish an officer in the army
of inferior rank, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vice versâ</i>!</p>

<p>Recent events in France give special interest to this
subject, and I will therefore give some account of various
other punishments which can be inflicted upon French
officers without enabling them to appeal to a court-martial.</p>

<p>The question is, indeed, one of such high interest at the
present juncture that I will quote verbatim from the Army
Regulations:</p>

<p>"When an officer commits a fault, which&mdash;without being
such as to entail the loss of his commission or his being
sent before a court-martial&mdash;is still serious enough to
require a heavier punishment than those above described,
he can be suspended (placed in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non-activité</i>) or his commission
can be cancelled (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ils peuvent être mis en réforme</i>)."</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non-activité</i>, which means the temporary exclusion
from the service, is determined by decree of the President
of the Republic upon the report of the Minister of War.</p>

<p>The "superior authority" decides as to the causes which
may necessitate the placing of an officer in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non-activité</i>, a
disciplinary measure taken in cases of less serious a nature
than those for which an officer may lose his commission
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peut-être mis en réforme&mdash;c'est-à-dire, l'exclusion définitive
de l'armée</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>).</p>

<p>The place of an officer who has been suspended (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non-activité
par suspension d'emploi</i>) is not filled up during a
year, and he can be sent back to his regiment before the
expiration of that period.</p>

<p>An officer placed in non-activity <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par retrait d'emploi</i>
remains in that position for an unlimited period, but at
the end of three years a court of inquiry (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un conseil
d'enquête</i>) is called upon to give its opinion as to whether
the officer ought to be cashiered or not (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si l'officier doit
être mis en réforme</i>).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>When the officer commanding a regiment considers
that an officer under his orders cannot remain <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en activité</i>
either on account of misconduct or on account of neglect
of duty, or else through incapacity, he details his complaint
against the said officer in a report he sends to
the Major-general commanding his brigade. He specifies
whether he considers that the officer ought to be suspended
for a time or permanently (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si l'officier doit être
mis en non-activité par suspension ou par retrait d'emploi</i>),
and sends with his complaint a list of the various punishments
inflicted on the officer, a copy of the officer's notes,
and, if necessary, documents relating to the facts upon
which the demand is based.</p>

<p>The documents are examined by the General commanding
the brigade, who forwards them to the General
commanding the division, who sends them in his turn to
the General commanding the army corps, by whom they
are forwarded to the Minister of War. Each one of the
above-mentioned Generals writes his opinion on the case.</p>

<p>An officer who has been suspended (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mis en non-activité</i>)
remains subject to military discipline under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">surveillance</i>
of the General commanding the military district where
he has been allowed to reside.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mise en réforme</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
(cashiering) is determined by the President of the
Republic upon the proposal of the Minister of War as a
disciplinary measure.</p>

<p>This punishment can be inflicted upon an officer as
an immediate measure without it being necessary that
he should have been previously suspended: it can
be inflicted for habitual misconduct, serious neglect of
duty, or breach of discipline, or dishonourable conduct.
It can also become the consequence of three years of non-activity
either as a disciplinary measure or through ill-health.
When an officer is, as above stated, sent before
a commission of inquiry (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil d'Enquête</i>) the minutes
of the proceedings are forwarded to the Minister of War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The opinion of such a commission cannot be modified
except in favour of the officer<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
(<i>sic</i>). An officer who
has been cashiered (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en réforme</i>) is liberated from all
obligations imposed on officers in a position of activity or
non-activity.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>I have wandered far away from the regiment, I have
quoted dry law, and I feel afraid that readers will begin
to ask, "But what about your own adventures?" I am
as anxious as my readers to get to them, but I think it
better to get rid of all the dreary details first, and this
introduction will enable me to go on with my story
without having constantly to stop to explain this or that.
I shall not abuse the patience of my readers much longer,
but there are still a few details I must explain, and I
hope that I shall be forgiven for doing so.</p>

<p>The punishments which may be inflicted on non-commissioned
officers are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i) Confinement to barracks after the evening roll-call.
This is given to Sergeants who show laziness in, or
ignorance of, their work, or who return late to barracks.
(N.C.O.s, unless thus punished, can remain out till 11
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span>)</p>

<p>(ii) Confinement to barracks. Inflicted on a Sergeant
whose personal appearance is slovenly, or who allows
his men to fail in their appearance.</p>

<p>(iii) Confinement to the room. Inflicted for slight
breaches of discipline. For more serious offences N.C.O.s
are sent to prison. (Except, in the latter case, N.C.O.s
under punishment have to do their duty as usual.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>(iv) Reprimand by Captain commanding the squadron.</p>

<p>(v) Reduction in rank (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">retrogradation</i>).</p>

<p>(vi) Absolute loss of rank (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cassation</i>).</p>

<p>Corporals in the French army do not rank as N.C.O.s.
The latter are far better treated now than they were in my
time, the change being entirely due to General Boulanger,
and being one of the causes of his great popularity among
the soldiers. Until he became Minister of War, non-commissioned
officers could be sent to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>
(lock-up). An <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> could give a Sergeant eight days
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, or fifteen days' C.B., and a Sergeant-major
could give the Sergeants four days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>
and eight days' C.B. Sergeants could even be sent to
prison by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudants</i>. There existed a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>
separate from the one allotted to the men, to which Sergeants
and Corporals were sent together, the only difference
being that Sergeants were allowed a straw mattress and
blanket, while the Corporals were only allowed one blanket
and slept on boards.</p>

<p>The punishments inflicted on Corporals are:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>(a) Confinement to barracks.</p>

<p>(b) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> (lock-up).</p>

<p>(Until General Boulanger became Minister of War
Corporals could give a trooper two days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>;
a Sergeant could inflict four days, a Sergeant-major eight
days, and an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> fifteen days, or four days' prison.)</p>

<p>Troopers confined to barracks are employed in doing
the hardest and dirtiest manual work. They take part in
every drill and duty besides. Those sent to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle
de Police</i> are kept at night in the lock-up. Troopers sent
to prison do no duty, but undergo special punishment
drill for three hours in the morning and three hours at
night. They are deprived of pay, of sugar, and of coffee.</p>

<p>Troopers in the cells are kept in confinement day and
night. Only a blanket without bedding is allowed to the
troopers in prison or in the cells.</p>

<p>Any Corporal or trooper who, during his three years'
service, has been sent to prison or to the cells, must at the
expiration of his three years' service, remain with the
colours for a number of days equal to those he has spent
in prison or in the cells.</p>

<p>I have not yet exhausted the list of punishments which
may be inflicted upon French privates. There is another
one more terrible than all the others I have described.
This consists in sending a soldier to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Compagnies de
discipline</i>. This means transportation to Algeria. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the soldier is drafted into one of the special companies
encamped far away in the interior. The men are drilled
for several hours daily, and during the remainder of the
time they are employed at road-making and subjected to
other hard labour. Officers and Sergeants in command
are always armed with loaded revolvers, and at the least
sign of disobedience they can blow a man's brains out.
For the slightest fault these men are sent to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">silos</i>&mdash;deep
holes dug in the ground, and funnel-shaped at the
bottom, so that neither standing, sitting, nor lying down is
possible. They are left there for one or two days with
bread and water. An awful case occurred some years
ago in connection with these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">silos</i>, which will be described
in the course of my narrative.</p>

<p>"The Minister of War," say the regulations, "has full
power to send to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Compagnies de discipline</i> any private
who has committed one or several faults, the gravity of
which makes any other mode of repression inadequate."</p>

<p>Usually, however, such men are tried before a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil
de discipline</i>. When the Captain in command of a
squadron considers that one of his troopers has deserved
to be sent to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Compagnie de discipline</i> he sends a written
report to the Major stating the faults or misdemeanours of
the trooper and the punishments which have been inflicted
upon him, dwelling upon the recurrence of certain acts
which show a perseverance in ill-doing, a danger to the
good order of the service.</p>

<p>This report is endorsed by the Major, and the Lieutenant-colonel,
who hands it over to the Colonel. The latter can
either transmit this report to the Minister of War, who
decides upon the case, or (as is usually done) he can
assemble a disciplinary commission (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de discipline</i>)
consisting of the following officers of the regiment:</p>

<p>One Major (who presides over the commission).</p>

<p>The two senior Captains and the two senior Lieutenants,
provided they do not belong to the squadron of the trooper
to be tried.</p>

<p>The Captain who applies for the infliction of the punishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as well as the Major who commands the squadrons
to which the trooper belongs, lay their case before the
court. They then retire, and the trooper is brought in
and makes his defence. The court then deliberates and
sends its decision to the Colonel. It must be remembered
that the court merely gives its advice, and this is
sent to the General commanding the division of which the
regiment is a unit. Should the court recommend the
trooper to be sent to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Compagnies de discipline</i>, the
General can decline to act upon their advice, but should
the court decide that the trooper ought not to be sent
there, the General is bound to abide by the decision.
This seems, at first blush, an equitable procedure, but
when we remember the almost unlimited power possessed
by a Colonel over the officers of his regiment, it is easy to
realise that a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de discipline</i> usually sits for the mere
purpose of carrying out the well-ascertained wishes of the
supreme regimental authority.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>


<p>I have already explained that twenty years ago, when
I served my time in the ranks of the French army,
French military law differed from what it is now. It is
true that&mdash;speaking generally&mdash;every able-bodied Frenchman
was then, as now, compelled to undergo five years'
active service, but for young men who had graduated at a
University there was the loop-hole of escape described in
the Introduction. Having no ambition to serve for five
years as a private, I naturally determined to avail myself
of the benefit of the law, and accordingly in the month of
August 1879 I went over to the headquarters of the
military division of Paris, and there, after producing all
the papers required by French red-tapeism,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> I signed a
voluntary engagement for a period of one year (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Engagement
conditionnel</i>).</p>

<p>A month later I received orders to appear before the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de revision</i>, held in the town-hall of my district.
About two hundred fellows, belonging to every class of
society, were waiting in the yard&mdash;most of them, indeed,
being roughs from la Villette (the Whitechapel of Paris).
We were called up by batches of twenty-five, and shown
by gendarmes into a room, around which stood long
benches with pegs above them. A red-hot stove was
burning in a corner of this room, and as there was no
ventilation of any kind, and more than one hundred
unwashed ruffians had already undressed and dressed
there, the smell was abominable. A gendarme then
ordered us to strip off all our clothing, barring our socks,
and when we had done so&mdash;what a sight we were!&mdash;he
called each one of us in turn and placed us under a
measuring gauge. He first took our height with our
socks on, and then without them&mdash;except in the case of
those who possessed no such garment, and who formed
the majority. The gendarme who measured us was a
Sergeant, and he dictated to a private the result of his
measurements. When my turn came he placed me under
the apparatus and then asked for my name.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>"Decle," I said.</p>

<p>"And your Christian name?"</p>

<p>"Lionel."</p>

<p>"Lionel," he replied: "that's not a Christian name."</p>

<p>I assured him that it was my Christian name, and, what
was more, the only one I possessed.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a queer Christian name, and I don't know
where your people fished it out," he remarked. After a
glance at the scale he dictated "1·78 metre in his socks,"
to his subordinate. He then ordered me to remove my
socks, and, measuring me once more, pronounced the
verdict "1·79 metre without socks."</p>

<p>"But, Sergeant," I asked, "how can I be taller without
my socks than with them on?"</p>

<p>"You will perhaps teach me my business!" he angrily
replied, and seeing that the private was hesitating to write
down the figures, "D&mdash;&mdash; you," he shouted, "are you
going to take that down or not?"</p>

<p>The private silently obeyed, doubtless accustomed for
years to passive obedience.</p>

<p>I was then told to stand aside, and another fellow was
called up. We were then sent, each in turn, into another
room, where sat the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de revision</i>, presided over by
a General in full uniform, assisted by officials also in
uniform, and a few respectable-looking old gentlemen.
I confess that I felt rather shy at having to appear without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
clothes before so ornamental a company, whose uniforms
strangely contrasted with the state of nature I was in. A
clerk, having inquired my name, fished out my papers
from a huge bundle, and asked me a long list of questions
about my family history. The President then inquired
whether I could show any cause why I should not serve,
and upon my negative reply, a military surgeon proceeded to
examine me. A paper was handed over to him by the clerk.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he said. "You're one metre seventy-eight
in your socks, and a centimetre more without them?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I said to the gendarme, sir," I replied,
"but he told me to shut up."</p>

<p>The gendarme was called and questioned about the
matter.</p>

<p>"All I can say, sir," he replied, "is that a machine
can't lie, and I've had enough experience not to make a
mistake."</p>

<p>There was a burst of laughter from all the members of
the council, which seemed to greatly astonish the old
gendarme. The doctor took me back to measure me himself,
and finding that my exact height was one metre
seventy-nine without socks, he pointed this out to the
gendarme. The latter, however, shook his head. "Well,
sir," he stoutly declared, "all I can say is that he was
one seventy-eight just now." I was brought back to the
council-room and the doctor then proceeded to take my
chest and other measurements, dictating to the clerk a
list of my various "points." He then asked me about
my past illnesses, and inquired into the health of my
father, mother, and grand-parents. He then tested my
heart and lungs, felt my legs, and examined my teeth; concluding
the whole performance by making me sit down,
walk, and cough. I felt like a horse under examination by
a "Vet." The result of this inspection was that I was
passed as fit for service. Before retiring I was asked
whether I preferred to serve in the infantry, artillery,
heavy or light cavalry. I expressed a desire to serve in
the Dragoons, and my wish was duly noted. Shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
afterwards I received notice to present myself at one of the
Paris cavalry barracks, in order to pass an examination
in riding, for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, having then to serve only one
year, were admitted into the cavalry only if they could
already ride. The examination was a most simple one:
we had to mount a horse, which was saddled, but without
stirrups, and then had to walk, trot, and canter once round
the riding-school. About a score of others passed the
examination at the same time as myself, and only one
candidate, who managed to fall off his horse while trotting,
was rejected as unfit to serve in the cavalry, though of
the whole batch hardly three could pretend to a knowledge
of horsemanship.</p>

<p>At the beginning of October I received a notification
that I was to serve in the 9th Dragoons, at Dinan in
Brittany. I was most anxious not to go so far from Paris,
and as my maternal uncle then held a most prominent
position in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Senat</i>, being Leader of the Left Centre, I
obtained a letter from him to the Minister of War, who
allowed me to choose whatever regiment I liked. One year
before, a great friend of mine, Baron de Lanoy, had
enlisted for five years in the 50th Dragoons stationed at
Noilly,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and he had lately been promoted to the rank of
Sergeant. He had strongly advised me to join his regiment,
the Colonel of which, the Marquis de Vieilleville,
was most favourably disposed towards the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>.
At my request I was accordingly drafted into that regiment.
Unfortunately, shortly before I joined, the Marquis died,
and was replaced by Colonel Hermann, who hated <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>,
and proved, as will be seen, a martinet of the worst
type.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>Towards the end of October I received my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feuille de route</i>,
ordering me to present myself at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> at the cavalry
barracks at Noilly. It was a dull, dreary, miserable, wet
day when I took a train at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gare du Nord</i> at half-past
seven in the morning, to begin my military experiences&mdash;experiences
which proved, as will be seen, little short of
what I might have had to suffer had I been sentenced to
hard labour. An hour later the train stopped at Noilly,
where, following the advice previously given to me by my
friend de Lanoy, I drove to the Crown Hotel, the best in
the place, engaged a room, and hastily swallowed the last
decent breakfast I was to enjoy for many days to come.
Half an hour before the appointed time I drove to the
barracks. The sentry stood shivering in his box, and the
thought then flashed across my mind that it would soon
become my lot to stand there myself. I passed the gate,
and seeing one of the troopers standing outside the guardroom,
I was about to ask him where I could find my friend,
Sergeant de Lanoy, when a Sergeant, dragging his sword
on the ground, stepped out of the guard-room and addressed
me:</p>

<p>"Hullo! what do you want, you there?"</p>

<p>"Sir," I replied, "I am a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>, and I want to go
and see a friend of mine, Sergeant de Lanoy."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>, are you? Well, you can
wait where you are!"</p>

<p>"But, sir," I asked again, "can't I be allowed to go and
see Sergeant de Lanoy?"</p>

<p>"What! Answers, eh? You'll have to be put through
your paces at once, my fine fellow, or else you will make
the acquaintance of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boite</i> (cells) sooner than you care
for. Wait there and shut up," he concluded.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it, therefore, but to walk up and
down in the drizzling rain. I had already visited the
barracks once, a few months before, when I came to pay
a call on de Lanoy, little thinking then that I should soon
belong to his regiment. Now they presented a much
keener interest for me, and I looked anxiously at my
surroundings. On each side of the gate stood a small
lodge. One of these was used as a guard-room, the other
was the residence of the barrack caretaker, a post usually
bestowed on an old pensioned non-commissioned officer.
The barrack yard itself was about 400 yards long and
250 broad; in the middle of it stood the riding-school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
flanked on each side by two rows of huge two-storied
buildings running at right angles to the entrance gate.
On the ground floor of these buildings were the stables,
and above them the men's quarters. The right-hand
portion of the barracks was occupied by an infantry
regiment, while the remainder was used by the Dragoons.
It may here be noted that different names are given
to the barracks occupied by cavalry and by infantry,
the latter being called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casernes</i>, while the former are
termed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quartiers</i>. The yard was teeming with life:
troopers in stable uniforms were running to and fro, some
carrying buckets of water, others empty-handed; in front
of me was a group of half a dozen men pumping water
into a long tank running along the riding-school; other
troopers were sweeping the yard while one of their
number collected in a wheelbarrow the little heaps of
refuse gathered by the others; then an officer came
out of the riding-school and called to a trooper to take
back his charger to the stables. In a few moments a
man came running to the guard-room, and shouted to
the Trumpeter to call the Sergeants of the Week quickly,
as the Captain of the Week wanted them. The Trumpeter
sounded the call, and had hardly finished when five
Sergeants came at a run and went to the Captain, who
stood near the riding-school, where I could hear him
abusing them with frantic gesticulations. My attention
was next called to six troopers in stable dress (but with
swords and carbines), their faces turned towards a wall;
they were being drilled by a Sergeant, and I was struck
by the length of time during which they remained in the
same position. While I was looking at them the Sergeant
gave a word of command, and the troopers stood with
their swords extended at arm's length: two, three, minutes
elapsed, and I could see the poor fellows getting so tired
that they had to bend their bodies to remain with their
swords in the right position; the Sergeant, walking up
and down, did not seem to mind this, but one of the
troopers, having slightly bent his arm, the Sergeant, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
monotonous tone of voice, calling the fellow by name,
said, "So-and-so, two days more for not holding your
sword straight." This seemed to me little short of barbaric
cruelty. I afterwards realised that this exercise was
punishment drill for men punished with prison. Soon the
Trumpeter sounded "Soup," and every trooper employed
in the barrack square hurried to put away his tools, while
men rushed from every corner, shouting like school-boys
let loose. While I was watching the scene I have
described I noticed the arrival of a tall, handsome, and
well-groomed young man in civilian attire, who asked me
if I was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>, adding that he was himself one, and
that he wanted to know where he had to report himself.
In order to save him from the Sergeant's abuse, I warned
him that he had better wait with me until the Sergeant of
the Guard called us. While we were talking the Sergeant
appeared on the threshhold of the guard-room, and, at the
top of his voice, shouted out, "What the deuce are you
hatching there, you idiots? I suppose you're another of
these (using a double-barrelled adjective) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>?"
turning to my companion.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the young fellow.</p>

<p>"Well, why the devil don't you come and report yourself,
you blockhead?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," replied Walter&mdash;for such we will suppose his
name to be&mdash;"this gentleman," pointing to me, "told
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This gentleman told you!" howled the Sergeant, "this
<i>gentleman</i>, indeed; you're really too damned polite. You're
another colt who requires breaking in. Now, you two
young <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pekins</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> advance to orders, and show me your
papers." We produced our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feuilles de route</i>, and the Sergeant
having examined them told us to go to the Paymaster's
office in the town. "Oh! you want to speak to Sergeant
de Lanoy, do you?" he said to me. "I'll give you a trooper
to take you to him."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>Having asked my new comrade to wait a few minutes
for me outside the barracks, so that we might go together
to the Paymaster's office, I was going with the trooper
towards de Lanoy's quarters when we met him coming to
look out for me. I told him how I had been treated by
the Sergeant of the Guard, and he replied that he was not
in the least astonished, as the fellow was a brute, adding
that he had no right to keep me waiting when I asked to
go and see him. "I'll have it out with him," he remarked,
adding: "You go straight to the Paymaster's office and
ask to be drafted into my squadron, the 3rd, and I'll see
that you're placed under my orders, so that I can look
after you." We then parted, and outside the barracks, I
found Jack Walter waiting for me. Curiously enough,
though he was the first acquaintance I made in the regiment,
our friendship, which began that day, has lasted
ever since. My friend is of English origin (his grandfather
having been an Englishman who became naturalised in
France), and were I to mention his real name it would be
recognised by most of my readers as that of a rising
painter of undoubted genius, whose works have graced
many a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salon</i>. We went to the Paymaster's office, and,
although we were rather upset by the reception we had
received from the Sergeant of the Guard, we were both
very keen on serving.</p>

<p>The Paymaster made no difficulty about placing me in
the 3rd squadron, while Walter was drafted into the 2nd,
having a letter of introduction to one of the officers of that
squadron. We each received a paper from the Paymaster's
clerk with instructions to hand them over to our respective
Sergeant-majors; the clerk kindly added that we need not
return to barracks before 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, as the Sergeants were
eating their breakfast. When I returned to the barracks
I went to the Sergeant of the Guard and told him that I
was back from the Paymaster's office, asking him to direct
me to my Sergeant-major's office.</p>

<p>"Do you take me for a sign-post?" he answered.</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied, "but I wanted your leave before
asking a trooper to show me the way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"You long-nosed chap, you're a soldier now, remember
that; so do me the honour of calling me 'Sergeant,' and
not 'sir.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant," I replied. He then ordered a trooper
who stood in the guard-room to take me to the office of
my Sergeant-major. "By the way," he said, as I was
going off, "what squadron do you belong to?"</p>

<p>"To the 3rd squadron, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"It's a pity you don't belong to mine," he answered:
"I should like to have had you under my orders; it would
have been a real pleasure to lick you into shape. But
God help you if you ever cross my path. I don't like your
face. When I don't like a man's face it's a poor chance
he stands with me. Now go, clear out of this."</p>

<p>I'm sorry to say that it was my misfortune to have this
man later on as my chief, and he duly proved that his
boast was no vain one. When I reached the Sergeant-major's
office I met outside the door my friend de Lanoy,
and informed him that I had managed to be placed in his
squadron.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it," he said: "I will go with you to see the
Sergeant-major, and try to get you put in my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>"
(company).</p>

<p>The Sergeant-major's office was a small room about sixteen
feet by twelve, and served as a bedroom as well as an
office. Three non-commissioned officers slept in it; the
Sergeant-major, the Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i>, and the Corporal
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i>, who ranks as a non-commissioned officer.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> At a
huge table in the centre of the room sat the Sergeant-major,
a cold, stern, and distant individual. He granted
de Lanoy's request, and put me in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>, ordering him
at the same time to assign me a bed. De Lanoy, now my
Sergeant, took me to the room where the 120 men of our
squadron lived, ate, and slept. Two lateral partitions, ten
or twelve feet high, ran the whole length of the room,
with beds on each side of them. There were thus four
rows of beds running along the room, each row being
occupied by the troopers belonging to the same company.
The beds themselves seemed so narrow that one could
hardly realise how a man could manage to sleep in one of
them. At the head of each bed hung the trooper's sword;
on a nail near it was suspended the bag containing brushes
and other stable implements, while laid on two shelves running
along the whole length of the room, above the beds,
each trooper had his clothes carefully folded, and covered
with a canvas bag on which the number under which he
was registered appeared in large figures. On the top of
this stood the helmet, with a pair of boots on each side
of it. In each corner of the room the carbines stood on
racks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>"Although you are not allowed to have any one to help
you," said de Lanoy to me, "it is simply impossible for
you to make your bed and to clean yourself, your clothes,
your boots, saddlery, and weapons, for, the moment you
begin the special work allotted to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, you will only
have two hours to spare for meals every day; you must
therefore arrange with two men to do your work, and I
will place you between two good fellows whom I can trust
to look after you. Only mind you," he added, "the new
Colonel hates <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, and as any man found helping
them will be severely punished, you will have to allow
ten francs a week to each of the troopers who look after
your things." He then gave me an empty bed which was
placed between those of the two men he had selected and
who were only too glad to look after me. One of them
was a Parisian ruffian, nicknamed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Titi de la Villette</i>, and
the other a country bumpkin whom every one called "the
old un," on account of his prematurely aged appearance.
By de Lanoy's advice I gave Titi five francs to buy a
two-gallon jar of wine for the troopers belonging to my
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>.</p>

<p>I then returned to the Sergeant-major's room, in order
to supply him with particulars about myself such as have to
be registered in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">livret</i> (regimental book) handed over
to every French soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's your name?" he began.</p>

<p>"Decle."</p>

<p>"What's your Christian name?"</p>

<p>"Lionel."</p>

<p>"Your profession?"</p>

<p>"I have none."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," he replied, "a good-for-nothing, like all the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>." He then asked me for my father's name,
Christian name and profession. I had also to give him
my mother's maiden name, and to tell him whether I had
any brothers or sisters. After this followed some rather
ludicrous questions:</p>

<p>"Can you read and write?"</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I suppose so, considering that I am
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>, and have therefore taken a University
degree."</p>

<p>"I want none of your remarks," replied the Sergeant-major,
staring at me from head to foot; "answer my
questions. Can you swim?" I replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"How many times have you been convicted?" I protested
against the implication most energetically, but this
only brought down on me a few cutting remarks about my
cheek and impertinence. I had then to state whether I
had had small-pox, whether I had been vaccinated or not,
and whether I meant to re-enlist at the end of my year's
service. My reply was in the negative as may well be
imagined.</p>

<p>The Sergeant-major having taken down all my answers
looked at me once more from top to toe, and then
delivered the following little speech: "Look here, my
boy," he began, "don't you run away with the idea that
military service is all beer and skittles, or you'll soon be
disappointed. I know what you <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> are like; you
come here and imagine that you are going to have a good
time of it; but I warn you that you will have a devilish
bad time of it if you don't keep straight. I'm a good sort
of fellow enough, but all the troopers will tell you that I
am pretty stiff. I won't punish you often, but when I do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
you'll remember it. You're too much of a fine gentleman
for my taste, so I fancy it won't be long before you get
into trouble. Now you can clear out&mdash;Sergeant de Lanoy
will tell you what you have to do."</p>

<p>I retired, a sadder but a wiser man.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>


<p>When I returned to my room the Corporal told me to
follow him, as I had to undergo another medical inspection.
Two other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> who had been drafted into my
squadron accompanied us; one of them evidently belonged
to the middle classes, but the other looked a mere farm
hand; he was, indeed, the son of a small farmer who had
made great sacrifices to give his son a good education, and
the boy, brought up in a Government school, had managed
to get his B.A. degree, and his people had with difficulty
scraped together the £60 necessary for obtaining the
privilege of serving for one year only. The fact of the
poor boy having been foolish enough to elect to serve in
the cavalry can only be ascribed to his ignorance, as he
lacked sufficient means for this branch of the service, and
a bad time of it he had, poor fellow.</p>

<p>"I say," the Corporal said to me confidentially, "that
chap is a nice sort of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>: fancy&mdash;he said that he'd
be blowed if he was going to pay eight bob a week to get
a trooper to fag for him, and he's only given two bob for
us to drink his health with, and not a brass farthing to me,
his Corporal. Ain't I going to set him to work he won't
relish!"</p>

<p>I took the hint and promptly handed the Corporal a ten-franc
piece.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean that as a hint, of course," he said,
pocketing the money, "but I know you're quite the gentleman,
and the right sort too, and besides, you're a friend of
Sergeant de Lanoy, a real live Count, and the best of
fellows into the bargain. I say you, what's-your-name,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the Corporal went on, addressing the country bumpkin,
"that's the canteen, what are you going to stand us?"</p>

<p>"Oh," replied the poor fellow blushing, "I thought we
were going to the medical inspection?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course we are," replied the Corporal, "but I
can see that the Surgeon-major hasn't turned up yet, so
we've got lots of time."</p>

<p>Taking pity on the poor fellow, I invited the Corporal
and my two comrades to accompany me to the canteen,
where we each had a cup of coffee, or rather chicory, with
a glass of brandy, a refreshment which cost six pence for
the four of us. The third <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> insisted upon standing
another drink, and then we hastened to the dispensary.
There we were told to wait in a large, bare ante-room,
and Walter, whom I had not seen since the morning, joined
us. "A queer lot," he said, looking at our companions
(there were fourteen of us, all told). One of them especially
attracted our attraction, for he had a huge moustache and
was apparently a man of thirty. Half a dozen at most
looked gentlemen, while the others were, to say the least,
commonplace. Few of us felt inclined to be communicative,
and when the Surgeon-major turned up he found
us gazing at each other in silence. The Surgeon-major
was a short, active, sharp-spoken man, and having entered
his office he sent the Corporal in charge of the dispensary
to order us to strip. Once more we were measured, felt,
and thoroughly examined, all of us with one exception
being passed as sound in wind and limb. The only one
who failed to pass was rejected for short-sight, and ultimately
invalided by the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réforme</i>" commission. Our
respective Corporals then took us back to our rooms, mine
choosing a route through the canteen, where he insisted
upon treating us&mdash;with the money I had given him&mdash;and
he was half-seas-over before we left.</p>

<p>On our return to the room we found the Sergeant
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i> awaiting us, and he at once took us to the store,
where we were to receive our outfit. The store consisted
of a long apartment, along the centre of which rows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
shelves ran, reaching from floor to ceiling; on these were
classified, according to size, every conceivable article of
regimental outfit, each department being under the charge
of a skilled regimental Sergeant&mdash;a Sergeant tailor, a
Sergeant bootmaker, a saddler, and a Sergeant storekeeper.
We were first sent to the tailor. When my
turn came he cast a glance over me, took from a shelf two
pairs of trousers, two tunics, and one morning jacket. A
Corporal showed us how to put them on according to
regulations. The trousers are made of red felt, the seat
and inside of the legs being of double thickness, that is to
say, fully one inch thick; from the knee downwards they
were covered with soft but thick leather, with straps to fix
under the boots. When I first held them in front of me
they nearly reached to my chin, but the Corporal said that
they would be all right. I therefore got into them, but
when I pulled my braces as tight as they would go, the
trousers reached my armpits, and were so broad and so
stiff that I could only walk with legs apart, to say nothing
of their weight, which amounted to a good many pounds.
I next got into my tunic, but the sleeves were so long that
they reached the middle of my hand, while the collar was
several inches too large for me. Under the collar of the
tunic we had to fasten twice round our necks a blue cotton
tie, two inches broad, fastened in a single knot in front.
The tunic, a blue one, had a white collar with the regimental
number in red figures embroidered on a blue background.
A white strap was also affixed to the outside of
the cuffs of the sleeves. The Corporal having examined
me, ordered me to go to the bootmaker's department, in
another part of the stores. "When you have been fitted
with boots," he said, as I was walking off, "you must
return to the tailor, who will send you to be inspected by
the Captain."</p>

<p>When I reached the bootmaker's special corner, I found
him cursing furiously because he could not fit one of my
comrades. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Ah ces nom de Dieu de &mdash;&mdash; d'volontaires
faudrait leur y faire des bottes expres. Ah malheur de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Dieu vrai!"</span> At last he seemed to have succeeded and
called me forward in turn. Having told me to take off one
of my boots he looked at it: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Encore un d'ces malheurs de
Dieu qu'a des pieds qu'ça fait suer,"</span> he exclaimed. "I
shall never find boots for you," he went on, "why have
you got a long narrow foot like that? Damnation!
damnation!" he kept repeating as he went to look through
his stock.</p>

<p>I must mention here that only four sizes of boots are
kept in stock; they all are square-toed and immensely
broad; the heels are nearly two inches high, with spurs
nailed on to them. The top of the boot is made of a soft
piece of leather on which two leather tags are sewn, the
boot itself reaching half way up the calf of the leg. Most
French soldiers are, I suppose, flat-footed. At any rate
every boot presented to me was so low in the instep that
I could not find a single pair in which I could insert my
feet, until, at last, the assistant bootmaker triumphantly
produced a pair about two inches too long and an inch too
broad for me, explaining that if I put sufficient straw inside
them they would fit all right. Finally, I had to pull down
the leather portion of my trousers over the boots, not
forgetting to fasten the under straps which alone prevented
the boots from dropping off my feet. I hobbled as well as
I could towards the tailor; he turned me round admiringly.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he said, "go and show yourself to the
Captain."</p>

<p>My boots, as I have just said, were only held on my
feet by the straps under them, and at every step my spurs
caught in the heavy leather coverings of my trousers, but
at last I managed to reach the Captain.</p>

<p>He ordered me to unbutton my tunic, and looking at my
elephantine trousers: "What's that?" he cried; "put your
braces lower," and artistically creasing my trousers from
top to bottom, he stepped back a few feet, and having had
a good look at me: "They're too short," he said, "go and
get another pair from the tailor." As I was hobbling away
he called me back. "What are those boots you've got on?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
They are too big for you. Are you such an idiot that you
can't feel they are too big?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But!" he exclaimed, "now look here, my boy, please
understand that we don't allow remarks of any kind in the
army. Go and get another pair of boots and trousers, and
look sharp about it."</p>

<p>I stumbled back towards the bootmaker. "The Captain
says," I began, "that these boots are too large for me and
that you must find me another pair."</p>

<p>"Ah, these d&mdash;&mdash;d <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, what a lot of trouble they
give us!" sighed the bootmaker. After looking through all
his stock he chucked three more pairs at me. In vain I
tried to get into them, and called the bootmaker to show
him that none of them would fit me. "Why the deuce
don't you take off your socks, socks aren't regulation," he
angrily retorted. Notwithstanding my protests, I had to
take them off. At last I managed to get one foot inside a
boot, but the other, notwithstanding the efforts of two
strong men, resisted. "All right," said the bootmaker,
"I'll stretch it a bit later on."</p>

<p>So with only one boot on I hobbled to the tailor. "The
Captain says my trousers are too short," I told him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll soon put them to rights," he answered.
Having pulled my braces lower down he thereupon proceeded
to crease the leather at the bottom of the trousers.
"Now go back to the Captain," he said.</p>

<p>When I once more appeared before that officer he looked
at me in utter disgust. "Why have you only got one
boot on? Bootmaker," he shouted, without leaving me
time to reply, "can't you find a pair of boots for this
man?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the bootmaker, who had hurried up
at the officer's command, "he's got an instep like I've
never seen."</p>

<p>"What business has a cripple like you in my squadron?"
angrily remarked the Captain.</p>

<p>"But, sir&mdash;&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shut up," he howled; "if you answer me again I'll
send you straight off to the cells!" and without looking at
my trousers, he angrily told me to put on my tunic, which
I had removed at his orders. I did so, and was then
ordered to fold my arm over my chest. "What's that?"
said the Captain; "how dare you come and show me such
a tunic? Are you such a fool as not to see for yourself
it's too small?"</p>

<p>Warned by previous experience I made no reply, and
returned limping with my single boot to the tailor. I
explained to him that the Captain found my tunic too
small.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "I'll soon make it larger." He
pulled it about a little and sent me back to the Captain,
who once more ordered me to fold my right arm over my
chest.</p>

<p>"Sleeves too long, go and change," he said brusquely.</p>

<p>I returned to the tailor and explained matters to him.</p>

<p>"Never mind, my boy," he said; "I'll make you one
that will fit you, it won't cost you much, and, of course, you
have got money&mdash;you're a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>; now pull up your
sleeve a bit and hold it tight under your arm before the
Captain looks at you."</p>

<p>I did so.</p>

<p>"Fold your arms," once more said the Captain, when I
returned to him for inspection. I followed the tailor's instruction.
"It's too small," yelled the Captain, "go and
change."</p>

<p>Without taking the trouble of doing this, I merely walked
to where the tailor stood, and came back with the same
tunic, letting the sleeve drop a little. This time, when the
Captain examined me, he found it was a perfect fit!</p>

<p>One aspect of the grotesque muddle I have just described
is a very serious one.</p>

<p>In the event of war breaking out between France and
Germany, there is absolutely no doubt that success would
depend on the rapidity with which troops could be mobilised
in each country. While I was in the regiment, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
witnessed more than once the arrival of the men belonging
to the reserve. Although they are supposed to arrive with
one suit of uniform, which they must take home with them
after performing their act of service, their equipment has
to be handed over to them, and the process entails all
the confusion and trouble which were incurred when our
own outfit had to be given out to us. In Germany things
are very differently managed; every man belonging to the
reserve knows at what barracks he will have to report
himself, and every year the reserve men are called together
for a few hours, and shown where each man can find his
complete outfit. These are stored up in the following
way: Long rows of shelves are divided into a certain
number of partitions, each one of which contains the
complete outfit of a private, every article of clothing
having been properly fitted to the wearer, so that in case
of mobilisation each soldier would know exactly where
to go for his outfit, and no time would be wasted in
distribution, in trying on uniforms and boots, and running
from one department to the other. The object of
calling out the reserve men for a few hours yearly is
to teach them exactly where their outfit stands, and
also to try on all the garments with a view to making
any alterations rendered desirable by advancing years.
In France, on the contrary, everything would be in
confusion, and the various services, instead of helping
each other, would lose valuable time in complicated red-tapeism.</p>

<p>But to proceed:</p>

<p>I went through the same ceremony with all the other
clothes which were handed over to me. My outfit consisted
of two tunics, two pairs of trousers, one short
jacket for drill, one <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">képi</i>, and a helmet. The latter is
certainly the most comfortable head-gear in the French
army. It rests on the head by means of a broad leather
band, the ends of which are cut into strips tapering
towards the centre, where they are tied together so as to
form a kind of skull-cap, which bears the whole weight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the helmet. The latter affords a splendid protection against
the sun and rain. Although its weight is nearly double
that of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">shako</i> used by the light cavalry, it does not
cause any pressure on the forehead or on the back of the
head, as the latter invariably does. Besides the above
garments, we also received two pairs of boots, two pairs of
stable suits consisting of canvas trousers and blouse, with
a blue and white cap and a dark-blue great-coat with a
huge cape. Our regulation linen consisted of two shirts of
the coarsest material, two pairs of drawers of the same
stuff, two towels, and, besides these, two pairs of thick
white leather gloves. (All soldiers being supposed to have
hands of the same size, the regulation gloves are invariably
"nines.") Socks form no part of the regulation outfit; the
men usually replace them by bits of rag, which are nicknamed
"Russian socks." To complete the list of our wearing
apparel, I must mention an enormous pair of wooden
clogs for use in the stables, and a canvas bag into which our
outfit was shoved; having received this, we were told to
carry it on our shoulders to our rooms. We did not receive
our arms until the following day, when each of us was
given a carbine and a straight sword about four feet long,
besides a small box of tools with which to take the carbine
to pieces. At the same time we received our various
trappings&mdash;a sword-belt with brass buckles, a sword-strap,
a carbine-strap, and a cartridge-box (which in my time was
slung over the shoulder and across the breast and back of
the trooper). The next day our saddlery and stable gear
were served out to us. The saddles then in use were still
the discarded ones which had been bought from the British
Government in 1870. These saddles had a high and
straight wooden back, behind which the portmanteau was
attached. This portmanteau was round and made of blue
cloth with a red grenade at each end. Two holsters
with miscellaneous straps, a leather bag containing a spare
iron, and an open cord-girth completed our saddle fittings.
The bridle was similar to that used in the English army,
with bit and snaffle so contrived that, by removing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
straps holding the bit, the head-stall remained on the
horse, the snaffle being passed through the rings of the
head-stall. Our stable outfit consisted in a currycomb, a
soft brush, a hard brush, a chamois leather, a sponge, and
a comb for mane and tail, the whole being enclosed in a
small canvas bag.</p>

<p>To return to my first day in the regiment. Having
brought back all my gear to the room, I was informed by
the Corporal that all the things would have to be marked
with the number which had been assigned to me. The
clothes, linen, and all articles of wear I was supposed to
mark, myself, with stencils which could be obtained from
the Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i>. I entrusted, however, the two men
who had arranged to clean my things with this tedious
work, as I was, myself, most anxious to get into the town.
Of course I had to be in uniform. Full dress had to be
worn after noon. I therefore borrowed clothes, a helmet,
a sword, and even a pair of boots, from my two orderlies;
and I received instructions how to behave in the streets.
I had to carry my sword in my left hand, the hilt turned
downwards and a few inches behind my hip, the tip of the
scabbard in front of me. In case I should meet any
Corporal, non-commissioned officer, or officer, whether
they belonged to my regiment or not, I was to salute them
with the right hand, the elbow lifted high in the air, two
steps before reaching them, bringing my hand down only
when I had passed two steps beyond them. It was not
without difficulty that I managed to get down the stairs
into the barrack yard, and I found it still more difficult to
walk about. The enormous weight and width of my
trousers, the looseness of the boots which had been lent to
me, their high heels and the spurs which caught at every
step in the leather coverings of my elephantine trousers,
the tightness of the tunic under the arms, and the wobbling
of the helmet, which was much too big for me, conspired
to produce such a state of discomfort and insecurity that I
only managed to walk with legs apart and arms held
stiffly away from my body. I could hardly manage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hold my sword with my No. 9 gloves, which were, moreover,
as stiff as a board; and I felt as awkward as a man
who, for the first time in his life, tries to walk across a
tight-rope. I had just reached, with much difficulty, the
gate of the barracks, and was going to walk out, when a
stentorian voice proceeding from the guard-room suddenly
stopped me.</p>

<p>"Hullo, you recruit, where are you going?" I looked
over my shoulder and saw the Sergeant of the Guard.
I turned round, saluted, and nearly lost my balance in
doing so. "Come here, you booby!" shouted the
Sergeant. He examined me from head to foot. "Right
about turn!" he then said to me. It was easier said
than done; but I was already walking off when the
Sergeant called me anew. "Where are you going?"
he said.</p>

<p>"Well, Sergeant, I am going into the town."</p>

<p>"Oh, really, are you? Turn round first, I want to
look at your back." I turned and stood there for a minute
or two. "Go back to your room," said the Sergeant at
last.</p>

<p>"But, Sergeant," I replied, "I thought that we were
allowed to go out."</p>

<p>"Go back to your room," he said, laughing, "and ask
your Corporal why I won't let you go out." Disconsolately
I trudged back to the room. There I was greeted with a
roar of laughter from all the troopers.</p>

<p>"So," they exclaimed, "the Sergeant has sent you
back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but why?" All the men shouted with laughter.
I confess that I felt rather foolish.</p>

<p>"Come here, you recruit," good-naturedly said one of
them at last, "let me brush you." And so saying he
vigorously applied a brush to my back. It appears that
before I went out one of the troopers had drawn a huge
chalk cross on my tunic. I then learnt that before leaving
barracks, every trooper must present himself before the
Sergeant of the Guard, who has to examine him, and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that he is properly groomed; if anything is amiss in his
uniform the Sergeant sends him back to put himself
straight. This, I may add, often leads to considerable
abuse of their power by certain Sergeants, for when one of
them has a grudge against a man he will send him back
five or six times to his room without telling him what
he considers wrong in his attire&mdash;the regulations in no
way compelling the Sergeant to explain to the trooper
where he considers that the fault lies. I have seen a
trooper sent back in this way to his room no less than
eight times running.</p>

<p>It was a pouring wet day, and when for the ninth time
the Sergeant ordered him to return the trooper implored
him to tell him what was wrong.</p>

<p>"You dirty pig," replied the Sergeant, "look at your
boots, they are covered with mud." The trooper, it must
be mentioned, had to walk over a hundred yards from his
room across the courtyard before reaching the gate, and
irritated beyond measure by the injustice of the Sergeant,
he asked, in a sarcastic tone, whether he was expected to
carry an umbrella.</p>

<p>"If you like," added the man, "I'll go and fetch my
brushes and brush my boots here, and then perhaps
you will be satisfied?" For that answer the Sergeant
gave the man four days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, stating in his
report as a reason for that punishment that "the trooper,
after presenting himself nine times before the Sergeant
of the Guard in a disgraceful state of filth, had grossly
insulted the Sergeant who had remonstrated with him."
The trooper had often been punished before, and held a
bad record, so, upon reading the Sergeant's report, the
Colonel altered the punishment into thirty days' prison.</p>

<p>But to return to myself. When I appeared once more
before the Sergeant of the Guard, that non-commissioned
officer, who was not a bad fellow after all, laughed at the
trick that had been played on me and allowed me to go
out.</p>

<p>I shall always remember that first outing. I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
realised how grotesque a figure I was cutting, until I met
another <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> in the same plight as myself. I had,
besides, been so terrified by the warning I had received
not to fail to salute Corporals, especially of the infantry&mdash;as
a feud always exists between infantry and cavalry&mdash;that
whenever I saw a soldier with a red woollen stripe
on his sleeve, I saluted at once. For this I was unmercifully
chaffed by some troopers of my squadron who
happened to pass while I was solemnly saluting an
infantry man just adorned. They ultimately explained
to me that only men with two stripes held the rank of
Corporal, while those who had but a single stripe were
merely first-class privates&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, men drawing higher pay
for good conduct. For my blunder I had to pay a fine
to my comrades, taking them to the nearest café to have
a drink.</p>

<p>Although we were not allowed to have rooms in
the town, most of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> had engaged lodgings
before joining the regiment. As I have already said, I
had engaged a room at the Crown Hotel, and, as every
year the best set among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> had been in the
habit of putting up there, special accommodation was reserved
for them: even a private dining-room was retained
for us, and when I arrived there that evening, I found
six of my comrades having an appetiser in our special
room. They were all young men of good and well-known
families: besides Walter, of whom I have already spoken,
there were Cuffet, whose father had been a Cabinet
Minister a few years before; Pager de la Tasherie, whose
father had been an Ambassador; Meix, now the head of
one of the largest engineering firms in France; de Nevers,
who succeeded, some years ago, to a dukedom, and a
couple of others, also of gentle birth. The greatest
comfort we found at the hotel was the possibility of
getting a tub, for we soon discovered the absolute lack
of sanitary arrangements in our barracks. We had a
pleasant dinner that night, and having taken off our tight-fitting
tunics, we almost felt like civilised beings. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
were, however, soon recalled to the reality of our position
by the rolling of drums and the sounding of bugles.
It was the tattoo. In every French garrison town,
a quarter of an hour before soldiers have to be in
barracks, the trumpeters, and, if there is an infantry
regiment in the place, the buglers and drummers, assemble
in the principal square and thence march back to
barracks playing the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">retraite</i>. We hurried over our
coffee and returned to barracks. For fear of being late
we walked as fast as we could, but one or two of us got
entangled in our spurs or fell head over heels over our
swords.</p>

<p>I cannot possibly give an adequate idea of the horrible
stench which caught me by the throat when I opened the
door of "my" room. Imagine the odour of 80 human
beings, 79 of which had not had a bath within the last
three months, add to that the emanations from 160 pairs
of boots which had been in use for an average of three
years, sheets that had not been changed for a month, and
crown the mixture with a smell of stables rising through
the floor (our room stood over a stable containing 100
horses), and you will perhaps be able to gather a faint
idea of what the place smelt like. Five minutes after the
trumpeters had returned to barracks the evening "call"
took place. In the cavalry, troopers are not called by
their individual names in the evening; but every trooper
has either to stand at the foot of his bed in uniform if he
has been out, or in stable dress if he has not left barracks,
or else he can be in bed if he chooses. The Sergeant of
the Week walks through the room, each Corporal having
to report with reference to absent men, whether they are
on guard, or stable duty, on leave, or missing. When
the Sergeant has been the round of a room, the men can
do what they like throughout the barracks until 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
when they must all be in bed at the bugle call of "Lights
out." In my time the night call was at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, but since
General Boulanger was Minister of War soldiers have
been allowed to stop out until 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> After the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
call we changed our clothes and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> collected
in the canteen. This consisted of a large room, 30 feet
by 20; a long table stood in the middle of it, with smaller
tables on each side, forms running alongside of each. A
kitchen opened on to this room, and the place was
crowded. If the smell of our living-rooms was bad, the
smell of the canteen was equally so: burnt fat, onions,
garlic, wine, and bad tobacco furnished its chief components.
A large number of men, and almost every Corporal of the
various squadrons in which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were serving,
were collected in the canteen in the hope&mdash;which was not
deceived&mdash;of getting drinks from us. They chiefly appreciated
red wine, which was sold at fivepence and sixpence
a quart, superior wine fetching eightpence a quart.
Brandy could be had at a halfpenny a glass, or 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>
the quart. These prices left a very good margin of
profit to the canteen-keeper, as all wines and spirits
sold in French barracks are exempt from excise duty.
A table had been reserved for us, and there the fourteen
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> who were serving that year met in the
evening.</p>

<p>That night our chief topic of discussion related to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bienvenue</i> (welcome), a canteen banquet offered by the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> to the men and Corporals of their respective
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pelotons</i>. It was at length settled that this should take
place on the following Friday.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, when the trumpeters sounded "Lights
out," we returned to our respective rooms, and for the
first time I was taught how to get into a military bed.
To do this properly is a fine art. The bed, as I have
already mentioned, was about two feet eight inches
broad, and to guard against its occupant tumbling out
blankets and sheets are tightly tucked under the straw
mattress. In order to get in you have therefore to
stand at the head of your bed, and to gently pull yourself
inside as if you were getting into a bag. I got halfway
down satisfactorily, but then, notwithstanding my
efforts, I was unable to make further progress. Suspecting
that a practical joke had been played on me, I got out of
bed, and soon found that it had been prepared apple-pie
fashion. While I was examining my bed, I heard, not far
from me, a tremendous noise, and saw the bed of one of
my comrades rolling bodily on the floor. This is another
favourite trick played on recruits, and easily accomplished.
The bed consisting of three boards perched on two iron
trestles, by pulling sharply the trestle which stands under
the foot of the bed, the whole of it can be precipitated
forward; while the sleeper, thus suddenly aroused,
is further terrified by seeing the Corporal (who usually is
a party to the joke) near him, threatening to send him to
the cells for kicking up a row. In the present case the
sufferer was the impecunious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> whom I have
already mentioned. The poor fellow had to make his bed
anew in the dark&mdash;no easy matter.</p>

<div class="caption">DRAGOON SITTING ON HIS BED EATING FROM MESS-TIN</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>So far as I was concerned, I turned my attention to
one of the troopers who had undertaken to look after me.
He was a Parisian, a former street arab, and I suspected
him of having prepared an apple-pie bed in order to
have a laugh at me. He pretended to be fast asleep,
although I called him two or three times; but I struck a
match and caught him grinning. In order therefore to
make him heed me, I went to the foot of his bed and,
seizing the iron trestle, determined to bring the whole
affair to the floor if he did not get up. This soon aroused
him.</p>

<p>"Look here, old chap," he exclaimed, "you don't try
any of these 'ere jokes on your seniors, or else you'll smart
for it."</p>

<p>"Well, Titi," I replied, "you've got to make my bed
over again, so, after all, the joke you wanted to play
on me has been wasted, for it only gives you extra
trouble."</p>

<p>At first he declined to touch my things, but, as I warned
him that if he didn't do it he'd never get another tip from
me, he reluctantly set to work. It took me a pretty long
time to go to sleep that night; my neighbour snored like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
a pug dog, and a goodly number of the eighty men who
slept in the same room as myself, besides snoring,
emitted such an atrocious effluvium that I did not feel
able to go to sleep. It takes some time, too, to get
accustomed to the noise of stables, and I could hear quite
distinctly the chargers below constantly kicking their
stalls; at last, however, I dropped to sleep from sheer
exhaustion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>


<p>At 5 o'clock in the morning I was aroused by a loud
shouting; it was the Corporal of the Week who was passing
through the room calling out, "Any sick men here?"
The names of the men who want medical attention have to
be put down on the Sergeant-major's morning report, on
which also figures the morning call, which is merely
nominal, as it never takes place in the cavalry. Half an
hour later the trumpeters sounded the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réveille</i> and immediately
the various Corporals told off a certain number of
men to go and clean the stables. I was one of those
selected. Hastily I donned my stable suit, of coarse
canvas, and when I reached the stables, was told off to clean
the straw under four horses&mdash;my comrade Titi, who had
accompanied me, being ordered to show me how to proceed.
Neither pitchforks nor shovels are used, the men having
to separate with their hands the dry from the wet straw,
and having also to pick out with their fingers whatever
dung may be mixed with the litter. I scarcely relished
this unsavory work, and as I did not consider it likely to
improve in any way my military training, I tipped Titi a
franc to do it for me, while I went to the canteen to have
a cup of coffee and a crust of bread. It may be noted here
that before <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réveille</i> a jug of very thin coffee, with a pretence
of sugar added to it, was brought into the rooms, but few
of the men cared to touch it. Those who were unable to
afford the canteen preferred to break their fast with a glass
of water and a slice of bread&mdash;not that the charges of the
canteen were high, for a cup of coffee (so called) and a roll
of bread costs but three halfpence&mdash;but there exists an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
unwritten but inviolable law that no man may take a drink
of any kind by himself. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faire suisse</i> is the term used to
describe the fact of going to the canteen alone, and this is
considered a real crime, to be severely punished by the
rest, so that a poor fellow who gets a few francs monthly
from his people must always share them with a comrade.
It is also a curious fact that, although most men complain
of the scarcity of the food supplied to them, few will ever
spend in victuals the money they may receive from home&mdash;they
invariably consume it in drink.</p>

<p>At 6 o'clock the trumpets sounded "Stables," so fetching
the bags containing our implements we returned to the
stables to groom our chargers. Every man has often two
horses to groom&mdash;his own charger as well as the horse of
any trooper who may be on guard, or otherwise employed.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Our chargers had not yet been allotted to us, so I was told
to groom a lively little mare, which I afterwards found out
enjoyed the reputation of being the most vicious charger
of the whole squadron; however, whether it was that I
was not afraid of her, or that she instinctively felt that I
loved horses, we got on very well together. The grooming
lasted for an hour, and towards 7 o'clock the Lieutenant of
the Week turned up and gave orders for the horses to be
taken to the watering-tanks. As I was leading out the
mare I had been grooming I was ordered by the Lieutenant
to also lead two other chargers; holding their reins in my
right hand, I tried to jump on the bare back of the little
mare&mdash;she was called "Durance" after the name of a torrent
in the South of France, and she well deserved her appellation.
The moment I caught hold of her mane to jump on
her back she plunged, and, jumping back a few steps, nearly
brought her reins over her head. Twice she played me
the same trick, and at the same time the other horses,
whose reins I held, pulled away from her, but the third
time I landed on her back, and although she tried buck-jumping,
I easily rode her with the other animals to the
watering-tank. When I returned she was lively enough,
but it was all play and not vice: and when I jumped off
her back the Lieutenant called me:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>"How do you like the mare?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Very much indeed, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Would you like her as your charger?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the officer, "you shall have her, as
you seem to be able to ride."</p>

<p>I was quite delighted, and very soon made friends with
the little beast (she was hardly 15 hands high); she came
to know me so well that at the end of a few months she
used to follow me about like a dog. She was, it is true, very
vicious at times, and would not let certain men come near
her; she also had a hatred of officers, as years before she
had been one of the Surgeon-major's chargers, and the
fellow used to thrash her unmercifully. She was one of the
oldest chargers in the regiment&mdash;being eighteen years old&mdash;and
originally came from Hungary, where many horses
were bought just after the Franco-Prussian war, but notwithstanding
her age, she was full of "go" and of play. We
became such good friends that many a time when I was
on stable guard I used to lie alongside of her, my head
resting on her neck, and she would remain quite still for
hours until I moved. I always bought extra food for her,
and kept her in tip-top condition.</p>

<p>After "Stables" we were taken to get our arms and
saddlery, and shown how to take our carbines to pieces
and put them together again. We then had the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gras
carbine</i>, which has long since been discarded.</p>

<p>At the call of "Soup" (10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>) the troopers rushed off
to the kitchen, and wishing to taste regimental food, I told
Titi to bring me my ration, and waited until it arrived. In
those days food came from the kitchen in what was called
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamelle</i>&mdash;a stout tin pot in the shape of a saucepan,
without a handle, but with a tin cover. Each man found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
his ration ready in the kitchen, with an allowance of salt
on the lid of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamelle</i>; the fare consisted that morning
of thin soup which tasted like sloppy water in which dishes
might have been washed, with lumps of bread soaked in it
and a little fat floating about in cold lumps. At the bottom
of the pan was a bit of bone with very little meat on it,
the ration of meat allowed to each man being four ounces
including bone. The mere sight of that so-called soup
and the filthiness of the pan which contained it, was too
much for me. However ill-fed the men were, very few of
them could ever finish the whole of their ration. When a
man had finished eating he chucked his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamelle</i> into a
corner, a trooper being told off every day to take the tins
back to the kitchen. In my time men had to feed on their
beds, but since the days of General Boulanger things
have, as I stated before, greatly altered. The men now
eat at table, the food is served in dishes, and the man at
the head of each table, who is generally a Corporal, helps
each man on his own enamelled plate.</p>

<p>To return to my own experiences: I went to the
canteen to get something to eat. Most of the other
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were already there, and, although the place
was horribly dirty, I ate with great relish a couple of
cutlets. We tried the various brands of wine; that
at fivepence a bottle was more suitable for use as a
dye than as a beverage, but the one at sixpence was
quite drinkable, and the one at eightpence quite equal
to the so-called claret sold at two shillings a bottle
in second-rate London restaurants. We discovered that
the canteen-keeper had a yet better brand at a shilling a
bottle, and this was really very good. It was a genuine
bottled wine, and not drawn from the cask like the others.
During my stay in the regiment I was much struck with
the fact that hardly any beer is drunk by Frenchmen
belonging to the lower classes. To see troopers drinking
it was quite exceptional; wine was their staple drink,
except when they wanted to get drunk, in which case they
went in for brandy, which was served in flasks holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
about two-thirds of a pint and costing fourpence. It took
about a pint and a quarter of this stuff to have the desired
effect.</p>

<p>It was nearly 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> before we had finished our breakfast,
and I then returned to my quarters, most anxious to
have a wash, which I had so far been obliged to do
without. I asked Titi where the lavatory was.</p>

<p>"Lavatory!" he laughed out; "his highness wants a
lavatory. You'll get a lavatory in barracks, old chap.
What else do you want?&mdash;a valet to dress your royal
highness?"</p>

<p>"But," I said, "isn't there any place where I can go
and have a wash?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, there's the pump!"</p>

<p>This seemed rather unsatisfactory, and I could hardly
believe it to be the case, so I went to the room of my
friend Sergeant de Lanoy and asked him about it.</p>

<p>"It's quite true, old man," he replied; "lavatories do exist
in the barracks, but they have never been utilised since
'70, and are now used for storing straw, so that the only
place where you can go and have a wash is at the pump. If
I were alone in my room," he added, "I would lend it to
you, but the other Sergeant who lives with me is a beast,
and he would kick up a row if he found you performing
your ablutions here."</p>

<p>I had therefore to go to the pump, and fortunately found
a bucket near at hand, so that I managed to wash at least
the upper portion of my body.</p>

<p>There is in each squadron a barber, who has to
shave, free of cost, every trooper twice a week; but
the mere sight of the fellow, to say nothing of his
implements, was enough. It is impossible to realise how
men can live in the state of filth which seems natural
to French soldiers. Hardly one of them ever thinks of
washing his hands after cleaning the stables in the way
I have previously described; occasionally some of them
wash their faces, necks, and hands on Sundays, or
when they have to appear on parade, but many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
remain all the year round (except in the summer season,
when they are sent in batches to the swimming baths)
without taking a single bath or feeling the want of one.
It will be seen how, later on, when we were permanently
consigned to barracks, I had to get special
leave from the doctor to be able to go out and have a
bath in the town.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock we were all taken to the dispensary to
be vaccinated, vaccination being compulsory throughout
the French army. That operation concluded, we were
taught to fold our clothes and shown how to arrange them
on the shelves above our bed. At 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> we returned to
stables, after which the Sergeant-major made us stand in
circle round him while the regimental orders of the day
were read out by the Corporal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i>, all the punishments
inflicted upon officers, non-commissioned officers, and
troopers being announced at the end of the orders.</p>

<p>It has always struck me as a great mistake to let privates
learn the punishments inflicted upon officers, as this, of
course, tends to lower them in the eyes of their men. That
day, for instance, I was much astonished to hear that one
of the Captains of the regiment had been punished by the
Colonel with fifteen days of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrêts de rigueur</i> (strict confinement
to his room, with a sentry in front of his door)
"for," said the orders, "having been seen walking about
in a drunken state, with his uniform in disarray, at ten
o'clock at night." This Captain was greatly hated by the
men, and it is needless to say that they all rejoiced at the
punishment which had been inflicted upon him, expressing
their feelings in the coarsest language.</p>

<p>"Stables" over, we hurried to the town, and our set
met as usual at the Crown Hotel, where we exchanged
impressions on military service. We were all unanimous
in declaring it a filthy and disgusting ordeal. After the
evening call, we entertained our respective Corporals at
the canteen, most of them having to be supported back
to their beds.</p>

<p>The following day was enlivened by the arrival of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
ordinary recruits coming to serve their five years. Most
of them came from Paris, and belonged to the worst set of
ruffians imaginable. A few were countrymen, among whom
were two or three stupid "Bretons" coming from the
remotest parts of Brittany. One of the latter was assigned
a bed next to the "old 'un," and therefore close to mine.
As soon as he had eaten his evening meal, he sat on his
bed, weeping bitterly, and as I asked him the cause of his
grief he began with deep sobs:</p>

<p>"Our poor Jeanne; it's the day she ought to calve, and
to think that I shall not be near her! If you saw that
cow, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! it's a cow!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and when she calves she won't take any food
except from my hand, and now I am here, and she calving!
My poor Jeanne, my poor Jeanne!"</p>

<p>I tried to console him, but it was in vain. Of course,
the other troopers made great fun of him, and one of them
remarked that if his cow was as ugly as himself, and as ill-fed,
she must be a hideous beast indeed. This drove the
fellow into an absolute frenzy, and, seizing the sword
hanging at the head of my bed, he would have made
deadly use of it had I not forcibly prevented him.</p>

<p>The recruits went, that day, through the routine we had
undergone on the day of our arrival&mdash;the only difference
being that they were marched in batches to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capitain-tresorier's</i>
office under the command of a Sergeant&mdash;and
before evening every one of them had been drafted into a
squadron, each recruit being put under the care of a
trooper of at least a year's standing, who had to teach his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bleu</i> (recruit) what to do. The recruits, upon receiving
their outfit, have to hand over their civilian clothes, which
are sold by auction. This rule did not, however, apply to
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, but we had to remove our civilian clothes
out of barracks, and were, under no circumstances, allowed
to wear anything but uniform.</p>

<p>That year the recruits numbered about 125, or twenty-five
to each squadron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>That night the most elaborate practical jokes were
played on the new-comers. First of all an "artful dodger,"
a typical Parisian blackguard, attired himself in a great
coat and an old cocked hat; alongside of him marched two
troopers with swords, helmets, and carbines, but devoid
of all clothing. The "Artful dodger" went to the bed
of each one of the recruits. "Get up," said another
trooper, "here comes the surgeon-major." "You are a
recruit, my boy?" queried the "Artful dodger." "Yes,
sir," usually replied the recruit, rather awed. "Don't
call me 'sir,'" went on the tormentor, "call me 'Monsieur
le Major.'" (The way in which military surgeons are
addressed.) "Get out of bed," he went on, "and be
sharp about it." If the recruit declined to obey, he was
dragged out of his bed by other troopers and stripped;
many foul questions were then put to him, and the
joke ended by his body being blackened all over with
a blacking-brush if he took the proceedings ill. When
the recruits had gone back to bed, the "dodger" and
his companions proceeded to play other jokes on them.</p>

<p>In order to enable my readers to understand what took
place, it is necessary to recall the description of our
rooms. These apartments were about 100 feet long,
with two partitions on each side of the centre, and rows
of beds standing on each side of these partitions, which
were from 10 to 12 feet high. The "dodger" and his
companions, taking a forage-rope, with which every
trooper is provided, tied a slip-knot around the bed of
the recruit, so as to encircle the three boards forming
the base of the bed as well as the mattress and the feet
of the man inside it; the end of the rope was then
thrown over the partition, being grasped on the other
side by three or four men, while the "artful one" was
peeping round the corner to see that the man had not
moved. He then gave a whistle, the rope was smartly
pulled, and the recruit's bed instantly stood straight up
against the wall, the man inside it being tightly imprisoned
with his feet held up in the air by the slip-knot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and his head downwards. After leaving him for a
few minutes in this uncomfortable position, the rope was
suddenly slackened, and bed and man crashed with a
great noise to the floor. This was called "sending
a man to heaven," and the unfortunate victim could
not possibly find out who was responsible for the
"joke."</p>

<p>Another trick consisted in sticking a carbine-rod
between the shelf and the clothes on it, over the recruit's
head, so that the end of the rod projected above the
fellow's face; a drinking-cup filled with water was then
slung from the gun-rod by two strings fastened round
its rim, while a third and independent string attached its
handle to the rod. A piece of lighted paper was then
placed on the top of the water, and before it had time to
go out, it burnt the two first strings, tilting the water
down as the cup remained suspended by its handle.
The half-minute or so which elapsed between the lighting
of the paper and the burning of the strings, enabled
the men who had played the trick to get back to bed,
so that the poor fellow whose face had been deluged
with water was unable to find out who his persecutors
were.</p>

<p>In every case when the recruit made a noise, the
Corporal, who was invariably a consenting party to these
rough "amusements," came forward and threatened to
send him to the cells for disturbing his comrades. Of
course, to complain to the officers was considered by the
troopers a heinous crime, and whoever did so was never
tempted to adopt that course again.</p>

<p>That same night one of the recruits whose bed had
been sent "heavenwards" rushed to the Sergeant's room
and complained. The Sergeant came to our quarters,
and shouted in a loud voice, "Look here, you fellows,"
"here's a recruit who has come to complain to me of
having been bullied, as we have all been on joining the
regiment; you had better leave him alone, and don't let
him disturb me any more." Thereupon, knowing well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
what the result would be, the Sergeant retired to his
room. Immediately a blanket was produced round which
from twelve to fifteen men stood holding it, while four
other men collared the recruit and chucked him into it.
Before he knew where he was, he had been sent flying
up to the ceiling, and as soon as he dropped into the
blanket was again sent up, the operation being repeated
a dozen times until all the breath had nearly left the poor
fellow's body. The same misfortune, I am sorry to say,
befell me that very night. A trooper from the second
squadron, whose room was close to mine, sneaked in
and pulled my bed down. I saw him go back to his
room, and as soon as he had got under the blankets
without noticing me, I pulled his bed down with a
crash; but some other fellows had seen me, and, unfortunately
for myself, I was ignorant at the time of the
unwritten law that no practical jokes may be played on
the men of a squadron different from one's own, so,
before I realised where I was, I was chucked into a
blanket and tossed more than once into the air. I must,
however, add that the thing was purely done as a joke,
and with no ill-feeling&mdash;the bed, indeed, that I had
pulled down was that of my friend, Walter. I found it
by no means a disagreeable sensation to be tossed in a
blanket, but I can quite understand that a repetition of
the performance, a dozen times or more, may shake a
man more than he may like.</p>

<p>The following day we began to drill. After morning
stables we were hurried to our rooms. We kept on our
stable-dress, but had to exchange our clogs for boots,
although we were allowed to wear ordinary shoes if we
possessed any. We assembled in the barrack-square,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> and recruits together, and three or four of us
were told off under the orders of a Corporal, who proceeded
to explain to us the difference between our left and
right leg. However absurd this may seem, it is absolutely
necessary in the case of many recruits coming from
remote districts in the provinces, and I have known some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of them to take a fortnight before they realised the difference
between left and right.</p>

<p>We went through the various preliminaries of drill, we
were taught to stand in line, to execute "By the left quick
march," "Right turn," "Left turn," "Right about turn,"
and so on&mdash;preliminary exercises, which are the same in
all the armies of the world. At the end of two hours,
at the call of "Soup," we were to our great relief at last
dismissed.</p>

<p>At 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> we were put through the first elements of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltige</i> (circus-riding). A specially-trained horse was
brought into the riding-school, and while its foreleg was
held up by a trooper, the others had to jump on its back
from behind, leap-frog fashion. It was most amusing to
see the efforts of some of the recruits to accomplish this
feat, most of them at first rushing as hard as they could
towards the horse, and ending by merely striking their
noses against its tail; as, however, every man who failed to
ultimately succeed in getting on the horse's back was sent
to sleep in the cells, very few of us remained unsuccessful.
We were afterwards placed on a bare-backed horse
around which was buckled a surcingle with two handles&mdash;a
non-commissioned officer holding the animal at the end of
a long rope so as to make him canter in a circle. We had
to jump on and off while the animal was cantering, and
those who failed, or did not try their best, were usually
rewarded with a smart cut from the huge circus-whip
which the non-commissioned officer carried in his hand.
We had also to repeat the same performance on a broad
circus saddle, and many were those who, taking too
powerful a spring, were sent flying outside the circle.
These were merely preliminary exercises, however, and I
will describe later on others we were called upon to do in
the same way.</p>

<p>Among the recruits there was one so clumsy that he
could never manage to alight on the horse's back, and no
amount of assistance seemed to be of any use to him. The
sergeant threatened to send the man to the lock-up, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
looked so helplessly stupid, and made such simple and
amusing excuses, that his instructor could not find it in
his heart to punish him. When placed on the bare-backed
steed, he clung to the surcingle like a monkey,
and upon being told to jump off, he rolled like an untidy
bundle to the ground. The Sergeant began to lose his
temper, and warned the man that if he failed to get on
again he would certainly be punished. Thereupon the
recruit caught hold of the handle and ran round the ring
alongside of the cantering horse; at last, with a mighty
effort, he got his knee upon the animal's back and finally
sat there, looking half exhausted.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Sergeant, "you see you can do it; jump
off and try again."</p>

<p>Clumsily the recruit got down, and tripping, fell on his
knees at the Sergeant's feet.</p>

<p>"Now then, up you get!" cried the Sergeant; "jump on
once more."</p>

<p>"Jump on?" replied the recruit dreamily, as though
just aroused from a reverie; "well, here goes!"</p>

<p>And so saying, he took a mighty bound, and alighted on
his feet on the back of the cantering horse! In another
moment, turning a splendid somersault, he reached the
ground, and stood composedly before the astonished
Sergeant, amidst universal laughter and applause.</p>

<p>"You have been fooling me!" cried the latter, when he
could find words.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Sergeant," said the fellow in reply; "you
see, it isn't easy for a man to forget his business all at
once; and the fact is, I have been a clown. Houp-la!"
And, taking a short run, he this time turned a somersault
right over the still cantering horse. I may add that the
ex-clown became a great favourite with all the officers,
and was certainly one of the most wonderful trick-riders I
have ever seen.</p>

<p>After <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltige</i> we were allowed some rest, and before
"Stables" we had an hour's physical drill. This consisted
of bending the body downwards with extended arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
bending the knees with uplifted arms, and other exercises
which are taught in every English and foreign gymnasium.
A curious part of the performance consisted, however, in
the principles of French boxing. The position in which
we were placed would have been the joy of any English
schoolboy; we were told to put our legs well apart, one
foot twenty inches behind the other, the left arm level
with our chin, and the right arm a little lower. The first
movement consisted in striking forward with the right
fist. We then had to bring forward the right leg, which
had been extended the whole time behind the left; as we
brought the right leg forward we had to strike it against
the calf of our left leg, so as to give a powerful kick with
the heel, which then described a circle, bringing our right
foot twenty inches behind the left. Such is what is called
"French boxing."</p>

<p>In the evening, after "Soup," we were taken to the
riding-school, having to dress for the purpose in undress
uniform&mdash;namely, the red trousers with leather covering
which I have previously described, a short jacket, a képi,
and white gloves&mdash;pieces of rags being tied round the
rowels of our spurs. We were first taught how to dress
in line, and how to stand at our horse's head. At the
command of "Prepare to mount!" we had to take a long
step backwards, slipping the reins through our left hand
and catching hold of the mane with it while we seized the
pommel of the saddle with the right, and at the command
"Mount!" we had to raise ourselves well up (our weight
resting on the wrists), and then throw the right leg over
the saddle. Many of us were unable to get on our horses
in this way without a good deal of shoving up by the
Corporals. Once on our horses, the position we had to
assume was explained, and we were also taught how to
hold our reins and how to direct our animals (we had only
a snaffle on our bridles). We were then marched in
Indian file after a Corporal all round the riding-school.
Most of the recruits knew something about horses, as
those drafted into the cavalry are usually picked out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
amongst farm hands, carters, or men who have had something
to do with stables. Some of them, however, had
never been on a horse in their lives, and when the command
"Trot!" was given, two or three very soon tumbled
off. I had been warned beforehand by my friend, De
Lanoy, that the looseness and roughness of our military
trousers would cause me serious abrasions unless I adopted
a plan which had succeeded admirably with him. I had
accordingly brought with me when I joined the regiment
a few pairs of thin doeskin riding-breeches, which I put on
before dressing to go to the riding-school, and over these
I pulled my trousers, an easy matter if one considers the
abnormal size of the latter. I congratulated myself many
a time afterwards upon having adopted this plan, as I was
the only man who never was galled.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour we were dismissed, and having
taken back our horses to the stables, we were shown how
to rub them down with straw, and we then returned to our
room, carrying our saddles on our heads.</p>

<p>It was that night that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bienvenue</i> (welcome supper)
was to take place. The evening "call" over, we therefore
repaired to the canteen, where the fourteen <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>
sat down with about one hundred and twenty of the
Corporals and troopers belonging to their respective
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pelotons</i>. As one canteen would not have been able to accommodate
this number, it was arranged that as there
were <i>two</i> canteens in our regiment, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> of the
first and second squadrons should give their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bienvenue</i> in
one, while those of the third and fourth squadrons would
use the other.</p>

<p>We accordingly sat down with about sixty of our
guests, the Corporals and troopers of our companies.
Tables had been laid in a large room and we crowded
around them. Cold meats, sausages, coffee, with wine
and brandy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ad libitum</i>, formed the bill of fare. As the
meal proceeded, and the men helped themselves to a
liberal quantity of wine, they became more and more
noisy. At last one of the Corporals, although very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
drunk, stood on a form and demanded "Order," adding
that the company would now be favoured with a few
songs; and at the same time calling upon anybody who
could sing to add to the pleasure of the entertainment.
Nobody responded, so, rising once more, the Corporal,
after swallowing a large glass of brandy to steady himself,
began in a drunken and cracked voice to sing a
sentimental ditty, an old and simple country song which,
although interrupted by many hiccups, was greeted with
much applause. Next came a lanky country bumpkin
whose regimental training had been unable to obliterate
his countrified appearance; he sang, with the utmost
monotony and an innumerable number of false notes, an
atrociously indecent song, the coarseness of which had
evidently never struck him. Every one of the troopers
took up the chorus, which they all sang in different keys,
but with marvellous seriousness. Then came the turn
of a Parisian ruffian, who sang in a voice of thunder an
old and also very obscene regimental song, of course
with a chorus; he could, however, not get further than
the second verse, for in the middle of this he collapsed on
the floor, and interrupted for a moment the gaiety of the
proceedings by so noisy an attack of sickness that the
whole distinguished company called for his removal.
(We found him later on soundly asleep on a dung-heap
in the barrack-yard.) After his removal, another trooper,
also a countryman, sang a religious song, with a mournful
tune, which ran into more than twenty verses, but was
greatly appreciated. At this point the delightful proceedings
were once more interrupted, this time by a fight
between two Corporals. They went for each other like
madmen, kicking, scratching, and biting one another. They
were, however, too drunk to hurt each other much, and
everything would have concluded peacefully had not the
quarrel degenerated into a free fight, which resulted in
the smashing of a good many glasses and plates, for which
we had, of course, to pay. The whole bill, however, only
amounted to about 35<i>s.</i> for each one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Before the call of "Lights out" peace had been restored,
and the whole company adjourned to their respective
rooms, most of the troopers supporting (?) one another
and collapsing a good many times on the way. I shall
never forget the scene when we got near the dung-heap.
We discovered the fellow of whom I spoke just now, fast
asleep in the mire, and four or five of his comrades
volunteered to get him out, but, being as drunk as himself,
they all fell in a heap on the top of him, and it was only
with great difficulty that they were extricated from the
filth and, in a state that I dare not describe, carried to their
room. Some of the men who were boisterously drunk
were sent to pass the night in the cells by a Corporal
who resented not having been invited, and having thus
missed the chance of a good "booze."</p>

<p>On the Friday, at 11 o'clock in the morning, the
trumpeters sounded "Forage," and we were all paraded in
the yard, each one of us carrying his forage-rope. (Sergeant
de Lanoy had previously told me that he couldn't
excuse me from this work, but he promised that he would
manage to let me slip off in the middle of it.) We were
then marched to the forage-store, some two hundred
yards away from the barracks; and there stood the officers
of the week of each squadron, whose duty it was to get
delivery of the forage required for the next seven days.
Each of the troopers was told to pick out of a heap
eight huge bundles of straw, and to fasten them together
with his forage-rope, the end of which is fitted with a
kind of metal pulley so as to form a slip-knot. The rope
being thus tied round the eight bundles of straw, we were
supposed to take the load on our shoulders and to carry
it to the squadron store. To peasants and men of the
lower classes, such as were most of the troopers, men
who had been accustomed from their boyhood to carry
heavy and cumbrous loads, this entailed merely a little
extra exertion, but to one who, like myself, had never
been used to manual work, it was almost an impossible
task. The other troopers enjoyed, of course, the sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of a gentleman carrying on his back a cumbersome weight
of nearly one hundred and sixty pounds. I did my best
to go on with it, but I had not covered fifty yards before
one of the bundles began to drop out of the heap, and
the whole load soon came to the ground. I did my best
to tie it together again, but when it came to hoisting it
on to my back I found that it was out of the question.
In vain did I ask some of the troopers who had already
carried one load, and were returning to the stores, to help
me; they all laughed, but none of them would give me a
hand. To my great relief, however, my friend Titi soon
appeared on the scene, and, telling me to wait a few
minutes, he promised that when he returned with his
own load he would relieve me of a few bundles. While
I was waiting for him a Captain chanced to pass; I
saluted him, but he did not return my salute, and merely
said:</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I cannot manage to carry my load, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Now catch hold of it at once, you blasted lazy
beggar!" he cried, standing in front of me, and waiting to
see me execute his order.</p>

<p>I renewed my efforts, but was unable to hoist the
enormous bundle on to my shoulders. The Captain then
called out to two troopers who happened to pass by: "Stick
me that load on that lazy dog's shoulders!" he said to
them. They lifted the bundle, and dropping it on the top
of my head before I was prepared for it, they brought
me to the ground under the heap. This put the Captain
in a fury; he swore at me and cursed me, and said that it
was all obstinacy on my part, and that I would "d&mdash;&mdash;d
well have to carry it." At last I managed to get it on my
shoulders, and went twenty-five yards farther with it; but
it was too much for me, and I had to put it down once
more. Fortunately, the Captain had disappeared, and
Titi soon came to my relief. Although he was carrying
seven bundles, he took three of mine, and I was then able
to carry the five remaining ones as far as the squadron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
stores. These, I found to my astonishment, to have been
originally built as a lavatory, with a number of large basins
for the use of the men. I stopped there a little while,
hoping to escape a repetition of my previous experience,
when our Sergeant-major looked into the place.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there, you lazy dog?" (The
actual expression which is constantly used in French
regimental slang, by officers and non-commissioned officers
alike, cannot be translated into English for more than one
reason.)</p>

<p>In reply to the Sergeant-major's civil question I told
him that I was putting the straw in order, but he told me
to return at once to the stores. All the straw had already
been carried away, so I was told off to carry four bundles
of hay, each one of them tied up in the shape of a ball
and weighing about fifty pounds. I told the Corporal
that I should be unable to bear such a weight, especially
considering the enormous size of the load. He abused
me, called me a lazy dog, and as he was raising his voice
an officer came to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>"The fellow refuses to carry his load," said the
Corporal.</p>

<p>"Refuses!" exclaimed the officer.</p>

<p>"No, sir," I interrupted; "I merely said that I was
unable to bear the weight of such a load."</p>

<p>The officer, who was one of the exceptionally just and
gentlemanly lieutenants in our regiment, told me to try
and carry two bundles, and to show him that I appreciated
his manner towards me, I did my best to go on
with them. I only succeeded, however, in going half
way to the barracks, and then I tipped another trooper to
carry my load as far as the stores. I escaped having to
carry any more, De Lanoy having considerately ordered
me to sweep the straw in front of the building.</p>

<p>The following days were devoted to drill, stables, and
the routine I have already described; on Sundays we had
no drill, but, unless we had obtained leave, we had to
attend stables. The first Sunday, I obtained midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
leave, so that I was able to have a quiet dinner and to
enjoy the luxury of a thoroughly good wash. The
second week passed off very much in the same way, but
at the end of it I obtained twenty-four hours' leave, so
that I was enabled to go to Paris. I can hardly describe
the delight I felt at wearing civilian clothes, in which I
felt a gentleman once more.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>


<p>At the end of about three weeks the Colonel decided to
form the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> into a separate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>, as, according
to the usual custom, they had to follow a special course of
instruction besides learning the ordinary regimental duties
of a trooper. A Sergeant, assisted by a Corporal, was
put in charge of us under a Captain selected to supervise
our instruction. Sergeant Legros, who was placed in
command of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, was well known as one of
the sulkiest brutes in the whole regiment. Our Captain,
whose name was Hermann, was the Colonel's nephew.
When this "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décision</i>" appeared in the regimental orders,
read after "Stables," all the troopers had a good laugh at us.
"Well, old chaps," they said, "now you're going to have
a grand time of it. By Jove, won't you!"</p>

<p>I went to De Lanoy's room and asked him what sort of
a fellow Legros was. De Lanoy told me that he was the
son of a small farmer, and was a stubborn, vindictive man,
who positively enjoyed punishing his men and doing a bad
turn to his fellow Sergeants whenever he got a chance.
This picture, indeed, was but too accurately drawn. Our
Captain was in command of my own squadron, and I had
already had a specimen of his manners when I went
before him to try on my clothes. Notwithstanding his
rough and abrupt manners, I must concede that he was
a gentleman; but, unfortunately, for the future he scarcely
ever came to see us, and left to the Sergeant the entire
control of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, merely signing the daily reports
drawn up by Legros. The following day the Colonel paid
one of his rare visits to the barracks, and had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> mustered in the riding-school. We waited
there for him more than an hour. When he appeared he
walked past us, surveying each one of us with a disgusted
look on his face. He was a harsh, stout, sulky looking
officer. For a few minutes he walked up and down in
front of us, talking with our Captain and striking his boot
with his riding-stick. Then, suddenly turning towards us
with one hand in his pocket and the other on the handle
of his riding-whip, which was stuck under his arm, he
addressed us.</p>

<p>"So," he said, "you're the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> who have been
sent to demoralise my regiment. Well, there are a few
things I want you to remember; you are serving five
times less than other troopers; you will therefore have
five times more work, five times more punishments, and
five times less leave than the rest." Then turning
towards the non-commissioned officer: "Dismiss your
men," he said, and at the same time he walked away
with our Captain. Before dismissing us our Sergeant
also thought fit to address us: "You are now going to
be under my orders," he began, "and you may have been
told that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> who served last year had a good
time of it, but if you think that you are going to be treated
as they were, you are jolly well mistaken. I mean to make
you work, and to make you work hard too. There are a
few hard-mouthed ones among you. I will use the curb
with them so as to soon break them in." With these
words he dismissed us.</p>

<p>As we were running off to the canteen he recalled us.</p>

<p>"At eleven o'clock," he said, "you will have to be at
the gymnasium without arms." So saying, he dismissed
us once more. It was then a quarter to eleven, so that we
hardly had any time for our food. At eleven o'clock sharp
we were all standing where he had ordered us, and the
Corporal, having dressed us in a single file, stood grumbling
at not having had time for his meal. It was raining hard,
and as the Sergeant had not appeared at the end of a
quarter of an hour, the Corporal took us inside one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
stables. Nearly three-quarters of an hour elapsed before
Legros turned up. He marched us to a room specially
reserved as a schoolroom for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, and also used as
a lecture-room for those troopers who aspired to pass the
examination necessary for obtaining the rank of Corporal.</p>

<p>At the end of the room stood a raised platform with a
desk for the Sergeant, while we sat at tables, twelve to
fourteen of which stood in pairs facing the Sergeant's
desk. Having been ordered to take our seats, we placed
ourselves as we liked, all those belonging to my set selecting
a table far away from the Sergeant's desk. He began
by giving us a list of books we were to purchase&mdash;viz.:</p>

<p>1. "General Instructions as to the Service in Barracks"
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Service Intérieur des Troupes de Cavalerie</i>).</p>

<p>2. "Cavalry Drill Regulations" (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réglement sur les
Exercices de la Cavalerie</i>).</p>

<p>3. "The Duties of Cavalry in the Field" (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Service de la
Cavalerie en Campagne</i>).</p>

<p>4. "Moral Duties of the Soldier."</p>

<p>5. "Dismounted Cavalry Drill Regulations" (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réglement
sur les Exercices de la Cavalerie à pied</i>).</p>

<p>Besides these there was another book, the title of which
I cannot remember, and which is now out of print. This
book contained most interesting information as to the composition
of the French army, the details of the rations
allowed to troopers, as well as the principles of topography,
and many other matters of use to soldiers. The Sergeant
then explained to us what our daily work would consist
in. We should no longer have to groom our horses,
except on Saturdays<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and Sundays. But this was to be
our time-table:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>As will be seen by the above, we had only two hours to
ourselves during the whole day, and we had absolutely no
chance of being able to leave barracks. We were to
begin this programme at once, but as it was necessary that
we should purchase the books of which a list had been
handed over to us, the Sergeant told us that we should
have no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltige</i> that day, but that we could, instead of it,
go to the town to purchase our books. We hurried to
dress, and at 2.30 every one of us was once more in the
schoolroom. The Sergeant, however, gave us leave to
smoke during our lectures, a concession which we all
greatly appreciated. We were first given to study "The
Moral Duties of the Soldier." This little book begins with
an outline of the origin of the first permanent French army
created by Charles VII. in 1439. It tells how this army was
recruited at first on the principle that each parish had to
supply one man, and how this small force continuously and
rapidly grew in numbers under the following reigns: how
in the time of Louis XIV. the French army already numbered
279,000 men; how Vauban, the greatest engineer
of modern times, fortified the frontiers of France, drew up
new rules for carrying on the siege of fortified places, and
was alleged to be the inventor of bayonets; how Louvois,
when he became Minister of War, compelled the officers
to be punctual in their service, improved the armaments,
erected the first barracks, established regular pay, and
devised new uniforms. The book then went on to tell us
that before the great Revolution of last century the active
army was recruited by Recruiting Sergeants; while the
provincial militia consisted of men called under the flag by
conscription, the poorer classes alone being compelled to
serve. The highest commands were granted to incapable
courtiers, commissions being exclusively granted to
noblemen; corporal punishment was in force, and the
condition of soldiers was a most miserable one. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
desertions were of constant occurrence. With the Revolution
came great changes; the provincial militia was
abolished and corporal punishment was suppressed,
bravery and military worth entitled any citizen to reach
the highest ranks; and this enabled eminent soldiers to
reveal themselves&mdash;men such as Hoche, Kléber, Desaix,
Jourdan, Masséna, Lecourbe and many others, most
of whom became Field-Marshals and Generals under
Napoleon.</p>

<p>As will be seen, the drift of all this was to try and
impress our minds with the fact that we were entirely
indebted for our present happy (?) condition to the Republic.
This sketch was read to us by the Sergeant,
who, taking no more interest in the matter than we did,
soon stopped and told us to read the remainder carefully,
while he himself proceeded to enjoy a novel. The rest
of the booklet contained a summary description of the
various wars of the Republic, and of the First Empire,
special stress being laid on the persistent antagonism of
"perfidious Albion." A brief summary of the War of '70
was also given, concluding with these words:</p>

<p>"Do not let us forget this terrible lesson; do not let
us slumber in apparent security, lest on our awakening we
find the soil of France invaded by the enemy. Let us
therefore adopt and put in practice this fine motto, the
basis of a strong army,</p>

<div class="center">"'<span class="smcap">Work and Discipline</span>.'"</div>

<p>Then came a pompous dissertation on the duties of
citizens towards <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Patrie</i>, and on the duties of soldiers
towards their superiors, beginning thus:</p>

<p>"What is subordination and discipline?" The answer
consisted of three pages of high-sounding phrases, among
which I may quote the following: "Orders must be
executed to the letter without hesitation or murmuring,
the authority from which orders come being alone responsible
for them; <i>the inferior has only the right to complain
after he has obeyed and carried out his orders</i> ... unquestioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and blind obedience is absolutely necessary to
enable every individual effort to work towards a common
aim."</p>

<p>Curiously enough, duelling is officially countenanced in
these regulations, which are still in force: "If a soldier
has been gravely insulted by one of his comrades, and
the insult has taken place in public, he must not hesitate
to claim reparation for it by a duel. He should address
his demand to his Captain, who should transmit it to
the Colonel; but it must not be forgotten that duels must
be the exception, and that a good soldier ought to avoid
quarrels." The passage relating to cleanliness is rather
interesting: "Troopers are sent to the swimming-baths
in the summer, and are allowed to have tepid baths in
winter, in order to scrape off the deposit formed on the
surface of the body by perspiration and dirt (<i>sic</i>)." I
must add that, as in many other cases, theory and practice
differ vastly, for in my time there existed but one dilapidated
bath in the whole of our barracks, where 1600 men
were quartered. No appliance for admitting hot water into
the bath existed, so that, when it had to be used for a
sick man, hot water had to be carried from the nearest
kitchen 300 yards away! I need dwell no longer on this
little book, evidently written with the best intentions, but
entirely ignored by every French soldier.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour or so the Sergeant closed his
novel, and told us to learn by heart two pages of the
regulations dealing with drill on foot. In order to show
how narrow-minded Sergeant Legros was, I must mention
that he expected us to learn <i>verbatim</i> every single sentence
of those regulations. So far as I am concerned (and I
am not the only one who suffers from this defect in
memory), I am totally unable to learn anything <i>verbatim</i>,
so that, when an hour later, the Sergeant called upon me
to recite what I had learnt, instead of reciting the following:
"At the command of 'Cavalerie en Avant&mdash;Marche,'
the trooper <i>places</i> the whole weight of his body on his
right foot, <i>after which he</i>...." &amp;c. &amp;c. I recited, "At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the command of 'Cavalerie en Avant&mdash;Marche,' the trooper
<i>puts</i> the whole weight of his body on his right foot <i>and
then</i>...." &amp;c. &amp;c. The Sergeant stopped me: "You
blockhead," he exclaimed, "what the deuce is that you are
reciting?"</p>

<p>"What you gave us to learn, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"What I gave you to learn! Go and look at your
regulations, and you'll see if it's right, and as you can't
learn the thing in an hour, you will be confined to barracks
next Sunday, and that will give you plenty of time to
ponder over it."</p>

<p>In everything we were given to learn it was always
thus. Legros cared little or nothing whether we understood
what we learnt or not, but he attached the greatest
importance to our repeating it <i>verbatim</i>, notwithstanding the
fact that he was himself unable to do so. Even when we
had to learn the principles of surveying, he expected us to
know word for word every explanation given in the book.
Later on, before we were dismissed, the Sergeant called
me up once more, and finding that this time I could answer
his question to his satisfaction, he cancelled my punishment,
telling me, however, that he would deprive me of
the right of applying for leave on the following Sunday.</p>

<p>As the routine of our daily work made it impossible for
us to dine out in future, we made an arrangement with
the canteen-keeper, who agreed to supply us with board at
the rate of £5 a month, and henceforth a table was
permanently reserved in the canteen for us.</p>

<p>We had been more than two hours in the schoolroom,
and it was with real relief that we heard the trumpeter's
call of "Soup" (dinner). Before dismissing us from
school, however, the Sergeant read us the regimental
orders for the day, which contained a reference to ourselves.
"The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>," said the Colonel, "are warned
that they are, under no circumstances, to ask for another
troopers' help, either to clean their outfits, or their arms,
or to get their horses saddled. Any <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> receiving
assistance from another trooper will have eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle
de Police</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> and the trooper who has helped him will receive
a similar punishment."</p>

<p>"Now you're warned," commented the Sergeant, "and
although I have no right to interfere with those who don't
belong to my squadron, I'll see about those among you
who are in it, and I'll take jolly good care that the
Colonel's orders are strictly carried out."</p>

<p>Here was a nice state of affairs! We had but two
hours to ourselves every day, and we were expected, not
only to take our meals during that time, but also to do work
for which an ordinary well-trained trooper was supposed
to require three to four hours of steady application! That
we could carry out the Colonel's orders was physically
impossible, and the only result was that the two men
who looked after our things insisted upon getting two
francs more a week, as a compensation for the risk of
punishment to which they were exposed.</p>

<p>That evening we had our first mounted drill in the
riding-school under our new Sergeant, and we were able
to realise what a bully the man was. He frequently kept
us trotting without rest for a quarter of an hour at a time,
though it may be remembered that we had no stirrups, and
riding as we did on hard saddles with coarse trousers
was a terrible strain on most fellows who had very little
previous training on horseback. It was then that I
appreciated the precaution I had taken of donning doeskin
riding breeches under my trousers. One of my
comrades fainted from sheer exhaustion, while three
others dropped off their horses, but every one of them
was immediately ordered to remount, and the trotting
went on for fully five minutes longer. When our Sergeant
commanded a halt and let us dismount for a few minutes'
rest, some of my comrades sat on the ground, completely
exhausted; they were coarsely rebuked, and ordered to
stand up at once, the Sergeant commanding "Attention!"</p>

<p>"There's a fine lot of troopers," he said, "who can't
even stick on a horse and trot round a riding-school
without coming a cropper! Now I warn you that, if one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of you falls off again, I'll keep you on the trot until every
blessed one of you drops from exhaustion&mdash;you blasted
recruits!" and forthwith he gave the command to "Mount,"
starting us immediately at a trot. On we went round and
round the riding-school, and God knows how long we
should have been kept on the move had not our Captain
appeared on the scene. The Sergeant's manner altered
immediately; he made us halt and spoke gently, carefully
explaining to each one of us the right position on horseback,
and while the Captain was there, never kept us
trotting or cantering for more than a couple of minutes at
a time. During one of the rests the Captain said that he
could not congratulate us, as a body, on our riding; "Out
of fourteen of you," he said, "there are not five who
understand a horse, and I see but three who can really
ride." I am glad to say that I was among the three that
he pointed out with his whip. How one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>
could ever have been foolish enough to join a cavalry
regiment passes my comprehension; the poor fellow was
absolutely ignorant of the first principles of riding; he was,
besides, terribly afraid of horses, and never managed to
get over his dread; in fact, it was through sheer luck
that he stuck on his horse for five consecutive minutes.
Hardly a day passed during the first two months of his
service without coming a cropper, although he was
allotted the quietest horse in the regiment.</p>

<p>I must mention here that our horses were changed every
day, and that, besides, while we drilled in the riding-school,
we were told to change horses in the middle of the lesson.
The first day, I was mounted on a mare, who was the
worst kicker I ever came across in my life; she could
kick so high that at times she almost stood perpendicular
with her hind legs in the air, but fortunately she had a
very tender mouth, so that with judgment and good
handling it was easy to check her antics. When we were
told to exchange horses I handed over the mare to my
neighbour, the son of a farmer, who had never ridden
anything but plough-horses; the moment he got on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
mare's back she gave a tremendous kick and he was sent
flying in the air, and turning a complete somersault he
landed on his back. He soon got up and was ordered to
mount again, but he had no sooner done so than the mare,
guessing his lack of confidence, gave another furious kick,
with her hind legs so straight in the air that he slipped
over her head to the ground, where he sat in front of his
charger. It was fortunate for him that in these two
instances the animal was immediately caught by a Corporal,
as that mare was such a vicious brute that she never
failed, after having thrown her rider, to turn round and try
to kick him. I was therefore ordered to take her back,
and having asked leave to remove the rags covering my
spur rowels, I was allowed to do so. As soon as I got on
her back she tried her kicks once more, but I gave her
such a dressing with the sharp points of my spurs, holding
her head well up at the same time, that she became as
quiet as a lamb for the remainder of the evening. I often
rode this charger afterwards, having a particular liking
for her, as she ambled easily, and one hardly moved
on her back while trotting, a great boon when one has
to ride without stirrups. When we were dismissed
that evening several of my comrades were almost
unable to walk, and one of them had his knees so
terribly scraped that he was losing a large quantity of
blood, and was literally leaving a red trail on the ground
behind him! Notwithstanding this, he was compelled to
ride the following day, as he did not wake up in time to
report himself sick, and was therefore not allowed to
attend the Surgeon-major's visit.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>


<p>So far none of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> had been punished, and it
fell to my lot to be the first to become acquainted with
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>. I had been ordered to ride that
evening the kicking mare I described just now, but the
revengeful beast, remembering the lesson I had given her
on the previous day, let out with her hind legs the
moment she saw me coming near her stall with a saddle.
I laid it on the ground and tried to get into the stall in
order to tie her head up before saddling her. Try as I
would, I could not possibly manage to get alongside of
her, the stalls being very narrow, and consisting of
wooden partitions hung up by a chain fixed to the ceiling.
These partitions, which are two feet broad, stand about
four feet from the ground, so, getting into the next stall,
I climbed over the partition and got alongside the charger
and caught her by the head-stall. A more vicious beast I
never came across; not only did she try to bite me, but
she also tried to stamp on my foot, then she kicked me
with her near hind leg, and while I was tying her head up
she gave me a forward kick with her foreleg; and when I
brought the saddle to put it on her back, she lashed out
so furiously that she broke the rope by which I had tied
her head high up and bit me viciously. She was Titi's
charger, and he alone was able to manage her, so I sent
a trooper to call him to help me. Titi came, and I was
holding the mare's head while he was putting the saddle
on her back when the Sergeant-major suddenly appeared.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" he asked Titi.</p>

<p>"Sergeant-major," I replied, "I could not manage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
saddle the beast, and as I have to ride her to-night, I
asked Titi to help me."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered the Sergeant-major, "you will
both have eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, and if I catch you
another time," he went on, addressing Titi, "it's eight
days' prison <i>you</i> will get." So saying he walked away
pompously, evidently well pleased with himself.</p>

<p>"Well, old chap," said Titi to me, "so you've got it at
last."</p>

<p>I felt very crestfallen, but I had no time to think much
about the matter, as I was already late and had to rush
to riding-school. The drill over, I hastened to De
Lanoy's room and asked him to intercede for me with the
Sergeant-major. He promised to do so at once, and I
anxiously awaited the result of his interview. At the end
of a few minutes I was called into the Sergeant-major's
room.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for you, Decle," said the latter; "de
Lanoy has spoken to me on your behalf, and if he had
done so sooner I might have overlooked the matter this
time, on account of the special circumstances, but your
punishment has already been put down on the report, so
the best thing you can do is to go through it with good
grace."</p>

<p>When I returned to my room all the other troopers
chaffed me unmercifully, but Titi was practical and sympathetic.
"Now look here, old man," said he, "let me
give you a few tips. First of all, as you've got warm
drawers I advise you to put on two or three pairs one
on the top of the other, and I also advise you to wear
two or three thick vests, because you know you'll have
to be searched before you go to the cells, and you are
not allowed to wear any regimentals under your canvas
trousers and blouse. You'll have to put on your clogs,
and all the covering you are allowed is your bread-bag"
(a canvas bag I have already described, and called a
bread-bag because it is generally used for fetching the
loaves of bread from the bakery. It afforded very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
covering, being only about four feet by two). At a
quarter to eight the trumpeters called "The men under
punishment," and I went down with Titi to the guard-room.
There were a dozen troopers punished with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle
de Police</i> that evening, and we were drawn up in front of
the guard-room. The Sergeant came out with a lantern,
and having called out our names he began to search us.
He felt us all over to see that we had neither matches,
tobacco, candles, nor spirits concealed under our clothes.
But he was a good fellow, and did not make as thorough
a search as I have seen made by some others.</p>

<p>One trooper only, who had his riding trousers under
his canvas ones, was ordered to pull them off, getting two
days more for wearing them. We were then marched off
to the cells. We first reached a huge door which the
Sergeant opened with an enormous key. This door led
into a passage, on the left of which were five heavily
bolted doors leading into the cells reserved to the men
punished with solitary confinement. At the end of the
corridor stood a solid door reminding one of the traditional
prison portal of the old melodrama; it was locked with two
gigantic iron bolts, each one closing with a key; when
these had been drawn, a key half a foot long and more
than an inch thick was inserted in the centre lock, in
which it turned with a grating noise. The door itself was
at least six inches thick and covered with heavy iron nails.
We had to stoop to pass through the doorway, and were
immediately greeted by a dreadful stench. The light of
the lantern being turned on our faces we could hardly see
where we were going, but when we had all marched in
the Sergeant gave a look round with his lantern and thus
enabled me to get a glance at the place. The room, a
kind of cellar, was about twenty feet square. On each
side of it ran a sloping wooden platform about seven feet
broad, its base standing a couple of feet above the cement
floor; at the top of the platform was a raised board about
two inches high and one foot broad, which was meant as a
pillow; this platform was our bed. The room was about
ten feet high, and at the extremity of it, near the ceiling,
was a small window, perhaps three square feet in area,
strongly and closely barred. The only furniture consisted
of an earthenware jug containing water and an iron cup.
In a corner of the room, in a small recess, stood a large
barrel about four feet high, with two steps leading to the
top of it, and with two iron handles on each side. This,
in regimental slang, is called "Jules," and is the only
sanitary (?) convenience at the disposal of the prisoners.
The whole place, having no means of ventilation, was
musty and slimy. We all stretched ourselves on the
platform, and the Sergeant, having seen us thus comfortably
settled for the night, retired.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i107.jpg" width="600" height="635" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE PLANK BED</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the key had been removed from the outer
door I heard the cracking of a match, and a candle was
lit by my friend Titi.</p>

<p>Having stuck the candle on the flat edge at the top of
the bed he at once jumped to the floor and addressed us.
"Look here, boys," he began, "I am the chairman of this
'ere meeting, as I hold the record for attendance in this
hall, where I have already presided over many a merry
gathering. As chairman, and as your senior, I must warn
you that my authority has to be recognised by every one of
you, and in my capacity of commander of the place, I may
as well remind you of the regulations. Remember that
'refusal to obey is a most heinous crime, the offender being
liable to be tried by court-martial.' As I notice that there
are a few uninitiated members here to-night, I will let them
know what are the rules and regulations of the place. I
will first proceed to the inspection."</p>

<p>So saying, he ordered us to stand in a single file in
the middle of the room; and all the troopers, scenting
fun, readily obeyed. He then commanded four of us, who
were making our first appearance in the place, to step
forward, allowing the others to sit down. "Troopers,"
he said, addressing us and mimicking the Colonel capitally,
"you have the honour of being admitted for the
first time to these ancient precincts, which have sheltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
many a great man, and it now becomes necessary
that you should pay due homage to our military
patron, the great and noble Jules. In order not to interrupt
the sanctity of your devotions, we shall leave you
in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with our noble patron, whom you will have
at the same time to guard. Trooper Decle," he concluded,
"right turn by the left, quick march!" Having
been warned beforehand of this traditional farce, I executed
the movement, and when I came within a step of
"Jules" was ordered to halt. "Now," said Titi, closing
the door upon me, here are your orders: "In case any one
knocks at the door you are to challenge the fellow and
inquire what he wants, and you must also see that Jules
does not run away." The door was then closed upon
me, and I was nearly stifled. At the end of a minute
or two came a knock. "Who goes there?" I said.
"Your commander," replied Titi from outside; "have
you followed my instructions, and has Jules inspired
you?" he went on. "Yes," I replied, "he told me that
the distinguished company would feel thirsty in the morning,
and he advised me to allay their thirst." "That's
right," answered Titi, opening the door; I then handed
over to him a five-franc piece to pay my footing. "Boys,"
he exclaimed, "'tis a hind wheel" (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une roue de derrière</i>&mdash;the
slang word for a silver dollar). "Three cheers for Decle."
The cheers were duly given. The three other recruits
were still standing in the middle of the room. "Now
what may your name be, you pug-nosed, carroty villain?"
demanded Titi, addressing one of the fellows standing up&mdash;a
recruit. "Dieudonné, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">présent</i>," shouted the boy, adding
to his name the answer given at a roll-call. Promptly
he was marched to Jules as I had been, and locked in, but
he was left there for ten minutes at least. When Titi
went to release him the lad only offered one franc. "It
won't do, my boy," said Titi. The fellow replied that this
was all he possessed; but on his promising to give fifty centimes
more in the morning, "to make up the price of a
quart of brandy," he was released. Then came the turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of the third recruit: he was a tall and magnificently built
fellow, 6 feet 1 inch high. "Now, you <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Colonne de la
Bastille</i>,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> what name has your father transmitted to his
pillar of a son?" "Look 'ere you," cried the recruit,
"don't imagine that I am going to let myself be bullied
like those two other idiots." "I say, Tommy," remarked
an old trooper of four years' standing, "don't be an ass;
we're having a bit of fun, and even the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> has
played the game like a man: we've all been through it;
if you don't go willing, you'll be made to go unwilling. Go
on, old chap." It was of no use; the man sulked and
would not budge. Thereupon Titi began another speech,
giving this time an imitation of one of our lieutenants.
"Ahem, I warned you, my friend, of the&mdash;as I might say&mdash;disastrous;
yes, disastrous consequences of disobedience;
you, er&mdash;understand well&mdash;disobedience&mdash;well, as I
said, I shall have you removed where you won't&mdash;or,
rather, where you decline to&mdash;go. Now, boys," he added,
turning towards the other men. Four of them had
already jumped up, and among them a certain Piatte, a
kind-hearted, clumsy-looking chap, but a most powerful
man. The first who approached the recruit were
knocked down, but Piatte, catching him by the legs from
behind, brought him to the floor. The three others at
once seized him by the arms and head, while Piatte held
his legs, and so carried he was roughly bundled into
Jules' corner, and the door locked upon him.</p>

<p>To make it the more secure the door was then tightly
held by four men, while the recruit inside kicked and
hammered at it in vain. "You cowards," he howled, with
curses; "you took me unawares, four to one, and from
behind too; wait until I get out! You don't know who I
am. I am <i>Jeannot the butcher, the Terror of Belleville</i>!"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Jeannot, and listen one minute," cried Piatte,
in his deep bass voice. "If you like I'll stand up to you;
fair fight, mind you; square fall, both shoulders touching.
Is that a go?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p>Jeannot ceased hammering upon the door. "All right,"
he shouted. "Now, you fellows, open the door!"</p>

<p>"Let go, boys," said Piatte.</p>

<p>Slowly the tall recruit stepped out; his face was flushed,
his eyes bloodshot. Folding his arms on his chest he
looked round. "Where's the idiot who dares challenge
me?" he said, surveying us with contempt.</p>

<p>"I am that 'ere idiot," said Piatte, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Jeannot looked at him and laughed. "So," he said,
"you want me to crush your bones? You fancy yourself
pretty strong, but presently you'll be sorry you spoke,
putty-face!"</p>

<p>"Very well, my boy, very well," quietly replied Piatte,
beginning to strip.</p>

<p>Jeannot followed his example, and as he had but a shirt
under his blouse, he was soon naked to the waist. He
was a magnificent specimen of humanity. His muscles
looked as if made of cast-iron; his chest was broad, his
body supple, and his wrists and hands were not coarse
like those usually found among the labouring classes.</p>

<p>Piatte took longer to strip, having a couple of flannel
shirts and three heavy vests to remove. When he was
bare to the waist, he appeared immensely powerful indeed,
but lacking the manly beauty of Jeannot. He was thick
set, with a short neck, breasts like a woman's, and a tendency
to stoop. His hands were enormous (he could not
get on No. 9 gloves). He was fully two inches shorter
than his opponent. Both men were, however, equally
matched in weight, each being about 14 stone, but at first
sight I felt sure that Jeannot would easily win the day.</p>

<p>"Who is to be umpire?" said Jeannot.</p>

<p>"Titi, of course," answered Piatte.</p>

<p>"Titi? Who is Titi?"</p>

<p>My chum came forward. "You don't know me, old
fellow," he began, "but you've often heard my name. I
was one year with old Blanc the wrestler. 'Titi de la
Villette,' don't you remember now?"</p>

<p>"What," cried Jeannot, "Titi de la Villette, the champion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
light-weight? Shake hands," and so saying he
extended his palm, which Titi firmly grasped.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Titi, addressing the adversaries,
"here are the conditions of the match: No grasping below
the waist or by the clothes; no foul tripping, and both
shoulders to touch the ground."</p>

<p>"Right you are&mdash;agreed," answered Piatte and Jeannot
simultaneously.</p>

<p>The two adversaries shook hands, and immediately
stood in an attitude of attack, with their knees bent, and
both arms half extended forward with open hands. Then
Titi gave the signal "Go!"</p>

<p>Jeannot thereupon advanced towards Piatte, who did
not shift his position. The assailant then laid one hand
on Piatte's shoulder, while he tried to get his left arm
round his adversary's waist, but every feint was baffled
by Piatte, who still remained on the defensive. Not a
whisper could be heard, but only the loud breathing of the
two wrestlers, and the sound of flesh striking flesh.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Jeannot sprang back, and immediately
rushing once more upon his adversary, caught hold of
him round the waist with his left arm, putting his right
arm over Piatte's left shoulder. Piatte stood the shock
without flinching, and with a rapid movement he brought
Jeannot's right arm down, allowing him to pass it under
his own arm so that Jeannot was grasping Piatte round
the body, while Piatte was encircling him over the
arms.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances Piatte would have been
at a disadvantage, but so powerful was his grasp that
Jeannot, though the taller man, could not bend to catch
his opponent round the waist, while Piatte fairly encircled
his man&mdash;over the arms, it is true, but under the elbows.
For a few seconds the two men held each other in a grip
of iron, but I noticed that, while Jeannot was panting,
Piatte did not seem out of breath. Then Piatte, with
a tremendous effort, lifted Jeannot slightly from the
ground; but, as he did so, Jeannot arched himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
regain his footing, and both men crashed heavily to the
floor: they both fell on the side without loosening their
grip, but Piatte quickly disengaged his left hand from
under his adversary's body, with the evident intention of
using his two hands to force his shoulders down. Taking
advantage of the movement, Jeannot, arching himself on
his head and feet, so that his two shoulders should not
touch the ground, succeeded in turning Piatte a little round,
and nearly managed to get on the top of him. Before
he could do so, however, Piatte had slipped one hand
on Jeannot's shoulder, and placed his other hand against
his waist, thus pushing him away. Jeannot was still
holding Piatte round the body, but the moment Piatte
slipped his hand on to his shoulder he let go, and, with
one hand on the ground, pushed himself away from Piatte,
and the next instant both men were kneeling alongside
each other. With a hand planted firmly on the ground,
each one tried in turn to grasp the other by the waist, but
in vain.</p>

<p>It was a fine sight to see these two powerful athletes
rooted to the ground in grim silence, broken only by
the impact of hands against muscular backs. At last
Jeannot managed to encircle Piatte's waist, but, before he
had succeeded in doing so, Piatte had caught him round
the neck; for a second they were entangled, but Jeannot
threw his legs up, and, turning a back somersault, slipped
his hand from Piatte's arm and fell on his feet, standing in
front of his adversary. Piatte had meanwhile remained
on his knees, and, with tremendous efforts, Jeannot tried
to move him, first by seizing him by the waist, then by
the shoulders. But Piatte remained immovable as a rock.
He told me afterwards that his chief object was to let
Jeannot exhaust himself while he was saving his own
wind.</p>

<p>This struggle lasted for a few minutes more, when
Jeannot suddenly slipped on the damp cement floor, and,
to save himself from being seized by Piatte, he flung
himself away, and rolled behind his adversary. In an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
instant both men were on their legs once more, Piatte as
cool as when he had first begun, Jeannot panting heavily.
For a short time they both stood feinting, when Piatte,
changing his tactics, made a rush at the Parisian giant,
and, before the latter knew where he was, he had been
lifted in the air and heavily thrown on his back with Piatte
on the top of him. In order to well assert his victory,
Piatte twice lifted Jeannot bodily, and made his two
shoulders touch the ground. Then the victor stood up,
greeted by our unanimous applause. Titi handed over to
him a flask of brandy he had managed to smuggle in, and,
after taking a long pull, Piatte wiped his mouth and,
turning round, said, "Now it's your turn, Jeannot." It
was only then that we noticed that Jeannot was lying
where he had been felled, and we all feared that he might
be seriously injured. Piatte hastened to his side, and was
about to lift him when Jeannot opened his eyes and
jumped up unaided. Turning towards Piatte, he extended
his hand to him. "Shake hands," he said; "you are the
first man who has ever felled Jeannot the butcher; but
you're a good 'un; you fight fair, and I like that; but
you fairly took the wind out of me that last go. Now,
boys," he went on, "to show you that I don't bear any
grudge, I'll pay my footing, and I'll be as generous as that
blasted millionaire of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>. Here goes 'a hind
wheel,' and good health to you all." So saying, he took
a long pull at the flask which Titi had handed over to
him. The combatants then wiped off the blood that ran
from a good many scratches on their bodies, and donned
their garments once more. In the excitement of the contest
the fourth recruit was forgotten, and, as he hailed
from Normandy (the Scotland of France), he kept cannily
in the background, and so avoided paying his footing.</p>

<p>Titi then suggested that we should have a song or two,
and it was fully midnight when, the candle having died
out, we all tried to go to sleep. The night was bitterly
cold, and as we had no blankets to cover ourselves with,
we all slept huddled together like sardines in a tin. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
been awake since 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, I was quite exhausted, and soon
dropped off to sleep, but only to wake up almost immediately
with a horrid sensation that something had run over my
face. I awoke my faithful Titi, who was sleeping beside
me.</p>

<p>"Got any matches?" I asked hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, why&mdash;want a smoke?" he replied, handing me
a match.</p>

<p>Just as I was going to sit up to strike the match something
else stirred my hair. When I had obtained a light
I looked round, and to my disgust I saw half a dozen huge
rats running about over my companions' bodies.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's the rats that worry you," said Titi; "you'll
soon get accustomed to them&mdash;the place swarms with those
fellows."</p>

<p>A nice prospect indeed! Every time I tried to go to
sleep I was aroused by a rat cantering over my face, so at
last I determined to sit up, gladly accepting Titi's offer of
tobacco and cigarette-papers.</p>

<p>"The Sergeant of the Guard to-night is a good sort,"
Titi told me, "and he won't say anything if he smells a
whiff of smoke."</p>

<p>At 2.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the Sergeant turned up, and when he
ordered us to get up and to clear out, I was already
rejoicing at the idea that I should be able to spend a few
hours in bed: but I was sorely disappointed when we were
taken to the pump and ordered to fill the two huge
tanks where the chargers had to be watered in the morning.
The night&mdash;it was early in December&mdash;was a bitterly
cold one, and the nipping wind pierced us to the bones in
the intervals between our turns at the pump.</p>

<p>It was nearly five o'clock before we had concluded our work:
I rushed to my bed, and when, a few minutes later,
the Corporal called out for the names of the sick men who
wanted to go to the medical visit, I put mine down, notwithstanding
Titi's warning that if the Surgeon-major did
not consider me ill, I should get an extra four days <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle
de Police</i> for malingering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>At 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, after <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réveille</i>, the Sergeant-major came to the
room and called me.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "you are not going to begin
these tricks with me&mdash;to report yourself sick just because
you have slept in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>."</p>

<p>I assured him that I was really ill.</p>

<p>"So much the better for you, if you really are," he
replied; "but mind you, I shall warn the Surgeon-major,
and if he finds that you are shamming there'll be another
eight days for you. And, by-the-by," he added, "I want
to warn you that troopers who are punished with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de
Police</i> are not allowed to use the canteen, and if I find that
you've set foot there&mdash;God help you! You will also,
during the two hours of rest you get every day, have to
do <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corvées</i> (hard work, such as cleaning the cells, carrying
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jules</i> about, and doing any unpleasant jobs that have to
be performed in the barracks)."</p>

<p>With this intimation he walked away.</p>

<p>Need I say that, now I knew all that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>
implied, it was not without dread that I looked forward
to the seven days I had still to undergo.</p>

<p>Although the description of my adventures has been
but just begun, enough has, perhaps, already been said to
indicate that the military training which might be made of
real educational value to French youngsters is but a
sordid and degrading experience, to be remembered with
loathing, or forgotten&mdash;if possible.</p>

<p>At 6.45 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> all the troopers who had had their names
put down on the sick list were taken to the infirmary by
the Corporal of the Week. We awaited the Surgeon-major's
arrival in a corridor; that morning there were
about fifty troopers on the sick list, and, to my great
relief, I learned that the Assistant Surgeon-major was
going to pay the medical visit. I had been specially recommended
to this officer, and when I had previously called
on him with my letter of introduction he had received me
most kindly, and promised that if I ever wanted his
services he would be glad to do anything he could for me.
As soon as he arrived we were called into the consulting-room
in batches, the troopers of each squadron going
in together. The consulting-room was small, the only
furniture consisting of a large table, on one side of which
sat the doctor, with the infirmary Corporal opposite to
him.</p>

<p>When the Corporals of the Week in each squadron
brought the sick troopers to the infirmary, they handed
over to the infirmary Corporal a book drawn up as on
p. <a href="#Page_101">101</a>.</p>

<p>As the troopers came to be examined by the Surgeon-major,
this book was placed by the infirmary Corporal
before the doctor, who filled in the figures&mdash;these signifying
the number of days during which each trooper was to
be exempt from the work stated at the head of each
column.</p>

<p>"Duty" means absolute exemption from all work, and
if the trooper so exempted was under punishment in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, he was excused from sleeping in the
cells.</p>

<p>"Boots" means that the trooper is excused from all
exercises necessitating the use of boots&mdash;viz., mounted
and dismounted drill, gymnastics, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltige</i>.</p>

<p>The two other columns need no explanation.</p>

<p>Whenever a trooper failed to be regarded as sick by
the Surgeon-major, he was invariably punished with four
days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> by the Captain commanding the
squadron. The Surgeon-major always refused to pass as
"sick" troopers who were dirty, and I have seen poor
fellows, with awful excoriations, sent back to their work
<i>because</i> they were <i>dirty</i>.</p>

<p>A copy of the above-mentioned book was taken by
the infirmary Corporal, who wrote down the surgeon's
diagnosis of each case.</p>

<p>That day the troopers of our squadron were called in
first, and, as I was the sixth or seventh on the list, I
watched the proceedings with keen interest.</p>

<p>The first trooper called up was suffering from a boil on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the thigh. "What's the matter with you?" said the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied the trooper, a stupid recruit, "I
have a sort of a red thing&mdash;you know, sir&mdash;just there,"
pointing to the place, "and it hurts me something awful
when I ride."</p>

<p>"Well, show it," said the doctor.</p>

<p>The fellow tried to pull up his canvas trousers, but
couldn't manage to get them up high enough.</p>

<p>"Why don't you take them off?" said the doctor impatiently.</p>

<p>The recruit hesitated, and the doctor, losing patience,
ordered the Corporal to undress him; the boy thereupon,
violently blushing, exposed his trouble. "Oh, a boil,"
said the doctor, handling him pretty roughly; and taking
a lancet from his instrument case, he made a deep incision
through the swelling. The recruit howled, but the doctor
told him to shut up, adding that he would be "exempt
from boots" for the next three days. "You will come
back in three days' time," he added, and he then ordered
the corporal to give him a dose of sulphate of soda.</p>

<p>On the table stood four very dirty tin mugs; two of them
contained a solution of sulphate of soda, and the others
ipecacuanha and another emetic, mixed with water. The
Corporal handed one of the tumblers to the trooper, and
as he was going out with it the doctor cried, "No, no, my
boy, you must drink it here." With a wry face the poor
recruit swallowed the ghastly mixture, and the Corporal
having ascertained that he had drained all the contents,
gave the tumbler to a trooper who stood beside a cupboard
containing medicines; without rinsing the tumbler, the
latter trooper, who was attached to the infirmary, filled it
up with another dose of sulphate of soda and replaced it on
the table. In the meantime the man next on the list had
been called. He was an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancien</i> trooper (<i>i.e.</i>, one of more
than one year's standing), and when asked what was the
matter with him, he showed the doctor a huge sore on his
heel, keeping the remainder of his foot inside his clog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
which he held with one hand. "Take off that clog," said
the Surgeon-major. The man hesitated to do so. "If
you don't take it off at once," roared the doctor, "I'll send
you back to your duty with four days' cells." The man
obeyed, and the sight which he then displayed was too
disgusting to be dwelt upon. Suffice it to say that his
toes were encased in a cake of filth.</p>

<p>"Just what I expected," remarked the surgeon, "and still
you're not ashamed of yourself," he went on, addressing
the man; "go and wash yourself. The next time a trooper
dares to come to me in such a state of filth I'll give him
eight days." When my turn came the doctor told me to
wait until the consultation was over, when he would see
me privately. After me came a trooper who complained
of pains in his back. "Oh, rheumatics," said the doctor;
"ipecac." The man had to swallow the contents of one of
the tumblers on the table, and rushed out very pale, in
anticipation of what he knew would soon happen. He
was exempted from drill on foot. Others were suffering
from sores of various kinds, chiefly due to riding without
being accustomed to it, and they were alternately ordered
a dose of sulphate of soda or of ipecac.; indeed, these two
medicines seemed to be considered a panacea in the French
army.</p>

<p>One man, none other than Piatte, the hero of the previous
night's contest, complained that he was not well,
but the doctor could not elicit from him any particulars of
his ailment.</p>

<p>"Have you any pain?" asked the doctor. "Yes, sir,
plenty of them," blandly replied Piatte.</p>

<p>"Where? In your stomach?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, just so, in my stomach."</p>

<p>"Show me your tongue."</p>

<p>After examining this the doctor told him that his
stomach could not be out of order, as his tongue was perfectly
clean.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Piatte, "my stomach hurts me in just
the same way that it does here," pointing to his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor felt the place he had pointed out, and Piatte
winced as though it caused him intense pain. "Have you
lifted any heavy load lately?" good-naturedly said the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," innocently replied Piatte; "and you don't
know, sir, what I've been suffering for these last four days.
I didn't like to come to the medical visit, because I thought
it would pass off; but really to-day, sir, it's more than I
can bear." The doctor fully believed him, and exempted
him from all duty for two days.</p>

<p>When Piatte walked out he winked at me. "Well, old
chap," he whispered, "ain't that grand? We'll have a
jolly good drunk to-day and to-morrow with yesterday's
oof." If only the doctor had seen him wrestling the
previous night, Piatte would not have fared so well.</p>

<p>The medical visit over, the Surgeon-major called me into
his private office. "So," he said, "you've fallen out with
your Sergeant-major. He sent me a note to warn me that
you have been punished with eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, and
he says that you are only shamming."</p>

<p>I told the doctor what had happened, and explained
that I was really feeling ill after the terrible night I had
gone through.</p>

<p>"I can quite believe you," replied the doctor, "but I
don't like to exempt you altogether from duty, as I do not
want to show too openly the interest I take in you. I
shall exempt you from 'boots' for a couple of days, however,
so that you will be excused from mounted and dismounted
drill, gymnastics, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltige</i>; in two days' time
return here, and I will then exempt you from duty for two
days, so that you will be able to have a good long rest in
bed. If I don't come to pass a medical visit on that day
I shall mention your case to my colleague, Surgeon-major
Lesage, and he will do what I ask him."</p>

<p>I returned to the room, and as I was free until 11 o'clock,
when I should have to go to the schoolroom, I hurried to
my bed in order to get a refreshing sleep. De Lanoy
soon turned up and asked me how I was. I told him I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
was dead beat, but he remarked that I had made a blunder
in going to the medical visit. "It has," he said, "absolutely
put the Sergeant-major's back up against you; he
said to me just now that you are nothing but a lazy brute
without twopennyworth of pluck." Although this rather
upset me, I felt so exhausted that I dropped asleep before
I could think the matter over. At 11 o'clock I turned up
in the schoolroom, and Sergeant Legros ordered me to
come and speak to him. "So, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</i> Decle," he sarcastically
remarked, "you've made the acquaintance of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boite</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> How do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Sergeant," I answered.</p>

<p>"And therefore," he went on, "you thought that you
would like a little rest to-day, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant," I said, "I assure you I'm really ill."</p>

<p>"Just so, just so," he went on. "But you'll soon get
used to it, as I am afraid that I shall have to send you
there <i>more often than your turn</i>." (Another regimental
expression in constant use in the French army.)</p>

<p>I returned to my table, and as the lesson we were told
to learn that day dealt with hippology (the care and
management of horses), a subject with which I was already
conversant, I had soon learnt the page we had been given
to study, and then joined my comrades in a game of baccarat,
which a sporting member of our set had suggested.
At first, as usual, we played for small stakes, but these
were soon increased, banks being sold by auction and
fetching as much as £10. In less than half an hour's
time one of my comrades had won over £30, while I was
a loser by nearly £12. These games of baccarat soon became
an institution, but I am glad to say that I never
"plunged," and never played beyond my means. One of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, who did not belong to our set, asked as a
favour to be permitted to join in our gambling, and having
been allowed to do so plunged recklessly. Payments
were made in I.O.U.s, redeemable at the end of each
month, but when the time came our plunger (whose losses
were a good deal over £100) explained that he could not
pay up just then as his allowance "hadn't yet arrived."
Apparently that allowance never arrived; at all events,
we never saw a penny of the money he owed us. As a
matter of fact, we soon found out that his parents only
allowed him £12 a month, a sum barely sufficient to
cover the cost of his board at the canteen and the pay of
the two troopers who fagged for him; so after paying certain
necessary tips, he was, of course, left with hardly any
pocket-money. While I am dealing with the money question,
I may say that £300 was the minimum required to
cover our necessary expenditure during our year's service
in the cavalry, and a good many of us spent much more
than that amount.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>Being exempt from "boots," I was excused from attending
gymnastics and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltige</i>, and was therefore free from
12 till half-past 2, but of course, being under punishment,
I could not go out of barracks. I proceeded therefore to
hunt up the orderly of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capitaine d'habillement</i>, as I had
heard from de Lanoy that his orderly had a room to himself,
above the stores, and that, until de Lanoy was
promoted to the rank of Sergeant, he used to arrange to
keep a tub and all his washing things in that room, paying
the man for the privilege 12<i>s.</i> a month. I found
the fellow, but to my utter disgust he informed me that
he had already arranged with three other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> for
the loan of his room (Walter being one of the lucky ones),
and he absolutely declined to have another <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>
using his apartment. "You see, old chap," he said to me,
"if a lot of you fellows come to my room, I shall soon be
found out, and not only shall I lose my billet as orderly to
the Captain, but I shall be sent back to ordinary duty in
the squadron, losing the comfortable little income I am
now making, and I am not going to run the risk." I
insisted earnestly, but without avail. I then inquired
whether any other orderly had a room to himself, but
found that he was the only one, and I was therefore
reduced to the pump for my ablutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>I explained just now that troopers who were punished
with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> were prohibited from using the canteen,
but I discovered that there existed, besides the two
cavalry canteens, an infantry canteen where Dragoons
could go; I therefore repaired there to have a meal, as I
had been quite unable to swallow for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i> the repulsive
mixture of bread and red beans cooked in stale fat,
with a few pieces of bone and sundry bits of tendons,
served in a greasy tin pot, which formed the fare of the
day. I found the canteen quite empty at this time of the
day, and the cooking was decent; there was, besides,
no chance of being discovered by any of the cavalry non-commissioned
officers, for they all messed in a room set
apart for them in each of the two cavalry canteens, while
this one stood at the top of a portion of the building
reserved for the line regiment. During the remainder of
the time I served I never failed to use this canteen whenever
I was punished, and the fact was never found out.</p>

<p>When I returned to my room, towards one o'clock,
intending to lie down, a Corporal came to me and
ordered me out for fatigue duty: I was to go and
sweep the cells with the other troopers. I pointed
out to the Corporal that I was sick and that I was
exempt from "boots," so that I meant to have a rest
while the other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltige</i>. "Yes, my
boy," replied the Corporal, "I'm quite aware of that.
But you're not exempt from clogs, and troopers exempt
from 'boots' are not excused from fatigue duty. So,
up you get, and come along." Reluctantly I followed.
The Corporal presented me with a very dirty broom
and accompanied by three other troopers I marched
wearily towards the cells. First of all, I was told off to
sweep the corridor, then the Sergeant of the Guard
opened the doors of three of the cells used for solitary confinement.
It was the first sight I had had of these cells,
and I hoped that it would never fall to my lot to be incarcerated
in one of them. Each was about twelve feet
by six. On one side stood a wooden bed raised a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of feet from the ground; and about seven feet long and
two and a half broad. A small shelf, a foot square,
suspended against the wall by two strings, was meant for
the prisoner's bread, so that the rats should not get at it.
In a corner was a small "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jules</i>," and alongside of it an
earthenware water-jug with an iron beaker on the top of
it; the only ventilation consisted of a small hole a foot
square and strongly barred, opening above the door, so
that when the latter was closed the prisoner found himself
in almost complete darkness. While we were cleaning
the cells the Sergeant of the Guard remained marching
up and down the corridor, as there was a prisoner in one
of them. His door was the last to be opened, and the
Sergeant of the Guard ordered him to step out in the passage,
while we were told off to clean his cell. The man
looked the picture of misery. He had already been confined
for five days, and during that time he had been able
neither to wash nor to shave, and the short allowance of
food had told heavily on him. Prisoners in cells are only
allowed the ordinary trooper's ration every other day;
during the intervening days they get one ration of soup
without meat, their other meal consisting of dry bread and
water. The prisoner asked the non-commissioned officer
to have his water-jug emptied and refilled, as there was a
drowned rat in it. I was told to hand over my broom to
another trooper, and ordered with another man to catch
hold of "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jules</i>" and to go and empty it&mdash;a task, as you
may imagine, I hardly relished. Fortunately for me, as
I was crossing the yard I met my friend de Lanoy, who
told me to put my odoriferous burden on the ground and
to follow him. He then went to the cells and ordered the
Corporal to send another man to relieve me, as he wanted
me for special work. He then ordered me to go and wait
for him outside his room while he remained behind. He
soon joined me and told me to go and have a good
wash and to return to his room. I went to the pump,
and after indulging in a good scrubbing returned to
de Lanoy's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a filthy life this is!" I exclaimed, when I entered
his quarters.</p>

<p>"Have you only just found that out?" he answered.
"I have been serving two years and a half, and although
I have been two years a non-commissioned officer, I am
thoroughly disgusted with it. I heard the Corporal
ordering you to follow him, and I might have told him to
select another trooper for fatigue duty, but, you see, I
have to be careful; if I showed you too much favour
I couldn't help you as I may be able to under more
serious circumstances. Now," he went on, "listen to my
advice. Whenever a Corporal orders you for fatigue duty
just call him aside and quietly tip him a couple of francs
to drink your health with, asking him at the same time to
allow you to find another man to do the work in your
stead. You will never fail to find a trooper glad to take
the job for a franc."</p>

<p>I followed his advice in the future, and it was only
when no other trooper was handy that I ever did fatigue
duty again.</p>

<p>That evening, at 7.45 I stood before the guard-room
among the troopers punished with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>. The
Sergeant of the Guard did not trouble to search us, but
immediately marched us off to the lock-up. We were but
six that evening; as usual, when the Sergeant had retired
Titi lit his candle. After singing a few songs all the fellows
dropped to sleep with the exception of Titi and myself.</p>

<p>"What a life!" said Titi to me. "I much prefer to be
in quod&mdash;some of them ain't bad at all."</p>

<p>"What! Have you been in gaol?" I asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Have I been to gaol! Heaps of times, old chappy!"
He was clearly not in the least ashamed to own it, but felt
quite proud, and enjoyed my astonishment.</p>

<p>"What did you do before you joined the regiment?" I
queried, in order to change the subject.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'faisais la muche</i>," he replied.</p>

<p>I did not understand what this meant, not being yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
versed in low slang; and I imagined that it meant that&mdash;like
many of the Parisians in our regiment&mdash;he had been
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vidangeur</i> (scavenger). I inquired what pay he used to
draw.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "it depended; my last <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marmite elle était
rien épatante, mon vieux, elle faisait ses cinq roues de derrière
tous les soirs</i>!"</p>

<p>He went on telling me a lot of stories on the subject,
which cannot, unfortunately, be reproduced here, but
which gave me a striking insight into the life of a French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maquereau</i> (a man who lives on unfortunates).</p>

<p>Seeing that he had absolutely no sense of shame, I
ventured to ask him about his convictions. He became
quite keen on the subject.</p>

<p>"Ah, my boy," he said, "don't think that it's only poor
beggars like me who're sent to quod: I have seen there
many a gentleman&mdash;yes, <i>gentleman</i>," he repeated, as I was
smiling&mdash;"gentlemen, like you, who drove in their own
cart; but that's neither here nor there. There's one thing
certain: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Y a pas d'justice en France, ma vieille!</i>" (There is
no justice in France, old chap.) "One day, for instance,"
he went on, "I had been with some friends to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre
de la Villette</i> (a small suburban theatre), and being a bit of
an artist myself&mdash;I have been a super at the Porte St.
Martin<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>&mdash;I became disgusted at the way one of the
fellows played Taillhade's part. Instead of walking like
a nobleman of the old times, and taking off his hat with
a great sweep of the arm and bowing like a prince, that
actor chap just walks in like if he had stepped into the
café at the corner, and he takes his hat off like if it had
been a billycock; I got that disgusted that I couldn't
help shouting: '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! malheur d'ons que tu sors?</i>' (Good
gracious, where do you hail from?) Chambardeau, the
grocer's assistant, then says to me: '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tais donc ta sale
gueule, Titi!</i>' (Shut up your ugly mug, Titi!) 'Ugly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
mug,' I says; 'what d'ye call that filthy beak of yours?'
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ton sal museau.</i>) 'All right,' howls Chambardeau, 'I'll
smash that phiz of yours<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> when we get out.' That was
too much for me, so I jumps at him; all the people shout,
'Turn them out!' The police comes and chucks us out,
and the other boys, guessing there'll be a row outside,
follers us. Well, we first kick up a row to get our money
returned; but it was no good, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergots</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> chucks us
into the street: Chambardeau and me we goes into a side
street to have it out. On the way Chambardeau pulls his
knife out of his pocket. 'Knives?' I ask. 'Yes, knives,'
he says. 'All right, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon salop</i>,'<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> I reply, 'I'll soon rip
open your tripe-bag.' Some of the boys had joined us,
and told us that the police were not likely to come, so
Chambardeau he says: 'Are you ready?' 'Yes,' I says,
and we close. Just then Mimi&mdash;she was the grocer's
daughter, and she was sweet on me, you know&mdash;'twas
that which made Chambardeau mad with me. Well,
Mimi turns up. They'd gone and told her, some of the
other chaps, and when she sees us going at it with knives
she hollers, 'Murder! Murder! Police!' The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergots</i>
come at a run, and just then Chambardeau he drops down.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergots</i> arrest me&mdash;the cowards! There was four of
them. They knock me down and kick me all over, then
they clasp the bracelets (handcuffs) on my wrists, while
the others pick up Chambardeau. 'What's the row?'
one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergots</i> asks of him. 'Row?' he says; 'there's
no row.' 'But,' says a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergot</i>, 'you are wounded.'
'Am I?' says Chambardeau. 'I suppose that I fell
on my open knife while I was playing with Titi.'
He was a d&mdash;&mdash; sneak, Chambardeau was, but he
never split on a pal. Well, they took us both to the
police station and locked us up&mdash;me, Chambardeau, and
Mimi. We had chucked our knives away, or else we
should have had another round. 'It's a pity,' says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Chambardeau, 'that the police came and spoiled the fun!'
'You bet, old chap,' I says. But then Mimi&mdash;she ought
not to have been with us, but the cells for the women
was full&mdash;she had been crying, and, as I was saying, she
takes Chambardeau's hand. 'It was real good of you,'
she says to him, 'not to have split on Titi.' 'I split on a
pal!' he exclaims. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mimi, j'en ai soupé d'toi.</i><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> 'Ah,' he
goes on, excited, 'I thought I'd make you love me; but
it's no use, you must think me d&mdash;&mdash; low to imagine that
I could split on a pal! Shake hands, Titi,' he then says,
'and keep her.' Just then his wound begins to hurt him.
It was nothing&mdash;I'd only stuck him through the arm&mdash;but
he was bleeding a lot, only he would not call out for a
doctor for fear it might tell against me. So Mimi tears
her apron and makes a bandage of it. The next morning
we were all brought before the Commissary of Police; and
although Chambardeau swore that it was all lies about
our having been fighting, and my having stabbed him,
they sent us both to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dépôt</i><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Panier à salade</i><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
(Black Maria). Two days later the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Juge d'instruction</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
examined me. He knew me, that man; I had been twice
before him already.</p>

<p>"'So here you are again, Martin!' he says.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' I answers.</p>

<p>"'Attempted murder this time,' he goes on, reading a
long report.</p>

<p>"'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah la bonne blague! C'est tout des menteries d'la
police.</i>' (Well, that's a good one! All lies from the
police.)</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"'But,' he answers, 'you were caught in the act of stabbing
the man Chambardeau.'</p>

<p>"'Now, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Juge</i>,' I said, 'ask Chambardeau
himself, ask Mimi Robinson, the grocer's daughter: they'll
both tell you if I am not speaking God's own truth.'</p>

<p>"'I have seen them both,' said the judge, 'and they
both accuse you.'"</p>

<p>"Now you see, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon vieux</i>," went on Titi, waxing excited,
and shaking me by the blouse, "you see I'd been
there before, and I knew that the judge was telling a
lie as big as himself. I had seen Chambardeau in the
passage at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dépôt</i>, and he had winked at me and
telegraphed&mdash;you know we had both been in quod before
and had learned there how to telegraph with our hands&mdash;so
he telegraphed: 'I have not been examined yet, and I'll
swear we were playing, and I hurt myself; I won't split.'
What's more, I had caught sight of Mimi in the witness
room, and she would not have been left there if she had
already been examined, so I knew it was all lies that the
judge was telling just to make me confess. I didn't lose
my head, but quite polite I replied:</p>

<p>"'I'm as innocent as an unborn baby, sir, and I only ask
you to confront<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> me with Chambardeau and Mimi.'</p>

<p>"'That will come in due time,' said the judge; 'you are
not going to teach me how to conduct my examination, are
you?'</p>

<p>"'May the Lord Almighty preserve me from such a
thought,' I replied, quite lamb-like, and to please him
I added, '&mdash;a kind, considerate, and just magistrate like
you, sir.'</p>

<p>"'That's enough, that's enough,' he says, but I could
see that he was pleased.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>"He then sent me back to gaol, and said he'd send for me
next day. I heard afterwards that Chambardeau was
examined after me: he swore on the head of his mother
that he had hurt himself by falling with the knife, which he
held open in his hand to peel an orange, and that while we
were skylarking he slipped on a bit of orange-peel. But
the judge told him that he could not possibly have inflicted
that wound of his on himself&mdash;and to prove it he read the
doctor's report. Chambardeau replied that he had always
been clumsy with knives, ever since he was two months
old; but he overdid it, you know. I've always told him so&mdash;he
overdid it when he showed the judge a scar on his
right arm, and said he had cut himself there while slicing
bread when he was two years of age. The judge, of course,
tried to make him believe that I had confessed, but Chambardeau,
whose temper was rather quick, replied that he
knew that was a d&mdash;&mdash;d lie, and so the judge sent him
back to gaol. Mimi was fine; she said she had seen
nothing of a fight, but that we were skylarking, and that
Chambardeau had slipped on some orange-peel and fell on
his knife.</p>

<p>"I was examined three times that week, and once the
next, and on the third week was 'confronted' with
Chambardeau and Mimi. We all stuck to our story, swore
that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergots</i> had told nothing but lies, and everything
was going on beautifully until the judge picks up our
knives that were lying on his table. One of them was
still covered with dried-up blood: it was mine; so the
judge says, 'Whose knife is that?' 'Hullo, they've
found my knife,' Chambardeau says natural like. 'You
are quite sure it belongs to you?' says the judge.</p>

<p>"'Sure!' answers Chambardeau; 'sure! a knife I've
had for more than a year: I remember the day I bought it
like if it was yesterday. It was a Monday, and it was
raining hard, and it was just to get out of the rain that I
went into the shop and bought it."</p>

<p>"'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Greffier</i>,'<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> says the judge to his clerk, 'you have
carefully taken down this deposition?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' answers the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">greffier</i>.</p>

<p>"'And this knife?' asks the judge, taking another one
from the table, 'is that yours?' I saw Chambardeau
wink at me, but did not understand, so thinking it was
Chambardeau's knife I said boldly, 'For sure it's my
knife, sir.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>"'Look at it carefully,' the judge says, handing it over
to me. I looked at it, and, without pretending to do so,
looked at the maker's name. 'Of course it is my knife,'
I again said, handing it back to the judge.</p>

<p>"'And where did you buy it?' he then asked.</p>

<p>"I thought that I had been jolly clever to look at the
maker's name and address, but I thought I'd keep that for
the last, so I said that I had bought it from a chap who
had bought it from another chap. 'But,' I added, 'to
show you that it's my knife and no mistake, I can tell you,
sir, that it comes from Lebrun, rue de l'Arbre Sec.'</p>

<p>"The judge smiled in a way I didn't like, and, calling his
clerk, he showed him the knife. 'Do you know that
knife?' he said. 'Of course, sir,' replied the clerk; 'it
is the knife you always keep on your desk!'</p>

<p>"The judge looked at me smiling, and did not say a
word, but his silence went bang through me.</p>

<p>"I had put my foot in it, right up to the knee, so I pretended
to gaze out of the window.</p>

<p>"'Chambardeau,' then said the judge, after a few
minutes of uncomfortable silence, 'and you, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fille</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Robinson,
you have both tried to obstruct the course of justice
and to defeat its aim, but truth cannot be hidden from it.'
He went on like that for ten minutes, old chap, and then
he said to Chambardeau that, as there was nothing against
him, he would be released, and then he went for me, calling
me a sanguinary ruffian, one of those men who are a
disgrace to society, and all sorts of tommy rot of the same
kind. He concluded his little speech by saying that I
would be sent for trial before the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tribunal Correctionnel</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
where he hoped I would be made an example of, and then
he dismissed us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Chambardeau and myself were taken back to gaol with
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tourniquet</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> on, held by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garde municipal</i>, and Mimi
had just time to tell me that she would see about getting
a good barrister to defend me. I told her to try and get
a fellow called Lehautier, who had already got me off
once: he could speak, that man, something grand. The
last time he defended me, he told the judges that if I was
before them it was because I was an orphan who had had
no mother to look after my youth&mdash;the old lady was at the
time doing five years under an <i>alias</i>!&mdash;and he talked them
round so well that he actually drew tears from them, and
I was acquitted.</p>

<p>"Chambardeau was released the following day, but it
was not till a month later that I was tried. My counsel
came to see me twice before the trial, and I did not like
his ways. Mimi could not manage to secure Lehautier,
who had become a great man, and wanted 300 francs
(£12) to take my case up, so she got that little chap for
50 francs (£2). If you had seen the side he put on!
'Don't tell me that you are guilty,' he began, 'because, if
you tell me so, my conscience'&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en va donc!</i> (get along)
his conscience!&mdash;well, his conscience would not allow him
to defend me. I told him, therefore, the story we had
concocted, but he said that would never do, and advised me
to say that it was true that I had stabbed Chambardeau,
but that he had begun the row, and that I only acted in
self-defence. And a jolly mess he made of it: he never
told Chambardeau nor Mimi anything about what they
had to swear; so they swore all wrong, and then the
judge presiding over the court put me all sorts of
questions about my previous convictions; and he then
called me a demoralised scoundrel and what not, and in
the end I got two months! And," added Titi, violently
shaking me by the blouse, "you call that justice! It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a fair fight, all fair and square, and I got two months for
it. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah malheur!</i> That's what they call a Republic. If
we had both been fine gentlemen, and fought a duel with
swords, and, instead of bleeding Chambardeau a bit, I
had stuck my sword right through his guts, every one
would have said what a fine fellow I was. Instead of
that, because I am only Martin, <i>alias</i> Titi de la Villette, I
get two months, and they call me a scoundrel. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah malheur!
malheur! malheur!</i> Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> That's
all right for those who've got money, but the poor people,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on s'en fiche!</i> (Who cares about them?)"</p>

<p>I am bound to admit that Titi was right on some
points; but, unfortunately, he did not realise to what
depths of degradation he had fallen.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest doubt that, taken as a whole,
the lowest classes in large towns, like Paris, Marseilles,
Lyons, and others, are far more degraded than the people
belonging to the same class of society in England, and
the French military service, instead of raising these men
to a higher plane, only brings down to their level those
who belong to the better classes, such as peasants, small
clerks, and so on. It is true that now men who have
been convicted before serving their time are, as I have
explained, sent to special battalions in Algeria; but still,
even to this day, the three years every able-bodied Frenchman
has to serve in the army are nothing but a period of
ceaseless degradation for men possessing any self-respect.
The system, one must acknowledge it, works better in
Germany; and the British army cannot, of course, be
compared to either these armies in which every citizen
has to serve; but I feel certain that had the troopers of
my regiment been placed under the command of British
officers, things would have been very different from what
they were. Most of the troopers who were constantly
punished would, with gentler treatment&mdash;and if the
Sergeants and officers, instead of bullying them, had appealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to their sense of honour, and to their better feelings&mdash;have
proved some of the smartest and most reliable
troopers in the whole regiment. Instead of that they
soon became discouraged, and ceased to care whether
they were punished or not. When my Sergeant, after
asking me how I liked the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, added: "You
will soon get accustomed to it," he condensed in those
words all the reasons which make a blindly rigid system
of discipline a complete failure.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>


<p>The day following my second night in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>
was a Saturday, and inspection-day. Our clothing was
to be inspected on this occasion. Each trooper had to
lay on his bed his various garments in such a way that
the regimental numbers should be clearly displayed. The
inspection took place at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, but as early as 12.30 our
respective corporals compared the list in our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">livret</i> with
the clothes on our beds, counting our tunics, trousers,
boots, underlinen, towels, and stable costume (canvas
trousers and blouse), in order to ascertain whether any
of our outfit was missing. All our underclothing had to
be previously washed, as well as our stable uniform, so
that troopers had to purchase secondhand canvas trousers
and blouses to wear while the others were drying.</p>

<p>In order to avoid punishment in case any of my kit
should be missing, I had, shortly after my arrival in the
regiment, a complete duplicate set of outfit made to order
by the regimental tailor, bootmaker, and armourer. The
clothes were made of exactly the same pattern and cloth
as those issued to us, but they were cut so that I could
wear them without discomfort. I had regulation boots
made in which I could walk with ease, and besides these
I had several pairs made in Paris by my own bootmaker;
in appearance these looked like regulation boots, but the
toes were narrower and the heels lower, with box spurs,
imitating the regulation spurs, screwed into the heels.
These I used for drill on foot and on horseback. I had
arranged to keep all my regulation outfit in a box which
I left in the orderly's room which I have already mentioned.
In this way I was always able to produce my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
regulation outfit in perfect order whenever a clothing
inspection was held. That morning I sent Titi to fetch
my clothes and regimental underlinen from their box, in
which was also stored all my duplicate kit, as we were
forbidden to keep on our shelves anything besides our
regulation outfit, or to have even a locker under our beds.
Under the previous Colonel troopers had been allowed to
have a box in which they could lock up their private
belongings, such as spare underclothing and letters, as well
as any money they might possess. To be deprived of this
convenience was hard on most of the troopers, as they had
to carry their money day and night on their persons. It
was even impossible to keep a book, as this was invariably
"bagged" while its owner was at drill or stables.
Petty thefts were of common occurrence, and it even
happened several times to me to have loose cash stolen
from under my bolster when I was asleep. To complain
of a theft would only have made the complainant pass
as a dirty sneak among his comrades, and would have
exposed every man of his squadron to suspicion.</p>

<p>To return to the inspection: The Corporal having seen
that each man's outfit was complete, the Sergeant came
to inspect the trooper's clothes to make sure that they
were in proper order, that no button was missing, and
that all spots of grease or dirt had been properly removed.
In case a trooper was short of some article of clothing,
this was duly reported by the Corporal, the Sergeant
making a note of it and reporting it in his turn to the
Lieutenant. If there was time enough before the arrival
of the officer, troopers who had sufficient money could go
and purchase at the canteen any small articles which
were needed to complete their kit (sponges and chamois
leathers were especially apt to be stolen from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>,
as it was impossible to identify such articles). At five
minutes to two we all had to be ready at the foot of our
beds; and the Sergeant-major passed through the room
to make sure that everything was in order, and every
trooper properly attired. A quarter of an hour later the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
cry of "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fixe!</i>" (Attention) was uttered by the trooper
standing nearest to the door. This announced the arrival
of an officer. The first to come was the Lieutenant of
our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>, a stout, middle-aged man, who spoke through
his nose. He carefully turned over the clothes on each
man's bed, distributing here and there a few days of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle
de Police</i>. When my turn came he looked at me.</p>

<p>"So that's you?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Impertinent as usual," he went on. "How dare you
answer me?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," I replied. "I thought you
had questioned me."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, don't think another time. I don't like troopers
who think. You've got no business to think. D'ye
hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What? Don't you understand me? I tell you not
to answer. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Warned by what he had just told me, I shut up.
Whereupon the Lieutenant, turning towards the Sergeant,
remarked, "Sulky brute, that fellow."</p>

<p>"Are all your things there?" he then asked me.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I think so."</p>

<p>"You think! You always think. I told you not to
think. You have no business to think. That's always
the result of too much education. These lazy dogs of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, they are always thinking. Troopers have no
business to think."</p>

<p>Continuing to mutter peevishly, the Lieutenant proceeded
to overhaul my things while I stolidly stood at
attention, at the foot of my bed.</p>

<p>"Look here, you&mdash;what's-your-name, what's the fellow's
name?" he grumbled to himself, looking at the placard
hanging at the head of my bed, on which my name and
regimental number was written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Decle," he read aloud, holding a pair of eyeglasses
in his hand&mdash;he seldom wore them on his nose.
"Lionel," he went on, reading to himself, "too d&mdash;&mdash;d
aristocratic to have a Christian name like anybody else.
Why is Lionel your Christian name?" he asked me;
"will you tell me why you call yourself Lionel?"<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>"Because my parents christened me so, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"A fine reason!" he said. "But it doesn't matter.
Don't you ever wear your clothes?" he added. "They
are all new; they've never been worn!"</p>

<p>"No, sir," I said. "I bought duplicates so as to save
those that were served out to me."</p>

<p>"Plenty of money to waste, eh? Regimentals not
good enough for you? I suppose you would consider
yourself degraded if you had to wear a regimental shirt?
Linen's too coarse for a tender skin like yours, eh?"</p>

<p>I thought it as well to make no reply. Lifting up my
blouse, the Lieutenant then looked at my shirt, and told
me to unbutton it. I was wearing under my flannel shirt
an under-vest made of wool and spun silk.</p>

<p>"Ah! just what I thought," again remarked the Lieutenant.
"The thing must wear flannel and silk like a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cocotte</i> (a fast woman), and then calls itself a trooper. <i>I</i>
don't wear any undervests, and yet I'm an officer! Well,"
he added, as he passed on to the next bed, "you've
already found out that silk vests won't prevent you from
going to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>. You've got nothing missing
to-day, but I'll soon catch you napping. You won't pass
many inspections without having to send you to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boite</i>.
Silk vests indeed!" he kept on muttering.</p>

<p>He then began to examine Titi's bed. After looking
through his outfit he lifted up the mattress, and found
underneath it a dirty pair of drawers and a newspaper.
"Just as I expected," he remarked. "What's that?" he
asked, showing the newspaper to Titi.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's an old newspaper, sir," blandly replied Titi,
"that I put aside. I bought some things in the town and
they were wrapped up in it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>The Lieutenant looked at the date of the paper; it was
the previous day's number of a Radical journal.</p>

<p>"So, we read the paper here; the vilest rag, too, that
was ever printed. Well, you will see what it will cost
you, you dirty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Communard</i>. To begin with, you'll have
eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, and I shall specially report
you." So saying, the Lieutenant, holding the paper by
the tips of his fingers, at arm's length, as if it had been
something likely to contaminate him, handed it over to
the Sergeant, de Lanoy, ordering him to go and throw
that "vermin" on the dung-heap. "De Lanoy," he
added, "on your way stop at the Sergeant-major's
office and tell him to put you down for two days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle
de Police</i> for the disgusting state in which your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>
is kept."</p>

<p>As the Lieutenant was looking over the last trooper's
outfit our Captain came into the room. The Lieutenant
went and spoke to him, and they both returned towards
Titi's bed.</p>

<p>"So, Martin," said the Captain in a great rage, "you
dare to read papers in the barracks,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and as you are now
undergoing eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> you cannot possibly
have brought it in yourself. I want to know from whom
you got it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't get it from anybody, sir," replied Titi. "I
found it in the courtyard of the infantry barracks."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me lies," said the Captain sternly, "or
you'll be sorry for it. Tell me who gave you that
paper."</p>

<p>"Nobody, sir."</p>

<p>"If you tell me," said the Captain, "I won't increase
the punishment Lieutenant Pernod has given you. If you
don't, I'll give you eight days' prison."</p>

<p>"I found it, sir," insisted Titi.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>"Very well," said the Captain, "get your things ready
to go to prison."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," politely replied Titi.</p>

<p>"And if you go on much longer like that," said the
Captain, in a voice shaking with rage, "you'll soon go to
Biribi."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The Captain walked out, accompanied by the Lieutenant,
and soon afterwards two men from the guard, accompanied
by a Corporal, came into the room with drawn
swords, and Titi was marched away between them to the
prison.</p>

<p>On inspection-days we did squadron duty after
"Stables," having neither drill nor school, and those
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> who were not undergoing punishment were at
liberty to go out of barracks until 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The troopers
who had twenty-four hours' leave were allowed to quit
the barracks after evening stables and remain away until
the next Monday at 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> After stables the regimental
orders for the day were, as usual, read out to us, as well
as the punishments. Those were numerous, and included
two days' confinement to the room, for a Lieutenant, for
being out in civilian clothes the previous afternoon; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle
de Police</i> for three Sergeants as a result of the inspection,
while about twenty men were punished similarly, getting
from two to eight days, their outfit having been found
short, or their clothes soiled. Among the troopers
punished with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> were three <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, and,
finally, came Titi's name, with a sentence of eight days'
prison by the Captain "for having introduced a newspaper
into barracks, and having obstinately refused to
give the name of the trooper from whom he had obtained
it."</p>

<p>That evening, I was, as usual, taken to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de
Police</i>, where I was much astonished to find Titi lying on
a straw mattress rolled up in a blanket. He called out to
me as soon as the non-commissioned officer had locked us
in, "Come here, old chap," he said; "I'll make some room
for you, old Decle, and we'll share my mattress and
blanket."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<p>Although a scoundrel, Titi was at the bottom of his
heart a kind fellow, and I felt most grateful to him for
sharing his rough bedding with me, especially when a little
later on he produced his inevitable candle, and I saw that
in order to let me lie down comfortably he was lying himself
on the bare boards, his back only resting against the
mattress.</p>

<p>I inquired from him how it was that he was undergoing
his prison in the same lock-up as the one used for men
punished with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, and I expressed astonishment
at his being privileged to enjoy a mattress and a blanket.
He explained to me that the only difference between prison
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> was that the men punished with the
former, instead of doing duty in the daytime remained in
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> day and night. They had, however, to
do two hours' punishment drill in the morning and again
in the evening, and during the remainder of the day they
were employed on fatigue duty, having to carry water about,
to make ditches and earthworks, and to do all the dirtiest
work. On the other hand, they were allowed a straw mattress
and one blanket, and were not called upon to work
at the pump in the middle of the night. On the whole,
it struck me that prison was a far milder punishment than
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, and I found this undoubtedly to be the case
when later on I became personally acquainted with the
former punishment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>


<p>According to the doctor's orders I went to the medical
visit in the morning. Being a Sunday, there were but a
few men who had reported themselves, but besides myself
there were two <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, one of them being the poor
fellow of whom I spoke when I described our first riding-lesson
under Sergeant Legros; the inside of his knee had
been so badly scraped that further riding had caused
extensive inflammation, and he was ordered to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Infirmerie</i>
(a kind of hospital ward in the barracks, where sick
soldiers who want special attention, but are not ill enough
to go to hospital, are kept). As before, the doctor kept
me waiting until he had disposed of the other cases, and
then exempted me from duty for two days. I was thus
excused from all work, and, what I still more appreciated,
had not to sleep in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>.</p>

<p>The doctor also inquired very kindly how we were treated
by our Sergeant. I frankly told him the truth. "I am
not astonished," he said; "I know the man and I pity
you." He then went on to tell me how different had been
the treatment of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> under the previous Colonel;
my friend, de Lanoy, was then in charge of them, and
none of the bullying we were subject to ever occurred, or
would have been tolerated then. The doctor further
allowed me to make use of the dispensary if I cared to
read or write while off duty, and, as will be seen, I owe an
immense debt of gratitude to him, as well as to the other
Surgeon-major of my regiment, Dr. Lesage, who was
Surgeon-captain, Dr. Chatelain holding only the rank of
Lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoon I availed myself of the permission
which had been granted me of using the dispensary, and I
was sitting there sketching when Surgeon-major Lesage
stepped into the room. He was a brisk and restless little
man, very stern in appearance, but with the kindest of
hearts.</p>

<p>"What the deuce are you doing there?" he asked, as I
rose to salute him and stood at attention. I explained
matters to him. "Yes," he said, "I know; Dr. Chatelain
has spoken to me about you, but you're a bit of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pricotteur</i>,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind," he said in his brusque way.
"When you are ill, I'll look after you, but don't come to
me when you aren't&mdash;I don't like it."</p>

<p>He hurried out of the room, and went to visit the
troopers in the sick ward.</p>

<p>When I resumed work on the Tuesday it had been snowing
hard during the night, and the cold was such that our
fingers soon became benumbed through contact with our
carbines. I have omitted to mention that in the cavalry
white doeskin gloves are always worn at drill; and we
were even allowed during the winter months to wear white
woollen gloves. In the infantry the men drill without
gloves, and only wear them on parade, or when they go
out of barracks, their gloves being of white cotton.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Before drilling us Sergeant Legros carefully examined
our carbines, and gave <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l'&oelig;il</i>" to three
of us. As I have already explained, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l'&oelig;il</i> means that
the punishment is not reported to the officers, and therefore
is not recorded. In my time this led to monstrous
abuse, as neither the Captains nor the Colonel were
aware of the number of men who were daily punished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>It was so cold that we felt quite delighted when we
were commanded to start at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas gymnastique</i> (a quick run),
the Sergeant and the Corporal running with us for a
couple of hundred yards, when they fell out. We soon,
however, began to feel exhausted, but Legros noticing
this called out to us: "You d&mdash;&mdash; lazy brutes, keep your
distances, or I'll leave you on the run for half an hour
longer." First one, then another, fell out, utterly unable
to go on, each one of them being told that he would sleep
in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> that night; then came my turn, with
the same result, but little did I care for the punishment, as
I had to sleep in the den in any case. Altogether six of
us were punished after we had been kept on the run for
more than a quarter of an hour!</p>

<p>We were kept drilling on foot for half an hour longer,
and during that time our Sergeant took a delight in
making us "Shoulder arms," "Slope arms," "Present
arms," and leaving us in the same position for three or
four minutes at a time, while if a single one of us wavered
in the least he never failed to make us repeat the movement.
Day after day the same thing occurred, until the
two hours of foot drill became a daily terror to us.</p>

<p>Sergeant Legros took also special pleasure in the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltige</i>. The few of us who, like myself, had soon learnt
to run alongside the horse while cantering in a circle and
to jump on his back facing the head or the tail, or to jump
on the horse and then to alight by passing the leg over
the neck jumping up once more astride the animal, were
seldom called. The Sergeant's delight was to get a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> who could just manage to jump on the cantering
horse, and then to order another clumsy chap to jump
behind him: if the man succeeded in doing so without
bringing the first rider to the ground, the Sergeant
whipped the horse until both riders fell off, and in that
case he usually gave each of them one or two days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle
de Police</i>.</p>

<p>Another trick he was particularly fond of making us
perform was "the scissors." This was usually done on
the circus saddle, although some of us could do it on the
bareback horse with only a surcingle. It may be thus
described:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i149.jpg" width="600" height="496" alt="" />
<div class="caption">EXERCISE IN RIDING SCHOOL (VAULTING)</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Being on the horse you seize the iron handles fixed on
each side in front of the saddle, then putting your weight
on your wrists you throw your legs high up in the air,
bending forward as much as you can; you then cross
your legs, and letting the handles go you drop back into
the saddle facing the horse's tail. To face once more the
horse's head you repeat the movement, laying hold of two
leather loops fixed at the back of the saddle, but you
must be careful to bend your head downwards towards the
outside of the circle described by the horse, or else
instead of falling on the saddle you are violently jerked to
the ground. A fairly good rider can soon learn to perform
this trick bareback, throwing himself back with the aid of
the handles fixed on to the surcingle, while to face once
more the horse's head he pushes himself well forward
towards the withers, and placing his hand on the animal's
back he vaults with the weight of his body thrown well
towards the inside of the circle.</p>

<p>Had we had a different Sergeant who, instead of having
but one object in view&mdash;to punish us&mdash;had put us on our
mettle and developed a spirit of emulation, we would have
soon proved the pick of the regiment. One or two of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were splendid athletes, two of us at least
being able to jump over the whole length of a horse leap-frog
fashion, leaping from behind and landing in front of
the animal's head. Most of us could in the same way
jump standing on to the horse's back, my friend Delbruck
being among the best athletes of our lot. It is true that
his mother was English and that he had received an
English education.</p>

<p>That evening it was freezing so hard that we were
allowed to take our great-coats to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, and
the Sergeant of the Guard being a friend of de Lanoy's I
was excused from pumping water, and sent to my bed at
3 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The following day I was still more lucky, for
de Lanoy having taken the guard, allowed me to sleep in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the stables instead of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>. I made myself
snug alongside my mare, and the dear little beast cannot
have moved for hours, for I slept beside her from 8.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
till 3 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> I was awakened by a great commotion: one
of the chargers had kicked in such a way as to get astride
the partition of his stall, where he got stuck. I arose to
help the stable guard, and with the handle of a broom we
managed after a good deal of trouble to unhook the partition,
which fell to the ground, releasing the unfortunate
horse.</p>

<p>I then returned to my own charger's stall, and passed a
most comfortable night. I had once more to sleep in the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, but, fortunately, that was my last day
of it for the time being.</p>

<p>The frost was getting more intense every day, and it
has, indeed, been recorded that the winter of 1879 was
one of the severest within the memory of man. The cold at
last was such that orders were given by various Captains
that we should drill in the stables instead of out of doors;
this at least saved us from having to run round a yard
until we were completely exhausted.</p>

<p>As we began to know Sergeant Legros better we were
able to realise into what hands we had fallen: some days
he was in a good humour and none of us would be
punished; at other times he would only put in an
appearance when we were assembled for drill on foot;
but when he failed to appear at morning school, which in
his absence was presided over by a Corporal, we were
certain that it was a bad sign. The moment he appeared
he looked sulky, with a heavy cloud over his face, and
his first words to us usually were, "I am going to stick
four of you in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> to-night, so you had
better look out." This promise he never failed to keep,
and four of us invariably slept in the lock-up.</p>

<p>We were already in the middle of December, and
Christmas was fast approaching, so that we all looked
forward to the few days' leave we hoped to get at that
festive season; but, alas, I little suspected what was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to befall me. The Colonel seemed to have taken an
increased dislike to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>. First came a regimental
order by which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were strictly forbidden to
mess at the canteen. As, however, he could not stretch regulations
far enough to prevent us from using the canteen, he
worded the order thus: "In future," he said, "the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> will have to go and fetch their rations from the
kitchen like other troopers; Corporals are enjoined to
report any <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> failing to obey this order." This
was all very well, but he could not compel us to eat if we
were not hungry. Still, the result of this order was great
inconvenience to us, as it meant our being detained in the
room until our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamelle</i> had been brought by the orderly.</p>

<p>On the Sunday before Christmas I was expecting a
party of friends who had promised to come and look me
up, and had asked me to dinner. At afternoon "Stables"
I therefore went to the officer of the week, and asked
him for ten o'clock leave, as I said some members of
my family were coming to see me. Immediately after
"Stables," donning one of the uniforms I had had specially
made of better cloth, I went to the station to await my
friends' arrival. They were artists, and were accompanied
by two music-hall stars of the day. I waited for them
on the platform, and when they alighted from their
compartment, one of the ladies complained that an old
gentleman, whom she pointed out to me, had been rubbing
his foot against hers in so persistent and insulting a
manner that she was compelled to request him to desist.
I had a good stare at the old man, and made some uncomplimentary
remark to the lady about him. We then
proceeded to take our seats in a four-in-hand brake I had
hired for the occasion, and drove off merrily to the forest,
a few miles from the town. I was driving, and on the
way I observed that we passed in one of the streets the
old gentleman of the train. We spent a most pleasant
afternoon, and were enjoying our dinner when my friend
de Lanoy sent word that he wanted to speak to me. I
asked him to join us, but he declined to do so, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
insisted upon the waiter telling me that it was most
important that I should come out to him at once. Accordingly
I went, and, at de Lanoy's request, we adjourned to
my room.</p>

<p>"What the deuce have you been doing, old chap?" he
began; "Major Vian has just been to the barracks, fuming
with rage, and ordered me to mount my horse and look
for you all over the town, and when I had found you, I
was to bring you back with me, and stick you straight
off in prison."</p>

<p>I simply could not understand what it meant, and told
him exactly how the case stood: that some friends, whose
names I mentioned, as he knew them also, had come to
spend the afternoon with me, and that before dinner we
had driven in a brake to the forest. I asked de Lanoy
whether by so doing I had in any way infringed the
regulations; but he told me that he did not see anything
irregular in my proceedings. He then inquired whether
I had met the Major on the way and failed to salute him;
but I was able to assure him that I was quite certain
that I had duly saluted every officer I came across.
"Well," he said, "I cannot understand it; but I will tell you
what I will do for you: I will tell the Major that I couldn't
find you; so go on with your dinner, and, as you have
ten o'clock leave, enjoy yourself till then; but you must
expect to be locked up the moment you return to barracks."
De Lanoy then expressed his regret at being unable to
join us, explaining that being on duty he could not
possibly do so. This occurrence naturally marred the
gaiety of the following proceedings, but my friends tried
to cheer me up, and affected to treat the adventure as a
joke. At ten o'clock I returned to barracks and reported
myself to the Sergeant of the Guard. The Sergeant, a
friend of mine, told me that "I had put my foot in it,"
and that he had strict orders to march me to the cells
then and there. At the same time, with some curiosity,
he asked me what I had been doing. I was as ignorant
as he was of my supposed crime, and could supply him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with no information. I handed my sword over to one of
the troopers of the guard, and asked him to take it to my
room with my helmet. I was then marched off to the cells.
Between ten o'clock and midnight five more troopers were
brought into the prison, all of them in full uniform, and
in a disgusting state of drunkenness; of course they
kicked up an awful row, and there was no sleep for me, as
may well be imagined. At half-past twelve we heard a
tremendous disturbance outside the cell door, and the
moment it was opened a trooper, mad with drink,
struggling, kicking, and swearing, was chucked inside.
As soon as the door had been closed upon him he rushed
to it, and for fully a quarter of an hour went on hammering
and kicking at it like a maniac; realising then that
his efforts were all in vain, he tottered towards the camp
bed and threw himself bodily on two or three men who
were lying on it. He was received with curses, and
violently thrown off, dropping with a tremendous thud on
to the pavement of the cell. He arose, however, madder
than ever, and, with oaths and curses, declared that he
was going to rip open the whole b&mdash;&mdash; lot of us.</p>

<p>Unfortunately at that moment one of the troopers
struck a match and lit a candle. This only added to
the fellow's drunken fury, and to our horror we saw him
pull a huge clasp-knife from one of his pockets. We all
sprang to our feet, but the drunken man, selecting a
trooper against whom he evidently had a grudge, made a
rush for him; at the same time the candle was upset, and
in the dark we could hear the two men struggling and
rushing about the cell. "Who has got a match?" I
shouted. As ill luck would have it, nobody could find
one for the moment, so, unwilling to be ripped open in
the dark, I groped my way towards a recess where
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jules</i>" stood, and closed the door behind me. A few
minutes, perhaps but a few seconds, later I heard Piatte's
deep bass voice saying, "No you don't, my children, no
you don't!" I carefully peeped out, slightly opening the
door. The candle had been re-lighted, and in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of the cells stood Piatte, in uniform, holding two men,
one by his coat-collar, and the other by the wrist. It
appears that Piatte had returned to barracks drunk that
night, and had been taken to the lock-up, but, being in
a very quiet mood when "boozed," he had merely gone
to lie down in a corner. He had been aroused by the
noise of the fight, and had immediately jumped up to
separate the belligerents. It was dark when he first
tackled them, and in the struggle he had been stabbed
through the arm. In the meantime some one had found a
match and re-lighted the candle just as I emerged from
my place of safety. It was superb to see the Hercules
Piatte holding these two men, absolutely frenzied as
they were, as easily as if they had been mere babies.
"Put down your knives, you beggars," he said to them,
and as the man who had begun the row, and whose
wrist he held, swore that he would do no such thing,
but that he would soon have his knife through Piatte's
digestive organs, the latter gave a wrench to his wrist
which made the weapon drop to the ground. Some of
us had in the meantime disarmed the other fellow, and
Piatte then addressed them:</p>

<p>"Are you going to be quiet and go to sleep, you silly
beggars?"</p>

<p>A torrent of abuse was the only reply, and the two
combatants continued to swear they would have one
another's blood.</p>

<p>"Very well!" said Piatte. "If you are so anxious to
knock each other about here goes!" and so saying, he
banged the two men one against the other half a dozen
times as if they had been mere puppets. He then let
them go. "Got enough of it, my boys?" he asked
grimly.</p>

<p>They had apparently had quite enough of it, for they
both went to lie down moaning heavily. Curiously
enough, neither of them had been stabbed, and they had
only received some insignificant scratches. Beckoning
to Piatte to come to me, I examined his wound; luckily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for him he was wearing his uniform coat, and the thickness
of the cloth had partly stopped the knife, and it had
only penetrated slightly into the flesh of his arm. It was
with difficulty that I induced him to let me bind it up with
my pocket handkerchief, a trifling service which the kind-hearted
fellow never forgot, and which he repaid in more
ways than one. When the Sergeant of the Guard came at
3 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to take the men to the pump, I was ordered to stop
in the cells, the Sergeant having received special instructions
to keep me there until the Major turned up in the
morning. There were two prisoners to keep me company,
but dog-tired as I was, I soon dropped off to sleep, and
did not awake till half-past six, when my friend de Lanoy
came to look me up. He had tried to find out what I was
charged with, but had failed to do so; he promised, however,
to come and let me know as soon as he obtained any
information, so that I should be prepared to face the
Major, before whom I was to be brought at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> De
Lanoy also kindly suggested sending me my washing
materials and a razor, in order that I should not look the
disgraceful object I then did. Shortly afterwards the
Corporal of the Guard brought me my things, as well as a
bucket and a looking-glass, and while I was making my
toilet he chattered with me about my case.</p>

<p>"You're in a nice hole, old boy," he said, "and I
shouldn't like to stand in your shoes. What on earth
have you been doing?"</p>

<p>I assured him that this was the very thing I did not
know myself.</p>

<p>"Now that is all rot," he replied. "It must have been
something, jolly serious, too, for when the Major came to
the barracks yesterday he was in a greater rage than I have
ever seen him in before. Yes," he went on, "I really
thought he would have had a fit."</p>

<p>I once more renewed my assurance that I was absolutely
unconscious of having done anything wrong.</p>

<p>"Get along with you," said the Corporal; "you won't
get me to believe that, but if you choose to keep it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
yourself, do so, by all means, I don't care." He then took
my things away, and I was soon left to my own thoughts,
the two prisoners being taken out to do work. At
9 o'clock de Lanoy returned, and told me that so far all
he knew was that I had been given four days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de
Police</i> by the Lieutenant who had given me ten o'clock
leave the previous day. At 10.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the door of the cells
once more opened, and the Corporal of the Guard ordered
me to step out, whereupon I was marched off between two
of the troopers of the guard, who, with drawn swords,
escorted me as far as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Rapport</i>. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>
soon came to the door and ordered me to walk in, stepping
out himself at the same time, and closing the door
behind him. The room was a spacious one, with a large
table in the middle of it, at which a small bald-headed
man sat signing documents; his back was turned to me
whilst I stood near the door at attention. After a few
minutes' silence, only interrupted by the grating of his
pen upon the paper, the little man, without turning round,
called out:</p>

<p>"Trooper Decle, come here."</p>

<p>I advanced, turned round to face him, and, as I saluted,
what was my horror at discovering that the enterprising
old gentleman whose foot had annoyed one of my lady
friends in the train on the previous day, and about whom
I had passed some rather uncivil remarks, was ... my
Major!! The reason I had not recognised him as an
officer was that since I had joined the regiment he had
been away on leave, and he had only just returned. I
stood at "Attention," my heart beating fast, but the old
gentleman (his age was perhaps fifty-six or fifty-seven)
did not speak a word, but stared at me from head to foot
with a look that seemed to pierce me.</p>

<p>"So," he said, after a few minutes' time, "we are one of
these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, one of these dashing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, who,
although they wear a Dragoon uniform, are nothing after
all but dirty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits crêvés</i>. We invite painted females,
who are nothing but low <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocottes</i>, to come and visit us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and we parade them about the streets in a four-horse
brake when our officers are content to walk on foot!
Trooper Decle," he proceeded in a stern voice, "you are
a disgrace to the 50th Dragoons. You have disgraced
your uniform by a contact with such creatures, you have
disgraced yourself by passing uncalled-for remarks on
your betters, and although you are a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> you are a
liar, and nothing but a b&mdash;&mdash; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maquereau</i>."</p>

<p>I turned pale under the insult, but as I had determined
to keep my temper, I made no reply. This seemed
to excite the gradually rising fury of the Major, who had
now risen from his chair and was pacing up and down
the room livid with rage.</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer?" he cried; "what have you
got to say, dirty swine that you are! I suppose you
belong to the class of youngsters who are proud to be
seen in the company of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocottes</i>, and afterwards leave
those ladies to settle the bill for them."</p>

<p>This I confess was too much for me, but still determined
to outwardly restrain my temper, I took two steps
towards the Major, and crossing my arms on my chest,
looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>"I have let you insult me, sir," I said slowly, "in
order to see how far you would go. The ladies of whom
you have just spoken are, I know, far above your contempt,
and it strikes me that if they had cared to accept your
senile advances, you would probably have thought them
most divine creatures. I need not defend them, they are
too well known to require such defence," I continued,
mentioning their names.</p>

<p>"As for myself," I went on, "you have accused me
of playing the basest part a man can play in this world.
It was not through respect for the gold stripes you wear
on your sleeve that I kept silent, but through respect for
your white hairs. In a few months' time I shall no longer
be a Dragoon, and I hope that in a few years I shall be
somebody, while you will be&mdash;yourself: nothing else but
one of the mass of retired Majors whose intelligence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
means will limit them to a glass of absinthe, and a game
of dominoes before dinner, and the company of a local
bailiff, or the constable of their native village. You called
me a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maquereau</i> just now, and you seem to be so well
acquainted with the habits of that class, that I can only
conclude that you gained that knowledge personally at a
time when nature made you more attractive than you are
now."</p>

<p>The Major, who had been too dumbfounded to answer
a word so far, turned pale when I uttered those words,
and, seizing his riding-whip, which lay on the table, lifted
it as though about to strike me, shouting at the same
time, in a voice choked with rage, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Misérable!</i>" I
wrenched the whip from his hands, and replacing it on
the table stood once more at "Attention."</p>

<p>"I will court-martial you," went on the Major; "you
shall have ten years for this!"</p>

<p>"I may or may not, sir," I replied; "but supposing I
am court-martialled, I shall bring witnesses to expose the
way in which you behaved in the train yesterday, and
you may regret the step you have taken. As to our
present conversation there is only your word against
mine, but I suppose that being only a trooper my word
will stand for nothing; still, as I told you before, think
well over the matter before you do anything rash."</p>

<p>The Major said nothing, but went on feverishly pacing
up and down the room, he at last stopped, and sat down
at the table.</p>

<p>"Decle," he said, "Lieutenant Riel has given your four
days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> for having told him a lie in asking
for ten o'clock leave on the pretence that you were going
to meet your family, and your punishment will be increased
to fifteen days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> for having been
seen driving a four-in-hand through the town in fancy
uniform. Now, go!"</p>

<p>I did not wait to ask for any further explanation, being
only too glad to escape as I had. I must add that the
Major was evidently persuaded that he had put himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the wrong, for I was never afterwards punished by him,
and in no case did he increase any punishment given to
me. The whole thing was pretty rough on me, however,
as those fifteen days meant my spending Christmas and
New Year in the cells while all my comrades were enjoying
a well-deserved leave. After the eight days' cells I had
previously had, those fifteen days given to me within the
first two months of my service branded me as a bad
character, and I fully realised that in future punishments
would be showered upon me.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>


<p>It will be readily understood that the end of that year
was one of the most unpleasant times I ever went through.
The cold was bitter, and we were pretty nearly frozen in
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>. Just before Christmas all my comrades
went home with eight days' leave, and I was the
only <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> left behind. There was one comfort, however,
in the fact that, Sergeant Legros being also on leave,
I escaped his daily bullying. By that time I had also
learned how to avoid all fatigue duty, having found out
that there was not a single one of our Corporals who was
not open to a bribe; in fact, some of them knowing that I
was pretty free with my money, openly came to me, saying,
"I say, Decle, I am thirsty to-day; are you going to
stand a bottle, or do you want to do fatigue duty?" Of
course I immediately forked out a franc, and was thereupon
left alone. I had also made friends with a good
many of the Sergeants, and when any of those with whom
I was friendly took the guard they invariably allowed me
to sleep in the stables instead of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>. The
cold was so bitter just before Christmas that the Colonel
issued an order allowing the troopers punished with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle
de Police</i> to wear their second-best regimental trousers
under their canvas ones, and to use their great-coats when
sleeping in the cells.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day more than fifteen troopers were
thrown into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> during the night, all of
them having returned to barracks in a state which an
English policeman would describe as "drunk and disorderly";
prominent among them were Titi and Piatte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
both most gloriously drunk, but having just enough sense
left to remember that their chum Decle was in durance
vile. The moment they got in they called out for me, and
on my answering them, they threatened every one with
blue murder if a candle was not produced at once, as
they wanted to see their dear Decle. I had smuggled
in a candle as well as some matches, and thinking that
it might keep them quiet, I lit it. The moment they
saw me they rushed to me with demonstrations of affection
with which I could well have dispensed, Piatte
especially insisting on repeatedly embracing me, and,
unconscious of his great strength, hugging me as tightly
as a bear, until I feared he would crack my ribs. The
boon companions then produced a miscellaneous collection
of articles from their pockets&mdash;greasy papers containing
sausages and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boudin</i> (a kind of sausage made of pig's
blood with a lavish addition of garlic); mixed up with
these were bits of cheese, cakes, and, last but not least, a
pint of brandy.</p>

<p>"We brought you that, old chap," said Piatte, "because
we didn't want an old chum to spend a miserable Christmas."</p>

<p>It must be remarked that Piatte was a Protestant from
Lorraine, where Christmas is, I believe, religiously kept
as the greatest festival of the year, while in other parts of
France New Year's Day is considered far more important.
To please the poor fellows, whose kind-heartedness I fully
appreciated, I partook sparingly of their victuals, although
they were far from appetising. I pretended, too, to drink
some of the vile brandy, but a sip of it was quite enough.
The two men then sat down near me.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Piatte, "we've had a grand time of it, a
grand time, my boy!"</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Titi, who was a little muddled; "if
you had seen that little infantryman flying out of the
window you would have simply roared."</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt, Titi," screamed out Piatte, trying at
the same time to give Titi a friendly buffet with his open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
palm; unfortunately, however, I sat between the two, and
the badly aimed blow fell on my head and nearly knocked
the senses out of me; seeing this, Piatte, to comfort me,
hugged me once more in his powerful arms.</p>

<p>"Well," he resumed, "we started at three o'clock this
afternoon, just after stables, and as we got outside Titi
says to me, 'Got any oof, Piatte?' 'Oof,' I says, 'open
your eyes well and look at that.' I had received, two
days ago, a remittance from the old woman, my old
granny&mdash;ten francs, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon salop</i>. So Titi looks at it, and
he says, 'Ah, ten francs; oh my, I'll show you something
better than that,' and he pulls out of his pocket a 'gold
un'&mdash;a whole twenty-franc piece. 'That's from my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>;
he's a rare un,' he says.</p>

<p>"That's you, you know," added Piatte, digging me in
the ribs.</p>

<p>"That's God's truth," hiccoughed Titi.</p>

<p>"Shut your head, Titi&mdash;you're drunk. Isn't he drunk,
that fellow? But, as I was telling you," Piatte went on,
"we took the road past the railway, and came to that
little pub 'The Three Jolly Comrades,' where there's a
sign-board where they've painted a Dragoon, a Piou-piou,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and a Gunner walking arm-in-arm&mdash;you know the place,
don't you?"</p>

<p>I didn't, but assured Piatte that I knew it well.</p>

<p>"'Let's go in,' says Titi: but I says, 'No.' Fancy
going into a place where they put a Dragoon arm-in-arm
with a Piou-piou! But Titi, he says, 'Oh, never mind
their bally sign-board if their wine's good,' and I says,
'There's sense in that,' so in we goes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<p>"There was a billiard-table in the place, so I says to
Titi, 'After we have had a drink we will have a game,
Titi.' We called for a drink, and a jolly nice girl comes
to serve us. You should have seen her, old chap; she
was a regular ripper&mdash;plenty of flesh and some to spare.
I had taken her hand, and was telling her what a fine girl
she was when half a dozen Piou-pious walked in the
place. The girl tries to take her hand away and blushes,
and I see one of the Piou-pious stare at me like mad.
Well, I didn't say nothing, but I let go the girl's hand,
and she brings us our wine and a flask of brandy; we
finish our bottle, and just as we were drinking our last
glass I see one of the Piou-pious take off his coat, and
they all take billiard cues and calls out for balls; so I get
up and I say, 'No, look here; 'tis our game and not
yours.' One of them says, 'First come, first served.' I
says, 'Just so; we came first, and first we play.' But
the Piou-pious wouldn't give in, and the one that had
stared at me, he calls the landlord. When the old man
comes I say, civil like, 'Now, look here, landlord: I have
come into your house, although I didn't like that 'ere board
on the outside. How dare you call that "The Three
Jolly Comrades," and put up a picture of a Dragoon
walking arm-in-arm with a dirty mean bug of Piou-piou,
like if any Dragoon would lower himself in that way!'</p>

<p>"'Dirty mean bug!' shout all the Piou-pious together.
'You filthy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">citrouille</i>!' (A nickname given to Dragoons,
meaning "pumpkin.")</p>

<p>"This was too much for me, so I turns to Titi and I
says, 'Did you hear that?'</p>

<p>"'Didn't I!' he says. 'What shall we do&mdash;chuck all
these dirty shrimps out of the window, eh?'</p>

<p>"'That's it,' I say, and I goes to open the window. I
must tell you Titi and I had taken off our swords and put
them in a corner when we came in. I had just opened
the window when one of them takes his billiard cue by the
tip and hits me with the thick part of it; but it just struck
on my helmet, and you can see it hit hard. Look,"
added Piatte, picking up his helmet, which was quite
bashed in. "Oh, then," he went on, "my blood was up and
I went for that chap, and without more ceremony I take
him by his coat-tails and his collar, and I send him, cue
and all, right over the billiard-table, where he falls all of
a heap and stops there. At the same time the four others
had set on Titi, so I rushed to his help; he was down, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
they were hammering at him like mad; so I hit one here,
I hit another there, I gave the third a dig in the chest with
my head, I sent the fourth against the billiard-table with
a kick, and Titi gets on his legs. The others, except the
one I had chucked over the billiard-table, had also got up,
and we were fighting like mad when three other devils
who were passing along the road stepped in and joined in
the row. 'Oh,' I says, 'is that so? Helmets, then!'
Titi understands me; we take our helmets off, and swinging
them by the end of the horse-tail, we strike right in
among them promiscuous like. My boy, if you had seen
them: they drops one after the other; only three of them
remained standing up, and while Titi was having it out in
the corner with one of the chaps I stood facing the two
others. One of them, the coward, draws his sword-bayonet,
but with a swing of my helmet I knocks it out of
his hand, and as the window stood open I chucked him
out of it. The other one, in the meantime, had caught
hold of me from behind, but I soon shook him off, and
lifting him from the ground&mdash;he was a miserable little cur&mdash;I
shook him like a rat. I bang him against the wall, and at
last he cries, 'Oh don't, don't.' 'Going to beg pardon?'
I asked. 'Oh yes,' he says, 'I beg pardon.' 'Very well,
then,' I says, sticking him on the ground standing with
his back to me, 'if you move God help you!' at the same
time I holler, 'Prepare to receive cavalry!' and didn't he
receive cavalry, just! With one kick in the back I sent
him flying to join the others."</p>

<p>At the recollection of this Piatte burst into such a roar of
laughter that it awoke Titi, who had fallen asleep on my
shoulder, and he, too, began to guffaw idiotically.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Titi," yelled Piatte once more. "Where was
I? Oh, I know," he went on. "Titi had by this time
knocked his man down, and without asking for our bill, we
pick up our swords and bolt like mad. As we get out, the
chap I had chucked out of the window has just regained
his feet, and he hollers 'Murder! Murder!' He was a
corporal, and 'twas a bad case. The landlord had been hollering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
'Murder!' the whole time; but, d'ye see, the
place stands all by itself, and only the three chaps I spoke
of heard him. We hadn't gone a hundred yards before we
see all the Piou-pious rush out of the pub and make for us
like mad. We hadn't been such fools as to cut towards
the town, so when we saw them after us we made off across
country, and, as luck would have it, they didn't chivy us
far. But we'd given them too good a dressing to be up to
much. All the same, we ran for another mile, and then we
sat down and had a good laugh. Then Titi, he says, 'It's
all very fine, but I don't like it; that ere d&mdash;&mdash;d Corporal'll
be bad for our health: we must rig up an alleyby.' So to
rig up his blooming alleyby, he says, 'Let's go down to the
river, and first of all let's have a swill!'&mdash;we were pretty
bloody and dirty, you bet&mdash;'and then we'll go to a bloke
I know who's got a boat, and then we'll get back to the
town, and make out as how we've come from the North
Road, and we've been in the forest, and you got your
helmet smashed bird's-nesting.' And so we did. By a
roundabout way we got to the river and had a wash; we
soon found Titi's bloke, and he took us over in his boat.
'Give us a hind-wheel,' says Titi, and he hands it over to
the boat chap. 'Mind you,' says Titi, 'you've seen no
Dragoons to-day.' 'Mum's the word,' he says back, and he
pulls off and throws a line into the water quite innocent like.
We ran towards the forest until we hit the road, and then
we walked quietly down towards the town. On the way
we meets Lieutenant Granford riding; he stops and says,
'What's the matter with your helmet?' 'Oh, sir,' I says,
'I tried to get a rook's nest, and nearly broke my neck.'
'Well,' says the Lieutenant&mdash;he's a good sort, you know&mdash;'you'll
have to pay for it; but bird's-nesting is a better
occupation than getting drunk.' 'Yes, sir,' says Titi, 'we
don't mean to liquor any more!' 'I'm glad to hear it,'
says the Lieutenant, and he canters off.</p>

<p>"'There's our alleyby,' says Titi, 'all cut and dried, and
now for a bally good booze!' Ah! my boy, what a day
we had of it! But unluckily we forgot the time. We'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
only got ten o'clock leave, and as we were looking for
another pub, to blow off our remaining four francs, we
found one where the shutters were just being put up. 'By
Jove!' says Titi, and asking the chap who was putting up
the shutters what sort of time it was, we heard ''twas a
quarter to twelve!' Off we cut to barracks, but on the
way, just as we were getting round the corner, Titi didn't
feel well, and he says, 'Hold hard a minute, old chap!'
That's just what done it. Titi never can stand a drop of
lush, and he began to be that sick, and made such a bally
row, that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>, who was sneaking about the shop,
he pounces on us, and wants our names. So long as we
were walking it was all right; but the moment we had to
stand at 'Attention' things began to swim a bit. I see
Titi isn't steady, so I catch hold of him to prop him up;
but he clutches me, and we both sprawl on the ground.
Well, that finished it. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> calls out to the sentry
to send two men from the guard-room, and he orders them
to march us up to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>&mdash;and here we are.
But we had a jolly good drunk," concluded Piatte, with
a satisfied air; and extinguishing the candle we went to
sleep.</p>

<p>The next day the two revellers had fifteen days' prison
by the Colonel's orders. A complaint was lodged by the
Colonel of the infantry regiment that an assault had been
committed by Dragoons on one of his Corporals, and it
appeared that two of the privates had also been seriously
injured in the fray, and were lying in hospital. Fortunately
for Piatte and Titi the injured Corporal and his
comrades had reported that they were set upon by at least
half a dozen Dragoons. The case was a serious one, however,
and I feared that Piatte and Titi would be found out;
this would mean a court-martial, and very likely they would
be sentenced to death, a sentence invariably carried out in
all cases when an inferior has been striking a superior. The
following day the Corporal and two of the soldiers who
had taken part in the fight were taken through our barracks.
We were all mustered by squadrons in stable-dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the prisoners among the others; the Corporal and
the two infantry soldiers were marched along our ranks,
and the Corporal soon pointed out a trooper as one of the
offenders, while the two privates also declared that they
recognised him. It fortunately turned out that the man
was on guard duty the previous day; and on discovering
this our Captain of the Week, who was in charge of the
parade, immediately ordered the infantry soldiers to be
taken back to their barracks, and to be sent straight off to
prison; he also drew up a strong report against them, which
was at once handed over to our Colonel, who demanded an
exemplary punishment for the men from the Colonel commanding
the infantry regiment. Doubtless these men
merely made a mistake, for troopers look so different in
stable-dress and in full uniform, that it is almost impossible
to recognise them, unless you know them personally.
Nevertheless, it was a narrow escape for Piatte and Titi.
Our Captain gladly availed himself of the men's mistake
to prevent further investigation, as the rivalry which
exists between troopers and infantry soldiers extends to
the officers, and in cases such as the one I have just
described officers will generally try and screen their men.
It is, indeed, very seldom that infantry officers are seen
with cavalry officers, who generally look down upon the
former with utter contempt.</p>

<p>Between Christmas and New Year we had hardly any
drill, a large number of the troopers being away on leave,
so that with the exception of stables we had scarcely any
work, and I was able to rest in the daytime. At night
I had, of course, to sleep in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>; it was
daily more loathsome a trial, as since the frost had set in
the rats which infested the place were constantly coming
to lie against us for the sake of heat. I devised an
arrangement which proved most useful. I got a bag
made of very thin india-rubber sheeting; it was about
six feet long with a drawing-string at the top of it, so that
when I had pulled it on I could fasten it round my neck,
and it kept me as warm as if I had several blankets over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
me. When it was folded up I could wind it round my
waist, where it looked like an ordinary belt. I also had
the benefit of the mattresses Piatte and Titi were allowed
as prisoners, and I soon got accustomed to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de
Police</i> without suffering severely from it. There is no
doubt, however, that it is a cruel and barbarous punishment,
especially in the cavalry, as neither blankets nor
straw mattresses are allowed to the troopers. In the
infantry, soldiers punished with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> are allowed
a straw mattress and a blanket, and have, moreover, no
pumping to do in the middle of the night. It is scandalous,
too, that troopers once in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> should
be isolated in such a way that in case of sickness or
emergency they cannot possibly summon help. Many fatal
cases have been the result of this practice. Some years
ago a trooper was found in the morning frozen to death
in the cells, and yet more serious tragedies have occurred.
Since I served there was the case of a Zouave who was
put in solitary confinement and forgotten there, his body
being only found a week later; so great had been his
pangs of hunger that it was found that he had been
trying to eat the flesh of his arms and his hands, and
when he was discovered the rats had themselves eaten a
portion of his back and of his throat. I also remember
another case of a man who was sent to the punishment
battalions in Algeria; he was punished with two days in
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">silos</i> and was forgotten there, and when he was discovered
six days later he was still breathing, but the
whole of his chest, on which he had been lying, was
but a vast ulcer swarming with maggots. "How?" it
will be asked, "can such a thing occur?" It may be explained
in a few words.</p>

<p>Every morning before the guard is changed a list of all
the men who are punished is drawn up by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant's</i>
clerk. In the columns standing opposite their names is
written down the class of punishment which they are
undergoing, with the number of days they have still to
do, thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>As will be seen, the numbers in the various columns
reserved for each punishment indicate how many more
days of that class of punishment the soldier has to
undergo, and this list is stuck on a board which is hung
up in the room of the Sergeant of the Guard, a fresh list
being made up every day. Supposing that by some
mistake the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant's</i> clerk should, in making up his
fresh list, put the figure belonging to Trooper
Duval's name in the C.B. column instead of the cells, the
Sergeant of the Guard would naturally conclude that there
were no men in cells, and since in the case of certain
barracks the cells are a few hundred yards away from the
guard-room, the unfortunate fellow would be left in them
without food, and might be unable to make himself heard.
This was actually the case in the instance of the Zouave
I have just mentioned. This arrangement turned out,
however, to my benefit. One day, as I was complaining
to de Lanoy of the hardship of having still ten days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle
de Police</i> before me, he suggested my making friends with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant's</i> clerk, who would gradually leave out a few
days in the punishment list; for instance, when I had
still eleven days to do, he would mark nine days on
his list, and at the end of a couple of days more, instead
of marking seven days against my name he would put
down five, and the following day mark me as having only
three days more, so that in this way I should contrive to
sleep in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> for <i>seven</i> nights instead of
twelve. De Lanoy added that this could never be found
out, as the Sergeants of the Guard were daily replaced,
and none of them saw anything but the fresh list. I
immediately followed his advice, and found that a young
fellow with whom I had become great friends had previously
acted as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant's</i> clerk, and was on very good
terms with the present occupant of the post. Both were
fond of drawing, and as I did a little in that way myself,
my friend suggested that he should take me to the clerk's
office to show me his drawings. We adjourned there at
once, and in the course of conversation my friend suggested
to the clerk that he might as well strike off a few
days from the remainder of my punishment. The latter
readily agreed, and explained that it was especially easy
to do so the following morning, as on that day the Week
would be taken by the second <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>. He then asked
me how many days I had still to do, and I told him that
twelve days remained. "Oh, that will be all right," he
said. "I'll put you down for seven, so that in case the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>, who is just quitting duty to-morrow morning,
should, when he takes back 'the week,' look through the
list, he would again see your name on it. But it is
very unlikely that he will see the list. He never calls
for it."</p>

<p>This plan was duly carried out, with complete success,
though unfortunately it did not prevent my sleeping in the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> on New Year's Day.</p>

<p>I had purposely avoided going to the medical visit, as
we had but little work in the daytime, and I did not like to
pester the doctor or to take advantage of his kindness. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
had cause to regret, however, not having done so on New
Year's Day, as I spent a terrible night on that occasion.
More than twenty-five troopers were thrown into the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, and the disgraceful scenes I have previously
described were renewed. Quarrels, fights, and fiendish
uproar lasted throughout the night, so that I was unable
to close my eyes. I was not, however, ejected from my
resting-place, as I was lying between Piatte and Titi, who
soon disposed of any man who tried to encroach on our
domain. I fully expected that on the occasion of New
Year's Day the Colonel would, in accordance with precedent,
cancel all punishments. There was one man in
solitary confinement, three in prison (viz., Piatte, Titi, and
another trooper who had been absent without leave for
five days), and about ten other troopers punished with
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, ranging from three to five days. On New
Year's Eve the Colonel proclaimed in the Regimental
Orders that all punishments would be cancelled, except in
the case of troopers who were undergoing a punishment
of more than eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>. This, of course,
was aimed at me, for the Colonel was fully aware that I
was the only trooper who had lately been punished with
fifteen days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boite</i>. As, however, I was free in the daytime,
although I could not go out of barracks, I got a good
dinner prepared at the infantry canteen, where I used to
go and take my meals <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sub rosâ</i>. I also managed to bribe
the Corporal of the Guard, and sent through him half a
bottle of brandy, a bottle of wine, and a large meat pie to
my two chums Titi and Piatte in prison. I need not say
that my attention was greatly appreciated, and the two
fellows heartily thanked me when I joined them in the
evening.</p>

<p>On January 3 we resumed our work, under Sergeant
Legros, who returned from his leave sulkier and more
malicious than ever. Four of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were sent to
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> that night, and the Sergeant threatened
me with the same punishment because I was hoarse and
was unable to command when ordered to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>I had now been sleeping for many nights in the lock-up,
and although I did not realise it at the time, the
cold and dampness of the place had told heavily on me.
I was so weak that I could hardly sit my horse, and I
grew worse daily. On the Saturday (inspection-day) we
did our usual squadron duty, and after stables, as I was
leading my charger to the watering-tanks, I felt hardly
able to sit on her back. She was as usual prancing and
plunging, and once or twice I had to cling to her mane so
as not to drop off. As we were returning from the tanks
towards the stables, the Lieutenant of the Week, who was
also the Lieutenant of my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>, shouted to me:</p>

<p>"Jump off your charger, and give it to another man."</p>

<p>I jumped off, and staggered towards the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"You're drunk, you dirty pig!" he screamed. "You
shall have eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> for drunkenness."
Then turning towards the Sergeant, he went on, "Sergeant,
can't you see that man is drunk? Get him taken
to the cells at once. Why couldn't you have seen before
that he was drunk?"</p>

<p>"I'll teach you, you blackguard!" he added, turning to
me.</p>

<p>I said: "Sir, I am not drunk, I am ill."</p>

<p>"And you dare reply!" he again howled; "you are
always answering back! We will see what that will cost
you. Sergeant," he said to de Lanoy, "you will put down
eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> to this drunken swine for having
come to stables helplessly intoxicated, and having made
impertinent remarks to an officer."</p>

<p>I at once realised that if such a report reached the
Colonel my punishment would be altered to at least fifteen
days' prison, and seven days' cells, in solitary confinement,
on bread-and-water, and that it would further mean
a disgrace for me from which I should never recover.
Fortunately, at that very moment, I caught sight in the
distance of our regimental doctor, and without asking
leave I ran to him for all I was worth.</p>

<p>"Sir," I said, "Lieutenant Pernot has just accused me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of being drunk, and I implore you to examine me, as I am
not drunk, but seriously ill."</p>

<p>The doctor told me to follow him to the dispensary,
and as I was doing so Sergeant de Lanoy came hurrying
along.</p>

<p>"Decle," he said, "Lieutenant Pernot has sent me to
bring you back to him at once, and he threatens to have
you court-martialled for having refused to obey his orders
when you were told to go to the cells."</p>

<p>The Surgeon-major, who had caught the message, turned
round to de Lanoy, "Go and tell Lieutenant Pernot," he
said, "that Decle is coming to the dispensary with me by
my orders, and there is an end of it."</p>

<p>De Lanoy returned to the Lieutenant, but before we had
reached the staircase leading to the dispensary he returned
once more, saying that the Lieutenant insisted on
my going back to him, whether the Surgeon-major liked
it or not.</p>

<p>The latter, whose temper was shortish, asked in a voice
shaking with rage whether de Lanoy was quite sure that
he had exactly repeated the Lieutenant's words.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied de Lanoy.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Surgeon-major, "tell Lieutenant
Pernot that I, Surgeon-major Lesage, holding the rank of
Captain, order Lieutenant Pernot to come to me at once."</p>

<p>As de Lanoy hesitated, the Surgeon-major angrily
added, "Do you hear me or not? You had better tell
your Lieutenant to hurry up."</p>

<p>We did not wait long, for Lieutenant Pernot soon
arrived, and had evidently been hurrying, as he was
nearly breathless.</p>

<p>"What the deuce do you mean," said the surgeon, "by
countermanding my orders?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied the Lieutenant, pointing to me, "that
man is drunk."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," answered the surgeon,
"and I am the best judge of that. I should strongly
advise you not to interfere with my orders another time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon he turned on his heel, and telling me to
follow him, hurried up to the dispensary. There he laid
me on a sofa, and asked me what was the matter. I told
him that I had undergone fifteen days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>,
and felt perfectly worn out. He felt my pulse and took
my temperature, which was very high.</p>

<p>"You are pretty bad, my boy," he said, "and I am
going to send you to hospital."</p>

<p>I thanked him warmly, and told him how grateful I felt,
pointing out that had it not been for him I might have
been disgraced for ever in the regiment.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I don't like the way they are treating
you, and&mdash;I will tell you what&mdash;whenever you are bullied
come to me, and I will excuse you from work. I respect
you because you went through your last punishment without
ever coming to the medical visit, and, in future, if you
don't feel well, you have only got to come here and tell
me what you don't feel fit for, and I will inform the
Colonel." He added, "Troopers used to be punished only
when they deserved it, but now the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> seems
to have become a regular institution, and I don't like it&mdash;that
is all I can say." He concluded by telling me that
the dispensary Corporal would make out my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Billet de
l'Hôpital</i>, and that he himself would come and see how I
was that same evening.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>


<p>It must not be imagined that a trooper can be sent to
hospital without having to go through innumerable formalities,
the French administrative system being so
devised as to complicate the simplest matter. Before
going to hospital, a full inventory of all the trooper's
belongings has to be drawn up by the Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i>,
the trooper being allowed to retain only the undress uniform
which he wears. The remainder of his kit, including
his arms, are returned to the stores, where a fresh inventory
is made, his saddle alone remaining in the squadron
saddle-room. It would be tedious to describe the innumerable
documents which have to be drawn up on the
occasion. All these formalities having been at length
completed, I was marched to the hospital by a Corporal,
and, on arriving there, fresh ceremonials had to be
gone through, after which I was handed over to the
tender mercies of a Sister of Charity. She took me to
the ward reserved for soldiers, the hospital being a mixed
one, where civilians also were received. Our ward contained
about twenty-four beds, and was spotlessly clean.
The beds were excellent, and certainly far superior to
those usually found in English hospitals. I then received
my hospital kit, consisting of a huge night-shirt, a pair of
dark blue flannel trousers, with a dressing-gown of the
same material, a pair of woollen socks, slippers, and a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnet de coton</i>, a most extraordinary head-gear made of
thick knitted cotton, finishing up in a point with a tassel
sewn on to it. (Most of the French peasants still sleep in
a similar night-cap, and, until thirty years ago, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Frenchman, even if belonging to the higher classes, used
to wear this strange head-gear at night.) I was put to bed;
my temperature was taken, and then I was left to my own
thoughts. In the next bed to mine a poor fellow lay with
typhoid fever, while in the bed on the other side lay an
infantry soldier suffering from jaundice. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnel</i> of
the hospital, or at least of the military wards, consisted of
three Sisters of Mercy, with an old male nurse belonging
to the Hospital Service Corps. The latter, however, was
of little use, as he was usually drunk during three parts
of the day. The Sisters, however, did not look harshly
on this little vice of his, for the fellow was a most fervent
Catholic, who never failed to go to Confession, and to
High Mass every Sunday.</p>

<p>I had been about half an hour in my bed, when one of
the Sisters brought me a cup of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tisane</i>, a kind of tea made
of harmless herbs, which is always given in case of sickness,
whatever may be the disease one may be suffering
from. That Sister was a middle-aged woman, with hard,
drawn features; the turned-down corners of her mouth
expressed a violent temper, and a square chin showed
indomitable energy. She sat down near me, and asked
me if I was a Catholic. I replied that I had been baptized
a Roman Catholic, but that I did not approve of the
teachings of that religion, all my tendencies being Protestant.
She expressed absolute horror at my being so
plain-spoken, and told me that all the patients who were
Roman Catholics were expected to go to Confession
and Mass every Sunday. "If they don't," she added,
"we can't compel them, and that is their own look out,
but they do not usually stay here very long. You had
better think the matter over, my lad," she added, as she
arose from her chair. "I will send, in any case, the
chaplain to talk to you of your spiritual state." I thanked
her, but had no wish to discuss matters with her.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon the head doctor of the hospital,
who was Surgeon-major to the infantry regiment, and
held the rank of Major, came on a visit of inspection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
When he came to my bedside, he did not even give me a
word of greeting, but looked at the board which hung at
the head of my bed, and reading the diagnosis made by
our regimental doctor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Again a Dragoon," he said. "Why can't Dr. Lesage
keep his patients in his own dispensary? Why did he
send you here?" he went on, addressing me.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," I answered; "I suppose he found
that I needed to be sent here."</p>

<p>"Well, let me see your throat."</p>

<p>He examined me, and remarked to the Sister that there
was nothing much the matter with me, and that, although
I might have a slight rise of temperature, every man had
fever sometimes, adding that, if every Dragoon who had
fever was to be sent to hospital, the place would soon be
overflowing. He walked away with the Sister, and I
could see that they were having an animated conversation.
The doctor then came back to my bed:</p>

<p>"I hear," he said, "that you are a d&mdash;&mdash;d heathen; is
that so?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied; "I told the Sister that I did not
approve of the Roman Catholic religion, and that, although
I had been baptized a Roman Catholic, I was a Protestant
at heart."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "that is all the same; you are a heathen,
and you ought to be ashamed of yourself. That is why,
I suppose, Dr. Lesage sent you here. He likes heathens,
and I don't. Well, he can look after you if he chooses."
And, turning on his heel, he walked off.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon Dr. Lesage came to see me, and
I told him what had taken place. He said that he was
not in the least surprised, and that he was thoroughly
disgusted with the bigotry of all the people connected with
the place. He then called the Sister, and told her to
show him the register where the head surgeon had written
out his orders concerning my case. After looking through
it, he told me that, just as he had expected, the head surgeon
had put me on ordinary rations, but that he was not going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to have it; and he immediately ordered that I should be
put on a diet of chicken, eggs, and the like. He found my
throat very bad, and said that I ought to have come to see
him much sooner than I did. He also explained to me
that he would give orders enabling me to get from outside
whatever food I fancied, as well as books; he promised
too to come and see me on the following day. I took
advantage of his permission to send the hospital orderly
to fetch me a stock of eatables, books, and some newspapers.</p>

<p>Our dinner was served at six o'clock, and I was much
astonished when the Sister brought me a piece of beef which
had been boiled to a rag to make soup. I reminded her
that Dr. Lesage had put me on "fowl and egg diet."</p>

<p>"I know it," she said, "but, as there is none to be had
to-night, you will have to put up with what there is."</p>

<p>I pointed out to her that rations of fowl had been served
to at least six of the other patients.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "the fact is there is none left."</p>

<p>Upon this I declared that, unless I had a portion immediately
brought to me, I would forthwith send a letter to
Dr. Lesage to explain how matters stood.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "please don't trouble yourself, and I'll
go to the kitchen, and see if there is some remaining."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later she returned with the wing of a fowl,
and when I had finished it she brought me an omelet. I
mention this incident to show the gross partiality which
is usually displayed by Sisters of Mercy in French hospitals.
Most of the patients, who belong to the humbler
classes, are afraid to complain, and I have constantly seen
patients who make a display of deep religious zeal treated
with the utmost attention, receiving the best of fare, while
others who were lax in the practice of religion, or who
had the misfortune to be Protestants, were given the commonest
food, even if the doctor had ordered special delicacies
for them. The Sisters of Mercy have absolutely
no training in nursing, and an English nurse, after a year's
hospital work, is far more efficient than Sisters of Mercy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
who have spent years in the wards. I do not mean to say
that there are not to be found among the Sisters touching
examples of disinterested devotion to their fellow creatures,
but, taking them as a class, their employment in hospitals
is not calculated to benefit the patients, and they are far
inferior to English trained nurses in education, manners,
and skill. They have no fear of dismissal, as, in case of
their failing to do their duty, they are merely removed to
the headquarters of their order. It is true that it would
be most difficult to replace them in French hospitals, as
there exists in France no body of trained nurses like those
in this country. The French lay nurses are almost
invariably middle-aged women of the charwoman type,
who have had no practical training, and are usually
addicted to drink. In the largest hospitals the administration
of drugs and the dressing of wounds devolves
entirely on the medical students, and nurses, whether
Sisters of Mercy or lay, merely stand in the wards to
watch the patients, and in case of need they have to go
and summon a student. While I was in the hospital, I witnessed
some shocking examples of the way in which
sufferers were treated. I remember one night when a
patient, who was suffering from a most serious attack of
jaundice, cried out to the Sister on duty for a basin. The
Sister, who was counting her beads and muttering prayers
in a half-dozing state, merely lifted her eyes dreamily
towards the patient, but took no notice. The poor fellow
called her again and again, and, seeing how matters stood,
I got out of bed, and, going to the Sister, called her attention
to the patient. "Go to bed," she said to me: "it is
no business of yours. The female attendant has gone out;
it is her work, and not mine, to carry basins about." I
thereupon went to fetch what was needed myself, and
rendered what help I could to my sick comrade. Facts
such as these help to explain why the poor in France
have a greater dread of the hospital than many people
have of the workhouse in England.</p>

<p>It took me a few minutes to find a basin that night, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
while I looked about I must have caught a chill, for the
following day I had a relapse. I had been rather upset,
too, by the death of the typhoid patient in the bed next
to mine. His old mother came with his father that afternoon,
and their distress was heartrending to witness.</p>

<p>"They have taken my boy, they have killed him," the
poor mother kept repeating; complaining bitterly that she
had not been informed of his illness till too late.</p>

<p>Two days later, early in the morning, as luck would
have it, none other than Piatte was brought into the
hospital; he was carried on a stretcher, and carefully laid
in the vacant bed next to mine.</p>

<p>"You see, old chap," he said, "I would not leave my
chum Decle, so here I am."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, broken leg, that is all."</p>

<p>The two cavalry and infantry doctors then arrived, and
Piatte was questioned as to the way in which the accident
occurred.</p>

<p>"It's a beast of a charger that's kicked me in the
stables," he told the doctor.</p>

<p>He was carefully examined, and the doctors found that
he had broken his leg below the knee. The limb was set,
and although the poor fellow must have suffered dreadfully,
beads of perspiration running down his face during
the process, he did not utter a single complaint. Dr.
Lesage remained near him after the others had retired,
and told him that he would soon be all right.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's nothing, sir," said Piatte; "but look here,
sir, I'll tell you what: if you would like to do me a great
favour you would come and look after me yourself. <i>You</i>
can do anything you like to me, but I do not want that
other infantry doctor to mess about with me."</p>

<p>Dr. Lesage promised that he would attend him, and
before retiring held out his hand to the injured man. This
evidently went to the poor chap's heart, and his eyes
moistened.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," he said; "thank you. It is good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of you to shake hands with me&mdash;a bad character as they
make me out. If the officers were all like you, why I
would jump into the fire for them&mdash;and mind you, sir, I
won't forget it."</p>

<p>Dr. Lesage retired, more moved than he liked to show.
When he had gone, I asked Piatte how he felt.</p>

<p>"A bit queer," he said; "but you don't know, old chap,
how well I worked it. I thought I had killed myself,
you know."</p>

<p>"Weren't you kicked?" I queried.</p>

<p>"Kicked," he said; "well, it wasn't a horse that
kicked me. I'll tell you how it all happened. When I
got out of prison yesterday, I said to myself, I must have
a spree, so, after 'Lights out,' I got over the wall. You
see, my old granny had sent me another ten francs for
the New Year, but, of course, being in prison, I only got
my money when I came out, so then I jumped over the
wall, and, my boy, I can tell you I had a grand booze.
At two o'clock this morning I said to myself, 'It is time
to go back.' So I got into the little lane at the back of
our stable, you know. The wall there on the top side of
the lane is only six feet high, so I easily got on top of it,
but on the other side there is a drop of at least thirty
feet, you know, alongside our stable. I had often done
it, and it was only thirty yards along the wall to get
to the back door of the barracks, where you can get
down quite easy. But last night it had been raining, and
freezing afterwards, so that the wall was that slippery that
I had to walk on all-fours to keep my balance. I was a
bit on, I suppose, and I don't know how it happened, but
just as I was getting near the end of the wall I slipped,
and down I went. Oh, my boy, what a drop it was! I
came down flop, and when I tried to rise it was no go;
one of my legs felt like cotton-wool. I knew that if I
called for help I should be nabbed, so I crept on all-fours
as far as the room. I then went to wake up Titi; he took
off my clothes and laid me on my bed. By jove! didn't
it hurt me. Titi says to me, 'Let me go and call for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
help, you can say that you have fallen down stairs.' But I
say, 'No, that's no go, and it won't wash.' So we arranged
with Titi, that just before <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réveille</i> he would take me down
to the stables, which he did. By God, you don't know
what it meant to go to the stables: I felt my heart in my
mouth the whole way; to come down the stairs I sat
down, and holding on to Titi's neck, I let myself slide,
and then to cross the yard I tried to stand on my other
leg, but it was all numb; so I sent Titi to fetch Monard,
and between them they carried me to the stables and lay
me behind your kicking mare, as she's known as a kicker.
As soon as the others come down to clean the stables, I
shout, 'Ah, murder, murder!' One of them goes and
fetches the Sergeant, and I tell him how, passing behind
your mare's heels, I got kicked. Titi, in the meantime,
had gone to fetch me a stiff glass of brandy, as I felt
pretty queer. The Sergeant then sent for a stretcher,
and they carried me to the dispensary. When the doctor
came I told him I had been kicked, and when he looks at
my leg, he says: 'It's jolly funny that it should have got
swollen up so quickly.' Of course I told him that I have
got a queer constitution, and he says, 'Yes, a queer constitution
indeed,' and then he tells the Corporal that I
must be taken to the hospital at once, and he sends everybody
out of the room, and he says to me:</p>

<p>"'It was not a horse that kicked you, eh, Piatte?'</p>

<p>"'Well, sir,' I says, 'if you ask me, not as an officer,
but as the gentleman that you are, I will tell you the
truth.'</p>

<p>"'Go on,' he says, ''tis not as an officer that I am
asking you.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, then,' says I, 'that mare, sir, that kicked me,
'twas a paving-stone.' And I tell him the whole story,
from beginning to end, and then he got very wild, and
asked why I hadn't sent for him at once, and he also
asked whether I supposed that he would give me away.</p>

<p>"My boy," concluded Piatte, "he is a ripper, that
man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I remember one day&mdash;it was two years ago&mdash;I went to
the medical visit, and he says, 'What is the matter with
you?' so I replied, 'I rather tell you privately, sir,' and
he says, 'Very well.' After the medical visit he calls
me to his room. 'Well?' he says. I then told him what
was the matter with me, and as it is the rule, you know,
that men suffering with that complaint are punished
with thirty days' confinement to barracks, I asked him
if he would mind keeping it dark. 'Of course,' he
said, and he sent me to the dispensary for a fortnight
for rheumatism. Now don't you think that he was a
brick?"</p>

<p>I quite agreed with him. This matter is one which has
given rise to many discussions in Parliament, and in the
English Press, especially with regard to the British troops
in India. The French system appears to me one of the
chief causes of depopulation in France, when one considers
that nine-tenths of the male population have to
pass through the ranks of the army. The fear of
punishment prevents most soldiers from attending the
medical visit when they suffer from complaints of this
kind, and the consequence is that in most cases they wait
until the disease has made such progress that the doctors
are unable to cope successfully with it.</p>

<p>The day Piatte was brought to hospital the Roman
Catholic chaplain came to see me. I told him exactly
what my religious views were, but far from showing himself
offended, he showed me the utmost kindness, and asked
me to go and visit him when I was able to leave my bed.
I did so, and found him a most enlightened man. I
frankly explained to him my views, and although we
could not, of course, agree, our discussion was carried on
in the most courteous terms, and he told me that although
he regretted that he was unable to convince me, he should
always be glad to see me, placing at the same time his
fine library at my disposal. He was a man well versed
in science, and, although a fervent Catholic, did not consider
those whose opinions differed from his as black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
sheep, and he had the utmost respect for sincere religion
of every kind.</p>

<p>I stopped a week longer in hospital, and felt rather
glad of Piatte's companionship, as I had taken quite a
liking for this poor fellow, who interested me. I asked
him many a time why he did not give up drink, which
meant his ruin.</p>

<p>"Give up drink, old fellow," he invariably replied,
"why should I? It is the only thing which makes a
man forget. Don't imagine that I was a drunkard before I
came to the regiment; but they've driven me to it. During
my first year's service I was keen on doing my best, and
I hoped to be promoted to the rank of Corporal. I had
got through the exams all right, and had been actually
nominated for promotion after the man&oelig;uvres we were in
the thick of were over, when the crash came. One night,
when three other troopers and myself had made ourselves
comfortable in a barn full of straw, in comes a Corporal
with a pipe in his mouth. Just then he hears a step
outside, and suspecting that it is an officer, he shouts
out:</p>

<p>"'Who's been smoking here? Now look sharp&mdash;are
you going to tell me or not?'</p>

<p>"I wasn't asleep, and I saw through his dirty trick in
an instant. The other fellows were soon aroused, and
confusedly asked what was the matter. The Corporal
repeats his question, but of course there was no culprit
to answer it. Then in comes the officer&mdash;for the
Corporal's suspicion was right enough.</p>

<p>"'Go and fetch a lantern,' says he.</p>

<p>"Off goes the Corporal and gets one.</p>

<p>"Then the officer says:</p>

<p>"'Some one has been smoking here, let the man come
forward.'</p>

<p>"Of course nobody moves because nobody has done it,
for 'twas the Corporal all along.</p>

<p>"'Very well,' the officer says; 'let's have your
numbers,' and he tells the Corporal to put them down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mine was the highest as it happened, and on finding
this out the officer says:</p>

<p>"'You put eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> to that trooper.'</p>

<p>"When the officer has gone I go out to the Corporal&mdash;he
was a Hussar chap, and so was the officer&mdash;and I
tell him that it's not right what he's done, and that he knows
well enough that it's him that had been smoking, so he
turns savage on me, and he says:</p>

<p>"'You'll have two days more for insulting me.'</p>

<p>"The next day I tell what's happened to my Lieutenant,
and he says that he will speak to the Hussar officer; but
my Lieutenant comes back, and he says that the officer
doesn't mind cancelling my punishment, but that the
Corporal insists on letting his two days stand as they are,
and that he won't cancel them. All that makes a shindy
between the younger officers of our regiment and those
of the Hussars, and the General hears of it, because two
of them officers actually applied for leave to fight a duel.
The General sends for me&mdash;he was just mad because
during the past fortnight two other barns had been set
on fire&mdash;and he tells me I am a scoundrel to have smoked
in the barn; but I tell him how things happened, and that
'twas the Corporal himself who'd been smoking. The
Colonel of the Hussars, who just happened to be coming
for some report to the General, says:</p>

<p>"'Ah, that's the swine who nearly set a barn on fire
last night, and now he tries to take away the character of
one of my Corporals!'</p>

<p>"This makes the General quite mad, and he gives me
fifteen days' prison. Yes, old chap, fifteen days' prison,
when I'd done nothing. It fairly turned my blood, and I
went away hardly knowing what I was doing. I passed
a pub and went in. I called for absinthe and brandy and
the Lord knows what else. The more I drunk the more I
wanted, and I was that mad that when two Hussars walked
into the pub I sprang on them, and if others hadn't come
to their rescue 'twould have been a case of murder, I
think. They had to tie me up, and by Gad it took eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of them to do it. To my first punishment, fifteen days'
prison, and fifteen days' solitary confinement in cells, were
added, and when, two days later, the man&oelig;uvres ended,
I was marched back to barracks&mdash;a prisoner. Of course
any question of promotion was at an end&mdash;to think of it
after I had worked so hard to become a Corporal! When
I came out of prison I no longer cared a b&mdash;&mdash; d&mdash;&mdash; what
happened to me. I drank whenever I had money, and if
I hadn't, Decle, my boy, I would have shot myself. How
I have got through these last three years I don't know.
They threatened more than once to send me to Biribi.
What did I care? If it hadn't been for our late Colonel&mdash;he
understood me, that man&mdash;I should have done something
desperate; but since he is dead&mdash;ah, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malheur</i>! The
new Colonel calls me a disgrace to the regiment, and a
disgrace to the French army: but what do I care? But
then when a chap like our doctor doesn't feel ashamed to
hold out his hand to me&mdash;well, my boy, it goes to my
heart. You, too, old Decle, although we are both mere
troopers, you are a gentleman, while I am but a labourer
and a low blackguardly drunkard; and yet you treat me
as a friend. Give me your hand, old boy."</p>

<p>I gave it to him, and he pressed it between his two
enormous palms, and then, in a husky voice, he added,</p>

<p>"Ah! it's long since I have felt so happy," and with
the back of his hand he wiped off a tear.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, old chap," he said, "I know I'm making
a fool of myself!"</p>

<p>For answer I could only squeeze his hand, and I
turned round to hide a tear of my own&mdash;a tear of pity for
the poor fellow whose feelings I could now understand
so well.</p>

<p>During the long days we spent together Piatte delighted
to speak of his home; he belonged to the country, where
he drove a diligence: he loved horses and animals, and he
was still full of old and quaint superstitions. "I was
seventeen," he once said to me, "when I drove a coach for
the first time, and I shall never forget that night. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
never driven the coach except to bring it round from the
stables to the inn, when one night the governor orders
the diligence to be got ready for a foreign gentleman who
wanted to catch a train twenty miles from our place. All
the other carriages were out, and the diligence alone was
available. When Jean-Paul, the usual driver, hears of it
he says that he will not drive it for all the money in the
world, it being a Friday night in the month of January.
'Why?' I asked him. He told me that at one place where
the road meets the Strasbourg road there was a ghost
which always came out from behind a tree when the
diligence passed along at night on a Friday in January:
'his grandfather, his father, and him too had seen it, and
he did not want to see it no more.' I didn't believe
much in ghosts, so I offered to drive, and my governor, to
whom the coach belonged, let me go. The horses were
fresh, the carriage light, and we were rattling along at a
good pace when all of a sudden I see a woman dressed in
white jump from behind a tree and stand in the middle of
the road. 'Hi! hi! look out!' I shout, but she did not
seem to heed me, and before I could pull up the leaders
were on her. They shied and reared, but there she rises
between the two of them and seems to jump over the
wheelers, and for a second or two she flitters in front of
me like a huge bat. As I looked round I saw that we
were just at the spot which Jean-Paul had told me was
haunted. I felt my heart in my mouth, and lashing the
horses put them at a gallop&mdash;and they didn't want no
urging either; but the ghost seemed to fly in the air
alongside the coach for a distance of about a hundred
yards, when she disappeared in a bush."</p>

<p>I told Piatte that it was the effect of his imagination, but
he was positive about it; according to him the ghost had the
face of a young girl with very dark hair, and was draped in
white garments with a kind of hood over her head.</p>

<p>Soon after his first adventure he became the regular
driver of the diligence, the former driver having been upset
with the coach and killed on the spot. During the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
previous to his military service he had worked in some
large engineering works, and he always swore to me that
until he was first punished he had never been drunk,
adding at the same time that during the fourteen months
he had still to serve he meant to drink whenever he could
get a chance. I thoroughly believe that if he had become
a Corporal he would have been one of the best men in the
regiment, and there is no doubt that it was the injustice
with which he had been treated which led him to drink
and degradation.</p>

<p>At the end of ten days I left hospital, and, on my return
to barracks, was kept for three days in the dispensary as
a convalescent. During the whole time I had been in
hospital I had been unable to get a bath, and when I
suggested taking one the doctor laughed at me, and the
Sisters considered me a kind of lunatic to want a bath
when I had a sore throat. It was therefore with great
relief that, on my return to barracks, I was allowed by
our doctor to go out to the town to have the wash of
which I was naturally in great need.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>


<p>At the end of January we passed our first examination.
Each one of us had to command in turn the various kinds
of drill we had been taught so far&mdash;viz., drill on foot without
arms, carbine and sword drill, as well as mounted drill
in the riding-school. We were also examined on hippology
and the first principles of topography, and were
questioned on that portion of the regulations which
referred to the duties of Corporals, and we were further
examined as to our individual proficiency in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voltige</i> and
gymnastics. There was not a single one of us who hadn't
received by that time a more complete military education
than any of the Corporals in the regiment, but although
troopers can, according to the regulations, be promoted to
the rank of Corporal at the end of three months' service,
none of us received any promotion. I was the fifth by
marks out of the fourteen of us. After this examination the
order of our day's work was altered, and mounted drill,
instead of taking place in the riding-school, was carried
out on the man&oelig;uvring ground, about three miles outside
the town. This was a vast area of loose sand, a certain
portion of which was prepared for different exercises.
There were jumps too of various kinds, but none of them
above three feet high. The most peculiar arrangement
was what we call the "crater," a huge hole about thirty
yards in diameter, and from ten to twelve feet in depth,
shaped like a crater, and tapering at the bottom. There
was also a narrow defile some hundred feet long, just
broad enough to allow the passage of four riders abreast.
For the present, however, no use was made of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
obstacles, but we went on drilling as we had done in the
riding-school. Squares were marked out with huge poles,
and we rode in Indian file around them. Half an hour
before the time fixed for mounted drill four of us were
sent out under the command of a Corporal to mark the
squares. We were all very keen to be selected for this
work, for having to carry the poles we were allowed to
ride with stirrups, and when we had marked the squares,
we always had ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to
spare, during which time we used to jump our horses and
canter round the man&oelig;uvring ground. We also began
mounted drill with arms&mdash;viz., carbine and sword. In my
time swords were not fixed to the saddle as they are
now, and we invariably carried our carbines slung over our
backs, the boot never being used. Most cavalry officers
considered the carrying of the carbine in the boot a most
dangerous plan, likely to break the trooper's leg in case of
a fall. The carrying of the carbine across the back, on the
other hand, was a most cruel torture, especially as we were
never allowed to use our stirrups. The French cavalry
carbines are much heavier and longer than those in use in
the English cavalry. (We had, of course, the Gras pattern
in my time.) On Saturdays, besides undergoing the
weekly inspection, we had to prepare a number of horses
for the infantry officers. The Captains in command of
infantry companies being mounted, Lieutenants and Sub-lieutenants
had to be taught riding, and few of them had
any idea of what riding a horse meant, their only knowledge
of such animals being derived from seeing them in the
streets. Of course the Sergeants who had drawn up the
lists of the horses to be used by the infantry officers
took a secret pleasure in selecting the hardest trotters as
well as the most vicious chargers in each squadron, so
that my little mare was invariably chosen. The costumes
donned by the infantry officers for this riding lesson were
rather peculiar. Most of them wore patent leather gaiters
over their trousers, while a few appeared in tightly-fitting
grey breeches. As we brought our chargers to them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
timid learners always carefully inquired about the special
vice of each.</p>

<p>I well remember the appearance one day of a young
infantry Lieutenant putting any amount of "side" on,
and adorned by a resplendent pair of patent leather top-boots.</p>

<p>"I say, Dragoon," he said quietly, slipping a two-franc
piece into my hand, "that looks rather a nice little horse
you're holding there."</p>

<p>"It isn't a horse, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>He looked much astonished, and said: "What! You
don't call it a mule, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied; "I call it a mare."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes!" he said. "A mare, of course. Fact
is, I'd hardly looked at her. Is she lively?" he added.
"I don't like a beast with the paces of a donkey!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I said; "you'll find her quite lively
enough."</p>

<p>"But she's not vicious&mdash;not vicious?" he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Vice!" I replied. "She doesn't know what vice
means. She likes to show off a bit, that's all."</p>

<p>"Just what I like," said the Lieutenant. He asked me
to get on her back, and after I had made her prance about
a bit, I dropped the reins on her neck, and pulling a bit of
sugar from my pocket I made her turn her head to eat it
from my hand&mdash;a trick I had taught her.</p>

<p>"What a jolly little beast!" said the Lieutenant, as I
dismounted; "mind," he added, "that you do not let anybody
else ride her." "No fear, sir," I answered, upon
which he tipped me another franc. I was careful to bring
the mare last of all into the riding-school, having purposely
put the stirrup-straps three holes too long for my man.
The Lieutenant walked up to me. He looked at the girths
as if he knew everything about a saddle, and then measured
the stirrups, asking me if I thought they were right.
"It's not for me, sir," I replied, "to presume to advise a
gentleman like you, who probably has horses of his own."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
"Of course&mdash;of course," he replied, highly flattered. "I
should say you're a rare 'un with horses," I again said.
"How do you know?" he asked proudly. "I can tell a
gentleman when I see one," I answered. "Just so," he
went on patronisingly. "I suppose you've been in good
houses before?" "That's just it, sir," I innocently
replied. Just then our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capitaine Instructeur</i>, who gave
the lesson to the infantry officers, rode into the riding-school
and ordered the officers to mount. We had to hold
our charger's head and the off-stirrup, and the Lieutenant
having got on to the mare remarked that the stirrups
were rather long. "How many holes, sir?" "Just
shorten those two holes," he said. Purposely I went on
slowly shortening one of the stirrups, holding the mare's
head at the same time, and, as I fully expected, before I
had time to touch the second stirrup our Captain commanded
the Lieutenants to fall in, and I let go at once the
mare's head, and she began to prance about. Her rider,
who knew nothing of riding, foolishly pulled on the
bit and pressed his legs to keep his equilibrium. My
mare, greatly resenting such treatment, darted forward
into the middle of the riding-school, plunging and rearing.
In a second or two the officer was landed on the ground,
while our Captain coolly asked him what he was doing
there? He replied that it had all happened because his
stirrups were not right. In the meantime I had rushed
to catch the mare, and as the Lieutenant came to remount,
our Captain told me to put the stirrups to their
proper length. While I was doing so the poor young
Lieutenant whispered to me: ""<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais c'est une bête
terrible que cet animal</span>."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> I advised him not to use the
curb, and not to touch her with his heels, as she did not
like it. "It is very difficult not to use the heels," he replied,
with dismay, "I wish I had never seen that beast."</p>

<p>The poor fellow knew even less about riding than I had
thought, and I soon regretted having recommended him to
take my mare, as twice more she landed him in the middle
of the school, and ultimately the Captain commanding the
lesson made him change horses with one of his colleagues.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>To return to our own work. Shortly after we had
started drilling on the man&oelig;uvring ground, we began to
drill by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pelotons</i> on foot. The cavalry drill on foot is
essentially different from the infantry drill, as all the
movements are performed in the same way as the mounted
drill; for instance, the troopers being dressed on two
ranks, to break off by fours they swing on a pivot as if
they were mounted, and the drill on foot is, indeed,
especially intended as a preparation for the mounted drill.
Our work in the field, however, consisted of two distinct
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôles</i>: we had to act as cavalry and at the same time as
mounted infantry, although we were absolutely unfit for the
latter work. I have often discussed with French officers
the question why mounted infantry have never been tried in
France, but all the French officers seem to believe them
to be practically useless. They point out that all the
French cavalry being drilled and armed in such a way as
to be able to act as mounted infantry, there is no necessity
for the latter. This is all very well in theory, but it is out
of the question in practice. All the trooper is fit for when
dismounted is to defend himself, but the moment he is
sent forward on foot, his heavy, cumbersome trousers, his
boots with spurs nailed on to them, and fitting as loosely
as they always do, are a terrible burden to him. More
than once when we were sent out as sharpshooters
through heavy ground, we had not gone 200 yards before
our boots came off our feet; in this respect it may therefore
be safely said that, whatever their other qualities may
be, the French are very inferior to the English or German
cavalry.</p>

<p>Too much time is wasted in educating the troopers to
drill on foot, and nothing is done to develop individual
initiative in the field. There were not ten of the troopers
in my regiment who could have been trusted alone as
scouts, and even among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, men who had
all received a good education, not one half of them at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
end of the year's training thoroughly understood the use
of a map, and with the exception of Delbruck and myself
not one could have made a sketch-plan, however rough, of
the ground we had been over. Another of the great mistakes
made throughout the whole of the French army is
the tendency to overburden soldiers as well as horses.
Cavalry horses have to carry in the field a kit which,
including the rider, amounts to an average of 22 stone,
in the light cavalry the kit is, it is true, a little lighter, but
there is hardly a stone and a half difference. The light
cavalry horses are small, few of them being over
15 hands, while many are under. In the heavy cavalry
there is hardly a horse standing 16 hands high, and the
average size ranges between 15·1 and 15·2. In the
infantry, soldiers have to carry in the field, cartridges
included, an average of over 80 lbs. During the Madagascar
war this enormous burden was not even reduced, and
naturally 50 per cent. of the men died within five months
of the beginning of the campaign. Another great fault
of the French system is that too much is expected of the
troopers, instead of their being regarded exclusively as
mounted men.</p>

<p>Their uniform is not only grotesque, but is quite
unsuitable for riding. I have often heard it said that
the introduction of top-boots and breeches would entail
too heavy an expenditure&mdash;but the Germans have them,
and their cavalry is not inferior in numbers to the French.
But this is a digression.</p>

<p>Our Sergeant Legros was as great a bully as ever;
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were constantly being punished, and never
a week elapsed without my being sent to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de
Police</i>; in fact, Legros got so accustomed to punishing
me that many a time he used to say to me in the morning,
"I am in a bad temper to-day, and you'll get two days'
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>&mdash;you'll find out why latter on." At other
times he used to tell us that he meant to stick four of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> in the lock-up that day, and, true to his
word, he always found some cause for punishing exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
four of us during the day. I had become so used to
punishment by that time that it had grown quite indifferent
to me, and I became a mere dare-devil.</p>

<p>One day having been sent to the lock-up <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l'&oelig;il</i>,
I found that the Sergeant of the Guard was my friend
de Lanoy, and he told me that I could go and sleep in my
own bed. As my punishment had not been reported, he
ran no risk, but unfortunately for me that night I made a
fool of myself. Titi, whom I had told that de Lanoy had
excused me from sleeping in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, came to
tell me a long story of how his brother had come to see
him on most important business, and how he could not
get leave to go out to him, adding that he was sure I
would help him. I told him that I would willingly do so
if I could, and he then unfolded his plan to me. "You
see," he went on, "when the Sergeant of the Week comes
for the roll-call at eight o'clock, the Corporal will report
you as being in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, but what you will
really do will be to get into my bed and cover your head
well up, so that your face can't be seen, and then they
will think that it is me. In the meantime I shall have
got out, letting myself down from the window into the
street with my forage rope." Foolishly enough, I agreed
to the plan. At a quarter to eight Piatte, who had long
left the hospital, helped me to let Titi down through the
window, and as soon as he had landed safely in the street
I went and wrapped myself up in Titi's bed. Piatte, I
must say, tried to dissuade me, but having promised Titi,
I said I would certainly keep my word. I covered up my
head, and soon after, the Sergeant of the Week walked
round the room to make the evening call. When he
passed in front of my bed he walked straight up to me
and pulled the blankets off. "What are you doing here?"
he cried. "Sergeant," I replied, "Sergeant de Lanoy has
allowed me to sleep here instead of in the lock-up."
"And that is why," he said, "you sleep in another
man's bed, after you have helped him to get out through
the window. You will have four days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
And now," he added, "off you go to the cells." The
Sergeant was a new one who had exchanged into the
regiment a few days previously, so he was a stranger to
me, and though immediately after the call I rushed after
him, he had already walked into the Sergeant-major's
office and reported the matter to him. When he came out
I asked him to cancel my punishment, not so much for
my sake, as for de Lanoy's, who might be severely
punished for having excused me from sleeping in the
cells. The Sergeant expressed his regret, but told me it
was too late, as he had already reported the matter to the
Sergeant-major, adding that he was absolutely unconscious
that by so doing he might bring one of his comrades into
trouble. I advised him to go and see Sergeant Legros at
once, in order to urge him not to lodge a complaint
against de Lanoy, adding that I wished to take the
whole blame upon myself.</p>

<p>I was very glad to find the following day that de Lanoy
had not been embroiled in the business. I did not
fare so well. The four days the Sergeant had given me
were altered to eight by our Captain, and the Colonel
added four more to the total, so that I had twelve days
in all. I can honestly say that this was the only punishment
I fully deserved among all those which were
bestowed on me. Titi also got fifteen days, so that we
were once more companions in misfortune. It was
during that time that our Sergeant-major suddenly altered
his behaviour towards me. I had been about three days
in the lock-up when one afternoon he called me into
his office and locked the door. He looked much embarrassed,
but asked me to sit down, and offered me a
cigarette and a glass of beer. This seemed a very extraordinary
proceeding on his part, but I accepted the
proffered hospitality and waited for him to open the
conversation. "I am sorry, Decle," he said, "that you
should have been once more punished, but I'll try to make
your punishment as light as possible, and I have already
given instructions that you are not to sleep in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to-night, as I am acting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> to-day." I thanked
him, and silence followed. "By the way," he said, "I have
also sent for you to ask your advice. You are a gentleman
and a man of the world, and I want some information,
but before I consult you I want your word of honour that
you will not mention to a living soul what I am going to
tell you." I assured him that he could make his mind
easy on this point and reckon on my silence. "Well, it
is just this," he began: "I am in a fix, and I want to
borrow five hundred francs (£20), and unless I get the
money within a fortnight I shall be a disgraced man. You
know how strict the Colonel is, and how severely he
punishes non-commissioned officers who are in debt.
Now don't you know a Jew who would lend me the
money?"</p>

<p>I replied that I was not acquainted with money-lenders,
but that in any case I was quite certain that none of the
fraternity would advance him the money unless he could
give some substantial security. "I could give my pay," he
replied; "wouldn't that be sufficient security?" I fairly
laughed in his face. "Your pay," I said; "why, it does
not amount to twenty pounds a year; that would be no
security at all." The man must have been in a fix
indeed, for he grew pale and trembled visibly. Once
more he told me that unless he had the money his
creditor would apply to the Colonel, and that would mean
the ruin of his military career. "I tell you what," I then
said; "why should you go to money-lenders? Let me
lend you the money, and you can repay me whenever you
like." He protested that he could not possibly accept
money from me, but I assured him that I could well afford
it, and at last he said that he accepted my offer, but that
he did not know how to express his gratitude. I knew
perfectly well that from the outset he had meant to get the
money out of me, but I was not going to let him off so
easily as he imagined. I therefore told him that, although
I would be very glad to let him have the money, I could
not give it to him in a lump sum, as my allowance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
only paid to me monthly, and I added that my money
being in Paris, I should have to go there to fetch it, and
that, having eleven more days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> to undergo, I
should have to wait until I had finished my punishment,
and until I got leave. "Oh," he replied, "I will arrange
that for you. To-day is Monday, and I'll see that your
punishment is put down as finishing on Saturday morning,
and then I'll give you leave to go to Paris from
Saturday night till Monday night. You see," he went on,
"I am acting as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> during the whole of this week, and
I need not report you missing, so nobody will be the wiser."</p>

<p>I thanked him, but he replied most courteously that it
was from himself that the thanks were due, and he added
that he was very sorry he had hitherto misunderstood me,
but that in future he would be delighted to do anything he
could on my behalf. I retired, feeling much pleased with
myself, as I knew that in future I should have a devoted
friend in my Sergeant-major, whose power was far
greater than that of any of the officers of our squadron.
For instance, no officer, with the exception of the
Captain commanding the squadron, would dare take upon
himself to grant a trooper twenty-four hours' leave <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sub
rosâ</i>, while the Sergeant-major could do this easily, merely
by not reporting the trooper as missing from the calls, and
even should an officer inquire where the trooper was, the
Sergeant-major could always reply that he had given the
man leave not to attend the "stables," which he was
entitled to do; moreover, as no officer was ever present at
the night-call, the Sergeant-major could deal with that
roll exactly as he liked. On the Saturday my Sergeant-major
kept his promise, and told me to get dressed immediately
after "stables." He advised me, however, to go
to my rooms in the town to change my uniform for
civilian clothes, as that week the platoon at the station
was supplied by the infantry. I should explain here that
soldiers on leave who are allowed to leave their garrison
town are supplied with a paper stating that they are permitted
to go to a specified place outside the garrison. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
order to prevent soldiers leaving the garrison without
leave, a non-commissioned officer is sent every Saturday
and Sunday to the railway-station, and makes the soldiers
show him their written leave before they are allowed to
take their ticket.</p>

<p>When I was dressed to go out my Sergeant-major
accompanied me as far as the hotel, and we had a chat
while I was changing my clothes. He told me incidentally
that he had re-enlisted one year before, and that he
hoped to be sent to the school of Saumur within the next
two years, which would enable him to become an officer in
three years' time, and he again insisted on the fact that if
the Colonel found out that he was in debt he would lose
all chance of going to Saumur, and might even be reduced
to the rank of ordinary Sergeant.</p>

<p>I promised faithfully that I would bring back at least
100 francs from Paris, and I then jumped into a
brougham and ordered the blinds to be carefully drawn
down, as the fact of being seen in civilian attire would
have meant imprisonment at least. In order to avoid
meeting any of my officers, I had timed myself to go by a
slow train; but before I got out of the carriage I carefully
peeped round, and did not get out until I had made
certain there were no cavalry officers about. The traffic
superintendent was a personal friend of my family, and
he had given me a card specially recommending me to all
the stationmasters of the line, and allowing me to use
any train I chose, even goods trains. Privates are not as
a rule allowed to ride in first-class carriages, and non-commissioned
officers are also debarred from this privilege,
so that the traffic superintendent's card was doubly useful
to me, enabling me as it did to travel by express trains
which only contained first-class carriages. Upon entering
the station the stationmaster allowed me to stop in his
office until the last minute, and sent for my ticket, thus
reducing the chances of detection to a minimum. I
reached Paris safely, and when I returned the next
evening my Sergeant-major was waiting for me at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
hotel, in order to take me back into barracks without my
name being taken down by the Sergeant of the Guard,
who has to report the names of all troopers who come
in after evening call, the exact time at which they return
being entered against their names. I told my Sergeant-major
that I had been able to get 100 francs only, but
that I would get a further sum if I went to Paris the
following Sunday. He thanked me profusely, and told
me that he would arrange that I should go to Paris on
the following Saturday. It soon became an understood
thing that when I wanted to go to Paris without leave, I
was to ask him to arrange it for me, while on my return
I duly handed him from fifty to a hundred francs. Before
my first years' service was over the Sergeant-major had
been enabled to repay considerably more than twenty
pounds he owed to his obdurate creditor, but he still
maintained the fiction, and whenever I handed him over
the price of my journey to Paris, he thanked me warmly,
invariably adding, "Ah! I am so glad, I shall be able to
take that to my creditors to-morrow!" In this way the
Sergeant-major certainly received between fifty and sixty
pounds from me in all.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>


<p>Although my Sergeant-major had altered his behaviour
towards me, he could only help me in the squadron, having
no power over the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, who were under the absolute
command of Sergeant Legros. Captain Hermann, who
was nominally our chief, and who was supposed to give
us lectures twice a week, never took the trouble to do so,
and we scarcely ever saw him for more than a few minutes
at a time. He left, in fact, the whole of our instruction
in Legros' hands, and the latter's powers seemed to become
greater every week.</p>

<p>Hitherto, whenever we had wanted to apply for leave
we used to send our application through the usual channel,
handing it over to our Sergeant-major, who transmitted it
to the Captain; but the Colonel issued a regimental order
to the effect that in future any <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> wishing to get
leave would have to apply for it through Sergeant Legros.
Our Captain also strictly forbade us to apply for ten o'clock
or midnight leave from the officer of the week (to whom all
such demands were made by the other troopers), and told
us that in future we should have to apply on the Saturday
to Sergeant Legros for any leave we might wish to obtain.
He added that any <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> who applied for leave to the
Lieutenant of his company, or to the Sergeant-major, would
be punished with eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> for having done
so. It is needless to say that I never obtained a single
day's regular leave after that; but I cared little, as my
Sergeant-major had become so friendly to me that he used
to give me whatever leave I wanted.</p>

<p>It was at about this time that I met with rather a serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
accident. I was leading my mare and two other chargers
to the watering-tank, when one of the chargers was bitten
by the other, and rearing straight up in the air, came down
on my mare, who fell down on the top of me. I was
much bruised and nearly stunned, but fortunately no bones
were broken. I was led to the dispensary, and, after
examining me, the doctor ordered that I should be detained
there. I have already explained that there was a ward in
the place where sick troopers who were not ill enough to
be sent to hospital were placed under medical treatment.
The ward contained twelve beds, and adjoining it were two
rooms for non-commissioned officers. The beds were of
the usual military type, and the sick troopers were only
allowed the ordinary rations: those who could afford it,
however, being at liberty to send for extra food from the
canteen. There were no nurses attached to the dispensary,
and it was superintended by a Corporal assisted by one
trooper. I confess that I far preferred being there to
going to the hospital. During the ten days I passed in
the dispensary I made great friends with the Sergeant,
who was himself sick. He had enlisted before his time
for conscription was due, and his aim was to work his way
up to a commission from the ranks; but although he had
served already three years, he was thoroughly disgusted
with military service, and had made up his mind to leave
it at the end of his five years' engagement. He explained
to me that he stood absolutely no chance of being sent to
the Saumur school, as only three Sergeants were selected
every year, and, although he had passed the examination
some time previously, he was only fourth on the list. He
ought by rights to have been the second, but the two candidates
who were classed second and third had taken that
rank through their fathers' influence, one of them being
the son of an ex-Minister of State and the other of an
influential Senator. The Sergeant had but one more
chance, and he felt sure that another job would be perpetrated,
as among the next candidates stood the Colonel's
nephew and two sons of Generals. He added that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
only chance would be to re-enlist for another five years,
but he was not inclined to do this. He was a thorough
gentleman, and had had an excellent education, and he
naturally hated the life he led among ignorant comrades&mdash;men
who had no idea of common decency, and who were
addicted to the grossest immorality.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>As <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> had only to serve for one year instead
of for the five during which the other troopers had to be
under the flag, military instruction had to be carried out
a good deal more rapidly than in the case of the ordinary
recruits. As soon, therefore, as we had become proficient
in the use of our arms on horseback, and showed
that we understood thoroughly drilling on foot by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>,
we were put through mounted drill by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>. We
were taught to walk, trot, and gallop in two ranks, to
wheel to the right and to the left, to break off by fours
and by twos, and then to form again into line, each one
of us having to act in turn as commander of the company.
At first we had to execute all these movements
without stirrups, and a good deal of time was also devoted
to the improvement of our riding capacities. In this
respect our instruction was first-rate. We were first
taken over jumps singly, being taught to trot our
chargers until we got within twelve to fifteen feet of the
jump, when we had to let go the reins and get over the
jump with our hands behind our backs. We also had to
do the same with drawn swords, and without holding the
reins, the same movements being repeated with the
carbine held on the leg. Then we had to repeat the
exercises by twos and by fours, and after some time we
were taken over the jumps in two ranks. We were
also taught to pass through the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">défilé</i>, a most difficult
man&oelig;uvre.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<p>In order to complete the regulation number of thirty
troopers which form a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>, some old troopers were
added to our ranks. We were then started at a gallop,
wheeled round, and brought in front of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">défilé</i>. This,
as I explained before, consisted of a narrow lane between
two high hurdles, and was just broad enough to allow
four troopers to ride abreast. When we got within
twenty yards of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">défilé</i>, we had to form fours, and the
moment we had gone through it we had to form once
more in line. The passage through the crater at full
gallop was also a most exciting exercise. The two
troopers riding in the centre of the line had to pass down
the bottom of the crater while the others rode on the
slope; the centre of the front had to increase his pace so
as to keep our lines perfectly straight, and as we came
out of the crater our two lines had to be unbroken.</p>

<p>I was much astonished at the manner in which we
were taught to charge. Instead of charging in serried
ranks, the moment the command "Charge!" was given,
every trooper had to force his horse forward as hard as
he could go, without troubling to keep in line; in fact, it
resembled a race rather than the onset of a compact
mass. The troopers of the front rank charged with the
points of their swords held forward, while those of the
second rank held their swords high up, ready to cut
down their men, and as soon as the command had been
given every trooper had to shout at the top of his voice
three times, "Charge! Charge! Charge!" This, with
the clattering of the scabbards against our spurs, drove
the chargers to the highest pitch of excitement, and
every one of them went for all he was worth. We were
also taught to charge in serried ranks, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
explained to us that in case of war this mode of charging
would hardly ever be used, as it would enable modern
artillery to destroy whole regiments before they had been
able to reach the enemy. The charge over, the bugle
sounded "Assembly" (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ralliement</i>), and at this command
we had to re-form our line.</p>

<p>At the beginning of April we underwent a second
examination before a board consisting of the Captain and
the Commander of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Capitaine Instructeur</i>,
and one of the Majors. The three <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> who
obtained the first places were nominated Corporals after
the examination. One of them certainly fully deserved
his promotion, but the two others only obtained it
through interest; one of them in particular, who is now
Duc de &mdash;&mdash;, ought by rights to have been classed
among the two last, but his family was able to put great
pressure on our Colonel, and one of our Lieutenants, who
was his first cousin, helped him to obtain a place on the
list to which he was in no way entitled. The same
thing happens in the case of the promotion of officers in
France, and in some cases undeserved favour is shown
in an absolutely shameful way. I am well aware that in
all countries of the world family interest goes a long way&mdash;in
this country it is hard to get on without it&mdash;but at
least it may be said that the recipients of special favours
have always something to show to their credit, while
this is far from being the case under the French
Republic.</p>

<p>After we had passed our half-yearly examination we
began our duty as trained soldiers in earnest, and
besides company drill we were taken to the shooting-range
once a week, one day being also devoted to service
in the field. Our shooting, I confess, was very poor, but
this was chiefly due to the bad sighting of our carbines,
none of which were true. They were theoretically
sighted up to a thousand yards, but could not be relied
on above three hundred. The range was in the middle
of the forest, in an opening among stately trees, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
target stood at the foot of a small hill. While firing was
going on two of us were sent to patrol the approaches
on each side of the targets, as quite a number of poor
people used, at the risk of their lives, to lurk behind the
targets in order to pick up the bullets. The patrols had
strict orders to prevent any one from approaching within
two hundred yards of the butts, and we had to keep a
very sharp look-out, for these bullet-collectors were up
to many dodges to evade us. All of a sudden, for
instance, a couple of them showed themselves on the
road leading to the open space between the troopers and
the target, and although we shouted hard to warn them
off, they pretended to be deaf and not to hear us. We
had, of course, therefore, to gallop towards them, and as
we came up to them they pretended to be wood-gatherers
on their way home. Meanwhile, half a dozen others had
crawled under the bushes a couple of hundred yards
behind the targets, and we had thus to start off once
more at full gallop to clear the place of the new
intruders, as the shooting had to be interrupted the
moment they came in view. It was for that reason that
the best riders, mounted on the fastest chargers, were
usually selected for this patrol work, and I usually
managed to be sent out. I thoroughly enjoyed the work,
as it gave me the chance of a good gallop over rough
ground, and more than once we had quite exciting
chases across country after the most obdurate of the law-breakers.
I say "we," as after a short time it became
necessary to post two troopers on each side of the
targets, this decision having been come to on account of
an accident which happened while the infantry were
practising. An old woman had managed to creep, unseen
by the sentry, right across the line of fire, and just then
a volley was fired and she received two bullets in her
body.</p>

<p>I cannot speak at all highly of the way in which we
were taught field service. We were supposed to learn how
to direct ourselves, how to reach a specified point with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
help of a map, and how to report on the country we had
been across. The explanations given to us by our Sergeant
showed that he knew very little about the subject
himself, and I am certain that none of us ever understood
a word of his explanations. I was perhaps the only
trooper who knew anything technically about topography,
having begun at a very early age to go in for mountain-climbing;
and as this became a regular hobby with me I
had studied map-making, and had learnt not only to read
the smallest details of the map, but also to find my way
among the greatest difficulties, a detailed map representing
to me not only the roads, but also the whole contour
of the country, and the nature of its surface. During the
few years preceding my service I had also explored the
French Alps, forming the frontier between France and
Italy, of which no map had then been published, and I
had never failed to make rough surveys and triangulations
with the help of the prismatic compass, an instrument of
which I suppose our Sergeant had never even heard. It
was a great pity that we were never accompanied by an
officer on these field-days; but I do not remember our
Captain turning up more than once during the three
months this part of our education lasted. We were also
taught, after a fashion, how to take to pieces and to lay
down a railway line, and two or three times we were
shown how to use dynamite.</p>

<p>Such was our work during April and May; it could
certainly have been made most interesting but for the
terror we always stood in of being punished. So far as I
was concerned, I do not remember a fortnight elapsing
without my being sent to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, usually for
the most absurd reasons. Another great mistake which
was committed was that of never allowing us any personal
initiative; and we did not even dare to ask for any explanations.
One or two of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> having ventured to
do so met with a rebuff, accompanied by a punishment.</p>

<p>Shortly after the half-yearly examination we were also
told off to take the guard according to the roll in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
different squadrons. As our regiment had only the barrack
guard to supply, an individual trooper's turn only
came about once a month. Ordinary troopers were allowed
to get a comrade to take their turn for them, but
the Colonel issued an order to the effect that no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>
would be allowed to be replaced when his turn for taking
the guard came round. The troopers told off to take the
barrack guard numbered six, besides a trumpeter and two
stable guards, and were commanded by a Sergeant and a
Corporal&mdash;all of them selected from the same squadron.
Besides these troopers, two stable guards from each one of
the other squadrons had to be supplied at a few minutes
before 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The troopers nominated for guard duty
met in the yard at some distance from the guard-room,
and the Sergeant in command carefully examined each
man to ascertain that his equipment was in good order.
The officer of the week of the squadron who supplied
the guard also inspects the troopers' equipment, and the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> of the Week stands by, and at eight o'clock
sharp marches the incoming guard past the Captain of
the Week, halting the men in front of the guard-room.
He then gives the word, "Front!" and a fresh inspection
of each trooper is made by the Captain of the Week. At
the same time the outgoing guard has been formed up by
a Sergeant, and is marched away under the orders of the
outgoing Sergeant, who soon dismisses his men, and
returns with the Corporal to hand the service over to the
Sergeant who replaces him. He has also to make his
report to the Captain of the Week, or to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> in
the absence of the former. The sentries are then relieved
by the incoming Corporal and sent back to their rooms.
All the troopers who have been on guard the previous
day are excused from duty for four and twenty hours.
The first time I took the guard, the Captain of the Week
was an old Captain who was a perfect disgrace to the
regiment. He was constantly drunk, and while at one
time he would abuse the troopers in the vilest fashion, at
another he would display a familiarity which was most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
embarrassing. That morning, being in one of his furious
moods, he found something to say about the equipment of
every one of us, called us a set of dirty pigs, and told our
Sergeant that he was a worse pig than any of us.</p>

<p>"When I was a youngster," he added, "things were
different. Then we had soldiers&mdash;then we had an
Emperor; but now that is the lot of swine one has to
command," pointing out to us. "Look here," he went on,
"they have given me the Legion of Honour, but I am
ashamed of it; and you see," pointing to the decoration on
his breast, "their d&mdash;&mdash; Republic; I've put the head the
other way, so that it should not be seen!"</p>

<p>He then ordered the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> to dismiss us. He walked
into the guard-room, where a wooden camp-bed, similar
to the one in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, occupied the whole length
of the room, while a few forms, on which we could sit,
were scattered about. In a tiny recess adjoining this room
was a table. This was the portion of the guard-room
reserved for the Sergeant. We only had to supply two
sentries, one in front of the barrack gate and the other
near the entrance of the forage-store in a small side-street
some two hundred yards from the barracks. Our Corporal
made out the list of the sentries and stuck on the
wall a bit of paper on which he had written our rotation.
We had to be twenty-four hours on guard duty, so that
each one of us had to be on sentry-go four times, doing
two hours at a time, and with an interval of four hours
before his turn came round again. I was put on the
second turn, from 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to noon, 4 to 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, 10 to
12 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and 4 to 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The Sergeant and Corporal
were both on friendly terms with me, so that I did not
have too bad a time of it. I took a great deal of interest
in the duties of the Sergeant, and he explained to me what
an awkward task his was. Of course I was supposed to
have learned before all the routine of a Sergeant of the
Guard, but merely hearing a description read out gives
one but a poor idea of what things are in practice.</p>

<p>The Sergeant of the Guard is of course responsible for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the relieving of sentries (though the actual duty is left to
the Corporal); he has besides to see that the trumpeter is
punctual in the various calls, he is responsible for the
cleanliness of the various barrack-yards, and of the cells,
and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, and for all the sanitary arrangements
of the barracks. Whenever he requires troopers for
fatigue duty he gets the trumpeter to call the various
Corporals of the Week belonging to his squadron and tells
them how many men he requires. He has the right to
call the troopers who are punished with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> or
confinement to barracks, and order them for fatigue duty.</p>

<p>He has to examine every Sergeant, Corporal, and trooper
who goes out of barracks, and has power to prevent their
going out in the event of their outfit not being in proper
order. He has also to see that no strangers come into
the barracks without proper leave. After the night-call
he sees that the doors of the barracks are closed, visits
the stables to ascertain that no horses are loose, and that
the stable guards are at their posts. He has also during
the night to make rounds outside the barracks, and in
case a horse or a trooper is taken sick and requires
urgent help, he has to send round to call either the Vet.
or the doctor as the case may be. The regulations on
this subject are rather amusing, special stress being laid
on the fact that the Sergeant of the Guard must only send
on such an errand an <i>intelligent</i> trooper. There is no
doubt that a Sergeant taking the guard gets very little
opportunity for rest during the continuous twenty-four
hours he is on duty, especially if he is under the orders
of a strict <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>, or of an erratic Captain of the Week,
such as Captain des Tourelles, who was on duty the first
time I took the guard.</p>

<p>When I took my first turn as sentry I was put outside
the barrack gates, my instructions being as follows:</p>

<p>In case any officer up to the rank of Captain passed me
I was to shoulder arms, and if the officer was a Major or
Lieutenant-colonel I had to present arms; in case of our
Colonel coming to the barracks I was to present arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
shouting at the same time, "Aux armes!" all the troopers
in the guard-room having to turn out and to render him
military honours. I had to prevent strangers from going
out of barracks with a parcel, and was not to let any
Corporal or trooper out of barracks if they carried a parcel
or a carbine, unless the Sergeant of the Guard gave me
orders to the contrary. When I took my third turn
(from ten to twelve) I was placed as sentry before the
forage-store, and my orders were of the strictest&mdash;I had
to challenge anybody passing within ten yards of me, and
in case no reply was given to my challenge, I was to arrest
the offender and to call out for help. This last order was
well-meant, but the guard-room being over three hundred
yards away, I did not see how the others could possibly
hear me. I was also ordered to prevent any one from
approaching the wall of the store, and in case the offender
did not move away after being challenged three times I
had to fire on him. I had not, however, to salute any
officers, such honours being dispensed with after evening
call. For the first hour nobody passed through the
street, but towards half-past eleven I noticed Captain des
Tourelles coming along; he was rather unsteady in his
gait, and had to help himself by holding on to the wall.
When he came within the regulation distance I challenged
him, whereupon he leant against the wall of the store and
said: "That's all ri', my boy, it's all ri', it's me."</p>

<p>I walked up to him and respectfully told him that my
orders were to allow nobody to come near the wall of the
forage-store.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he said, "it's me."</p>

<p>I expostulated with him, but I could not get him to
budge, and I hardly knew what to do, when he pulled a
cigarette out of his pocket and asked me for a match. I
was well aware that if I allowed him to smoke near the
forage-store I became liable to be court-martialled, but, on
the other hand, if I laid hands on an officer I should also
be court-martialled, so while he was fumbling in his pocket
for a match I said to him, "Look here, sir, this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
forage-store, and you know that I can't let you smoke
here."</p>

<p>"The forage-store," he replied, "the forage-store&mdash;shpose
can't smoke&mdash;here, you smoke it for me, my boy,"
he added, handing the cigarette over to me.</p>

<p>I stuck it in my pocket and again asked him to move on.</p>

<p>"Yes, move on," he said; "it's all very fine to say move
on, but I sh'ld like to know first where my house is.
Now where is my house?"</p>

<p>I knew that he lived opposite the stores, and pointed
out his house to him.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "that's my house? Funny my house
getting so big all of a sudden. Why, it's all over
windows&mdash;why's that, now tell me why d' I see so many
windows?"</p>

<p>"It's rather foggy, sir," I replied, "that is what makes
you think so. It is your house all right, and there are
only four windows to it."</p>

<p>"Contr'dict me," he said, "and you contr'dict your
superior officer. You will have four days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>,
you understan'-four days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> for contr'dicting
your superior officer. Now&mdash;just hold on to me."</p>

<p>I noticed that he was ready to collapse, and putting my
carbine against the wall I held him up. After a few
minutes his attack was over, and it evidently did him
good, for he seemed much steadier on his legs, and proceeded
to walk with some accuracy in the direction of his
house. He had just reached the middle of the road when
he stopped and called out to me, "Dragoon!" he said,
"you are a nice old Dragoon, and there's for you." Thereupon
he handed over to me a 50-centime piece, and then
reached the door of his house with my help. I suggested
his handing me over his key, and having opened the door
for him I stuck the key in his pocket and closed the door
upon him. Soon after the Corporal came to relieve me,
and I returned to the barracks.</p>

<p>When I reached the guard-room I went to the Sergeant's
room, and told him what had happened, but we both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
agreed that it would never do to report the matter, as it
never paid to "give away" an officer. I had to be once
more on sentry-go (from 4 to 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>), but I tipped one of
the troopers, who agreed to take my turn, and to remain
four hours instead of two at his post. At half-past twelve,
as I was disposing myself to lie down for a good sleep,
Captain des Tourelles turned up again. All the other
troopers were lying down, and I had just left the Sergeant's
office, so the Captain pounced on me. "Trooper," he
said, "catch hold of a lantern, I want to go for a round,"
and at the same time he shouted for the Sergeant and Corporal
of the Guard; noticing through the open door the
Sergeant, who had begun to doze with his head resting on
his arms. As soon, however, as the Captain called out
to him he jumped up and stood at "Attention."</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nom de Dieu de fainéant!</i>" ("You d&mdash;&mdash; lazy beast!")
he cried out in a drunken voice. "There, I catch you
asleep."</p>

<p>The Sergeant tried to excuse himself, but the Captain
told him to shut up.</p>

<p>"I am going with this Dragoon," he said, pointing
to me, "to see whether everything is in order, and if
everything is not in order <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je t'en ficherai de dormir</i>. Come
on," he added, turning to me, "walk in front of me."</p>

<p>I prepared to do so, and asked the Captain where he
wished to go.</p>

<p>"To the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant's</i> room, of course," he replied. "Why
do you stick the light of that lantern in my eyes? Come
on, walk alongside of me, and give me your arm: you
know that I am a father to all my Dragoons, and I don't
know where I have seen your face, but I like you&mdash;yes, I
like you," he went on repeating.</p>

<p>As we got to the staircase leading to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant's</i>
room the Captain stopped, and told me he was not going
up all those stairs, and he ordered me to go and rouse the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>, and to tell him that if he did not come sharp
he would be sorry for it. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>, who had been a
gendarme, and was an old soldier of many years' standing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
having only a few months to wait to get his pension,
cursed and swore when I explained matters to him. I
abstained from telling him that the Captain was drunk,
but he evidently knew the old fellow's failing, for he
muttered, as he got out of bed, "Drunk again, the old
beast!" I did not wait for him, but returned to the Captain.
I found him sitting at the bottom of the stairs
dropping off into a doze; but as soon as he heard my steps,
and saw the light of my lantern, he tried to get up, but
was quite unable to do so until I helped him. He looked
at me in a stupid way, and muttered, "What do you
want?" I reminded him that he had sent me to call the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>.</p>

<p>"The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>? Oh yes, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>. Why isn't he
here?"</p>

<p>"He is dressing, sir, and coming at once," I answered.</p>

<p>"Dressing?" he said. "What business has he to be
undressed? I'm not undressed."</p>

<p>Thereupon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>, who had donned his uniform
in a remarkably short time, came down the stairs.</p>

<p>He saluted, and said: "You have sent for me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Sent for you," slowly replied the Captain. "Oh yes&mdash;I
sent for you; why the devil didn't you come at once?"</p>

<p>"I was in bed, sir, and had to dress."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the Captain, "you had better go and
undress and get back to bed; I don't want you. I've got a
Dragoon, and I have got a lantern, and do you imagine that
I want any one to show me what is wrong? Don't stare
at me like that," he added. "Go to bed, I tell you."</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> saluted, and quietly returned to his room,
evidently well accustomed to such scenes.</p>

<p>"Come on, my Dragoon," said the Captain, taking hold
of my arm, and dragging me towards the kitchen. When
we got to the door I told him where we were.</p>

<p>"That is just it," he says; "it's the kitchen I want to
see"; and as we stepped in, he slipped on the dirty floor,
and before I could stop him he was sitting down besmeared
with grease. He laughed, but the fall appeared to have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
him good, and to have partly recalled him to his senses.
I helped him to rise, and as he did so he turned to
me, and ordered me to light up the stove with my
lantern. "That's all right," he said, "I only wanted to see
in what state the cooks had left the kitchen. I'll give
them four days' cells to-morrow for having left their
floor in such a disgraceful condition. And now I'll go
home."</p>

<p>According to his orders I walked ahead, and, pulling
himself together, he followed me; he told me to lead him
as far as the gate of the infantry barracks, thus saving
himself a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</i> of at least 300 yards. When he got to
the gate he had so far recovered that he was able to order
the infantry Sergeant to open it for him, and he walked
straight out, the Sergeant never suspecting for a moment
the state he was in. I returned to the guard-room and
reported matters to the Sergeant, who asked me to keep
the matter quite dark for the sake of the honour of the
regiment.</p>

<p>I do not mean to suggest that the picture I have just
drawn is meant to represent the average French officer.
Captain des Tourelles was, like Lieutenant Pernot, whom
I have previously mentioned, one of those officers who
had gained their commission during the Franco-Prussian
War, and who but for an accident would never have held
the rank of an officer in the French cavalry. They were
therefore men of an exceptional class no longer to be
found in the French army. Most of the cavalry officers
nowadays are gentlemen, and this remark even applies
to the majority of those who have gained their commissions
through the ranks, since the examinations for the admission
of cavalry Sergeants to the school of Saumur can
only be passed by men who have received a superior
education, and, as I have already stated, the Cadets of the
St. Cyr who are allowed to serve in the cavalry are
selected from amongst the most able of the candidates. I
should not like to give so high a character to the French
infantry officers. From my personal experience, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
as from all I have heard, I should say that very few of
them are gentlemen. There are, of course, exceptions,
but, taken as a class, they are certainly below the average
British Sergeant in education, manners, and military
training. I am speaking here of the subalterns, as those
who reach a higher rank are either men belonging to the
middle classes, whose contact with gentlemen has improved
their manners, or men who belong to good families but
have been unable to secure the highest places as Cadets
at St. Cyr.</p>

<p>Such, then, was my experience of the first guard I took.
Twenty-four hours on duty seems a long time, but, after
all, troopers enjoy a great deal of rest between the
intervals of sentry-go, and "Taking the guard" is really
more of a hardship to Sergeants and Corporals than to the
troopers themselves. Where it becomes a real burden is
in Paris, or other great towns where the various regiments
have to supply a considerable number of men for different
guards, so that the Sergeants may be called upon to take
the guard as often as twice a week, and even the troopers
cannot expect more than a week's immunity.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> The picture he drew of the average Sergeant was not an inviting
one, but all he told me was quite in accord with the description given
in a book published later on&mdash;"Sous-Offs," by Lucien Descares.
This book was written by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> who had served at Evreux in the
Duc de Chartres' regiment, both under the Duke himself and under the
Colonel who had replaced the former when he was expelled from the
French army. The latter officer was so furious with the work when it
appeared that he ordered it to be burnt on a dung-hill, and promised
thirty days in prison to any trooper found reading it. The book presents
a vivid picture of the life of sergeants in a cavalry regiment; but
to appreciate it the reader must have served in the French army himself,
as it teems with military slang; I may add that the details given
are so gross that its pages cannot be perused without disgust.</p></div></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>


<p>In June we began "squadron school," and were drilled on
the man&oelig;uvring ground with our respective squadrons. It
was only then that all the officers attended the drill, for the
training of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i> had been left almost entirely to the
Sergeants. By this time we might be regarded as trained
troopers, and, indeed, in time of war the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> would
have been quite fit to act as Sergeants, although it did not
seem to be the aim of the French military authorities to
use the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> as such, in the reserve, in case of war.
All the reserve men had their own Sergeants already, and
it was therefore difficult to understand why so much of
our time was wasted in giving us a military education
far superior to that of the average non-commissioned
officer.</p>

<p>Since we had begun to see less of Sergeant Legros I
had not been incessantly punished as I had been when we
were constantly under his orders, and I almost dared to
hope that I should be able to finish my time without getting
further acquainted with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>. However, it
was not so to be. One Sunday morning at six o'clock a
Corporal, who was on weekly duty, came to me and asked
me to let him have five francs, adding that if I gave him
the money he would not send me down to clean the stables.
I gave him the money, but half an hour later he came and
asked me for more. He had no time to press me hard,
as he was called away by the Sergeant, but, as soon as the
latter had done with him, he came back just as I was going
down to stables. He was already drunk, and said he
wanted another five francs. I absolutely declined to give
him the money, pointing out that as he was on duty that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
day he would be severely punished for getting drunk, and
I might also get punished for having supplied him with
money. This put him in a frightful rage, and he asked me
if I took him for a fool. I told him that it didn't matter
whether I took him for a fool or not, but that he knew
perfectly well that he made a fool of himself when he was
drunk.</p>

<p>"All right," he said; "you will have two days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de
Police</i> for having called me a fool. By the way," he added,
"Lemaire is sick, and you will have to take the guard for
him."</p>

<p>I remonstrated, explaining that I had taken the guard
the previous week, and that it could not therefore be my
turn to take the guard, even to replace a sick man.</p>

<p>"You refuse to obey the orders of the Corporals?"</p>

<p>"Of course I don't refuse," I said, knowing well that in
his state of mind he might, upon the least provocation,
report me as having refused to obey orders, and this would
have meant a court-martial, and most likely a sentence of
several years' hard labour.</p>

<p>"Well, get ready then," said the Corporal.</p>

<p>"I want to go and talk to the Sergeant-major first," I
replied.</p>

<p>"No you don't," he said, standing in front of me.</p>

<p>Of course I could not lay hands on him, for, as I have
already explained, the slightest assault on any man holding
a rank superior to one's own was invariably punished with
<i>death</i>. I therefore proceeded to get my things ready, well
knowing, however, that it was physically impossible for me
to get my kit into proper order for parade upon so short a
notice. Soon after, the Corporal having reeled away, I
went to the Sergeant-major's room, but there I found only
his orderly, who told me to my utter dismay that the
Sergeant-major had gone the previous evening on twenty-four
hours' leave. I therefore walked down to the stables in
order to find the Sergeant of the Week. On my way,
however, I fell foul of the Corporal, who asked me where
I was going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to speak to the Sergeant of the Week," I
said.</p>

<p>"No you don't," he replied; "you just walk back with
me."</p>

<p>"I am going to the Sergeant of the Week," I repeated.</p>

<p>"You refuse to obey orders then?" asked the Corporal.</p>

<p>"No, but I am going to the Sergeant of the Week."</p>

<p>"By God," he said, "if you don't follow me to the room
at once I will go straight to the Captain of the Week and
report you for having refused to obey orders."</p>

<p>Of course I had no alternative but to follow the Corporal,
and I had to dress anyhow in order to be ready in time for
the parade of the guard. The leather tops of my trousers
were not properly polished, my sword and carbine were
not spick and span as they ought to have been for parade,
and the brass work of my helmet was a trifle tarnished,
for it had not been cleaned since the previous afternoon.
As it was, I had to run to join the other troopers on parade,
and when I got there the command "Attention" had
already been given. Captain des Tourelles was Captain
of the Week, and the moment he caught sight of me he
ordered me to come to him.</p>

<p>"You are late," he said.</p>

<p>"Captain," I replied, "the reason of it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" he interrupted; "don't answer me&mdash;you are
filthy, you dirty beast!" He then began to examine my
buttons, my sword, my helmet, my carbine, muttering the
whole time, "Swine, swine. You are a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>, I think,
and you come here late, and as filthy as a pig! You shall
have four days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;sir&mdash;&mdash;" I ejaculated.</p>

<p>"You dare answer me! You shall have four days
more. Step back into the ranks!"</p>

<p>After we had been paraded and dismissed to the guardroom,
I went to the Sergeant of the Guard to explain my
case. This man was of low extraction, a peasant, in fact,
who had been promoted to the rank of Sergeant merely on
account of his undoubted severity. (He had once sent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
man before the court-martial for refusing to obey him, and
the poor trooper was sentenced to two years' hard labour.)
This would seem to constitute a poor qualification for promotion,
but, in many French regiments, it is notorious that
a Corporal who sends a man before a court-martial is
almost certain to be rewarded for his harshness. The
Sergeant took very little interest in what I told him, and
said it was no business of his, and that I had better speak to
the Sergeant-major about it. The following day, when I
left the guard, I went to see my Sergeant-major, but, unfortunately
for me, he had obtained a two days' extension of
leave, and the Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i>, who was acting in his
stead, told me that my punishment had already appeared
on the report, and had been forwarded to the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Very well then," I said, losing my temper, "I shall go
and complain to the Colonel," and I asked him to transmit
my application to see that officer. He strongly urged me
not to do so, assuring me that I should get no redress,
but I was obstinate, and my demand was duly forwarded
through the usual channels.</p>

<p>At noon the Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i> showed me a copy of the
Colonel's orders for the day. "You have got it pretty
hot," he said, and he showed me the passage of the
Colonel's decision referring to my case. To my dismay I
read the following:</p>

<p>"The punishments inflicted on Trooper Decle by
Corporal Armand and by Captain des Tourelles are
altered to twenty days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>."</p>

<p>I had, therefore, to sleep in the cells that night, and the
Sergeant told me that the answer to my application to see
the Colonel would probably appear in the following day's
regimental orders. I did not see Sergeant Legros until
the following day, for, as I have explained before, troopers
who have taken the guard are exempt from duty for four
and twenty hours. The next morning, however, when we
went to schoolroom, Legros called me.</p>

<p>"So you have been at your tricks once more, eh,
Decle?" he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>I told him exactly what had occurred, but he only
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Serves you right!" he said. "You <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> get
into the habit of throwing your money right and left, and
if you hadn't begun by tipping the Corporal all this
wouldn't have happened."</p>

<p>In the regimental orders of the day the Colonel stated
that the application of Trooper Decle to see him was
granted, and that the said Trooper Decle would have to
be at his house at 1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the next day. I therefore got
Titi and my other orderly to clean my clothes and my
equipment with the utmost care, and at one o'clock sharp
I proceeded to the Colonel's house. I was received by
one of his orderlies, who took me to the kitchen. He
went to inform the Colonel that I was there, and returned
saying that the Colonel had sent word that I must wait.
The cook very graciously offered me a cup of coffee, and
during the good three-quarters of an hour that I had to
wait she related to me the details of her family history,
telling me that she had already saved £20, which would
make a nice little dowry when she got married, and also
suggesting that I should take her out for a walk next
Sunday. (I could only politely express my regret at being
unable to do this, as I was undergoing punishment.) She
further told me that she did not care much for her place,
as "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Colonelle</i>"<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> was too close-fisted, and there was not
enough <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grattage</i> (perquisites) in the place. At the end of
three-quarters of an hour the Colonel's orderly told me to
walk upstairs, and showed me into a study where the
Colonel was writing at a desk, in regimental trousers, a
pair of slippers, and a black alpaca coat. He did not turn
round, and I stood, helmet in hand, near the door. I had
quite forgotten the regulations, and, finding myself in
polite society, I had instinctively uncovered. Just as I
remembered that I ought to keep my helmet on, and was
replacing it, the Colonel, hearing me move, turned his
head round.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>"What are you fiddling about with your helmet for?"
he asked. "Stand still, will you?" and he went on
writing. Ten minutes later he ordered me to come
forward. I saluted and stood at attention.</p>

<p>"Take off your helmet," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>I took it off.</p>

<p>"Your hair is too long, you will have to get it cut; and
you will soon get a court-martial if you go on like that.
Put on your helmet. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Sir," I began, "I have been punished&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Punished!" he exclaimed. "Yes, you are always
punished. You are the worst trooper in my regiment.
We don't want men like you in the French army. What
do you want?"</p>

<p>"Sir," I once more began, "I have been punished by
Corporal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it," he replied, waxing quite angry. "I told
you so before, you are always punished&mdash;always punished.
If it is to tell me that you have come here, you might
have stopped at the barracks. Why the deuce don't you
tell me what you want? Do you think I am standing
here at your orders?"</p>

<p>"If you will allow me to explain, sir," I replied, "I will
tell you why and how I have been punished."</p>

<p>"I don't want to know anything about it," said the
Colonel, in an angry voice. "Let me see, how many
days have you got?"</p>

<p>"Twenty days, sir," I said.</p>

<p>"Have you finished your punishment?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I have only done two days so far."</p>

<p>"And you dare to come and complain to me! But I
ought not to be astonished&mdash;for cool cheek and impudence
you haven't your equal. Go back to barracks and tell the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> to put you down ten days more for having made
an unjustified complaint. That's all&mdash;look sharp!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>I saluted, and as I was walking towards the door
the Colonel added: "I will teach you not to come and
bother me in future." On my way to barracks I thought
of the advice the Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i> had given me, and I
felt distinctly sorry that I had not followed it.</p>

<p>At the end of ten days I began to be so exhausted by
sleepless nights and the hard physical work we had now
to do that I began to feel seriously ill. I also had a
relapse of sore throat accompanied with fever, undoubtedly
due to all lack of sanitary precautions in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de
Police</i>. Since the warm weather had come, to the other
horrors of the place another was added. Fleas and lice
came through the boards by thousands, and our rooms
were infested with vermin. I went to the medical visit,
and the doctor found me so seriously ill that he had to
send me to the hospital, promising at the same time that
he would do his best to try and get me invalided. A
fortnight later he proposed me for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">invalidation</i>, but the
Special Commission before whom I was examined
refused to invalid me, but consented to allow me two
months' sick leave. I was kept a week longer in hospital,
and at the end of that time left the regiment for two
months. This interval of respite I spent in Switzerland,
where I did a good deal of mountain climbing.</p>

<p>I can hardly describe my feelings when I had to return
to my regiment and to go back to slavery. When I rejoined
my corps I found but a few men in barracks, as the
regiment was away at the man&oelig;uvres. The fifth squadron
alone, which forms the depôt, was left in barracks, and
there also remained a few troopers in each squadron,
mostly sick men, who were to look after the chargers
which had been left behind as unfit for hard work in the
field. I tried my best to get permission to join my
regiment, but this was not granted me; on the other
hand, the Major in command of the depôt, who was acting
as Colonel in the absence of the regiment, selected me to
train some of the young horses which had proved refractory.
This is the only good time I had as a trooper. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
was particularly fond of the work, being allowed to ride
whenever I liked, and having permission to use my own
hunting-saddle. I had six horses to train, so that I was
in the saddle almost the whole day, and had no one to
bully me.</p>

<p>When the regiment returned, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were once
more put together, and prepared for their final examination,
which was to take place in the middle of October.
On their return from the man&oelig;uvres the troopers who
had completed their five years' service left for their
homes amidst great rejoicings. Shortly after the departure
of the time-expired men (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la classe</i>) a good many
of those who had remained behind broke away from
the regiment, but most of them returned before the
expiration of six days, the law being that after six days'
time a trooper absent without leave becomes a deserter,
and is tried by court-martial, the sentence passed on him
ranging from one to three years' hard labour. Those who
absented themselves for less than six days were punished
with fifteen days' prison by the Colonel, but after some
time so many troopers absconded in that way, that, in
order to put a stop to the practice, the Colonel promised
that any man absenting himself without leave in future
would get thirty days' prison, and that all the troopers
belonging to his company would be confined to barracks
for thirty days also. Notwithstanding this, one trooper,
who had twice absconded within the last four months, ran
away once more, and the troopers of his company were
duly consigned to barracks during thirty days. When
the fellow returned at the end of the fifth day, his comrades,
infuriated by the punishment they had received
through his misconduct, determined to punish him on
their own account, and the Lieutenant in command of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>, when he heard of this, secretly consented to the
plan. When the trooper returned, the Lieutenant ordered
that before he was taken to prison he was to be sent to
the room "to change his clothes." The moment he
entered he was seized by the other troopers, tied face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
downwards on to a table, and every one of the twenty-four
troopers of the company filed past him, each one
dealing him a sharp blow with the buckle end of his
charger's girth. He was then untied, and led to the
riding-school, where a blanket was in readiness. In this
blanket were placed sundry wooden clogs, besides platters
and a scabbard or two. The blanket was then held all
round by the defaulter's comrades, and he was chucked
into it, and sent flying high up into the air perhaps a dozen
times. I witnessed the punishment, and wondered how
the poor fellow, after being sent flying more than fifteen
feet into the air, and then dropping amidst a shower of
scabbards, clogs, and platters, back into the blanket, was
not killed outright. When the punishment had come to
an end the trooper was marched to the prison, or, rather,
supported thither. On the way he met his Lieutenant and
complained bitterly of the treatment he had received, but
the officer merely told him that he had fully deserved all
he had got. The following day he was so bruised and
shaken that he could not rise, and he asked for a doctor.
The latter went to see him, but declined to do anything
for him, merely relieving him from punishment drill during
the next couple of days.</p>

<p>At that time there were from twelve to fourteen troopers
in prison, so that a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton de chasse</i> (punishment company)
was organised, under the orders of a certain Sergeant
de Cormet, who enjoyed the reputation of being the most
severe Sergeant of the whole regiment. An episode which
occurred during the previous winter may be quoted as an
example of his method. It was bitterly cold, and he was
drilling the prisoners, making them do the sword exercise
and keeping the troopers for five or ten minutes in the
same position. He had ordered the second position of
the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de sabre vers la droite</i>," which consists in holding
the sword extended to the right at arm's length; at the
end of a few minutes the troopers became so tired that
none of them were able to hold their bodies straight, and
had to put their left shoulders down, and let the points of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
their swords drop. De Cormet, as usual, walked behind
them, coolly saying, "Trooper Gabier, four days more for
not holding yourself straight; Trooper Chirac, your
sword is not straight, you will have two days more," and
so on. All of a sudden one of the prisoners, a poor weak
fellow, said to him:</p>

<p>"Sergeant, my hands are frozen; will you allow me to
blow in them for one minute? I can't hold my sword any
longer."</p>

<p>"Four days for speaking in the ranks," answered
Cormet, in his monotonous voice.</p>

<p>The trooper's fingers were as white as wax, and he soon
repeated his request with a similar result. At last, unable
to stand the pain any longer, the trooper put his sword
under his arm and blew on his fingers.</p>

<p>"Hold your sword in position at once," said the
Sergeant; "I shall report you to the Colonel."</p>

<p>"But, Sergeant, I can't," cried the trooper.</p>

<p>"You refuse to obey?" said the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"I can't, I can't," said the trooper, sobbing with pain,
and at the same time trying to grasp his sword, but finding
himself unable to close his benumbed fingers.</p>

<p>Again the Sergeant ordered him to hold his sword out,
but the man burst into tears, and once more sobbed, "I
can't, I can't!" Thereupon the Sergeant commanded
another prisoner to carry the sword, and calling out to
one of the troopers on guard, ordered him to fetch the
Corporal, and when the latter came he had the poor fellow
conveyed to the cells, and reported him for refusal to obey
orders. The trooper was therefore tried by court-martial,
and sentenced to <i>two years' hard labour</i>! I little dreamt
at the time that the day would come when, as will be seen
presently, I would have the misfortune to be placed in the
power of this fiend.</p>

<p>As the day fixed for our final examination approached
we were all busy looking through our various books in
order to be well up to the subjects in which we were to
be examined. Our Sergeant chiefly made us practise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
give the word of command; and when one of us was
placed in command of the company, he had, before ordering
any movement, to explain fully the way in which
such movement ought to be executed. In fact, we were
taught to act as Sergeants. At last the great day came.
The subjects on which we were to be examined were
these:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Dismounted drill, and command.<br />
Hippology.<br />
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voltige.</i><br />
Gymnastics.<br />
Topography.<br />
Knowledge of regulations in barracks and in the field.<br />
Riding.<br />
Mounted drill, and command.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The maximum number of marks which could be gained
for each subject was twenty. We were examined by a
Board of Officers, consisting of a Major, the Captain
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">instructeur</i>, our own Captain, and one Lieutenant. The
order in which we were called was settled according to
the numbers under which we had been enrolled, so that I
came third on the list of troopers; the three <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>
who had been made Corporals coming of course before the
others. The first subject on which we were examined
was dismounted drill. (The Corporals could select their
own subject, so that their examination was merely nominal.)
The two <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> who were examined before me were
told to explain the mere rudiments of the subject, but
when my turn came I was ordered to explain and command
the most difficult man&oelig;uvres. I did this with credit
to myself, and I was further ordered to command sword
drill; this I also did well, and I was then sent back to the
ranks. With the exception of three or four of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>,
who bungled most frightfully in explaining the
simplest movements, all of us knew our work thoroughly
well. We were then taken to the riding-school and examined
on Hippology; only four or five of us knew
anything about this, and d'Alvarez, who was a Corporal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
knew so little about the subject that the Lieutenant had
to prompt all his answers.</p>

<p>We were then dismissed for breakfast, and were told to
return at eleven o'clock to the riding-school to be examined
on <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltige</i> and gymnastics. We were hardly given a
chance to show what we could do, however, as the officers
were anxious to go and have luncheon. When they returned
at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> we were taken to the schoolroom, where
our proficiency in topography was put to the test. I have
never seen anything more ridiculous than this part of the
examination, for with the exception of the Captain
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">instructeur</i>, the officers seemed to know very little about
the subject, and most of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> knew still less.
We were closely examined on all questions dealing with the
duties of Sergeants and Corporals, in barracks and in the
field, and, although the officers who examined us tried
their best to put me wrong, I showed myself quite proficient,
which evidently disconcerted the officers, as I
heard them whispering, "We must give him good marks,
but it's a nuisance, you know."</p>

<p>"We shall find a way," replied my Captain. I did not
realise then what this meant, but I understood it quite
soon enough.</p>

<p>This part of the examination over, we were dismissed
for the day, and ordered to be ready for mounted drill,
with full kit, the next morning at 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> At the appointed
time, the officers who had examined us the previous day
turned up at the barracks, and accompanied by a trumpeter
we started for the man&oelig;uvring ground.</p>

<p>We had first to ride individually at various paces, and
were then ordered to go over the jumps. Very little
notice was taken of our riding, and while this went on
the officers chatted together, hardly bestowing a glance
on us.</p>

<p>After this we had, each in turn, to take command of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>, and to explain and command various evolutions
according to the officer's orders. I was successful in all
the various man&oelig;uvres I was ordered to command; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
many of the others made a sad mess of it, especially when
they had to wheel their company round, take it at a gallop
to a certain point, and then return so as to march past in
fours before the Major. Miscalculation of distances was
the commonest source of error. The examination over,
we were marched back to barracks, and in the evening my
Sergeant-major told me that he had seen the marks, and
that I was among the first half. I expressed my delight,
but he said warmly:</p>

<p>"Don't crow yet, my boy; they mean to keep you a
second year, and they will find a way to do it."</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck, for I never thought, for an instant,
of such a contingency. I told the Sergeant-major that it
would be monstrous, considering that I had proved my
proficiency.</p>

<p>"Take my warning," he said, "and don't be astonished
if they keep you another year."</p>

<p>De Lanoy, to whom I went, then said that he did not
think that the Colonel could possibly keep me, as he would
have to keep a good many others who were below me in
proficiency if he did so.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with a beating heart that, on the
following day, I stood on parade, awaiting the result of
the examination, which was to be proclaimed to us by
our Captain, who had prepared a little speech for the
occasion.</p>

<p>"I have to congratulate you," he said, "on your proficiency,
which is due to the untiring efforts of Sergeant
Legros, whom I hope soon to see duly rewarded. With
the exception of two or three of you, I have never had a
better or more intelligent set of troopers under my orders.
Now I will, before reading out to you the result of
the examination, explain how it has been arrived
at. The maximum of marks allotted for each subject is
twenty, and the number of marks gained by each candidate
is multiplied by a coefficient fixed according to the
relative importance of the subject." He then read out to
us the various coefficients (which will be found farther on).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
"In your previous examinations," he went on, "we did
not reckon good conduct, but this being a final examination,
and the submission of each trooper to discipline
being a matter of such paramount importance, the Colonel
has decided to give it due prominence, and has, therefore
fixed the coefficient at the figure of fifty, which makes
altogether the maximum number of marks to be gained
2000. I am glad to add that many of you have obtained
more than three-quarters of the possible number of marks,
and this, I say once more, is entirely due to the efforts
of your able Sergeant."</p>

<p>The Captain then read out the list. At the head of it
stood the names of the three <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> who had been
previously appointed Corporals, the first being d'Alvarez.
This made us smile, for, though we all liked him, we knew
perfectly well, that if it had not been for the influence of his
family, he would have ranked near the end of the list.
The two other Corporals had worked hard since their promotion,
and fully deserved their position. The Captain,
however, continued to read out name after name, and yet
mine had not been reached. I became more and more
alarmed, and I turned cold when it came at last, at the
very end of the list, with 633 marks only, while the man
before me, one of the most vulgar, ignorant, and stupid
fellows I ever met, had 1027. All the others looked at
me, and felt in their hearts that a gross injustice had been
committed.</p>

<p>I was aroused from my thoughts by the Captain's
voice:</p>

<p>"Decle," he said, "I am sorry to have to communicate
bad news to you; but the Colonel, after due consideration,
has decided that, having regard to the too small amount
of marks you have obtained&mdash;you see you are the only
one who has less than half of the possible maximum&mdash;the
Colonel, I repeat, has decided that you shall be kept
back to complete your military education. I am sorry for
you, but it cannot be helped. As to the others, those
who are already Corporals will be promoted to the rank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Sergeant, and the next three on the list are promoted to
the rank of Corporal."</p>

<p>Thereupon he dismissed us. I went to him, and begged
and implored him to ask the Colonel to reconsider his
decision, but he replied that I was merely wasting my
time and his.</p>

<p>The blow had fallen, and I felt like a madman! The
first thing I did was to obtain a copy of the list, which
was posted up in the schoolroom. I then saw how the
trick had been played. A few words of explanation will
make the device clear.</p>

<p>The result of the examination, so far as I was concerned,
was as follows:</p>

<p>The highest marks obtained out of a possible 1000
were 816, the lowest marks (given to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> next to
me on the list) were 177. By the actual marks obtained I
ought to have been classed the fifth out of fourteen, but
as the examiners were determined that I should be the
last on the list, the following plan was devised:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good conduct" was added to the other items, and a
coefficient of no less than fifty was allotted to it. With
the exception of two other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> besides myself,
twenty marks were given to every one for good conduct,
thus increasing their totals by <i>one thousand</i>! The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
who was last but one was given seventeen marks for
good conduct, and this, multiplied by fifty, made 850
to be added on to his beggarly 177, giving him a total of
1027 marks. I was given nothing for good conduct, so
that I remained with my original 633 marks, and was thus
classed last. The regulations stated that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, who
at the end of the year had failed to show a proficiency
sufficient to enable them to obtain a number of marks
at least equal to half the possible maximum at the final
examination might be detained for a second year&mdash;I was
therefore detained <i>according to the regulations</i>!</p>

<p>It was with an almost broken heart that I bade good-bye
to all my comrades, and when I watched the train
which took them away disappearing in the distance, I felt
like a marooned stowaway who watches the departing
ship sink below the horizon. When they had gone I
went to my room at the hotel, seriously debating whether
I should desert or else shoot myself. That I did neither
remains a source of wonder to me.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>


<p>I do not intend to enter into many of the details of my
second year's service, as this was a mere repetition of
what I had already gone through, and I will therefore
confine myself to a brief description of that portion of
my adventures which may offer some special points of
interest.</p>

<p>Some time elapsed before the arrival of the new
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, and during this period we had practically no
work to do with the exception of "stables." All the
Sergeants of my squadron, and many of those belonging
to other squadrons, had made friends with me, and they
all pitied me for the cruel position I was placed in.
Meanwhile the senior <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> retired with a pension, and
my Sergeant-major was appointed in his stead, while
Sergeant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i> Vaillant became Sergeant-major. Vaillant
was a particular friend of mine, so that with his help,
and the support I knew the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> would give me, I
hoped that if a decent Sergeant was put in charge of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> I should soon obtain my discharge. There
was no chance of our being entrusted again to the tender
mercies of Legros, as he had also been appointed
Sergeant-major.</p>

<p>A number of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were drafted into our regiment
that year&mdash;I believe there were nearly thirty of them.
Socially and intellectually they were very inferior to my
previous comrades. There never existed between them
that spirit of comradeship which was so great among the
little set to which I belonged. Shortly after their arrival
a trooper from the first squadron came to tell me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Sergeant de Cormet wanted to speak to me, and that I
was to go to his room at once. I could not imagine what
he wanted with me, as I did not belong to his squadron,
and I had never had anything to do with the man. I
went, however, and when I reached his room I asked him
whether it was true that he had sent for me.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I want to speak to you. I have just
heard that I am going to be put in charge of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>,
and as it appears that nobody has yet been able to
break you in, I merely wanted to warn you that I mean
to succeed. If ordinary means are not successful, I'll
stand no nonsense, and I'll find some way to get you
court-martialled. A few years in a gaol would do a lot
of good to a swine of your class."</p>

<p>I had so far made no reply, but stood with my arms
folded on my chest. My face must have expressed my
stifled anger, I suppose, for when I took two steps forward
the Sergeant retreated towards the window. "Don't be
afraid," I said, "I am not going to touch you&mdash;you are
not worth it; but now that you have told me what you
mean to do, I will also tell you what <i>I</i> mean to do.
Remember this&mdash;you may find a way to get me court-martialled,
though I doubt it, but if you do&mdash;when I come
out, be it in ten years', in fifteen years', or even twenty
years' time&mdash;I shall kill you."</p>

<p>"You dare to threaten me&mdash;me a Sergeant!" he said.</p>

<p>"Don't get my blood up; you had better not," I
replied; "remember that there are no witnesses here, and
if you rouse me I might cause you bodily harm. I am a
good deal stronger than you. But I think that this
conversation has lasted long enough, and I will only add
a few words to what I told you before. I warned you
what I would do if you got me court-martialled, but I
further warn you that if you bully me while I am under
your orders I will punish you when I am no longer a
soldier. And now that we quite understand each other I
will say 'Good afternoon,' only mind," I added, "if you
report me for what has taken place here I will deny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
everything; you have no means of proving your word,
and you would not have dared to tell me what you did in
presence of witnesses."</p>

<p>I returned to my room fairly heart-broken at the idea
that I was going to be under the orders of the most
cowardly brute in the whole regiment; I had seen the
fellow at work when he was drilling the prisoners, and I
knew that if I had had a bad time of it while I served under
Sergeant Legros, it would be ten times worse under
Sergeant de Cormet. Shortly afterwards the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>
and the recruits of the year arrived, and being a trooper
of a year's standing I was allotted a recruit to whom I
was supposed to teach his work. I almost despaired of
ever doing anything with the fellow, and in vain I tried
to prevent his being bullied, but the stupid chap seemed
to do all he could to invite it.</p>

<p>"I say, you chaps," he said to the troopers on his
arrival, "I am a Parisian, you know, and I am not going
to stand any nonsense. I have been in a grocer's shop,
and I am not a greenhorn. Besides, my cousin Beaujean
has been in a Dragoon regiment, and he has told me all
about it, so no bullying please, or else you will have to do
with Jossier&mdash;that's my name."</p>

<p>I need not say that after this little speech of his, Jossier
became the butt of all the practical jokers in the room. The
scenes I described at the beginning of this book were of
course once more renewed, but one of the jokes which
was played on my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bleu</i> (recruit) was quaint enough to be
related. He was in the habit of wearing at night a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnet
de coton</i>, similar to the head-gear which was given to us
at hospital, but much more bulky. When drawn out to its
full length it was fully two feet long, and when he had it
on his head the peak stood some eight inches above his
head, with an enormous tassel fixed on to it. One evening,
after he had gone to sleep, a practical joker set the tassel
alight, and being of cotton it began to burn merrily.
Nearly all the men in the room collected round his bed to
see the fun, and hearing a noise he sat up in bed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
looked at us in a bewildered way. By this time the tassel
was burnt down, and the other part of the head-gear was
smouldering away.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you are a nice lot of fools to stand
there staring round my bed like a lot of idiots. It's very
funny to look at a man, isn't it?"</p>

<p>We were all laughing, as he had not yet noticed that his
head-gear was on fire; but all of a sudden his speech was
interrupted, as he felt an uncomfortable heat near the
crown of his head, and having impulsively put his hand to
his head he realised what was the matter, and chucked
away his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnet de coton</i>.</p>

<p>"Ah, you swine," he exclaimed, "I'll teach you," and
he jumped out of his bed, making a dash for us. Unluckily
for him, the first man on whom he jumped was
Piatte, to whom he dealt a blow on the chest. Piatte caught
hold of him by the arms and legs, and shouted, laughing,
"I say, boys, I've caught a flea; let's make it jump!"
Immediately a blanket was produced, and the recruit tossed
up, and when they put him once more on his legs he did
not complain, but quietly sneaked into his bed.</p>

<p>During the fortnight which elapsed until the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>
were put together, I was told off by my Sergeant-major to
drill half a dozen recruits, and at the end of the week I
had already got more out of my recruits than any of the
Corporals who were in charge of the others. The method
I employed was to promise my men a bottle of wine if
they drilled well, and of course they all did their utmost
to gain that reward. Captain Hermann, who, as the reader
will remember, was in command of our squadron, and had
been in charge of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, was evidently pleased
with me, and actually came to congratulate me. This state
of affairs unfortunately lasted only for a fortnight, and at
the end of that time the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were formed into a
separate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i>, and on account of their number two officers
were placed in command of them&mdash;Captain Hermann
and Lieutenant Amy. Two Sergeants were also detached
for this service&mdash;Sergeant de Cormet and Sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Cordier. The latter was a personal friend of mine, and I
knew that he would counteract de Cormet's bad intentions
towards me. No Corporal had yet been selected by the
Colonel, and therefore when the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> were
assembled for the first time, I took my position to the
left of the company, the Corporal's place, which, by rights
belonged to me as the senior trooper. The previous year
when we were formed into a separate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i> there was among
us a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> who had been detained and who belonged
to the lot who had served before us, and Legros had
always made him do Corporal's duty. But evidently de
Cormet did not mean to treat me in that way, for
he ordered me to take my place in the ranks among
the others, and he made me go through all the
rudiments of the instruction, as if I had been a raw
recruit. The other Sergeant treated me very differently,
and when he took the service the following day he ordered
me to act as Corporal. Lieutenant Amy, however, turned
up in the middle of the drill and sharply reprimanded the
Sergeant, ordering that I should be put through the
rudiments of the drill absolutely as if I had been a raw
recruit. To make things worse Sergeant Cordier was
taken with typhoid fever a few days after he took charge
of us, and having had a relapse during his convalescence
he was sent home on six months' sick-leave.</p>

<p>Early in December two Corporals were appointed to
help de Cormet: one of them, Lormand, was a schoolfellow
of mine, who had enlisted three months before, and
had just been promoted to the rank of Corporal.</p>

<p>I had been doing work with the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i> for a
fortnight, and Sergeant de Cormet hadn't yet found it
possible to punish me, for Lieutenant Amy was always
present when we drilled, and de Cormet himself spent very
little time in the schoolroom, leaving one of the Corporals
in charge of it. As, however, the previous year's regulations
as to leave were still in force, de Cormet had always
refused to let me apply for leave. A few months before,
I had attained my majority, and at the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
December my solicitors wrote me a most urgent letter
pressing me to come to Paris without delay, to settle some
important matters. I showed this letter to de Cormet, but
he absolutely declined to grant me leave, and the Captain
to whom I then went was equally emphatic in his refusal,
adding that I should only get leave for the New Year provided
I was not punished in the interval. As it was most
necessary that I should go to Paris that week, I went to
see the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>, Bernard, my former Sergeant-major, and
asked him to let me go to Paris from Saturday afternoon
after "stables" until Monday morning. He at once promised
not to report me missing, and told me to go and
settle matters with my Sergeant-major. The latter readily
acquiesced, and suggested a plan which would enable me
to reach Paris before the offices were closed. "Stables"
being over at 4 o'clock, I could by catching the 4.30 train
reach Paris at 5.30, and as the offices do not close till
6 o'clock (Saturday half-holidays are unknown in France),
I should be in time to transact my business. My Sergeant-major,
however, remarked that if I wanted to catch
the 4.30 train I would have no time to go to the hotel to
change my regimentals for civilian attire, and therefore
suggested that I should dress in civilian clothes in his
room and leave barracks by the infantry gate. I had
made it a rule whenever I went to Paris without leave to
wear over my clothes a long blue blouse falling below the
knees, with a silk cap (the costume of the lower classes in
the North of France), and I also wore a false beard and
blue spectacles. I donned this attire in the Sergeant-major's
room, and in order that I should have no difficulty
at the gate he accompanied me there, and told the Sergeant
that I was a friend of his who was in a hurry to catch his
train, and I was thus allowed to pass. I reached the
station only just in time, and the train was already moving,
so that I had to jump into the carriage nearest at hand,
and received a severe shock at finding myself in company
with two officers of my regiment. Having a newspaper
in my pocket, however, I opened it, and held it in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
my face. My disguise was so good that the officers had
not recognised me when I jumped into the carriage, but I
was afraid that they might become suspicious if I held a
newspaper in front of my face during the whole journey.
I therefore got out of the carriage at the following station,
where I had just time to jump into a second-class compartment.
Here, to my astonishment, I found my schoolfellow,
Corporal Lormand, also in civilian attire; I knew that
he had no leave, and as we had been great chums at school,
I did not hesitate to remove my false beard and blue
spectacles, which were a great discomfort to me.</p>

<p>"Well I never!" exclaimed Lormand when he recognised
me. "Your disguise is so good," he added, "that I
should never have known you. But how is it that you are
going to Paris without leave?"</p>

<p>"I might put the same question to you," I replied, "as
we seem to be both in the same boat."</p>

<p>We chatted pleasantly until we reached Paris, where
we parted company&mdash;not, however, without having arranged
to lunch together the next day.</p>

<p>I returned to my garrison town by the last Sunday train
and found the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>, to whom I had wired, waiting for
me outside the barracks, so that I should walk in unquestioned.
He told me that everything was all right,
and that nobody had noticed my absence, so I went to
my Sergeant-major's room to change my clothes.</p>

<p>The next morning, as we were assembled for dismounted
drill, de Cormet called me to him.</p>

<p>"You went to Paris yesterday without leave," he said.</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant," I replied.</p>

<p>"I tell you that you went to Paris yesterday without
leave, and what's more, in civilian attire."</p>

<p>"You are making a mistake, Sergeant," I again said.</p>

<p>"Didn't you see Decle?" he then asked, turning to
Corporal Lormand.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant, I saw him," replied the latter.</p>

<p>"What have you to say to that?" asked de Cormet.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Sergeant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," he went on, "I will send you to the prison
at once"; and forthwith he had me marched off by the
Corporal of the Guard.</p>

<p>I need not say that Sergeant de Cormet had absolutely
no right to send me to prison, but knowing that the
Captain would always endorse whatever he did, he never
hesitated to give us punishments far in excess of those he
was entitled to inflict. At breakfast time, after he had
dismissed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, he came to the prison, where he
found me alone.</p>

<p>"Now I have come to speak to you, Decle," he said.
"I have not yet reported the matter either to the Lieutenant
or to the Captain, and if you will tell me the truth I
promise you that you shall not be punished. I am fully
aware that you went to Paris in civilian attire, with leave
from your Sergeant-major, and I believe with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant's</i>
knowledge, but we shall leave the latter out of the question.
Now if you will make a declaration in the presence of the
Captain and another witness, saying that you have been
to Paris with leave from your Sergeant-major, you shall
not be punished."</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to think over your offer, Sergeant?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "I will release you now, and give you
till eleven o'clock to make up your mind. You will then
come to my room and tell me what you have decided."</p>

<p>I was accordingly let out of prison, and pretended to go
to my room, but the moment de Cormet had disappeared,
I rushed to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudants</i> room and told him how matters
stood.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?" he asked me.</p>

<p>"You need not put such a question to me," I replied.
"You ought to know that I would rather get sixty days'
prison than give you and my Sergeant-major away; what
we must do," I added, "is to discuss the situation with
Sergeant-major Vaillant, so that he may be fully aware of
what I mean to say, and act accordingly. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>
despatched a trooper to call the Sergeant-major. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the latter turned up he was greatly concerned to hear
what had happened, but I assured him that he need have
no fear, and explained my plan to him. I would say that
I left barracks on the Saturday evening after arranging
my bed so that it appeared as if I were sleeping in it when
the Sergeant of the Week passed through the room to call
the evening roll. I would also say that the Sergeant-major
gave me leave not to attend stables on the Sunday
(which he had a perfect right to do), and that I returned
to barracks on Sunday night by getting over the wall. I
would also explain that I was not reported missing at the
Sunday evening roll-call, one of my comrades having prepared
my bed as I had on the previous night, so that the
Sergeant of the Week did not notice my absence. Sergeant-major
Vaillant remarked that if I told that story I should
be punished with special severity, but I said I did not
mind in the least so long as I did not get him into trouble."
He thanked me profusely. "In the state of mind the
Colonel is in," he added, "if he found out that I had given
you leave he would be certain to reduce me in rank."
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> remarked that de Cormet's motive was
plain, for being first on the list of the Sergeants proposed
for promotion to Sergeant-major's rank, he wanted to avail
himself of the chance of getting Vaillant reduced to secure
his place.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock sharp I went to de Cormet's room and
found him in the most amiable frame of mind.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I suppose that you have made up
your mind to tell the whole truth?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sergeant," I replied; "I see no good in
shrinking from it, and I will tell you exactly what happened."
I then told him the story I had concocted with
the Sergeant-major and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>.</p>

<p>"You are telling me lies," he angrily exclaimed. "I
can't understand your doing your best to get an exemplary
punishment when you can so easily get off scot-free.
Why don't you confess purely and simply that you had
your leave from your Sergeant-major?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will tell you why, Sergeant," I then replied, "and
the best of reasons is that I had not his leave, and as
there are no witnesses here, you can't use what I am
going to say against me. You want me to accuse my
Sergeant-major so as to get him reduced in rank, because
you hope to be appointed in his stead. None but a man
as mean as you are would try that sort of game. You
can do what you like, but I shall merely repeat what I
told you just now, and I once more want you to understand
that I had no leave whatever, and that my Sergeant-major
knew nothing about my going to Paris. Now do
your worst."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "I wanted to do you a good turn, and
that's how you take it. You will see what it will cost
you! I shall report the matter at once to the Captain."</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and in the afternoon the
Captain turned up at the barracks and sent for me.</p>

<p>"I thought some time ago, Decle," he said, "when you
were doing your work with the squadron, that you were
really trying to turn over a new leaf. I find, however,
that, on the contrary, you are doing your best to get yourself
sent to Biribi. What is the meaning of this story
that I hear from de Cormet about your having gone to
Paris in ridiculous civilian attire, and with the complicity
of your Sergeant-major? I have spoken to the latter,
who is naturally most indignant, and I am not sure
that I shall not have you court-martialled for having
basely made a false accusation against one of your
superiors."</p>

<p>"I have not accused my Sergeant-major, sir," I
indignantly replied, "though I was asked to do so by the
Sergeant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No further accusations!" interrupted the Captain
with severity.</p>

<p>"Sir," I continued, "I do not know what Sergeant de
Cormet may have told you; but, if you will allow me, I
will repeat to you what I told him, and freely confess all
that I have done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>I thereupon once more repeated the story we had concocted.</p>

<p>"But," cried the Captain, "Sergeant de Cormet distinctly
told me that you had tried to exculpate yourself by
asserting that you went to Paris with your Sergeant-major's
leave!"</p>

<p>"I swear to you upon my honour that I never said so,
sir!" I replied.</p>

<p>The Captain then sent for de Cormet, and told him that
I denied having tried to excuse myself by alleging that I
had permission from the Sergeant-major.</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell me," said de Cormet, "that you were
not reported missing on the Sunday because you had leave
from your Sergeant-major?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I replied; "I was excused by him from
attending stables, but I distinctly told you that I had no
other leave: you know it quite well, Sergeant, as you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," quickly interrupted de Cormet, addressing the
Captain, "I suppose, sir, that I misunderstood what Decle
told me."</p>

<p>"But didn't he tell you," replied the Captain, "how he
deceived the Sergeant of the Week by making a sham
figure in his bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I remember now," said de Cormet quietly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you were too kind to Decle," said the
Captain, "and that you wanted to save him from a severe
punishment, and it did not strike you that if I had found
out that Sergeant-major Vaillant had given him leave I
would unhesitatingly have asked the Colonel to reduce
him to the rank of Sergeant. As to Decle, I will begin
by giving him four days' prison, and I will draw up a
report at once, which you will take the Colonel."</p>

<p>I had to hand the whole of my kit to the Sergeant
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourrier</i>, and was then led to the prison. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i>
came to inform me, later on, that the Colonel had altered
my punishment to eight days' prison and eight days' cells
in solitary confinement. All punishments have to be accompanied
by an explanation, showing the reasons why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the punishment has been inflicted, and in all cases involving
prison the punishment has to be reported to the Major-general
in command of the brigade to which the regiment
belongs. Here are the reasons for my punishment as they
appeared in the Regimental Orders of the day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The trooper Decle," said the Colonel in the Regimental
Orders, "will be punished with eight days' prison, and
eight days' cells, for having infamously deceived the Sergeant
of the Week by making a dummy in his bed, for
having gone to Paris without leave in civilian clothes and
in disguise&mdash;and for having, notwithstanding the orders
previously issued, applied to his Sergeant-major for
leave not to attend stables instead of demanding such
leave from the Sergeant in charge of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>; for
having further deceived the Sergeant of the Week in
getting another trooper to make a dummy in his bed,
and for having returned to barracks over the wall. This
trooper is warned that unless he amends soon his conduct
the Colonel will be under the painful necessity of sending
him before a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de discipline</i>." (See p. <a href="#Page_29">29</a>.)</p>

<p>When the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> came to communicate this order to
me he promised that he would not let me be put in solitary
confinement, but that I should spend the fortnight over
which my punishment extended in the common prison.
He also promised to give orders that a steak should be
brought to me from the canteen and placed on the top of
my daily rations. He added that as he was being relieved
from duty that day he would recommend me to the other
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudants</i>, and that my punishment would begin with
prison, so that when he took "the week" again on the
next Monday he could see about arranging that I should
not be put in solitary confinement. The worst consequence
of the punishment I had just received was that it
prevented me from entertaining any hope of being released
from active military service after the first examination of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, and I knew that in future I should be
treated still more harshly than before.</p>

<p>I was chiefly indignant with Corporal Lormand. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
think that a schoolfellow of mine, who professed to be
my friend, who had accepted luncheon from me the
previous day, could have been mean enough to denounce
me! To think that, although he had gone to Paris
without leave, in civilian attire, like myself, he was not
punished, but congratulated by the Captain for having
"given me away"! All this made me ask myself
whether such a thing as common justice existed in the
French army.</p>

<p>I have seen a great deal of the world since. Years
have elapsed since all this happened, but from all I have
heard from young fellows who have served their time but
recently, the system is still just the same. The bullying
of privates by Corporals and Sergeants is as bad as in my
time, the officers are jealous of each other, and, instead
of encouraging privates so as to make them love their
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</i>, they plot and scheme to get promotion, while the
Corporals and Sergeants chiefly strive to find or manufacture
defaulters, well knowing that by so doing they will
attract their chiefs' attention, and thus get advancement.</p>

<p>When I was sent to prison there were four other
troopers undergoing a similar punishment, but I did not
see anything of them until the call for "Soup," as they
were kept out all day on fatigue duty and punishment
drill. Before they returned the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adjudant</i> came again to
see me, and advised me to go to the medical visit the
following morning. He told me that he had seen the
doctor, and laid my case before him, and that the doctor
had promised to exempt me from punishment drill and
from fatigue duty. He sent me, too, at my request,
some paper and ink, and all the books we had to study
for our examinations. I had also smuggled into the
prison Conway's admirable little guide-book to the
highest peaks of the chain of Monte Rosa, which I meant
to translate into French to while away the time. I also
went with the Corporal of the Guard to fetch a straw
mattress and a blanket, to which, as previously explained,
a prisoner is entitled. In the evening I asked
the Corporal of the Guard to put my name down for the
medical visit of the next morning.</p>

<p>When the other prisoners returned for their dinner,
they were much astonished to find a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i> as their
companion. Most of them were undergoing prison for
having <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tiré une bordée</i> (having been absent without leave
during five days, and having remained away up to the
very last limit they could reach without being proclaimed
deserters). These men were thoroughly bad characters,
and very different from Titi and Piatte, who were mere
dare-devils; for Titi himself, though he had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
prison several times before he joined the regiment, had
never been convicted for anything worse than street
broils. The awful life of immorality he had led before
coming to the regiment was due chiefly to the surroundings
among which he had been brought up, but notwithstanding
his failings, the fellow would never have committed
a theft, and I would not have hesitated to trust
him with any amount of money. My present prison
companions, however, were of a very different type.
None of them, it is true, had been convicted before
joining the army, but I soon gathered from their conversation
that it was through sheer luck that they had
escaped so far. Of course, as I was a common trooper
like them, and in prison, they spoke quite openly of their
past life before me, and even bragged of their misdeeds
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour m'épater</i>. One of them, the fellow who had received
so severe a punishment from his comrades when he was
thrashed and tossed in a blanket in the riding-school, had
never ceased to speak of the treatment he had received,
and he used to swear that if, when his time was out, he
ever came across one of his assailants, he would put a
knife into him.</p>

<p>While we were eating our food he returned once
more to the subject, and when I told him not to
brag so much about what he would do, he got quite
indignant.</p>

<p>"You don't believe me, old chap," he exclaimed;
"why, don't imagine that it would be the first time!
Many are the times when I have <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chouriné</i> (stabbed) a
bloke. Me and two others we were for a long time in
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les boulevards extérieurs</i> (a part of Paris which at that
time was still most dangerous), and a pretty good haul
we sometimes made. I remember once an old woman
was going home late at night&mdash;we knew her well&mdash;she
owned a good lot of property, and she had been to collect
her rents that day. One of us followed her the whole
day, and in the evening he came to tell us that she had
gone to dinner with her daughter. You bet, we kept a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
look-out for her. At ten o'clock, sure enough, there she
comes. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergots</i> had just turned up a side-street to
make their rounds, and we knew that the coast would be
clear for at least a quarter of an hour. We hid in a
doorway, and as she passed us Bibi le Mufle jumps on
her from behind, while the other chap who was with me
lands her one in the mouth. We laid her on the ground,
and I was searching her pocket when she begins to kick
up the devil's own row, and shouts 'Murder! Police!'
I couldn't find anything in her pockets, and just then a
bloke who had heard her giving tongue comes along, and
he begins shouting 'Police! Murder!' 'Oh,' I says,
'I'll soon give him "Murder."' What does a bloke deserve
who comes and interferes with gentlemen at their
business? So I rush at him and I soon stopped his
howling with a jab from my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eustace</i> (slang word used
for big knife). The others, who were busy searching the
old woman, never noticed the police who had come round,
and although I shouted to warn them that '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les pantes</i>' (the
police) were coming, they couldn't make tracks in time.
Bibi le Mufle tried to run away, but unfortunately he
fell over my bloke, and they collared him there. They
accused him of having done for the chap, but he swore
that it wasn't true. The old woman recovered, and so
did the bloke, and you'd never guess what that man did.
He swore that it was Bibi le Mufle who had stabbed
him. And the old woman, who was stupid-like when
she recovered, swore that only two chaps had attacked
her. The others behaved like bricks, they never gave
me away, and so I got up a collection to get them
a good counsel, and they only got three years; so
you see, old chap, I am not afraid to use my knife,
and I swear to God that some day or other I'll have
the life of one of them chaps who knocked me about
as they have, and, what's more, he concluded, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">j'en ai
soupé du régiment</i> (I am sick of the regiment), and I
mean to make a clean bolt of it the moment I get out of
prison."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that my prison companions were not
very desirable acquaintances.</p>

<p>When I went to the medical visit the following
morning, the doctor took me apart, and asked me to tell
him exactly what I had done to be treated with such
extreme severity. I began to tell him the same story as
I had told my Captain, but he stopped me.</p>

<p>"I know," he said, "that you are humbugging me. I
heard part of the truth from your Sergeant-major, and
you may trust to my word that whatever you tell me will
go no further."</p>

<p>I therefore told him exactly what had happened, and
the part Sergeant de Cormet had played.</p>

<p>The doctor replied that it looked as if my Sergeant
meant to drive me to do something desperate, and he
added that he was determined to put a stop to it. He
had already given special orders excusing me from
fatigue duty and punishment drill, and at my request he
also ordered that an extra blanket should be given me.
He added that he was disgusted at the way in which I
was being treated, that my constitution was being ruined
by the harsh treatment I was subjected to, and that he
considered that I was unfit for service under such
conditions.</p>

<p>When I returned to prison my fellow prisoners were
doing punishment drill in the barrack-yard, and I felt
glad to be rid of their company for the time being. I
was busy all day translating Conway's book, and the time
passed almost pleasantly, as I had at least nobody to
bully me. The following day was Sunday, and my fellow
prisoners were only taken out in the morning, so that
their society was inflicted upon me the whole day.
De Lanoy, who was on guard that day, came to pay
me a visit, and took me into the corridor leading into
the prison to have a chat with me. I heard some
startling news from him&mdash;how two Sergeants who had
just re-enlisted and received their premium of £24 had
deserted, as also had two or three troopers. He brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
me a novel, and advised me to cut off the strings of the
binding and to hide the bulk of it inside a loaf of bread,
keeping out only a dozen pages at a time, so that in case
the Captain of the Week should visit the prison I could
hide these pages inside my shirt, and should they be
discovered by the officer I could say that it was waste
paper. His advice proved excellent, as that very afternoon
the Major came to visit the prison. He inquired
what all the books I had were, and I replied that they
were the regulation books we had to study, and that
I had been allowed to bring them into prison so as not
to waste my time. I had carefully hidden in a dark
corner Conway's little book and inserted the pages
of my translation into my blotting-pad, so that I was
not found out. The Major felt me all over, and made
me produce the paper inside my shirt, but seeing
only a few loose leaves he did not take any more notice
of it.</p>

<p>During the night Piatte and Titi were marched into
the place. When the door had been closed upon them
a candle was lit, and Titi embraced me with transports
of joy, being evidently in high spirits.</p>

<p>"Ah, what fun, old fellow!" he cried out. "It's too
funny, you know."</p>

<p>"What have you been up to again?" I asked.</p>

<p>Piatte, who was also roaring with laughter, said, "I'll
show you." He was in full uniform, and proceeded to
take off his tunic, an example which was followed by
Titi. When they had removed their garments I saw
to my amazement that they were both dressed in acrobatic
fleshings!</p>

<p>I could not help laughing, and asked what on earth it
meant.</p>

<p>"Well," said Titi, "we both got midnight leave, and
as a fair was going on we thought we would go and have
a look round. We soon came across a big tent. 'Twas
the wrestlers' place, and so I says to Piatte, 'Let's go in.'
It only cost 50 centimes for the first rows, and in we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
went. They were not a grand lot, you know, these
chaps, and Piatte says to me, 'Why, I could knock any
one of them down with one hand.' 'Oh,' I says, 'I
don't say that I would do it with one hand, but I would
jolly well manage to bowl over any one of the boiling.'
Just then the boss steps into the middle of the ring and
says, holding a basket full of five-franc pieces, 'Now,
gentlemen, if there is any one among you who would
like to back himself against me, I'll undertake, if he
manages to down me, to hand over to him the contents
of this here basket&mdash;one hundred francs!'... Nobody
moved, so I says to Piatte, 'Shall we have a go?' But
Piatte, he says, 'Oh, we can't go in uniform.' So I says,
'I'll soon settle that,' and I went behind the tent, and I
tell one of the chaps to call the Guv'nor. 'Look here,' I
said, 'did you mean what you said just now?' 'I did,'
says the boss. 'Well, then, there's my chum and me,
we'd both like to have a try, but you see this is how
things stand&mdash;we can't wrestle in uniform, but if you
will lend us a costume we are game.'</p>

<p>"'Oh,' says the Guv'nor, 'I can do that, but if so, I
can only give you twenty-five francs if you downs me,
and in case you don't, you will have to deposit five francs
for the loan of the costume.'</p>

<p>"Piatte says he is quite game, but the Guv'nor must make
it five francs for the two. He agrees to this, and he takes
us to his caravan, where we change our things. While
we are doing this, the Guv'nor he had gone back to the
ring, and announced that two distinguished ammytoors
had accepted the challenge, he also goes to the outside
of his shanty and shouts out, 'There's going to be a grand
match of ammytoors <i>versus</i> professionals!'</p>

<p>"At the end of a few minutes he comes and calls us,
'Of course,' he says, 'you can't both come on at the same
time&mdash;which one of you will come first?'</p>

<p>"'I'll go first,' Piatte says.</p>

<p>"'By gad,' the Guv'nor then exclaims, as Piatte got up
from the corner where he was sitting. 'By gad, you ain't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
much of a show in uniform, but you are a strappin' 'un in
fleshings. Too heavy a bit, and clumsy-like, but you are
the kind of chap I like to measure myself with.' So they
goes to the ring, and the Guv'nor presents Piatte as the distinguished
ammytoor who is going to have a go. Piatte
makes his bow to the spectators, and the fun begins. I
watched it from a chink in the tent. At first I didn't
like the look of things. He was a fine chap the Guv'nor,
and he was on his mettle; he had got scientific ways too,
which told heavily on Piatte, but for all that he did not
last long, and Piatte felled his man. The crowd got mad
like at seeing the Guv'nor fairly beaten, and they gave Piatte
a real ovation. Piatte, businesslike, he catches hold of
a hat, and makes a collection among the spectators. He
got fifteen francs, my boy, and with the twenty-five francs
he had won, that made forty. Now came my turn, but
when I was brought into the ring and presented to the
ladies and gentlemen, I noticed two of our Lieutenants
and a Captain who marches in just then. I couldn't go
away, but I says to myself that they will never recognise
me, and we begin to wrestle. The Guv'nor was tired,
and he matched me with another chap. My boy, 'twas a
fight! It lasted more than twenty minutes, but at last I
downed my man, downed him straight and square, and
laid him on the two shoulders. When he gets up, the
Guv'nor, who felt sicklike at having lost his money,
shouts 'Foul!' All the spectators took my part, and the
officers got quite excited, and said he would have to pay
the money whether he liked or not. Piatte, whose blood
was up, he jumped into the ring and threatened to go for the
Guv'nor if he didn't fork out at once. Seeing how things
stood, the Guv'nor says as he'll abide by the decision of
the officers, so they jump into the ring. They hadn't
recognised me or Piatte up to then, and it was only when
one of them comes near me to tell me that I'm in the
right, that he stops suddenly, and stares at me, and cries,
'Why, you're a Dragoon!'</p>

<p>"I was so taken aback that at first I didn't know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to say, but seeing that none of the officers belonged to our
squadron, I said at last, quite bold like, 'Dragoon! sir!
You're making a mistake.'</p>

<p>"The officer, a Lieutenant, then turns to the Captain and
the other Lieutenant, and says, 'Why, look, this chap's a
Dragoon!'</p>

<p>"'D&mdash;d good fellow, if he is,' said the other Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"'Maybe,' says the Captain, 'but we can't have him
disgracing his uniform in this way.' He then whispered
something to the Lieutenants, and while they were talking,
Piatte sneaked out and went to dress. I slipped off too,
but the Captain followed me and caught me up at the steps
of the caravan.</p>

<p>"'It is thus, then,' he said, 'that you disgrace your
uniform.'</p>

<p>"'Beg your pardon, sir,' I says, 'but I didn't disgrace
my uniform, for I had no uniform on.' It was a pity I
said that, because it made the Captain real mad.</p>

<p>"'You have the impertinence to reply!' he then cries
out; 'I had come here only to lecture you, but as you
dare answer me I'll punish you. You will have eight
days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> for having exhibited yourselves in
public in a disgraceful way.' Just then he caught sight
of Piatte. 'Hallo! here's another one!' he says. 'You
shall have eight days too.'</p>

<p>"'Well, sir,' I says, 'if you will just allow me to say
so, it was me who answered you, and I didn't mean any
impertinence; but if you remember, you said that you only
wanted to give me a lecture, and 'twas only because I
answered you that you punished me, so would you mind
only punishing me, because Piatte there never answered
anything.'</p>

<p>"'You are a plucky one,' said the Captain, 'and a good
comrade, but I am sorry that I can't do what you ask me.
You both have been guilty of the same offence, and you
must both be punished, but I'll reduce your punishment
to four days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>.'</p>

<p>"He then wrote something on a card, and told me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
give it to the Sergeant of the Guard. 'Twas an order to
put us in the lock-up there and then, and you see we had
dressed in such a hurry that we forgot to take off our
fleshings, and when the Guv'nor came to ask for them,
the Captain, who had waited until we were dressed, told
us to go straight to barracks as we were, and I told the
Guv'nor that he would get back his fleshings when he had
paid us the 50 francs he owed us. But it was rare fun,
my boy," concluded Titi.</p>

<p>The following day Titi and Piatte were brought back to
the cells at eleven o'clock in the morning, the Colonel
having upon the Captain's report altered their punishment
into fifteen days' prison.</p>

<p>During the next few days the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> was so
crowded at night that, with the exception of the seven
prisoners, each of whom had a straw mattress and thus his
place marked out, the troopers were so crammed together
that they had to lie down on the planks huddled together
like herrings in a box.</p>

<p>I had already been twelve days in prison when I began
to feel extremely ill. I was suffering from fever and
dysentery, probably due to the vitiated air of the place,
and it is a wonder to me now how we all escaped typhoid
fever. I asked for the doctor, and when he had
examined me, he gave orders that I should be immediately
removed to hospital, where I was detained for a fortnight
before I recovered.</p>

<p>In February came the usual examination, after which
the Captain told me that he had hoped to be able to
discharge me from the service then, but that my behaviour
prevented his doing so. I need not describe for a second
time the drudgery of our daily work, which was a mere
repetition of what I had gone through the previous year.
De Cormet never allowed a week to pass without sending
me to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> on some pretext or other.
Lieutenant Amy had also taken a great dislike to me, but
I am bound to confess that he never punished me except
on one occasion. It was during the month of March; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
had been ordered to command the company, and I had to
get executed the movement of "Shoulder arms." I was
reciting the theory, and explaining the movement as stated
in the regulations, when Sergeant de Cormet interrupted
me in the middle of my explanation, and told me that I
was wrong. He made me begin again, and when I once
more reached the passage where he had interrupted me,
he asked why I altered the text of the regulations. I
replied that I did so because the previous year Sergeant
Legros had made us alter the passage, and had made us
learn it as I was then reciting it. "So," cried out de
Cormet, "now you take it upon yourself to alter the
regulations which have been drawn up by the highest
authorities in the army!"</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant," I said, "I have not taken it upon
myself, but was told to do so."</p>

<p>"Don't tell lies," retorted the Sergeant; "you will
have four days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> for not knowing your
theory."</p>

<p>"But, Sergeant," I said, "you can inquire from
Sergeant-major Legros whether I am telling you the
truth or not."</p>

<p>"You dare answer!" shouted the Sergeant. Just then
Lieutenant Amy came along, and hearing a row inquired
what was the matter. "It's Decle, of course, sir," de
Cormet told him.</p>

<p>"What has he done?" queried the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"The gentleman finds that the regulations are not
correct, and he takes it upon himself to correct them, and
has the impertinence to answer me that they are written
in bad French."</p>

<p>"I am sick of the fellow," replied the Lieutenant; "are
you mad, Decle?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," I answered very calmly, "and I wish to
observe that Sergeant de Cormet has not correctly
reported what I just now said to him."</p>

<p>"You scoundrel!" exclaimed the Lieutenant. "You
have the impudence to tell me that your Sergeant is a liar!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
You will have four days' prison." I knew by experience
that to complain, or appeal to the Colonel, would only
mean an increase of my punishment, and I therefore
quietly prepared myself to go to prison when I returned
to barracks. The overcrowding of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>
had become so great by that time that a special lock-up
was used for the prisoners, which was similar to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle</i>, but much smaller. I had once more Titi for a
companion, as he had been up to some more tricks, and
he was waiting his trial before <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de discipline</i>, which
had been convened to decide whether he should be sent to
a punishment battalion in Africa to finish his time or
service there. He didn't feel much depressed at the idea.
"It will be a change, old chap," he used to say to me,
"and I don't suppose that I shall be bullied there more
than I am here; besides, I have only one year and a half
more to serve, and that will soon be over." It was this
fact which saved him, and he was acquitted by a majority
of one, although the General bestowed sixty days' prison
on him for his last prank. (He had for the third time
absconded for five days.)</p>

<p>I had taken Conway's book to the prison, in order
to finish its translation, and only ten pages more were
left, when one of the Majors happened to walk in. The
door stood open to admit the trooper who was bringing
our food, and I had no time to put away my MS. The
Major pounced upon it. "That's how you occupy your
time," he said; "give me all those papers." I had to
hand them over to him, and he tore them up and chucked
the pieces into the slop-pail. So ended my first literary
attempt.</p>

<p>The four days I spent in prison, coupled with the moral
state of despair into which I had fallen, had pretty well
broken me down in health. I suffered from incessant
headaches and rheumatic pains, and I had to be sent
to hospital once more on coming out of prison.</p>

<p>All my thoughts were by that time concentrated upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
devising some means of leaving the hell the regiment had
become to me. Desertion was out of the question, not
that it would have been difficult for me to pass into
Belgium, or cross over to England, but I had too much
respect for myself and my family to turn a common
deserter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>


<p>I have omitted to mention that in compliance with the
regulations I had been obliged, before being taken to the
prison, to hand over to my Sergeant-major whatever
money or jewellery I had at the time. Accordingly I
handed over to Sergeant-major Vaillant my gold watch
and chain, £30 in bank-notes, and two valuable
rings, only keeping with me a few pounds in gold and
silver, which I carefully hid. The day before I was to
leave prison, the Sergeant-major came to see me, and
explained that as he was going away on leave he wanted
to give me back my belongings. This he did, and he
further reminded me that he owed me a long-standing
gambling debt of £5, and this he also handed over to me.
He added that he might be a long time away, and that I
could render him a great service by lending him some
civilian clothes. He had allowed me to keep in his room
a suit of clothes and an overcoat, and I told him that he
was very welcome to them. I also offered to lend him
some money, and suggested his paying me the gambling
debt on his return; but he absolutely refused to accept
either offer. He then bade me good-bye, and I thought no
more of the matter until a week later, when de Lanoy having
come to see me in hospital, startled me by saying that
Sergeant-major Vaillant had deserted, having absconded
the day before I left prison, and that he was further
accused by the Captain of having stolen 31 francs
from the moneys belonging to the squadron. I assured
de Lanoy that it was quite impossible that Vaillant
should have stolen the money, and I told him how he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
repaid me the large amount I had entrusted him with, and
even £5 that he owed me, and de Lanoy agreed with me
that if 32 francs (about 25<i>s.</i>) was missing from the
squadron money it was a pure mistake, and not a theft.
The following day Captain Hermann, who, as will be
remembered, was in command of our squadron, came to
the hospital and walked to my bed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Decle," he began, "that you are going
to find yourself in Queer Street. You probably know
that Sergeant-major Vaillant has deserted, but I should
like to know if you are aware that he has run off with
money belonging to the squadron, and that he has further
stolen your civilian clothes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I said, "I heard that Sergeant-major
Vaillant had deserted, but he has not stolen my clothes,
for the good reason that I lent them to him; and I don't
believe either that he has stolen any money from the
squadron."</p>

<p>"Just so," said the Captain; "what you have told me
fully confirms my information. You have helped the
Sergeant-major to desert, and you have given him £30 to
help him to do so."</p>

<p>I grew indignant. "I do not know, sir," I replied,
"where you derived your information from. Far from
having received money from me, the Sergeant-major came
to me while I was in prison and returned the £30 I had
entrusted him with, together with my jewellery, when I
was sent to prison, so that you see that you have been
quite misinformed."</p>

<p>"It's all very well for you to say so," replied the
Captain, "but I have only your word for it, while I have
distinct information that you lent him £30, and that
further he stole your clothes, and that you did not lend
them to him. Of course you must remember that, if it is
proved that you lent the Sergeant-major the money I
have mentioned, you will be court-martialled as an accessory
to his desertion. If you want, however, to avoid the
serious consequences of your act, I am prepared to over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>look
it provided that you swear that Sergeant-major
Vaillant has stolen your clothes."</p>

<p>"I am sorry I cannot do so, sir," I replied, "as that
would be committing perjury. I have previously lent the
Sergeant-major my clothes on several occasions, and I
also lent them to him in the present instance. As to
being court-martialled for having lent him £30, I am in
no way afraid of the consequences, for I can prove by my
solicitor's account that I did not lend him the money,
unless I stole it myself. In fact," I added, "I can
produce at once the very bank-notes he handed over to
me." And so saying, I pulled my pocket-book from
under the pillow, and showed the Captain the money.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "I know you've got money, but that
does not prove that you did not lend the £30. However,
you can please yourself; I have warned you, and whatever
happens will be your own fault."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I answered, "I fully understand."</p>

<p>The Captain retired, but a quarter of an hour later
he returned and insisted upon my swearing that the
Sergeant-major had stolen my clothes. He even went so
far as to promise me, or at least to make me understand,
that if I pleased him in the matter, he would see that I was
released from the regiment after the following examination.
But I was obdurate, and frankly told the Captain
that I quite understood his motives, and realised why he
was so anxious that I should give testimony as to the
theft of my clothes, for otherwise he would not be able to
obtain Vaillant's extradition from whatever country he
might have taken refuge in, and I once more declared
that whatever might be the consequences I would not
commit perjury.</p>

<p>The Captain retired in great wrath. The following
day the doctor told me that I would have to be at the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarmerie</i> at two o'clock.</p>

<p>When I arrived there I found an old Corporal of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarmes</i> sitting at a table, with another <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarme</i>
standing near him. He asked for my name, regimental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
number, and, as usual in France, I had also to give him
full particulars about my father and mother. Having
taken all this down, he told me to put up my right hand,
and to swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.
Having thus administered the oath to me he began to
question me.</p>

<p>"You had a suit of civilian clothes?" he first asked.</p>

<p>"Well," I replied, "I had, and still have, a good
many."</p>

<p>"Why do you have a good many?"</p>

<p>"Because I did not always wear the same suit."</p>

<p>"But you had a suit of clothes which has been stolen
from you by the Sergeant-major Vaillant?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I have had no suit of clothes stolen
from me. I lent Sergeant-major Vaillant a suit of clothes,
if that is what you are driving at."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarme</i>, evidently much
astonished, "how can you say that Sergeant-major
Vaillant did not steal a suit of clothes from you when
your Captain says he did!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what the Captain says," I replied, "and
what he says does not concern me. I am here on my
oath, I have sworn to tell the truth, and all you have to
do is to take down my words."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" said the old Corporal, turning
helplessly to his subordinate. "This is a most serious
matter. How on earth can I write down that a Dragoon
swears that he has had no clothes stolen when his
Captain says they have been stolen! That is what
discipline has come to nowadays," he went on. "When I
was in the Guards, if my Captain had said to me,
'Bouchard, some one has stolen your clothes,' I should
have said, 'Yes, sir!' But now, if the Colonel himself
were to say to a trooper, 'You're a nigger,' the fellow
would reply that he was a white man. And these are
the men who are going to lick the Prussians! It breaks
my old heart to see such goings on."</p>

<p>"Corporal," I insisted, "whether you like it or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
you will have to write down what I say. If you won't I
shall decline to sign the declaration, and shall state in
writing the reason for my refusal."</p>

<p>"I think you had better take down what he says,"
suggested the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarme</i>, and the Corporal, with a sigh,
proceeded to write out my deposition.</p>

<p>I gave a full account of all I knew about the matter,
pointing out that my Sergeant-major had, before leaving,
returned a large sum of money I had entrusted to him;
finally, having read my deposition through carefully, I
signed it.</p>

<p>When the old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarme</i> learned incidentally that I had
been in prison, he turned to his subordinate and cried
exultingly, "Of course he has! Of course! I knew all
along he was a bad un!"</p>

<p>And after I had signed the declaration he could not
refrain from a farewell shot. "Now, youngster," he said
impressively, "mark my words, for I don't make a mistake
often&mdash;you'll come to a bad end. It's always the case with
fellows who don't respect their betters. You begin with
the regimental prison; then, when your time is up, you
soon get a month or two, then a year, and it's not long
before you are sent to La Nouvelle,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and, if you don't get
a 'lifer,' it's ten to one 'The Widow'<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> ends your days."</p>

<p>With these encouraging words the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarme</i> dismissed
me, and the Sergeant took me back to the hospital, chaffing
me unmercifully all the way.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that the Captain had only threatened
me with a court-martial in order to try and induce me to
place documents in his hands which would enable him to
obtain an extradition warrant against Vaillant, who was
known to have taken refuge in Belgium. My deposition
defeated his object, but I afterwards heard that two years
later Vaillant surrendered, and was only sentenced to
twelve months' imprisonment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>The charge against him of stealing money belonging to
the squadron was withdrawn, my testimony showing that
he had no inducement to commit a petty theft.</p>

<p>When I left the hospital I entered once more on my
duties with the other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>, but although I did my
best to avoid punishments, I was a "marked man." I had
the misfortune, too, of being senior <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>, so that
whenever we were left without Sergeant or Corporal in
the schoolroom I was held responsible in case the others
caused a disturbance or indulged in horseplay.</p>

<p>One Saturday&mdash;kit inspection day&mdash;I discovered, when
I returned from the stables in the morning, that my great-coat
had been stolen. It was the only article of outfit of
which I had no duplicate, and after searching for it
throughout the room I could not find it. I reported the
matter to de Lanoy, my Sergeant, and he promised that
when all the great-coats were unrolled before the inspection
he would carefully examine the numbers. Although
he did this he was, however, unable to trace it. When
the officer came to pass the inspection, de Lanoy duly
reported the matter to him, but the Lieutenant merely
said that I had no business to have my great-coat stolen,
and gave me eight days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>. I was determined
to find the thief, and after making careful inquiries,
I learnt by accident that a trooper from the fourth
squadron had been through our room while we were at
morning stables. I heard this while we were coming back
from afternoon stables, and I accordingly rushed to the
fellow's room, and pulling down the great-coat which was
rolled up and placed on the shelf above his bed, I unrolled
it, and found that it was my own. Just then the trooper,
a Parisian rough, came into the room, and asked me with
a volley of oaths what the devil I was doing there. I was
in no mood to stand abuse, and I replied in forcible
language that he was a thief, and had stolen my great-coat.
Thereupon he struck at me, and we had a fierce
fight. Twice he knocked me down, and the second time
he kicked me viciously before I could rise: we had closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
once more, and I had given him a blow which made his teeth
rattle, when the Sergeant-major of his squadron, hearing
the disturbance, walked into the room. He separated us,
and gave each of us four days' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> for fighting
in the room. I tried to explain to him what had taken
place, but he would not listen to me, and sent me back to
my room, where I retired&mdash;with my great-coat.</p>

<p>The following day the Colonel ordered "that the
troopers Gerbal and Decle, who had fought in the room,
would fight a duel on the Monday morning in the riding-school."</p>

<p>I have omitted to mention that all troopers at the end
of six months had to spend one hour every week in the
fencing school, where they were taught fencing with the
sword and the foils. A good many of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaires</i>
used also to take extra lessons, and, for my own part, I
used to take one daily. The moment I heard that I was
to fight a duel on the following day, I went to the fencing-master
to ask his advice. He told me that we should
have to fight with cavalry swords, not, however, of the
kind we were accustomed to use, but with old-fashioned
swords of the 1810 pattern. He produced one of these&mdash;I
had never seen such an unwieldy weapon. The blade
was about four feet long, and when you held the sword
in your hand, it was so badly balanced that all the weight
seemed to be thrown towards the point. The fencing-master
explained to me that in regimental duels all
strokes were legitimate from the head down to the knee.
He then made me practise with the sword in question, but
although I was a pretty good fencer, I confess that I was at
first absolutely at sea with the weapon I had in my hand.
In the evening I took an extra lesson, and got a little
more accustomed to the use of the cumbrous sword.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i267.jpg" width="600" height="422" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A DUEL IN THE RIDING-SCHOOL</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The encounter was to take place at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Each of
us had selected a second, and we were told to come to
the riding-school in stable costume, being allowed to use
whatever shoes we liked. When I arrived with my
second I found the two doctors present, with half a dozen
officers and the fencing-master, who had brought the
swords. We were told to strip to the waist, our weapons
were handed over to us, and the fencing-master, having
put us on guard, stood between us, holding in his
hand a scabbard with which he was supposed to stop
any deadly stroke. My adversary was a regular bully,
and of course a coward, and had imbibed a large quantity
of brandy to brace himself up, and when we were placed
in position I noticed that he was flushed, and that he was
shaking all over. His second, noticing the state he was
in, whispered to him, "Buck up, old man; don't be
afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid," he replied aloud, "I ain't afraid: it's the cold
that gives me the shivers."</p>

<p>He was sharply rebuked and warned that he must
remain silent. The fencing-master then released our swords,
which he held crossed, and gave us the signal "Go."
I made a few feints and could have easily touched my opponent,
but I meant to inflict a serious injury on the ruffian,
and did not take advantage of the chances he gave me.
The beginning of the duel was rather a farce, as the
fellow kept jumping back whenever I made a feint, and
at the end of a minute or two he had already retreated
ten paces. The fencing-master ordered us to stop, and
warned him that if he went on retreating in that way he
would stick him in a corner. We were then placed once
more in position, and the second round began. My
adversary showed a little more pluck this time, and the
moment the signal was given he made a cut at my head,
but I easily parried it, and in doing so my sword slightly
scratched his arm; we had closed, and I was watching
the moment when he would step back, to slip my sword
alongside his and with a "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une, deux</i>" to stick him in the
ribs. Just then, however, his second noticed a drop of
blood on his arm, and the duel was once more stopped.
The doctor came forward to examine the "wound," but
he declared that it was just a scratch, and that we must
go on. My adversary raised strong objections to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
decision, saying that the duel being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au premier sang</i> (to
be stopped the moment blood was drawn), and blood
having been drawn, he acknowledged that he was beaten,
and that ought to put an end to it, as he was not at all
keen to bleed me. The officers, the fencing-master, and
even his second could not help laughing, and the fencing-master,
without replying, placed us once more in position, and
for the third time gave us the signal "Go!" I was getting
very tired, the weight of the sword telling heavily on my
wrist, and I determined to put a speedy end to the
encounter. I made a series of quick feints, and as the
man uncovered himself well I quickly raised my sword to
strike him a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de flanc</i> which would have cut him
along the chest from the shoulder to the waist; seeing
this the fencing-master put up his scabbard to stop the
blow, and instead of striking the man, my sword fell on
the fencing-master's scabbard, and just as the fencing-master
cried "Halt!" my adversary, taking advantage of
my defenceless position, stuck the point of his sword in my
wrist. The duel was at once stopped, and I dropped my
sword, my fingers becoming instantly benumbed.</p>

<p>The doctor bandaged my arm and sent me to the dispensary.
It was of course a cowardly act, deliberately
done, but the same thing constantly happens in military
duels, and even when the two adversaries fight quite
fairly. Good fencers have hardly any chance, as the
fencing-master, who is responsible for the conduct of the
duel, has to stop any strokes which may possibly endanger
the life of one of the adversaries, and when he stops the
sword of one of them, the other may not stop in time, and
he thus wounds the first. In my case things were still
worse, as my adversary had deliberately struck me while I
was incapable of defending myself, my sword resting on
the fencing-master's scabbard. I must, however, acknowledge
that the officers who were present at the duel reported
what had taken place, and the ruffian with whom
I had been fighting was punished with thirty days' prison.
Had I been fairly wounded I should have had eight days'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> myself for having fought a duel under
orders, as in my time it was customary to punish the
wounded man, absurd as this may appear.</p>

<p>Military duels are certainly a most ridiculous custom,
as ridiculous indeed as Parliamentary duels. It is well
known beforehand that neither of the adversaries will be
seriously hurt, and therefore the point of fighting at all
seems obscure. The idea is, I believe, that duelling acts
as a deterrent to fights between soldiers&mdash;Frenchmen,
like most citizens of the other Continental nations, considering
the use of fists a low and degrading way of
settling a quarrel. Duels between officers are also
frequent, but they can only fight if they hold the same
rank; for instance, no Captain can fight a duel with a
Lieutenant, nor can a Major challenge a Captain. Officers
must in any case obtain their Colonel's leave to fight.
No officer, challenged by one of his comrades, would dare
to refuse to fight; if he did so, he would probably be
severely punished by the Colonel and sent to Coventry
by his comrades.</p>

<p>When I reached the dispensary my wound was thoroughly
washed. It was only then that it began to hurt me; when
the sword penetrated my wrist I did not feel it in the least,
the only sensation I had being that of sudden numbness
in the fingers. On examination, the wound proved more
serious than it had appeared at first, several of the tendons
having been severed. I was therefore detained at the
infirmary, and after a couple of days inflammation set in,
this being due, I believe, to the fact that during one of the
stoppages which had occurred in the course of the duel
my adversary had stuck his sword in the ground. It must
also be remembered that antiseptics were not known then
as they are now, so that my wound had only been washed
with a solution of salt and water. This duel (if such a
name can be given to such a farce) was, I may add, the
first and the last I ever fought or shall fight. It seems
incredible that such an absurd custom should subsist
among civilised nations. It is due, I suppose, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
lack of means of redress found in the Continental laws in
case of slander or libel. In France, for instance, men in
a prominent position are daily insulted and dragged through
the mire by unscrupulous journalists (some newspapers
making it even a speciality to get hold of society scandals
and subsisting upon the hush-money they extort from
their victims), yet it is very seldom that action is taken
in the courts. It is no exaggeration to say that there are
hundreds of men in France who would each have recovered
damages amounting to at least one million sterling if all
the libels which have appeared against them in the French
papers within the last ten years had been published in
the English press and brought before a British jury. As
it is, £20 damages are considered very substantial. This
may partly explain why duelling still exists.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>


<p>Had been a fortnight in the infirmary, when one morning
at ten o'clock one of the Sergeants of my squadron
ordered me to dress in tunic and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">képi</i>, saying that he had
received orders to take me before the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil</i>. This word
simply means court, and is applied to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de
discipline</i> (regimental court-martial) as well as to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de réforme</i> (Invalidation Commission), but I had
by that time become so accustomed to threats of being
sent before a regimental court-martial, that I could only
think of that, and asked the Sergeant on what charge I
was going to be tried.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you," he replied, smiling.</p>

<p>He was a friend of mine, and I thought him most
heartless to ridicule my trouble. In vain I asked him,
while I was dressing, to explain what it meant, but he
would not, and tortured me by asking in a jocular way
how I would like a change of air and surroundings. At
last I lost my temper.</p>

<p>"It's all very fine," I said, "to chaff a fellow when you
know that he is going to be sent for three years and a
half to hard labour in Algeria. You are simply a brute,
that's all I can say."</p>

<p>"But suppose I don't know anything of the kind?" he
replied, still smiling. "Why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose, if I am going to be tried before the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de discipline</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You ass!" he laughingly replied; "who spoke to you
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de discipline</i>? Aren't there other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseils</i>?"</p>

<p>I looked astonished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you never heard of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de réforme</i>?"
(Invalidation Commission) he said.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "I do mean to say that you are proposed
for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">invalidation</i>, and most likely you will cease to
be a Dragoon this afternoon."</p>

<p>My heart nearly stopped. The Corporal in charge of
the infirmary came in at that moment (I had been put
alone in a small ward of only two beds).</p>

<p>"You've heard the news?" he said.</p>

<p>I asked him how it had happened, and how I had not
heard of it sooner. He proceeded to explain that, for the
last two or three months past, our surgeon had meant to
have me invalided, but that the Surgeon-major of the
infantry, who was senior surgeon of the district, had
always scratched my name off the list, as he had taken a
particular dislike to me, and also wished to spite our
surgeon, whom he hated. The previous day this infantry
surgeon had been suddenly summoned to his mother's
bedside in the South of France, so that Surgeon-major
Lesage (our own surgeon) was in his absence the head
of the medical service, and as such he had included me in
the list of men proposed for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">invalidation</i>. My joy knew
no bounds, and my only fear was that the Commission
would reject the proposal.</p>

<p>I was taken to the hospital with five other Dragoons,
and on arriving there we found half a dozen men from
the Line regiment, who were also to be examined.</p>

<p>At 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the members of the Commission arrived,
but we did not see them coming, as they entered the room
where we were to be examined by another door.</p>

<p>At the end of a few minutes a Dragoon was called in:
he was the Breton of whom I spoke at the beginning of
this book, who cried so bitterly at the thought of his cow.
Since he had joined the regiment the poor fellow had
gradually been sinking, and he was reduced to a mere
skeleton. They did not keep him long, and when he
came out he was laughing and crying hysterically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
"Sergeant," he cried, "oh, Sergeant, let me kiss you! I
am going to see her again, my cow, and the hens and the
fields, the dear old house!"</p>

<p>He had put his arms round the Sergeant's neck, and
was sobbing like a child on his shoulders. He then sat
on one of the benches, and kept saying, "I should have
died, you know, if they had not sent me home. It's the
Blessed Virgin&mdash;she has heard my prayers! I prayed
so hard to her, and every Sunday I burnt a candle before
her altar. I must go and thank her."</p>

<p>He then asked the Sergeant to let him go to the church,
but the latter said that he was not allowed to let him
leave the hospital until the Commission had retired.</p>

<p>"Then I will thank her here; she will hear all the
same." And so saying the poor fellow knelt down and
buried his head in his hands, muttering a prayer. It was
so genuine, so simple, and yet so beautiful, that not a
single one of those coarse soldiers assembled there
thought of chaffing him, although he had been unmercifully
derided for saying his prayers in the room at the
barracks.</p>

<p>In the meantime two other men had been examined,
the last one being sent back to his service. Then came
the turn of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Volontaire</i>, a poor fellow whose knee-cap had
been broken. Although the doctors were unanimous in
declaring that he would <i>not be able to walk at all for two
years</i>, and although certificates from two of the greatest
French surgeons, who had been sent by his family to
operate on him, were produced, stating that he would be
lame for life, the Commission refused to invalid him!
When my turn came my heart was beating so fast that I
could hardly speak.</p>

<p>One of our Majors presided over the Commission, of
which the other members were two Captains and four
Lieutenants. To my horror, Captain Hermann was one
of them. Our Surgeon-major, assisted by the assistant
Surgeon-major of the Line regiment, examined each man.</p>

<p>I was presented by Surgeon-major Lesage: "This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Trooper Decle," he said; "he is absolutely unfit for
service. He suffers from general weakness of constitution
and heart palpitation." The other doctor examined my
heart and confirmed my Surgeon-major's diagnosis. The
assistant Surgeon-major said that he fully shared Surgeon-major
Lesage's views, and was absolutely in favour of my
being invalided.</p>

<p>"I should like to listen to the fellow's heart myself,"
remarked the Major.</p>

<p>"By all means," said the doctor, smiling, for he knew
that the Major knew nothing of medicine.</p>

<p>I stood beside the Major and he put his bald head
against my chest. Of course my heart was beating
furiously, as I was in a blue funk about the decision which
would be arrived at.</p>

<p>"I would be sorry to exchange with him," growled the
old Major, "he's a regular roarer."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said the Surgeon-major, "you
have heard Major Vieu confirm what I told you, and I
will ask you to pronounce your decision."</p>

<p>"Allow me to ask you first," said Captain Hermann,
"whether the trooper could not do his service in the
infantry?"</p>

<p>"I would not have him," replied the infantry doctor.</p>

<p>"But supposing we sent him into the transport service,"
again suggested Captain Hermann.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Surgeon-major Lesage; "you are
wasting your time and mine. Invalid him, or don't
invalid him&mdash;that's for you to decide; but I warn you
that if you don't invalid him I shall make him finish his
term in hospital."</p>

<p>"Come on, Hermann," said the Major, half asleep,
"we have a lot of others to see; let us vote&mdash;I want my
lunch."</p>

<p>"What do you say?" asked Surgeon-major Lesage
from the youngest Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Oh, invalid him," he quickly replied.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the next Lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said his neighbour.</p>

<p>"No," replied the fourth Lieutenant, who sat near
Captain Hermann.</p>

<p>"Decidedly not," said my Captain.</p>

<p>This looked bad; two nays to three ayes.</p>

<p>"Better invalid him," said the second Captain.</p>

<p>"By all means," murmured the Major with his eyes
shut.</p>

<p>I was no longer a trooper! I thought I was going to
faint.</p>

<p>"Invalidation No. 1?" queried the doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," the Major cried, striking his chair with his
fist; "but d&mdash;&mdash; it, let us go on. I want my lunch, and
I am off if you don't hurry up."</p>

<p>A form was filled in by the dispensary Corporal acting
as clerk: this was signed, and the doctor told me that my
papers would be handed over to me in the evening.</p>

<p>When I came out there was no need to ask me what
the result was: it was written on my face.</p>

<p>"Must I congratulate you?" asked the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, shaking him by the hand; "but tell me,"
I added, "what does 'Invalidation No. 1' mean?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that they have granted you
that! Why, man alive! it means a pension of £24 a
year for life!"</p>

<p>I was astounded. Half an hour later the Commission
had retired, and I suggested stopping at a café on our way
back to barracks. The Sergeant assented, and I
offered him and my comrades a bottle of champagne to
celebrate this glorious day&mdash;the happiest day in my
existence, I believe. When I returned to the barracks I
met Sergeant de Cormet in the yard.</p>

<p>"Where are you coming from?" he cried: "I thought
that you were at the infirmary."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant, but I have just come from a turn in the
town."</p>

<p>"We shall see about that," he answered.</p>

<p>"I went out on duty, Sergeant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll make sure of that; but in any case," he sneered,
"you won't be always at the infirmary, and when you
come out you will soon find yourself in the wrong box."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Sergeant," I said, laughing; "in fact,
I am going to Paris to-night."</p>

<p>"With whose leave, please?"</p>

<p>"Superior authorities," I said.</p>

<p>"If you mean to laugh at me," he replied in angry
tones, "I shall have you consigned to prison."</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant, no more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, prison, or
cells for me&mdash;in fact, in case I do not see you again, I
shall wish you good-bye now, or rather <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</i>, as I
hope I may meet you soon. You see I am no longer a
Dragoon: I have just been invalided."</p>

<p>"It can't be," he said, astounded. "<i>I</i> should have heard
of your being proposed for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">invalidation</i>."</p>

<p>"You don't hear everything," I replied; "but if you
don't believe me, here comes the dispensary Corporal, and
he has my papers."</p>

<p>He did not add a word, and went off shrugging his
shoulders eloquently.</p>

<p>The news soon spread through the barracks, and many
were the congratulations I received.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Surgeon-major came to the
infirmary, where I expressed my deep thanks to him.
He told me that I should have to sleep in the barracks
again that night, as an error had been made in drawing
up my papers, a pension having been granted to me by
mistake. As to this I was quite indifferent, for I would
willingly have given more than £1000 to have secured
my release. The Surgeon-major also advised me to be
very careful until I had received my papers, and changed
my uniform for civilian clothes, for until this was done I
was still under military law. The following morning my
papers were handed over to me, and I returned all my
outfit to the regimental stores, making a present to Titi
and Piatte of all such uniforms and kits as were my
personal property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>I gave twenty francs to the troopers of my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peloton</i> to
drink my health, and I did not forget my friends Titi and
Piatte. I then took leave of my Sergeants, gave a parting
kiss to my charger, and stepped into the street, a free
man at last! Half an hour later I had discarded my
uniform for ever. Not only had I ceased to be a Dragoon,
but I had also altogether ceased to belong to the French
army.</p>

<p>A fortnight later I arrived in England, a country I
already loved, and ever since my life has been spent in
travelling through the vast domains of the British Empire;
and I feel proud to think that it has fallen to my lot to
be numbered among those who have helped to enlighten
Englishmen on the glorious work of those great men who
have laid the foundation of a gigantic African Empire.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</a></h2>


<p>It will probably be believed by many readers that in
describing my life as a soldier I have at times given the
reins to my imagination; but I can only assure them that
this is not the case. I have, fortunately or unfortunately,
an excellent memory, and the scenes and conversations I
have described are ineffaceably engraved on my mind.</p>

<p>That much of my narrative is occupied with the constantly
recurring punishments that befell me, is not my
fault&mdash;to have slurred over those punishments would have
been to paint a misleading picture of my military career,
its most salient feature being omitted.</p>

<p>It cannot, at all events, be said with any plausibility
that my lot must unfortunately have been cast amongst
the scum of the French army. The scum, if any exist, is
not to be sought in a cavalry regiment.</p>

<p>Let me, with reference to this point, briefly indicate the
relative <i>status</i> of the three great branches of the service
from an educational point of view. Although it is now
possible to secure a commission through the ranks almost
as quickly as through the military schools, a preliminary
liberal education is absolutely necessary, especially in the
cavalry and artillery, as most difficult examinations have
to be passed, and the successful candidates must then
spend one year in a special military school, as St.
Maixant for the infantry, and Saumur for the cavalry.
Before leaving the school a final examination has also
to be passed in order to obtain a commission. In case of
failure in this, candidates are allowed to remain for
another year in the school, but if they are unable to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
at the end of that time, they are sent back to their
regiment.</p>

<p>To become an officer without passing through the ranks
it is necessary to be admitted to the St. Cyr military
school for the infantry and cavalry, and to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">École
Polytechnique</i> for the artillery. At the end of the second
year at St. Cyr a competitive examination is undergone,
and only those who are at the head of the list have the
choice between cavalry and infantry. Those who are
thus admitted to serve in the cavalry spend their third
year in a class apart from the Cadets who are to become
officers in the line. At the end of the third year the
Cadets pass a final examination, after which they receive
their commission. Those who are drafted into the line at
once join a regiment, while those who serve in the cavalry
have to spend another year in the cavalry school of
Saumur before joining. It will therefore be seen that
cavalry officers are, educationally, picked men.</p>

<p>This applies still more strikingly to artillery officers, for
these have all passed through the Polytechnic School, the
highest engineering school in France. After leaving the
Polytechnic they spend a year at the artillery school of
Fontainebleau, whence they are drafted into a regiment as
full Lieutenants. There are cases of artillery officers
having worked their way to a commission through the
ranks, but these instances are quite exceptional, and it is
very seldom that such officers reach a higher rank than
that of Captain. On the contrary, a large percentage of the
infantry officers get their commissions through the ranks.</p>

<p>That improvements have been effected since my time
I gladly admit. The reforms instituted by the much-abused
General Boulanger have been already touched
upon, and their value must not be under-estimated.</p>

<p>To quote but a few of them&mdash;he abolished the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de
Police</i> for non-commissioned officers, replacing it by confinement
to the room. He extended from 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to 11
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the time at which non-commissioned officers had to
be back in barracks, this time being extended to midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in the case of re-enlisted N.C.O.s. He allowed the
latter a higher pay, a separate room, and the right of
wearing clothes made of fine cloth of the same quality
as that worn by the officers, and gave non-commissioned
officers the right to live outside the barracks. He then
withdrew from Corporals, Sergeants, and other non-commissioned
officers the right of punishing privates with
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i>, the only punishment they can now inflict
being confinement to barracks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, these regulations can be easily
evaded, for when a Corporal or a Sergeant wants to send
a man to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> he has only to report him to
the Lieutenant of the Week, who hardly ever fails to put
down whatever punishment the Corporal or non-commissioned
officer asks him to inflict; or, again, if a Corporal
or non-commissioned officer wants to have a man
punished with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de Police</i> he has only to give the fellow
the maximum number of days of "C.B." (confinement to
barracks) he is allowed to give, and justify the punishment
by a strong motive, and in that case the Captain will never
fail to transform the punishment into lock-up.</p>

<p>General Boulanger also added much to the comfort
of privates and Corporals, by ordering that they should
have their meals served at table and presided over by a
Corporal. The food of the ten to twelve men sitting at
each table was to be served in a dish, portions being distributed
to each man on an enamelled plate by the Corporal
or table president. This regulation, which has
remained in force ever since, introduces a great improvement
on the way we were fed in my time&mdash;as will be
obvious from my previous description. Last, but not
least, General Boulanger fixed at 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> instead of 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
the time at which privates had to return to barracks in the
evening. The General's extraordinary popularity is therefore
hardly to be wondered at if one remembers that every
Frenchman has to be a soldier.</p>

<p>It is, of course, quite clear that one of the greatest blots
in the system I have described&mdash;that is to say, the system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
actually adopted, and not the ideal one depicted in the
regulations&mdash;is that the cavalry officers trust almost entirely
to the Sergeants to look after the drill, discipline, and comfort
of their men. During my twenty months' service the
Colonel did not come fifty times to the barracks, and then
rarely stayed there for an hour at a time. Except during the
general yearly inspection, the Lieutenant-Colonel or Majors
did not pass once a month through our rooms, and then
merely marched through them in a perfunctory manner.</p>

<p>The Captain in command of my squadron sometimes, it
it is true, came to our room, usually on the weekly inspection
day, but a fortnight or three weeks often elapsed
between his visits. My Lieutenant came to our room on
the weekly inspection day, but rarely at other times.
None of our officers ever came to look at our food.</p>

<p>As to the drill, until the squadron drilled together the
officers hardly ever troubled themselves about it. During
the first five months' preliminary training, troopers were
left entirely to the care of the Sergeants and Corporals,
the Lieutenants looking on for perhaps a few minutes at a
time. When, in April, the troopers began to be drilled in
squares marked out on the man&oelig;uvring ground, the
officers used to ride over there, and every quarter of an
hour or so glanced at the square where their men were
riding under the command of a Sergeant. "Stables"
were superintended by the officer of the week, but as in
the 1st and 2nd squadrons (as well as in the 4th and 5th)
one officer took the week in turn for the two combined
squadrons, he could not be expected to see much of what
was going on, among the 250 horses or thereabouts he
had to superintend. Lieutenants and Sub-lieutenants,
except when they were on "week" duty, never came to
the stables, so that really everything devolved on the
Sergeants, whose power and responsibility were consequently
enormous.</p>

<p>Another consequence of the French military system is
that officers and rank and file alike are absolutely wanting
in that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> which is so remarkable in British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
regiments. That privates should feel no particular pride
in the body to which they are temporarily, and for the
most part unwillingly, attached, is not to be wondered at,
but in the case of officers a different explanation is forthcoming.</p>

<p>Strange to say, it is a general rule in the French army
that officers, on their promotion to a superior rank, are
always sent into another regiment (the only exception
occurring in the case of Sub-lieutenants, who sometimes&mdash;but
rarely&mdash;remain in the same regiment upon their promotion
to the rank of Lieutenant). The consequence of
this rule is that an officer who reaches the rank of Colonel
has often served in six different regiments. It even often
happens, for instance, that a Lieutenant of Dragoons is
drafted into the Hussars on his promotion as a Captain,
and then passes into the Cuirassiers when he becomes a
Major, being transferred to the Chasseurs as Lieutenant-Colonel,
and then being put in command of a regiment of
Dragoons as Colonel.</p>

<p>The hard-and-fast lines of social distinction which
are drawn between officers of different ranks are also
fatal obstacles to the corporate well-being of the regiment.
The idea, for instance, that Captains would demean
themselves if they sat at the same table with Lieutenants
and Sub-lieutenants, and that Majors must also form a
separate mess, hinders social intercourse between officers
of the different ranks, and seems almost to indicate the
possibility of subalterns forgetting themselves in the presence
of their superior officers. How different the English
system, where all officers mess together, meeting in the
simple equality of gentlemen!</p>

<p>There is a general idea in France that German soldiers
are subjected to a much stricter discipline than French
soldiers, and that German officers may strike their men
and treat them like slaves. I believe this was so at the
time of the Franco-Prussian War, for I then saw such
acts of barbarity committed by officers; but the present
system is very different. To begin with, no punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
can be inflicted by a non-commissioned officer or even by
a Lieutenant, Captains alone having the right to punish;
and I even saw a case, during one of my numerous visits
to Germany, when the Captain commanding a company
was severely reprimanded by his Colonel, who withdrew
from him the right of punishment altogether, because
there were too many men punished under his command;
the Colonel arguing, with much force, that if an officer
could not maintain discipline without constantly punishing
his men it proved that he did not know how to deal with
soldiers, and that therefore he was unfit to decide whether
a man ought to be punished or not.</p>

<p>So far as my punishments are concerned I have no
wish to pose as a martyr, and I acknowledge that some
of them were deserved; but if I had been treated like a
free human being, and not like a convict&mdash;if I had not
been bullied, as well as unjustly and unduly punished
I should not have become&mdash;as I did&mdash;desperate, caring
little whether I was punished or not. I fully understand
and excuse the motives which prompt so many men to
desert&mdash;men who have neither position nor reputation to
maintain&mdash;and I frankly declare that, rather than have
served another year, I would have become a deserter
myself.</p>

<p>Had war broken out when I was a trooper, I am quite
sure that the first battle would have resulted in the death
of at least three of our officers and four of our Sergeants,
and that they would not have fallen under the enemy's
bullets. This may be a terrible thing to say, but I knew
two troopers who were determined to do the deed. It
was not mere brag, for it was by accident that I heard
them more than once discussing the matter.</p>

<p>In my own case I am persuaded that my Captain and
my Colonel, relying blindly on the N.C.O.s, were honestly
convinced that I was a bad character. Five years after I
left the regiment I met one of my former officers, who was
then military attaché to one of the embassies. He did
not recognise me, and did not catch my name. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
course of conversation I inquired whether he had known
a man named Decle, who had served in his regiment.</p>

<p>"Don't I remember him!" he said. "He was a most
incorrigible rogue! My friend Captain Hermann often
spoke to me about him: he was a fellow who would never
do any work, and who was most ungrateful. Although fairly
intelligent, he worked so little that he was classed last at
the final examination, and they had to keep him a second
year. I remember that there was some talk of sending
him before a court-martial, as he once made serious false
allegations against his Sergeant-major. Altogether he
was a bad lot. Do you know what has become of him?"
I replied in the affirmative, and the military attaché asked
me somewhat anxiously if I knew him well.</p>

<p>"He is my best friend," I replied, "and you are now
talking to him." The attaché looked much embarrassed,
but I soon put him at his ease, and assured him that
I was in no way offended. I told him exactly what had
happened, and he acknowledged that it was too true that,
in many cases, officers formed their opinion entirely from
Sergeants' reports, "but," he added helplessly, "what else
can we do?" And he really seemed to think the question
unanswerable.</p>

<p>I had a good opportunity of personally observing the
practical working of French military organisation at the
time of the Madagascar war.</p>

<p>Everything was at sixes and sevens.</p>

<p>Plans were made one day and altered the next; the
Minister of War wanted one thing, the Commander-in-Chief
wanted another; and if these two high authorities
had not been seconded by two of the most admirable
and practical officers in the French service (General
de Torcy, and Major, now General, Bailloud), things
would have gone even worse than they did. The Intelligence
Department, too, was conspicuous by its lack of
information. The French military authorities did me the
honour to consult me on many points, but unfortunately,
as it turned out, the advice I gave was rejected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
General Mercier, then Minister of War. I was asked to
give my opinion about transport in general, and I first
asked how many white men would take part in the
Expedition, and inquired how the transport of supplies
would be organised. The answer was that 6000 iron
carts, drawn by mules, would be used for the service. I
pointed out that the use of such carts would be absolute
madness, as I knew by my own experience how easily iron
carts are broken, and how impossible it is to repair
them, and I added that under the circumstances the army
would never be able to go forward unless a road was
made. I then inquired how the soldiers' knapsacks would
be carried, and General Duchesne, the Commander-in-Chief
of the Expedition, to whom I put this question,
replied that "of course the men would carry them themselves."
"In that case," I said, "you may reckon that
one half of your force will have died within six months of
their landing in Madagascar."</p>

<p>The General said that it was all nonsense&mdash;that the men
had carried their knapsacks in the Tonkin War, and could
do so quite well in Madagascar.</p>

<p>My prediction unfortunately turned out perfectly correct,
and nearly six thousand men died within six months of
the beginning of the operations. A road had to be made
for the iron carts, and if the natives had not proved arrant
cowards, the war would have ended in frightful disaster.
It was only due to the untiring energy of Colonel Bailloud,
who was in charge of the transport, that the troops were
enabled to receive any supplies.</p>

<p>What struck me most, however, in that expedition was
the jealousy between the Army and the Navy.</p>

<p>During the Tonkin War, the supreme command of the
naval and military forces had been vested in Admiral
Corbet, and the military officers strongly objected to
being commanded by a sailor. In order, therefore, to
avoid a repetition of what had then taken place, the
whole of the flotilla which was sent to Madagascar was
placed under the command of a mere Captain, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
to take orders from the General commanding the troops.
The Navy, of course, resented what they considered a
slight, and carefully avoided helping the Army in any
way. Of course they did not openly display their rivalry,
but they took good care to give no help whatever to the
Military Chiefs, allowing them to commit the greatest
blunders without warning them beforehand. For instance,
the War Office having decided to use the River Betsiboka
as far as it was navigable, a large number of steel barges
were sent over to Menjunka, which was supposed to be
at the mouth of the river. Unfortunately, the real mouth
of the river stood nearly thirty miles farther inland, so
that, unless the weather was perfectly calm, the barges
were swamped before they had reached the river itself;
the water on the other hand being too shallow to enable
steamers, except those of the smallest draft, to reach the
mouth. When I arrived in Madagascar, in a small 180-ton
steamer I had chartered in Zanzibar, I was ordered
to follow the course of the river as far as I could go, and
to make a survey on my way, as none existed. After considerable
trouble I managed to get about seventy miles
inland, and on my return to Menjunka, as I was making
my report to the General, the naval officer in command
walked into the room just as I was asking the General
whether he could allow me twenty-four hours to put my
survey on paper. The naval officer inquired what survey
I was speaking of, and on being told that it was a survey
of the river, he replied that I had been wasting my time,
as his officers "had surveyed it long ago, long ago"; and
he added that he would send it to the General when he
returned to his ship. He knew perfectly well, before I left,
that I had been instructed to make a survey, but he had
never offered to hand over to the General the map he had
in his possession.</p>

<p>Again, the Naval Commander was fully aware that a
large number of transports were coming, but he carefully
abstained from advising the War Office that there was
only one steam launch at Menjunka to land the cargo, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the consequence was that at one time there lay as many
as twenty-four steamers in the harbour, with no means of
unloading them; an average of £200 per day having to
be paid for demurrage on each. I could quote scores
of similar instances, but it is not my object to write the
history of the Madagascar campaign.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Englishmen regard their own "little
army" with a just pride, tempered by a consciousness of
its more or less obvious defects; but when any comparison
is suggested between the British forces and the
"bloated armaments" of the Continent, the pride is apt
to become humility, and deprecatory remarks are made to
the effect that we do not, of course, profess to be a great
military power.</p>

<p>Yet how does the case really stand? Are these armed
multitudes as formidable as mere arithmetic would have
us think? France, for instance, prides herself upon being
able to put in the field millions of trained men. What
does this boast amount to? Upon the outbreak of war,
in these days of rapid mobilisation, much&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;would
depend upon the troops first in the field. And
these troops, upon whose behaviour in the brunt of
sudden battle the salvation of their country might depend,
would be&mdash;not a body of well-trained fighting-men, leavened
with veterans, and relying on their leaders with glad
confidence&mdash;but a crowd of half-taught lads, lacking in
thews as well as training, and led&mdash;or driven&mdash;to battle by
officers whom either they have never seen until the day of
conflict, or whom they know&mdash;and hate.</p>

<p>As for the reserves, suffice it to say that officers of the
active army refuse to regard them seriously, and consider
them merely in the light of civilians playing at soldiering.
The officers of the reserve (for the most part promoted
privates) have received no military education worthy of
the name. The non-commissioned officers and men
consider the month they have to serve every other year a
hateful episode. Awkward in their unaccustomed uniforms,
they do not even look like soldiers, and it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
take months of training to convert them into such once
more. In point of efficiency they are, of course, far
inferior to our Volunteers.</p>

<p>But behind these stands yet another "line of defence"&mdash;the
territorial army and its reserve&mdash;an army composed
of men who have a faint recollection that they once
were drilled. There is something pathetic, as well as
absurd, in picturing these middle-aged citizens in time of
war, clad in antiquated uniforms, handling unaccustomed
weapons, and painfully, if conscientiously, struggling to
acquire a knowledge of new regulations and modern drill.
To sum all up, it may be true that Providence is still on
the side of the big battalions, but chiefly, we think, when
those battalions are well officered, well trained, and
animated with all the virtues of the soldier.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_A" id="APPENDIX_A">APPENDIX A</a></h2>

<p>No allusion has been made in the Introduction to the pay
of officers, nor to the actual cost of the keep of troopers.
Being unable to find any documents on which to base my
calculations, I appealed to M. Urbain Gohier, the French
writer whose authority on this subject is the greatest, and
I append the reply which he very kindly sent me:</p>

<div class="center">[<i>Translation.</i>]</div>

<div class="right"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>April 8, 1899</i>.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Subjoined are the chief items of the budget for
<i>pay</i>&mdash;which is the same in all branches of the service so
far as officers are concerned.</p>

<p>As to the average cost of the soldier for maintenance,
food, &amp;c., it is impossible to arrive at it.</p>

<p>Figures have been given from time to time, but they
are purely imaginary.</p>

<p>Expenses of all kinds are scattered under twenty different
headings in our budget, and the Reporter-General
for that of 1899 has announced that nobody, either at the
War Office or in Parliament, can accurately dissect the
expenditure.</p>

<p>The actual pay&mdash;of which I give you the amounts&mdash;is
in practice augmented by a mass of "indemnities,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>so-called, for residence, travelling, mustering, lodging, high
price of food, office expenses, maintenance of dignity, first
equipment, &amp;c., varying with the nature of the employment,
and the individuals employed.</p>

<p>Some officers draw their bare pay, whilst others make
a large income, of which no official trace can anywhere be
found.</p>

<p>Similarly, in the case of the men: the cost of provisions,
firing, lighting, sleeping accommodation, medical treatment
in or out of hospital, is reckoned in a lump sum, without
distinction between different branches of the service.</p>

<p>I leave to M. Gohier the whole responsibility for these
statements, as I am not in a position to test their
correctness. I may add, however, that French officers,
whatever their faults, have always seemed to me remarkably
straightforward in money matters, and even M. Gohier&mdash;whom
I cannot follow in his virulent attacks upon all
officers indiscriminately&mdash;has never even hinted that any
of them enrich themselves by dishonourable means.</p>

<p>Accused persons are examined by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Juge d'instruction</i>
(examining magistrate) <i>in camera</i>. Prisoners are considered
guilty until they can prove their innocence. The examining
magistrate can use any means he likes to obtain a confession;
he can send a prisoner to solitary confinement
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au secret</i>) for weeks, if he chooses. He collects all information
respecting the prisoner, bewilders him, lies to
him if he thinks fit, and can keep him for months in
confinement, before committing him for trial or releasing
him.</p>

<p>In most of the cases which would be disposed of in
England by a Police Magistrate, within twenty-four hours
of arrest, the accused is kept, in France, for a period of
from one to three months under lock and key, before being
tried by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Police Correctionnelle</i> (Police Court), and in
case of crimes which have to be tried by a jury the preliminary
inquiry or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">instruction</i> lasts from three to <i>eighteen</i>
months. Three or four years ago in one of the celebrated
cases which ended in an acquittal, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">instruction</i> of the
case lasted eighteen months, during the whole of which
time the accused was kept in prison, being for a considerable
period in the strictest solitary confinement.</p>

<p>It is only during the last two years that a new law has
been passed, enabling accused persons to be assisted by
counsel during the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">instruction</i>&mdash;counsel being present
during the examination of the accused. Formerly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
accused was not allowed to be assisted by counsel until
the examination was closed.</p>

<p>As I said before, bail does not exist in France, except
in rare instances with the approval of the Minister for
Justice. In such cases bail takes the form of a deposit
in cash, usually amounting to many hundreds or even
thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Juge d'instruction</i> can, however, release a prisoner
off hand, or grant him provisional liberty, but this is also
very rarely done.</p>

<p>Limitation in the case of criminal offences, however,
exists in France. For offences which entail a maximum
punishment of five years' imprisonment, no prosecution
can take place after a lapse of three years from the date
of the commission of the crime.</p>

<p>In the case of felonies (even in the case of murder), no
prosecution can take place after thirty years have elapsed
since the crime was committed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a citizen is accused of any crime
or felony, and he absconds, he can be tried and sentenced
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par contumace</i> in his absence.</p>

<p><i>The Academy.</i>&mdash;"A really excellent budget of information about
Army life in all its aspects. We can cordially recommend it to all who
take a personal or patriotic interest in the army."</p>

<p><i>The Daily Mail.</i>&mdash;"A particularly interesting and instructive book
about army life in its varied aspects. Even Mr. Kipling may learn a
great deal from these enlightening pages."</p>

<p><i>The Daily Telegraph.</i>&mdash;"The book is full of excellent suggestions
on matters both great and small, and should prove of much interest to
the general public. Mr. Wyndham gives a bright and amusing as well
as a faithful record, and he renders a real service in bringing home to
us the daily life of the men in the Queen's service."</p>

<p><i>The Spectator.</i>&mdash;"As a description of a phase of existence very
little known outside the Army itself, and in its inner details only
vaguely surmised even by the most careful officers, we think it ought
to be very interesting to many readers both inside and outside the
Army. In all his views the author is wholesome, sane, and intelligent.
His discussion of the position of gentlemen in the ranks, and
scornful repudiation of the idea of a 'regiment of gentlemen,' are both
interesting."</p>

<p><i>The Speaker.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Wyndham's book has, in a high degree, the
qualities of truthfulness and modesty; the author makes it his business
to tell an unvarnished tale, to put life itself upon the page; and we
may safely say that the result of his endeavour is a narrative which can
be neglected by no judicious writer upon the subject of life in the
British Army during recent years."</p>

<p><i>The Pall Mall Gazette.</i>&mdash;"Life as a soldier has been described
several times before, but never with such effect as in this handy and
interesting volume. The interesting matter and common sense contained
therein thoroughly recommend it to all interested in the welfare
of the Army."</p>

<p><i>Literature.</i>&mdash;"It is to Mr. Wyndham's advantage that he is
throughout in perfect touch with his subject, instead of treating it from
the <i>olim meminisse</i> standpoint, which is generally misleading and
sometimes insincere. Another point in his favour is that he is up-to-date.
His work, as a whole, will probably hold good for some years to
come, as not only a readable narrative but also a substantially accurate
work of reference."</p>

<p><i>The Outlook.</i>&mdash;"No one interested in the contemporary condition
or in the future amelioration of the British Army can neglect such a
book as this, for it affords a remarkable glimpse of military life at the
very bottom of the ladder. It is, moreover, both lucid and temperate."</p>

<p><i>The World.</i>&mdash;"Gives one a very good notion of the soldier's life at
Aldershot, the Curragh, or Gib.&mdash;cleaning, drilling, feeding, mounting
guard&mdash;a life which is so like that of the ordinary housemaid, until the
guns begin to shoot. The private's grievances are set forth moderately
and convincingly. Mr. Wyndham's book, giving the soldier's view,
should point the way to those whose pressing duty it is to make
military service more popular."</p>

<p><i>The Nottingham Guardian.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Wyndham is gifted with no
inconsiderable power of observation, and writes in a style at once
forcible and agreeable. He gives remarkably graphic pictures of life
in barracks and in camp, and criticises with the freedom of one who
has made the subject a speciality."</p>

<p><i>The Review of Reviews.</i>&mdash;"All imaginative pictures drawn by
authors in an attempt to depict war as it really is sink into insignificance
beside this actual record of a soldier's daily experience in the
rearguard of the Army of Moscow. The Peace Societies could desire
no more effective literature, and, if they are wise, will do all they can
to promote the sale of this book."</p>

<p><i>The Times.</i>&mdash;"A vivid narrative of Napoleon's ill-starred Russian
campaign as viewed from the ranks. Bourgogne was a shrewd soldier,
imbued with the national worship of Napoleon, experienced in the wars
of the Empire, and endowed with a rare narrative power. The
dramatic and tragic incidents with which his pages abound are full of
attraction."</p>

<p><i>The Pall Mall Gazette.</i>&mdash;"Bourgogne is, so to speak, the small-change
for De Ségur&mdash;the vernacular of that classic. The Brigadier-General
on the Staff tells you what the retreat from Moscow looked
like. The Sergeant of the Guard was in a position to tell you what it
felt like. Moreover, the Sergeant happens to be an impressionist of
the convincing sort. He not only makes you see what he saw, but he
perfectly persuades you that he saw it. So it is that the true inwardness
of the ghastly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débacle</i> is shown up to you with a new vividness by the
ingenuous sidelights this literary non-com. has cast upon it."</p>

<p><i>The Morning Post.</i>&mdash;"These Memoirs are well written, full of
interest, and abound in dramatic situations. They have, moreover, the
recommendation of being admirably rendered into English, and read
almost like an English work."</p>

<p><i>Literature.</i>&mdash;"Ségur tells the story of the disastrous retreat from the
officer's point of view. Now we have the narrative of the soldier in the
ranks. Ségur was a man of culture. Bourgogne was not always sure
of his spelling. Yet the sergeant's story is the more vivid of the two.
He was no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</i>, yet his book, for intensity of feeling, minuteness
of description, even lucidity of style, will vie with any romance of war."</p>

<p><i>The Illustrated London News.</i>&mdash;"No adventure-story ever written
approaches in interest the appalling account of the retreat from Moscow
given by Sergeant Bourgogne in his Memoirs. Poe himself could not
invent horrors more ghastly, nor describe them more graphically."</p>

<p><i>The Daily Chronicle.</i>&mdash;"Verily this is a human document of the
most terrible and engrossing kind we ever remember to have come
across. The annals of war are rich in tales of disaster and suffering, but
in none so dreadful as this story of the retreat of Napoleon's Grand
Army from Moscow. Sergeant Bourgogne has left us a record, of the
campaign from the point of view of the common soldier which must
rank as an unconscious masterpiece of naïve and touching war-chronicling
and characterisation. His narrative bears the hall-mark of
veracity and vivid realism. No romancer could possibly have served up
such a gruesome dish of military horrors as has now been placed before
us by Sergeant Bourgogne. Even Nansen in his 'Farthest North'
pales in interest before the frosts, the snows, and the cruel winds of this
non-commissioned Xenophon of the Imperial Guard. We can heartily
recommend this book as one of the most appalling, and at times
pathetic, pictures of the horrors of war that was ever penned."</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
