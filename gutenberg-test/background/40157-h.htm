<p class="justify">or the following description of
the American mink I am indebted
to the Encyclopædia
Britannica:</p>

<p class="blkquot">"In size it much resembles the English
polecat&mdash;the length of the head and body being
usually from fifteen to eighteen inches; that of
the tail to the end of the hair about nine inches.
The female is considerably smaller than the
male. The tail is bushy, but tapering at the
end. The ears are small, low, rounded, and
scarcely project beyond the adjacent fur. The
pelage consists of a dense, soft, matted under-fur,
mixed with long, stiff, lustrous hairs on all
parts of the body and tail. The gloss is greatest
on the upper parts; on the tail the bristly
hairs predominate. Northern specimens have
the finest and most glistening pelage; in those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
from the southern regions there is less difference
between the under- and over-fur, and the
whole pelage is coarser and harsher. In color,
different specimens present a considerable
range of variation, but the animal is ordinarily
of a rich, dark brown, scarcely or not paler below
than on the general upper parts; but the
back is usually the darkest, and the tail is nearly
black. The under jaw, from the chin about
as far back as the angle of the mouth, is generally
white. In the European mink the upper
lip is also white, but, as this occasionally occurs
in American specimens, it fails as an absolutely
distinguishing character. Besides the white on
the chin, there are often other irregular white
patches on the under parts of the body. In very
rare instances the tail is tipped with white. The
fur, like that of most of the animals of the group to
which it belongs, is an important article of
commerce."</p>

</div>
<p class="justify">he fur market has always been a
good market. It has grown
firmer and stronger from year to
year, while the prices for furs have been
advancing steadily and rapidly with the
growing demand for furs in Europe and
America, and with the general increasing
scarcity of all fur-bearing animals.
Mink fur advanced about fifty per cent.
during the last two seasons, and there is
every reason to believe that the mink
fur in Louisiana will advance to about
six dollars within the coming three
years. The minks caught in Louisiana
last season were sold at an average
price of three dollars.</p>

</div>
<p class="justify">ur-bearing animals are becoming
scarce where they were
once so plentiful, and, like the
buffaloes that roamed this country in
such great numbers, they will soon,
many of them, become extinct if
the present rate of trapping continues
to obtain in America. Already
certain fur animals are almost trapped
out and are rare. Even the alligator,
which was so plentiful a few years ago
in the swamps of Louisiana, is hardly
sought after any more for its hide because
of its scarcity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The laws enacted by the various
State legislatures for the protection of
fur-bearing animals, in fact, offer no protection;
for most furs caught out of season
have no market value, and for that
reason are not caught.</p>

<p>In Louisiana a trapper has to procure
a hunting license if he wishes to carry a
gun while trapping, which license costs
only one dollar and is good for one season
only. Such a low license, while it
may bring a large revenue to the State,
clearly has no element of protection in
it. On the contrary, it is a truth that it
stimulates both hunting and trapping, as
there were more trappers in Louisiana
last season than before the law requiring
this license came into effect. Every
trapper procures a hunting license whether
he carries a gun or not, and most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
trappers believe the law requires them
to have this license to trap.</p>

<p>Whatever is being done for the
protection of fur-bearing animals in
Louisiana, the fact remains that they
are fast disappearing. Old and experienced
trappers will tell you that minks
were very difficult to trap last season as
compared with the seasons of a few
years ago, when they could be so easily
trapped in dead-falls. Raccoons, too,
which were so numerous in the rear of
old cornfields during the trapping seasons,
have diminished at a surprising
rate within the last three years.</p>

<div class="fig_center">

<p class="fig_caption">A Female of Two Years.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>While laws are being adopted by
different States for the regulation of
trapping to protect fur-bearing animals,
it is time for those who expect to make
money with fur in the future to begin
raising their own animals. The time is
almost here when trapping will be
unprofitable. Fur animals will be too
scarce to make anything at it. Then
people will have to build farms in which
to breed minks for their fur, and mink
farms will become common. Minks are
the most valuable fur-bearing animals in
Louisiana, being the most numerous, and
they are also the easiest and most profitable
to breed for their fur.</p>

<p>Breeding minks in Louisiana for
their fur can be made a very profitable
industry. There is more to be made at
it than raising horses, hogs or cattle.
After a farm is once completed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
stocked, all expense is about over if
there is a large-enough pond in it to
supply the minks with sufficient food.
Under the present condition of the fur
market, each female will average a profit
of forty dollars a year. A farm stocked
for the first time during the winter with
five hundred female minks should bring
its owner the following winter approximately
twenty thousand dollars. This
is figured at three dollars a fur; but
within three years the mink fur in
Louisiana should be selling for what
the mink fur in the North sold last
season. With this increase in the price
of fur, a farm stocked with the same
number should bring forty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Minks require little room, and
thousands can be raised each year on
a farm of ten acres. The larger the
farm, however, the better chances they
will have to procure food for themselves,
as birds will enter a large farm more
freely than a small one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>For this reason, in building a mink
farm the first and most important requirement
is a good location. A small island
consisting of low land covered with trees
and grasses, with the opposite shore at
least three-quarters of a mile distant,
would make an excellent farm, provided
the surrounding water supplies an abundance
of small fishes. Such an island
would, of course, preclude the necessity
of using material for holding the minks
in captivity. If a suitable island cannot
be found, a good farm can be made
with five or more acres of low swampy
land having a natural growth of trees,
grasses and underbrush, such as can be
found in Southern Louisiana. But the
piece of land selected for a farm must
inclose a large pond, or several small
ponds, containing a good quantity of
small fishes, especially crayfish. The
trees and grasses will attract birds,
which, in addition to fish and rabbits,
form a large part of food for the
minks.</p>

<p>Feeding minks is pretty costly, and
is hardly to be considered by one entering
the business of breeding them for
their fur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>The walls surrounding a mink farm
can be made either with bricks or with
sheets of corrugated, galvanized iron.
The latter material makes an excellent
wall, and costs less than a brick wall.
It should be used in sheets measuring
twelve feet in length by about twenty-six
inches in width. These sheets
should be used in an upright position,
and at least five feet should be underground
and seven feet aboveground.
They should be allowed to lap two
inches, and the dirt should be firmly
packed against them. Two rows of
wooden strips nailed on the outside of
the wall, one about two feet above the
ground, and the other along the top
edge of the sheets, will greatly strengthen
the wall and also prevent the wind from
shaking it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The <a href="#i035">following photograph</a> shows a
small pentagonal farm, the walls of
which are made with sheets of corrugated,
galvanized iron. Each side
measures sixteen feet in length, extending
four feet underground and four feet
aboveground. Wire netting is used to
cover the farm, not to prevent the minks
from jumping over, although the walls
are too low, but to prevent chickens,
cats and buzzards from entering and eating
the food put in for the minks. A
wooden shed also covers a part of the
small farm and serves to keep out some
of the rain and heat, there being no
shrubs or trees therein. There are two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
small troughs in the ground for holding
water, and in the center of the farm
there is a place for the minks to live
during the day, which consists of boards
laid five inches above the surface of the
ground with about fourteen inches of
dirt on top. Under these boards it is
dark during the day and always damp
and cool. There are also several barrels
in this farm filled with corn shucks
and hay for the minks to enter during
cold weather. The minks in this little
farm are fed with the spleen of cattle,
different meats, crayfish and other small
fishes. The cost of this farm, or pen,
which has been used for experimental
purposes only, amounts to approximately
forty-two dollars. It is large
enough to raise two hundred minks if
they are properly fed and cared for.</p>

<p>Sometimes an island can be used
for a farm even when it has opposite
shores or islands within two hundred
feet or less, provided the water surrounding
it has an average depth of from four
to six feet. In such a case, the walls
inclosing the island should be built in
the water at a distance of fifty or one
hundred feet from its shores. Sheets of
metal should be used, as previously
described, by placing them upright in
the water and nailing them together
with strips running along the outside.
It is not essential that the lower wall
should be in the ground or even touching
it; posts can be driven in the ground
to strengthen the wall, or to support it
entirely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>In a small farm where minks are in
close captivity and have to be fed, the
old ones used for the purpose of stocking
it will at first do considerable digging
near the walls. They will dig into
loose earth to a depth ranging from a
few inches to three feet in their attempts
to liberate themselves. But they will
cease to dig after they have been in
captivity for about four months. Those
born in a farm will not dig or try to get
out. They will climb, however, to a
height of fifteen feet on reclining trees
or on bushes, and for this reason all
trees, bushes and pieces of lumber should
be removed from the inside of the walls
before any minks are turned loose in a
farm. They will ordinarily jump to a
height of four feet. They can climb
wooden walls as swiftly as a cat, or any
wall made of soft material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>The <a href="#i051">following sketch</a> shows the very
best mink farm that can be made. It
requires a rectangular piece of land of
five or ten acres, running along and
separated by a large bayou in the
swamps of Louisiana. Covering this
land there should be the necessary
trees, shrubbery and grasses. The walls
are built along the bayou about one
hundred feet from the middle, and
extend underground to a depth of six
feet. The walls at the ends of the
farm where they cross the bayou should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
be very carefully constructed. At these
places where the walls cross the bayou
should have a depth of at least twelve
feet or more, so that the walls can be
made to extend nine feet below the
water surface for one-third the width of
the stream and still have sufficient openings
below the walls to permit the water
to flow through freely. For example,
if the bayou is fifty feet wide, fifteen
feet of the wall crossing it can be elevated
so that there will be a large-enough
opening below for the water to
flow. The remaining portion of the
wall (that lying near the shore) should
be driven in the ground for about one
foot, as minks will not dig under water.
A farm of five acres, similar to the one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
just described, would cost, completed,
approximately eight hundred dollars.
The minks in such a farm, owing to the
continuous change of water in the bayou,
would always have an abundance of
food. The banks of the bayou would
afford a natural breeding-place, as minks
usually burrow in the banks of small
streams or along canals and have their
young near the water. If the water in
the bayou falls, wire netting could be
used over the opening at the ends below
the walls.</p>

<p class="justify">inks in Louisiana have two
litters a season, the number of
young in each brood varying from four
to eight. Sometimes, however, but very
rarely, there will be only two in a brood,
and almost as infrequently, on the other
hand, there will be three litters a season
instead of two. Captive animals breed
more profusely than the wild, and will
occasionally have three litters where
they are in close captivity. They begin
to breed when they are about one year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
old, and in captivity will raise an average
of fourteen a year. Normally, they
live to be about nine years old, but they
will live longer in captivity where they
are well treated and given all the water
and the different foods required by
them.</p>

<p>Like all other industries, the business
of breeding minks for their fur
necessitates an outlay of capital. A
farm cannot be built without money,
and the cost of one sufficiently large to
breed minks profitably ranges from five
hundred to a thousand dollars. Of
course, a farm can be made any size and
costing any amount of money; but large
farms are not necessary, and it is much
better to have several small farms of six
or ten acres than one very large one.</p>

<p>After a farm is completed it has to
be stocked, and the task is no easy or
inexpensive one. Trappers will have to
be employed to trap minks with No. 1
steel traps, as these small traps do not
injure them very much unless they are

<p>The author intends to organize a
company styled the "Louisiana Mink
Company," the objects and purposes of
which shall be to build mink farms and
to breed minks in this State for their fur.</p>

<p>No matter what capital is involved,
or expense incurred, in entering into the
business of breeding minks for their fur,
the returns will be so big that this will
appear small in comparison. And those
who are so fortunate as to start in the
industry now will, when minks will have
become so rare that trapping will be unprofitable,
and the demand so great that
the prices for mink fur will soar higher
and higher&mdash;those persons, I say, of foresight,
who had the good fortune to start
in the business early, will reap each year
the steady advances in the price of mink
fur, and be able, in a word, to command
the fur market of both Europe and
America.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
