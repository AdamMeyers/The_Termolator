<h2>A DAY WITH BYRON.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="noindent"><img class="left" src="images/dropo.png" height="120" alt="O" title="" />ne February afternoon in the
year 1822, about two o'clock,&mdash;for
this is the hour at which his
day begins,&mdash;"the most notorious
personality of his century"
arouses himself, in the Palazzo
Lanfranchi at Pisa. George
Gordon Noel, Lord Byron, languidly arises
and dresses, with the assistance of his devoted
valet Fletcher. Invariably he awakes in very
low spirits, "in actual despair and despondency,"
he has termed it: this is in part constitutional,
and partly, no doubt, a reaction after the
feverish brain-work of the previous night. It
is, at any rate, in unutterable melancholy and
<i>ennui</i> that he surveys in the mirror that slight
and graceful form, which had been idolised by
London drawing-rooms, and that pale, scornful,
beautiful face, "like a spirit, good or evil,"
which the enthusiastic Walter Scott has termed
a thing to dream of. He notes the grey streaks
already visible among his dark brown locks, and
mutters his own lines miserably to himself,&mdash;

</div>

<p class="noindent">An innumerable motley crowd of reminiscences&mdash;most
of them bitter, sorrowful, or contemptuous,
throng across his mind, shaping themselves
into poignant verse:</p>

<div class="center">
<table style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">

<tr><td align="left">So, 'midst the wither'd waste of life, those tears would flow to me.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A meagre breakfast,&mdash;of claret and soda with a
few mouthfuls of some Italian dish,&mdash;somewhat
restores his natural vivacity: and he listens
with cynical amusement to Fletcher's blood-curdling
stories of the phantoms who have made
night hideous. For the famous old feudal
Palazzo, with its dungeons and secret chambers,
has been immemorially  infested with ghosts,
and harassed by inexplicable noises. Fletcher
has already begged leave to change his room,
and then refused to occupy his new room,
because, as his master reports, "there are more
ghosts there than in the other!&hellip; There
is one place where people were evidently
walled up.&hellip; I am bothered about these
spectres, as they say the last occupants were
too." However, he is laughing as he descends
the magnificent staircase,&mdash;the reputed work
of Michael Angelo,&mdash;laughing until the shrill
querulous cries of peevish children make him
stop and frown. He has allowed the Leigh
Hunts, with their large and fractious family, to
occupy for the present the ground-floor of the
Palazzo; and children are his pet abhorrence.
"I abominate the sight of them so much," he
has already told Moore, "that I have always
had the greatest respect for the character of
Herod!" No child figures in any of his poems:
his own paternal feeling towards "Ada, sole
daughter of my house and home," is merely a
fluctuating sentiment.</p>

<p>He shrugs his shoulders and enters his great
<i>salon</i>, again moody and with a downcast air:
and throws himself upon a couch in gloomy
reverie. Snatches of poetry wander through
his thoughts&mdash;poetry intrinsically autobiographical,
for "the inequalities of his style are
those of his career," and his imaginary heroes
are endless reproductions of himself, "the
wandering outlaw of his own dark mind." He
has drawn his own picture more effectively in
<i>Lara</i> than any strange hand could do.</p>

<div class="center">
<table style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="2" summary="poem">

<tr><td align="left">Much to be loved and hated, sought and fear'd;</td></tr>

<p class="noindent">His men, in short, as has been observed, are
"made after his own image, and his women
after his own heart." Yet the inveterate family
likeness of these heroes is not shared by the
heroines of his romantic stanzas: for Byron
has an eclectic taste in beauty. One can hardly
imagine a wider dissimilarity than between the
<i>Bride of Abydos</i>, the gentle Zuleika, with her

<p class="noindent">and "Circassia's daughter," the stately Leila of
<i>The Giaour</i>, whose black and flowing hair "swept
the marble where her feet gleamed whiter
than the mountain sleet." Or, if the reader seek
a further choice, there is Medora, beloved of
the Corsair,&mdash;Medora of the deep blue eye and
long fair hair; or the nameless Eastern maiden
of the <i>Hebrew Melodies</i>:</p>

<p>Yet all these heroines are alike in one respect&mdash;their
potentiality of passionate emotion:
since Byron's "passions and his powers,"
according to his intense admirer Shelley, "are
incomparably greater than those of other men:"
and he has used the last almost recklessly in
portrayal of the first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the poet reclines in sombre meditation,
his reverie is broken by the not unwelcome
entrance of his friends&mdash;who may be better
termed his intimate acquaintances. For, to that
brooding, introspective spirit,&mdash;constitutionally
shy, and morbidly conscious of the fact,&mdash;"friendship
is a propensity," he has declared,
"to which my genius is very limited. I do not
know the <i>male</i> human being, except Lord Clare,
the friend of my infancy, for whom I feel anything
that deserves the name. All my others
are men-of-the-world friendships." Be that as
it may, it is with a warmly cordial expression,
and with that peculiarly sweet smile of his, that
Byron welcomes his usual visitors,&mdash;Captain
Williams, Captain Medwin, Taafe the Irishman,
and Percy Bysshe Shelley, "the most companionable
person under thirty," he has avowed,
"that ever I knew." When they have discussed
the latest little Pisan <i>on dits</i>, and the progress
of Shelley's boat-building, the conversation
trends more and more towards literary topics:
personal topics, be it understood, for Byron
is not an omnivorous reader like Shelley.
Williams and Medwin, themselves dabblers in
verse and prose, listen with respectful admiration
to the <i>dicta</i> of the great poets exchanging
views. The low, clear, harmonious voice of
Byron "is a sort of intoxication: men are held
by it as under a spell." He makes no secret of
his open contempt for the professional writing
fraternity. "Who would write, if he had anything
better to do?" he scornfully enquires, "I
think the mighty stir made about scribbling and
scribes, by themselves  and  others, a sign of
effeminacy, degeneracy, and weakness."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shelley, whose assiduous studies in literature
have led him to quite other conclusions,
defends his craft with ardour. But Byron's
chief successes have been too lightly won. He
who wrote the <i>Corsair</i> in ten days, the <i>Bride of
Abydos</i> in four, and <i>Lara</i> whilst undressing after
balls and masquerades, cannot be expected to
take a very serious view of poetry as the one
business of a lifetime. "I by no means rank
poetry or poets," says he, "high in the scale
of imagination. Poetry is the lava of the imagination,
whose eruption prevents an earthquake.
If I live ten years longer," he adds
prophetically, "you will see that all is not
over with me,&mdash;I don't mean in literature,
for that is nothing, and, it may seem odd
enough to say, I don't think it's my vocation.
But you will see that I shall do <i>something</i> or
other!"</p>

<p>This contemner of poesy, however, is soon
persuaded, without much difficulty, to read
aloud some excerpts from his new poems in
process of completion: and very well he reads
them. The listeners are moved to smiles by
the bitter humour of the <i>Vision of Judgment</i>:
they are left half breathless by the impetuous
vigour of <i>Heaven and Earth</i>. But a murmur of
unfeigned applause punctuates the second canto
of <i>Don Juan</i>, with its exquisite presentment of
youth, love, and ecstasy in the persons of Juan
and Haid&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Byron's restless spirit, perpetually eager
to express itself in action, now makes him
anxious to dismiss intellectual discussions: and
he hastily proposes a game of billiards. As he
moves around the billiard-table, his lameness is
distinctly noticeable: not all the ingenuity of
his tailor, nor his own efforts to walk naturally,
can conceal it. Yet, as has been said of him in
other matters, he redeems all his defects by his
graces. And his companions note with surprise
the remarkable change for the better which has
taken place in him since, a few months before,
he arrived at this old palace on the Arno with
a troop of servants, carriages, horses, fowls,
dogs, and monkeys. The selfish and sensual
Byron of Venetian days is entirely a thing of
the past. "He is improved in every respect,"&mdash;says
Shelley to Williams, "in genius, in temper,
in moral views, in health and happiness." And
although keeping up a certain splendour upon
an income of &pound;4000 a year, he devotes &pound;1000 of
that income entirely to purposes of charity.
His own personal needs are of the simplest.</p>

<p>The game concluded, Byron's carriage is
announced: his friends and he proceed in it as
far as the town gates of Pisa, by this means to
avoid the starers of the streets. Horses are
in readiness at the gates: the company,
with one or two servant-men, mount and ride
into the pine-forest that reaches towards the
sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Byron is as excellent and graceful a rider
as a swimmer, with remarkable powers of endurance.
He can cover seventy or eighty miles
a day, fast going, and swim five miles at a stretch:
he is indeed, in many respects, the typical open-air
Englishman. But to-day he rides slowly
and immersed in thought. As his wife years
since assured him, he is at heart the most
melancholy of mankind, often when apparently
the gayest. His abnormally long sight takes in
every detail of the scenery,&mdash;storing it up unconsciously
for future reference. It has been
said that Byron is nothing without his descriptions:
and in these he has achieved some of his
finest work: notably in some immortal stanzas
of <i>Childe Harold</i>, with their dazzling panoramic
succession of vivid scenes: whether depicting
how</p>

<p>Byron is emphatically a citizen of the world,
who has "not only painted the environs, but
reflected the passions and aspirations of every
scene which he visualizes." And it is this
magic power of conveying the authentic impression
of an actual occurrence, which renders
his most recondite situations so thrilling,&mdash;which
breathes a Western vigour into the scented air
of the Orient, and thrills with poignant pathos
through the horrors of the <i>Prisoner of Chillon</i>.</p>

<p>Unhappily, all these shifting scenes of imagination
or experience&mdash;so the poet has made
mournful confession&mdash;have little power to wean
him from himself. "Neither the music of the
shepherd, the crashing of the avalanche, nor
the torrent, the mountain, the glacier, the forest,
nor the cloud, have for one moment lightened
the weight upon my heart, nor enabled me to
lose my own wretched identity in the majesty,
and the power, and the glory, above, around,
and beneath me."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And although, it will be noticed, he exempts
the sea&mdash;and although the blood of old sea-kings,
running fiercely in his veins, still kindles him to
imperishable rapture in its presence,&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;yet there is sorrow on the sea itself,&mdash;the
"unplumb'd, salt, estranging sea" which separates
him from his mother-country. Cosmopolitan
as he is, self-banished exile, quick with
Greek and Italian sympathies, Byron never for
one moment forgets that he is head of one of
England's proudest families. Despite his
scathing scorn towards his fair-weather London
friends, towards the unreasoning outbursts of
malignity which drove him out of his England&mdash;with
all her faults, he loves her still. He
vaguely hopes and hankers after a return to
those long-lost shores: and endeavours to believe
that the future will in some way make atonement
for all the calamities of the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now Shelley, Williams, Medwin, and
Taafe are dismounting in the pine forest, and
the men-servants setting up the target. Pistol-practice
is Byron's forte; when he hits a half-crown
at twelve yards he is as delighted as a
boy, and quite glum and disconcerted if he
should happen to miss. This very rarely
happens, as he is a crack shot, easily distancing
the other competitors. His hand trembles
violently, but he calculates on this vibration,
and, depending entirely on his eye, hardly ever
fails. After about an hour's shooting, the light
begins to wane towards sunset: and the friends
ride back to the city, Byron in exuberant
good humour with himself and everybody else.
Arrived at the Palazzo Lanfranchi, he finds
two guests awaiting him,&mdash;Count Pietro Gamba,
brother of the lovely Contessa Guiccioli, and
Trelawny, that handsome, picturesque, piratical-looking
"Younger Son," who has not yet
published to an astonished world his remarkable
and almost incredible "Adventures."
Trelawny is at present in command of Byron's
yacht the <i>Bolivar</i>, lying in the harbour of
Genoa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poet welcomes these new additions to
his company: for, since his arrival in Pisa, he
has begun to entertain men at dinner-parties,
for the first time since leaving England. A
very cheerful company sits down with him to
dinner: their host displays himself to great
advantage, "being at once," to quote Shelley,
"polite and cordial, full of social hilarity and
the most perfect good humour, never diverging
into ungraceful merriment, and yet keeping up
the spirit of liveliness throughout the evening."
Byron, according to his own declaration, has
never passed two hours in mixed society without
wishing himself out of it again. Nobody,
however, could guess at this fact from his bright,
frank, and spontaneous gaiety. Always an
abstemious eater&mdash;"I have fed at times for
over two months together," he assures his
friends, "on sheer biscuit and water,"&mdash;very
little food suffices him: and besides, <i>bien entendu</i>,
he is anxious to retain that "happy slenderness"
on which he prides himself,&mdash;the slenderness
which is a characteristic of his family, and which
he has recently endangered by a lazy life in
Venice. The guests sit fascinated by his enthralling
personality: they recognize that he
wears a natural greatness which "his errors
can only half obscure:" and they rivet their
gaze upon that pale and splendid face, the only
one, as Scott says, that ever came up to an
artist's notion of what the lineaments of a poet
should be. He looks around him upon the
ethereal and feminine countenance of Shelley,
the visionary,&mdash;the kind, pleasant, honest
English faces of Medwin and Williams,&mdash;the
good-looking Italian Gamba, the quaint little
Irishman Taafe,&mdash;last, not least, the dark
mustachios and wildly-flashing Celtic eyes of the
Cornish adventurer Trelawny. This latter
might well have served for a model of Conrad
the Corsair: and so he is assured by his companions.</p>

hastily turns the current of conversation towards
more impersonal subjects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evening wears on: the guests depart:
the clear spring moonlight streams upon the
winding Arno. Byron stands dreaming at the
open window, the bridges and buildings of Pisa
lie still and silver-lit before him: a subtle influence
of quietude steals down upon him from
the stars. "What nothings we are," he
murmurs, "before the least of these stars!" One
in particular&mdash;is it Sirius?&mdash;entrances his
attention with its cold refulgence of pure light.
His thoughts involuntarily shape themselves in
rhythm and rhyme;</p>

<p>It is the hour when Byron's brain becomes
thronged with a glowing phantasmagoria of
ideas that cry aloud for visible expression. He
forgets, under the stress of creative impulse,
the sources and causes of his inherent melancholy,&mdash;the
miserable days of his childhood,
with a Fury for a mother,&mdash;the wound, never
to be healed, of his unrequited love for Mary
Chaworth,&mdash;the inimical wife from whom he is
eternally alienated,&mdash;the little daughter that he
may never hold in his arms,&mdash;the beloved sister
separated from his side,&mdash;the ancestral home of
his forefathers now passed into a stranger's
hold,&mdash;the meteoric glory and total eclipse of
his unparalleled popularity in England,&mdash;the
follies, and worse than follies, which have made
him what he is, "consistent in nothing but his
passion and his pride." These memories, like
poisonous exhalations, are banished from his
mind, and leave a clear horizon for a while,&mdash;a
fertile landscape peopled with great words and
images. Something akin to inspiration seizes
upon him: and he throws himself to work
with all the zest and nerve of his impulsive
nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a man who writes, in his own phrase,
"with rapidity and rarely with pains&hellip;.
When I once take pen in hand, I <i>must</i> say
what comes uppermost or fling it away." Not
for him that careful polishing of sentences,
which other writers meticulously bestow. "I
have always written as fast as I could put pen
to paper, and never revised but in the proofs&hellip;.
I can never recast anything. I am like
the tiger; if I miss the first spring, I go grumbling
back to my jungle." And to this impetuous
directness of onslaught, his finest poems
bear witness. Some critic has remarked that
Byron is too much of the earth earthy to be a
great lyrical writer: yet a Promethean fire,
stolen from heaven, burns immortally through
some of his shorter lyrics. In Greek, it is said,
there are 1632 ways of expressing the simple
fact <i>I love you</i>: yet who has ever put it in a
more convincing form than Byron does in <i>Maid
of Athens</i>?</p>

<p>Rapidly as his pen flies over the paper, the
torrent of throbbing thought flows faster still.
Far on into the night, when ghostly noises echo
through the sleeping palace, "that ever-gushing
and perennial fount of natural waters," as Scott
has described the genius of Byron, pours forth
in reckless profusion. Until at last, outspent
with energy, he draws a deep breath of exhaustion,
and realizes that he is weariness itself.
The moon has sunk in Arno: the stars
are half-way across the sky: a cold glimmer
of dawn is palpitating along the East, as

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
