<p class="scene">S<span class="smallerfont">CENE</span> I.—<i>A Drawing Room at Mrs.
Somerton’s; a fire-place at <span class="stage">C.</span> with a bell rope on each side of
it; doors <span class="stage">R.&nbsp;C.</span> and <span class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.</span>;
above the door <span class="stage">R.&nbsp;C.</span> a small window; window <span
class="stage">R.</span>&nbsp;<span class="normal">2</span>&nbsp;<span
class="stage">E.</span>; a clock on the mantel-piece; a work table <span
class="stage">L.</span>, on which is a writing desk; another table in <span
class="stage">C.</span> of the stage, with papers, books, &amp;c. strewed on it; chairs,
&amp;c., &amp;c.; another door at <span class="stage">R.</span>&nbsp;<span
class="normal">2</span>&nbsp;<span class="stage">E.</span> Stage dark. A loud ringing at
door bell heard.</i></p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>outside</i>) Now then, my good friend, a
little quicker, if you please. (<i>enters at door, <span class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.</span>,
in over coat, whiskers, and moustache; he is closely followed by </i>D<span
class="smallerfont">AVID</span><i>, who carries a lantern</i>)</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. But, zur, zur, don’t ye be in such a hurry.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>throwing a hasty look round the room,
then—aside</i>) Come, I’ve effected an entrance, at all events! so far, so well, provided
I’m not compelled to beat a retreat before I’ve accomplished my object. (<i>walks to
various parts of room, examining, &amp;c., &amp;c.</i>)</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. (<i>all this time examining </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> from head to foot with his lantern—aside</i>) Well,
this be about the free and easiest chap I ever cut in with; he almost pulls the gate bell
down to begin with, and when I opens the door—thinking in course it’s missus come home—in
he walks, and without so much as rubbing his boots on the door mat, tells me to light him
up stairs, at four o’clock in the morning, too. (<i>aloud</i>) Who be ye, zur? I know it
don’t become a servant to be inquisitive—so if you’ll only tell me who ye be, what ye be,
why you come here, what you want here, where you come from, and a few other
<i>particklers</i>, I’ll be satisfied and ask no questions.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) I must get rid of this fellow.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. If you want missus, she be gone from home. She
be at a grand ball, and if she finds you here when she comes home, she’ll blow me up in
fine style, as sure as my name’s——</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. David!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. (<i>astonished</i>) He knows my name!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>turning towards </i>D<span
class="smallerfont">AVID</span>) Now hark ye, David. There’s nothing more offensive to me,
David, than familiarity in a servant, David; but in consideration, David, of your having
only recently entered Mrs. Somerton’s service——</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. He knows that, too.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. And you’re being naturally a stupid thick-headed
fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. Dang it, he knows all about me.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. I have no objection to look over it this once,
but the next time it occurs, David, I shall discharge you, David!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. Discharge me! You? (<i>suddenly</i>) Lud a
mercy—in course, I know who ’ee be now!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>alarmed</i>) The devil you do.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. Ees, you be he.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Oh! I’m he, am I?</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. Ees. I should have known ’ee again directly,
only I never seed ’ee before.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) That’s lucky!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. Why missus has been expecting of you the last
three days. It was only just afore she went out she said to me, “David,” said she, “if my
cousin should happen to arrive from London before I get home, show him every attention,”
says she!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) Her cousin, egad! he takes me for
that simpleton Percy Postlethwaite; not very complimentary, perhaps, but decidedly lucky!
(<i>aloud</i>) Yes, David, here I am, at last; and how is Mrs. Somerton?</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. Mrs. Somerton! is that the way you speak of
your cousin? go along, do. (<i>poking </i>R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> in
the side</i>) Ah! Mr. Percy Postlethwaite, you be a lucky young chap to get such a wife, I
can tell ’ee.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) Wife! so, so, Mr. Percy
Postlethwaite, matters are in a more forward state than you led me to believe.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. You’ll find supper all ready for ’ee in the
library, (<i>pointing</i>) so I’ll just light the candles.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. By all means, David. (<i>aside</i>) He does’nt
know me.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. (<i>while lighting the candles</i>) Missus ’ll
be mortal glad to see ’ee, and as for Peggy, she won’t know whether she be standing on her
head or her heels.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. I’m sure I’m very much obliged to Peggy.
(<i>aside</i>) Who’s Peggy?</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. And no wonder; she tells me many’s the time
she’s dangled ’ee on her knee, afore ye were breeched; (<i>imitating</i>) but ye know all
about that.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Of course. I’ve the most distinct recollection of
everything that happened to me before I was breeched.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. (<i>having lighted candles</i>) There, and now
I’ll go down stairs and wait for missus; and as soon as she comes in, I’ll say to
her——</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Not one word, either to her or to Peggy! I wish
to give them both an agreeable surprise, David; you understand, eh?</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. (<i>hesitating</i>) I think I do!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>giving him money</i>) There’s a crown for
you—think again.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. (<i>pocketing money</i>) I’m sure I do! I’ll be
as dumb as an oyster. (<i>going—stops</i>) As I said before, supper be all ready in
t’other room, (<i>going—stops</i>) and if ’ee want anything you needn’t ring for me,
’cause I be going to take a bit of a snooze before the kitchen fire. (<i>yawning</i>) How
sleepy I be to be sure.</p>

<p class="direction_2"><i>Exit at door, </i><span class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>watching </i>D<span
class="smallerfont">AVID</span> <i>out, then goes quickly up and closes the door</i>)
Alone at last—now then to work. (<i>takes a pair of pistols from his coat pocket, which he
places on table</i>) But first, as ladies invariably fly to the bell ropes to raise an
alarm, I must take the liberty of cutting these. (<i>taking knife out of his pocket, and
cutting the bell ropes</i>) Now to examine the means of escape, in case of
interruption—(<i>opening window and looking out</i>)—the garden—a small conservatory
underneath—that’s awkward; but, luckily, there’s an apple tree so conveniently close as to
make a very tolerable ladder on an emergency, so far perfectly satisfactory—and if my
information is only tolerably correct, and it ought to be considering the trouble I’ve had
in obtaining it, (<i>taking small pocket book from his waistcoat and opening it</i>) this
door should lead to Mrs. Somerton’s chamber—(<i>opening door at <span
class="stage">L.</span>, and looking in</i>)—exactly, and very elegantly appointed indeed.
(<i>closes door, and again looking at his pocket book</i>)—“near the door a
table”—precisely—(<i>laying his hand on the table</i>)—“on the table a small writing
desk”—here it is—(<i>laying his hand on the writing desk</i>)—locked, and the key taken
out, that of course I expected; but as I have ascertained that between the hours of 12 and
1 yesterday it became the temporary receptacle of a pocket book containing bank notes to
the amount of fifteen thousand pounds, it is not likely I should come unprovided with the
means of securing such a treasure. (<i>takes out a bunch of small keys, some of which he
tries—produces a chisel from his coat pocket, and is about to insert it under the lid of
the box, a loud ring at gate bell heard</i>) Mrs. Somerton returned. (<i>runs to door,
<span class="stage">L.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.</span>—ring repeated</i>) Again!
Stay—(<i>listening</i>) The window—quick! (<i>runs to window</i>) A man in the garden, and
cautiously making towards this window. Who can he be? and what can be his object? Not the
same as mine surely—egad, that would be comical enough. If I could only observe—— Ah—that
door. (<i>blows out the candle, and gropes his way to door, <span class="stage">R.</span>;
at the moment that he enters the room, <span class="stage">R.</span>, </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span> <i>head is seen
at the window,</i> <span class="stage">R.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.</span>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. I’ve done it! I’ve been ringing at the bell long
enough, so I’ve been obliged to effect an entrance by the window; (<i>putting one leg over
the window sill</i>) and let me observe to the inexperienced in these matters, that the
fact of threading one’s way up a densely wooded apple tree on a pitch dark night is a
gymnastic feat more easily imagined than accomplished. (<i>gets in at window—he has a
carpet bag</i>) However, as I said before, I’ve done it, and what’s more I live to tell
it, though I may be allowed to remark that, considering my cousin, Mrs. Somerton, has been
expecting me—<i>me, her affianced husband—</i>for the last three nights, I think she might
have allowed one of her domestics to sit up for me: however, I’m not going to quarrel with
her, no—no—I cannot forget that she’s my cousin, and the only child of my honoured and
lamented uncle—I mean aunt—no, uncle—and now that the law suit has been decided in her
favour, and that she steps into possession of fifteen thousand pounds, her late husband’s
fortune, I feel that to upbraid her at such a moment would be unmanly.<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span> There’s a spark of fire
left in the grate I declare—that’s lucky! I’ll light a candle if I can find one.
(<i>feeling about</i>) Here’s one—no, it’s a scent bottle—now I’ve got it—(<i>takes
candle, and goes towards fireplace</i>)—and now for a piece of paper. (<i>takes a paper
out of his pocket, and about to tear it</i>) Stop—it won’t do to tear this, this is
yesterday’s Times, in which I find that my friend Captain Ratcliffe has been appointed to
the situation of Chief Superintendent of the Rural Police, of the Western Division of the
County of Kent, and as I know he’s been here at Tunbridge Wells for the last week, I’ve
determined to find him out, and be the first to congratulate him—this’ll do! (<i>taking
another piece of paper, and lighting the candle with it</i>) There—and now—— (<i>seeing a
letter on the table, and taking it up</i>) What’s this? “Colonel Boldwig requests the
honour—Mrs. Somerton’s company—Thursday evening—quadrilles, &amp;c. &amp;c.” Then she’s
not at home; then, egad, I’ll wait for her here—but not in this costume—no, I’ll just
change my coat, et cetera: and, probably, my et cetera requires changing more than my

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>without</i>) Don’t be alarmed, David, I
forgot to say I had taken the latch key with me.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Mrs. Somerton’s voice, and no means of escape!
Then impudence befriend me! (<i>hurries into room, <span class="stage">R.</span></i>)</p>

class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><i> and </i>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span><i> at

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. (<i>who carries a small lantern in her hand,
which she places on table</i>) Dear, dear, how my poor old bones do ache.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>throws off her cloak and hood, and appears
in a handsome ball costume</i>) Now go to bed at once, my good Peggy, I don’t require you
any more.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Yes you do, so sit down there—(<i>making
</i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><i> sit
down on a chair</i>)—and now, while I’m taking all these gimcracks and finery out of your
hair, you shall tell me all about the grand doings at the ball. I warrant me, what the
colonel’s footmen said of you was quite true.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. And pray what did the colonel’s footmen
say?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. They said—— Drat the pin! They said you were
the most beautiful lady in the room—that you had handsomer partners than any lady in the
room.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Yes—to do them, justice, they fairly danced me
off my feet, and yet I am neither grown better tempered, nor better looking, than I was
three months ago, when at a previous party<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span> not one of them condescended to select me for a partner; but
then, on the other hand, I am fifteen thousand pounds richer.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. (<i>suddenly, and giving </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span>’<span
class="smallerfont">S</span><i> hair another jerk</i>) That’s it! Ah, ma’am, these lords
of the creation, as they call themselves, are but a poor mean selfish set after all.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Selfish! No, not all—(<i>sighing</i>)—there is
one at least.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. No! Is there?—he must be quite a curiosity! Oh,
ma’am, who is he?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. It’s a long story, Peggy, and it’s getting
late.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. It’s never too late to hear good news.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Then listen, Peggy. You remember that about
ten months ago I was earnestly advised by my physicians to pay a short visit to the
continent.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Yes; and I remember too that you came home
quite an altered woman—<i>I</i> never saw hair dressed in such an extraordinary
style—never!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Don’t interrupt me. I had been in Paris about
three weeks, when one evening on my return from the opera, I found a note on my dressing
table, containing these words—“I have seen you, and to see you is to love you. I am young,
tolerably handsome, and sufficiently rich, yet as I cannot presume to present myself to
you until you permit me to do so, I shall venture to remind you from time to time that I
am near you.”</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Well I’m sure, Mr. Impudence; and what was the
fellow’s name?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. There was no name, but merely the initials C.
R.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. C. R. Samuel something or other I dare say—but
he gave his address?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. No; simply the words “Post Office, to be left
till called for.” Of course, I took no notice of it whatever, and had forgotten the
circumstance altogether, when a month afterwards to the very day—the very hour—I was then
at Florence, I received a second communication, couched in precisely the same words, and
again subsequently at Venice, Naples, and Milan.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Dear, dear, it’s as good as a play! Then you
never took any notice of the fellow at all?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Yes; a circumstance, the bare recollection of
which makes me shudder even at this lapse of time, compelled me to break through the
silence I had hitherto imposed upon myself: in travelling through Switzerland, on my
return to England, the carriage which I occupied was one night placed in imminent peril by
the restiveness of one of the horses; fortunately, I was asleep, and was not aware of my
danger till I was assured of my safety—within a few feet of a fearful precipice, the
traces had been cut, by a man who had evidently followed me, judge then of my astonishment
when a voice uttered these words in my ear, “You see, madam, I have kept my promise, I am
<i>still near you.</i>”</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Well, he was a fine brave gentleman, whoever he
was; and what was he like—eh?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. He had disappeared before I could even thank
him for his timely and generous assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Well?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Well? (<i>hesitatingly</i>) his next letter,
which reached me shortly after my return to England, did <i>not</i> remain unanswered.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. I should think not, indeed! and what did you
say to Mr. C. R.?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. The truth! that my hand was promised to my
cousin, Percy Postlethwaite; that his father had once saved <i>mine</i> from ruin, who
made me promise, as the only means of testifying <i>his</i> gratitude to the father, to
marry the son.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Ah! and that, of course, was a settler for Mr.
C. R.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. On the contrary, his answer to my letter ran
thus:—“Love like mine never despairs. I will still be near you, for I still hope”—and yet
for the last <i>two months</i> he has ceased to write.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Of course he has! and high time, too,
considering you told him you were Mrs. Postlethwaite, as was to be.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Very true; and yet (<i>after a slight
hesitation</i>) no matter, go to bed, Peggy. Good night.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Good night, ma’am. (<i>taking the
lantern</i>—<i>aside</i>) Luckily when Master Percy arrives he’ll put all this romantic
lackadaisical nonsense out of missus’s head.</p>

<p class="direction_2"><i>Exit at door, </i><span class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.</span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Yes, while the news of my recent accession to
fortune has brought so many admirers to my feet, he, on the contrary, has ceased to think
of me.</p>

<p class="direction_3">(M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. <i>seats herself in chair
near the work table, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>; R<span

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>hearing the noise of the door closing, and

(<i>not receiving an answer, she turns and sees </i>R<span

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<span class="stage">L.</span>) Do not be

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>retreating, and in a tone of alarm which
she endeavours to repress</i>) Who are you, sir? and why this unseasonable intrusion? I
insist on knowing.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. A little patience, my dear madam, and you shall.
(<i>observing </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><i>, who endeavours to reach the door, <span
class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.</span></i>) One moment, madam. Before you summon your servants,
allow me to observe that I shall be under the painful necessity of punishing any one who
presumes to interrupt so delightful a <i>tete à tete.</i> (<i>slowly taking his pistols
from his pocket, and depositing them on the table</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>terrified and aside</i>) He’s armed.
(<i>suddenly</i>) Ah! that writing desk—that large sum of money—(<i>placing herself before
the table on which the writing desk is, and supporting herself with difficulty</i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Now, madam, (<i>crosses to <span
class="stage">R.</span> with chair</i>) the sooner I explain the object of this somewhat
unceremonious visit, the better. Will you allow me to lead you to a chair? (<i>politely
offering his hand to </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><i>, who draws back in alarm</i>) Pray, my dear madam
let me once more entreat you not to be alarmed. (M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>.
S<span class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"

Pray be cautious with those pistols, madam; they are hair triggers, and I perceive the
muzzles are directly pointed towards you. (<i>goes up to the back for a chair</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside and suddenly</i>) If I could but
distinguish his features, so as to be able to recognise him. (<i>hastily runs and brings
candle from the small table at <span class="stage">L.</span>, and places it on table
before her</i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>coming down with the chair, <span
class="stage">R.</span>—stops</i>) You’ll pardon me, madam, but having suffered lately
from a severe cold in my eyes, this excess of light would be positively distressing to me.
(<i>removes the candle to the mantel-piece, <span class="stage">L.</span>; then about to
seat himself opposite to </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span>) Have I your permission, madam? I thank you! (<i>seats
himself</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside</i>) Was there ever such unblushing
effrontery?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Now, madam, I will come to the point at once. I
am in the immediate want of <i>fifteen thousand pounds.</i> (<i>with marked
intention</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside</i>) He knows all.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Which sum, madam, I intend to invest in a
speculation, which promises the most advantageous results.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>with affected unconcern</i>) I cannot
understand, sir, how the subject you allude to can possibly interest me.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. More than you imagine, my dear madam, for I
propose that you shall become my partner in this speculation; in other words, I will find
the industry and energy requisite in carrying it into effect, while you <i>simply have to
provide the money. </i>(<i>with marked emphasis</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>indignantly</i>) Sir!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. That’s all! I’ll therefore make out a receipt for
the amount at once. (<i>taking a piece of paper, and beginning to write</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside, and looking towards the back of the
stage</i>) That bell communicates with David’s room; it is my only hope. (<i>cautiously
rises from her chair, and goes on tiptoe towards the chimney-piece</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>appearing at little window above door at
<span class="stage">R.&nbsp;C.</span></i>) I should very much like to know who has taken
the liberty of locking me in! I repeat, who has taken the liberty of locking me in? I
pause for a reply.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>looking at </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i>, who pretends to be writing, but is watching her
movements—then making a sudden grasp at the bell rope</i>) Ah! the bell rope cut!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>quietly looking up</i>) Yes, true! I quite
forgot to mention that I had taken that <i>little precaution</i> against interruption.
(<i>resumes his writing</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>listening</i>) Holloa! Either cousin Somerton
has got a very bad cold, or she’s not alone!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Here, madam, is the receipt. (<i>rising</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. That’s a man’s voice!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. And now, madam, the necessary forms being
completed<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span> on my
part, all that remains is for you to find the funds; amounting, as I believe I mentioned
before, to the sum of fifteen thousand pounds.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>forcing a laugh</i>) And do you imagine I
could be imprudent enough to keep so large a sum of money——?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. On your person? Oh, dear no; that would be an
indiscretion for which, as your partner, I should certainly take the liberty of scolding
you.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. What’s that? he says he’s my wife’s partner! I
never even knew she was in business.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Until you could deposit it with your banker’s,
you have, doubtless, placed it somewhere under lock and key; but as you seem to have
forgotten the exact locality, I shall be most happy to assist you in your search. Suppose
we begin with the writing desk. (<i>placing his hand on the desk</i>) Will you oblige me
with the key?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. The fellow’s a housebreaker!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. I—I have mislaid or lost it, sir: at least, I
think I have.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Pray <i>think</i> again, my dear madam, as it
would be really a pity to damage so elegant a piece of furniture.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. No—he’s a smasher! It’s lucky for him I can’t get
at him.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>suddenly, and with resolution</i>) Sir,
although alone, and in the power of a desperate man like you, I will not be plundered
except by violence.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. That’s right, cousin—stick to that! She’s a
trump!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>approaching her as she leans against table in
<span class="stage">C.</span>, and in a tone of reproach</i>) Violence to a woman, and
<i>such a woman! </i>(<i>bowing</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Humbug!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. I see you mistake me, madam, I came here to serve
you—to propose to you a safe and profitable investment for your money, but the moment you
object to that proposal—— (<i>taking one of the pistols off the table and playing with
it</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. What’s that he’s got in his hand? (R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> cocks the pistol, the noise of which is distinctly
heard</i>) It’s a blunderbuss! (<i>disappears like lightning, then cautiously appears
again</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>shuddering and sinking into a chair</i>)
You will find the key—in that vase—on the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. That vase, madam? (<i>pointing with his pistol
towards mantel-piece in the direction of </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i>, who again disappears like a shot; </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> goes to the mantel-piece, upon which he deposits
his pistols—then takes key out of the vase, and goes to the writing desk: during this
</i>P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> re-appears cautiously, sees the
pistols, and by leaning very much out of little window, tries to reach them—almost falling
out—disappears; re-appears with the tongs, and again tries to reach the pistols</i>) Ah!
here is a drawer that requires some force to open, doubtless it contains the—— (<i>opening
drawer</i>) No, your diamonds. Ah, madam, I can trace the amiability of your disposition
even in your treatment of these poor jewels—you cease to wear them because their beauty
would be eclipsed by yours. (<i>replacing diamonds in desk</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside, and smiling</i>) To do the wretch
justice he has a certain mode of expressing himself——</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-11">[Pg 11]</a></span>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. I hope he don’t mean to keep on fumbling that
writing desk about much longer, because the bottom of the cane chair has just given way.
Surely, Cousin Somerton never could have been such a simpleton as to lock all her money up
there.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Ah, at last—(<i>taking the pocket book out of the
desk, and advancing to </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span>)—the pocket book.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. She’s a ruined woman and so am I! (<i>dropping
his head against the side of the window</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>suddenly, and with an expression of
hope</i>) Surely I heard a voice!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. One of your servants probably. (<i>going up
towards mantel-piece, and taking his pistols</i>) I hope he will not take it into his head
to interrupt us, for I should certainly send a bullet through it. (P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> drops, and a noise of falling heard within
door, <span class="stage">R.&nbsp;C.</span>; </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> places the pistols on chimney piece</i>) And now,
madam, (<i>returning towards table at <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) with many
apologies for detaining you so long from your slumbers, I humbly take my leave. (<i>seeing
the receipt, which he has left on the table</i>) Stay! (<i>taking up the receipt, which he
presents to </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span>) I promised you a receipt, madam, and here it is.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>derisively</i>) A very valuable document
to me no doubt, sir.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. A very necessary one, madam, in all commercial
transactions. (M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><i> takes the receipt, and indignantly crumples it up in
her hand</i>) Once more, madam, farewell. (<i>taking his cloak and hat</i>) And in taking
my leave, be assured that I carry away with me——</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>sneeringly</i>) I am perfectly aware, sir,
what you carry away with you.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. The hope, madam, which I trust you in some degree
share with me, that our first interview will not be our last. (<i>turns at door, <span

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. He’s gone, and I have no longer strength even
to call for help.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>knocking violently at door</i>) But I have!
I’ll cry for help against any man in England! Help!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>rising</i>) Ah, is that you, David?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. No—it’s me—Postlethwaite. Cousin Percy, open the
door. (M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><i>
hastily runs and unlocks door, <span class="stage">R.&nbsp;C.</span>, </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> puts his head out</i>) Is the ruffian gone?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Yes—yes.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. You’re sure of it?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<span class="stage">L.</span>) Quite

I say. (<i>squaring violently</i>) Coward! (<i>in a tone of supreme contempt</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Then you have heard——</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Everything from that window, above that closet
there, or whatever it is where I’ve been locked up for the last hour among the
pickles.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. And yet you allowed me to be robbed.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Come I like that—you allowed yourself to be

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>contemptuously</i>) And you did

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. I beg your pardon, I looked on in silent
astonishment.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. But you ought to have made a noise.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. So I did—I tumbled down backwards into a lot of
grocery.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Do? Take example by me, show a proper spirit like

rope’s cut (<i>suddenly</i>) ah! the ruffian has left his pistols behind him. (<i>seizing
pistols off the mantel-piece</i>) Stand out of the way, cousin. (<i>rushing to
window</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. What are you about to do?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Do? send a bullet through his body.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Pshaw! Why you can’t even see him.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Then I’m the more likely to hit him; besides, it
will raise an alarm at all events. (<i>pulling both triggers as he points the pistols out
at window</i>) Holloa they’re not loaded! (<i>suddenly</i>) Oh, if I had only known that.
(<i>about to get out at the window</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Cousin, what are you about?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Why, as I can’t get out by the door, I must have
recourse to the window. (<i>getting out</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. And this for me! Oh, how kind of you, Cousin;
but pray mind how you get down!</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Don’t be alarmed; it’s a precious deal easier
than getting up! besides I know every inch of the road; so good bye, cousin, and in my way
to my friend the superintendent, I’ll knock up all the neighbours and tell them to scour
the country; we’ll find your fifteen thousand pounds again for you. (<i>gets quite out and
gradually disappears</i>) So don’t give way—keep up as I do. Oh, lud. (<i>suddenly
disappears altogether—loud noise of broken glass heard</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. He’s fallen! (<i>calling out of window</i>)
Cousin! cousin!</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>from without</i>) It’s all right. I’ve only
tumbled into a cucumber frame or something of the sort. I can have the bits of glass taken
out of me when I get back.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>looking out</i>) There he runs, but he’s
without his hat! (<i>calling aloud</i>) Cousin! cousin! you’ve dropped your hat! he
doesn’t hear me.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. (<i>without at door, <span
class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.</span></i>) Missus—missus, the door’s locked. (<i>unlocks door
and runs in followed by </i>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span><i>, both have their
night-caps</i><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<i>on, and </i>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span><i> carries an old fashioned
blunderbuss</i>) Oh, ma’am, what’s all this noise about—what does it all mean?</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. Ees, what do it all mean?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. It means, my poor Peggy, that I have been
robbed.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Robbed, but not murdered, I hope.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>smiling</i>) No, not quite, though I am
almost dead with alarm! David, have you seen no one?</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. No, ma’am—no one but your cousin, master Percy,
who arrived about half an hour before you came home.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Yes, yes, I know; but there was another.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. Then I didn’t let <i>him</i> in, and I know he
can’t have gone out again without my seeing him. (<i>aside</i>) To be sure I’ve been fast
asleep all the time.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Then perhaps he’s still in the house?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Lud a mercy! (<i>getting behind </i>D<span
class="smallerfont">AVID</span><i>, who in his turn tries to get behind </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>)</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. (<i>suddenly as he looks towards window, <span
class="stage">R.</span> in flat</i>) Look, ma’am, if there ben’t Sergeant Jones of the
rural police riding along the lane at the bottom of the garden. (<i>running to window and
shouting</i>) Here, Sergeant Jones, stop—he hears me, ma’am.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. This is fortunate indeed; so run, David, and
give him information of the robbery; tell him that he may rely on the most liberal reward.
(D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span><i> about to run off</i>) and, David, tell him
also, should he discover any clue, that he must communicate with his superintendent
here—that I expect him every moment; run, David. (D<span
class="smallerfont">AVID</span><i> runs off at <span class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.</span></i>)
and you, Peggy, go down stairs and be ready to open the door; I will go to my room for a
few minutes.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Do, ma’am; it’ll do you good to lie down a bit;
it’s broad day-light—just till Mr. Superintendent comes. (M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><i> enters her
room, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. (<i>looking after her</i>) Poor missus—she’s
lost all her treasures except me.</p>

<p class="direction_2"><i>Exit at door, </i><span class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.</span></p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>without</i>) I tell you it’s all right, so
come along.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>without</i>) But, my dear fellow—</p>

<p class="direction">P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> enters at <span

<i>without his beard, moustache, and over coat, and in a modern walking suit.</i></p>

<p class="no_indent">I never applied for the appointment; there’s some mistake.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Mistake, nonsense! here it is in the newspaper,
and you know as well as I do that newspapers never make mistakes. Captain Charles
Ratcliffe appointed superintendent of the rural police.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) What the devil’s to be
done?—luckily I’ve got rid of my disguise!</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. How very odd I should happen to run up against
you. Eh! at five o’clock in the morning too.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Yes, I was going home from a bachelor’s party.
(<i>confused</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Little dreaming that at that moment you held the
distinguished position of commander-in-chief of the rural police force of this important
district.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Pshaw! I shall resign at once. (<i>going</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>pulling him back</i>) You can’t till your
successor is appointed.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) There’s no escape, I must brazen
it out: lucky I have got rid of my disguise, at any rate I shall see her once more!
(<i>aloud, and in an assumed tone of authority</i>) ahem! (<i>seats himself</i>) now I am
ready to listen to you.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<span class="stage">L.</span>) That’s right—you
must know then. (<i>seats himself</i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<span class="stage">R.</span>) One moment, are
you about to address me in my official capacity?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Of course, I am.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Then don’t sit down.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. But really my back aches to that degree—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Then I’ll receive your deposition to-morrow.
(<i>gets up and going</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. No, no! (<i>pushing </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> in his chair again</i>) I’ll stand up there! and
now, my dear fellow—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. A little less familiarity, if you please, young
man.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Very well—you must know then, old chap—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Again—</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Well, then, your worship! there, will that do?
you must know then, your worship, that I’ve just been robbed of a very considerable sum of
money.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. You?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Well, my cousin, Mrs. Somerton has—and as I’m
going to marry her, what’s her’s is mine, and what’s mine’s my own; but you know all about
that, governor—I mean your worship.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Which property I suppose, you wish to
recover?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Of course, I do; you’ll excuse me, my dear boy,
Charley, I mean your worship, but that’s a remarkable stupid observation of your’s.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Silence—was the robbery you speak of accompanied
by violence?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Of course, it was! would you allow a fellow to
walk off with your property without making a fight of it, not you, my trojan—I mean your
worship! but I’ll tell you all about it. I had just arrived from London, and finding that
cousin Somerton had that instant returned home from a ball, I determined to give her an
agreeable surprise, and for that purpose I was walking on tiptoe along that passage, when
I was almost knocked off my legs by a piercing shriek. “My cousin in danger,” said I,
“then Postlethwaite to the rescue,” said I, and with an unfaltering grasp I seized the
handle of the door—it was locked, upon which with one blow of this fist—you know my
muscular power—I knocked the door clean off its hinges.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>smiling</i>) You don’t say so?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Well, in I rushed, and the first thing I saw
was——</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. What?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Nothing; the room was in total darkness, and the
next instant I found myself face to face with a gigantic housebreaker about seven foot
high, with two pair of pistols in each hand, and there, extended upon the hearth rug, with
her head on the fender lay my poor cousin in a dead faint, and as pale as a sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>smiling</i>) But how the deuce did you manage
to see all this when the room was in total darkness?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. What of that? everybody knows that housebreakers
are always as pale as a sheet when they faint away; I mean women are always seven feet
high—no, housebreakers—really you interrupt me so I don’t know what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>smiling</i>) Well?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Well, though I was unarmed, I instantly rushed
upon the two ruffians.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Two ruffians?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Yes. I said there were two, who instantly made
for the door, which luckily I had taken the precaution of locking.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Locking! What the door you had just knocked clean
off its hinges?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Yes. I forgot to mention that in the meantime I
had picked the door up and hung it on again. Well, finding they couldn’t escape, they both
sprang upon me at the same time! The fearful struggle then began afresh, till exhausted
nature could do no more, and the whole three of us rolled out of the window together. But
here comes my cousin! (<i>running to door, <span class="stage">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Then, as I said before, impudence befriend
me.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>handing in </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span>) Come along,
cousin, I told you I’d soon have my friend the superintendent here. Captain Ratcliffe, my
cousin. My cousin, Captain Ratcliffe. (<i>introducing them. </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><i> curtseys to
</i>R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>, <i>and on looking at him gives a very
slight start, while </i>R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> continues to show
the utmost sang froid</i>) And now, cousin, the sooner you give him all the particulars.
Why, what’s the matter with you? (<i>observing how </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><i> is
examining</i> R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Nothing. Doubtless I am mistaken. Yet, I am
under the impression that this is not the first time——</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. That we have met? madam, if so, I am ashamed to
say that I have forgotten the circumstance. (<i>crosses to <span
class="stage">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside</i>) The voice
too—pshaw—impossible!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Now, madam, as every moment is of the utmost
importance you must be good enough to answer a few questions. In the first place how the
entrance to the house was effected by the robbers. (<i>taking out his pocket book and
pencil.</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Robbers!—there was only one.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Only one! (<i>to </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span>) I understood you to say there were—</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>interrupting him</i>) Yes, yes. (<i>aside to
him</i>) Of course, she doesn’t know how many there were, because as soon as she saw
<i>one</i> she fainted.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. True! (<i>smiling</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside</i>) That voice again—I must be
mistaken—yet, every word he utters—(<i>looking again fixedly at </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i><span class="stage">C.</span>, to </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S.) You have not answered my question, madam.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. I can only say, sir, that on being left alone,
I was disturbed by a slight noise, and on turning round, he stood before me—as you do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. A bold and impudent villain, evidently. I can
easily conceive your alarm, madam, but luckily your cousin here on hearing your piercing
shrieks, (P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> pulls his coat tail</i>)
rushes to your assistance, and with one blow of his masculine fist—</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>stopping him, and aside</i>) That’ll do—don’t
remind her of that terrific scene, it distresses her.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>smiling again</i>) True. (<i>to </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S.) Then, madam, you would probably be able to identify
this audacious criminal?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>with intention</i>) Not with absolute
certainty, sir.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. No, more should I.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. That’s strange too, considering the length of
time you were struggling with him.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Yes, yes. (<i>aside to him</i>) That’ll do—she
can’t bear it.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>still with intention</i>) And were I to
act upon my present <i>suspicions,</i> however well grounded they may appear, I might be
the means of compromising—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Who, madam?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>looking at him</i>) One perhaps, whose
position in society——</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Nay, madam—as the representative of the law, I
tell you that it matters not what his social position may be, we must not mince
matters.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Certainly not. I’d rather mince him. Fifteen
thousand pounds is a lump of money.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>with pretended astonishment</i>) Fifteen
thousand pounds—the unconscionable scoundrel!—one moment (<i>writing in the pocket
book</i>)—amount stolen—fifteen thousand pounds; number of robbers——</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>aside to him</i>) Uncertain! as there seems
to be a little difference of opinion between cousin and me upon that point. You’d better
say “uncertain.”</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>to </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>.
S.) Bank notes, I presume?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Yes, sir—bank notes.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. And contained in that writing desk.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside</i>) ’Tis he, I’m sure of it
(<i>hastily and aside to </i>P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i>, while
</i>R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> is examining the writing desk</i>)—tell
me, do you say you know him?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Who, the housebreaker?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. No, that person. (<i>pointing to </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Know my friend Ratcliffe, of course I do.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>observing them and coming down, between
them.</i>) I regret I cannot hold out to you any reasonable hope of recovering your
property.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. You don’t mean that?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Why, unfortunately Mrs. Somerton is unable to
give me the slightest clue.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. But I do possess a clue—a certain infallible
one.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Ah!—then where is your clue—produce your
clue—what is your clue?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>looking intently at</i> R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>) A paper in the handwriting of this bold and impudent
villain, (R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span> <i>slightly</i> <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-17">[Pg 17]</a></span><i>starts</i>) treating
the matter as a commercial transaction, and affecting to acknowledge as a voluntary loan
from me the amount of which he plundered me.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>quickly</i>) A most important document
indeed, and of the utmost consequence that I should obtain immediate possession of it.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>sarcastically</i>) I believe you, sir;
shall I fetch it?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. And you <i>will remain here till I return?
</i>(<i>significantly</i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Assuredly.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>hastily—aside to </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span>) See that he does.</p>

<p class="direction_2"><i>Exit hastily, </i><span class="stage">L.&nbsp;D.</span></p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside and agitated</i>) That cursed paper may
betray me, and this mad desperate game will have been played in vain.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>taking his arm and in a confidential
manner</i>) Now between you and me and the post, if Cousin Somerton was to say to you,
what will you give me for the chance of recovering my fifteen thousand pounds? what would
you feel disposed to offer?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Not fifteen thousand farthings.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>aside</i>) The devil.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. But what of that; the loss of a few paltry
thousand can never lessen the intense affection you feel for your charming cousin.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. What do you mean by “intense affection?” I
respect her—I like her—so I did my grandmother, but it never would occur to me to fall
down and worship the ground she treads upon! besides to be candid with you, I don’t think
she is the sort of woman to fret herself into fiddlestrings about <i>me.</i></p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Indeed!</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. No; besides, I put it to you, would it not be
most selfish, most unkind in me to take a mean advantage of her promise to marry me, and
compel my young and lovely relative to spend the remainder of her existence with me in my
second floor in Arabella Row, Pimlico.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>grasping </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> hand</i>)
That sentiment does you honour! Then she’s at liberty to cancel her engagement to you?
(<i>eagerly</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Yes, from this moment she’s at liberty.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span><i> running, <span
class="stage">L.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.</span></i></p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Where is he? (<i>comes down <span
class="stage">C.</span></i>) Where’s Mr. Superintendent? (<i>to </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>) Oh, sir, (<i>seeing </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span>) Lor, Master Percy, is that you? (<i>throwing her
arms round </i>P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i>, then turning again to
</i>R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>) Oh, sir, I’ve got such news. (<i>to
</i>P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span>) Lor bless’ee, I must have another
buss. (<i>flinging her arms round </i>P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. That’ll do, Peggy; I appreciate your affection,
but it rumples one’s front. (<i>arranging his shirt</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. (<i>to </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>) Then, sir—well, and so you must know that.
(<i>turning to </i>P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> again</i>) Lor
love’ee. (<i>about to embrace him again. </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> turns away</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. (<i>to </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>) Well, sir, Sergeant Jones has just been<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-18">[Pg 18]</a></span> here, and says he to
me—says he—tell my Superintendent, Captain Ratcliffe, says he, that we’ve found the
robber, says he.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>triumphantly</i>) And the money too, of
course; not that my intense affection for my charming cousin could ever be influenced by a
few paltry thousands more or less—no; I love her for herself alone.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. It does my old heart good to hear you say that,
because they’ve neither found the robber nor the money yet.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Pooh, what a stupid old fool you are. What have
they found then?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. A hat!</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. A hat! I never heard of anything so absurd in all
my life.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. But it’s a very peculiar hat—what they call a
wide-awake—a green one. (P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> here slowly
raises his hand and feels his head, then looks about him. </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> notices his movements</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. Sergeant Jones found it under the window; but
that’s not all—he says that the robber in making his escape must have fallen into the
green house, and that probably his clothes may have been cut, or that pieces of glass may
be sticking in him. (P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>.<i> falls behind—gives a sudden
start of pain—then examines his coat tails and finds one of them torn, fixes his hand on
it. </i>R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> still observing him</i>) But that’s
not all, there are footmarks on the gravel walk, and as the gravel was only laid down
yesterday, Sergeant Jones says that some of it must be sticking to his boots. (<i>here
</i>P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> begins shuffling with his feet
about, which he keeps up incessantly</i>) But that’s not all! as Joe Podger, the
blacksmith was going to his work this morning, he saw a man, a little short man, he says,
(P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> draws himself up and crosses to <span
class="stage">C.</span></i>) drop from that window, and he says he should know him again
among a thousand.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Oh lud! (<i>slightly staggering</i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>trying to check a laugh</i>) What’s the
matter, my dear fellow? here sit down. (<i>making </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OS</span>.<i> sit down, who utters a cry of pain and jumps up again,
then seeing </i>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>.<i> and </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">EG</span>.<i> looking at him, begins shuffling his feet about again,
and keeping his hand on his coat tail</i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>to </i>P<span class="smallerfont">EG</span>.)
Tell Sergeant Jones from me to act upon the information he has got without one moment’s
loss of time; run, fly! (P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span><i> trots out at door,
<span class="stage">L.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.</span></i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>to </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OS.</span><i> and slapping him on the shoulder</i>) This is famous
news indeed, eh?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Yes, glorious news, though for my part I can’t
see that there’s anything at all in finding a wide-a-wake—any man might lose his
wide-a-wake—I might lose mine, and it might be a green wide-a-wake.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Heaven forbid, for I should immediately arrest
you, my dear friend, but what of that? your charming cousin is too well aware of your
intense affection.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. What d’ye mean by <i>intense affection?</i> As I
said before, I respect her—I like her, but—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. But what?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>grasping </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> hand and
assuming a desperate tone and manner</i>) The dreadful truth must be spoken! I’m a
rascal—I<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-19">[Pg 19]</a></span> love
another—the interesting widow of a large straw bonnet maker. When I say large, I don’t
allude to the bonnet maker, but the business—and shall I basely forsake the confiding
woman who has placed all her straw bonnets—I mean all her happiness in my hands?—No!
though my cousin <i>will</i> soon have her £15,000 again.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. That’s very doubtful.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. No such thing. I’m certain of it, and so are you;
still, never, never shall it be said of Postlethwaite, that he was actuated by the love of
filthy lucre—so you’ll wish her good bye for me, won’t you?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Stay. Suppose you write a few lines to her,
stating your reasons for renouncing her hand, and I’ll deliver the letter to her.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. I’ll do it at once, (<i>aside</i>) and
considering that there’s very little chance of Cousin Somerton’s seeing a shilling of her
money again, and a very considerable chance of my getting into trouble; the sooner I make
my way back to Arabella Row, Pimlico, the better. (<i>goes into room, <span
class="stage">R.</span>&nbsp;<span class="normal">2</span>&nbsp;<span
class="stage">E.</span></i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>anxiously</i>) <i>Will</i> he write to her?
will he, indeed, renounce her hand?</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span>, <span class="stage">L.</span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside</i>) Still here, ’tis well; and now,
Captain Ratcliffe, it is my turn to frighten you.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>resuming his official manner</i>) Well,
madam, have you found this important paper?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Yes, sir, but conceive my annoyance, when
instead of a receipt, as I anticipated, I found the paper consisted of a few wretched
insipid verses; intended to be very complimentary, no doubt, but commonplace in the
extreme.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) This is pleasant. I thought they
were remarkably pretty verses. (<i>aloud</i>) Might I be favoured with a perusal of
them?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Unfortunately, a near neighbour of mine, a
<i>magistrate</i> happened to look in, and thinking it would forward the ends of justice,
I placed the paper in his hands.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. A magistrate?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Yes, who on looking at it, suddenly exclaimed,
“I cannot be mistaken—no, I’ll swear to the handwriting.”</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Indeed! (<i>aside</i>) The devil! (<i>aloud</i>)
and his name is——</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Boldwig.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Boldwig! (<i>aside</i>) My old colonel, damn it,
I’ve written a hundred letters to him.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. The colonel fancies the robber may be still
concealed on the premises.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>forcing a laugh</i>) Ha, ha! Still on the
premises, a very likely matter.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Why not? So bold and impudent a villain, as
you very properly designate him. How fortunate it was that I remembered the existence of
that “important paper.”</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Yes, it was a very brilliant idea of yours,
indeed.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. And how still more fortunate that Colonel
Boldwig at<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span> once
recognised the handwriting, for of course it will infallibly lead to the capture of the
unconscionable scoundrel, as you very properly called him.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>rather nettled</i>) You seem remarkably
anxious to punish this unhappy misguided being, ma’am.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Heyday! did you not say to me, just now,
“Madam, as the representative of the law, I tell you that it matters not what his social
position may be; we must not mince matters.” (<i>imitating </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> manner.</i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) She’s laughing at me, that’s quite
clear. (<i>aloud</i>) Of course not; but—but—(<i>drawing his chair closer to </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span>)—but—(<i>aside</i>) Pon my life it requires more
courage than I imagined. (<i>aloud</i>) I was about to observe that the circumstances
attending this robbery are so—so whimsical.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Whimsical?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. No, not whimsical, eccentric! that one is almost
inclined to ascribe it to some other motive.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside</i>) We are coming to it by degrees;
(<i>aloud</i>) and pray, sir, what other motive can your lively imagination suggest?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>drawing still nearer, and after a short
hesitation, then in a low and impassioned tone</i>) Love!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>aside and smiling</i>) At last.
(<i>aloud</i>) Love! ha, ha, ha! Love of bank notes!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>earnestly</i>) No. Love for you. Yes, madam,
cannot you imagine an admiration so boundless—a passion so irresistible, that it might
prompt a man?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. To rob me of £15,000, and frighten me out of
senses into the bargain.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>still more earnestly</i>) Yes, madam, if by
so doing, if by apparently reducing the woman to poverty, he hoped to obtain a voluntary
resignation of her hand from a rival, who loves her for her fortune only.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Really, Captain Ratcliffe, I must confess you
have imagined a marvellous pleasant love story.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Not more marvellous than true. Here are the
proofs, (<i>gives pocket book to </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span>) and now think, madam, what a love must that man’s be
who could thus risk his name, character, and reputation, with the sole hope of preserving
you your liberty.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. But unfortunately the denouement of this
romance of real life is wanting; the rival does not resign the lady’s hand.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside, and looking towards room, <span
class="stage">R.</span>&nbsp;<span class="normal">2</span>&nbsp;<span
class="stage">E.</span></i>) Why the devil doesn’t he make haste with the letters? (P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i> looks in at the door</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>catching a glimpse of him</i>) No, sir, I
know my cousin too well—he loves me too dearly to care about my loss of fortune; <i>he</i>
will be only too happy to work for me, toil for me, slave for me.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>at door</i>) Will he! (<i>disappears</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. He will never resign the hand of her he loves,
beggared though she be. (<i>here </i>P<span class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span><i>
comes out of room cautiously, slips the letter into </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> hand, and runs
out at door, <span class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.</span></i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>presenting letter to </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span>) From Mr.
Percy<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Postlethwaite, madam. (<i>aside</i>) If he has deceived me I’ll make Arabella Row,
Pimlico, the scene of a terrific drama.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>reading letter</i>) “Ever beloved cousin,
I need not say that the loss of your fortune is nothing to me——” (<i>to </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>) You hear?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) The devil take him!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>reading</i>) “——But as the presence of a
handsome, dashing young man like Captain Ratcliffe, under your roof in the middle of the
night will necessarily afford materials for all the scandal mongers in the neighbourhood,
I reluctantly tear your image from my heart, and bid you farewell for ever."</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Then you are free—free to bestow your heart, your
hand!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Nay, sir, what if my heart were no longer at
my disposal? (R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span><i> starts</i>) What if it had
long since been given to one who once preserved my life at the peril of his own, and whose
letters faithfully preserved (<i>slowly and with emotion drawing forth a packet of letters
from her bosom, and looking down</i>) enabled me to recognise his handwriting.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Can it be possible? (<i>with rapture</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. That I have been taking my revenge on you for
the last half hour without your perceiving it! (<i>holding out her hand</i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. Oh, madam! (<i>kissing her hand</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Hark! (<i>noise without</i>)</p>

come agreeable, drag him in by the hair of his head.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AV</span>. Here, missus, we’ve got the robber.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>holding </i>R<span

have I!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">AVID</span>. Here be the desperate villain, ma’am, and here
be his desperate green wide-awake; (<i>shewing hat</i>) and what’s more, we won’t let him
go.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. No more will I! (<i>seeing </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLE</span>.) Cousin Postlethwaite!</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. (<i>running forward</i>) Lawks! yes—so it be.
Oh, Master Percy! (<i>throwing her arms round </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>throwing her off</i>) Don’t be a fool, Peggy.
As I said before, it rumples one’s front.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>making a sign, all come forward and
surround her</i>) My good friends, you need give yourselves no further trouble, I have
recovered my property. My fifteen thousand pounds are here.</p>

<p class="direction_2">(<i>shows pocket book</i>)</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. You don’t mean that! (<i>very tenderly</i>) Oh,
my ever beloved cousin! (<i>aside to </i>R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>)
Where’s my letter? (<i>again to </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S<span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON</span><i>, and still more tenderly</i>) I repeat—oh, my ever
beloved cousin! (<i>again aside to </i>R<span class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE</span>) Where’s
my letter?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>aside to him</i>) I gave it to Mrs.
Somerton—it’s all right.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. All right! I’m horribly afraid it’s all
wrong!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. Yes, cousin, I’ve read your cruel words, and
as it seems you won’t have me—— (<i>with affected grief</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. But I will. (<i>very tenderly</i>) Dry your tears
ever-beloved one—I <i>will</i> have you.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. What, in spite of the presence of a fine
dashing young man under my roof in the middle of the night—eh, cousin?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>still very tenderly</i>) What of that? I’m
not so very particular.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. But think of the scandal mongers of the
neighbourhood—eh, cousin?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Never mind—I’m desperate!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. So am I—and, therefore, as the only means of
preserving my reputation, I gave my hand to him who has compromised it.</p>

<p class="direction_2">(<i>giving her hand to </i>R<span

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. What, Charley Ratcliffe?</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">EGGY</span>. (<i>aside</i>) Then that’s Mr. C. R. after
all.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. (<i>to </i>P<span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE</span>) Yes, my dear friend, the gigantic housebreaker,
seven feet high, with two pair of pistols in each of his brawny hands, stands before
you.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. You? Poo—poo! Where are your whiskers?—where’s
your imperial?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. In my pocket—ha, ha!</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. (<i>after a short pause</i>) I say, Master
Charley, what sort of a game have you been playing here?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. S. (<i>smiling</i>) A game of fright.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">OS</span>. Ecod, it’s more like “Beat my neighbour out of
doors!”</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">AT</span>. At any rate, I have secured this lady for my

<p>In general, I have retained variant spellings (e.g., “tarletan”, “trowsers”, “does’nt”,
“her’s”, and “your’s”) and the idiosyncrasies of the original punctuation. However, for

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
