      CHAPTER I
    
    
      "Hallo! young lady, what on earth are you doing here?" and Gerrard bent
      down over his horse's shoulder, and looked inquiringly into the face of a
      small and exceedingly ill-clad girl of about ten years of age.
    
    
      "Nothing, sir, I only came out for a walk, and to get some pippies."
    
    
      "And where do you get them?"
    
    
      "Down there, sir, on the sand," and the child pointed with a strong,
      sun-browned hand to the beach, which was within a mile.
    
    
      "Eat them?"
    
    
      "Yes       they're lovely. Jim and I roast them in the stockman's kitchen
      when auntie has gone to bed."
    
    
      "And who is Jim?"
    
    
      "Jim Incubus; I'm Mary Incubus."
    
    
      "Mary what?"
    
    
      "Incubus, sir."
    
    
      Gerrard dismounted, and tying his reins to a stirrup, let his horse graze.
      Then taking his pipe out of his pocket, he filled and lit it, and motioned
      to the child to sit down beside him upon a fallen honeysuckle tree.
    
    
      "What is your auntie's name, my dear?" and he took the child's hand in
      his.
    
    
      "Mrs Elizabeth Westonley."
    
    
      "Ah! I thought so. Now, did you ever hear her talk of an Uncle Tom?"
    
    
      "Yes, sir," replied the child, wonderingly, "he's a cattleman in the
      Northern Territory."
    
    
      "Well! I'm the cattleman, Mary. I'm the Uncle Tom, and I've come to see
      you all."
    
    
      "All the way from Cape York! Why! Uncle Westonley says it's two thousand
      miles from here."
    
    
      "So it is, my dear," and the man stroked the child's tousled chestnut hair
      caressingly; "quite two thousand miles," and then as he looked at her
      pityingly he muttered something very uncomplimentary to Aunt Elizabeth.
    
    
      "Are you really my uncle Thomas Gerrard?"
    
    
      "I am really your Uncle Tom Gerrard, and you are my niece Mary. Your
      mother was my sister, whose name was Mary."
    
    
      "Uncle Westonley likes you."
    
    
      "Does he?" and the young man's kindly grey eyes smiled as he stroked his
      pointed beard. "Good old Ted!"
    
    
      "Who's Ted?"
    
    
      "Your Uncle Westonley, of course. Don't you call him 'Uncle Ted'?"
    
    
      "Oh, no!" and the child's big eyes looked startlingly into his, "I
      call him 'Uncle Westonley.' Aunt Elizabeth said I must never say 'Uncle
      Ted,' as it's vulgar, and she won't allow it, and uncle says I must be
      obedient to her."
    
    
      Gerrard put out his right arm, drew her to him, and looked intently into
      her face. In her dreamy, violet-hued eyes, with the dark pencilled brows,
      and the small delicate mouth, he saw the image of his dead twin-sister,
      Mary.
    
    
      "Poor little mite!" he again said to himself pityingly, as he looked at
      her coarse though not ill-kept clothing, "Lizzie always was a cold-hearted
      prig, and always will be to the end of her days       even in her moribund
      moments. How could she let this child wander out so far away from the
      station." Then he took two or three great puffs at his pipe. "How far is
      it to Marumbah, little niece Mary?"
    
    
      "Five miles, sir."
    
    
      "Don't say 'sir.' Who taught you to say 'sir'?"
    
    
      "Aunt Elizabeth."
    
    
      "But you must not say 'sir' to me. I'm your uncle. And you must call me
      'Uncle Tom.' Understand?"
    
    
      "Aunt Elizabeth insists on my saying 'sir' to gentlemen."
    
    
      "Does she now? Well, my dear, you must never say 'sir' to me       I'll
      ask Aunt Elizabeth not to insist on your calling me 'sir.' You see I
      shouldn't like it I want you to call me 'Uncle Tom.' Lots of people call
      me Tom. Some of 'em call me Tom and Jerry       short, you know, for
      Thomas Gerrard."
    
    
      "Aunt Elizabeth says you're godless and wild."
    
    
      "Does she really?" and the grey eyes twinkled. "That's only her way
      of talking, you see. 'Godless and wild' doesn't mean anything very bad
      when Aunt Elizabeth says it It only means       well, nothing particular.
      When you are older you will understand."
    
    
      "Yes, sir."
    
    
      "Uncle Tom!"
    
    
      "Yes, Uncle Tom."
    
    
      "Now, Mary, what about these pippies? Will you let me come with you? I'm
      awfully fond of pippies       can eat bushels of 'em."
    
    
      "Yes, Uncle Tom," and the child's face lighted up, "oh! I wish Jim was
      here too. Are you his uncle, too?"
    
    
      Gerrard rubbed his cheek thoughtfully. His sister Elizabeth had no
      children, and he wondered who Jim could be.
    
    
      "No, I don't think I am. When did he come to Marumbah?"
    
    
      "Uncle Westonley brought him from Sydney about       about six months
      ago."
    
    
      "Where is he now?"
    
    
      "At home, with Aunt Elizabeth. He's been fractious, and is being
      punished."
    
    
      "Being punished?"
    
    
      "Yes, he's locked up in the spare room."
    
    
      "What did he do?"
    
    
      "Put a saddle on the brindle bull calf, and tried to make it backjump."
    
    
      "Did it?"
    
    
      "Oh, yes, beautifully, and Jim had his forehead cut, and a lot of blood
      came."
    
    
      Gerrard laughed as he put down his pipe, "And what did Uncle Westonley
      say?"
    
    
      "Uncle Westonley is away in Sydney," said the child gravely, and as she
      spoke her eyes filled with tears.
    
    
      Gerrard understood. "Well, never mind, Mary; now you and I shall go and
      get these pippies."
    
    
      From his saddle dees he took a pair of green-hide hobbles, lifted off the
      saddle with its valise, hobbled the horse, and then holding the child's
      hand in his, set out towards the beach.
    
    
      "Now, Mary, you and I are going to have a great old time. First of all,
      you are going to show me how you get pippies. Then we will come
      back and cook them, and have some tea and some damper as well, for I have
      both in my saddle-bags, and I have a wood duck too, which I shot this
      morning. Did you see it?"
    
    
      "Yes, Uncle Tom; and your gun, too. Jim loves guns."
    
    
      "Does he, my chick? Jim must be a man after my own heart."
    
    
      "What's that, Uncle Tom?"
    
    
      "Oh, I'll tell you some day. Now come along for the pippies. You show me
      how you get them, and I'll show you how I get them."
    
    
      Holding his hand, the child led him down through the wild, sweet-smelling
      littoral scrub by a cattle track to the beach, where before them lay the
      blue Pacific, shining under the rays of the afternoon sun. The tide was
      low, and the "pippies" (cockles) were easily had, for they protruded their
      suckers out upon every few inches of the sand. Gerrard, booted and spurred
      as he was, went into the water, dug into the sand with his hands, and
      helped the child to fill the basket she carried, and then, realising that
      she was excited, and being himself determined upon a certain course of
      action, he walked slowly back with her to where he had left the horses.
    
    
      "Mary, dear, just sit down, and listen to me. I am not going to Marumbah
      to-night, and you must stay with me. We shall be there early in the
      morning."
    
    
      "Oh, Uncle Tom! Aunt Elizabeth will punish me."
    
    
      "Don't be afraid, chick       she won't. I will explain everything to her
      in the morning."
    
    
      In a few minutes he had lit two fires, and when the coals were glowing on
      one, and the child was attending to the roasting of the pippies, he was
      boiling a billy of tea on the other, and laying out some cold salt beef
      and damper from his saddle-bags.
    
    
      "Come, chick, you and I are going to have a great time to-night, as I told
      you, pippies and wild duck, and tea and damper, and after that is over you
      shall be tucked up in my blankets, and sleep until we hear the bell-birds
      calling to us in the morning."
    
    
      "Aunt Elizabeth              "
    
    
      "That's all right, chick. Aunt Elizabeth will have nothing to say about
      it. I'll settle with her. Now, sit down on that blanket       I
      daresay you're hungry, eh?"
    
    
      "Please, Uncle Tom, let me go home, Aunt Elizabeth              "
    
    
      "We'll go home, chick, when the bell-birds and the crockets begin to sing.
      And Aunt Elizabeth won't say a word to you." He smiled somewhat grimly to
      himself, "don't be afraid of that. You and I are camping out tonight       like
      two old mates. By-the-way, where do you sleep at Marumbah?"
    
    
      "In the little room, just off the saddle-room."
    
    
      "And Jim?"
    
    
      "Oh, Aunt Elizabeth doesn't like him to sleep in the house, so he sleeps
      in the stockman's spare room."
    
    
      "How old is he, chick?"
    
    
      The child bent her head in thought for a moment or two. "About ten, I
      think, Uncle Tom. He is really and truly such a good boy       Uncle
      Westonley says so, but Aunt Elizabeth says he is godless and an 'incubus.'
      What does incubus mean? I am one too."
    
    
      "Nothing, nothing very much, little one," said Gerrard, as he held the
      breast of the wild duck he had plucked over the glowing coals of his fire;
      "you see, your Aunt Elizabeth doesn't mean to be unkind to you       it's
      only her way of saying that you and Jim are troublesome at times. And I
      don't think she will call you or Jim 'incubuses,' any more after
      to-morrow. Now, let us have something to eat. See, it is nearly dark."
    
    
      They ate their supper to the murmur of the ever-sounding surf upon the
      beach, and then Gerrard spreading out his blankets under the shelter of a
      spreading wild honeysuckle, covered the child over with a sheet of
      waterproof cloth to keep off the dew.
    
    
      "I must say my prayers, Uncle Tom." "Yes, dear," he said softly, "but you
      needn't get up. Can't you say them lying down?"
    
    
      "Oh, no, Uncle Tom. That would be very wrong, and denotes laziness, Aunt
      Elizabeth says. Do you say your prayers lying down?"
    
    
      "Yes, chick," was the prompt response, "generally when I'm lying down at
      night in the bush, looking up at the stars. And I daresay it does 'denote
      laziness,' as Aunt Elizabeth says. But at the same time I think it really
      doesn't matter to God whether one is lying down or sitting up, or on one's
      knees when we pray to Him."
    
    
      "Oh, Uncle Tom! Are you quite sure?"
    
    
      "Dead sure, little woman       as sure as ducks are ducks       especially
      when little girls are tired."
    
    
      "Then I'll say my prayers lying down."
    
    
      She clasped her two little sunbrowned hands together and said the Lord's
      Prayer, and then paused.
    
    
      "Shall I say the extrack?"
    
    
      "The extrack?"
    
    
      "Yes, the extrack from the Catechism. Aunt Elizabeth composed some of it."
    
    
      "Oh! she composed some of it, did she? Yes, by all means say 'the
      extract.'"
    
    
      The child closed her eyes again, and began very slowly:
    
    
      "'Before I slumber, O Lord, I comment myself to Thy care and protection,
      however unworthy and thoughtless my conduct has been during the day now
      closed.'" ("That's Aunt Elizabeth," muttered Gerrard under his breath.)
      "'I will try hard to hasten my rebellious spirit,       no not hasten, but
      chasten       I always say that wrong, Uncle Tom       to reverently
      submit myself to all my governors, teachers, spiritual pastors and
      masters: to regulate my conduc', and demean myself with all humility; to
      keep my hands from picking and stealing, to recollect that I may be called
      this night before, Thee to answer for my many sins and transgressions.'
      That's all Uncle Tom."
    
    
      Gerrard listened with the utmost gravity.
    
    
      "That's all right, Mary; but I think it is a bit too long a prayer for
      very little girls. Now, by and by, I'll teach you a new prayer."
    
    
      "A new prayer! Oh, that will be nice! Sometimes Uncle Westonley
      let's me pray for Bunny."
    
    
      "Who is Bunny?"
    
    
      "My native bear. I'll show him to you to-morrow. You see, when Uncle
      Westonley comes to see me at night, after Aunt Elizabeth has heard me say
      the Lord's Prayer, and the extrack, he lets me pray for Bunny because he
      is full of ticks, and Jim says hell die. I say 'dear God, don't let Bunny
      die, freshen and preserve him in Thy sight, and make him whole.' I got
      that out of a book, and Uncle Westonley says it will do very nicely."
    
    
      "Couldn't be better, little woman. I think it's a grand prayer."
    
    
      "But, Uncle Tom, Bunny has been sicker an' sicker, and won't eat anything
      but the very youngest, weeniest gum leaves, and Aunt Elizabeth says he's a
      hideous little beast. And Jim and me love him to death."
    
    
      "Don't worry about what Aunt Elizabeth says," and Gerrard bent down and
      kissed her. "I'll try and cure Bunny for you. I know a heap of things
      about native bears and ticks, and know exactly what to do."
    
    
      The child smiled delightedly into his face,* "Oh! Uncle Tom, you are as
      kind as Uncle Westonley, good-night."
    
    
      "Good-night, little woman," and then the man laid himself down upon the
      sandy ground beside her, with a certain resolve in his mind.
    
    
      At six o'clock in the morning, he rode up to Marumbah Station with little
      Mary held in front of him. Mrs Westonley, pale-faced, austere, and much
      agitated, met him as he dismounted.
    
    
      "Oh, dear, Thomas! Just fancy you finding the child and bringing
      her home! I sent out Toby, the black boy, to look for her, and I suppose
      he is looking for her still       the naughty              "
    
    
      "That's all right, Lizzie, don't get into a fluster," said Gerrard
      placidly, as he dismounted and kissed his sister, "Toby did find
      her       that is, he found her and me comfortably camped for the night.
      He's coming along presently with my packhorse."
    
    
      Mrs Westonley turned angrily upon the child, and was about to deliver a
      lecture, when her brother placed his hand upon her arm and drew her aside.
    
    
      "Look here, Lizzie, I'm your guest, and I'm also your brother; but if you
      bully that unfortunate youngster, I'll just get into my saddle again, and
      ride off without putting my foot over your threshold."
    
    
      Mrs Westonley's pale, clear-cut face flushed deeply. "I never expected
      such a remark as this from you, Thomas."
    
    
      "And I never expected that you would have treated your own sister's child
      as you have done," was the stern reply; "I found her five miles from here,
      wandering alone. Have you no love or sympathy in your heart, or compassion
      for children, because you have none yourself?" and the grey eyes flashed.
    
    
      Mrs Westonley gazed at him in astonishment, and twined her hands together
      in mingled anger and fear that this brother       fifteen years younger
      than herself       should so dare to speak to her.
    
    
      "The child is a great trial              "
    
    
      "Aye, an 'incubus,' you call her, the poor little mite. But I hardly
      thought you read novels."
    
    
      "I read novels! Never! What do you mean?"
    
    
      Gerrard drew her inside the house, and patted her cheek, ready to forgive.
    
    
      "Oh, I did read a book somewhere about a stepmother or an aunt or
      something of the kind, who was always talking about some unfortunate child
      committed to her care, as an 'incubus.' Now, that's all I have to say. I
      love the kid already. She has Mary's eyes and Mary's voice, and, if
      you don't want her I do. When will breakfast be ready, old
      girl?"
    
    
      "Eight o'clock," said Mrs Westonley faintly, wondering if she were awake
      or dreaming. Who but this handsome, sunburnt brother would dare to lecture
      her, and then wind up by addressing her as "old girl"!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II
    
    
      When Captain Richard Gerrard       the father of Mrs Westonley       came
      to Australia from India, he first settled in Gippsland, in Victoria. A
      retired military man, with ample means, he devoted himself successfully to
      pastoral pursuits, and soon took a leading part in the advancement of the
      colony. He had married the daughter of an English chaplain, by whom he had
      but one child       Elizabeth       and when she was but an infant of two
      years of age, Mrs Gerrard died. For thirteen years her husband remained
      faithful to her memory, and then did what all his neighbours regarded as a
      very sensible thing       he married the daughter of a neighbouring
      squatter, and sent his child to England to be educated. His second wife
      was a beautiful, vigorous, and well-trained woman, mentally and
      physically, and although her parents were English, she was a native of the
      colony, and, naturally enough, took the deepest interest in all that
      concerned the station, the advancement of her husband's interests, and the
      colony in which she was born. Two children were born to them, a twin son
      and daughter, and as time went on, Captain Gerrard's station became one of
      the best in Victoria, and the "R over G" brand of cattle brought "top"
      prices in the Melbourne market.
    
    
      After completing her education in England, Elizabeth Gerrard returned to
      Australia. She was a remarkably handsome girl, but cold, even to
      chilliness, in her manner, especially to her step-mother, for she had much
      resented her father's second marriage. The six years she had spent in
      England seemed to have entirely changed her character and disposition, and
      when soon after her return, Edward Westonley, a young squatter, who was
      the owner of Marumbah Downs, fell violently in love with her pink and
      white beauty, and she accepted him, even her father, although he loved her       was
      secretly pleased.
    
    
      Marumbah Downs was over a hundred miles from Captain Gerrard's station,
      and there Westonley took his bride. He was a cheerful, somewhat careless
      man, very "horsey" in his tastes, and fond of good company. Both his
      father-in-law and Mrs Gerrard liked him greatly, and the two children by
      the second marriage, Tom and Mary, gave him their affection the first time
      they saw him.
    
    
      The boy Tom grew up like most Australian-born boys of his class of life
      and surroundings, and before he was twenty years of age, was managing one
      of his father's stations in Queensland, and managing it prosperously. Soon
      after he had taken charge, he heard from his father that his twin sister
      Mary was to be married to a local medical man       a Doctor Rayner, who
      had been her steady admirer since she was a girl of fifteen.
    
    
      "It will be a very happy union," wrote Captain Gerrard to his son, "of
      that I am certain, and although he's too young a man to have much of a
      practice for some time, he'll get along all right. And even if things do
      go against him, it won't matter to him and Mary       I'll stand to them.
      Mary is writing to you by this mail." Then after alluding to some business
      matters in connection with his various stations he went on to say.
      "Westonley comes over to see us now and then       Lizzie never. Poor
      Westonley! Lizzie has crumpled him up altogether, although when he comes
      to see us he is the same cheery Ted of yore, and he, Rayner, and I had
      some grand kangarooing together when he was here last. Lizzie, during the
      past five years has become more and more crotchety, and has given herself
      up to 'religious thought and work,' as she calls it, from which I
      surmise that her's is a reign of terror at Marumbah Downs. She has built a
      little tin-pot chapel in which there is not enough room to swing a cat by
      the tail, and had it opened a few months ago by some swagger curate from
      Melbourne       poor old Preston, the Scotch parson at Marumbah township
      not being considered good enough, and having incurred her wrath by openly
      stating that when he had a cold he took whisky toddy at bedtime! then the
      silly woman       who rules poor Westonley with a rod of iron       had a
      notice put up in the men's quarters that all hands, from the head stockman
      down to the black boys, were to attend service every future Sunday morning
      and evening, Westonley       whom she wanted to conduct the service       bucked,
      and said he could not make an ass of himself before his employés, and the
      next day the entire crowd       stockmen, fencers, sawyers, etc.       rolled
      up to the station and gave Westonley a week's notice, and the poor fellow
      had to effect a compromise, they agreeing to come into the 'Chapel' and
      let Lizzie read them a chapter 'of suthin' outer the Bible,' if they could
      have the rest of the day for their usual Sunday recreations       euchre
      or kangarooing. I never thought Lizzie would turn out to be a crank, but a
      crank she is, and I'm afraid Westonley is not at all a happy man, though
      he yields to her in almost everything.
    
    
      "Your mother has not been at all well for the post six months. She will be
      very lonely when Mary leaves the house, and you must come to us for a
      month or two next year; 'twill cheer her up. She doesn't want Lizzie       neither
      do I; she'd depress a dead bull calf, by just looking at him."
    
    
      And then within a twelvemonth, came the tragedy of the Gerrard family.
    
    
      Captain Gerrard, by Dr Rayner's advice, decided to take his wife to Sydney
      to consult a specialist, and Rayner went with them. They took passage on a
      coastal steamer named the Cassowary       a small paddle-wheel
      vessel of three hundred tons, old, ill-found, and utterly unable to cope
      with the savage easterly gale that met her as she rounded Cape Howe, and
      doots north for Sydney.
    
    
      A fortnight later, Mary Rayner, as she was putting her two months' old
      baby girl to sleep, was called from her bedroom to see a stranger in the
      sitting-room. He was a stockman from a station seventy miles away on the
      coast.
    
    
      He silently handed her a letter, and then turned away, She opened and read
      it. It was from die Police Inspector of the Cape Howe district, and in a
      few sympathetic words told her that the Cassowary had been lost
      near Cape Howe, and that every soul on board but one seaman and a child of
      four years of age had perished, and that her husband, her father and her
      mother had been buried three days previously.
    
    
      She never survived the shock, and when Tom Gerrard made his long journey
      down from North Queensland to Victoria, to comfort and aid his loved
      sister, he found that she had died a month before.
    
    
      It took some months to settle up Captain Gerrard's affairs. He had made a
      will devising his head station to his wife, together with (less a certain
      reservation) the sum of ten thousand pounds. His two other stations       one
      in Central Queensland, and the other in the Far North of that colony,       he
      bequeathed, the former to his "dear daughter, Mary Rayner" and the latter
      to his "son, Thomas Gerrard, together with such moneys as might be at his
      (the testator's) death, lying to the credit of the two stations." Then       and
      here came the sting of the "certain reservation" to Elizabeth Westonley       to
      his "dearly esteemed son-in-law, Edward Westonley, of Marumbah Downs, I
      give and bequeath the sum of one thousand pounds, to be by him used in the
      manner he may deem best for the benefit of the Marumbah Jockey Club, of
      which for ten years he has been patron. To his wife (my daughter
      Elizabeth) I bequeath as a token of my appreciation of her efforts to
      improve the moral condition of illiterate and irreligious bushmen, the sum
      of one thousand pounds, provided that she first consults and has the
      approval of my wife Eleanor, as to the manner in which the said money
      shall be expended."
    
    
      Then, as if to show that despite this gentle sarcasm towards the
      cold-hearted daughter who had never forgiven him for his second marriage,
      and had so long alienated herself from her stepbrother and sister, he
      still bore her a parental affection, he added another clause (also with an
      unintended sting in it) to the effect that if Mrs Westonley should have
      issue, male or female, five thousand pounds was to be invested for her
      first child, to be paid upon coming of age, "also the like sum for the
      first child of my beloved and affectionate daughter, Mary Rayner."
    
    
      "Poor Lizzie!" said Tom Gerrard to his brother-in-law, Westonley, after
      the contents of the will were made known, "she won't be pleased at this, I
      fear, Ted."
    
    
      "She won't, Tom," replied Westonley frankly, as he placed his hand on
      Gerrard's shoulder with a kindly gesture, "but, between you and I, she has
      nothing to be angered at. I am pretty well in, and if I died to-morrow,
      she would be well provided for. And I don't think       I'm not disloyal
      to my wife       I don't think that she was quite as kind as she might
      have been to your mother and to you, and to poor Mary."
    
    
      Of course the death of Mrs Gerrard simultaneously with that of her
      husband, somewhat complicated matters, for she had made no will, and was
      evidently not aware of the nature of that made by Captain Gerrard; for she
      was of too gentle and kindly a nature to have permitted him to have
      written anything that could have aroused a feeling of resentment in the
      mind of his first-born child, although that child, from the day she
      returned from England had treated her with unconcealed hauteur and
      coldness.
    
    
      At last, however, matters were finally settled, and Mrs Westonley,
      although she did resent most bitterly what she called her father's "wicked
      will," consented, at her husband's earnest request, to take charge of and
      educate Mary Rayner's orphan child.
    
    
      "It will be a disgrace to us, Elizabeth, if we send the poor child to
      strangers," Westonley had said to her, almost sternly. "Tom, although he
      is a bachelor, would be overjoyed if we let her go to him."
    
    
      "He is most unfitted to have the care of a child," said Mrs Westonley,
      icily; "from his conversation I should imagine he would be a most decidedly
      improper person."
    
    
      "But he means well, you know; but, like your poor father, he's a bit too
      outspoken and rough. And... and Elizabeth, we have no children of our own,
      and you will get to love the poor little one."
    
    
      "I will make no guarantee as to conferring my affections upon a child
      whose disposition may prove to be utterly unworthy of the tuition and
      Christian training I have undertaken to give her       at your request,"
      was the acidulous reply.
    
    
      Westonley groaned inwardly, but made no answer.
    
    
      A few months after this conversation, Tom Gerrard made a short visit to
      Marumbah Downs to see Westonley and his dead sister's child. He had just
      returned from the little bay near Cape Howe, where the Cassowary
      had been castaway, and where his father, mother, and Dr Rayner had been
      buried, together with all the other passengers and members of the crew
      whose bodies had been washed ashore. After dinner, he, Westonley, and his
      step-sister, were discussing Captain Gerrard's will, when just then there
      came in a neighbour of Westonley's       a squatter named Brooke       who
      was one of the executors. Mrs Westonley received him rather coldly, and
      when Tom Gerrard began describing to him the situation of the place where
      his father and mother were interred, she listened with an ill-concealed
      impatience.
    
    
      "Well! Mrs Westonley," said Brooke, stretching out his spurred and booted
      feet, "your father and mother died together       as they lived, hand in
      hand, and heart to heart."
    
    
      "The late Mrs Gerrard was not my mother."
    
    
      There was a dead silence, and then Tom Gerrard rose, and looked his
      step-sister in the face with undisguised and bitter contempt.
    
    
      "No, thank God! she was not, but she was mine, I am proud to
      say."
    
    
      Then he held out his hand to Westonley, "Good-bye, Ted, I'm leaving."
    
    
      "For heaven's sake, Tom!... Elizabeth, you forget yourself! Oh, I say,
      Brooke, don't let him go."
    
    
      But Tom Gerrard, his heart aflame with anger, pushed Brooke and his
      brother-in-law aside, went to the stables, saddled his horse, and rode off
      to the Marumbah township, fifteen miles away, and next morning Westonley
      received a note.
    
    
      "Dear old Ted,       You and I will always be the same old pals. I know
      you will be kind to Mary's little one, and will write to me from time to
      time, as I shall to you. But I can't forgive Lizzie. You will say I write
      in anger. I do. And yet I am a man quick to forgive an ordinary
      affront, even from a woman. You understand, old boy. TOM."
    
    
      And so for many years, Tom Gerrard kept away from Marumbah, till his
      step-sister and Westonley wrote, and urged him to visit them.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER III
    
    
      Breakfast was served punctually at eight o'clock, and Tom Gerrard, whose
      equanimity was now quite restored, took his seat opposite his sister with
      a smiling face, and in a few minutes, under the sunshine of his genial
      manner, Mrs Westonley, much against her own inclination, began to thaw,
      and presently found herself chatting quite pleasantly with him.
    
    
      "I've sprung myself on you two or three days before you expected me,
      Lizzie, but I'm sure you don't mind."
    
    
      "Indeed no, Thomas. I am very glad I wish Edward was here, but the mailman
      may bring me a letter from him this morning. He said in his last letter he
      would be sure to return home by Saturday, and to-day is Thursday. But what
      brought you here so quickly, Thomas?"
    
    
      "Well, I was very lucky in getting a passage in one of the new Dutch mail
      steamers, instead of having to wait for the slow old Eagle so I
      reached Melbourne a week earlier than I expected. Then at Melbourne I
      caught the steamer for Port Albert, just as she was leaving. At Port
      Albert, instead of waiting two days for the coach for Marumbah, I bought a
      couple of horses, a gun, and some other gear, and came the ninety odd
      miles comfortably, instead of being shaken to pieces in one of Cobb's
      awful coaches."
    
    
      "But what an unnecessary expense, Thomas. The two horses              "
    
    
      "Oh! the whole thing, gun and all included, didn't run into fifty pounds."
    
    
      "Fifty pounds! Oh, Thomas! And your coach fare would have been but three
      pounds! You really are dreadfully extravagant."
    
    
      "Not at all, Lizzie. I shall not lose much in the end. Ted will buy the
      horses, and all the gear from me. I think I can jew him into giving me
      something for them, even if it is only thirty quid."
    
    
      "Thirty what?"
    
    
      "Thirty quid       thirty pounds. Now my dear old Lizzie, don't pretend to
      be shocked at the word 'quid.' You know you've heard all the colonial
      expressions       and poor dad used them pretty frequently."
    
    
      "Indeed he did, Thomas       too frequently, I'm afraid."
    
    
      "Ah, well, Lizzie my dear, it doesn't matter now. By-the-way, doesn't
      little Mary breakfast with you?"
    
    
      "Oh yes, usually; but this morning I told Janet to give her her breakfast
      in her bedroom, then after she has made herself presentable she can join
      us. I'm sure she and that dreadful boy Jim will get you to inspect their
      'cubby house' down on the river bank in the course of the day. Sometimes
      Edward makes me quite cross by the way he yields to their stupid whims. He
      actually spent a whole day in helping them build their precious cubby
      house."
    
    
      Gerrard laughed: "Good old Ted       just as much of a boy as he was
      twenty years ago! But who is this youngster Jim?"
    
    
      "Oh, I quite forgot to tell you about him when we wrote to you. He is
      another of Edward's extravagances. You will remember that when the Cassowary
      was lost, the only survivors were one seaman and a child of four years of
      age. Well, about eight months ago, when Edward was travelling to Sydney in
      the Balclutha, he       as he always does       made the
      acquaintance of every seaman on board. One of them, a quartermaster,
      turned out to be the man who had been washed on shore from the Cassowary.
      Of course Edward was very much interested, and the man, whom he says is a
      very respectable steady person, told him that he had taken care of the
      child, who was his fellow-survivor. Well, the end of it was that Edward
      went to see the boy, and brought him home with him. He will do
      those extraordinary things."
    
    
      "Who were the boy's parents?"
    
    
      "No one knows. Coll, the quartermaster, said that there were a great
      number of steerage passengers on board, and that he remembers seeing a
      young woman and her husband with this child, whom they called Jim, but
      what was their name was never ascertained. It was believed that they were
      newly-arrived emigrants, for no inquiries were made from any quarter about
      them, and so Coll, who seems to be a very kind man, took the child to his
      own home, although he has quite a large family, and actually did not want
      to part with him. Of course, Edward, as usual, went to extremes, and gave
      the Coll family fifty pounds."
    
    
      "It was a generous action, Lizzie," said Gerrard gravely, "and shows him
      to be a good fellow       and a Christian."
    
    
      Mrs Westonley looked at her step-brother in surprise. "But, Thomas, you
      don't seem to understand. These Coll people are really very poor       the
      father, I suppose, earns about seven pounds a month as quartermaster, and
      there are nine children. I think it was ridiculous of Edward giving them
      any money at all, considering the fact that he was lightening their cares
      by taking this boy, Jim, off their hands."
    
    
      "Ah! Lizzie, we don't know. They may have been very fond of the kid       in
      fact they must have been, or they would not have kept him for six
      years, when they could have sent him to the Government Orphanage at
      Parramatta."
    
    
      "I think that is what they should have done."
    
    
      "No, you don't, Lizzie. You would not have let the youngster go into an
      Orphanage had you known of the matter. You have father's heart, Lizzie,
      under that pretty blouse of yours, although you pretend to be so cold, and
      put on the 'keep-off-the-style'       even to me."
    
    
      "I'm not cold-hearted, Thomas."
    
    
      Gerrard rose from his scat, and in another moment, Mrs Westonley found
      herself in his arms, and seated upon his knees.
    
    
      "Now, look here Lizzie," and he kissed her, "I'm going to do my level best
      to please you, for you are my sister. I daresay I have done many things to
      displease you, but I love you, old woman, I do indeed. And whatever I may
      have said in the past I 'take back' as we bushmen say, and I want you to
      give me some of your affection. I know you have tons of it concealed under
      that prim little manner of yours, but you are too proud to show it. And
      see, Lizzie, old girl, I'm not really the reckless scallawag you think me
      to be," and he stroked her hair, and looked so earnestly and pleadingly
      into her eyes, that her woman's heart triumphed, and she leant her head on
      his shoulder.
    
    
      "I never thought you cared for me, Tom," she said "and I daresay that I
      have been to blame in many respects. Edward is one of the best husbands in
      the world, but he is careless and all but irreligious, and I cannot       I
      really cannot change my nature and be anything more than politely civil to
      the friends he sometimes brings here       they are rough, noisy and
      bucolic. I am always urging him to leave a manager at Marumbah and retire
      from squatting altogether. I do not like Australia, and wish to live in
      England, but he will not hear of it, although we have ample means to
      enable us to live in comfort, if not luxury."
    
    
      Gerrard smiled as he gazed around the handsomely furnished room, and,
      mentally compared it with his own rough dining room on his station in the
      Far North.
    
    
      "I should call this a pretty luxurious diggings, Lizzie," he said; "there
      are not many such houses as Marumbah Head Station in Australia."
    
    
      His half-sister shrugged her shoulders. "You should see some of the
      country houses in England, Thomas. And then another reason why I dislike
      bush life is the utter lack of female society."
    
    
      Gerrard raised his brows. "Why, there are the three Gordon girls at Black
      River station, only ten miles away; they certainly struck me as being
      graceful, refined girls."
    
    
      "Mrs Gordon is not a lady, and makes no secret of it. Her father was a
      fishcurer at Inverness, and before that a herring fisher."
    
    
      "But she speaks, acts, and bears herself like a lady," protested Gerrard.
    
    
      "It doesn't matter       she is not one. How Major Gordon, who comes from
      an old Scottish family, could marry her, I cannot understand. She was a
      nursery governess, or something like that."
    
    
      "Yet Gordon seems a very happy man, and the girls              "
    
    
      "The girls are all very well, although too horsey for me. I cannot
      tolerate young women bounding about all over the country after kangaroos,
      in company with a lot of rough men in shirts and moleskins, attending race
      meetings, and calling the Roman Catholic clergyman 'Father Jim' to his
      face. It's simply horrible."
    
    
      "Well! what about Mrs Brooke and Ethel Brooke?" asked Gerrard; "surely
      they are ladies in every sense of the word?"
    
    
      "I admit that they are better than the Gordons, but Ethel Brooke is a
      notorious jilt, and her mother has absolutely no control of her; then Mr
      Brooke himself is more like one of his own stockmen in appearance than a
      gentleman by birth and education."
    
    
      Gerrard looked up at the ceiling       then gave up any further argument
      in despair. "I'll tell you what you want, Lizzie," he said, cheerfully,
      "you want about six months in Melbourne or Sydney."
    
    
      "I detest Melbourne; it is hot, dusty, dirty, noisy, and vulgar."
    
    
      "Then Sydney?"
    
    
      "Of course, I like Sydney; but Edward never will stay there more than a
      week       he is always dying to be back among his cattle and horses."
    
    
      "I'll try my hand with him, and see what I can do with the man," then he
      added,
    
    
      "Now, let us get on with breakfast. Then we'll see this cubby house, and
      I'll diagnose the bear's complaint."
    
    
      As soon as breakfast was over, Mrs Westonley left the room to put on her
      hat, and Gerrard stretched himself out in a squatter's chair on the
      verandah to smoke his pipe. Presently he heard his sister calling, "Jim,
      where are you? I want you."
    
    
      "Yes, Mrs Westonley!" came the reply in a boyish treble, and the owner of
      it wondered what made her voice sound so differently from its usual hard,
      sharp tone.
    
    
      "Jim, come here and see my brother. He, you, and Mary, and I are all going
      down to the cubby house."
    
    
      Suppressing a gasp of astonishment, the boy came to her to where Gerrard
      and she were now sitting.
    
    
      "Thomas, this is Jim."
    
    
      Gerrard jumped up and held out his hand.
    
    
      "How are you, Jim? Glad to see you," and he smiled into the boy's sunburnt
      face. "By Jove! you are a big chap for a ten year old boy. What are you
      going to be       soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, eh?"
    
    
      "I did want to be a sailor, sir; but now I'm going to be a stockman."
    
    
      Gerrard smiled again, and surveyed the boy closely. He was rather tall for
      his age, but not weedy, with a broad sturdy chest, and his face was almost
      as deeply bronzed as that of Gerrard himself, and two big, honest brown
      eyes met his gaze steadily and respectfully; the squatter took a liking to
      him at once, as he had to his sister's child.
    
    
      "Well, Jim, I'm going to stay here a week, and you'll have to tote me
      around, and keep me amused       see? You and Mary between you."
    
    
      "Yes, sir."
    
    
      "Any fish in Marumbah River?"
    
    
      "Lots and lots       two kinds of bream, Murray cod, jew fish, and
      speckled trout, and awful big eels."
    
    
      "Ha! that's good enough. Got fishing lines and hooks?"
    
    
      "Yes, sir."
    
    
      "Then bring 'em along. Where is Mary, Lizzie?"
    
    
      "Here she is," and Mrs Westonley brought her forward, the child's eyes
      dancing with pleasure; "she was too excited to eat any breakfast, until I
      insisted. Thomas, they'll worry you to death. You don't know them."
    
    
      Gerrard threw his feet up in the air, like a boy, and rapped his heels
      together       "I'm fit for anything       from fishing to riding bull
      calves, or cutting out a wild bees' nest from a gum tree a mile high. Oh!
      we're going to have a high old time. I say, Mary, where's the invalid
      Bunny?"
    
    
      "In the saddle-room."
    
    
      "Then come along, and I'll prescribe for the poor, tailless gentleman,"
      and he jumped to his feet. "We shall not be long, Lizzie       are you
      ready?"
    
    
      "I shall be in ten minutes, Thomas," and the children looked wonderingly
      at her, for she actually smiled at them.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IV
    
    
      A few days after the return of the owner of Marumbah Downs, he, with
      Gerrard and the black stockman, Toby, were camped on the bank of a creek
      about thirty miles from the head station. They had started out at daylight
      to muster some of the outlying cattle camps, and now after a hard day's
      riding were stretching themselves out upon the grassy bank to rest, whilst
      Toby was lighting the fire in readiness for supper. On the top of the bank
      the three hardy stockhorses and a packmare, were grazing contentedly on
      the rich green grass, and lying at Westonley's feet were two beautiful
      black-and-tan cattle dogs, still panting with their exertions. The camp
      had been made in a grove of mimosa trees, within a hundred yards of the
      clear waters of the creek, which rippled musically over its rocky bed as
      it sped swiftly to the sea. It wanted an hour to sunset, and already the
      hum of insects was in the air, and a faint cool breeze which had been
      stirring the green graceful fronds of the mimosas, and wafting fleecy
      strips of white across the blue dome above, had died away.
    
    
      In the thick foliage of a cedar tree on the opposite bank, a pheasant and
      his mate were hopping about, uttering their harsh, rude notes; then came a
      whir and whistle of wings and a quick passing shadow overhead as a flock
      of black duck sped over the tree tops to some sandy-banked, reed-margined
      pool near by.
    
    
      Westonley, a big, bushy-bearded man, raised himself on one elbow, and
      watched them disappear; then he called to Toby to take the gun and follow.
    
    
      "What's the use of 'em, Ted?" said Gerrard, as pipe in mouth, and with
      hands clasped under his head, he gazed upwards to the sky. "There's two
      scrub turkeys in the saddle-bags; don't be such a beastly glutton."
    
    
      "You mind your own business, my little man. You like scrub turkey. I
      don't. Give me a black or a wood duck, freshly killed, before all scrub or
      'plain' turkeys in Australia. And move yourself, you useless animal, and
      get one of your turkeys and pluck it while Toby is getting a duck or two.
      Wonderfully intelligent nigger is Toby. I've never yet known him to fail
      in getting me a duck if there was one within a mile. I say, Tommy, d'ye
      like crawfish? This creek here is full of 'em. We'll get some after
      supper."
    
    
      "All right! I'm with you there," said Gerrard, as he pulled out two scrub
      turkeys from the saddle-bags, and then seizing one by the legs, he took
      aim at the broad back of his friend, and the fat, heavy bird struck him
      fairly in the middle of it. The big man never moved, except to carelessly
      put his hand out behind, and taking the turkey, began to pluck it.
    
    
      "Tommy," he said, presently, "d'ye know how to make crawfish soup? It's
      grand!"
    
    
      "Can make it as well as you can, sonny," replied Gerrard, as he sat down
      and began plucking the other bird.
    
    
      "Fearful lot of cubs at the 'Union' now in Sydney," said the older man,
      meditatively. "Hate going into the place. Met the two young Arlingtons
      there the other day, and asked 'em if they were going home to the station.
      'No jolly fear,' said one of the cubs       they have just come back from
      college in England       'we've had enough of Portland Downs and bullock
      punching, branding, and all the rest of the beastly thing.' 'But you'll go
      and see your father?' I asked. 'Well, I don't think so, you know, Mr
      Westonley,' drawled the elder cub, 'it's a beastly long way, and takes
      such a devil of a time to get there       fourteen hundred miles by
      steamer is no joke, and we have to be back in England in five months. So
      the governor is coming down here to have a palaver with us.' It hurt me,
      Tom, to hear these two youngsters talking like that, for Arlington is over
      seventy years of age. And they were good lads until he sent them to
      England to college with more money than was good for them. And it has done
      them harm       made cads of 'em," and he viciously tugged at the wing
      feathers of the bird he was plucking. "Your father used to say that Oxford
      and Cambridge turned out more good men, and more moneyed snobs into the
      world than all the other colleges in the universe."
    
    
      "Daresay," said Tom Gerrard, carelessly, as he began a surgical operation
      on his turkey. "I have heard my father say that old Arlington, who was one
      of the best of the old time squatters, made a mistake in sending those two
      boys home with unlimited money and credit. I suppose they'll turn out
      rotters."
    
    
      "Most likely. And Arlington       by thunder, can't that old fellow of
      seventy ride through scrub       thinks that they will take his place on
      Portland Downs when he dies, and be a credit to the colony. I
      wouldn't have 'em on Marumbah as jackeroos, at a pound a week. But yet
      there is good stuff in them, Tom, and good English blood       the best in
      the world. Hallo! this turkey has eggs; just the very thing for the
      crawfish soup to-morrow."
    
    
      Presently two shots rang out in quick succession.
    
    
      "Toby has got on to 'em," said Westonley; "how do you cook black duck,
      freshly-killed, sonny, when you're camping out?"
    
    
      "Grill 'em."
    
    
      "The whole carcass?"
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      "Well, you must have degrading, greedy customs up in Queensland. Why, the
      only part       but there, I'll show you presently when Toby comes back.
      Tommy!"
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      "This sort of thing is all right, isn't it?" and the big man waved his
      great arm vaguely around his head.
    
    
      "Yes, it's as fine a bit of country as there is anywhere in Australia,"
      replied the younger man, who knew how devoted his companion was to
      Marumbah. "In fact it is all good country on Marumbah. I wish my run was
      half as good. Still I've nothing to grumble at. There are five thousand
      cattle on Ocho Rios now, and it will carry another two thousand easily."
    
    
      Presently Toby appeared carrying three ducks, which he handed to his
      master, who felt them approvingly. "They're all right, Toby. Go and look
      to your fire. Now, Tom, my son, I'll show you the only way to fix up a
      black duck quickly, and correctly as well." Plucking the thick coating of
      feathers off the underneath half of a bird from the lower part of the neck
      down, he made a deep, sweeping curve with his sheath knife, removed the
      entire breast denuded of plumage, and then threw the rest to the dogs. A
      second bird was done the same way, and the two portions were then skewered
      through with a piece of hard, green wood, sprinkled with salt, and handed
      to the black boy, who soon had them frizzling merrily over a glowing fire.
    
    
      Gerrard nodded approval. "Quick, but wasteful, old man. You would never do
      for a cook in a well-regulated household." Then cutting off a large piece
      of the turkey, he skewered it in the same manner, and hung up the rest for
      Toby to eat.
    
    
      Night came swiftly, and, as the two friends ate their supper, and drank
      their strong "billy" tea, the stars came out, and the heavy dew began to
      fall upon the grass. Spreading their blankets under the mimosas, they lit
      their pipes, and with their saddles for pillows, began to discuss various
      matters       the past day's work, the price of fat cattle in Melbourne,
      the late drought in South Australia, and such other all-important subjects
      to Australian pastoralists.
    
    
      Then Gerrard, after describing some of his experiences and troubles with
      the wild blacks on Cape York Peninsula where his station, "Ocho Rios," was
      situated, said:
    
    
      "By the way, Ted. That was a curious thing that you should come across
      that youngster Jimmy, just through having a yarn with a sailor on board
      the Balclutha."
    
    
      "Very curious; no       it's something more than that Tom. It was as if
      the Power above had directed it. This man Coll was one of the
      quartermasters, and only mentioned the Cassowary in the most casual
      manner to me as we were passing the place where she went ashore. 'I was in
      her, sir,' he said in the most simple, matter-of-fact manner, 'and me and
      a poor little boy about four, was the only ones as was saved.'
    
    
      "'Good heavens!' I said, 'you are the one man in the world I wanted
      particularly to meet I went especially to Sydney, but could not find any
      trace of you except your name in the shipping office where you had been on
      the Cassowary as an A.B. And I advertised in all the Australian
      papers for you and the boy, but you seemed to have vanished off the face
      of the earth.'
    
    
      "'It's very easy to explain, sir,' he said. 'As soon as I got to Sydney, I
      went to the Sailors' Home, taking the boy with me. There was hundreds of
      people wanted to take him, but I was too fond of the kid to give him up to
      anyone. I suppose it was wrong of me, seeing as I have a big family of my
      own, which was then living at Newcastle. But I knew the old woman wouldn't
      make too many bones about another mouth to feed.'
    
    
      "Then he went on to say that being afraid the boy would be taken from him
      by some of the many people who wanted to adopt him, he slipped away with
      him one night from the Sailors' Home, and took him on board a collier
      schooner, whose captain he knew, and who was leaving Sydney on the
      following morning for Wellington, New Zealand. The skipper of the vessel
      consented to take Jimmy away with him, and then bring him to Newcastle on
      the return voyage       the collier belonged to, and always loaded at
      Newcastle       and hand him over to Mrs Coll. This was done, and in a few
      months, although Coll was continually asked by people what had become of
      the youngster, he always told the same story       the boy had been
      adopted by a family with plenty of money, whose name he was not at liberty
      to reveal, etc.
    
    
      "Then, of course, I told him that I was the son-in-law of Captain Gerrard,
      whom he remembered perfectly well, as also your mother and poor Rayner. We
      had quite a long talk, and in the end I succeeded in wresting a promise
      from him that if 'the old woman' was agreeable to parting with Jimmy, he
      would also consent.
    
    
      "I went to Newcastle with him and saw his wife, who brought the boy to me.
      He was quite decently dressed, and got into my heart right away... And I
      thought that Lizzie would like him too." His voice dropped, and he ceased
      speaking for a few minutes.
    
    
      "Well, I had a hard struggle to induce the worthy woman to give him up,
      but in the end she consented. Then I talked about little Mary, and how
      happy the two would be together, and that it would not be natural for two
      children who had been rendered orphans by the same dreadful calamity to be
      separated. The poor creature's face was streaming with tears when she at
      last consented. 'It's no for the sake o' the money I pairt wi' the bairn.
      It's little he costs me, an' my own children will be sore at heart for
      many a lang day after he goes!'.. But she recognised that it would be
      wrong of her to refuse       and so the matter was fixed up."
    
    
      "Good old Ted!"
    
    
      "Well       keep this dark from Lizzie, old man       I gave 'em a cheque
      for two hundred and fifty pounds."
    
    
      Gerrard's clear laugh. "Poor Lizzie! She thinks you gave them fifty pounds
      only."
    
    
      "Just so, just so       you see, old man, Lizzie isn't a bit mean       and
      she doesn't know that I am as well in as I am, so I told her a fifth of
      the truth. I said that fifty pounds was a great help to a hard-working man
      with a large family."
    
    
      "Cunning beggar!"
    
    
      "Then, as Coll struck me as being a downright, straightforward man, who
      had a pretty stiff pull of it to bring up and educate his children
      decently on seven pounds a month       seaman's wages.       I got him a
      berth as wharfinger to a steamship company at twelve pounds, and he was
      made as happy as a sandboy, I can tell you: Lizzie knows that much, for I
      told her. And she lets the youngster write to the Colls now and then."
    
    
      "Does she?" said Gerrard, dryly. He could not help it. Then he sat up, and
      re-filled his pipe.
    
    
      "Ted, old chap, I like that youngster. Let me have him and take him to
      Ocho Rios with me. I want little Mary most, but know you won't part with
      her, and even if you would, a cattle station in the Far North is no place
      for a girl. But let me have the boy. I'll be good to him."
    
    
      Westonley made no answer at first. Then he said slowly, "I'll tell you in
      the morning, Tom. Good-night."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER V
    
    
      Soon after sunrise, as the two friends were drinking their morning tea ere
      they started back for Marumbah, Westonley told Gerrard that he had decided
      to let him take Jim away with him to Ocho Rios.
    
    
      "He is provided for in my will, Tom, but you must never let him know it. I
      think it is a mistake to let youngsters know that they will have money
      left to them some day."
    
    
      "Quite so, Ted. And I am sure that you will never regret letting me have
      him, and I will bring him up as if he were my own son. There is no school
      within two hundred miles of Ocho Rios, but I think I am quite capable of
      giving him a decent education."
    
    
      "Little Mary won't like it, Tom. She is passionately fond of him, and will
      cut up very rough over the parting, I fear."
    
    
      "Poor child! But, of course, she will see him again in a few years. I can
      see, that next to you, Jim is her 'dearest and best.' If I were a married
      man, Ted, I would ask you for her as well. Every time she looks at me with
      those big, soft eyes of hers, I see poor Mary again, and when she speaks,
      hear the soft sweet voice again."
    
    
      "She is a lovable child, and, look here, Tom, old man, I'll tell you
      something that has made me grizzle in secret for many years       Lizzie
      doesn't care for her. I don't mind her being a bit sharp with the boy how
      and then, for he's a terrible young Turk at times, and I'm too easy with
      him; but little Mary is such a gentle, soft sort of kid, that I wonder how
      anyone could possibly help loving her. But, somehow or other, Lizzie
      doesn't. Still, within the last few days       ever since you came in fact       she
      has been a bit warmer in her manner."
    
    
      Gerrard nodded. "Lizzie will come round to like her in time, Ted, And, I
      say, old fellow, since you have been so open with me, I'm going to say
      something to you that you perhaps may not like, and think I'm an
      interfering ass. But, 'honest Injun,' Ted, I mean well       like a good
      many other idiots do when they meddle with other people's domestic
      affairs."
    
    
      "Go on, sonny," said the big man, quietly, "you never talk rot."
    
    
      "Well, it's this. Lizzie is simply fretting her life out at Marumbah, and
      I think that, in a way, you are to blame. She does not like living in the
      bush, and does not seem to care for the people hereabout. I had quite a
      long yarn with her the first day I came to Marumbah, and although at first
      she tried to be the stiff, austere lady with me, I wouldn't have it. Made
      her sit on my knee, and all that, you know, stroked her hair, and pinched
      her pretty little nose."
    
    
      "Tom, if I didn't know you better, I would call you a liar."
    
    
      "Fact! You know as well as I do that she has always looked upon me as a
      black sheep. But she is going to change her mind about me, and I'll bet
      you a fiver that before I leave Marumbah, I'm going to be 'Tommy' to her,
      as I was in the old, old days."
    
    
      Westonley's sun-tanned face flushed with pleasure. "Tom, I'd give half of
      all I'm worth to see her and you friends again. I know how bitterly she
      affronted you years ago."
    
    
      "Oh! that is all forgotten, old son. I was to blame for going off in such
      a silly huff. I behaved like a bear. We men don't understand women, Ted,
      and make hideous fools of ourselves. And that brings me to what I wanted
      to tell you       which is, that you are a blazing idiot."
    
    
      "Tom, whatever you say, and whatever cheek you give me, I will take it
      quietly, although I could knock you out in four rounds," and Westonley
      thumped Gerrard affectionately on his back with his great hand. "Now, I
      know I'm a thundering ass but I'll be as meek as a lamb to you, you
      black-faced, under-sized little beggar."
    
    
      Gerrard laughed. There was a difference of four inches in their respective
      heights; Westonley being six feet two inches. He knew by the inflection of
      the big man's voice that he had become a much happier man within the last
      ten minutes, and the knowledge of it gave him a great satisfaction.
    
    
      "I may not be as big as you," he said, "but if I was the same shape, I'd
      go to a bush carpenter, and get him to trim me down with an adze." Then
      after this jest, he resumed seriously. "Well, Ted, it is just this. Lizzie
      says that she likes Sydney but you do not, and that you will never stay
      there for more than a week at a time. Now, that isn't doing the square
      thing by her. You and I as well, never think that the many years she spent
      in England gave her a taste for many of the refinements of civilisation       pictures,
      high-class music, especially Churchy music, and all kind of things like
      that, which are always dear to a highly-educated and naturally clever
      woman, Now, when she married you, and settled down to a station life, she
      gave up a good deal, and as the years go on, she feels it more and more,
      and no woman in the world can always be an angel, you know, although we
      tell 'em so when we ask 'em to marry us. Do you follow me?"
    
    
      "I'm listening for all I'm worth, my son. If we were in a room, you could
      distinctly hear the wall paper adhering to the wall."
    
    
      "Well, now, as I was saying, that isn't fair to Lizzie. What is the use of
      her going to Sydney for a week? Just as she is beginning to enjoy herself,
      and feel something of the life she had in England, you drag her back to
      Marumbah to your beastly bullock punching."
    
    
      "But I don't want her to come, Tom. I've always urged her to stay there
      for three months       or six, if she liked."
    
    
      "Bosh! What pleasure would she have in being there alone; for although a
      woman may have lots of women friends, she's practically alone if her
      husband isn't with her. Tumble?"
    
    
      Westonley nodded. "Go on, Tommy, go on to a dead finish. I am beginning to
      see I'm in fault."
    
    
      "Of course you are. And if you don't give her a long change in Sydney, and
      stay there with her, you'll feel sorry for it; she'll become a religious
      monomaniac, and go in for High Church, auricular confession, and an empty
      stomach on Fridays. She's got a turn that way, remember. A conventual
      education in a High Church school in England isn't a very healthy
      preparation for a girl who afterwards marries a hulking, horse-racing,
      hard-riding Australian squatter."
    
    
      "What am I to do?" asked Westonley.
    
    
      "Take her to Sydney next week. We'll all go together, little Mary
      included, and I'll stay with you for a couple of months. I'll stand half
      the racket."
    
    
      "Shut up! Do you think I can't run Lizzie, little Mary, and myself without
      you chipping in?"
    
    
      "All right!" and Gerrard, secretly delighted, but showing no sign of it,
      went on placidly: "you see, Ted, you have a good man in Black" (head
      stockman at Marumbah). "What he doesn't know about cattle isn't worth
      knowing, and there's no need for you to come tearing back for mustering,
      and branding, and attending to things generally. D'ye think that if you
      died to-morrow the cattle would go into mourning, and would refuse 'to
      increase and multiply'? No one in this world is indispensable, although
      everyone thinks he is, and that, when he pegs out, the Universe is going
      to fall into serious trouble. Now, that's all I have to say. Are you
      satisfied I'm talking sense?"
    
    
      "Sonny, it's all right. I'll do any blessed thing you want, although I
      hate the idea of leaving Marumbah to loaf about in Sydney for six months,"
      and the big man gripped Gerrard by his pointed beard, and tugged it
      affectionately. "I can see that I have thought too much of myself and too
      little of others."
    
    
      "Not a bit; you were only thinking of Marumbah. Ted, old man, I think I'll
      come back next year, and well see the Melbourne Cup together, hey?"
    
    
      "Its a deal! If you don't come, I'll              "
    
    
      "Kick me when I do come. Time we were off home, fatty."
    
    
      Just about midnight, as Gerrard lay on his bed reading, he heard a low
      sound of sobbing from little Mary's room, which adjourned his own. He rose
      quietly, stepped to her door, and gently opened it.
    
    
      The child was in her nightdress, leaning out of the window, with her hands
      outstretched to the night.
    
    
      "Oh Jim, Jim, dear Jim! I wish Uncle Tom had never come to Marumbah. He
      must be a godless and wicked man to take you away from me when I love you.
      I hate him, I hate him!"
    
    
      Gerrard went back to his room, lit his pipe and walked out on to the
      verandah, and paced slowly up and down, thinking.
    
    
      "I wish I had 'em both," he said to himself.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VI
    
    
      The charming little town of Bowen, on the shores of the beautiful harbour
      named Port Denison, was in the zenith of its glory and prosperity. There
      were certainly other towns in the north of Queensland       Mackay for
      instance       which enjoyed the advantage of being nearer the capital,
      and so obtaining more consideration from the Treasury; but Bowen, although
      six hundred miles from Brisbane, was the most thriving town in the north,
      and affected a haughty indifference to her rivals for supremacy, such as
      the "sugar" growing towns of Bundaberg and Mackay to the south, and the
      vulgar, upstart, and newly-founded Townsville to the north.
    
    
      "With our matchless harbour, surpassed only on this island continent by
      that of Sydney," said the Port Denison Clarion, in one of its
      inspired and lofty-languaged leaders, "we can regard with a serene, yet
      not discourteous or contemptuous indifference, the statements of our
      esteemed, though hasty contemporary, the Mackay Planters' Friend,
      that Bowen may yet find that the newly-founded hamlet of Townsville on the
      shores of Cleveland Bay will ere long usurp the claim of beautiful Bowen
      to be the natural entrepôt for all that vast extent of territory to
      the northward and the westward of Port Denison, and which, ere many
      decades have passed, will, through its marvellous agricultural, pastoral,
      and auriferous resources, add not a jewel but a confiscation of blazing
      and lustrous gems of the most priceless value to the already glorious
      crown of that noble lady upon whose Empire the sun never sets. Townsville
      is simply a collection of humpies and shanties built upon an ill-smelling
      mud bank. We have personally satisfied ourselves that unless some
      enterprising British capitalist can convert the only available possession
      of Townsville (which is mud, and bad mud at that) into bricks, which,
      perhaps, may be used for the minor classes of buildings which must of
      necessity soon be built for the accommodation of the poorer classes of
      working men who, in their thousands, will soon be established in Bowen,
      Townsville will no more prove a factor towards the development of this
      great country of North Queensland than the numerous alligators in the
      Burdekin River will be employed by the municipality of Bowen as paid
      scavengers, and be provided brass badges, dust shovels, and other such
      implements to denote their vocation. As for the other assertions of the
      editor of the Planters Friend, we, with all kindliness, should like
      to point out that the Friend is the organ of the Sugar Planters; it
      sees nothing beyond Sugar; Sugar is its God, its Mokanna, and
      (incidentally) we may remark that Rum is a product resulting from the
      manufacture of the saccharine plant, and we fear that many samples of this
      aromatic liquid may have found their way into the editorial sanctum of our
      esteemed and valued contemporary in Mackay. At least, we judge so when a
      dirty, ill-smelling mud bank is compared with one of the most noble
      evidences of God's handiwork       Port Denison!"
    
    
      To such a courteous reproof as this, the Planters' Friend would
      invariably make the same reply in the form of a leaderette of ten or
      twenty lines, enclosed in a square of black to denote mourning:
    
    
      "Our esteemed Bowen contemporary has 'got 'em' again. We are sorry we
      cannot #do any more than again, in the most kindly spirit, urge him to try
      the Dr Jordan cure, an advertisement of which will be found on page 3. We
      have personal knowledge of a case of the rescue from utter wreck and
      degradation of one of the brightest intellects of the present century by
      the use of the Jordan system; and as the price is but trifling, it should
      be within easy access of our squatter-adoring contemporary."
    
    
      To these vaguely-worded, funereal-encompassed remarks, the Clarion
      would retort:
    
    
      "No one who believes in the trite but, nevertheless, all-powerfully true
      assertion that the Press is the Archimidean lever which moves the world,
      cannot but regret the unblushing statement of the editor of our esteemed
      contemporary, the Planters' Friend, that he has been the victim of
      a soul-destroying, home-wrecking, and accursed habit, which that gifted
      American, Colonel Robert Ingersoll, has, in words of fiery eloquence,
      called 'the treacherous, insidious murderer of home and happiness; the
      Will-o'-the-Wisp that draws honour, genius, and all that is good into its
      fatal, deadly quagmire.' To the assertion that our valued contemporary is
      'the possessor of one of the brightest intellects of the present century'
      (as he so modestly informs us) we do not cavil at for one moment. But even
      the patients under the Jordan (American quack) system may have relapses;
      and, when the Planters' Friend can calmly publish two columns of
      leaded matter insinuating that a mud bank on the shores of Cleveland Bay
      is to become the leading port of North Queensland, we can but regretfully
      infer that the Jordan cure is not entirely satisfactory, and that even the
      'brightest intellects' suffer terrible and deplorable relapses."
    
    
      These journalistic amenities were accorded serious attention by the
      society of Bowen, which, by reason of the many Government officials
      established there, considered itself very exclusive. The majority of these
      officials were connected with the law, for Bowen was the proud possessor
      of not only a resident judge, but also a new courthouse of such ample
      dimensions that the whole population of the town could have been
      accommodated therein. How the numerous barristers, solicitors, and the
      smaller legal fry lived was a mystery. Perhaps, like the mythical French
      town whose population supported themselves by doing each other's washing,
      the legal gentry of Bowen existed by performing each other's clerical
      work. Next in numbers       though not in social standing       were the
      Government officials connected with the Harbour and Lights Department, and
      "The Jetty." The Jetty was one of Bowen's triumphs; was over a quarter of
      a mile long, cost twenty thousand pounds to build, and was costing four
      thousand pounds a year to keep in order, and enable the staff of
      engineers, inspectors, etc., to dress in a gentlemanly style, and maintain
      their prestige as officials of higher importance than the Customs
      officers, of whom Bowen was provided with six, all dressed very
      becomingly, and all more or less related to members of the Queensland
      Cabinet       as a matter of fact it would have been a difficult task to
      find any male person in the Government service in Bowen       from His
      Honour Judge Coker to Paddy Shea, the letter-carrier, who was not
      connected with, or did not owe his position to a member of the Ministry.
      And Bowen revelled in the knowledge that Brisbane and the Legislature
      dared not refuse Bowen any reasonable request, for already there was a
      dark rumour concerning Separation       the division of the colony into
      North and South       and the Clarion had warned the "inert and
      muddling Government" of the colony "that unless the just and courteous
      request of the telegraphic staff of the Bowen Repeating Office for a
      punkah is acceded to without further circumlocution, the growing movement
      in favour of Separation will be openly advocated by this journal. Already
      (of this we have private knowledge) has Lord Kimberley expressed himself
      astonished at the heartless refusal of our benighted Colonial Secretary
      and Treasurer to grant the insignificant sum of two hundred pounds to the
      necessitous widow of Samuel Wilson, who was killed by being run over by a
      trolley on our beautiful jetty. Does the Colonial Secretary know the
      meaning of the word Nemesis? Let him ponder!"
    
    
      The appearance of Bowen at this time of latent agitation for Separation
      and open and undisguised animosity to the "upstart collection of humpies
      on a mud bank in Cleveland Bay," was pleasing in the extreme. Wide,
      tree-planted, grassy streets, kept scrupulously clean, handsomely-built
      bungalows, enclosed in gardens containing tropical and sub-tropical plants
      (the residences of the officials and their families), a court-house and
      other public buildings of such size and ornate construction that they
      surpassed those of any other town in the colony, except the capital; an
      environment of back country grateful to look upon, and a harbour of
      surpassing beauty.
    
    
      The editor of the Clarion despite his inflated leaders, was a
      thoroughly sensible man, who fully recognised the potentialities of the
      port, and yet saw that it was doomed to sink into comparative
      insignificance, and that the "collection of humpies on a mud bank" was to
      be the future capital of the Far North. But he struggled on gamely. He was
      a genial, merry-hearted old bachelor, who had once loved his paper as a
      mother loves her one child, and had spent his capital of two thousand
      pounds in trying to keep the town alive as long as possible. A refined,
      highly-educated man, he was obliged       after two years' bitter
      financial experience       to resort to the type of journalism prevalent
      amongst Australian country newspapers; otherwise he could not have made a
      living. But he despised the very people for whom he was apparently
      fighting so strenuously, and often savagely reproached himself for having
      turned aside from the straight path.
    
    
      "Thank Heaven, I'm not married!" he said to himself one evening, as
      throwing himself down upon a couch in his bedroom at the Queen's Hotel, he
      began to glance through a bundle of exchanges which he had brought from
      the office, and in a few minutes a smile spread over his face, as he read
      the following in the Rockhampton Bulletin:
    
    
      "The Bowen Clarion is making a game effort to bolster up that
      little tin-pot township with its coterie of highly-paid, useless
      officials, who for six years past have battened on the public revenues. It
      was the misfortune of a representative of this journal to be obliged to
      spend two weeks in Port Denison not long since, and his terse description
      of the spot and its inhabitants deserves a place in the guide book of the
      colony which has yet to be written. Bowen is a delightfully laid-out town
      on the shores of Port Denison. It is inhabited by some six hundred people       mostly
      official loafers and spongers of the worst type. The community consists of
      boozy squatters, snobbish wives of snobbish officials, anaemic old maids,
      obsequious tradesmen on the verge of insolvency, and two respectable and
      hard-working persons       the latter are Chinamen. The 'tony' society of
      Bowen is about as lively and intelligent as that of a decaying Cathedral
      town in the old country. The atmosphere of matchless snobbery and
      vulgarity that pervades Bowen can be perceived by the passing voyager many
      miles out at sea."
    
    
      "By Jove! he's not far wrong," commented the editor, as putting down the
      paper he took up another, and had just ripped off the the cover, when the
      chambermaid tapped at the door, then entered with a card.
    
    
      "The gentleman wishes to see you particularly, sir."
    
    
      He took the card from the tray, and read,
    
    
      THOMAS GERRARD. Ocho Rios.
    
    
      beneath was written, "Urgently desires to see the editor of the Clarion
      on business of importance."
    
    
      "Ask him to come in, Milly," he said as he kicked a chair into position.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VII.
    
    
      "How do you do, Mr Gerrard?" he said, as with outstretched hand he met his
      visitor at the door. "I am glad to meet Ted Westonley's brother-in-law at
      last. How is he?"
    
    
      "Very well, indeed, when I last saw him," replied Gerrard, as he sat down,
      and Lacey rang the bell.
    
    
      "I have not seen him for ten years," said the editor. "Ah, here you are, M
      illy! What will you take, Mr Gerrard? You must excuse my rig" (he was in
      his pyjamas); "but it's so infernally hot that I always get into these the
      minute I'm back in my room. When did you arrive?"
    
    
      "Only an hour ago, in the Tinonee."
    
    
      "Going back to your station, I suppose? By the way, aren't you       or is
      it Jardine?       who is the 'furthest north' cattle man?"
    
    
      "Jardine; but his station is on the east side. I'm on the west; the Gulf
      side, between the Batavia River and Duyfhen Point."
    
    
      Lacey looked admiringly at the well-knit figure and handsome, tanned face
      of his visitor. "Well, the climate up there can't be as bad as it is
      painted. I never saw a man look better than you do."
    
    
      "Oh! the climate doesn't hurt me now. I've had my share of fever of
      course; so has everyone on Ocho Rios. The niggers are our chief trouble."
    
    
      "Ah! no doubt. By the way, Aulain, of the Black Police is down here on
      sick leave. He'll be glad to see you."
    
    
      "And I him. He's a fine fellow, isn't he?"
    
    
      "A whiter man       or a better gentleman       never put foot in a
      stirrup. I've got to like him very much. And he thinks no end of you. Says
      you're the best scrub rider he ever saw."
    
    
      Gerrard laughed. "'Praise from him is praise indeed.' All I can say is
      that I have never seen anyone who can go through scrub or thick timber
      like Randolph Aulain. Where is he staying?"
    
    
      "Here       at the Queen's. He's had a terrible time with fever, and can't
      do more than sit up. We'll go and see him presently."
    
    
      "Oh, yes! But I want to speak to you on a matter of some importance first.
      That is why I have ventured to come to your hotel. I did go to the Clarion
      office, but just missed you."
    
    
      "I'm only too delighted to see you, even if you were not Westonley's
      brother-in-law. You know that he and I were at Rugby together, and then at
      Oxford? But, before I say anything else, when does your steamer leave?"
    
    
      "This afternoon at four o'clock; but I am not going on in her. I'm in
      somewhat of a hole, and I felt sure you would assist me."
    
    
      "Indeed I will. I'm not flush. This blessed rag of mine doesn't pay, but I
      can raise a hundred from the bank here."
    
    
      Gerrard laughed. "No, not that, Mr Lacey. I'm not 'broke,' and it is not
      money I want. At the same time I appreciate your generosity. Ted has often
      told me you would do any mortal thing for a friend in need." He paused,
      and then began, "Mr Lacey              "
    
    
      "Drop the 'Mr' please."
    
    
      "Well, then, Lacey, I want your advice and assistance. Do you know any
      decent family here who would take care of a boy of eleven years of age for
      about a fortnight?"
    
    
      The editor of the Clarion tugged thoughtfully at his long, white
      moustache for a few moments. "Yes, I think I do know of such a family. I
      used to board with them when I first came to this infernal hole. Their
      name is Woodfall. The father is a dairyman here, and a very decent
      hard-working man. His wife is a thoroughly, good honest woman, and they
      have no children. I think they would be suitable people; and I'm sure
      would look after the boy very well. Where is he?"
    
    
      "On board the steamer, just now, waiting for me. I'll tell you how I'm
      fixed. The youngster is an orphan who was living with my brother-in-law at
      Marumbah. I took a great fancy to him, and as my sister did not care much
      for the young 'un, though Ted did, I persuaded Ted to let me have him to
      'father.' I should have liked to have had my poor sister Mary's little
      girl       you know that my sister died soon after her husband and my
      father and mother all went together in the Cassowary       but, of
      course, I couldn't bring her away from civilisation       there's no white
      woman within two hundred miles of Ocho Rios." Then he went on telling his
      host the history of Jim, from the time Westonley had brought him away from
      Newcastle to the present. Lacey listened with interest.
    
    
      "Well, a few weeks ago in Sydney I met a Mrs Tallis, a widow. Her husband
      was a squatter, and died a few months ago in Sydney."
    
    
      "I knew him. His station is called Kaburie       it is between here and
      Mackay       and is a rattling good cattle run."
    
    
      "Yes. She wants to sell it. I suppose the poor little woman doesn't like
      going back to the place now. However now I'm coming to the point I've an
      idea that it might suit me as a breeding station, and told her I would
      stop at Bowen, and go and look at it. Now it would suit me very well if I
      could leave my protégé here for a couple of weeks, as the young
      scamp has managed to sprain his wrist on board, and so can't very well
      come with me, though I should like to take him very much."
    
    
      "The Woodfalls will take him, I'm sure. And I will look after him as well.
      Now, will you come and see Aulain for a few minutes? Then I'll take you up
      to Mrs Woodfall."
    
    
      Aulain, a strikingly handsome, slightly-built, olive-faced man, with
      jet-black beard and moustache, was delighted to see Gerrard.
    
    
      "Hallo! old 'Tom-and-Jerry,' I'm glad to see you again. Sit down and tell
      me o' the wondrous sights o' Sydney and Melbourne. Heavens, man, I wish I
      could get away down South for six months."
    
    
      They remained talking for half an hour, during which time Gerrard told
      Aulain the reason of his stopping at Bowen.
    
    
      "By Jove! old fellow, I shall be glad if you buy Kaburie, for you'll have
      to put in some of your time there, of course, and I've applied for a
      removal from the Cape York District to Port Denison. I'm sick to death of
      nigger chasing in the Far North, and want to be somewhere where I can feel
      I'm not entirely an outcast from the world, with no one to talk to but my
      own black troopers, any one of whom would put a bullet into my back if I
      turned rusty."
    
    
      "Oh, well, I think it is pretty certain I shall buy Mrs Tallis's station.
      I like Ocho Rios very well, but now, since this last trip of mine South, I
      feel as you do       I want to be a little less out of the world. I might,
      perhaps, sell Ocho Rios, and fix myself at Kaburie. If I don't, I'll put a
      manager there, and keep the place going, for I have a great belief that
      there will be some rich gold discoveries in the Batavia River country
      before long       and thousands of meat-hungry diggers means pots of money
      to a cattleman."
    
    
      "I'm certain, too, that there will be some big fields opened up that way
      soon," said Aulain. "In that valise of mine, there under the bed, are
      three or four ounces of alluvial gold which my troopers and I washed out
      in one day at the head of a little creek running into the Batavia."
    
    
      "Place with a hunking big boulder standing up in the middle of a deep
      pool, with a lot of fish in it?" queried Gerrard.
    
    
      "Yes; but how the deuce did you come across it? I've never seen a beast of
      yours within fifty miles of it       the country is too rough even for
      cattle       and I thought that my troopers and I were the first that ever
      saw the place."
    
    
      "When were you there?"
    
    
      "About a month after you left Ocho Rios for Sydney."
    
    
      "Well, my dear little laddie, I was there a year ago, camped there for a
      couple of days, and did a little washing out       with two quart billy
      cans for a dish."
    
    
      "Get anything?"
    
    
      "Seven ounces, sonny; mostly in coarse gold too."
    
    
      Aulain whistled. "And you never went back there?"
    
    
      "No! I never had the time for one thing; another reason was that it would
      not have paid me to have left my station for the sake of a few hundred
      pounds' worth of gold, and thirdly, although I know a little about
      alluvial mining, I don't know anything about reefing       wouldn't know a
      gold-bearing reef from a rank duffer, unless I saw the gold sticking up in
      it in lumps. And there are several parties of prospectors up in Cape York
      Peninsula now, and some of them are sure to make their way to the Batavia
      River country in the course of time. If any come to my place I'll give
      them all the help I can. I'd like to see a really good gold-field
      discovered near Ocho Rios; it would mean thousands of pounds to me."
    
    
      "Of course it would. But, I say, Gerry, old fellow," and here Aulain
      paused. "Will you do me a favour? Oh, no, hang it!" and he stopped
      suddenly.
    
    
      "What is it, Aulain?"
    
    
      The Inspector's sallow face flushed. "I don't think it is fair to ask you,
      as it will perhaps affect your interests."
    
    
      "Don't be an ass! What is it?"
    
    
      Lacey rose, thinking that Aulain hesitated to speak on account of him
      being present, but Aulain begged him to stay, and then said:
    
    
      "Well, I'll tell you what it is, Gerry. Will you keep it dark about that
      little creek up there; for six months anyway."
    
    
      "Certainly, I will."
    
    
      "You see, Gerry, it's this way. I'm sick to death of life in the Black
      Police, and as soon as I get over this fever, I think I'll resign and try
      my luck at mining. I can't live on my salary, and I have no backstair's
      influence in Brisbane to get me anything better in the Government service;
      and only this morning I was thinking of that very place where we both got
      gold. There are reefs all about the head of that creek, and every one of
      them carries payable gold. And so if you will keep it dark I stand a good
      chance of not only getting the usual Government reward of five thousand
      pounds for the discovery of a payable gold-field, but can peg out my
      reward claim beforehand."
    
    
      "My dear old chap, I shall be only too pleased. And, look here, why not
      send in your resignation right away, and then after I've finished this
      business at Kaburie, come away with me. There will be a steamer here in a
      fortnight, which will take us to Somerset, and from there we can get to
      Ocho Rios in one of the pearling luggers. We shall find plenty of them
      lying up at Somerset at this time of the year, and it will be a better and
      easier way of getting to my place than having to buy horses at Somerset,
      and travelling a hundred and fifty miles across the peninsula."
    
    
      Aulain shook his head. "It is a very tempting offer, Gerry; but I can't
      accept it. I am obliged to wait six months after sending in my resignation
      before I can leave the service; it is a hard and fast rule."
    
    
      "I'm awfully sorry, Aulain," said Gerrard; "however, when you do come, you
      will, of course, make my place your headquarters. Don't buy any horses
      when you get to Somerset; I can lend you all you want. Now I must be off
      with Lacey. I'll see you when I get back from Kaburie in a week or ten
      days, and we'll have long yarns together, as I shall remain in Bowen until
      the next steamer for Somerset calls."
    
    
      "Right! Oh, by-the-way, Gerry, on your way to Kaburie you will have to
      pass a little mining camp called Fraser's Gully. Will you leave a letter
      there for me? I'll have it written by the time you come back from
      Woodfalls."
    
    
      As soon as Lacey and Gerrard were out in the street, the latter returned
      to his companion with a smile. "So you are to play Mercury for Aulain?"
    
    
      "Am I? Who is she?"
    
    
      "A Miss Kate Fraser. Her father is a friend of mine, and Aulain and she
      are engaged       at least I think so. But I have heard that there is a
      parson in the running, and I don't wonder       for she is a splendid
      girl."
    
    
      A walk of a mile brought them to Wood fall's house. Both Woodfall and his
      wife were at home, and Lacey at once entered into the subject of Jim.
    
    
      "Certainly, Mr Gerrard, we'll take the boy and be glad to have him. But we
      won't take payment," said Mrs Woodfall, a big-shouldered woman with a
      pleasant, sunburnt face. "Joe, get the buggy, and I'll drive down to the
      steamer at once with Mr Gerrard."
    
    
      Two hours later, Jim was installed at the Woodfall's, and Gerrard was on
      his way to Kaburie.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VIII
    
    
      Along one of the many densely-wooded spurs of Cape Conway, which rears its
      bold front from out the pale green waters of Repulse Bay, a young girl was
      riding a wild-eyed, long-maned and sweating bay filly, which, newly broken
      in, had been making the most frantic efforts to unseat its rider, whose
      dark brown hair, escaping from under the light Panama hat she wore, had
      fallen down upon her shoulders.
    
    
      At the summit of the spur there was an open grassy space, free of timber,
      and commanding a view seaward, and along the coast north and south for
      many miles. Here the girl drew rein and dismounted, deftly whipped her
      hair into a loose coil, quickly took off the saddle, placed it, seat down,
      upon the ground so that it might dry under the hot sun, and then slipping
      the bit from the horse's mouth, let the animal graze with loose bridle.
    
    
      "There, my fractious young lady," she said, "you can feed, and as you
      feed, I hope you will consider the error of your ways, and give up any
      more attempts to buck me off. You ought to know me better by this time."
    
    
      From a leather saddle-bag she took out some slices of beef and damper, and
      leisurely began to eat, her dark brown eyes dreamily scanning the blue sea
      before her, and then resting on the green, verdured hills of Whitsunday
      Island, away to the northward, with little beaches of shining white
      nestling at the heads of many a quiet bay, whose shores were untrodden,
      except by the feet of the black and savage aborigines inhabiting the
      mainland. Far out to sea, and between Whitsunday Passage and the Great
      Barrier Reef, the white sails of five pearling luggers were glinting in
      the sun as they sailed northward to the scene of their labours in the wild
      waters of New Guinea and Torres Straits.
    
    
      "I wonder how many of those on board will return," mused the girl aloud as
      she watched the little vessels       which looked no larger than swans.
      "How many will come back rich, how many disappointed and yet not
      undaunted, ever hopeful, ever daring, ever eager to sail once more, and
      face danger and death; death day by day and night by night for two long
      weary years. And yet       oh, I wish I were a man. I believe I am a man       a
      man in heart and will and strength of mind and body, and yet a woman. And
      for father's sake I ought to have been born a boy." She sighed, and
      leaning her chin on her hand gazed longingly at the tiny fleet and wished
      she       a man       were at the tiller of one of the luggers, listening
      to the tales of the bronze-faced, bearded pearl-shellers; tales of mighty
      pearls worth thousands of pounds, of fierce encounters with the
      treacherous savages of New Guinea, and the mainland of Australia; of
      fearful hurricanes and dreadful dangers ashore and afloat, and then
      peaceful, happy days of rest in the far-away isles of Eastern Polynesia;
      before the newly-discovered beds of pearl shell in Torres Straits lured
      them away from the calm seas and palm-clad atolls of the Paumotus and
      Manahiki and Tongarewa.
    
    
      The grazing filly suddenly raised her shapely head and pricked up her
      ears, and listened; and, in an instant, the girl sprang up and took a
      Smith and Wesson revolver from her saddle. The blacks about Repulse Bay
      and Whitsunday Passage had an evil reputation, and many an unfortunate
      stockman or digger had been slaughtered by them when camped in apparent
      security; even within a few score miles of such towns as Bowen and Mackay.
    
    
      With the filly she listened, and then smiled as she heard the sound of a
      horse's feet coming along the track through the scrub. In a few moments
      horse and rider appeared, and the girl slipped her weapon into the pocket
      of her short riding skirt.
    
    
      "How do you do, Miss Fraser?" cried the newcomer as he jumped off his
      horse and hurried up to her with outstretched hand and an eager light in
      his eyes; "this is a pleasant surprise. I was on my way to see your
      father, and when riding along the beach below caught sight of your filly
      feeding on the bluff. I knew that it could be no one but you who would
      camp here, so instead of going on to Fraser's Gully, I turned off; and
      here I am."
    
    
      "And I am very glad to see you, Mr Forde," said the girl, as she shook
      hands; "now, will you have something to eat? I have plenty of Fraser's
      Gully fare here       beef and damper       and I've tea and sugar in my
      saddle-bag."
    
    
      "So have I. And now, whilst I light a fire, tell what brought you here
      to-day? To look at the sea       the 'ever treacherous sea'       I
      suppose, and 'wish you were a man,'" and the speaker smiled into the brown
      eyes.
    
    
      "You are very rude, Mr Forde; the rudest clergyman I ever met Certainly,
      I've only met three in my life, but then              " Here the brown
      eyes lit up laughingly. "They were different from you."
    
    
      "I have no doubt about it," and the man laughed like a boy, as taking up
      some dead sticks he broke them across his knee. "But you haven't told me
      how it is I am so fortunate as to find you here       fifteen miles off
      the track to Fraser's Gully."
    
    
      "Oh! the old story. Some of our horses are missing, and I have been trying
      to pick up their tracks."
    
    
      Forde, with an earnest look in his blue eyes, looked up from the fire he
      was kindling, and shook his head gravely. "You should not venture so far
      away, Miss Fraser. How can you tell but that whilst you are trying to pick
      up the horses' tracks that the blacks about Repulse Bay are not now
      engaged in picking up yours?"
    
    
      "Oh, I am not afraid of any of the myalls{*} about Whitsunday Passage and
      Repulse Bay, Mr Forde. I really believe that if I rode into one of their
      camps they would not bolt. Poor wretches! I do feel sorry for them when I
      know how they are harried and shot down       so often without cause       by
      the Native Police. Oh, I hate the Native Police! How is it, Mr Forde, that
      the Government of this colony can employ these uniformed savages to murder       I
      call it murder       their own race? Every time I see a patrol pass, I
      shudder; their fierce, insolently-evil faces, and the horrid way they show
      the whites of their eyes when they ride by with their Snider carbines by
      their sides, looking at every tame black with such a savage, supercilious
      hatred! And their white officers       oh, how can any man who pretends to
      be a gentleman, and calls himself a Christian, descend to such an
      ignominious position as to lead a party of black troopers? If I were a
      man, and had to become a sub-inspector of Native Police, I would at least
      blacken my face so as to hide my shame when I rode out with my
      fellow-murderers and cutthroats."
    

     * Wild blacks.

    
      Her eyes, filled with tears as they were, flashed with scorn as she spoke.
      The clergyman looked admiringly at her as he put his hand on her arm.
    
    
      "You must remember, Miss Fraser, that the wild blacks on this coast have
      committed some dreadful murders. How many settlers, miners, and swagmen
      have been ruthlessly slaughtered?"
    
    
      "And how many hundreds of these unfortunate savages have been ruthlessly
      slaughtered, not only by the Black Police, but by squatters and stockmen,
      who deny the poor wretches the right to exist? We have taken away their
      hunting grounds! We shoot them down as vermin, because, impelled by the
      hunger that we have brought upon them, they occasionally spear a bullock
      or horse or two! Why cannot the Government do as my father suggests       reserve
      a long strip of country for these poor savages, just a small piece of
      God's earth that shall be inviolate from the greedy squatter, the miner,
      the sugar planter? And let the wretched beings at least live and die a
      natural death."
    
    
      The clergyman's face flushed as he listened to her passionate words. "It
      is, I believe, impossible to segregate the coastal tribes of the
      Australian mainland. The cost of such an attempt would, in the first
      place, be enormous; in the second, the people of the colony              "
    
    
      "The people, Mr Forde! You mean the squatters, the sugar-planters, the
      land-devouring swarm of 'Christians,' who think that a bullock's hide,
      worth twenty shillings, is of more moment than the welfare of thousands of
      poor, naked savages, whose country we have taken, and yet of whom we make
      beasts of burden       hewers of wood and drawers of water. Oh, if I were
      only a man!"
    
    
      "But you are, instead, a beautiful girl, Miss Fraser."
    
    
      "Don't pay me any compliments, Mr Forde, or I shall begin to dislike you,
      and work you a pair of woollen slippers like English girls do in novels
      for the pale-faced, ascetic young curates, with their thin hands, and the
      dark, melancholy eyes."
    
    
      Forde laughed heartily this time, and held out his own hands jestingly for
      her inspection; they were as brawny and sunburned as those of any stockman
      or working miner, and were in keeping with his costume, which was
      decidedly unclerical. For he only wore his clerical "rig" when visiting
      towns sufficiently populous for him to hold services therein. At the
      present time he was clad in the usual Crimean shirt, white moleskins, and
      brown leather leggings, and the grey slouched felt hat affected by most
      bushmen. His valise, however, contained all that was necessary       even
      to the wreck of a clerical hat       to turn himself into the orthodox
      travelling clergyman of the Australian bush.
    
    
      "Ah! I was only joking, Mr Forde, as you know. You are not the
      usual kind of 'parson.' That is why father       and everyone else       likes
      you. Then, too, you can ride       I mean sit a horse as an Australian
      does; and you smoke a pipe, and       oh, I wonder, Mr Forde, that you
      never married! Now I am sure that Mrs Tallis admires you       In fact she
      told me so, and Kaburie is a lovely station, and              "
    
    
      The clergyman laughed again. "Thank you, Miss Fraser. I'm afraid I should
      not have courage enough to propose to a brand-new widow even if I was sure
      she would say 'yes.'" Then he added quietly, "There is only one woman in
      the world for me; and I have not even dared let her know I care for her. I
      want her to get to know me a little better. And then a bush parson is not
      a very eligible parti?
    
    
      "Oh! I don't see why not, though I don't think I should like to
      marry a clergyman."
    
    
      "Why?" He asked the question with such sudden earnestness that she looked
      up.
    
    
      "Oh! one would have to visit such a lot of disagreeable women, and be at
      least civil to them. Take old Mrs Piper for instance. She gave fifty
      pounds towards the little church built at Boorala, and made your
      predecessor's life miserable for the two years he was in the district. She
      told him that she strongly disapproved of single clergymen 'under any
      circumstances,' and tried to make the unfortunate man propose to Miss
      Guggin, who is forty if she's a day, and poor Mr Simpson was only
      twenty-five."
    
    
      "No wonder he fled the country."
    
    
      "No wonder, indeed! Then there are the Treverton family at Boorala; very
      rich and highly respectable, though old Treverton was a notorious cattle
      duffer{*} in Victoria. Father says that Mr Treverton would have made the
      patriarch Jacob die with envy. He started from Gippsland with a team of
      working bullocks, six horses, and twenty-four cows and calves to take up
      new country on the Campaspe River, and, in six months' journey overland,
      his herd of cattle had increased to a thousand head       most of them
      full-grown, and by some mysterious agency they were branded 'T' as well!
      And the six horses had multiplied to an astonishing extent; from six they
      had grown to fifty, all in six months! And now Joseph Treverton, Esq.,
      J.P., and Member of the Legislative Assembly, is one of the richest
      squatters in the North, and the Misses Treverton speak of their 'papa' as
      'one of the very earliest pioneers of the pastoral industry in North
      Queensland, you know.'"
    

     * Cattle stealer.

    
      The girl's frank sarcasm delighted Forde, the more so as he knew that what
      she had said was perfectly true.
    
    
      "Well, it is a new country, you see, Miss Fraser, and              "
    
    
      Just then the two horses raised their heads and neighed, and Forde, going
      to the edge of the bluff, saw a horseman coming along the beach in a
      direct line for where they were camped.
    
    
      "We are to have company, Miss Fraser. There is some one riding direct for
      the bluff."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IX
    
    
      In less than half-an-hour the new-comer, who was walking his horse, slowly
      rode up to the bluff, and raised his hat to Miss Fraser and her companion.
    
    
      "Good-morning!" he said, as he dismounted. "I saw you as I was coming
      along the beach and so turned off. Am I on the right track for Kaburie,
      and Fraser's Gully?"
    
    
      "Yes," replied Forde, "this is the turn off here for both Kaburie and the
      Gully; the main track goes on to Boorala. Will you have some tea?"
    
    
      "Thank you, I shall be very glad of a drink." Then again raising his hat
      to Kate, he said, "My name is Gerrard. Are you Miss Fraser?"
    
    
      "Yes," replied Kate smiling, "and you are Mr Gerrard of Ocho Rios, I am
      sure, for I have seen your photograph. But how did you guess I was Kate
      Fraser?"
    
    
      "I really could not tell you; but somehow I felt certain that you were the
      young lady whom Mr Lacey described so admiringly to me a day or two ago."
    
    
      "Did he? The dear old man! How nice of him," and she laughed merrily. "Mr
      Gerrard, this is my friend, the Reverend Mr Forde, of Boorala       and
      hundreds of other towns as well."
    
    
      The two men shook hands, and in a few minutes Gerrard was conversing with
      him and his fair companion as if he had known them for years, and both
      Forde and Kate were much interested in learning the object of his visit to
      Kaburie.
    
    
      "I do hope you will buy Kaburie, Mr Gerrard," said Kate; "it is a really
      splendid station, and I am sure that you will like it better than your
      place away up on Yorke's Peninsula. Of course," she added, with her usual
      serene frankness, "I am very, very sorry that Mrs Tallis is not coming
      back, for we are great friends, and always exchanged visits once a week,
      and now I shall miss going there very much. And, oh, the garden of which
      she was so proud! I suppose now              " she stopped, and reddened
      slightly.
    
    
      "Go on, please," said Gerrard with assumed gravity, though his eyes were
      smiling.
    
    
      "I was about to be rude enough to say that most men don't care much for
      flowers."
    
    
      "If I buy Kaburie, Miss Fraser, I will come to you, cap in hand, and
      humbly beg you to instruct me what to do; and furthermore, I promise that
      when you say 'do this' it shall be done."
    
    
      "You are undertaking a big contract, Mr Gerrard," said Forde with a laugh,
      as he rose to go to his horse; "you will have to send to Sydney for a
      Scotch gardener."
    
    
      As soon as the clergyman was out of hearing Gerrard, who had remembered
      Lacey's remark about "a parson being in the running," said quietly, "I
      certainly am a most forgetful man, Miss Fraser, and ask your forgiveness.
      Here is a letter for you, which my friend Aulain asked me to deliver to
      you."
    
    
      The girl blushed deeply as she took the letter, for she instinctively
      divined that Gerrard had purposely deferred giving her the letter whilst
      Forde was with them. And from that moment she liked him.
    
    
      "Thank you, Mr Gerrard," she said, as she placed the letter in the pocket
      of her skirt. "Is Mr Aulain any better?"
    
    
      "Yes, but he won't be 'fit' for another six weeks or so. He has had a very
      bad attack of fever this time. Of course you know that he and I are old
      friends?"
    
    
      "Oh, yes, indeed! He always writes and speaks of you as 'old
      Tom-and-Jerry.' And I am so really, really glad to meet you, Mr Gerrard.
      Randolph says that you are the finest scrub rider in Australia, and he is
      next."
    
    
      "Ah, no, he is the first, as I told Lacey a couple of days ago. His own
      troopers can hardly follow him when              "
    
    
      "Don't, Mr Gerrard! I know what you were about to say," and she shuddered;
      "but please do not ever speak to me of Mr Aulain in connection with the
      Native Police. I loathe and detest them, and would rather he were a
      working miner or a stockman, than a leader of such fiends."
    
    
      "Randolph Aulain is a different stamp of a man from the usual Inspector,
      Miss Fraser. No one has ever accused him of cruelty or unnecessary
      severity in discharging his duties."
    
    
      "It is an ignominious duty, I think, to shoot and harass the blacks in the
      manner the police do," persisted Kate. "When the brig Maria was
      lost here on the coast some years ago, and some of the crew killed by the
      blacks, the Government acted most cruelly. The Native Police not only shot
      the actual murderers, but ruthlessly wiped out whole camps of tribes that
      were hundreds of miles away from where the vessel was lost."
    
    
      Gerrard nodded. "So I heard. But I can assure you, Miss Fraser, that the
      Native Police under men like Aulain, can, and do, good service. The blacks
      in this part of the colony are bad enough, but on Cape York Peninsula,
      they are worse       daring and ferocious cannibals. The instinct to slay
      all strangers is inborn with them. Some of the tribes on the Batavia River
      district I believe to be absolutely untamable."
    
    
      "Would you shoot a black-fellow, Mr Gerrard, for spearing a horse
      or bullock?"
    
    
      "No, certainly not! But you see, Miss Fraser, we squatters would not mind
      them killing a beast or two for food occasionally, but they will spear
      perhaps thirty or forty, and so terrify a large mob of cattle that they
      will seek refuge in the ranges, and eventually become so wild as to be
      irrecoverable. I can put down my losses alone from this cause at over a
      thousand head. Then, again, two of my stockmen were killed and eaten three
      years ago; and this necessitated inflicting a very severe punishment."
    
    
      The girl sighed, but said no more on the subject.
    
    
      "You will stay with us to-night, will you not, Mr Gerrard?" she said as
      Forde returned. "It will be so pleasant for father and me to have both Mr
      Forde and you with us for the night."
    
    
      "Thank you, I will, with pleasure. Perhaps your father       and you too       will
      come on to, Kaburie with me in the morning, show me the ropes, and tell me
      something about the country. And then you can see how the garden looks as
      well."
    
    
      Kate's eyes brightened. "Indeed, we will I I love Kaburie. When we heard
      that it was to be sold, father tried to lease it from poor Mrs Tallis, but
      she wanted to sell outright, so father has to keep 'pegging away' at the
      claim, and our old rattle-trap of a crushing mill. But some day, perhaps,
      we shall 'strike it rich' as the miners say."
    
    
      The horses were again saddled, and the party set out on their way, riding
      single file along the narrow bush track towards the ranges in which the
      little mining camp was situated. The sun was well towards the west when
      they came in sight of the rough, bark-roofed shed with uncovered sides,
      which contained the battery plant, and Fraser's equally unpretentious
      dwelling, which, with three or four miners' huts constituted the camp. A
      bright, brawling little mountain stream, with high banks lined with the
      graceful whispering she-oaks, gave a pleasant and refreshing appearance to
      the scene, and the clash and rattle of the heavy stampers as they crushed
      the golden quartz, echoed and re-echoed among the rugged tree clad range.
    
    
      A big, broad-shouldered man of about sixty years of age, who was engaged
      in thrusting a log of ironbark wood into the boiler furnace, turned as he
      heard Forde's loud coo-e-e! and came towards them. He was
      bareheaded, and clad in a coarse flannel singlet, and dirty moleskin
      pants, with knee-boots; and his perspiring face was streaked with oil and
      grease from the engine. Taking a piece of cotton-waste from his belt, he
      wiped his hands leisurely as the three travellers dismounted.
    
    
      "Father," said Kate, "I couldn't find the horses. But I 'found' Mr Forde,
      and this is Mr Gerrard, who is going to Kaburie, and who has promised to
      camp here to-night."
    
    
      "Glad to see you," and the big man shook hands with Gerrard; "how are you,
      Forde? Get along up to the house, Kate, and I'll follow you soon. Give
      Forde and Mr Gerrard towels. I daresay they'll be glad of a bathe in the
      creek before supper. You know where the whisky is, parson. Help yourself
      and Mr Gerrard."
    
    
      "How is she going, father?" asked Kate.
    
    
      "Oh! just the same, about half an ounce or so."
    
    
      ("She", in miners' parlance, was the stone then being crushed       a
      crushing is always a "she." Sometimes "she" is a "bully-boy with a glass
      eye; going four ounces to the ton." Sometimes "she" is a "rank duffer."
      Sometimes "she" is "just paying and no more.")
    
    
      Simple as was the girl's question, Gerrard noted the grey shadow of
      disappointment in her dark eyes, as her father replied to it, and a quick
      sympathy for her sprung up in his heart. And to Fraser himself he had
      taken an instantaneous liking. Those big, light-grey Scotsman's eyes with
      their heavy brows of white overshadowing, and the rough, but genial voice
      reminded him of his brother-in-law Westonley.
    
    
      "I'll give the old man a lift," he said to himself, as he walked beside
      Kate to the house.
    
    
      "What are you thinking of, Mr Fraser?" asked Kate, "I really believe you
      are talking to yourself."
    
    
      "Was I?" he laughed, "it is a habit of mine that has grown on me from
      being so much alone. What a splendid type of a man your father is, Miss
      Fraser."
    
    
      The glance of delight which shone in her eyes made Tom Gerrard's heart
      quicken as it had never before to the voice of any woman.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER X
    
    
      Douglas Fraser was a widower, his wife having died when Kate was only four
      years of age. She was now nineteen, and had been her father's constant
      companion and helpmate ever since the death of her mother. Fraser, who to
      all appearance was only the ordinary type of working miner common to all
      Australasian gold-fields, was in reality a highly-educated man, who had
      been not only a successful barrister, but a judge of the District Court of
      New South Wales. The death of his wife, however, to whom he was
      passionately devoted, changed the whole course of his existence. Resigning
      his appointment, he withdrew himself absolutely from all society, sold his
      house and such other property as he possessed, and then, to the
      astonishment of his many warm friends, disappeared with his little
      daughter from Sydney altogether. A year or so later one of these friends
      came across him riding down the main street of the mining township of
      Gympie (on the Mary River in Queensland). He was in the ordinary diggers'
      costume, and the once clean-shaved, legal face was now covered with a
      rough, strong beard.
    
    
      "How are you, Favenc?" said his ex-Honour the Judge, quietly, as he pulled
      up his horse, and dismounted; "have you too, caught the gold-field fever,
      that I see you in Gympie?"
    
    
      "No! I'm here on circuit with Judge Blakeney       Crown-Prosecuting. And
      how are you, Fraser?"
    
    
      "Oh, very well! I've gone in for mining; always had a hankering that way.
      So far I have had no brilliant success, but hope to get on to something
      good in the course of time."
    
    
      For some years after this he wandered from one gold-field to another,
      always getting further northward, and always accompanied by his child, to
      whom he was able to give a good education, though not in a style that
      would have met with the approbation of the principal of a ladies' school.
      He had finally settled at Fraser's Gully, where he had discovered a large,
      but not rich reef, and for the past five years he and some half a dozen
      miners had worked it, sometimes doing very well, at others their labour
      yielding them a poor return. On the whole, however, he was making money,
      and the life suited him. Very often he would urge Kate to go to Sydney for
      a year or two, and see something of the world, under the care of her
      mother's people, but she steadfastly refused to leave him.
    
    
      "It would be simply horrible for me, father. I could not stand it for even
      a month. I am very, very happy here with you, and only wish I had more to
      do."
    
    
      "You have quite enough I think, little woman       keeping house for me,
      milking and dairy work, and making bread for seven hungry men."
    
    
      "I like it. And then I am the only woman about here now that Mrs Tallis
      has gone, and I feel more important than ever. But I do wish I were
      a man, and could help you more than I do."
    
    
      Between father and daughter there had ever been the greatest love and
      confidence, and their existence, though often monotonous, was a happy one.
      To her father's miners, "Miss Kate" was a fairy goddess, and consternation
      reigned among them when one day a passing Jewish hawker told them that it
      was rumoured that Parson Forde was "a stickin' up ter Miss Fraser, and the
      match was as good as made."
    
    
      The men had bought a couple of bottles of whisky from the hawker when this
      portentous announcement was made, and little "Cockney Smith" the youngest
      man of the party, who was just about to drink off the first grog he had
      tasted since his semi-annual spree at Boorala, set it down untouched.
    
    
      "I thought the bloomin' Holy Joe was a comin' 'ere pretty frequent," he
      said, "but didn't think he was after Miss Kate. Well, all I can say is,"       he
      raised his glass       "that suthin'll 'appin to 'im. I 'ope 'e may be
      bloomin' well drownded when 'e's crossin' a creek."
    
    
      "Shut up, Cockney," growled Sam Young, an old grey-haired miner, "it's
      only a Boorala yarn, and Boorala is as full of liars as the bottomless pit
      is full of wood and coal merchants. And it doesn't become you to call the
      parson a Holy Joe. Maybe you've forgottten that when you busted your last
      cheque at Hooley's pub in Boorala, and had the dilly trimmings, that it
      was the parson who brought you back here, you boozy little swine. Didn't
      he, boys?"
    
    
      "You bet he did," was the unanimous response.
    
    
      "And come here and give you four good nips a day outer his own flask until
      you was rid of the green dogs with red eyes, and flamin' fiery tails that
      you was screechin' about," went on Sam, relentlessly. "If she's going to
      hitch up with the parson it can't be helped. Anyways he's the right sort
      of a sky pilot; a white man all over, and can shoe a horse, and do a bit
      of bullocking{*} as well as he can preach."
    

     * Hard manual labour.

    
      "Wasn't there some talk about her and the Black Police officer being
      engaged?" said the hawker, who was a great retailer of bush gossip.
    
    
      "Wasn't there some talk of you havin' done time for trying to do the fire
      insurance people?" angrily retorted Young, who was wroth at the hawker's
      familiar way of speaking of the goddess of Fraser's Gully.
    
    
      "It vasn't me at all," protested the hawker. "It vas another Isaac
      Benjamin altogether."
    
    
      "What did he do?" asked Cockney Smith.
    
    
      "He had a store in Brisbane," said Young, "and insured the stock for about
      two thousand quid,{*} and made an awful fuss about his being so careful of
      fire. He bought about fifty of them round glass bottles full of a sort of
      stuff called fire exstinker       bottles that you can hang up on a nail
      with a bit of string, or put on shelves, or anywhere, and if a place
      catches on fire, they burst, and the exstinker liquid sends out a sort of
      gas which puts out a fire in no time. One'll do the trick.
    

     * "Quid": £1.

    
      "Well, this chap       of course it isn't your fault, Ikey, that your name
      is the same as his       was dead set on getting that two thousand quid
      for his stock, which was only worth about five hundred. But he was such a
      downy cove       did you ever come acrost him, Ikey?"
    
    
      "No, never," emphatically replied the hawker, "and he vasn't no relation
      of mine either."
    
    
      "Well, as I was saying, he was always making a fearful fuss about a fire,
      and as he was a member of the Fire Brigade Board, he was always bringing
      forward ressylutions at the Committee meetings for a better water supply,
      and all that sort of thing, and he gave a five pound note to the driver of
      the fire engine because he was a temperance man of fifteen years'
      standing, and set a noble example to the Brigade. Did you hear about that,
      Ikey?"
    
    
      "No, I didn't," answered the hawker uneasily.
    
    
      "Well, he did. He hated liquor in any shape or form, he said, and wouldn't
      sell any in his store on no account whatever, and wanted all the Fire
      Brigade men and other public servants to take the pledge. And the
      noosepapers said he was a great-hearted phillyanthropist.
    
    
      "He had two boys in the store to help him       was it two, Ikey?"
    
    
      "I don't remember, Mr Young. I vas never much interested in reading about
      rogueries of any kind."
    
    
      "Just so! Well, one Sunday night one of the boys came back to the store
      for suthin' or other, and he sees you       I mean the feller as has the
      same name       emptying out the fire liquid in the exstinkers, and
      fillin' em up with kerosene. So, being a cute young nipper, he slips away
      to the Fire Brigade station and says to the Superintendent, 'Give me ten
      bob an' I'll tell you a secret about Ikey Benjamin and his fire
      exstinkers.' The Super gave him the money, and the boy tells the yarn, and
      about two o'clock in the morning the fire bells starts ringin', and Ikey
      was aroused from a dead sleep with the noos that his store was alight in
      seventeen places, but that the firemen was puttin' it out vigorously. How
      many years did you       I mean the other cove       get, Ikey?"
    
    
      "I don't know," replied the hawker, "but I do know that I must be getting
      along to Boorala," and hurriedly gathering together his effects, he
      departed in a bad temper.
    
    
      Young gave his mates a solemn wink, and then laughed.
    
    
      "He's the chap, boys; and if he hadn't started gassin' about Miss Kate, I
      wouldn't have started on him. As for what he said about her and Mr Aulain,
      there's some truth in it. The Inspector is dead sweet on her, I know, but
      whether she cares for him is another matter. Anyway she hasn't seen him
      for nigh on two years, so I think it must be off. And you all know what
      she thinks of the Nigger Police, don't you?"
    
    
      The arrival of the Goddess of the Gully with her two companions created
      quite a little stir at the camp. As soon as Forde and Gerrard had finished
      their refreshing bathe in the crystal waters of the creek, and returned to
      the house, they found Kate had supper ready. She had changed her riding
      dress for a white skirt and blouse, and looked as Forde said, "divinely
      cool and refreshing."
    
    
      "Father will be here in a few minutes," she said, as going to a small
      overmantel she deftly re-coiled her hair, which had a way of becoming
      loose. "What a nuisance is a woman's hair, isn't it, Mr Gerrard? Now, Mr
      Forde, why don't you say it is her glory? Don't be shocked at me,
      Mr Gerrard, but the fact is I am short of hair-pins, and this morning when
      the filly began bucking, I lost nearly all I had. I think I shall do my
      hair à la Suisse."
    
    
      "I wouldn't if I were you," said her father, who just then entered after a
      hasty "wash down" in a tub placed at the back of the house, "there are a
      lot of native dogs about, and you might lose it."
    
    
      Both Forde and Gerrard, and Kate as well, laughed loudly, for they all
      knew that in the winter time, when the dingoes{*} were hungry they would
      often bite off the tails of calves not old enough to kick off their
      assailants.
    

     * The Australian wild dog.

    
      Kate clenched her little sunbrowned hand, and punched her father on his
      mighty chest. "You rude man! You don't deserve any supper."
    
    
      Late in the evening, as Forde and his host were walking to and fro outside
      the house, and Kate was reading Aulain's letter in her room, Gerrard was
      stretched out upon his bed, smoking his pipe, and talking to himself.
    
    
      "I wish I had never seen you, Miss Kate Fraser. And I wish Aulain, my boy,
      that you were safely married to her. And I wish that there were two more
      like you, Miss Kate       one for me, and one for the parson. And I wish I
      was not such an idiot as to wish anything at all."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XI
    
    
      Just as dawn broke, the deep note of a bell-bird awakened Kate from a
      somewhat restless and troubled slumber; but quickly dressing, she took up
      a bucket and set off to the milking-yard.
    
    
      The ground and the branches of the trees above were heavily laden with the
      night-dew, and in a few minutes her feet were wet through, and then, ere
      she had walked half the distance to the yard, several long-legged, gaunt
      kangaroo dogs, who were watching for their mistress, made a silent and
      sudden rush to welcome her, leaping up and muddying her shoulders with
      their wet paws, and making determined efforts to lick her hair and face.
    
    
      Presently a loud whistle sounded from somewhere near, and "Cockney Smith"
      appeared driving before him two cows, and in an instant the dogs darted
      off to him, and let the girl enter the yard in peace.
    
    
      "Why, Miss Kate, them 'ere dorgs will bite the 'ed off'n you if you don't
      use a whip on 'em when they get prancin' around like that," and he lashed
      out at them with the whip he carried.
    
    
      Kate laughed. "Poor doggies! they badly want a day's kangarooing, so I
      must not mind their roughness. I think, Smith, if we can only find the
      missing horses this week we'll have at least half-a-day's run with the
      dogs on Sunday. To-day I am going with my father to Kaburie."
    
    
      "Right you are, Miss!" said the young miner, who, like his mates, revelled
      in a kangaroo hunt. "On'y yesterday near the claim, I seed an old man
      kangaroo as big as a house, but er course, bekos I was on foot, and hadn't
      got no dorgs with me, 'e took no more notice of me than if I was a
      bloomin' howl. 'E just stood up on 'is 'ind legs, and looked at me for
      about five minutes with a whisp o' grass hangin' outer 'is mouth; then 'e
      goes on feedin' has if 'e didn't mind dorgs or 'orses, or men, and hadn't
      never heerd o' kangaroo-tail soup in 'is life."
    
    
      "Perhaps we may get him next Sunday, Smith. Now, bail up, Maggie, and if
      you try to kick over the bucket you'll feel sorry, I can assure you," and
      she smacked a jet black little cow on the ribs with her strong, shapely
      brown hand. The beast put her head through the bail; "Cockney" quickly
      pinned her in, then secured her "kicking" leg with a green hide leg rope,
      and the Goddess of the Gully began to milk. "Cockney" stood by watching,
      pipe in mouth, and waiting till Kate was ready for the second cow to be
      put in the bail.
    
    
      "Here's Jackey and 'is missus, as usual, Miss Kate," he said, pointing to
      the slip rails of the milking yard, on which a large "laughing jackass,"
      and his mate had perched, and were regarding Kate with solemn attention.
    
    
      "Oh, the poor things! I forgot their bread this morning. I was thinking
      about something else."
    
    
      "Don't you worry about 'em, Miss," said Smith, with a grin, "they can take
      care 'o themselves, Miss Kate."
    
    
      "Yes, Smith."
    
    
      "I went to look at that 'ere guinea hen what was sittin' on eleven eggs
      under that sort o' cotton bush in the 'orse paddock."
    
    
      "Did you? The chicks will be out in three or four days."
    
    
      "They are out already, Miss; them two laughin' jackasses 'as heaten up
      every blessed egg, and on'y the shells is lef. I thought I saw 'em flying
      about the nest, and went to see."
    
    
      "Oh, the wretches!" cried Kate in dismay.
    
    
      "Next ter halligaters, laughin' jackasses his the mischievioustest, and
      cunnin'est things hin creation," observed Mr Smith; "hif I 'ad my gun 'ere
      now I could take 'em both hin a line. Look at 'em setting there like two
      bloomin' cheerybims, who 'adn't never seen a hegg o' any kind but their
      own."
    
    
      "Oh, no, don't shoot them, Smith. I feel very mad with them, but wouldn't
      hurt them for the world. They kill and eat such a lot of snakes       bad
      snakes, 'bandy-bandies' and 'black necks.'"
    
    
      "So I believe, Miss. And perhaps that is wot fills 'em with such
      willianly; they himbibes the snakes' cunning after they 'as digested 'em.
      I onct heerd a naturalist cove as was getting birds on the Diamantina
      River say that he was dead certain there wasn't no laughin' jackasses in
      the Garden o' Eding, which was a smokin' great pity."
    
    
      "Why?" asked Kate, as she rose, put the milk bucket aside, and let Smith
      bail up the second cow.
    
    
      "Oh, he says, says he, as he was skinnin' a jackass which had a two foot
      whip snake inside him, 'if one o' you fellers 'ad a been in Eding, poor
      Heve wouldn't 'ave got hinter no trouble, hand we 'uman bein's 'ud go on
      livin' for hever like Muthusalum. The old serpant,' says he, 'wouldn't a
      'ad the ghost of a show hif han Australlyian laughin' jackass 'ad copped
      him talkin' to Heve, and tellin' 'er it was orlright, and to go ahead an'
      heat as much as her stomach would accomydate.'"
    
    
      "Oh, I see!" said Kate gravely, "I must tell that to Mr Forde."
    
    
      "'E won't mind       'ell on'y larf," said Mr Smith, who was a talkative
      young man for an Australian bushman, native to the soil. (The nickname of
      "Cockney" had been bestowed upon him on account of his father being a
      Londoner, who, like a true patriot, had left his country for his country's
      good.) He was a good-natured, hard-working man like the rest of the hands
      at the camp, but was the "bad boy" of the community as far as liquor was
      concerned. Every three months, when Fraser "squared up" with his miners,
      and handed them their share of the proceeds from the gold obtained, he
      gave them all a week's leave to spend in Boorala, or any other township in
      the district. Not more than two or three would elect to go, but of these
      Cockney Smith was always one. On such occasions Kate would stand at her
      father's door on the look-out       to see that Mr Smith did not ride off
      without being interviewed.
    
    
      "How much have you this time, Smith?" she would ask.
    
    
      "Forty-five quid, Miss."
    
    
      "I'll take ten."
    
    
      "Thirty-five pound don't go far in Boorala, Miss," he would plead,
      uneasily.
    
    
      "It will go far enough for you to see the Police Magistrate, and be fined
      five pounds, or take fourteen days for disorderly conduct, and also enable
      you to pay that wicked wretch of a Hooley for the poisonous stuff he gives
      you to drink, and keep him from taking your horse and saddle. In fact I
      think you might go with thirty pounds this time."
    
    
      "Oh, 'Eavens, Miss!" and Cockney's features would display horrified
      astonishment as he hurriedly handed her ten one-pound notes. "Why it's the
      winter meetin' of the Boorala Jockey Club, and I'll want an extra ten quid
      to put on a couple o' 'orses; one is a bay colt that won              "
    
    
      "That will do, Smith. You are a bad lot. You tell me horrible stories.
      Instead of going sober to the race-course, you go drunk, and are robbed,
      or lose your money, or fight the police, and              "
    
    
      "Didn't I pull it orf, larst Christmas, Miss, with Banjo in the 'urdle
      race? Didn't I collar a hundred and five quid from that Melbourne bookie?"
    
    
      "Yes. And what became of it? How much of it did you bring back? Just
      thirty shillings! And you couldn't do any work for nearly two weeks; and
      you had delirium tremens. Now, go away, and if you come back as you
      did last time father won't have any more to do with you       and neither
      will I."
    
    
      Smith would ride off with his companions. "She made me ante up ten quid
      this time," he would observe       expecting sympathy.
    
    
      "Well, it's ten pound to the good for you, you boozing little owl," would
      be the reply. For all the men at the camp knew that during two years Kate
      had placed various sums to the credit of Smith at the Boorala bank, and
      had extorted a solemn promise from him not to attempt to write a cheque
      for even one pound without her consent. But, as she felt she could not
      trust Cockney, she had also taken the bank manager into her confidence,
      and asked him to refuse to honour any cheque drawn by "the bad lot" unless
      it had her endorsement.
    
    
      The bank manager, who was another of Kate's adorers, promised to observe
      her wishes. "It's not banking etiquette, Miss Fraser, but that doesn't
      matter in North Queensland. We do many things that we ought not to do, and
      if Smith draws a cheque you may be sure that I will refuse to pay it as
      'signature illegible'       as it is sure to be. But I'll lend him a few
      pounds if he breaks out again, and is laid up in this abode of sin, so
      that he may get home again to your protecting care."
    
    
      The milking was finished, and Smith, taking up the heavy bucket of milk,
      was just about to carry it to the house, when he set it down again.
    
    
      "My word, Miss," he said admiringly, "look there; there's that Mr Gerrard
      a-gallopin' 'is 'orse down to the creek for a swim bareback. My oath, 'e
      can ride."
    
    
      Kate turned just in time, and saw Gerrard, who was in his pyjamas with a
      towel over his shoulders, disappearing over the ridge at a full gallop.
      She did not know that he had risen long before she had, walked in the grey
      dawn to the horse paddock through the dew-soaked grass, caught his horse,
      and had been an interested spectator of her dairy work.
    
    
      "Yes, Smith, he can ride, as you say. And his horse wanted a swim
      after such a hot ride from Port Denison."
    
    
      As they walked back to the house, Kate saw her father coming towards them,
      and let Smith go on.
    
    
      "Father," she said, "I am glad to see you before breakfast as I shall not
      perhaps have a chance to speak to you if we are going to Kaburie to-day
      with Mr Gerrard."
    
    
      "What is it?"
    
    
      "Mr Aulain has written to me. He wants me to marry him."
    
    
      "So does Forde, who asked me for you last night."
    
    
      Kate laughed.
    
    
      "We'll talk about it by and by, my girl," said Fraser gravely, as he
      stroked her head.
    
    
      "There will not be much to talk about, father," was the decisive answer.
      "I am never, never going to leave you for any man       no matter who he
      is."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XII
    
    
      Fraser, his daughter and their two guests were on the road to Kaburie, and
      within a few miles of the turn-off to Boorala. Kate and the clergymen were
      together, her father and Gerrard some hundreds of yards in advance, and
      all were walking their horses slowly, for the sun was beating fiercely
      down upon them through the scantily-foliaged gum trees, and Kaburie was
      yet twenty miles away. The girl sat in her saddle with bent head, and
      there were traces of tears on her cheeks.
    
    
      "I am very, very sorry, Mr Forde, for I do like you very, very much       more
      than any other man in the world except my father. You have always been so
      kind to him and to me; but I never thought that you would ask me to be
      your wife. And it hurts me to              "
    
    
      Forde placed his hand on hers. "Never mind, Kate. It was a foolish dream
      of mine, that is all. But you were always the one woman in the world to me
      ever since I first met you two years ago. And it grieves me that I should
      have made you shed one single tear."
    
    
      His calm, steady voice, and the firm pressure of his hand reassured her.
      Her father had said to her a few hours before that Forde would take her
      refusal "like a man," and she had replied that she knew it.
    
    
      She raised her face to his as he bent towards her, and, on the impulse of
      a moment, born of her sincere liking for the man, kissed him. His bronzed
      features flushed deeply, and his whole frame thrilled as their lips met;
      and then he exercised a mighty restraint upon himself.
    
    
      "Good-bye, little woman, and God bless you," he said softly, as he bent
      over her.
    
    
      "But why are you going away, Mr Forde? Father will be so distressed, and
      so indeed will be everybody       for hundreds of miles about."
    
    
      Forde had drawn himself together again, and swinging his right foot out of
      the stirrup sat "side-saddle" and lit his pipe.
    
    
      "Well, you see, Kate, my mother has left me two thousand pounds or so. It
      was that that gave me pluck enough to speak to your father last night. I
      thought I would go to him first. Perhaps I made a mistake?"
    
    
      "No, indeed! He told me all that you said to him, and       oh! Mr Forde,
      we shall all miss you so much," and as she spoke her eyes filled with
      tears again. He looked at the gum tree branches overhead, and went on
      meditatively, apparently not taking heed of her emotion, though his heart
      was filled with love for the girl, who with bent head, rode by his side.
    
    
      "And I shall miss much       much out of my life when I leave this part of
      the colony, Kate. But I was never intended to be a clergyman. I was driven
      into the Church by my mother       good, pious soul       who, because my
      father was in the Church, condemned me to it, instead of letting me follow
      my own bent       which was either the Army or Navy or Commerce."
    
    
      "But you made a good clergyman," said the girl artlessly.
    
    
      He shook his head. "Well, the fact is, Kate, that I was always pretty sick
      of it, although I must say that I like the free open life of the bush, and
      the people; especially the working men, diggers, and stockmen. And their
      frank hospitality and rough good nature I can never forget."
    
    
      "Where do you think of going?"
    
    
      "To Sydney first Then I'll decide what to do. I am very much inclined to
      follow your father's example and go in for mining; either that or
      cattle-breeding. But, of course, I shall write and let you know."
    
    
      "Do!" she said, earnestly, and then they quickened their horses' pace, as
      they saw that Fraser and Gerrard had pulled up at the turn-off to Boorala,
      and were awaiting them.
    
    
      "Well, Forde, old man," said the mine-owner, as he bade the clergyman
      good-bye, "you will leave a big hole in the hearts of the people about
      here. Kate and I especially will miss you. And I do hope that we shall
      meet again."
    
    
      "Nothing is more likely. I like Queensland too much to leave it
      altogether," and then with another warm grasp of the hand, he said
      good-bye to them all, and turned along the Boorala track.
    
    
      "One of the whitest men that ever put foot in stirrup," said Fraser a few
      minutes later to Gerrard.
    
    
      "I'm sure of it!" assented Gerrard. And then they began to speak of
      Kaburie, Fraser giving his visitor every possible information about the
      country and its cattle-carrying capabilities. It was, he said, one of the
      best-watered runs in the north, and a drought had never been known.
    
    
      "See!" he said, pointing to a sandal-wood scrub, "that is one of the
      mustering camps on the Kaburie boundary, and there are some of Mrs
      Tallis's cattle down there in the creek. Crack your whip, Kate."
    
    
      Uncoiling the long stock-whip, the girl cracked it once only, but loudly,
      and in a few seconds hundreds of cattle appeared from the creek, and
      through the fringe of she-oaks that lined its banks; they clambered up the
      steep side and stared at the disturbers, and then at a second loud crack
      of the whip, trotted off quietly to the camp       bullocks, steers, cows
      and calves, the latter performing the usual calf antics, curving their
      bodies, hoisting their tails, and kicking their heels in the air. Once
      under the cool, grateful shade of the dark green foliage of the
      sandalwoods, they quietly awaited to be inspected, and Fraser and Gerrard
      slowly walked their horses about among them. .
    
    
      "What do you think of them?" asked the mine-owner, who was himself a good
      judge of cattle.
    
    
      "Very fair lot indeed, and all as fat as pigs," replied the squatter,
      scanning them closely. "Now then, Bully boy, what are you staring at?" he
      said to a sturdy twelve months' old bull calf, who had advanced to him.
      "Ah! you want to be branded, do you? Quite so! Well, I think it very
      likely you soon will be."
    
    
      "There has been no branding at Kaburie for six months, Mr Gerrard," said
      Kate, who added that there were now only Mrs Tallis's overseer, and one
      black boy stockman on the station, who did nothing more than muster the
      cattle occasionally on the various camps.
    
    
      Gerrard nodded. "Ladies are bad business people as a rule. There will be a
      terrible amount of branding to be done now."
    
    
      Kate, unaware of the twinkle in Gerrard's eyes, was indignant. "Indeed,
      Mrs Tallis was considered a very good business woman, and knew how to
      manage things as well as Mr Tallis. What are you laughing at, Mr Gerrard?"
    
    
      "At Mrs Tallis's smartness. She has saved herself some hundreds of pounds
      by dismissing her stockmen, and leaving the calves un-branded. All the
      work and expense will fall on whoever buys the station."
    
    
      "Oh, I see!" and Kate smiled. "But, after all, I suppose              "
    
    
      "That all is fair in love and war. And buying a cattle or sheep station is
      war in a sense between seller and buyer. I should have done the same thing
      myself, I suppose."
    
    
      "I don't believe you would," said the girl frankly. "Mr Aulain told father
      and me that you were very Quixotic."
    
    
      "Aulain doesn't know what a hard nail I am in money matters sometimes,
      Miss Fraser. I'm a perfect Shylock, and will have my pound o' flesh       especially
      bullock flesh."
    
    
      "I know better, and so do you, father, don't you," and her eyes smiled
      into Gerrard's. "Mr Aulain told us all about your selling a hundred
      bullocks to the French authorities at New Caledonia, and then, because
      half of them died on the stormy voyage to Noumea, you returned half the
      money. Was it your fault that the steamer was nearly wrecked, and the
      cattle died?"
    
    
      "Aulain did not think that it might have only been a matter of my setting
      a sprat to catch a mackerel. You see I was anxious to establish a big
      cattle trade with the French people."
    
    
      Kate shook her head decisively, but there was an expressive look in her
      eyes that gave Gerrard great content.
    
    
      Towards the afternoon the travellers saw a horseman coming towards them,
      and Kate recognised him as Tom Knowles, the overseer of Kaburie, for whom
      Gerrard had a letter from Mrs Tallis. He was a lithe, wiry little man of
      fifty, and Kate and her father exchanged smiles as, when he drew near,
      they saw that he was arrayed in his best riding "togs," was riding his
      best horse, and that his long grey moustache was carefully waxed. He had
      long been one of Kate's most ardent admirers, and had a strong belief that
      he was "well placed in the running with Aulain and the parson" for the
      young lady's affections       and hand.
    
    
      "Well, this is a pleasure," he cried, as he rode up and shook hands with
      Fraser and his daughter; "I was coming over to Gully to spend an hour or
      two with you, Fraser, but, of course, you are coming to me?"
    
    
      "Yes!" said the mineowner. "This is Mr Gerrard, Knowles. He has come to
      see you on business, and we came with him."
    
    
      The overseer, who had at first looked at Gerrard's handsome face with some
      disapproval, at once became at ease, and in a few minutes, after Gerrard
      had explained the object of his visit, the party put their horses into a
      smart canter, and half-an-hour later came to a wide, sandy-bottomed creek,
      fringed with huge ti-trees. On one of these, which was on the margin of
      the crossing, was nailed a large black painted board with an ominous
      inscription in white.
    
    
      "LOOK OUT FOR ALLIGATORS."
    
    
      "Mr Tallis had it put up," explained the overseer to Gerrard; "as two men
      were collared by 'gaters here. But when the water is clear, and the creek
      low, as it is now, there is no danger. It is when the creek is high after
      rain, and the water muddy, that the crossing is risky. I suppose you have
      any amount of the brutes up your way?"
    
    
      "Thousands! The rivers, creeks, and swamps are full of them, and I have
      lost a lot of cattle and horses at Ocho Rios by them."
    
    
      An hour later they arrived at Kaburie, and Kate was, at the request of the
      admiring Knowles, acting as hostess and preparing supper.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIII
    
    
      Two days had passed, and Gerrard was still at Kaburie, though Kate and her
      father had left the previous day; they were, however, to return, bringing
      with them three or four stockmen to assist Knowles and Gerrard to muster
      the cattle, for he had decided to buy the station and leave Knowles there
      as his manager. Although there were but four thousand head of cattle on
      the run, they were widely separated in small mobs of a few hundreds each       some
      high up in the ranges, and some haunting the low-lying littoral, and
      frequenting the flat marshy land about the mouths of the numerous creeks
      debouching into the sea, where they eagerly ate the lush, saline grasses
      and creepers that lined the coast above high-water mark       and to
      "round up" all these scattered mobs on their various camps, and count
      every beast, meant very hard work. Then too, Gerrard intended to have a
      general branding at the same time, and he felt a thrill of pleasure in his
      veins, when Kate had said to her father: "Father, why cannot we help, too?
      You can safely leave the battery and claim to Sam Young for a few days.
      And as you and I know the country so well, I am sure we should be of some
      use to Mr Gerrard."
    
    
      Douglas Fraser had never said "No" in his life to any request of Kate's
      since she was fifteen, and he smiled assent. And then in addition to that
      he had taken such a strong liking to Gerrard that it gave him pleasure to
      afford him all the assistance in his power.
    
    
      "All right, Gerrard!" (men in the Australian bush do not "Mister" each
      other after a few hour's acquaintance) "we shall be here. And I'll send
      over to Boorala for three or four good men to help in the mustering."
    
    
      So Kate and her father had ridden away and left Gerrard and Knowles to
      themselves for a few days; and Gerrard and the dapper little overseer
      planned all sorts of improvements that were to be effected in the way of
      making Kaburie a crack breeding station.
    
    
      As father and daughter rode side by side along the track back to their
      home, through the darkening shadows of the coming night, they talked about
      Forde and Aulain, Fraser resting his big brown hand on her knee, and
      looking wistfully into her face.
    
    
      "And you see, my child, that I well know that there will come a time when
      you and I must part Some man              "
    
    
      "Never, father, never! I liked Mr Forde very much, but not well enough to
      marry him, and part from you. And I kissed him, dad, when we said
      good-bye. Do you mind much? I couldn't help it. I felt that I must
      kiss him." (Then tears.) "I thought I had better tell you, for I feel so
      horribly ashamed of myself."
    
    
      "There is nothing for you to be ashamed of, child," said her father
      tenderly; "Forde is a man, and, as I told you, he would take your
      refusal like a white man and a gentleman."
    
    
      "He did. And I could not help crying over it."
    
    
      For some minutes they rode on in silence, then Fraser said:
    
    
      "When is Aulain coming?"
    
    
      "As soon as he is able to sit a horse, he said," and then her face
      flushed. "I wish he would not come, father, and yet I do not like the idea
      of writing to him and telling him so       especially when he is ill."
    
    
      Fraser nodded. "I understand. Still I think it would be the better course
      to take. I had imagined, however, Kate, that you thought more of Aulain
      than you cared to admit, even to me."
    
    
      "So I did; and so I do now, but I would never marry him, father, no matter
      how much I cared for him."
    
    
      Her father looked at her inquiringly.
    
    
      "I think I am afraid of him, dad, sometimes. He is so dreadfully jealous,
      and he has no right whatever to be jealous of me, for we were never
      engaged. And then there is another thing that is an absolute bar to my
      marrying him, though I fear I am too much of a coward to tell him so; he
      is a Roman Catholic. And whenever I think of that I remember the awful
      tragedy of the Wallington family."
    
    
      "I think you are quite right, Kate," said the mine-owner gravely.
      "Frankly, whilst I think Aulain is a fine fellow, and would make you a
      good husband, I must confess that the thought of your marrying a Roman
      Catholic has often filled me with uneasiness."
    
    
      "Don't be afraid, dad," she said decisively. "In the first place, I am not
      going to marry anyone, and shall grow into a pretty old maid; in the
      second, if I was dying of love, nothing in the world would induce me to
      marry a Roman Catholic. Whenever I think of poor Mr Wallington as we saw
      him lying on the grass with the bullet hole through his forehead, I
      shudder. I loathe the very name of Mrs Wallington, and consider her and
      Father Corregio the actual murderers of that good old man."
    
    
      She spoke of an incident that had occurred when she was sixteen.
      Wallington, a wealthy Brisbane solicitor, had gone to England on a six
      months' visit When he returned, he found that his wife and only daughter,
      a girl of five and twenty, had fallen under the influence of a Father
      Corregio, and had entered the Roman Catholic Church, and his long and
      happy married life was at an end. A week later he shot himself in his
      garden.
    
    
      "I am afraid that poor Aulain will cut up pretty roughly over this, Kate,"
      said her father presently.
    
    
      "I can't help it, father. And I think, after all, I had better write to
      him to-morrow. I really do not want him to come to the Gully."
    
    
      And she did write, and Aulain's face was not pleasant to see as he read
      her letter.
    
    
      "By ______! if it is the parson fellow, I'll shoot him like a rat," he
      said, and then he cursed the fever that kept him away from Kate.
    
    
      He went over to the Clarion office and saw Lacey, who was quick to
      perceive that something had occurred to upset the dark-faced
      sub-Inspector.
    
    
      "How are you, Aulain? Any 'shakes' to-day?" he asked, referring to the
      recurring attacks of ague from which Aulain suffered.
    
    
      "Oh! just the usual thing," replied his visitor irritably, as he sat down
      on a cane lounge, and viciously tugged at his moustache. "I thought I
      would come over and worry you with my company for a while, and get you to
      come across to the Queen's and share a bottle of fizz with me. They have
      some ice there I hear       came up by the Sydney steamer last night."
    
    
      Lacey's eyes twinkled, "I'm with you, my boy. I've just finished writing a
      particularly venomous leader upon mine adversary the Planters' Friend,
      and a nice cool drink, such as you suggest, on a roasting day like this,
      will tend to assuage the journalistic rage against my vile and hated
      contemporary."
    
    
      Arriving at the Queen's Hotel the two men went upstairs and sat down on
      comfortable cane lounges on the verandah, and in a few minutes the smiling
      Milly appeared with a large bottle of champagne, and a big lump of the
      treasured ice, carefully wrapped up in a piece of blanketing. As Lacey
      attended to the ice, Aulain began to cut the cork string.
    
    
      "Oh! by the way, Lacey," he said carelessly, "I saw in the Clarion
      yesterday that Forde, the sky pilot, is leaving the Church. Are you ready
      with the glasses."
    
    
      "I am. Faith, doesn't it look lovely. Steady, me boy, these long sleever
      glasses hold a pint. Here's long life to ye, Aulain. Heavens! but it is
      good," and he sighed contentedly as he set down his glass again.
    
    
      "Ye were asking about Forde?" he said as he wiped his red, perspiring
      face. "Yes, he is giving up parsonifying. I had a letter from him by the
      mailman yesterday from Fraser's Gully. He was staying there for the night
      with our friend Gerrard."
    
    
      Aulain's black brows knit, and his hand clenched under the table, as Lacey
      went on,
    
    
      "His mother has died, and left him some money. And very glad it is I am to
      hear it, for a finer man I don't know."
    
    
      "Much?"
    
    
      "He didn't say; but I know that his mother was pretty well off. He merely
      wrote me asking me to mention in the Clarion that he was leaving
      the Church, and was going South. Ye see, he has a power of friends all
      over the country, and he just asked me to write a bit of a paragraph
      saying he was going away, and regretted that he could not come to Port
      Denison to preach next Sunday fortnight."
    
    
      Aulain re-filled Lacey's and his own glass, "Lucky fellow! When is he
      leaving Fraser's place?"
    
    
      "He was leaving that morning for Boorala, and Fraser and his daughter and
      Gerrard were going with him as far as the turn-off. By a bit of good-luck,
      Gerrard       who also sent me a few lines       met Forde and Miss Fraser
      on his way to the Gully. Here is his note," and he took a letter from his
      pocket and handed it to Aulain, who read:
    

     "Fraser's Gully.

     "Dear Lacey,       As the Boorala mailman is calling here this
     morning, I send you a line. I had the good fortune to come
     across Miss Fraser and Mr Forde at Cape Conway, and we all
     came on to her father's place together. I like Fraser. He's
     a fine old cock. The parson, too, is a good sort As for Miss
     Kate Fraser, she is a modernised Hotspur's Kate       a
     delightfully frank and charming girl. I envy the lucky man
     who wins her. I hope the boy has not got into any mischief,
     and is giving you no trouble. Give Aulain my regards, and
     tell him I delivered his letter sooner than I anticipated. I
     leave for Kaburie this morning, and am to have the pleasure
     of being accompanied by Fraser and his daughter. Tell Jim
     that if he gets into any mischief whilst I am away, I'll
     make it hot for him.       Sincerely yours,

     "Tom Gerrard."

    
      Aulain handed the letter back to Lacey. He was outwardly calm, but his
      heart was surging with passion. What business had that d                     d
      parson fellow and Kate to be together at Cape Conway, fifteen miles away
      from her home? And then his receptive brain conjured up the blackest
      suspicions. Forde had come into money, and Kate had written to him saying
      that she could not marry him, "because she would never marry and leave her
      father." He set his teeth.
    
    
      "I think we could do another bottle, Aulain," said Lacey presently.
    
    
      "Right, old man!" replied the sub-Inspector mechanically, and then Lacey
      noticed that his bronzed face had become pallid.
    
    
      "'Shakes' coming on?" he asked, sympathetically.
    
    
      "Just a bit; but the fizz is doing me good."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIV
    
    
      Mustering on Kaburie was almost over, much to the satisfaction of every
      one taking part in it, for the weather had been unpleasantly hot even for
      North Queensland, and heavy tropical thunderstorms had added to the
      difficulty of the work by the creeks coming down in flood. All the cattle
      running in the mountain gullies and on the spurs, had been brought in, the
      calves and "clean-skins" branded, and now there remained only those which
      roamed about the coast lands.
    
    
      Early one morning Gerrard, Fraser, and Kate, with three stockmen, were
      camped near the mouth of a wide, but shallow creek, whose yellow, muddied
      waters were rushing swiftly to the sea. The party had arrived there the
      previous evening, and now, breakfast over, were ready to start to muster
      the cattle in the vicinity. Heavy rain had fallen during the night, but
      Kate's little tent, with its covering fly had kept her dry, and the rest
      of the party had slept under a rough, but efficient shelter of broad
      strips of ti-tree bark spread upon a quickly-extemporised frame of thin
      saplings.
    
    
      Just as they started the sky cleared and the blue dome above was unflecked
      by a single cloud as they rode in single file along a cattle track leading
      to the beach, which they reached in half an hour.
    
    
      "What a glorious sight!" said Gerrard, as he drew rein and pointed to the
      blue Pacific, shimmering and sparkling under the rays of the morning sun.
      "Look, there is a brig-rigged steamer quite close in       evidently she
      must be calling in at Port Denison, or would not be so near the land."
    
    
      "Yes," said Kate, "that is one of the new China mail boats, the Ching-tu.
      How beautiful she is       for a steamer, with those sloping masts, with
      the yards across, and the curved shapely bow like a sailing ship. Oh! I do
      so wish I were on board. I love ships and the If I were a man I should be
      a sailor."
    
    
      "Would you?" said Gerrard, as he looked at the animated, beautiful face.
      "I, too, am fond of the sea, though it robbed me of father, mother, and a
      brother-in-law, my twin sister's husband. She died of a broken heart soon
      after."
    
    
      Kate's eyes filled with tears. "Oh, how dreadful!" and then as they rode
      on Gerrard told her the story of the Cassowary.
    
    
      "What a sweet child your little niece Mary must be," she said, when he had
      finished, "and I am sure, too, that your protégé, Jim Coll, must be
      a perfect little man. I wish I could see him."
    
    
      "I can safely promise you that, now that I have bought Kaburie, and I feel
      pretty sure that you will gain his affections very quickly; especially if
      you will let him ride that bucking filly. I daresay that I shall be back
      here within twelve months, and bring Master Jim with me."
    
    
      "This is where we separate, boss," said a stockman named Trouton, "if you,
      Mr and Miss Fraser and me take the right bank of this creek, my two mates
      will work down on the other bank, and we'll get the cattle on both sides
      at the same time, and drive 'em all on to Wattle Camp, which is between
      this creek and the next to the south of us." Then turning to the other
      stockmen, he warned them to be careful of alligators.
    
    
      "You chaps must keep your eyes skinned if you have to swim any bits of
      backwater, now the creeks are up. Don't cross anywheres unless you have
      some cattle to send in fust, and keep clost up to their tails if yous
      can't get in among 'em. 'Gaters like man and horse meat next best to
      calf."
    
    
      The two men nodded, and riding down the bank, crossed the creek and
      quickly disappeared in the scrub on the other side; then Gerrard's party
      turned towards the coast, Trouton leading the way with the packhorses
      along a well-defined cattle-track. A quarter of an hour later they came
      across a small mob of cows and calves, which as the stockwhips cracked,
      trotted off in front, to be joined by several more, and in a short time
      the mob had increased to five hundred head, and Trouton and Gerrard
      decided to drive them across the creek to join those which were being
      rounded up by the two stockmen on the left hand bank. In reply to a
      question by Gerrard, Trouton said that the crossing was a good one even
      when the creek was as high as it was then, on account of its width       about
      two hundred yards from bank to bank.
    
    
      "It is a hard, sandy bottom, boss, and we shall only have about forty
      yards of swimming to do. If we rush 'em they'll get over in no time."
    
    
      "Very well. But we will cut out all the cows with calves too young to
      swim."
    
    
      This did not take long, and some thirty or forty cows with calves were
      separated from the mob, and driven some distance back into the scrub by
      Fraser. Then with the usual yelling and cracking of whips the main mob was
      rushed down the bank into the water, a wide-horned, stately bullock,
      plunging into the yellow stream, and taking the lead Close behind the
      cattle followed the three men and Kate, the latter and Gerrard keeping on
      the "lee" side of the mob so as to prevent them spreading out and getting
      too far down-stream, where there was danger from a number of snags of
      ti-trees, which showed above water in the middle of the creek. The cattle,
      however, kept well together, and when the deep part was reached, swam
      safely across, despite the rather strong current.
    
    
      "They went over splendidly, didn't they?" cried Fraser to Gerrard, as he
      gave his horse a loose rein and leant forward to let the animal swim
      easily. "We are lucky to get them over so easily, and              "
    
    
      His words were interrupted by a cry of terror from Kate, as the colt she
      was riding gave an agonised snort of terror, and began pawing the water
      with its fore-feet.
    
    
      "Help me, father! Mr Gerrard! Oh, it is an alligator!" and as she spoke
      she was nearly unseated. "It has Cato by the off hind leg."
    
    
      Gerrard, only ten yards away from her, turned his horse's head, and
      shouted to her to throw herself off, and then, with a deadly terror in his
      heart, saw her shaken off; and disappear in the surging stream, but in a
      few seconds she rose to the surface, panting and choking, but swimming
      bravely, though she was unable to see. Gerrard, now beside her, leant
      over, placed his left arm round her waist, and held her tight.
    
    
      "Don't be afraid," he said, "I have you safe; take a good grip of my
      horse's mane and hold on; he will take you across in a few minutes," and
      as the girl obeyed, he slipped out of the saddle, so as to swim beside
      her. Then his bronzed face went white with horror as the black snout of an
      alligator thrust itself out of the water between the girl and himself, and
      the saurian tried to seize her by the shoulder. In an instant Gerrard had
      clutched the reptile by the throat with his right hand.
    
    
      "Go on, go on; for God's sake, do not mind me!" he cried to Kate; "I have
      the brute by its throat," and then, as he and the hideous creature were
      struggling fiercely, Fraser came to his assistance, and emptied the five
      chambers of his heavy Colt's pistol into its body, and Gerrard, whose face
      was cut open by a stroke of one of the reptile's fore-paws, remembered
      nothing more till he found himself lying upon the bank with Fraser and the
      stockmen attending to him.
    
    
      "Is Miss Fraser safe?" was his first question.
    
    
      "Yes, thanks to God and to your bravery," answered Fraser with deep
      emotion; "but don't speak any more just now, there's a good fellow. The
      brute has ripped the left side of your face open from the top of your head
      to the chin, and we are trying to put in some stitches."
    
    
      "All right," was the cheerful, but faint response; "but tell me       is
      my eye gone?"
    
    
      "No, boss," said Trouton quickly, "your eye is all right, but the eyebrow
      is mauled pretty badly, and was hanging over it, but we've got it back
      again now, and tied it up in place. Here, boss, take a sup o' this," and
      he placed a brandy flask to Gerrard's lips. The liquor stung his lacerated
      lips like fire, but it revived him.
    
    
      "Where is Miss Fraser?" he then asked.
    
    
      "Here, beside you, dear Mr Gerrard," said the girl brokenly, as she
      pressed his hand, and turned her face away in blinding tears.
    
    
      "Narrow squeak for both of us, wasn't it?"
    
    
      "Yes, but please do not try to talk, dear Mr Gerrard."
    
    
      "Oh, I'm all right, and must gabble a bit, now I know that I haven't lost
      an eye. You see, Fraser, the beast, although he was only a little fellow              "
    
    
      "Eight feet he were, boss," interrupted Trouton, "but a young 'un, as you
      say."
    
    
      "Well, just after I collared him, he swung his head about and hit me such
      a tremendous smack on the side of my brain-box that it stunned me. But I
      didn't let go, did I?"
    
    
      "No," replied Fraser, "you held on like grim death. I settled the brute by
      putting five bullets into it."
    
    
      "There was two 'o 'em, boss," said Trouton, "the one as collared Miss
      Kate's horse, and the one as you tackled."
    
    
      "Did Cato get away?" Gerrard asked quickly.
    
    
      "Yes, yes, he got away," said Kate hurriedly, trying to speak calmly,
      though the poor colt, which had managed to struggle to the bank with a
      lacerated and broken leg, was then lying dead with a bullet through its
      head. Trouton had put it out of its misery.
    
    
      There was no more mustering that day, for Gerrard's condition was so
      serious, though he tried to make light of it, that Fraser, leaving the
      cattle to the care of the two stockmen, first sent off Trouton to Boorala
      for a doctor, and then he, taking one of the pack-horses, made Gerrard
      mount his own.
    
    
      "We'll be at Kaburie as soon as the little German doctor is there," he
      said, as he, Gerrard, and Kate started.
    
    
      And when they reached Kaburie they found Doctor Krause, a quiet,
      spectacled little man, awaiting them with Knowles the overseer.
    
    
      "Will he lose his eye, Krause?" asked Fraser, after the doctor had
      attended to Gerrard, and he with Kate met him in the dining-room.
    
    
      "No, but his face is very much cut about, and the poor fellow may be
      disfigured for life."
    
    
      Kate turned away with a bursting heart, and went to her room.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XV
    
    
      "Poor, dear, old Tommy boy!" said Westonley to his wife, as they sat at
      their breakfast table some weeks after the mishap to Gerrard. The mail had
      just arrived at Marumbah, and brought a letter from his brother-in-law,
      and one from Fraser, His eyes glistened as he laid them down upon the
      table, and looked at his wife, who, he could see, was also visibly
      affected, whilst little Mary sobbed unrestrainedly.
    
    
      "I wish this Mr Fraser had telegraphed to us, Edward. I would have left
      Marumbah the same day, and gone to poor Tom to nurse him."
    
    
      "Would you, old girl?" and the big man rose from his seat and kissed her,
      his thick, heavy beard spreading out over her shoulders.
    
    
      "Indeed, I would. And now it is no use my going, is it?"
    
    
      "Not a bit, Lizzie. You hear what Fraser says       'He is getting on
      splendidly, and the left eye is saved.' Let me read it all over again;
      shall I?"
    
    
      "Do," and her pale, clear-cut features flushed; "it makes me feel as if I
      were there and saw the whole dreadful sight. Don't cry any more, Mary
      dear. Uncle Tom is getting better."
    
    
      "If Jim had been with him, it wouldn't have happened," said the child,
      suppressing her sobs, and wiping her streaming eyes; "Jim would have been
      sure to have seen the alligator coming before any one else, and done
      something. I am quite sure that even if he met a bunyip he would not be
      afraid; but would fight it."
    
    
      "I'm dead certain of it, Mary," said Westonley, as he put his big hand
      upon the child's head, and then taking up Fraser's letter, he again read
      it aloud. It described in simple language Gerrard's desperate struggle
      with the alligator, then went on about his courage and fortitude under
      agonising pain, for the wounds caused by alligators' claws invariably set
      up an intense and poisonous inflammation, and take a long time to heal,
      and concluded by saying, "as long as life lasts, I shall never forget that
      only for his heroic conduct I should now be a childless man, and my
      daughter have died a death too fearful to contemplate."
    
    
      Gerrard's letter was in his usual laconic style.
    

     "Dear Ted,       I have bought a little station here called
     Kaburie       good cattle country with about 2500 head on it. In
     getting a mob across a creek I was mauled by an alligator'
     and if it had not been for my friend Fraser       in whose house
     I am now staying for a week or so       shooting the beast, it
     would have had me. It is nothing serious, so don't worry
     over me       some deep cuts on my face, that is all, and Mr
     Fraser and his daughter (a charming girl) are coddling me
     up. Jim is with me. I left him with your old friend Lacey at
     Port Denison, but the young beggar wouldn't stay when he
     heard that I had had an accident. He is making great running
     with pretty Miss Fraser. Give my love to Lizzie and Mary,
     and tell the latter that I trust her bear is now thoroughly
     convalescent Jim will write to Mary by next mail. He went
     out early this morning fishing with Miss F                     , and did
     not know that the mailman was calling to-day.       Yours ever,
     Tom."

    
      Mary's face brightened at the prospect of a letter from her dearly-beloved
      Jim, and Mrs Westonley smiled. Ever since Gerrard's visit to Marumbah
      Downs, her once icy and austere manner to the child had, bit by bit,
      relaxed, until at last she had thawed altogether, and had been amply
      repaid by such a warm response of affection that she now made a companion
      of the little one, and found herself a much happier woman now that the
      sweet sunlight of childish love had penetrated and melted her former
      frigid reserve. Westonley had noted the change with unalloyed delight,
      but, like a wise man, had pretended not to notice; but one day, soon after
      Gerrard's letter had arrived, he could not suppress himself. He had been
      away on a business visit to his squatter neighbour Brooke, to whom he had
      sold his cattle station in Central Queensland at a very satisfactory
      figure, and as he rode up to the slip-rails of the home-paddock, he saw
      the one time "incubus" coming flying towards him, her sun-tanned face
      wreathed in smiles.
    
    
      "Oh, Uncle Ted, Uncle Ted!" she panted, as she took down the slip-rails,
      and let Westonley pass through, "just fancy, Uncle Ted!"       and as she
      spoke, she lifted the slip-rails in place again and turned to him with a
      beaming face, out of breath, and so wildly excited that she could scarcely
      speak.
    
    
      "What is the matter, young 'un?" and the big man bent down and swooped her
      up into the saddle in front of him.
    
    
      "Oh, Uncle Ted, this is the very, very first time in my life that I was
      glad you were away!"
    
    
      "How's that?"
    
    
      "Aunt Lizzie let me sleep with her last NIGHT."
    
    
      A great joy came into Westonley's heart. "Did she? Really and truly?"
    
    
      "Really and truly! And oh, Uncle Ted, it was lovely! We talked and talked
      and talked for such a long time, and she told me such a lot of things
      about the school she was at in England, and about the girls there       some
      were very nice, but there were some horrid ones. Oh, she told me heaps of
      things. It was lovely, and we had Bunny in the room, too"       here she
      paused to catch her breath       "he tried to get in through the mosquito
      curtains, and got all tangled up, and tore a most enormous hole in them,
      and Aunt Lizzie only laughed, and said it didn't matter!"
    
    
      "You must have had a bully time."
    
    
      "Splendid! And Aunt Lizzie and I are going to the beach together one day
      next week to get pippies, and she says she won't mind if she gets sopping
      wet right up to her face."
    
    
      When they reached the house they found Mrs Westonley awaiting them on the
      verandah, and when her husband put his arms around her and kissed her
      repeatedly, she blushed like a young girl. And as the days went on he saw
      with delight that she had at last taken the child to her heart.
    
    
    
      Breakfast was over, and Westonley in his study was talking to his head
      stockman when he saw Brooke riding up.
    
    
      "Lizzie," he called to his wife, "here is Brooke. I expect he will have
      some breakfast, so tell Mrs Patton."
    
    
      Brooke, a tall, powerfully-built man, and usually as boisterous as a
      school-boy in his manner, seemed very quiet as he dismounted, shook hands
      with Westonley and his wife, and patted Mary's head.
    
    
      "Just in time for breakfast, Mr Brooke."
    
    
      "No, thank you, Mrs Westonley. I had mine at five o'clock       I made an
      early start, as I wanted to get here as soon as possible, thinking that
      very likely Westonley might be going out on the run somewhere, and that I
      might miss him. I want to have a talk with you, old man."
    
    
      Mrs Westonley and Mary at once left the room, both wondering what was the
      matter with Brooke       he looked so worried and depressed.
    
    
      "Westonley, old fellow," he said, as he sat down, "give me a big brandy
      and soda. I've ridden hard all the way from my place." Then he looked at
      the letters and newspapers still lying upon the breakfast table. The
      latter, he saw, were unopened. Drinking off the brandy and soda, he said:
    
    
      "You haven't opened your Argus yet, I see?"
    
    
      "No, we had some bad news about Tom Gerrard       he's been mauled by an
      alligator, and we haven't bothered about newspapers this morning."
    
    
      "Not seriously hurt, I trust?" anxiously asked the squatter, who had a
      sincere regard for Gerrard.
    
    
      "No, I am glad to say. I'll show you his letter presently. But what is the
      matter, Brooke? You look worried."
    
    
      "I am       most infernally worried. Tell me, old man, what did you do
      with that cheque of mine for eight thousand?" (The cheque to which he
      alluded was the price of the station in Central Queensland which he had
      bought from Westonley a few weeks previously.)
    
    
      "Paid it into my bank," replied Westonley, instantly surmising that
      Brooke's financial affairs had gone wrong.
    
    
      "Dacre's?"
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      "Westonley, old chap, I have bad news for you. I got a telegram from
      Melbourne last night       Dacre's Bank has smashed, and smashed badly       hopelessly,
      in fact."
    
    
      Westonley's florid face paled.
    
    
      "Smashed!"
    
    
      "Utterly smashed. Will it hit you hard?"
    
    
      "Break me! I had thirty thousand pounds on fixed deposit, a current
      account of about fifteen thousand       including the eight thousand you
      paid me, and every penny of my wife's money, little Mary's, and Jim's were
      in Dacre's," and, man as he was, his voice trembled.
    
    
      "It won't break you       by heavens, it shall not break you,
      Westonley! I bought Comet Vale from you for my boys, but I'll give it back
      to you for three       for five       years to help you to pull up."
    
    
      "Thanks, Brooke," and the big man grasped his friend's hand mechanically.
      "This has dazed me a bit. Come outside, and well talk it over."
    
    
      He rose unsteadily, placing his hand on the edge of the table, and then
      fell forward upon his face, and lay still       his big, generous heart
      had ceased to beat.
    
    
      When Brooke rode away late that night on his way home thinking of his dead
      friend, he reproached himself for so often having spoken of Elizabeth
      Westonley as "a pretty automaton, with as much heart in her as a doll."
      For her silent grief had showed him that she had loved her husband.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVI
    
    
      The news of Westonley's sudden death was a great shock to Gerrard. The
      brief telegram from his half-sister had been forwarded to Port Denison,
      and Lacey had sent it on to him at Fraser's Gully, by the mailman,
      together with a copy of the Clarion, containing the telegraphed
      account of the Dacre's bank failure. Had Gerrard looked at the newspaper,
      he might perhaps have connected Westonley's sudden end with the financial
      disaster, which had brought ruin to so many thousands of Australian homes,
      for he knew that his brother-in-law banked at Dacre's. But Mrs Westonley
      had said nothing of the cause of her husband's death       "Edward died
      suddenly yesterday. Am writing you fully to-night to Port Denison" was all
      that she had said.
    
    
      "Dear old Ted!" he said as his eyes filled, and he saw before him the
      great, bearded face with the kindly, mirthful eyes, and heard the deep,
      gruff voice. "How can I tell Jim       the boy will be heartbroken."
    
    
      And Jim's grief almost unmanned "Uncle Tom," as the boy now called him.
      Putting the telegram in his pocket, he went down to the battery, where his
      protégé was being inducted into the mysteries of amalgamation by
      Fraser.
    
    
      "Jim," he said quietly, "come along the creek with me for a bit of a
      stroll."
    
    
      "Is your face paining you much this morning, Uncle Tom?" said the boy, as
      they left the battery, and walked towards the creek, "you look quite
      white."
    
    
      "No, sonny," and he placed his hand affectionately on the boy's shoulder,
      "my face isn't paining me, but I have a thundering big pain in my heart,
      Jim       a pain which you must share with me. I have just had a telegram
      'from Marumbah       with very, very sad news."
    
    
      "Is it about Mary?" and the boy's lips quivered; "is she sick, Uncle?" and
      then, with a gasp       "is she dead?"
    
    
      "No, sonny, Mary is all right, but Mr Westonley is dead," and then he told
      him all that he could tell.
    
    
      An hour later, when they returned to the house, and Kate Fraser wondered
      why they looked so quiet and depressed, Gerrard told her of the news he
      had received.
    
    
      "Poor Jim!" she said, as she put her arms round the boy, who was trying
      hard not to again break down.
    
    
      Then Gerrard went on to say that he would now have to change his plans
      somewhat.
    
    
      "I must get back to Port Denison tomorrow, Miss Fraser. I want to send
      some telegrams as well as letters. But as it will take my sister's letter
      quite a fortnight to come from Marumbah, I shall put in most of the time
      at Kaburie, and, if I may, also inflict myself upon your father and
      yourself occasionally."
    
    
      "Do. We shall be so glad."
    
    
      Two days later he and Jim were back in Port Denison, and lunching with
      Lacey at the Queen's Hotel. Then for the first time Gerrard heard of the
      Dacre bank failure.
    
    
      "It must have been a fearful shock to poor Ted," he said to Lacey; "and
      perhaps it was that that killed him, for, as you say, the bank suspended
      on Saturday, and he died early on the Monday following. I fear he must
      have been hit very badly by the smash, for he not only had a lot of money
      in it, but was a big shareholder in the concern as well."
    
    
      "That's unfortunate, for yesterday's news gives further revelations of the
      smash, which is the very worst that has occurred in the Colonies. Every
      one thought that Dacre's bank was as solid as the rock of Gibraltar."
    
    
      This intelligence disturbed Gerrard greatly       so much so that after
      lunch he sent a telegram to Westonley's Melbourne agents       who were
      also his own       and asked them if they could tell him how his sister
      would be affected by the collapse of Dacre's. In a few hours he received
      an answer       "Deeply regret to say everything will be swept away."
    
    
      "Poor Lizzie!" he said to Lacey after dinner, as they sat on the verandah
      smoking; "this will be terrible news for her       if she does not already
      know of it. Thank God, I can help her to some extent," and he meant to
      "help" her by giving her Kaburie, for which he had only a few days
      previously sent Mrs Tallis a draft upon his bankers for six thousand
      pounds.
    
    
      "You were lucky not to have had anything in Dacre's."
    
    
      "Very, for Westonley was always cracking it up to me. He urged me strongly
      only six months ago to buy a hundred shares       a pretty hole I should
      be in now if I had taken the poor fellow's advice."
    
    
      "Yes, indeed. But no one ever dreamt of Dacre's being anything but one of
      the soundest banks in the world It is a blackguardly affair       a cruel,
      shameless fraud       and I hope that the men who are responsible for it
      will each get seven years' hard labour."
    
    
      "They deserve it I suppose that Westonley, with Marumbah Downs, and Comet
      Vale, and the funds he had in Dacre's was worth a hundred thousand at
      least; and now my poor sister and little Mary Rayner will be absolutely
      penniless. Thank heaven, I did not take his advice, but stuck to the
      Capricornian Pastoralists' Bank."
    
    
      The editor of the Clarion gasped and dropped his cigar. But he
      quickly recovered himself, and turning his face away from Gerrard, puffed
      out volumes of smoke most energetically, considering what he should do. He
      soon decided. "Better tell him the grim truth at once," he thought.
    
    
      "Gerrard!"
    
    
      The change in his voice struck his companion       it was low, grave, and
      sympathetic.
    
    
      "What is it, Lacey? Now, out with it. You have something unpleasant to
      tell me, and don't like doing it. I'll bet you drinks that I can guess
      what it is. I saw you start when I mentioned the Capricornian
      Pastoralists' Bank. Has that 'busted' too?"
    
    
      "Yes. It smashed yesterday as a result of the Dacre collapse. The news was
      in my rag this morning."
    
    
      "Was it? I didn't look at the Clarion to-day. Is it a bad case?"
    
    
      "Very bad; about a shilling in the pound is all that will come out of the
      wreck. Will you be hard hit?"
    
    
      "Rather! Curls me up like a corkscrew. To pay Mrs Tallis her six thousand
      pounds I gave a mortgage on Ocho Rios for five thousand pounds as I only
      had about three or four thousand pounds in the Capricornian. I'm deuced
      lucky that it wasn't more."
    
    
      He rose from his seat and paced angrily to and fro on the verandah for a
      moment or two, then he stopped suddenly, and a smile lit up his scarred
      face.
    
    
      "What an ass I am, Lacey! The thing can't be helped, but only a little
      while ago I had made up my mind to give Kaburie to my sister; and now I
      can't pay for Kaburie, for my draft for six thousand pounds is worthless
      to Mrs Tallis, and all the labouring of mustering and branding has gone
      for nothing. Poor little woman! I am sorry for her! Isn't it a beastly
      mess?"
    
    
      "You think too much of others, Gerrard, and too little of yourself."
    
    
      "I don't! I'm very fond of being good to myself, I can assure you. But a
      smack in the face like this is enough to make a saint swear like an
      Australian Member of Parliament. Now, I bought Kaburie with the idea of
      making it a breeding station       prize cattle and all that sort of thing       for
      Ocho Rios. Then when I received this telegram from my agents in Melbourne
      telling me that my sister would be left penniless, I made up my mind to
      write to her by the next mail south, and tell her that Kaburie was for her
      and my niece Mary. And another thing I wanted to do was to give a man I
      know a good lift." (He meant Fraser.) "And now I'll be as good as
      stony-broke for the next two years."
    
    
      "I wish I could help you," began Lacey, earnestly.
    
    
      "Thanks, old man. It is awfully good of you, but I shall pull through all
      right in the end, and with a good season or two should easily lift the
      mortgage on Ocho Rios. All I am scared of now is a drought, but if a
      drought does come, I can't stop it, and therefore, it is no use my
      worrying about it." He hoisted his feet upon the table, and touched the
      bell for the waitress. "Well, thank heavens, Lacey, I still have a thirst,
      and an iced brandy and soda is very soothing to the nerves. Milly, bring
      the ice again please, and if you see the boy tell him to come here."
    
    
      Jim soon appeared, still looking subdued and depressed.
    
    
      "Sit down here, old son, and have a long drink of ginger ale with a lump
      of ice in it," and he put his hand on the boy's arm, and made him sit down
      between himself and Lacey. "Jim, my son, I've just had some beastly bad
      news. I've lost a lot of money, and you and I will have to work like
      niggers when we get to Ocho Rios. Savvy?"
    
    
      "Yes, Uncle Tom. I will work very, very hard for you."
    
    
      "For us both, Jim, and for Mary and Aunt Lizzie; for we are all in the
      same boat I'll tell you the whole yarn by and by; but for the present well
      talk about something else for a change."
    
    
      Lacey looked at him in silent admiration and wonder. "Nothing can disturb
      the equanimity of such a serene mind," he thought, "and I like him for
      taking the youngster into his confidence like that."
    
    
      "I wonder what made Aulain leave so suddenly," said Gerrard, as Milly
      appeared with the ice, and the ginger ale for Jim. "It was strange of him
      not to even leave a note for me."
    
    
      "Oh! when a man has fever he does very queer things. All he told me was
      that he was off to Brisbane to tender his resignation in person, and as
      that is against the regulations he hoped to be dismissed. He has been very
      strange lately. I think that matters have gone wrong in a certain
      quarter."
    
    
      Gerrard nodded. "I know. Well, I'm sorry if it is the case. She is a bonny
      little lady."
    
    
      Milly again appeared. "If you please, Mr Gerrard, Sergeant Macpherson
      would like to see you for a few minutes on important business."
    
    
      "All right, Milly! Ask him to come up. Jim, I hope you haven't been up to
      any games while I was away."
    
    
      The local Sergeant of Police was shown up.
    
    
      "Good evening, sir," he said. "I have just had a wire from Cardwell from
      Inspector Sheridan, saying that news had come through by the mail boat
      from Somerset, that there has been a very bad bush fire up your way, and
      Ocho Rios station is destroyed."
    
    
      "Any lives lost?"
    
    
      "No, sir, but the fire spread all over the run for fifty miles about, and
      your stockman thinks that there are hardly two hundred head of cattle left
      I am sorry to bring you such bad news, sir."
    
    
      "Oh! don't apologise, Sergeant," was the quiet reply, "I'm getting used to
      bad news. Milly, bring a chair for Mr Macpherson, and another big glass,
      and some more ice. Now sit down, Sergeant, and tell me all about it. Jim,
      get off that railing, or you'll fall off into the street, and break your
      leg. My luck is dead against me. Light your pipe, Sergeant, and make
      yourself comfy."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVII
    
    
      "The saying that misfortunes never come singly seems to be verified in
      your case, Mr Gerrard," said Kate Fraser, as, a fortnight after he had
      received the news of Westonley's death, he was relating his disastrous
      experiences to her and her father.
    
    
      "Looks like it, doesn't it? But there are lots of fellows who have had
      worse luck than me, and so I shouldn't 'make a song' over mine. Now, do
      you know the story of Knowles's life?"
    
    
      "No, he has never told us."
    
    
      "Well, he told it to me yesterday" (Gerrard had been to Kaburie to tell
      the dapper little overseer that he could not pay for the station, and that
      he, Knowles, must re-take possession as manager for Mrs Tallis), "and I
      think the poor little chap only related it out of pure sympathy for me
      when I explained to him how I was fixed, and how sorry I was for him       as
      well as for myself       for I had doubled the salary he was receiving
      from Mrs Tallis."
    
    
      "He told me that," said Kate, and her eyes sparkled with fun.
    
    
      "Naturally, he would tell you" and Gerrard, with a faint quiver of
      one eyelid, gave Douglas Fraser a sly glance. "I am sure you must be the
      recipient of the confidences of all the country side, and would never
      'give any one away,' as vulgar persons like myself would say; so please
      don't 'give me away' to Knowles." Then his voice changed. "Miss Fraser,
      that little man is both a hero and a martyr. He was in the Naval Brigade
      at Sebastopol, and was recommended for the V.C. for distinguished bravery
      in one of the futile attacks on the Redan. Did you know that?"
    
    
      "No! He only told us that he was with Peel's Naval Brigade and had seen
      most of the fighting, was severely wounded, and that after he came home he
      left the Navy through ill-health, and came to Australia."
    
    
      "Well, he didn't get the Cross after all; that was his first bit of bad
      luck. Then his father, who was always looked upon as a very wealthy man,
      went smash for a huge amount, which ruined hundreds of people, and then
      shot himself; so poor Knowles left the Navy and took a billet as
      house-master at a boys' college. Six months after, his uncle, Lord
      Accrington, died, and left Knowles twenty thousand pounds. Of that twenty
      thousand pounds he kept only five hundred pounds; every penny of the rest
      he gave to his dead father's creditors."
    
    
      "How noble of him," said Kate. "It was indeed, 'but you see,' he said to
      me, 'I didn't want the money. My mother had died years before, and I have
      no brothers or sisters, and it would have been a disgraceful thing for me
      to have kept the money after what had occurred. Lord Accrington was my
      mother's brother, and I was always a favourite of his (he did not like my
      father, and had not spoken to him for years). I never expected he would
      leave me a cent, and so it was no sacrifice on my part' And then he said
      that ten years ago he had saved enough money to buy a small sheep station
      in the Riverina District, and then came the drought of '72 which broke
      him."
    
    
      "Poor fellow!" said Kate, "I shall like him now more than ever."
    
    
      Gerrard nodded. "One doesn't often come across such men. And, as I was
      saying, I have no reason to make a song over my affairs when so many other
      fellows have had worse luck than me."
    
    
      Douglas Fraser, who for the past few days had been depressed in spirits,
      said, as he rose from his seat:
    
    
      "True, Gerrard. It is of no use any one girding at his misfortunes, if
      they are not caused by himself. Sometimes a man thinks in mining parlance
      that he has 'struck it rich,' and straightway begins building his Chateaux
      en Espagne. Then he finds he has bottomed on a rank duffer, and wants to
      swear, as I do now." He smiled and spread out his chest, "Kate, I'm going
      up to the claim to see Sam Young."
    
    
      "And Mr Gerrard and I are going to the creek to catch some fish for
      supper."
    
    
      "Very well! I shall come back that way and join you," and the big man
      strode off to the claim       half a mile away.
    
    
      "Your father is not in his usual spirits, I think, Miss Fraser," said
      Gerrard, as he and Kate walked down to the fishing pool through the
      ever-sighing she-oaks which lined the banks of the creek.
    
    
      "He is not; the reef has been gradually thinning out, and Sam Young told
      him yesterday that he is afraid it will pinch out altogether. Last
      Saturday's cleaning up at the battery only yielded ten ounces of melted
      gold       worth about forty pounds       and the week's expenses came to
      one hundred and forty pounds. I am afraid, Mr Gerrard, that father and I
      and all the men will have to leave Fraser's Gully, and set our faces to
      the North, and leave the old battery behind us to the native bears and
      opossums and iguanas and snakes," and her voice faltered, for she dearly
      loved the place where she had spent so many happy years.
    
    
      "I am sorry," said Gerrard, musingly. "I suppose your father       if he
      does leave here       from what he said to me is thinking of going to the
      newly-opened gold fields on the Gilbert River?"
    
    
      "Yes, in that direction at any rate, prospecting as we travel. That is the
      one thing that consoles me; I love the idea of seeing new country."
    
    
      Gerrard made no answer for some minutes. He was thinking of a certain
      place on a creek, running into the Batavia River       the place "with a
      hunking big boulder standing up in the middle of a deep pool," of which he
      had spoken to Aulain, and he now half-regretted his promise to him to
      "keep it dark" for six months.
    
    
      "Of what are you thinking, Mr Gerrard?"
    
    
      "I was wondering if your father would care to make a prospecting trip up
      my way instead of going to the Gilbert rush. When I left Ocho Rios there
      were several prospecting parties on Cape York Peninsula       some of them
      doing very well       and I myself got seven ounces of gold in a few hours
      from a creek about sixty miles from my station. Unfortunately, however,
      another man as well as myself knows of this place, and he asked me not to
      say anything about it for six months. He means to go there with a
      prospecting party."
    
    
      "You mean Mr Aulain," and Kate turned her frank eyes to his.
    
    
      "How did you know?"
    
    
      She flushed. "You remember the letter you brought me from him. In that
      letter he told me that he was leaving the Native Police, and intended
      going in for mining, as he knew of some very rich auriferous country near
      your station, and that you, who also knew of it, had promised him to keep
      it secret from any other prospecting party."
    
    
      "Yes, I did. I should like to see Aulain 'strike it rich' as your father
      says, Miss Fraser," and then he smiled. "If only for the sake of my kind,
      patient nurse of last month."
    
    
      Again Kate's face flushed. "I know what you mean, Mr Gerrard, but              "
      she bent her head, and began to tie on a fishhook to the line she was
      carrying. "But you are mistaken. I like Mr Aulain very, very much, but I
      do not like any one enough to       to       oh, dear! I've broken the
      snooding."
    
    
      "Never mind, I'll fix it for you," and as his hand touched her's, a new
      hope came into his life. He knew what she meant him to understand       that
      she was not going to marry Aulain       and then he went on quickly.
    
    
      "I gabble like an old woman, do I not, Miss Fraser? Oh, this is what I was
      about to say, I believe that the Batavia River district is full of rich
      reefs and alluvial gold as well, and from what I hear from Lacey, I don't
      think the Gilbert will prove a permanent gold-field. Now, I will try to
      persuade your father to come to my part of the country instead of the
      Gilbert, which, by the time he reaches it, will probably be played out
      altogether, and abandoned."
    
    
      "Ah! do persuade him, Mr Gerrard; I liked the thought of our going to the
      Gilbert, but I like better       oh, ever so much better       your
      suggestion of the Batavia River, for there we should be near the sea; and
      I love the sea and the beaches. I am horribly selfish, I am afraid."
    
    
      Gerrard stroked his beard meditatively. "Yes, you'll be near the sea, Miss
      Fraser. But it is an awful country for a lady to live in; the fever is
      very bad there, and the blacks are a continual source of danger and
      trouble."
    
    
      "Anything that my father can go through I can face too," she said proudly;
      "and besides that I have had fever, am not afraid of blacks or anything       except
      alligators," and she shuddered, as she smiled.
    
    
      "Then you will be in a continual state of fear. All the rivers on the
      Peninsula are alive with them, and I have lost hundreds of cattle by the
      brutes." Then he laughed. "But they won't get many this year."
    
    
      "How bravely he takes his misfortunes," she thought. Then she said, "Well,
      I shall take good care of myself, and not cross any creeks if the water is
      not clear. Now here we are at the pool. Isn't it lovely and quiet? I do
      hope we shall have caught enough fish by the time father comes."
    
    
      Gerrard, as he filled his pipe, watched her smooth, slender brown hands
      baiting the hook of her line with a small grasshopper, and noted the
      beautiful contour of her features, and the intent expression in her
      long-lashed eyes as she surveyed it. She looked up.
    
    
      "Now, Mr Gerrard what are you doing? Don't be so lazy. I'll have at
      least three fish before you have your line ready. Oh, I do wish I were a
      man!"
    
    
      "Why?"
    
    
      "Because then I could smoke a pipe when I am fishing. It must be
      delightful! When father and Sam Young and Cockney Smith come here with me
      to fish, and I see them all looking so placidly content with their pipes
      in their mouths, I feel as if I was missing something. Now, watch!"
    
    
      She made a cast with her light rod of bamboo, and almost at the same
      moment that the impaled grasshopper fell upon the glassy surface of the
      pool it was seized by a fish of the grayling species; known to
      Queenslanders as "speckled trout."
    
    
      "There you are!" she cried triumphantly, as she swung the silvery-scaled
      beauty out of the water, and deftly grasped it with her left hand. "First
      to me."
    
    
      The music of her laugh, and her bright, animated features, filled Gerrard
      with delight as he watched her make a second cast. Then he too set to
      work, and, for the next quarter of an hour, they vied to make the greatest
      catch. Gerrard was a long way behind, when Douglas Fraser appeared. He was
      saying over and over again to himself: "There is nothing between her and
      Aulain! there is nothing between them!" Then, as he put his hand to his
      scarred face, the wild elation in his heart died away.
    
    
    
      "Well, young people, what luck?" said the burly mine-owner, as with his
      hands on his hips, he leant against a she-oak.
    
    
      "Splendid, father! thirty-five. How is the reef going?"
    
    
      "Pinched out all together, chick. We can hang the battery up now."
    
    
      Kate laid down her rod, and covered her face with her hands, and Gerrard
      saw the tears trickling through her fingers. For she loved the Gully, as
      she had loved no other place before.
    
    
      Fraser stepped over to her, and placed his hand on her bent head.
    
    
      "Never mind, little girl! We'll strike it rich some day."
    
    
      "Yes, father!" she whispered, as she smiled through her tears, "we shall
      strike a patch some day."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVIII
    
    
      On their way home, Gerrard and Fraser discussed the position, and Kate's
      heart beat quicker when her father said, "I think you are right, Gerrard.
      Ill give up the idea of the Gilbert, and shall try my luck on the
      Batavia."
    
    
      "Very well, it is settled. We can leave by the next steamer for Somerset."
    
    
      "I meant to overland it."
    
    
      "Don't think of it. It is over a thousand miles, and you would have to
      pass through some fearful country, full of poison bush, and would perhaps
      lose all your horses. Then, too, the blacks are bad, very bad."
    
    
      "Some of my men will be sure to come with me; especially Young and Smith."
    
    
      "Don't think of overlanding it," persisted Gerrard. "It would take you,
      even with the best of luck, two months to get to the Batavia. Come with me
      to Somerset. I think we can get all the horses we want there, and then we
      can go across country       only one hundred and fifty miles       to the
      Gulf side; if not, I'll hire one of the pearling luggers to take us round
      by Cape York."
    
    
      So Douglas Fraser yielded, and when they reached the house, he sent word
      to the claim and battery for all the men to come to him.
    
    
      "Boys," he said, as the toil-stained, rough miners filed into the
      sitting-room, "we'll have to clear out of the Gully now that the reef has
      pinched out. Now, Mr Gerrard tells me that there is both good reefing and
      alluvial country up about the Batavia River; all the creeks carry gold; so
      I am going there with him, Will any of you come in with me?"
    
    
      Every one of them gave a ready assent.
    
    
      "Why, boss," said Sam Young, "we coves ain't agoin' to leave you an' Miss
      Kate as long as we can make tucker and wages       or half wages, as fur
      as that goes. What say, lads?"
    
    
      "Of course you can't leave us," said Kate with a laugh; "you all know what
      it is to have a woman cook."
    
    
      "An' a lady doctor for them as have jim-jams," said one of them, looking
      at Cockney Smith, who shuffled his feet, and stared at something he
      pretended to see outside.
    
    
      The matter was soon concluded, and the few following days were spent in
      crushing the last of the stone from the claim, and having a final clean-up
      of the battery. And Douglas Fraser could not help a heavy sigh escaping
      him, as he looked at the now silent machinery, and the cold, fireless
      boiler, to be in a few years hidden from view by the ever-encroaching
      forest of brigalow and gum trees.
    
    
      Knowles, when he heard they were going, came to say good-bye. He looked so
      dejected that Kate felt a real pity for him; especially now that she knew
      the story of his life.
    
    
      "I'll be as lonely as a bandicoot after you go," he said frankly, as he
      twisted his carefully-waxed moustache; "and, by Jove, if I were not bound
      to stay at Kaburie for Mrs Tallis, I would ask your father to let me make
      one of his party. I don't know anything about mining, but I could make
      myself useful with the horses       sort of a cow-boy, you know."
    
    
      "I really do wish you could come with us, Mr Knowles. We shall miss you
      very much. Father, when he looked at his chess-board yesterday, heaved
      such a tremendous sigh, and I knew that he was thinking of you, and
      wondering if he will ever find any such another player."
    
    
      "Ah! I shall miss my chess, too. Still, one never knows what may happen,
      and it is possible that some day you may see me up on the Batavia, looking
      for a billet on some cattle station. I would go now if I could. But I must
      stick to Mrs Tallis, at least until she gets another manager."
    
    
      "She won't let you leave Kaburie, Mr Knowles. She likes you too much; she
      told me so." The little man's face suffused with pleasure. "It was very
      good of her. But I should like her ever so much more if she would give me
      a better salary."
    
    
      "Ask her       she won't refuse you."
    
    
      "Ah! I wouldn't have the courage; a lady, you see, is different from a
      man."
    
    
      "Write       that is easy enough. Now, promise me. And I can positively
      assure you that she will only be too glad." She put her hand on his. "Do
      promise me."
    
    
      "I can refuse you nothing. But I need not write, for I think it very
      likely that now the sale of Kaburie is 'off' with Mr Gerrard, she will
      come back there to live. I had a telegram from her yesterday, in which she
      said that she might come back next month."
    
    
      "Then, Mr Knowles, you will have to propose to her       that will be ever
      so much better than asking her for a bigger salary," and Kate laughed.
    
    
      The ex-sailor blushed like a girl, then he tugged furiously at his
      moustache. "By Jove, Miss Fraser, I       I       you don't know       I       if
      I were not so old, and not so beastly poor       I was going to ask you
      to marry me. There, it's out now, and you'll think me an ass."
    
    
      Kate's manner changed. What she had feared he would one day say, he had
      now said, and she felt sorry for him.
    
    
      "I think that you are such a man that any woman should be proud to hear
      what you have said to me, Mr Knowles," she said softly. "I know more about
      you than you think I do. But I shall never marry. I am going to stick to
      my father, and grow up into a nice old maid with fluffy white hair."
    
    
      "You are not offended with me?"
    
    
      "Offended! No, indeed. I feel proud that you should think so much of me as
      to have thought of asking me to be your wife," and she put out her hand to
      him. He raised it quickly to his lips, and then saying something
      incoherent about his wanting to see Cockney Smith's kangaroo pups,
      hurriedly left the room.
    
    
      "That was over soon," breathed Kate, as she watched his well-set little
      figure striding across the paddock to Smith's humpy. "He is a
      gentleman, if ever there was one in the world."
    
    
      "What is the matter, little one?" asked her father, as he entered the
      room.
    
    
      "Nothing, dad. I was only looking at Mr Knowles going over to Smith's
      humpy to look at the new kangaroo pups."
    
    
      Fraseras eyes twinkled. He guessed what had occurred. "I suppose Charlie
      Broome," (the bank manager at Boorala) "will be the next, Kate. I had a
      letter from him this morning, saying he would be here to-morrow. You had
      one also, I saw."
    
    
      "Oh, he is concerned about Cockney Smith's account," said Kate serenely;
      "that is why he is coming, now that he knows we are going away."
    
    
      "Exactly," said Fraser, stroking his beard. "It's wonderful the interest
      he takes in Cockney Smith       an extraordinary-ordinary interest."
    
    
      "Father, don't make fun of me       I can't help it. And his letter to me
      was so silly that I was ashamed to show it to you       I really was."
    
    
      "Oh, well, I don't want to see it, my child. I've read too many
      love-letters when I was on the Bench       some of them so 'excessively
      tender,' as that old ruffian of a Judge Norbury used to say in Ireland,
      more than a hundred years ago, that I had to handle them with the greatest
      care, for fear they would fall into pieces. Now, who else is there that is
      going to solicit your lily-white hand       which isn't lily-white, but a
      distinct leather-brown       before we get away? Lacey, I suppose, will be
      the next."
    
    
      "Not he, dad       the dear, sensible old man! He is wedded to his 'rag,'
      as he calls the Clarion. But, at the same time, I do look forward
      to seeing him again, and hearing his beautiful rich brogue       especially
      when he is excited."
    
    
      Gerrard came to the door.
    
    
      "May I come in?" he asked His eyes were alight with subdued merriment, as
      he displayed an open letter. The mailman from Port Denison had just
      arrived.
    
    
      "I have had a letter from my sister, Miss Fraser. She is leaving Sydney
      with my niece Mary, and coming to Ocho Rios. That is a bit of good luck
      for me, isn't it? And I am sure you and she and Mary will become great
      chums. She tells me that "       he hesitated a moment       "that as her
      affairs are in such a bad state she would like to come to me. And I am
      thunderingly glad of it Of course she doesn't know that Ocho Rios station
      has gone       in a way; but by the time she gets to Somerset       three
      months from now       she will find a new house, and we'll all be as happy
      as sandboys. Now, Miss Fraser, are you ready for an hour or two's fishing?
      You'll come too, Fraser?"
    
    
      "Won't I? Do you think I would miss the last chance of fishing in
      Fraser's Creek?" and the big man took down his fishing-rod and basket from
      a peg on the rough, timbered sides of the sitting-room.
    
    
      "Fill your pipe, dad, before we start."
    
    
      "Fill it for me, Miss," and Fraser threw a piece of tobacco upon the
      table, together with his pocket-knife.
    
    
      "And yours too, Mr Gerrard. I am a great hand at cutting up tobacco; I
      wish I were a man, and could smoke it. Oh, Mr Gerrard, I'm 'all of a
      quiver' to know that I shall see your little Mary."
    
    
      "So am I, 'quite a quivering," and then as Gerrard looked at her beautiful
      face, he remembered his own scarred features, and something between a sigh
      and a curse came from his lips.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIX
    
    
      As Mrs Westonley had told Gerrard in her letter that she and Mary would
      not leave Marumbah for quite two months and proceed direct to Somerset,
      where she hoped he would meet them, he decided to lose no more time at
      Port Denison; and so a week after the abandonment of Fraser's Gully, he
      and his friends found themselves on board a steamer bound to the most
      northern port of the colony, just then coming into prominence as the
      rendezvous of the pearling fleet, although Thursday Island was also much
      favoured.
    
    
      Before leaving Port Denison, he had written to his sister, and told her
      that he would meet her on her arrival at Somerset. "Jim is off his head
      with delight," he added; "in fact we both are, at the prospect of seeing
      you and Mary so soon. In one way I am glad that it will be barely three
      months before you get to Ocho Rios, for I want to get a new house put up;
      the present one isn't of much account"       this was his modified way of
      saying that there was no house there at all, it having been reduced to
      ashes, but he did not wish her to have the faintest inkling of any of his
      misfortunes, for fear that she would then refuse to add to his troubles
      and expenses by becoming a charge upon him. "And I have already bought
      some decent furniture, which I will take round with me in one of the
      pearlers. I do hope you will like the place, but you will look upon it at
      its very worst, for there have been heavy bush fires all about the
      station, which have played the deuce with the country for hundred of miles
      about. But the annual rains will begin to fall in four months, and then
      you will see it at its best. I am also going to make a garden, and plant
      no end of vegetables and flowers and things. There is a lovely little spot
      on one of the creeks; and Jim and I have been going over a thumping big
      box of seeds which I bought yesterday. You can consider that garden as
      made, with rock-melons and watermelons, and 'punkens' and other fruit
      growing in it galore."
    
    
      When Elizabeth Westonley read the letter she smiled       the first time
      almost since her husband's death. "How nice of your uncle, is it not,
      Mary? I should miss a garden dreadfully, and it is very thoughtful of him
      when he has so much work to do with his cattle. And see, he has sent me a
      draft for one hundred pounds for our expenses up to Somerset."
    
    
      "Are we very, very, poor now, Aunt?"
    
    
      "Very, very poor, Mary," and she sighed, "But still it might have been
      much worse for us if the people to whom Marumbah now belongs had not let
      me keep the furniture. Mr Brooke has bought it, and paid me three hundred
      and fifty pounds for it. And I am sure he only did it because he was sorry
      for us; I am certain he does not want it."
    
    
      Brooke, indeed, had been very kind to the wife of his dead friend, and had
      pressed her to accept a loan of money, but this she had gratefully
      declined.
    
    
      "How glad Uncle Tom must be that he has money to send you!"
    
    
      "I am sure he must be. He is always thinking of others; and you and I,
      Mary, must do all we can for him. I shall be housekeeper and cook and all
      sorts of things, and you shall be chief housemaid, and help me, and we
      will try and make the house look nice."
    
    
      "Yes, Aunt. And won't it be lovely to see Jim again! I can just imagine
      his staring eyes when he sees that I have brought Bunny. You'll keep it a
      dead secret, won't you?"
    
    
      "Quite secret. I did not even mention Bunny in my letter. Now we must go
      on sewing these mosquito curtains; your uncle says that in the rainy
      season the mosquitoes nearly eat one alive, so I am going to make six, as
      I am sure he has none at Ocho Rios. He says they don't bite him, as his
      skin is too tough."
    
    
      An hour before the steamer in which Gerrard and the Frasers had taken
      passage cast off her lines from the jetty, Lacey came on board to say
      farewell, bringing with him Mrs Woodfall. The kind-hearted woman was
      almost on the verge of tears as she sat down beside Jim, and folded him to
      her ample, motherly bosom.
    
    
      Gerrard presently drew her aside, and put two five pound notes in her
      hand.
    
    
      "Indeed I won't, sir. I like the lad too much! No, sir, not even as a
      present. But I do hope you won't mind his writing to us sometimes. And
      will you mind my saying, Mr Gerrard, that me and my husband are very sorry
      to hear that your station has been burned, and that you have lost nearly
      all your cattle. And we have taken a liberty which I hope won't offend you       it
      is only a present for Jim, and won't give you any trouble on board the
      steamer, and the freight is paid right on to Somerset, and my husband put
      five hundredweight of best Sydney lucerne hay on board, so you won't have
      no trouble in feeding him; and, although I say it myself, there's not a
      better bred bull calf in North Queensland."
    
    
      "Do you mean to say, Mrs Woodfall, that you have given Jim that Young Duke
      bull of yours? Why, he's worth fifty pounds! Oh no, I can't allow you to
      be so generous as that."
    
    
      "You can't help it now, Mr Gerrard," said the good woman triumphantly; "my
      husband brought him on board last night, and he is now in his stall on the
      fore-deck as happy as a king, and I hope he will prove his good blood when
      you once have him at Ocho Rios. Come and look at him," and she smiled with
      pride as she led the way out of the saloon.
    
    
      The animal was comfortably established in a stall on the fore-deck, and
      beside him was Woodfall feeding him with the "Sydney lucerne."
    
    
      "Woodfall, that bull is going ashore right away unless you take fifty
      pounds for him," said Gerrard; "he'll be worth five hundred pounds to me
      in a couple of years."
    
    
      "Can't take it, Mr Gerrard. He's a present to Jim, so it's no use talking.
      But I would take it as a favour if you'd send me a line, and tell me how
      he bears the journey."
    
    
      "Indeed I will, Woodfall," replied Gerrard, who was greatly touched by
      this practical demonstration of their regard for him; for he knew that
      their excuse of giving the bull to Jim was a shallow one, and that both
      husband and wife were aware that the animal would prove of the greatest
      value to him, now that Ocho Rios was practically without cattle. And such
      sympathy went to his heart. "The world is full of kind people," he
      thought. Then he turned to Mrs Woodfall and her husband with a smile.
      "Come back to the saloon with me. The steamer will leave in half an hour,
      and we shall not have much time to talk together. And the steward is
      giving us tea there."
    
    
      The big woman's face flushed with pleasure. "That is kind of you, Mr
      Gerrard. I can drink a cup of tea, but would be afraid to ask that swell
      steward for it; he looks like              "
    
    
      "Like a duke in disguise, eh? But he'll take a shilling tip from any one,
      I can assure you."
    
    
      "Well, I never! He ought to be ashamed of himself. English fashions are
      a-coming in, aren't they, Mr Gerrard? Just fancy any respectable man
      taking a shilling for doing the work he is paid for! Fifteen pound a month
      these steamer stewards get, so Mr Lacey tells me. My! But he won't get no
      shilling from me."
    
    
      "Indeed he shall not, Mrs Woodfall. You are my guest. Now come along,
      please, as Miss Fraser and the others will be waiting for us."
    
    
      "Mr Gerrard, isn't Miss Fraser a bonny girl       and can't she ride! I
      don't want to be rude, sir, but you will have to have a mistress for Ocho
      Rios; and she is one of the sweetest girls in the country, and right to
      your hand, so to speak."
    
    
      "Mrs Woodfall, you are surprising me. First you give Jim a bull
      calf worth hundreds of pounds, and then you try to fill my head with the
      idea that a young lady whom I have only known for a few weeks              "
    
    
      "Ah, Mr Gerrard! Trust a woman for knowing things that men don't see. I
      saw her looking at you in the saloon       and, well, I know a thing or
      two."
    
    
      "I am sure you do," said Gerrard laughingly, as they re-entered the
      saloon, "but I should have to get another face before I ask any one to
      marry me."
    
    
      "Not at all. Why, Mr Gerrard, in a year or so all those red scars will
      have gone, and you'll be the nice same nutty brown all over."
    
    
      "How are you, Gerrard?" said a little white-haired man in uniform. "I am
      glad to see you on board the Gambler once more. You'll share my
      cabin, of course?"
    
    
      "Thanks, Captain MacAlister, I shall be delighted," and then the master of
      the steamer, after an admiring glance at Kate, and a look of wondering
      sympathy at the left side of Gerrard's face, hurried on deck to the
      bridge.
    
    
      "Two big bottles of Pommery, steward; never mind the tea. Quick, please,"
      cried Lacey to the steward; "the skipper has gone on the bridge, and we'll
      just have time for a doch and dorrish, Miss Fraser." The steward soon had
      the bottles opened.
    
    
      "Gerrard, me boy, I wish you lashings of luck, and you too, Miss Fraser.
      Jim, my son, don't forget to write. Come, Mrs Woodfall; you really must,
      or I'll not speak to ye for a month. Here's to the bright eyes of the
      ladies! Miss Fraser, don't be after playing with any more alligators       they're
      nasty things for ladies to handle. Now I must be going; there's the last
      bell," and shaking hands all round once more, the genial Irishman left the
      saloon with the Woodfalls to go on shore, leaving Gerrard and his party to
      make their way on deck.
    
    
      The engines throbbed, and the great hull of the steamer slid slowly along
      the pier, and Gerrard and his friends went to the rail to see the last of
      Lacey. He, however, for the moment did not see them, as he was hurriedly
      writing in his pocket-book. Then tearing out the leaf, he looked up, and
      pushing his way through the crowd to the edge of the pier, was just in
      time to reach out and place the paper in Gerrard's hand.
    
    
      "Don't read it now," he cried, as he drew back; "put it in your pocket.
      Good-bye, and good luck."
    
    
      A few minutes later Captain MacAlister asked Gerrard and Fraser to come up
      on the bridge, and Gerrard unfolded Lacey's missive and read:
    

     "Just recognised one of your fellow-passengers       tall, stout,
     good-looking, yellow moustache, jewellery. Look out for him       
     noted card-sharper, and all-round blackguard. Calls himself
     Honble Wilburd Merriton, but has heaps of aliases       ex-gaol
     bird."

    
      Gerrard showed the note to Fraser, who nodded, and said he had noticed the
      man.
    
    
      "I think there is a party of them. See, there they are together at the
      companion; and, by Jove, I can swear to one of them! I tried him at
      Araluen for being concerned in gold-stealing, and gave him three years
      'hard.' That is he with the black moustache and Jewish features       Mr
      Barney Green."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XX
    
    
      Not only the saloon, but the steerage accommodation of the Gambier
      was taxed to the utmost, and Gerrard and Fraser were not surprised to see
      that there were quite a hundred diggers on board, for Lacey had told them
      a few days previously that the Sydney and Melbourne newspapers as well as
      the Queensland Press had, weeks previously, reported that many prospecting
      parties were doing well on both sides of Cape York Peninsula.
    
    
      Some of them the ex-judge quickly recognised as men he had met at Gympie
      and other Queensland gold-fields, and he was especially pleased to see one
      man       a tall, broad-shouldered Irishman named Blake, who at that
      moment was engaged in an altercation with the fore-cabin steward, and
      causing roars of laughter every few moments from his rough companions.
    
    
      "That's a 'broth av a boy,' and no mistake," said Captain MacAlister,
      coming over to Fraser and Gerrard; "he's as full of mischief as a monkey,
      but a great favourite with every one on board, except the unfortunate
      stewards. He is a lucky digger from Gympie, and came aboard at Brisbane,
      and has kept the ship in an uproar ever since. He took a four-berth
      state-room for himself, but only uses it to sleep in       if the devil
      ever does sleep       and spends all his time among the other diggers in
      the fore-cabin."
    
    
      "I know him," said Fraser with a smile. "Just listen now       he is
      taking a rise out of the poor steward."
    
    
      The fore-cabin steward, a fat, podgy, little man, was speaking; beside him
      was Cockney Smith, who kept giving him sympathetic punches in the back to
      go on.
    
    
      "I won't 'ave it, even if yer are a cabbing passinger. Wot do yer come
      into the fore-cabbing for, upsettin' me an' my men, and a-usin' langwidge
      when I can't open four dozen bottles of beer at onct. I never seed such a
      crowd! I'm alius willin' to oblige any man wot is thirsty, and wot wants a
      drink; but I aint a-goin' to attend on yer like a slave when I 'as
      cleanin' to do. So there, big as yer are, yer 'ave it       straight."
    
    
      "'Ear, 'ear," said Cockney Smith, who was thoroughly enjoying himself.
      "Who's a-goin' to be bullied by any cove because he is a cabbing
      passinger?" and he gave Blake an almost imperceptible wink.
    
    
      Blake outspread his huge hands and rolled up his eyes, in sorrowful
      indignation. "Me little mahn, I can see that ye and the steward mane to
      parsecute me, and make me loife a mishery       an' me doin' no harm at
      all, at all. Sure, I'll not stand it anny more. It's to the captain I'll
      go, and complain av ye both. He's a MacAlister, he is, an' I'll call on
      him to purtect me from your violent conduct       me sufferin' from a wake
      heart, an' liable to fall dead on yez at anny moment, when yez luk at me
      like that, wid that ferocioushness in yez eyes. Sure, an' me own father
      dhropped dead off the car he was drivin' whin an ould maid from Belfast
      gave him two sovereigns in mistake for two shillin's for takin' her from
      Dawson Street to St Stephen's Green. It was short-sighted she was, but it
      made me the poor orphan I am this minute."
    
    
      Amidst much laughter, the irate steward went off, and left the field to
      his antagonist, and then Douglas Fraser left the bridge, made his way
      forward, and clapping the Irishman on the shoulder, said:
    
    
      "At your old tricks again, Larry."
    
    
      Blake stared at him for a moment, and then gave a shout of delight as he
      seized Fraser's hand, and in a few seconds other diggers also recognised
      and crowded about him.
    
    
      "An' how's the wee girl?" was Blake's first question.
    
    
      "Come and see for yourself," and Fraser led the way to the saloon, where
      they found Kate. She was delighted to see the big digger, and blushed
      scarlet at his loudly expressed compliments, for there were a number of
      other passengers near. Leaving her with Blake, Fraser rejoined Gerrard,
      and together they went to the purser, whom they found in his cabin, and
      asked to see the passenger list. He was an old accquaintance of Gerrard's,
      and readily complied. Running down the names, they failed to see either
      that of Merriton or Green.
    
    
      "Who is that big, good-looking man with the yellow moustache, carrying
      field-glasses, Adlam?" asked Gerrard carelessly.
    
    
      "Oh," and the purser shrugged his shoulders. "Here he is," and he pointed
      to a name on the list       "'Captain Forreste.' He's one of a party of
      four, who have a cabin to themselves. They put on no end of frills, and
      practically boss the saloon. Between ourselves, I have every reason to
      believe they are a gang of sharpers. I know for a fact that one of them       this
      fellow here, 'Mr Bernard Capel'       has a hand-bag literally packed with
      unopened packs of cards, every one of which no doubt is marked. I happened
      to be passing their state-room late at night, after all the other
      passengers were asleep, and when the ship was rolling heavily. The door
      flew open, and I saw this fellow Capel and the big man Forreste had the
      bag open on the table, and there must have been at least twenty unopened
      packs of cards piled up on the table, besides those in the bag. I
      pretended I didn't notice, for the moment the door flew open, Capel called
      Forreste a                       idiot for not turning the key. Now, I
      haven't been pursering for ten years without learning something, and I can
      smell a swell-mobsman almost before I see him."
    
    
      Fraser nodded. "I daresay you are right, Mr Adlam. When a man travels with
      a handbag full of packs of cards one naturally would suspect that he was
      either very eccentric, or was a commercial traveller, with samples of his
      wares." His eyes twinkled. "It is a very old dodge that       an
      apparently unopened pack of cards, every one of which has been
      systematically marked, and then the wrapper with the revenue stamp is
      carefully put on again."
    
    
      "Just so," assented the purser. "And the other night, a big digger       one
      of our saloon passengers       was taken down by Forreste for a hundred
      and twenty pounds. The great Irish ass, however, thinks that Forreste is
      no end of a gentleman. The skipper and I gave him a hint, which he
      wouldn't take, however. The worst of it is that I must keep my mouth shut
      about the bag full of packs of cards. Diggers are rough customers, and if
      these now on board knew that Forreste and his friends were a gang of
      sharpers, they would handle them very severely, and create a fearful
      disturbance."
    
    
      "What is Mr Bernard Capel like?" asked Fraser.
    
    
      "Oh, a short, black-moustached chap with curly hair, and a hook nose,
      wears a lot of jewellery. The lady passengers think that he and Captain
      Forreste are most charming men."
    
    
      "Who are the other two?"
    
    
      "Pinkerton and Cheyne. They are as well-dressed as the others, but don't
      push themselves much       the other two are the bosses of the gang."
    
    
      Fraser thought a moment or two. Then he spoke.
    
    
      "I think I ought to tell you, Mr Adlam. I know the man who calls himself
      Capel. His real name is Barney Green, and he is a bad lot       gold thief
      and coiner. And I advise you to take good care of your safe. I daresay
      these four gentlemen have a very interesting collection of safe keys."
    
    
      Adlam laughed. "Ah, our Company has learnt something by experience. There,
      you see, is the safe which is supposed to contain all the money committed
      to my care; but there is nothing in it but loose cash; the safe that does
      hold all the money is here," and he tapped the varnished cedar panels of
      his bunk; "no one, even if he knew the secret, could get at it without
      disturbing me. When the strong room of the Andes was broken into
      five years ago, between Melbourne and Colombo, and six hundred-weight of
      gold bars stolen, I set my wits to work, and devised this idea of mine.
      Only the captain, chief officer, chief engineer, and myself, and, of
      course, the Company's general manager at Sydney, know of it; even my own
      bedroom steward has no idea that there is a second safe, although he turns
      out my cabin twice a week for a general cleaning. If he did discover the
      fact, I should have to shunt him at once, as he is quite a new hand in the
      service."
    
    
      "Well, you have given the secret away to us, Adlam," said Gerrard, with a
      laugh, "and I have had some bad luck of late."
    
    
      The purser laughed in unison, and then turning the key of his door, rose,
      went to his bunk, and touched a concealed spring in the heavy panelling at
      the back. It at once slid down noiselessly, and revealed the safe, about
      the sides of which were a number of electric wires and bells.
    
    
      "The current is turned off now," he explained, as he again touched the
      panelling, which ascended as quickly and softly as it had fallen; "but if
      any one did try to prize up the panelling, there would be a devil of a
      row; not only the six bells in this cabin but those in the captain's and
      chief mate's room would begin to ring, and keep ringing, and they and the
      chief engineer would know something was wrong. We have tried it several
      times when in dock, after clearing every one out of the ship but
      ourselves, and it works splendidly       kicks up a fearful din. Now, last
      voyage, independent of ten thousand ounces of gold in the strong room, I
      had seventeen thousand pounds in notes and sovereigns in that safe; this
      trip there is only about one thousand two hundred pounds, mostly
      passengers' money, and a packet of five thousand new unsigned one pound
      notes for the bank just opened at Cooktown. Now, I hope with four such
      gentry as we have on board that you and Mr Fraser will be careful; better
      give me your cash."
    
    
      "Thank you, I will," said Fraser; "I have seven hundred pounds in notes."
    
    
      "And I about three hundred pounds," said Gerrard.
    
    
      "Well, go and get them now if you will," said the obliging purser.
    
    
      This was done, and then the two friends, as they were returning to the
      bridge, met Kate.
    
    
      "I have honours conferred on me, father. Captain MacAlister is having
      afternoon tea in his cabin, and you, Mr Gerrard, and Jim are invited; I am
      to be hostess. In another hour I shall be the best hated woman on board."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXI
    
    
      It was past midnight, and the chief steward of the Gambier was taking a
      last glance through the empty saloon to see that everything was in order
      before he turned in, when Swires, the purser's bedroom steward, came to
      him.
    
    
      "If you please, sir, the gentlemen in No. 16 send their compliments, and
      would be obliged to you if you will let them have their lights on full for
      an hour or so for a game. And they want a couple of bottles of Usher's and
      a dozen of soda."
    
    
      "Why can't they play cards in the-smoking-room on deck?" grumbled the
      chief steward; "there's a man on duty there until two o'clock       they
      know that well enough. Who's going to wait on them, and see after the
      lights?"
    
    
      "I will, sir, if you don't mind," replied Swires, a clean-shaven,
      deferential young man with shifty eyes.
    
    
      "Well, it's against the rules. And if the skipper or the purser comes
      along, and finds you loafing about in, the alley-way when you ought to be
      turned in, I'll get into trouble as well as yourself. Captain Forreste is
      a very liberal gentleman, but he puts it on a bit too thick when he asks
      me to run risks." But as he spoke he took out his keys, and proceeded to
      open his sideboard lockers       he had already received several golden
      tips from Captain Forreste and his friends, and felt certain of more in
      the future.
    
    
      "I told the gentlemen, sir, that I would get into trouble if the purser or
      yourself seen me in the alley-way after eight bells, and they said that I
      might sit in their state-room until they had finished their game."
    
    
      "Oh, well, I suppose I must give in to 'em. Tell 'em not to make too much
      noise."
    
    
      As soon as Swires entered No. 16 with the whisky and sodas, Cheyne turned
      the key in the lock.
    
    
      "Well?" asked Forreste interrogatively, as the steward laid the bottles
      down in one of the berths.
    
    
      Helping himself to a cigar from a box on the table, the man lit it, and
      then sat down familiarly.
    
    
      "Well," he replied, "I've found out that we are going to coal from a
      collier at Cooktown       that's one thing. Another is that there is a
      dinner-party to be given on shore to the skipper by the saloon passengers
      on the night after we get there, and most likely the purser is going."
    
    
      "Ah," and Capel's black beady eyes glittered, "that'll be our chance."
    
    
      "Yes, we'll be coaling for about sixteen hours, beginning in the
      afternoon. There will be a dust screen put up just near the purser's
      cabin, because one of the bunker shoots is just a little for'ard of his
      door       see?"
    
    
      "Yes," and all four men bent eagerly towards Swires.
    
    
      "Well, there'll be a thundering clatter with the coals as they come
      pouring down from the upper deck, and that will be the time to get in, cut
      the wire, and do the job right away. There'll be no one this side of the
      dust screen after eleven at night, as most of the passengers will be
      ashore at the dinner, and those who don't go will be asleep."
    
    
      "Supposin' the flamin' purser don't go?" said Cheyne, a small, wiry,
      sunburned man, who, although like his confederates was extremely
      well-dressed, was an exceedingly illiterate man. He was Australian born,
      and from his youth upward, when not occupied in horse-stealing or
      thimble-rigging on bush race-courses, had spent the intervening time in
      gaol. Pinkerton, who was an American of a somewhat similar type to Cheyne,
      but of a more villainous nature, was an expert burglar, and a very fitting
      companion to the astute and well-educated Forreste, and the Jew, Barney
      Green.
    
    
      "Well, what if he doesn't?" responded Swires, turning to Forreste; "you've
      got the stuff for me to give him in his B and S before he turns in. You're
      always cacklin' about it. Where is it?"
    
    
      "Here you are," and Forreste went to his Gladstone bag, opened it, and
      took out a tin box containing a number of very small unlabeled phials,
      each holding about ten drops of colourless liquid. "Empty one of these
      into the tumbler before you put in the brandy, and he'll be dead to the
      world in ten minutes after he drinks it."
    
    
      "I'd like to know how many flimsies there are in that packet," said Capel.
    
    
      "We'll know before long," replied the steward. "It is a good big bundle. I
      seed the bank clerk give it to him in the saloon, and take a receipt for
      it, but couldn't get a look to see how much it was for."
    
    
      Discussion then followed as to the future movements of the gang after the
      robbery, and it was decided that Capel and Cheyne should take the plunder
      on shore and hide it, and the following morning they should inform the
      purser that they intended to remain at Cooktown instead of going on in the
      steamer to Somerset and the newly-discovered rushes further north. This
      would cause no surprise, for already a number of the diggers on board had
      formed a deputation to Adlam, asking him if he would make them a rebate on
      their passage money if they landed at Cooktown; explaining that they had
      learnt at Port Denison that it would be easier to get to the new
      gold-fields from Cooktown than from any other place to the north of that
      port.
    
    
      Swires was to receive a fifth share of the plunder, and was to desert from
      the ship as soon as possible after the robbery. He had long been
      associated with the gang, and indeed it was at his suggestion, made in
      Sydney, that they should attempt to open the ship's safe. After a
      separation of twelve months       spent in prison       from his former
      companions, he had succeeded by means of an excellent "discharge," which
      he had stolen from an unfortunate steward named Swires, in getting a berth
      on the Gambier, and the first thing he did was to look up Forreste
      and Capel, and suggest their all going to the new gold-fields, pointing
      out that there would be a great number of passengers on board, and that
      they were bound to do well.
    
    
      "That is just what we meant to do," Capel had said, "and we can wire to
      Cheyne and Pinkerton to join us. They are 'working' Bathurst just now, and
      will be here by to-morrow night." Then he added that it was a bit of luck
      that he (Swires) should be the purser's attendant       it would give them
      a very fair chance of making a big haul. If, however, they did not succeed
      in their anticipation of perpetrating any robberies or swindling on the
      voyage by cards, they knew that on a new gold-field they would have
      glorious opportunities. Swires       who really was a ship steward       they
      had become acquainted with in San Francisco, and had admitted into their
      fraternity. For quite two years they had "worked" the mail steamers
      between Sydney and San Francisco, fleecing the passengers who were foolish
      enough to be enticed into playing with them. Sometimes there would be but
      two of them       with Swires       sometimes three, and they usually took
      their passages separately, met on board as strangers, and, being always
      well-dressed, and very agreeable in their manners, soon ingratiated
      themselves with the rest of the passengers. Their lavish manner of living
      and courteous attention to ladies and children always paved the way to
      success; but at last they became too well known, and had to change their
      sphere of work from the American steamers       which are always infested
      by sharpers       to other lines. As "the Hon. Wilburd Merriton" the chief
      scoundrel of the gang had travelled all over the world, changing his name
      and appearance as occasion demanded. In the mining towns of California and
      Nevada he would be a wealthy English gentleman looking for suitable
      investments; on a Peninsular and Oriental liner from Melbourne to London,
      he would be either a college professor enjoying a twelve months' holiday
      trip, a squatter in the Northern Territory of South Australia, or the
      owner of a nitrate mine in Peru; and whatever role he played, he always
      succeeded in swindling some one. Women were his chief victims. His
      handsome appearance, fascinating manners, and easy courtesy were as fatal
      to a confiding woman as to the managers of banks who cashed his cheque
      when he was "temporarily short for a few hundreds." An excellent linguist
      in the principal Continental languages, he could also talk like, and
      assume the manners of, the rough gold-diggers with whom he so frequently
      associated for his nefarious purposes. Unlike his associates       the
      Jew, Barney Green (alias Capel), and Pinkerton and Cheyne       he had
      only once seen the inside of the prison, when as "the Hon. Wilburd
      Merriton" he was given a sentence of two years' hard labour for forgery in
      Auckland, New Zealand.
    
    
      Lacey, who was then editing a newspaper in that somnolent little city, had
      seen him in the dock, and heard something of his career; and so, when he
      saw him standing on the after-deck of the Gambier, he had given
      Gerrard his hurriedly scribbled warning.
    
    
      The discovery by Swires of the location of the secret safe in the purser's
      cabin had come about in a very simple manner. A plan of the electric
      connections between the dynamo in the engine-room, and Adlam's cabin and
      other parts of the ship, had come under his notice through the
      carelessness of the chief engineer, who had left it on the purser's table,
      and Swires had studied it so carefully that although he had not the time
      to make a copy, he had been able to explain the mechanism perfectly to
      Pinkerton and Capel. The unlocking of the door of the purser's cabin was a
      very easy matter to professionals like Cheyne, Pinkerton, and Barney
      Green, and so when their conference closed, and the oily-voiced steward
      bade the gang good-night, the latter were highly elated at the prospect of
      making a big haul with scarcely any danger of detection.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXII
    
    
      When the Gambier arrived at Cooktown at the mouth of the Endeavour
      River, a scene of the greatest activity presented itself, for several
      other steamers had just reached the port, some bringing European diggers
      from the southern colonies and New Zealand, and others from Hongkong with
      Chinese. The latter numbered over a thousand, and they landed amid a storm
      of execration and missiles from the white miners, who had preceded them to
      the shore. But the yellow men made no show of resistance, not even when
      some of their number were seized       and thrown into the water with
      their heavily weighted baskets; they crowded together like sheep, and
      gazed with stolid faces at the Customs officials remorselessly capsizing
      their baskets upon the ground, and kicking the contents apart in the
      search for opium. Bags of rice were cut open and the grain spilled upon
      the ground, to the delight of the white diggers, especially when a tin of
      opium was found, and the would-be smuggler had his pigtail tied to that of
      another until there were several groups of a dozen so secured to be driven
      to the roughly constructed jail and court-house, where justice was
      administered in an exceedingly expeditious manner by heavy fines. Had it
      not been that the angry diggers were anxious to get to the
      newly-discovered fields as quickly as possible, a riot would have taken
      place, for they knew that within a few weeks there would be thousands of
      Chinese alluvial diggers all over the country, enriching themselves and
      spending nothing, for they brought even the greater part of their food
      with them from China. But the fatuous Government of the day wanted to
      swell its depleted treasure-chest, and the Chinese poll-tax brought in
      money quickly. All over North Queensland the rich alluvial gold-fields
      were soon to be occupied by the yellow men, to the detriment of the white
      diggers who were hastening to them from all parts of Australasia to meet
      with bitter disappointment, for the swarms of Chinese would descend upon a
      newly opened rush like locusts, and in a few weeks work out a field that
      would have made hundreds of white miners rich, though perhaps each
      Chinaman might not have obtained more than a few ounces of gold, every
      penny-weight of which he sent or took back to his native country. Amongst
      other passengers on the quarterdeck of the Gambier who were
      watching the examination of the Chinese were Captain Forreste and his
      friends. Presently Capel, who was looking at Kate so impertinently that
      she turned her face angrily away, caught her father's eye, and in a moment
      the Jews features flushed. Where had he seen those keen grey eyes and that
      square-set face before? Fraser continued to gaze steadily at the man, for
      he had noticed the fellow's leering glance at his daughter, and meant to
      resent it.
    
    
      Then the Jew's natural effrontery came back to him, and returning Fraser's
      look with an insolent stare, he walked up to him.
    
    
      "I hope you'll know me again the next time you see me."
    
    
      "I know you as it is, Mr Barney Green, and the next time you dare to even
      look at my daughter, I'll give you something to remember. Meantime, take
      this as an earnest of my intentions."
    
    
      His right hand shot out and seized Capel by the collar, and twisting him
      off his feet, he spun him round and round, and then sent him flying across
      the deck with such violence that he struck the rail on the other side and
      fell in a heap.
    
    
      For a few moments there was an astonished silence, and then cries of "What
      is the matter?" "What did he do?" resounded on all sides as Pinkerton and
      Cheyne rushed to the fallen man, who lay unconscious. Forreste, twisting
      his yellow moustache, strode up to Fraser, his face pale with anger.
    
    
      "What is the meaning of this outrageous assault upon my friend?" he
      demanded fiercely.
    
    
      Fraser eyed him up and down with cold contempt, and then Gerrard said with
      a pleasant drawl, as he stroked his beard:
    
    
      "Run away and play, Mr       er       Mr       I really forget your name.
      Oh, Merriton, is it not?"
    
    
      Forreste's face purpled with passion, and he took a step nearer to
      Gerrard, who was quite ready for him. Then he stopped and said hoarsely:
    
    
      "My name is Forreste. I don't know yours, but I do know that if I catch
      you on shore I'll add some further adornment to your face."
    
    
      "Oh, you contemptible creature, to say that!" and Kate looked at him with
      blazing eyes.
    
    
      Forreste raised his immaculate Panama to her. "This is hardly a matter for
      a lady's interference."
    
    
      "Better see to your friend for the present," said Gerrard in the same
      placidly pleasant manner, as he drew him aside. "But I may mention before
      you go that there is, on the lower deck, ample space if you wish to fulfil
      your promise to complete the adornment of my prepossessing features. I am
      quite at your service later on in the day."
    
    
      Forreste uttered an oath and turned away, and in a few minutes was in
      state-room No. 16, where "Mr Capel" was being brought to by his friends.
    
    
      "Who is the man that did it, Barney?" was Forreste's first question.
    
    
      "I didn't know him at first, but knew him quick enough when I heard him
      speak," replied Capel; "he's the                       judge"       here
      he broke out into a torrent of blasphemy       "who gave me two years at
      Araluen."
    
    
      "Ha!" and Forreste tugged his moustache. "The sooner we get that safe
      affair over the better. The fellow with the scarred face who is with him
      tackled me and called me 'Merriton.' Some one has blown upon us."
    
    
      "Yes," assented the Jew, "the sooner the better." Then pouring out a glass
      of whisky he gulped it down. "And if I get the chance I'll get even with
      that Scotch swine. He's going to Somerset, and I'll get my knife into him
      some day. I'd not mind swinging for it."
    
    
      "Don't talk rot," said Forreste, who yet knew that the Jew was a man who
      would not hesitate at murder, and that his expression about getting his
      knife into Fraser was meant in a very literal sense. "I mean to get even
      with my man if I come across him again. But I won't be such a fool as to
      attempt it here. Take a look outside and see if Snaky is about."
    
    
      "Snaky" was the name by which Swires was known to the gang       and the
      Australian police; and in a few minutes that worthy appeared, and a
      further conference was held.
    
    
      That evening, whilst Captain MacAlister was being entertained on shore, a
      collier came alongside, and the Gambier began to coal. Those of the
      saloon passengers who had remained on board sat under the after-deck
      awning, where they were not only secure from the invading coal dust, but
      where they could enjoy the cool sea-breeze. Among them were Kate and Jim,
      who had made themselves comfortable in two cane lounges, and at various
      parts of the quarter-deck were groups of passengers       principally
      ladies       who were glad to escape from the confined atmosphere of the
      saloon, and intended to sleep in the open air. Gerrard and Fraser had gone
      on shore, leaving Jim "in charge of Kate," as Fraser had said.
    
    
      At the extreme stern were Captain Forreste, Pinkerton, two or three other
      men, and several ladies, and from this group came much laughter, the
      "captain" being in great good humour, and winning the ladies' smiles by
      his skill as a raconteur.
    
    
      "And so you are deserting us to-morrow morning, Captain Forreste," cried a
      vivacious young matron; "it is too bad of you. The rest of the voyage will
      be dreadfully triste       for me at any rate." Every one laughed.
    
    
      The gallant captain smiled winningly. "Ah, Mrs Marriott, do not make me
      vain. Yes, we are going to leave you. In fact we should have all gone
      ashore this evening, but my unfortunate friend, Mr Capel, is not yet fully
      recovered from the brutal attack to which he was subjected."
    
    
      "It was most disgraceful and wicked," chimed in a second lady.
    
    
      "And cowardly as well," added a fat, sleepy-faced dame. "I believe poor Mr
      Capel was taken quite by surprise."
    
    
      "And the way that horrid girl flew at you!" said Mrs Marriott; "but her
      father being such a horrible bully I suppose she has inherited some of his
      disposition. She is certainly pretty in a coarse kind of a way, I admit,
      but terribly gauche. And I really am quite angry with Captain
      MacAlister       he positively trots after her. She is continually
      on the bridge with him, and yet he has refused to permit any other ladies
      to go there, ever since we left Sydney. I think it is scandalous, for I
      know that Captain MacAlister is a married man with grandchildren."
    
    
      The hours passed by, and then at eleven o'clock, to the anger of Forreste,
      Adlam sauntered up. He had been to the dinner, but had left early. Seating
      himself beside Kate and Jim, he pulled the boy's ear.
    
    
      "So you are taking care of Miss Fraser, eh, Jim? Lucky man!"
    
    
      "Just listen to that now!" said the fat lady to Mrs Marriott. "One would
      think that Mr Adlam would have more sense than to flatter that girl's
      vanity. He has quite deserted us since she came on board at Port Denison."
    
    
      Kate, serenely unconscious of the criticisms being passed upon her, was
      listening to the purser's description of the excited state of Cooktown,
      when Swires appeared, and said to Adlam:
    
    
      "When are you turning in, sir?"
    
    
      "In a few minutes, Swires. You can leave my nip and bottle of soda on the
      table. I shall not want you any more to-night."
    
    
      "Very good, sir."
    
    
      Adlam remained with Kate a few minutes longer, then said good-night, and
      went to his cabin. Swires, as usual, had placed a tumbler with some brandy
      in it on the table, and beside it lay the soda. The purser took off his
      clothes, and got into his thinnest pyjamas, for the cabin was close; but
      he had made up his mind to stay in his cabin that night, for the sole
      reason that he was now very suspicious of Captain Forreste and his party,
      and had made up his mind to suffer the discomfort of a hot cabin, and the
      noise of the coaling going on as long as they were on board. Forreste had
      told him in the afternoon that he and his party were staying at Cooktown,
      much to his satisfaction.
    
    
      Eight bells struck, and then noise of the falling coals suddenly ceased       the
      lumpers were taking the usual half-hour "spell." Adlam opened the soda,
      and the listening Swires heard the pop of the cork, and stole softly into
      No. 16, where he found the gang awaiting him.
    
    
      "Well, he's taken his B and S," he said, "and that finishes my part of the
      contract." (Earlier in the evening he and Pinkerton had opened Adlam's
      door, and the latter had quickly cut the electric communication of the
      secret safe. The opening of it later on would not be a difficult matter to
      such an expert as the American.)
    
    
      "And we'll do ours presently," said Capel, who was now quite recovered.
      "How long will that dose keep him quiet?" he asked of Forreste.
    
    
      "Two hours. As soon as you have the work done, Pinky and Cheyne can take
      the stuff on shore. I've told the chief steward that we had all thought of
      going for a stroll on the beach, but that I did not care about leaving Mr
      Capel, and that as our cabin is not very hot, we should not sleep on deck.
      When will the coaling start again, Snaky?"
    
    
      "Twenty minutes or so."
    
    
      "Very well. Well wait until one o'clock, eh, Barney?"
    
    
      The Jew nodded, and then Swires left them, and Forreste put out the
      electric light.
    
    
      About half-past one Pinkerton and Cheyne appeared on the after-deck, and
      sauntered up and down for a few minutes. There were several other male
      passengers still awake, and with these the two men exchanged a few words.
    
    
      "Will you come with us for a stroll on the beach?" said Pinkerton to a
      sleepy man who was lying on the skylight.
    
    
      "No jolly fear; I'm too comfy as I am, and I know what the mosquitoes are
      on Cook town beach."
    
    
      Cheyne made some laughing rejoinder, and then he; and his companion went
      to the gangway and walked leisurely along the jetty. An hour or so later
      they returned, and settled themselves comfortably with pillows on one of
      the long deck seats.
    
    
      In state-room No. 16 Forreste and Capel were conversing in angry,
      whispered tones.
    
    
      "How was I to know that he hadn't taken your cursed dose?" snarled the
      Jew; "and what else could I do but settle him when he awoke? Anyway, we
      have nothing to be afraid of. We have got the stuff, and by this time
      Pinky and Cheyne have it safely planted, and there will be no evidence to
      connect us with the job. Curse you! what are you funking it for? We'll be
      on shore at five o'clock, the steamer leaves at six, and the purser is
      never called until seven; and when he is called and doesn't answer, they
      won't break open his door for at least two or three hours. And by this
      time he has fifty tons of coal on top of him, and there's more coming down
      every minute. Listen!"
    
    
      Forreste, criminal as he was, was not so callous as Green, and shuddered
      as he heard the coals rattling down into the bunkers.
    
    
      "Was he quite dead when you dropped him down into the bunker?" he asked,
      as with shaking hand, he poured some whisky into a tumbler.
    
    
      "Dead as you will be some day, you white-livered cur!" said the Jew with
      savage contempt. Then opening the port, he dropped Pinkerton's burglar's
      tools over into the water. "There! there goes Pinky's kit. All we have to
      do now is to go on deck       you to blarney with the women, who are
      awake, and me to play the interesting invalid who was subjected to a
      violent and unprovoked attack," and he leered evilly.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXIII
    
    
      "Well, Lizzie, how does the Ocho Rios country strike you?" and Gerrard
      pulled up his horse under the grateful shade of a great Leichhardt tree
      standing on the bank of a clear, sandy-bottomed creek.
    
    
      "I think it is beautiful, Tom, almost tropical, especially anywhere near
      the sea," and Mrs Westonley jumped lightly from her horse. "Are we going
      to spell here for awhile?"
    
    
      "Yes. Here come Jim and Mary with the pack-horse, and as it is past
      twelve, we'll have our dinner, rest an hour, and then take the beach way
      home."
    
    
      Eight months had passed since Mrs Westonley and Mary had come to Ocho
      Rios, and they had been eight months of work and happiness to them all,
      for the fortunes of Gerrard had changed greatly, and he was now in a fair
      way of becoming a prosperous man again. The numerous gold discoveries had
      brought a great inrush of diggers, and cattle for killing were now worth
      four times the price they had been a year before. He had built his new
      house, which was ready and actually furnished when his sister and Mary
      arrived at Somerset, where he had met them. Together they had ridden
      across the peninsula, through the dry, parched-up bush so lately
      devastated by fire, and when Ocho Rios was reached, the country was
      certainly looking at its worst, as he had mentioned in his letter. But
      since then glorious rains had fallen, and no one not acquainted with the
      marvellous changes produced by copious rains in a tropical land, would
      believe that the shady Leichhardt tree under which Gerrard and his sister
      were camped had four months previously been withered and scorched by the
      great fire which had swept across the peninsula.
    
    
      The name of "Ocho Rios" had been given to the station by the man who had
      first taken up the block of country for a cattle-run. He was an
      ex-Jamaican sugar planter, whose estate had been situated in the Ocho Rios
      (Eight Rivers) district of that beautiful island; and who had been ruined
      by the emancipation of the negroes in 1838. And, as his new possession was
      in the vicinity of eight small creeks flowing westward into the Gulf of
      Carpentaria, he had given it the same name.
    
    
      "How far are we from the sea now, Uncle Tom?" asked Mary, as she and Jim
      rode up leading the pack-horse.
    
    
      "About seven miles or so. Ever seen mango trees, Mary?"
    
    
      "No, Uncle Tom, but Aunt Lizzie has, and says that mangoes are lovely. She
      ate some at Point de Galle, when she was a little girl going to England.
      Didn't you, Aunt?"
    
    
      Mrs Westonley smiled, and looked at Gerrard inquiringly, wondering what
      had made him ask the question. He had a way of "springing" pleasant
      surprises upon people. When she came to the new bark-roofed house at Ocho
      Rios, she had never expected to find anything but the common chairs and
      tables, usually to be seen on cattle stations in the Far North. Certainly
      Tom had told her in his letter that he had bought "some decent furniture"
      at Port Denison, and she had smiled to herself, thinking of what the
      difference would be between her ideas and his of what was "decent
      furniture." And her heart had gone out to him when she       then knowing
      what she had not dreamt of before, that he was a ruined man       saw what
      he had bought for her out of his slender purse.
    
    
      "Tom," she had cried, "why did you go to such expense? And that piano too!
      I shall hardly have the heart to play upon it, knowing what              "
    
    
      "You are going to play to-night after dinner. That piano will become
      famous. It is the first thing of the kind ever seen on Cape York
      Peninsula. You should have seen the skipper of the pearling lugger at
      Somerset stare when he saw the thing swing out of the hold of the Gambier.
      It will be a great thing for you and Mary."
    
    
      "Indeed it will, Tom. For her sake alone I must rejoice."
    
    
      Four months after his return to the station Gerrard was delighted to
      receive a visit from Douglas Fraser and Kate. They, with Sam Young, and
      the rest of Fraser's old hands, were on one of the new rushes about ninety
      miles from Ocho Rios, and were, Fraser said, doing very well, together
      with some fifty other white diggers, and several hundreds of Chinese.
      Amongst other news the ex-judge told Gerrard something that had pleased
      him greatly.
    
    
      "You'll be glad to hear that Adlam is thoroughly recovered," he said, "I
      saw a paragraph about him in a Brisbane Courier, two months old,
      which the new sub-Inspector of Black Police gave me last week. The poor
      fellow had a most marvellous escape."
    
    
      Adlam had indeed had a marvellous escape from a dreadful death. When the
      treacherous "Snaky" Swires had heard the pop of the soda water in the
      purser's cabin, he had naturally concluded that Adlam had poured it into
      the glass containing the drugged brandy; but as a matter of fact Adlam had
      drunk the soda water alone, for he thought he had taken quite enough
      champagne       and other liquid refreshment as well       at the dinner
      to MacAlister, and wanted to rise earlier than usual in the morning with a
      clear head. When Pinkerton and Capel entered his cabin, he was not quite
      asleep, and had turned in his berth as he heard his door close softly, and
      the next instant the American had seized him by the throat, and the Jew
      dealt him a blow on the temple with a slung shot. After that he remembered
      nothing more. When Capel and Pinkerton dropped his unconscious figure down
      into the bunker, he had rolled down the inclined heap of coals to the
      bottom, where half an hour later he was discovered by the half-drunken
      coal trimmers, who at once summoned the chief engineer, and Adlam was
      carried to his cabin, Swires opening the door with the duplicate key he
      was allowed to possess. There was nothing in the cabin to give rise to any
      suspicion       everything was in the usual order; and it was naturally
      concluded that the purser had fallen down into the bunkers in the
      darkness, and had struck his head, or that a heavy piece of fallen coal
      had inflicted the terrible blow. No doctor was available, and for many
      days he hovered between life and death, unable to speak. It was only after
      the steamer arrived at Somerset that medical assistance was obtained, and
      that Captain MacAlister opened the safe, and found it rifled of all the
      cash it had contained       the bundle of unsigned notes Adlam had given
      to the bank manager within an hour after the steamer's arrival at
      Cooktown. Poor Adlam, still unconscious, was sent to Brisbane. The
      disappearance of Swires led to the belief that he was the perpetrator of
      the robbery, but Adlam, still unable to speak, could not give any
      information on the subject. Gerrard and Fraser, however, told the captain
      all they knew of Captain Forreste and his friends, and in due time they
      were arrested at one of the mining camps and brought back to Cooktown,
      charged with being concerned in the affair. But there was not a tittle of
      evidence against them, and they were discharged.
    
    
      Another matter which had pleased Gerrard was that he had heard that
      Randolph Aulain with a party of three, was working the head waters of the
      little creek running into the Batavia, on which both he and Gerrard had
      found gold, and that they had washed out some thousands of ounces. But
      Aulain's expectation of being able to secure the usual Government reward
      for the discovery of a payable and permanent gold-field was not realised;
      the Mining Warden had reported adversely upon it as regarded the latter
      essential qualification. Gerrard felt some surprise that Aulain had not
      come to see him, for the "place with a hunking big boulder standing in the
      middle of a deep pool," was only eighty miles from Ocho Rios. But then,
      upon second thoughts, he concluded that the auri sacra fames had
      seized his friend too thoroughly in its grip       as it always does the
      amateur digger, especially when he strikes upon very rich auriferous
      country, as was the case in this instance. And his surmise was correct,
      for Aulain was working madly to become rich and win Kate, and had no
      thought of aught else.
    
    
      "Here are the mangoes, Mary," said Gerrard, as two hours after leaving
      their camp under the great Leichhardt tree, the party drew rein before a
      grove of fifty or more of the beautiful trees; "these escaped the big
      fire. See, the clusters of fruit are almost ripe. In another week or so
      they will be fit to eat, and then you'll see all the winged insects and
      the 'bitiest' ants in the universe here in millions, feeding upon them.
      The niggers like them too. About four years ago a mob of myalls came here
      and stripped every tree, and I did not mind it very much. But two days
      after that, they killed and ate two of my stockmen, and Inspector Aulain
      gave them a terrible punishment."
    
    
      He stood up in his saddle, broke off a cluster of the reddening fruit, and
      tossed them to Jim. "Put them in your saddle pouch, Jim, and when we get
      home wrap them in a piece of damp blanket; they'll be ripe in a couple of
      days. Now, come on, Lizzie, we can ride along the beach for another five
      miles. I want to show you the old Dutch ship buried in the sand. Some day
      I mean to dig her out, and find millions of treasure       eh, Jim? Like
      the storybooks, you know."
    
    
      And then, as the first red glories of the nearing sunset spread its blades
      of softened fire upon the sleeping waters of the Gulf, they cantered along
      the hard, yellow sand.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXIV
    
    
      Summer had come and gone, and come again before Gerrard received a visit
      from Aulain. Early one scorching, hot morning, however, he rode up to the
      station, leading a pack-horse, and found his friend busy in the branding
      yard with Jim, and some white and aboriginal stockmen. Gerrard was
      delighted to see him, and at once ceased his work of branding calves.
    
    
      "Come to the house, Aulain. My sister will be so pleased to see you. Jim,
      take Mr Aulain's horses to the stable, give them a wash down, and then
      turn them out into the river bank paddock."
    
    
      "No, don't do that, Gerrard," said Aulain; "I can't stay for the night. I
      want to push on to       to"       he hesitated a moment,       "towards
      Black Bluff Creek."
    
    
      "Nonsense, man! It's ninety miles from here, and you can't get there
      before to-morrow night, although your horse looks pretty fit for another
      twenty miles or so. What is the earthly use of your camping out to-night?
      I'll take it very badly, I can tell you, and my sister will feel greatly
      hurt."
    
    
      The ex-inspector began to protest, but Gerrard would not listen, and so
      Aulain allowed himself to be overruled. As they walked to the house,
      Gerrard could not but notice that his friend seemed very much changed in
      his manner. He spoke slowly and constrainedly, and looked at least five
      years older than he was when Gerrard had last seen him at Port Denison.
    
    
      "Fever been troubling you again, Aulain?" he said sympathetically, as he
      placed his hand on his shoulder.
    
    
      Aulain gave a nod. "Oh, nothing very bad. I get a pretty stiff turn now
      and again, but there's nothing like hard work to shake it off when you
      feel it coming on."
    
    
      "Just so. How's the claim going       well, I hope?"
    
    
      "It's worked out now. But my three mates and I have done very well out of
      it. We have taken out four thousand five hundred ounces in a year and
      eight months. We sent the gold away by the escort last week, and our camp
      is broken up. My mates have gone off in various directions to other
      diggings."
    
    
      "And you?"
    
    
      "Oh, I thought I would see what the new field near Cape Grenville was
      like. I hear that it is very patchy, but any amount of rich pockets. And
      as Black Bluff Creek is on my way, I thought I would pay Fraser a visit,
      and see how he is doing. Do you know?"
    
    
      "Very well indeed."
    
    
      "Is he?" and Gerrard was quick to notice the gloomy look that came into
      Aulain's eyes, and wondered thereat.
    
    
      "I am so glad to meet you at last, Mr Aulain," said Mrs Westonley, as the
      two men entered the cool sitting-room. "Tom has a just grievance against
      you for not coming to see him when you were only eighty miles from us.
      Almost every day for the past year he has been expecting to see you. But I
      suppose that washing out gold is too fascinating a pursuit, and that you
      could not drag yourself away."
    
    
      Aulain smiled. "You are quite right in one way, Mrs Westonley, but wrong
      in another. I should have come to Ocho Rios six months ago, but all our
      horses died from eating poison bush, and it was only a few weeks ago that
      my mates and I were able to buy some from a drover, who was taking a mob
      down to Cooktown."
    
    
      During lunch the ex-inspector brightened up somewhat, and once smiled when
      Mrs Westonley, in alluding to the several visits made by Kate Fraser to
      Ocho Rios, said that Jim had fallen violently in love with her, whereupon
      the lad laughed, and said he was only as much in love with her as were
      Uncle Tom and Mary. Gerrard, who of course knew of Aulain's rejection by
      Kate, was at that moment wondering whether his friend meant to again "try
      his luck" or had quite got over the affair, and joined heartily in the
      general laugh that followed Jim's remark.
    
    
      "I think she is a delightful girl, Mr Aulain," said Mrs Westonley; "and I
      am looking forward to her next visit. She spent a fortnight with us the
      last time, and we felt quite dull and humdrum after she had gone home to
      her father."
    
    
      Aulain raised his brows slightly, and enquired if Miss Fraser had come all
      that distance alone. Surely she would not be so rash!
    
    
      "Oh, no! She knows how bad these Cape York blacks are, and would not be so
      reckless of her life as to come alone. Mr Fraser came with her the first
      time, then one of her father's mates was her next escort, and the last
      time Tom and Jim went to the Bluff for her, and also went back with her."
    
    
      A fleeting shadow crossed the dark handsome face, but beyond saying that
      the blacks were now not so bold as they were two years ago, he apparently
      did not take much interest in Miss Fraser's visits to Ocho Rios. But
      already his ever suspicious mind was at work about her and Gerrard.
    
    
      After lunch, as there was more branding to be done, Gerrard went back to
      the stockyard. Aulain wished to come and help.
    
    
      "Indeed you shall not, Aulain. I'll tell you what you ought to do. You
      were saying that you felt inclined for a sea bathe when you camped last
      night and heard the surf beating on the beach. Now, you and Jim go and
      have a jolly good swim in the surf. Jim will show you a place safe from
      sharks."
    
    
      "I can't resist that," said Aulain eagerly. It was just the very thing he
      wished       to have a talk with Jim. "But I know the place you mean,
      Gerrard. My troopers and I have often bathed there when I was in charge of
      the N.P. Camp at Red Beach."
    
    
      Jim ran off to catch and saddle a couple of horses, for although the
      bathing place was only three miles distant, no Australian would walk so
      far (except to catch a horse) when he could ride.
    
    
      "Take your fishing-line, Jim," said Mrs Westonley, when he returned
      leading the horses, "and catch some bream for supper. No, Mary, certainly
      not       you cannot go. No, not even to help Jim to catch and clean the
      fish. This is a terrible girl, Mr Aulain," and with a smile she drew Mary
      to her, "I know exactly what she wants to do       ride into the surf and
      get wet through."
    
    
      "Aunt, you are a wonder. However did you guess?" and Mary, now
      almost as tall as Jim, hugged Mrs Westonley's slender waist; "that's
      exactly what I did mean to do. But I also meant to catch fish as well."
    
    
      "Then you can 'catch' me some guinea-fowl eggs instead, to make egg and
      bread-crumb to fry the fish. Mr Aulain, do you know that Tom brought some
      guinea-fowl from Port Denison, and now we have hundreds of them? They are
      horrid things, though. Instead of laying in the fowl-house in an ordinary
      Christian fowl-like way, they go miles away, and of course the carpet
      snakes and iguanas, and kookaburras,{*} get most of the eggs and chicks       except
      those which Jim and Mary find."
    

     * Laughing jackasses.

    
      Aulain laughed as he swung his light, wiry figure into his saddle, and
      then he and Jim cantered off.
    
    
      A few hours later, as he and the lad were returning to the station, he lit
      his pipe and said:
    
    
      "So your aunt doesn't care about the beach, and the sea, and the old Dutch
      ship buried in the sand, eh, Jim?"
    
    
      "No, Mr Aulain. She says she cannot look at the sea without shuddering       it
      always makes her think of her father and mother, and the wreck of the Cassowary.
      But Uncle Tom and Miss Fraser like the beach, and always went there in
      preference to anywhere else when they went for a ride."
    
    
      Poor Jim, never for one moment imagining the cause of Aulain's interest in
      Miss Fraser's movements, was then led on by him to relate nearly
      everything that had occurred at the station during her last visit. "Was
      she fond of fishing?" Aulain asked. "Oh, yes, and so was Uncle Tom. They
      would go out nearly every day either to the beach for bream, or up one of
      the creeks for spotted mullet."
    
    
      Sometimes he (Jim) and Mary would go with them, and then it would be a
      regular all-day sort of fishing and shooting picnic Miss Fraser used to
      shoot too, and Uncle Tom was teaching her to shoot from the left shoulder
      as well as the right       like he could. Then he went on to say that next
      time Kate came to Ocho Rios she, Gerrard and Mary and himself were all
      going to Duyphen Point, where there was a small coco-nut grove.
    
    
      "It will be grand, won't it, Mr Aulain? You see we are going to take two
      pack-horses, and our guns and fishing-lines, and will camp there for three
      or four days and come back with a load of coco-nuts."
    
    
      "It ought to be splendid, Jim. When is it to be?"
    
    
      "In about a month. Miss Fraser is coming to stay with aunt for three whole
      months. Uncle Tom and I are going to Black Bluff Creek for her, if Mr
      Fraser can't spare the time to come with her. You see, it's ninety miles,
      and you can't do it in one day, because some of the country is very rough,
      and none of our horses have ever been shod. Look at this colt's hoofs,"
      and he pointed to them; "ain't they an awful size?       real 'soft
      country' hoofs, and no mistake."
    
    
      Aulain gave a short nod, and then became silent, scarcely noticing Jim's
      further remarks concerning such interesting subjects as kangarooing,
      alligator-shooting, the big tribe of cannibal niggers on the Coen River,
      who had killed and eaten sixteen Chinamen diggers, etc., etc.
    
    
      For the rest of the day he was, Gerrard and Mrs Westonley noticed, very
      restless, and the former observed with some surprise that he helped
      himself freely and frequently to the brandy; hitherto he had known him as
      a somewhat abstemious man in the matter of liquor.
    
    
      He left soon after daylight, declining Gerrard's pressing invitation to
      stay for breakfast on the ground of wishing to "do a good twenty miles
      before the cursed sun got too hot," and somehow the master of Ocho Rios
      was not sorry to say good-bye to him, for his manner seemed to have
      undergone a very great, and not pleasant change.
    
    
      "Take care of the niggers, Aulain," he said as they parted.
    
    
      The ex-officer smiled grimly, and he touched the Winchester carbine slung
      across his shoulder. Then leading his pack-horse, he rode away.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXV
    
    
      "Oh, men who have, or have had fever as badly as Aulain has, often act
      very queerly, Lizzie, so don't be too hard on him."
    
    
      "I know that, Tom. But at the same time there is something about him       those
      strange eyes of his       that made me afraid of him. When I told him last
      night that Kate Fraser was coming here on a long visit, he did not answer;
      his eyes were fixed on your face in such a strange, intense look that it
      made me feel quite 'creepy'."
    
    
      Gerrard laughed. "Were they? I didn't notice it."
    
    
      "No, of course not. You were too busy showing Jim how to unscrew the
      nipples of his gun, and perhaps did not even hear what I was saying."
    
    
      "Oh, I did. But I didn't make any comment, as I noticed that at supper,
      whenever you or I spoke of the Frasers, he answered in curt
      monosyllables."
    
    
      "Did you tell him she was coming here next month?"
    
    
      "No. I daresay I should have done so if I had thought of it."
    
    
      "Tom, I am not a female Lavater, but when I saw him looking at you like
      that, I disliked and distrusted him."
    
    
      "Poor Aulain! Why, Lizzie, he's one of the straightest fellows that ever
      lived, and I am sure he has a sincere regard for me. You must never take
      notice of the queer looks and actions of men who have had fever badly."
    
    
      "Tom! I'm a woman, and I know. He was thinking of Kate Fraser       and
      you. And he is suffering from another fever       the fever of violent
      jealousy."
    
    
      Gerrard looked up       they were at breakfast. "Well, if that is the
      case, it is a bad complication of diseases, and I am sorry for him. He has
      no earthly reason to be jealous of me."
    
    
      "He is jealous, Tom, 'deadly jealous,' as Jim would say, and I
      dislike him, dislike him intensely for it You have been so good to him,
      too."
    
    
      "Only keeping things quiet about Big Boulder Creek, as I promised him I
      should. And then, you see, Lizzie, his not getting the Government reward
      of five thousand pounds, as he thought he should, has been a big
      disappointment to him."
    
    
      Mrs Westonley rose, came over to him, and placed her two hands against his
      bronzed cheeks.
    
    
      "Thomas Gerrard, Esquire?"
    
    
      "Mrs Elizabeth Westonley!"
    
    
      "You are to marry Kate Fraser!"
    
    
      "Am I, old woman? You're a perfect jewel of a sister to find me such a
      charming wife. But you see there are one or two trifling formalities to be
      observed. First of all, I should have to ask her her views on the
      subject."
    
    
      "You ought to have done that a year ago."
    
    
      "And have met with a refusal like poor Forde and Aulain."
    
    
      "No, you would not have been refused. I know that much," was his
      sister's emphatic observation. "But you are letting the time go by, Tom.
      And I am sure she is wondering why you don't ask. I know that she loves
      you."
    
    
      "Do you really?" and he shook his head smilingly.
    
    
      "Yes, I do. I'm certain. And I know you are fond of her."
    
    
      "Been long in the clairvoyant business, Lizzie?"
    
    
      "Don't talk nonsense, Tom. I am very serious       and it would make me
      very happy. Ask her this time, Tom. You must       else you have no right
      to be with her so much. It is not fair to the girl."
    
    
      "We are very great friends, Lizzie. I like her better than any woman I
      have ever met. And I have sometimes thought       but anyway, I'm not in a
      position to ask her."
    
    
      "Nonsense! Your affairs are improving every day."
    
    
      Gerrard was silent for a minute, then he said:
    
    
      "I think Aulain means to try again."
    
    
      "I am sure of it. But he is wasting his time. High-spirited as she is, she
      is almost frightened of him. She told me so. She resented very much a
      letter she received from him in reply to hers telling him she could not
      marry him; and moreover she told me that even if she cared ever so much
      for a man, she would never marry a Roman Catholic."
    
    
      "I don't think she will ever marry, Lizzie, so it is no use my indulging
      in ridiculous visions; she is too much attached to her father to ever
      leave him. And you will always be mistress of Ocho Rios and master of Tom
      Gerrard."
    
    
      Mrs Westonley laughed, and pulled his short, dark-brown, pointed beard.
      "Silly man! I know better than that; and I know also that Douglas Fraser
      would be pleased to see Kate become Mrs Tom Gerrard, for he likes you
      immensely. Now, promise me you will ask her?"
    
    
      Gerrard rose and made his escape to the door, then he turned.
    
    
      "I'll think it over, you match-making creature," and then he went off to
      the stockyard, apparently unconcerned, but secretly delighted at what his
      sister had told him, and she smiled to herself, for she knew that when he
      spoke of thinking about a matter, he had already decided.
    
    
      Black Bluff Creek was a purely alluvial gold-field, and was in the very
      zenith of its prosperity when, towards sunset, Randolph Aulain looked down
      upon it from an ironstone ridge a mile distant from the workings. It had
      been given its name on account of a peculiar formation of black rock,
      which rose abruptly from the alluvial plain, and extended for nearly two
      miles along and almost parallel with the creek, from the bed of which so
      much gold was being won by two hundred diggers. The top of this wall of
      rock was covered with a dense scrub, and presented a smooth, even surface
      of green, which even in the driest seasons never lost its verdant
      appearance. Some of the diggers had cleared away portions of the scrub,
      and erected sun-shelters of bark, under which they slept when their day's
      toils were over, and enjoyed the cool night breeze       free from the
      miasmatic steam of the valley five hundred feet below. Almost on the verge
      of the steep-to wall of rock was a large and regularly built "humpy," in
      which Douglas Fraser and Kate lived. The ascent to the summit of the bluff
      was by a narrow path that had been found by Kate in one of the many clefts
      riven in the side of the black-faced cliff, and her father's mates had so
      improved it with pick and shovel that Aulain could discern it quite
      easily.
    
    
      As he walked his horse down into the camp, the diggers had just ceased
      work for the day, and with clay-stained and soddened garments were
      returning to their various tents or "humpies" of bark, all of them
      contentedly smoking, and ready for their usual supper of salt beef,
      damper, and tea. Many of the stalwart fellows recognised the ex-officer of
      Black Police, and bade him a pleasant "good evening, boss," and presently
      he was hailed by Sam Young, Cockney Smith, and others of Fraser's party.
      He dismounted and shook hands with Young, and asked him where was the
      "pub," as he intended to put up there for the night.
    
    
      Young protested against his going there. "There it is, Mr Aulain, over
      there," and he pointed to the bush public house, a low, bark-roofed
      structure on the edge of the creek; "but you can't stay there to-night
      It's Saturday, you see, and the boys will be there in force to-night, and
      you'll get no sleep. Besides, Mr Fraser would be real put out if you
      didn't go to him. He's just gone home. He and Miss Kate live up on the
      bluff."
    
    
      "I know. I'll go and see them after supper, but I'd rather camp down here
      for to-night."
    
    
      "Then come to our tent. There's plenty of room, and plenty of tucker, and
      any amount of grass along the creek for your horses."
    
    
      Aulain accepted the offer, and after unsaddling and turning out his
      horses, he was provided with a piece of soap, an alleged towel, and a
      bucket of water, and made a hasty wash in company with Young and his
      mates. Then came supper and the interchange of the usual mining news. Two
      years before, not one of his present companions would have addressed him
      without the prefix of "Mister"; but now he was one of themselves, a
      digger, and would himself have felt awkward and uncomfortable if any one
      of them had had the lack of manners and good sense to "Mister" him.
    
    
      Supper over he lit his pipe, and telling Young he would be back about ten
      and take a hand at euchre, he set out and took the mountain path to the
      summit of the bluff. It was a beautifully clear moonlight night       so
      clear that every leaf of the trees which stood on the more open sides of
      the rocky track showed out as if it were mid-day, and a bright sun was
      shining overhead.
    
    
      When he was within sight of Fraser's dwelling, he heard two shots above
      him, and then Kate speaking.
    
    
      "I've got four of the little villains, father."
    
    
      The sound of her voice thrilled him, and he hastened his steps. In a few
      minutes he saw Douglas Fraser, who was seated outside smoking his
      after-supper pipe.
    
    
      "How are you, Fraser?" he cried.
    
    
      The big man sprang to his feet, and came towards him with outstretched
      hand.
    
    
      "Aulain, by Jove! I am pleased to see you again. I saw some one
      leading a pack-horse coming into the camp below, but never dreamt it was
      you. Come inside. Kate will be here in a few minutes. We have a bit of
      garden close by, and the confounded bandicoots and paddymelons ravage it
      at nights, and she has just been knocking some over. She will be delighted
      to see you."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXVI
    
    
      Kate was not pleased to see Aulain, but did not show it; for she
      guessed why he had come, and could not but feel a little frightened. But
      after a little while she felt more at her ease, when he began to tell her
      father and herself of his mining experiences, and said laughingly that
      malarial fever was not half as bad as gold fever.
    
    
      "You see," he said, turning to Kate, "the one only takes possession of
      your body: the other takes your soul as well. The more gold you get, the
      more you want; and one does not feel that he has a corporeal existence at
      all when he turns up a fifty or sixty ounce nugget       as I did on three
      or four occasions. You feel as if you belonged to another       a more
      glorious world; and before you, you see the open, shining gates of the
      bright City of Fortune."
    
    
      The grizzled ex-judge laughed. "You have missed your vocation in life,
      Aulain. Man, you're a poet But I know the feeling, and so does Kate. Well,
      I am pleased that you have had such luck."
    
    
      "And so am I," said Kate incautiously, "and I wish you better luck still
      at the new rush at Cape Grenville; but I think what has pleased me most,
      Mr Aulain, is that you have left the Native Police. Do you know that when
      the escort was here a few weeks ago with ten black troopers, and your
      successor came here to see us, I could hardly be civil to him, although he
      was very nice, and gave us some very late newspapers       only two months
      old."
    
    
      "The Black Police are certainly your bêtes noire, Kate," said her
      father with a smile, as he pushed the bottle of whisky towards his guest.
    
    
      "They are, dad. They are very especial black beetles to me       beetles
      with Snider rifles and murderous tomahawks for shooting and cutting down
      women and children."
    
    
      Aulain's dark face flushed, and Kate reddened too, for she was sorry she
      had spoken so hastily. Then, to her relief, there sounded a sudden
      outburst of barking from Fraser's kangaroo dogs.
    
    
      "Oh, those horrid paddy melons and bandicoots at the garden again!" and
      she rose and seized her gun.
    
    
      "May I come and have a shot, too?" said Aulain.
    
    
      "Do. It is as clear as noon-day. Take father's gun, Mr Aulain. I have
      plenty of cartridges in my pocket."
    
    
      They stepped out together into the brilliant moonlight, and then Kate,
      driving the dogs away, led the way to the garden       a small cleared
      space enclosed with a brush fence. Peering over the top, the girl saw more
      than a dozen of the energetic little rodents busily engaged in their work
      of destruction. Indicating those at which she intended to fire, she
      motioned to Aulain to shoot at a group which were further away, and
      occupied in rooting up and devouring sweet potatoes. They fired together,
      and three or four of the creatures rolled over, dead. The rest scampered
      off.
    
    
      "They will come back in ten or fifteen minutes," said Kate; "shall we
      wait? See, there is a good place, under that silver leaf ironbark, where
      it is rather dark. There is a log seat there."
    
    
      Aulain eagerly assented. This would give him the opportunity to which he
      had been looking forward.
    
    
      As soon as they were seated he took Kate's gun from her hand, and leant it
      with his own against the bole of the tree.
    
    
      "Kate," he said, speaking very quickly, "I am glad to have this chance of
      speaking to you alone. I want to ask your forgiveness for that letter I
      wrote when              "
    
    
      "I did forgive you, long ago, Randolph. I was very, very angry when I read
      it, and I daresay you too were angry when you wrote such cruel things to
      me, but then"       and she smiled       "you have such a very hasty
      temper."
    
    
      He placed his hand on hers. "Only you can chasten it, Kate. And now you
      know why I have come to Black Bluff."
    
    
      "It is very good of you, Randolph, but, as I have said, I forgave you long
      ago, and I am sorry that you have come so far just to tell me that you are
      sorry for what occurred, although both father and I are sincerely glad to
      see you."
    
    
      "Ah, Kate! You don't understand what I mean. In asking for your
      forgiveness I ask for your love. I came here to ask you to be my wife."
    
    
      "Don't, please, Randolph," and she drew herself away from him. "I cannot
      marry you. I like you       I always liked you       but please do not say
      anything more."
    
    
      "Kate," and the man's voice shook, "you cared for me once. Forget my mad,
      angry letter, and              "
    
    
      "I have forgotten it. Did I not say so? But please do not again ask
      me to marry you. Come, let us go back to the house. You will only make me
      miserable       or else angry."
    
    
      "Why have you changed so towards me?" he asked quickly.
    
    
      "I have not changed in any way towards you," she answered emphatically
      with a slight accent of anger in her tones. "Please do not say anything
      more. Let us go in," and she rose.
    
    
      "Kate," he said pleadingly, and he placed his hand on her arm gently,
      "just listen to me for a minute. I love you. I will do all that a man can
      to make you happy. I have left the Native Police, and I am now fairly well
      off              "
    
    
      She made a swift gesture. "For your sake I am pleased       very pleased       that
      you have left the Police, and have made money. But, Randolph," and though
      she was frightened at the suppressed vehemence in his voice, and the
      almost fierce look of his dark, deep-set eyes, she smiled as she put her
      hand on his, "please don't think that       that       money, I mean       would
      make any difference to me. Come, let us go back to father. I am sure he
      wants you to play chess."
    
    
      Aulain's face terrified her. He had lost control of himself, and his hand
      closed around her wrist.
    
    
      "So you throw me over?" he said in almost savage tones.
    
    
      "'Throw you over'! How dare you say such a thing to me!" and she tore her
      hand away from him, and faced him with blazing anger in her eyes. "What
      have I ever said or done that you can speak to me like this?"
    
    
      "I know who has come between us              "
    
    
      "Between us! What do you mean?" she cried scornfully. "What has there ever
      been 'between us'? And who do you mean?"
    
    
      Aulian's face whitened with the anger of jealousy, and he gave full vent
      to the unreasoning passion which had now overmastered him.
    
    
      "I mean Gerrard."
    
    
      "Mr Gerrard       your friend?" she said slowly.
    
    
      "Yes," he replied with a sneer; "my dear friend Gerrard       the man who,
      professing to be my friend, has steadily undermined me in your regard ever
      since he first saw you."
    
    
      "Your mind is wandering, I fear," and the icy contempt with which she
      spoke brought his anger to white heat. "I shall stay here, no longer, Mr
      Aulain," and she stepped over to the tree, and took up her gun. Aulain was
      beside her in an instant.
    
    
      "Do you think I do not know?" he said thickly, and the gleam of passion in
      his eyes struck terror to her heart, "It was he who made you leave
      Fraser's Gully to come here, so as to be near him. At first I thought that
      it was that Scotch hound of a parson       but now I know better."
    
    
      Kate flushed deeply, then she whitened with anger. "Oh, I wish I were a
      man! I could strike you as it is! Ah, you should never have left the Black
      Police. I shall not fail to let the man who befriended you know how you
      have vilified him."
    
    
      "You need not. I will tell him myself what I have told you. By                      
      he shall suffer for robbing me of you!" and it needed all Kate's courage
      to look into his furious eyes.
    
    
      "Good-night, Mr Aulain," she said, trying to speak calmly; "I do not wish
      to       I hope I never may       see you again."
    
    
      "No doubt," was the sneering response. "Mr Thomas Gerrard, the squatter,
      is in a very different position from Randolph Aulain, the digger, with a
      paltry three or four thousand pounds."
    
    
      Kate set her teeth, and tried hard to choke a sob.
    
    
      "My father and I thought that you were a gentleman, Mr Aulain. I see now
      how very much we were mistaken. And as far as Mr Gerrard is concerned, he
      will know how to deal with you. I will ask my father to write to him
      to-morrow."
    
    
      "Why not expedite your proposed visit to him, and tell him personally?"
      said Aulain with a mocking laugh.
    
    
      Kate made no answer, but walked swiftly away. Five minutes later, Aulain,
      without going to the house to say good-bye to Douglas Fraser, descended
      the rocky path to the main camp.
    
    
      At daylight next morning, to the wonder of Sam Young and his mates, he was
      missing. He had risen at dawn, caught and saddled his horses, and gone off
      without a word of farewell.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXVII
    
    
      "Hansen's Rush" was one of the richest, noisiest, and the "rowdiest" of
      all the many newly-discovered fields, and contained more of the elements
      of villainy amongst its six hundred inhabitants than any other rush in the
      Australian Colonies. Perhaps about two-thirds of the men were genuine
      diggers, the rest were loafers, card-sharpers, horse and cattle thieves,
      sly grog-sellers, and men "wanted" by the police for various offences,
      from murder down to simple robbery with violence. So far, however, the arm
      of the law had not yet manifested its power at "Hansen's," although at
      first when the field was discovered by the prospector after whom it was
      named, a solitary white trooper and one native tracker had reached there,
      expecting to be reinforced. But one day he and the aboriginal rode out of
      camp to visit a party of diggers, who were working at the head of the
      creek, and never returned.
    
    
      Months afterwards, the body of the white man was found lying near a heap
      of huge boulders, and it was concluded that either the unfortunate trooper
      had been thrown from his horse and killed, or that he had been murdered by
      his black subordinate, for the latter was never seen again at the camp,
      and most of the diggers asserted that he had deserted to the coastal
      blacks, where he would be safe from capture. When the body was discovered
      a careful search was made for some gold which had been entrusted to the
      policeman, but it could not be found; and this confirmed the theory of the
      tracker being the murderer.
    
    
      Then, nearly three months after, "Moses," as the black tracker was named,
      walked into Somerset carrying his carbine and revolver, and told another
      story, which was accepted by the authorities as true. The party of miners
      whom he and the trooper visited, had complained of their tent having been
      entered when they were absent at their claim, and some hundreds of ounces
      of gold stolen. This was some weeks previously, and heavy rain, since
      then, had obliterated all traces of the robbers' tracks. The diggers, said
      Moses, then gave the trooper a bag of small nuggets containing about fifty
      ounces, and asked him to take it to Hansen's to await the monthly gold
      escort.
    
    
      That night he and Moses camped near the boulders, and at daylight the
      latter went after the horses, leaving the poor trooper asleep. Half an
      hour later, he heard the sound of a shot, and saw three mounted men
      galloping towards him. They halted when they saw him, and then all three
      fired at him, but missed. Then they tried to head him off       he was on
      foot       but he was too fleet, and after an hour's pursuit he gained
      some wild country in the ranges, where he was, he thought, safe. Feeling
      hungry as the morning went on, he penetrated a thick scrub in the hope of
      finding a scrub turkey's nest. He did find one, and whilst engaged in
      eating the eggs, was dealt a sudden blow from behind with a waddy, and
      when he became conscious, found he had been captured by a wandering tribe
      of mountain blacks. They did not treat him harshly, but kept a strict
      watch on him for two months. One wild night, however, securing his carbine
      and revolver, he managed to escape, and finally reached Somerset.
    
    
      "Hansen's," in addition to the several bark-roofed drinking shanties of
      bad reputation, also possessed a combined public house and general store,
      kept by a respectable old digger named Vale, who was doing a very thriving
      business, the "Roan Pack-Horse Hotel" being much favoured by the better
      class of men on the field. The loafers, rowdies, and such gentry did not
      like Vale, who had a way of throwing a man out if he became objectionably
      drunk and unduly offensive.
    
    
      One afternoon, about five, three men entered the "hotel" part of Vale's
      establishment, and entered what was termed "the parlour." They were very
      good customers of Vale's, although he did not much care about them, being
      somewhat suspicious as to their character and antecedents. The three men
      were Forreste, the Jew Barney Green, and Cheyne.
    
    
      The former had grown a thick beard, and looked what he professed to be       a
      digger pure and simple; and Green and Cheyne also had discarded the use of
      the razor, and in their rough miners' garb       flannel shirts, moleskin
      pants, and slouch felt hats       there was nothing to distinguish them
      from the ordinary run of diggers at Hansen's Rush. They had, Vale knew, a
      supposedly paying claim, but worked it in a very perfunctory manner, and
      employed two "wages men" to do most of the pick and shovel work. Their
      esteemed American confrère was not with them this afternoon       one
      of them always remained about their claim and tent on some excuse, for it
      contained many little articles which, had they been discovered by the
      respectable diggers at Hansen's, would have led to their taking a very
      hurried departure from the field.
    
    
      "What's it to be?" said Vale, coming to the door of the room.
    
    
      "Oh, a bottle of Kinahan," said Forreste, tossing the price of it       a
      sovereign       upon the table. "Got any salt beef to spare?"
    
    
      "Not a bite. Wish I had. But that mob of cattle can't be far off now. They
      were camped at the Green Swamp two nights ago. There's a hundred head       all
      fine, prime young cattle, I hear."
    
    
      "Are you buying the lot?"
    
    
      "Every hoof       at ten pound a head. Plenty of fresh beef then       at
      two bob a pound. No charge for hoofs, horns, and the end of the tail," and
      with this pleasantry, the landlord of the "Roan Pack-Horse" withdrew, to
      bring the whisky.
    
    
      A step sounded outside, and Randolph Aulain entered and nodded to the
      three men. He had been at Hansen's for some months, and had one of the
      richest "pocket" claims on the field, but most of the gold it produced
      went in gambling. He had made the acquaintance of Forreste and his gang,
      and in a way had become intimate with them, although he was pretty certain
      of their character. But he did not care.
    
    
      "Have a drink, Aulain?" said Barney Green.
    
    
      Aulain nodded, and sat down, and then a pack of cards was produced, and
      the four men began to play       Aulain as recklessly as usual, and
      drinking frequently, as was now habitual with him.
    
    
      Night had fallen, and the diggers' camp fires were everywhere blazing
      among tents and humpies, as the ex-officer and his villainous
      acquaintances still sat at their cards, too intent upon the game to think
      of supper. Vale's black boy, however, brought them in some tea, damper,
      and a tin of preserved meat, and they made a hurried meal. Just as they
      had begun to play afresh, they heard a horseman draw up outside, and a
      voice say "Good-evening, boss," to Vale.
    
    
      All four men knew that voice, and Aulain's dark face set, as turning down
      his cards, he held up his hand for silence.
    
    
      "I'm Gerrard from Ocho Rios," went on the voice as the rider dismounted,
      and, giving his horse to the black boy, followed Vale into the combined
      bar and store. "I've camped the cattle five miles from here, and pushed on
      to let you know. Can you take delivery tomorrow morning pretty early, as I
      want to get down to the coast again as soon as I can?"
    
    
      "You bet!" said Vale with a laugh; "I'm all ready, and so is the money       not
      in cash, but in nuggets at four pounds the ounce. Is that right?"
    
    
      "Quite," was the answer, and then the four listeners heard Vale drawing
      the cork of a bottle of beer       a rare commodity at Hansen's Rush.
      "Come round here, Mr Gerrard, and sit down. There's another room, but just
      now there are four chaps gaffing there, and so if you don't mind we'll sit
      here, and talk until my nigger gets you some supper." Then they began to
      talk about the cattle, Vale frankly telling Gerrard that if he had asked
      another five pounds per head, he would have paid it, as the diggers had
      had no fresh meat for nearly five months.
    
    
      "Well, I've been very lucky," said Gerrard, and Forreste saw Aulain's
      teeth set, and wondered. "We       three black boys and myself       started
      out from the station with a hundred and ten head, and have not lost a
      single beast       no niggers, no alligators, no poison bush, nothing of
      any kind to worry us for the whole two hundred miles."
    
    
      "I'll give him something to worry over before long," said Green viciously
      to Forreste.
    
    
      "And so shall I," said Aulain in a savage whisper.
    
    
      "Do you know him?" asked Forreste eagerly.
    
    
      Aulain replied with a curt nod, and then again held up his hand for
      silence.
    
    
      "Curse you, keep quiet; I want to hear what he is saying."
    
    
      "Well, I'm glad to see you, Mr Gerrard," went on Vale. "I've heard a lot
      about you, and was sorry to hear of your loss in the big fire. I wish you
      luck."
    
    
      "Thank you, Mr Vale. And I'm glad to meet you, and sell you my cattle.
      Every one that I have heard speak of you says that you will never try to
      'skin' a digger over the price of his liquor and 'tucker.'"
    
    
      Vale was pleased. For a bush publican and store-keeper he had an unusual
      reputation for honesty       and well deserved it, for all his roughness
      and lurid language when aroused to wrath. He asked Gerrard to stay for the
      night.
    
    
      "No, I cannot. I must get back to the cattle to-night, and do my watch.
      But I think I shall spell here at Hansen's for a day or two, have a look
      at the field, and see if I can buy a share in one of the claims. As I'm
      getting my money out of the diggings I ought to put something back, even
      if I strike a rank duffer."
    
    
      "Ah, you're one of the right sort of men, Mr Gerrard. I daresay I can put
      you on to something that won't displease you in the end. But I'm sorry you
      can't camp here to-night."
    
    
      "No, I must not. It would not be fair to my men to leave them with a mob
      of cattle out in the open all night in such thunder-stormy weather. If
      they broke away they would clear off into the ranges."
    
    
      Then he added that whilst two of his black stockmen were returning to Ocho
      Rios after they had had a spell at "Hansen's," he was striking across
      country to the coast       seventy miles distant       to the mouth of the
      Coen River.
    
    
      "You see, Mr Vale, my luck is coming in, 'hand over fist,' as the sailors
      say. I'm going to be married at Ocho Rios next month by the Gold
      Commissioner, and there is a pearling lugger bringing me a lot of stores
      round from Somerset, and I have arranged to meet her at the Coen on the
      22nd, and sail round in her. I'm taking one black boy with me, who will
      take my horse back with him to the station, and I'll get the benefit of a
      short sea-trip of a few days, or perhaps a week."
    
    
      Vale opened another bottle of beer       more valued at Hansen's than even
      whisky at a sovereign a bottle.
    
    
      "Here's to your very good fortune and happiness, Mr Gerrard! Will you mind
      my mentioning it to the boys here to-night? You see, I arranged to give a
      sort of a shivoo as soon as the cattle got here, and I had killed and
      dressed a couple of beasts."
    
    
      Gerrard laughed. "I don't mind. And I'll come to the shivoo myself, and
      eat some of my own beef. Now, I must be getting back to the cattle."
    
    
      Aulain and the other three men waited until they heard his horse brought.
      And then the dark-faced ex-inspector turned to Forreste.
    
    
      "Come outside. I want to talk to you."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    
    
      The news that a small mob of cattle had been bought by Vale, and were to
      arrive on the following day, caused great satisfaction to the diggers, and
      that night the "Roan Pack-Horse" was crowded with diggers, who had not for
      many months tasted meat of any kind, except now and then a scrub wallaby.
      Game of any kind was scarce, and hard to shoot, and the diggers, although
      they cheerfully paid adventurous packers three shillings for a small tin
      of sardines, and five for a tin of American salmon, wanted beef of some
      kind       even if it were that of a worn-out working bullock       if
      such a treasure could have been found. Vale, for business and other
      purposes, had carefully avoided telling any one until the last moment that
      he had sent a letter to Gerrard, offering him ten pounds per head for one
      or two hundred young cattle, delivered to him in fair condition. A "cute"
      man of business, he had the idea of forming the nucleus of a herd with
      which to stock some adjacent country to "Hansen's Rush," and being also in
      his rough way a sentimentalist, he meant to give the diggers a surprise       for
      a satisfactory quid pro quo. He would sell them fresh beef at two
      shillings a pound, when they were willing to pay double, instead of eating
      "tinned dog," as they termed the New Zealand and American canned beef and
      mutton they bought from the packers at exorbitant prices, and often cast
      aside with disgust and much vivid language.
    
    
      At nine o'clock on the following morning, Gerrard and his three black
      stockmen appeared, driving before them the mob of young cattle       steers,
      young heifers, and a few bulls; and the diggers gave him an uproarious
      welcome, for work on the claims had been stopped for that day at least,
      and they had been waiting for him.
    
    
      "Good morning, boys," cried Gerrard, as the mob of cattle was rounded up
      by his black stockmen, and he, swinging his right foot up out of the
      stirrup, sat sideways on his saddle. "Just show me those you want for
      killing, Vale, and I'll cut them out for you right away. Then I'll turn
      the rest over to you to tail.{*} I've had enough of 'em, and want a
      drink."
    

     * "Tail"       a drover or stockman who is set to keep a mob of
     cattle from straying "tails" them       i.e., follows at their
     tails.

    
      "Here you are, Mr Gerrard," cried a big, hairy-faced digger, who was
      holding a bottle of beer in one hand, and a tin pannikin in the other; "a
      bottle of genuine Tennant's India Ale, acceptable to the most tender
      stomach, and recommended by the faculty for nuns, nurses, bullock drivers,
      and other delicate persons."
    
    
      The crowd laughed, and then Gerrard, after satisfying his thirst, "cut
      out" (separated from the rest of the mob) three fat steers indicated by
      Vale; they were at once taken to the killing yard, and the remainder of
      the animals driven down to the creek to drink, and Gerrard's
      responsibility ceased.
    
    
      Amongst those who watched the arrival of the cattle were Aulain and
      Forreste. They were on the outskirts of the crowd, leaning against the
      rough "chock and dog leg" fence which served to enclose an acre or so of
      ground used as a horse-paddock by the diggers. Early in the day as it was,
      Aulain's sallow face was flushed from drinking. He and Forreste had come
      to an understanding the previous night. The gentlemanly "Captain" did not
      take long to discover the cause of Aulain's hatred of Gerrard, and he
      inflamed it still further by telling him a well-connected series of lies
      about his frequently having seen Kate Fraser clasped in Gerrard's arms on
      the deck of the Gambier, when they imagined that they were
      unobserved, and Aulain, who was now hardly sane, believed him implicitly.
    
    
      "Let me deal with him first," he had said; "you can have your turn after I
      have finished with him."
    
    
      "You don't mean to kill him?" asked Forreste; "if you do, I'm out of it I
      have a score to settle with him, but not in that way."
    
    
      "Settle it in any way you like," said Aulain savagely, "but don't
      interfere with me. I'm not going to kill him, but I am going to make him
      suffer for his treachery to me. But," and he turned to Forreste with a
      sneer, "you seem very diffident in the matter of killing any one just now.
      Perhaps you and your friends acted rather impulsively in the matter of
      Trooper Angus Irving."
    
    
      "What do you mean?" cried Forreste hoarsely, and his face blanched with
      mingled rage and terror.
    
    
      "I have not been five years in the Native Police without gaining some
      experience. And when you and your friends galloped after the black
      tracker, one of your number lost his moleskin saddle-cloth, did he not?"
    
    
      Forreste made no answer, though his lips moved.
    
    
      "I found that saddle-cloth two months ago, and recognised it as
      belonging to your mate Cheyne, for he once lent it to me. It was a great
      mistake of his to gallop over rough country with loose girths       especially
      upon such an occasion as that. Fifty ounces of gold was not worth it."
    
    
      Forreste, a coward at heart, collapsed. "We could not help it We were
      trying to unbuckle his valise from his saddle when he awoke, and              
    
    
      "And       I understand. So please say no more of what followed. It does
      not concern me, and you need not look so ghastly white."
    
    
      Then he walked away to his tent, for he did not wish to be seen by Gerrard       at
      that time.
    
    
      But a few hours later the latter learnt quite accidentally from Vale that
      his one-time friend was at Hansen's, and had been one of the card-playing
      party of the previous night Vale was speaking of the great yields from
      some of the claims on the field, and mentioned that "Aulain, who had been
      in the Nigger Police," had a pretty rich one. Gerrard was surprised to
      hear of his being at Hansen's, for he and the Frasers thought he had gone
      to the new rush at Cape Grenville on the east coast. Of her quarrel with
      him Kate had told Gerrard but little, but her father had given him the
      story in detail, and it had angered him greatly.
    
    
      "Would you care to go over to his claim, and have a yarn with him?" said
      Vale; "it's only about a mile away. I think he wants to sell out."
    
    
      "No, I don't want to see him. I know him very well, and he was once a
      great friend of mine, but he is not now, and I don't think it would be
      advisable for us to meet. He nurses an imaginary grievance against me."
    
    
      Vale nodded. "He's a queer fellow, and I am sure he's not quite right in
      the upper story. Sometimes he won't speak to a soul for a week at a time;
      then he has a drinking bout, and goes off his head entirely. I feel sorry
      for him, for it is a pity to see a gentleman come down so low, and
      associate with spielers and card-sharpers. The men he was playing with
      last night are a shady lot       a man called Forreste, and his mates
      Cheyne and Capel              "
    
    
      "Ha!" cried Gerrard, "so that gang is here? I know a good deal about them,"
      and he told Vale of what had occurred on board the Gambier when
      Fraser had thrown Capel across the deck.
    
    
      "I thought they were a fishy crowd, and there are lots of men here who
      believe they are gold-stealers, but so far they have been too clever and
      have escaped detection."
    
    
      "Well, I can tell you that Capel, otherwise Barney Green, is one of the
      most notorious gold thieves in Australia, and served a sentence in New
      South Wales."
    
    
      "Can I make that known?"
    
    
      "Certainly. It should be known. You can call upon me to repeat what I have
      told you to the whole camp."
    
    
      "Very well, but not to-day. They'll be sure to be here to-night at the
      shivoo, and as some of the boys are certain to be pretty groggy they might
      half-kill the whole gang. But I'll go for them in the morning, if you'll
      back me up."
    
    
      "Of course I will. But I don't think they will show up to-night, if they
      know I am here."
    
    
      In this surmise Gerrard was correct, for Forreste and his companions kept
      away, being particularly anxious not to come into personal contact with
      him, and in pursuance of a plan of their own. After the cattle had been
      killed, they sent a neighbouring digger to buy some beef, and remained at
      their claim for the rest of the day. Forreste, however, went to several of
      the other claims, and told the owners that he and his mates thought of
      clearing out in a day or so, and would sell their claim cheap.
    
    
      In an hour or two he came back, and found Cheyne outside the tent,
      repairing their saddles. Green and Pinkerton were busy at the claim,
      cradling the last of the wash-dirt taken out.
    
    
      "What luck?" asked Cheyne.
    
    
      "Better than I expected. Old Sandy MacParland and his party are coming
      here to-morrow morning, and are going to give the claim a day's trial. If
      they like it, they will buy us out for one hundred pounds."
    
    
      "Pity we haven't got time to salt it,{*} and get a bigger price."
    

     * "Salting" a gold mine is a common practice of dishonest
     miners not entirely unknown even to magnates of the Stock
     Exchange       as the records of the London Law Courts have shown
     for many years past.

    
      "MacFarland is too old a hand to be got at that way," replied the captain,
      as he walked on to the claim to tell Green and Pinkerton his news.
    
    
      "We can get away to-morrow evening before sunset," he said, after he had
      told them the result of his negotiations with MacParland. "Cheyne says we
      can camp at Leichhardt Ponds that night, push on early in the morning, and
      wait for our man at Rocky Waterholes, where he is sure to camp for the
      night."
    
    
      "He'll want a good rest if Aulain does him up to-night," said Capel with
      an evil grin.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXIX
    
    
      Nearly a hundred noisy but contented diggers filled Vale's hotel and
      store, all talking at once; and outside in the yard, seated on boxes,
      barrels, etc., were as many more, equally as well satisfied as those
      within. The impromptu and "free feed" of freshly-killed beef had been a
      great success, and now at seven o'clock, what Vale called "the harmony"
      began       to wit, music from a battered cornet, an asthmatic accordion,
      and a weird violin. There were, however, plenty of good singing voices in
      the company, and presently a big, fat-faced American negro, with a rich
      fruity voice, struck up a well-known mining song, "The Windlasses," and
      the diggers thundered out the chorus:
    
    
      "For I love the sound of the windlasses, And the cry, 'Look-out, below.'"
    
    
      At its conclusion there was much applause, and then the negro, who was an
      ex-sailor, was pressed, very literally, for another song. One digger
      gripped him around the waist, and another seized his woolly poll and shook
      him.
    
    
      "Sing, you beggar, sing! Give us the 'Arctic Fleet.'"
    
    
      "Don' you be so familiar, sah! You common digger pusson! How dah you take
      liberties with a gentleman!" and the negro laughed good-naturedly as he
      was forced on his feet again. "And don' se singist get some refreshment
      fust?"
    
    
      It was at once supplied, and then "Black Pete's" rich tones sounded out in
      their full strength as he began the whaleman's ditty:
    

     "Oh, its advertised in Noo York town,
     Likewise in Alban-ee,
     For five hunder and fifty Yankee boys,
     To join de whaling fleet

          Singing, blow ye windy mornin's,
          And blow ye winds, heigho,
          Clear away de marnin' dews,
          To de Arctic we mus' go,
          To de Arctic we mus' go."

    
      The song was a lengthy one, and when it was finished, there was a pause;
      then some digger called out through the cloud of tobacco smoke that filled
      the room:
    
    
      "Won't you give us a song, Mr Gerrard?" Gerrard, who was talking to Vale,
      and some other men, turned and shook his head smilingly, when suddenly
      there was a slight commotion near the open door, and Randolph Aulain
      pushed through the crowd into the centre of the room. He was booted and
      spurred, and carried a short, heavy whip of plaited greenhide.
    
    
      "I should like to have a few words with you, Mr Gerrard, before you sing."
    
    
      In an instant there was a dead silence       the diggers saw that Aulain
      meant mischief, for his usually sallow features were now white with
      ill-concealed fury. Gerrard kept his seat, but leant back a little so as
      to look Aulain full in the face.
    
    
      "I am not going to sing," he said quietly. "If you have anything to say to
      me, say it."
    
    
      "This filthy den is somewhat too crowded for a private discussion       unless
      you wish to let every one here know what you are. Come outside."
    
    
      "You want me to fight you, Aulain, do you?" The steady, unmoved tone of
      his voice sounded clearly through the crowded room.
    
    
      "Yes, you treacherous hound, I do. I'll make you fight."
    
    
      "You shall not. I do not fight with lunatics       and you speak and act
      like one. Come here to-morrow morning       or I will come to you if you
      wish."
    
    
      Vale put his hand on Aulain's arm, with rough good-humour. "Get back to
      your tent, my lad, or sit down and keep quiet This is my house. You can
      see Mr Gerrard in the morning. I'll engage he won't run away."
    
    
      Aulain thrust him aside with savage determination, and again faced
      Gerrard. "Are you coming outside?" he asked hoarsely.
    
    
      "No, I am not. But don't try my patience too long, Aulain."
    
    
      "Will you come or not?" he almost shouted, and he drew back a step, amidst
      a hot, expectant silence.
    
    
      "No, you are not in a condition to speak to any one, let alone fighting,"
      was the contemptuous answer.
    
    
      "Then take that, you wretched cur!" and he swung his heavy whip across
      Gerrards face, cutting the flesh open from temple to chin, and sending him
      down upon the earth floor.
    
    
      In an instant the maddened man was seized by Vale and another man, and
      borne to the ground. Then amidst oaths and curses, he was dragged outside,
      struggling like a demon, and carried to his horse, which was tied up to
      the fence. He was hoisted up into the saddle, and at once tried to take
      his pistol from its pouch, but the diggers took it away, and then seized
      his Winchester carbine.
    
    
      "Here, take your reins, you murderous dog!" cried Vale, putting them into
      his hands.
    
    
      "Stand back, boys, and well start him off to blazes."
    
    
      "He has a Derringer inside his shirt," cried one of the men, "I've seen
      it."
    
    
      "Let him keep it," and Vale raised the whip which he had torn from
      Aulain's hand, and gave the horse a stinging cut on the flank, and with a
      snort of pain and terror the animal leapt forward into the darkness.
    
    
      Never again was Randolph Aulain seen alive, but weeks afterwards his horse
      wandered back to Hansen's Rush, and began to graze outside his master's
      tent. And all that was left of Aulain was found long after in a gully in
      the ranges, with a rusted Derringer pistol lying beside some bleaching
      bones.
    
    
      Gerrard had a great send-off when he left Hansen's for the coast. The
      terrible cut on his face had been sewn up by a digger known as "Pat
      O'Shea," who, ten years before, had had on his brass door-plate in Merrion
      Square, Dublin, the inscription, "Mr Vernon O'Shea, M.R.C.S."
    
    
      "Take care of yourself, boss," cried Vale, as Gerrard swung himself up
      into the saddle, and made a grimace intended for a smile as he waved his
      hand to the assembled diggers, and trotted off, followed by his black boy,
      a short, wiry-framed aboriginal from the Burdekin River country, who was
      much attached to his master, and eyed his bound-up face with much concern.
      He, like Gerrard, carried a revolver at his saddle-bow, and a Snider
      carbine in a becket       Native Police fashion. Gerrard, in addition to
      his revolver, had a 44° Winchester carbine slung across his shoulder.
    
    
      "Well, Tommy, here we are off home again. How do you feel? Drunk last
      night?"
    
    
      "Yes, boss. Last night and night before, too. Mine had it fine time longa
      Hansen's."
    
    
      Gerrard laughed, and began to fill his pipe, though smoking just then gave
      him as much pain as pleasure. Then he and Tommy rode on in silence for
      many hours, until they came to where the beaten track ended at a lagoon,
      known as Leichhardt Ponds. Here they noticed that a party had been camped
      the previous night, and had evidently been shooting and eating duck, for
      the ground was strewn with feathers.
    
    
      From Leichhardt Ponds there was not even a blazed tree line, but both he
      and the black boy kept steadily on, their bushmen's knowledge guiding them
      in a bee line for the particular part of the coast they wished to reach.
    
    
      As they rode along, Tommy's eyes scanned the ground, which was strewn with
      a thick carpet of dead leaves and bark from the forest gum trees.
    
    
      "Four fellow men been come along here yesterday, boss," he said, as he
      pulled up and pointed downward.
    
    
      Gerrard bent over in his saddle, and looked at the tracks indicated by
      Tommy.
    
    
      "Some fellow stray horse perhaps, Tommy?"
    
    
      The black boy grunted a disapproval of the suggestion. No horses would
      stray so far from Hansen's, where there was good grass country, into
      "stunted ironbark" country where there was none. And presently to prove
      his contention, he pulled up and pointed to a small white object on the
      ground.
    
    
      "Look, boss. Some fellow been light pipe and throw away match."
    
    
      In an instant Gerrard's suspicions were aroused. What could a party of
      four men be doing so far away from Hansen's       and making towards the
      coast? Vale had told him that there were scores of notoriously bad
      characters on the field, and that it was known that he (Vale) was paying
      him for the cattle in gold, and had advised him to keep a sharp look-out
      for any strangers.
    
    
      For another two hours he and the black boy saw the tracks still going in
      the same direction, till open country was reached       a wide plain
      covered with clay pans. Here the tracks turned off sharply to the right,
      and Gerrard pulled up.
    
    
      "Which way Frenchman's Cap, Tommy?"
    
    
      Tommy pointed to the right.
    
    
      Frenchman's Cap was a small mining camp, sixty miles distant, and Gerrard
      was satisfied that the four horsemen were diggers, bound for that spot,
      and Tommy agreed with him.
    
    
      But he was wofully mistaken in his conclusions.
    
    
      Cheyne was one of the cleverest bushmen in Australia, and when Forreste
      and his party reached this spot, they too had stopped, at Cheyne's
      bidding.
    
    
      "Gerrard has a nigger with him who most likely will see our tracks. If we
      turn off here, and cross the clay pans, he will think we are going to
      Frenchman's Cap. It will mean us making a half circle of sixteen miles,
      but we will get to Rocky Waterholes a long way ahead of him."
    
    
      "How do you know he'll camp there?" asked Forreste.
    
    
      "He's sure too, even if only for an hour or two to spell his horses, and
      we'll get him as easy as falling off a log."
    
    
      Forreste moved uneasily in his saddle. He knew what "get him" meant Barney
      Green turned on him, and savagely asked if he was "funking" again.
    
    
      "No," was the sullen reply, "I'm not. I've given my promise, and I'll keep
      it. But you must remember that the policeman's tracker got away from us,
      and Gerrard's nigger may do the same."
    
    
      "I'll see to that," said Pinkerton. "If there is one thing that I can't
      miss when I shoot, it's a nigger. If I had been with you that day, I guess
      that that tracker wouldn't have got away."
    
    
      The plan they had arranged was a very simple one. The Rocky Waterholes
      were deep pools situated in the centre of a cluster of wildly confused and
      lofty granite boulders and pillars, covered with vines and creepers and
      broken up by narrow gullies. Cheyne knew the place, and knew almost to a
      certainty the particular spot at which Gerrard would camp, either for a
      few hours or for the night. It was in an open grassy space, almost
      surrounded by giant boulders. It was their intention, after disposing of
      Gerrard and the black boy, and securing the gold, to strike across country
      for Somerset, and there await a steamer bound for either London or
      Hongkong. At that place, where the steamers only remained for an hour or
      two, they would attract no more than the casual notice taken of lucky
      diggers; at Townsville or Port Denison they might be recognised. Already
      they had nearly a thousand ounces of gold between them       some little
      of it honestly earned from their own claim at Hansen's, but most of it
      gained by robbery; and with the two thousand pounds' worth that they knew
      were in Gerrard's possession, they calculated that they might leave the
      hardships of mining life, and enjoy themselves for a considerable time in
      England or America       without, however, the society of "Snaky" Swires,
      who had left them at Cooktown, fearful of being arrested in connection
      with the robbery on the Gambier.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXX
    
    
      "What a lovely spot!" thought Gerrard, as he caught sight of the Rocky
      Waterholes, whose calm, placid surfaces were gleaming like burnished
      silver under the rays of the sinking sun.
    
    
      It was indeed a beautiful scene, for the five pools were surrounded by
      noble Leichhardt and wattle trees, the latter all in the full glory of
      their golden flowers, the sweet perfume of which scented the air for miles
      around. Close in to the bank of the largest pool were a number of teal
      feeding on the green weed, and chasing each other over the shining water.
      As they caught sight of the intruders, they rose with a whir and
      disappeared, followed a few seconds later by a pair of snow-white cranes,
      which, however, merely flew noiselessly upward, and settled on the
      branches of a Leichhardt.
    
    
      The day had been intensely hot, and now, as the sun sank, there was
      presage of a thunderstorm, and Gerrard and Tommy quickly unsaddled,
      hobbled, and turned out the horses to feed upon the thick buffalo grass
      that grew in profusion around the bases of the vine-clad rocks which
      overlooked the pools. Then they hurriedly collected some dead wood for
      their camp fire, and threw it, together with their saddles, blankets,
      etc., under an overhanging ledge which would afford them complete shelter
      from the coming downpour.
    
    
      A fire was soon lit, and whilst Tommy attended to making the tea, his
      master unrolled his own blanket and spread it out; then, from mere force
      of habit, he took his revolver from his saddle and strapped it to his
      belt, placed his Winchester and Tommy's Snider against the side of the
      rock, where they would be within easy reach, and then told the black boy
      that he was going to have a bathe before supper.
    
    
      "No, no, boss!" cried Tommy, energetically, "baal you bogey longa that
      waterhole. Plenty fellow blue water snake sit down there       plenty. One
      bite you little bit, you go bung quick. Plenty fellow myall go bung longa
      baigan."{*}
    

     * "Do not bathe in that waterhole. Many blue water-snakes
     live in it. If one bit you, even a little, you would die
     quickly.    Many wild blacks have been killed by the baigan"

    
      Gerrard could not repress a shudder. He had often seen the dreaded
      "baigan"       a bright blue snake which frequented waterholes and
      lagoons, and whose venom equalled that of the deadly fer-de-lance of
      Martinique and St Vincent. Years before he had seen a cattle dog swimming
      in a lagoon attacked by a "baigan," which bit it on the lip, and, although
      a stockman, as soon as the animal was out of the water, cut out a circular
      piece of the lip, it died in a few minutes.
    
    
      "Very well, Tommy. I'll wait till after supper and have a bogey in the
      rain."
    
    
      As he spoke, the low rumble of thunder sounded, and deepened and deepened
      until it culminated in a mighty clap that seemed to shake the foundations
      of the earth, then followed peal after peal, and soon the rain descended
      in torrents, beating the waters of the pools into froth, and making a
      noise as of surf surging upon a pebbly beach.
    
    
      For twenty minutes the downpour held; then it ceased suddenly, and, like
      magic, a few stars appeared. The fire was now blazing merrily in the cave.
      Tommy had made the two quart pots of tea, and Gerrard was taking the beef
      and damper out of his saddle-bag when the black boy started.
    
    
      "What is it, Tommy?"
    
    
      "Horse neigh!"
    
    
      Gerrard listened. The boy was right, for he, too, heard a second neigh,
      and their own horses, which they could see standing quietly under a big
      Leichhardt tree, undisturbed by the storm, pricked up their ears and
      raised their heads.
    
    
      "Quick, take your rifle, Tommy!" and Gerrard seized his own, then taking
      up the two quart pots of tea, he threw the contents over the fire, and
      partly extinguished it       not a moment too soon, for almost at the same
      moment a volley rang out, and he knew he was hit; and Tommy also cried out
      that he was shot in the face. Seizing him by the hand, Gerrard dragged him
      outside, stooping low, and bullet after bullet struck the wall of the
      cave. As he and the black boy threw themselves flat on the ground a few
      yards away, they both saw the flashes of rifles less than a hundred yards
      distant, and knew by the sound of and the rapidity of the firing that
      their unseen foes were using Winchesters.
    
    
      "Keep still, Tommy, don't fire. Wait, wait!" said Gerrard in an excited
      whisper. "Let them go on firing into the cave. Can you make out where they
      are?"
    
    
      Pressing his hand to his cheek, which had been cut open by a bullet, the
      black boy watched the flashes.
    
    
      "Yes, boss, I see him       four fellow altogether. You look longa top
      flat rock, they all lie down close together."
    
    
      But keen as was his sight, Gerrard could see nothing but the flat moss and
      vine-covered summit of a huge granite boulder, from which the flashes
      came. Presently a bullet struck a piece of wood on the still smouldering
      fire, and scattered the glowing coals, then the firing ceased, and they
      heard voices.
    
    
      "Keep quiet, Tommy. Don't move, for God's sake, or they'll see us. They
      are reloading. They think they have killed us. Is your Snider all right?"
    
    
      "Yes, boss," was the whispered and eager reply, "rible and rewolber too."
    
    
      "Are you much hurt, Tommy?"
    
    
      "Only longa face, boss."
    
    
      "And I'm hit too, Tommy, but not much hurt." A bullet had ploughed through
      the lower part of his thigh, and as he spoke he tore two strips from his
      handkerchief, and bidding Tommy watch their hidden foes, cut open his
      moleskin pants, and hurriedly plugged the holes. As he was doing this, the
      firing again began, and they could hear the bullets spattering against the
      granite rock, or striking the saddles. After about thirty shots had been
      fired it again ceased.
    
    
      "Be ready, Tommy," whispered Gerrard; "they'll be here presently. Don't
      fire till they are quite close, then drop rifle and take pistol."
    
    
      "All right, boss. Look, look! You see one fellow now stand up       there
      'nother, 'nother       four fellow."
    
    
      The increasing starlight just enabled Gerrard to catch a brief glimpse of
      four figures moving about on the top of the boulder, then they
      disappeared, and he clutched his Winchester.
    
    
      Five anxious minutes passed, and then one by one the four forms appeared
      coming round from the other side of the boulder. For a few moments they
      halted, then came boldly out of the shadows into the starlight, and then a
      deadly rage leapt into Gerrard's heart as he recognised two of them. First
      the man whom Kate's father had handled so roughly on board the Gambier,
      and then the tall, imposing figure of Forreste.
    
    
      "Can you see their horses anywhere?" said the man who was in advance of
      his three companions, and they again stopped and looked about them.
    
    
      "Oh, they are all right," said a second voice; "well find 'em easy enough
      in the morning. They're both hobbled, and won't be far away. Now come on,
      Pinky, and show us your nigger with the top of his head off. You're a
      great gasser, I know. Strike a match, Barney, and I'll get a bit of dry
      ti-tree bark to give us a light."
    
    
      Gerrard pressed Tommy's arm. "Wait, Tommy, wait. Let them get a light. All
      the better for us. Listen!"
    
    
      "I suppose they are properly done for, Cheyne?" said Forreste, who had a
      revolver in his hand.
    
    
      "Oh, put your flaming pistol back into its pouch, you funky owl," snarled
      Barney Green, "they both dropped at the first time, as I told you. Gerrard
      fell on to the fire, and you'll find him cooking there, and that both of
      'em are as full of holes as a cullender. We've wasted a hundred cartridges
      for nothing, but I daresay we'll get some more. He had a forty-four
      Winchester, and the nigger a Snider."
    
    
      A match was struck, and the two motionless watchers saw Cheyne go to a
      ti-tree, which grew on the edge of the large pool, tear off the outer thin
      and wet bark, and then make a torch of the dry part, which lit easily.
      Pinkerton waved it to and fro for a few moments, and then held it up. It
      burst into flame.
    
    
      "Now, Tommy, quick! Take the big man," and as Gerrard spoke he covered
      Green.
    
    
      The two rifles rang out, and Forreste and the Jew fell. Pinkerton dropped
      the torch and tried to draw his revolver, but a second shot from Gerrard
      broke his leg, and he too dropped. Cheyne sprang off towards the pool,
      leapt in, and swam across to where their horses were hidden. Tommy, with
      all the lust of slaughter upon him, tomahawk in hand, ran round the pool
      to intercept him on the other side.
    
    
      "Let him go, Tommy, let him go!" shouted Gerrard, who was now feeling
      faint from loss of blood. "Come back, come back!" and as he spoke,
      Pinkerton, who could see him, began firing at him.
    
    
      The black boy obeyed just as Gerrard sank back upon the ground. The still
      blazing torch, however, revealed his prone figure to the American, who,
      rising upon one knee, reloaded his revolver. Then Tommy leapt at him,
      raised his tomahawk, and clove his head in twain.
    
    
      "Did he hit you, boss?" he cried, as, still holding the ensanguined weapon
      in his hand, he darted to his master.
    
    
      "No, Tommy, I'm all right, but bingie mine feel sick.{*} Get water for me,
      Tommy."
    

     * "I feel faint"

    
      The black boy ran down to the waterhole, filled his cabbage-tree hat with
      water, and Gerrard drank.
    
    
      "Go and see if those two men are dead, Tommy, If they are not, take their
      pistols away. Then make a big fire, and I will come and look at them."
    
    
      "All right, boss, but by and by." He raised and assisted Gerrard into the
      cave, laid him down upon his blanket, and placed his head upon one of the
      bullet-riddled saddles, re-lit the extinguished fire, took off his shirt,
      tore off the back, and bandaged his master's thigh with it.
    
    
      "You like smoke now, boss?" "Yes, fill my pipe before you go." Five
      minutes later Tommy returned. "All three fellow dead," he observed
      placidly, as he stooped down to the fire and lit his own pipe with a
      burning coal. "Big man me shoot got him bullet through chest; little man
      with black beard and nose like cockatoo you shoot, got him bullet through
      chest too, close up longa troat."
    
    
      Then he asked if he might go after the two horses, which, hobbled as they
      were, had gone off at the first sound of the firing, and were perhaps many
      miles away.
    
    
      "All right, Tommy. We must not let them get too far away."
    
    
      The black boy grunted an assent, made the fire blaze up, and taking up his
      own and Gerrard's bridles, disappeared.
    
    
      In less than half an hour he returned, riding one horse and leading the
      other, and found that Gerrard had risen and was looking at the bodies of
      the three men, which lay stark and stiff under the now bright starlight.
      Tommy's face wore an expression of supreme satisfaction as he jumped off
      his horse.
    
    
      "Other fellow man bung{*} too," he said in a complacent tone.
    

     * Bung       -dead.

    
      "Did you shoot him?" cried Gerrard, aghast at more bloodshed.
    
    
      "Baal me shoot him, boss. I find him longa place where all four fellow
      been camp in little gully. He been try to put saddle on horse, but fall
      down and die       boigan been bite him I think it, when he swim
      across waterhole."
    
    
      "Come and show me," said Gerrard, and, suffering as he was, he mounted his
      horse, and followed Tommy. In a few minutes they came to the place where
      Forreste and his gang had hidden their horses, all of which were tethered.
    
    
      Lying doubled up on the ground beside a saddle, was the body of Cheyne. He
      had succeeded in putting the bridle on his horse, and then had evidently
      fallen ere he could place the saddle on the animal.
    
    
      Gerrard struck a match, and held it to the dead man's face; it was purple,
      and hideous to look upon.
    
    
      "Boigan," said Tommy placidly, as he re-lit his pipe.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXI
    
    
      Three days passed before Gerrard and the black boy were able to leave the
      Rocky Waterholes. The bodies of their treacherous assailants they interred
      in the soft, sandy soil at the foot of one of the granite pillars, and
      then Gerrard took their valises containing their gold, together with their
      arms and saddle pouches, and rolled them in a blanket, which he strapped
      on one of the gang's horses, which was to serve as a pack. He intended to
      hand everything over to the Gold Commissioner, whom he expected to see at
      Ochos Rios in a few weeks, and who having judicial powers, would, he
      expected, hold the official inquiry into the deaths 'of the men at the
      station itself.
    
    
      Tommy made but little of his wound, and only grinned when Gerrard said he
      was lucky not to have had his jaw smashed by the bullet. He doctored it in
      the usual aboriginal manner: first powdering it with wood ashes, and then
      plastering the whole side of his face with wattle gum.
    
    
      "My word, Tommy," observed his master gravely, "you got him handsome
      fellow face now       all the same as me. Plenty fellow lubra want catch
      you now for benjamin."{*}
    

     * "Plenty of women will want to get you  now for a husband."

    
      Gerrard's own wound, although painful, did not prevent him from either
      walking or riding. The soft wattle gum was a splendid styptic, and two
      whole days and nights of complete rest did much to accelerate his
      recovery; and game being plentiful at and about the waterholes, he and
      Tommy made themselves as contented as possible, for there was still a
      clear week before the pearling lugger was due at the mouth of the Coen. He
      had changed his mind about letting Tommy go back alone along the beach,
      and decided to take him with him in the vessel. The boy's bravery had
      impressed him greatly, and although he knew his resourcefulness and
      abilities as a bushman, he thought it would not be fair       for the sake
      of two horses       to let him run the risk of being cut off by the
      coastal blacks, while on his way to the station. As for the horses, they
      would find their way home safely in all likelihood, unless they came
      across poison bush. The blacks did not often succeed in spearing loose
      horses, the slower-moving cattle being their favoured victims.
    
    
      They left the Rocky Waterholes as the strength of the afternoon sun began
      to wane, and headed due west As they rode round the side of the largest
      pool, the three horses of the dead men, which were camped under the shade
      of the Leichhardt trees, brushing the flies off each other's noses with
      their long tails, raised their heads inquiringly as if to say. "Are you
      going to leave us here?" and then sedately trotted after them.
    
    
      Gerrard turned in his saddle. "Let them follow us, if they like, Tommy.
      They will be company for 'Dutchman' and 'Waterboy.' I think they'll all
      turn up at the station by and by."
    
    
      The unexplored country from the Waterholes to the coast was very pleasant
      to see in all its diversified beauties: deep water-worn gullies whose
      sides were clothed with wild fig, wattle, and cabbage palms, opening out
      into fair forest country, well timbered with huge acacias and a species of
      white cedar, whose pale blue flowers filled the air with their delicious
      perfume. Bird life was plentiful, the chattering of long-tailed pheasants
      and the call of many kinds of parrots resounding everywhere, and filling
      the tree-clad gullies with melodious, reverberating echoes.
    
    
      Night came on swiftly, but a night of myriad stars in a sky of cloudless
      blue; and then, fifteen miles from the Rocky Waterholes, they came to a
      wide but shallow creek, whose banks were well grassed, and which offered a
      tempting resting-place. Here and there were clumps, or rather groves, of
      graceful pandanus palms, with long pendant leaves, rustling faintly to the
      cool night breeze.
    
    
      "We'll camp here till daylight, Tommy. I'm feeling a bit stiff."
    
    
      As Tommy unsaddled and hobbled out the horses, Gerrard lit a fire, made
      the two quart pots of tea, and he and the native had their supper. Then,
      although they had seen no signs of blacks since they had left Hansen's,
      they took unusual precautions to prevent being surprised, for Gerrard
      especially was not in a fit condition for much exertion. Letting the
      horses graze where they listed, they put out the fire, and carried their
      saddles, blankets, arms, etc., out to a sandbank in the middle of the
      creek, and made themselves comfortable for the night on the soft, warm
      sand       too far away from either bank to fear any danger from a shower
      of spears.
    
    
      The night wore all too quickly away for Gerrard, for as he lay on his
      blanket, gazing upward to the star-studded heavens, he forgot the pain of
      his wounds in his thoughts of Kate, and he sighed contentedly. In two
      weeks or so he would be by her side at Ocho Rios.
    
    
      There had never been what some people call "courtship" between Kate and
      Gerrard. When she came to the station on her promised visit, her father
      had come with her. He stayed a few days at Ocho Rios, and then set out on
      his return to Black Bluff Creek, accompanied by Gerrard, who was going
      part of the way with him. They had ridden for a mile or two from the
      station, chatting on various matters, when Gerrard suddenly drew rein.
    
    
      "Mr Fraser!"
    
    
      The old man looked up, wondering at the "Mr."
    
    
      "What is it, Gerrard?"
    
    
      "I am going to ask your daughter to marry me."
    
    
      Fraser could not help a smile. "There's no beating about the bush with
      you, Tom Gerrard." Then he put out his hand, and said with grave kindness:
      "You are the one man whom I should like to see her marry."
    
    
      "Thank you," and the younger man's face flushed with pleasure.
    
    
      Then Fraser, like the tactful man he was, said not a word more on the
      matter.
    
    
      "Look here, Gerrard, what is the use of your coming any further with me
      when you have so much to do? Get back, my son       and I wish you luck.
      Give Kate my love, and tell her I said so," and then shaking hands with
      his friend, he struck into a smart canter.
    
    
      Gerrard rode slowly home. Kate, Jim, and Mary were engaged in making a
      seine in the cool back verandah. Kate looked up with a smile, surprised
      and pleased to see him back so soon.
    
    
      "Will you come with me and shoot some guinea-fowl, Miss Fraser?" Then he
      hurriedly turned to Jim: "You need not come, Jim. Go on with the seine."
    
    
      An hour later they returned       without any guinea-fowl. Gerrard was in
      high spirits. He slapped Jim on the back.
    
    
      "Let the seine rip, Jim, and get your gun, and we'll try and get some
      pheasants. We couldn't see a blessed guinea-fowl anywhere; could we, Kate?"
    
    
      "No, Tom, we could not; they are horribly scarce to-day, Jim," she
      replied demurely, as she fled to her room.
    
    
      After a quiet, restful night, Gerrard and Tommy made an early start,
      driving the pack-horse in front of them, and followed by the three spare
      horses. All that day they travelled slowly, and at sunset reached the
      mouth of the alligator-haunted Coen, where, to Gerrard's delight, they saw
      a smart, white-painted lugger lying at anchor. In answer to their loud coo-e-e!
      a boat manned by two Malays, put off, and the master jumped ashore.
    
    
      "How are you, Mr Gerrard? You see I'm three days sooner than I said, but
      we got a rattling north-westerly as soon as we rounded Cape York. But what
      is wrong with your face, Mr Gerrard?" he added sympathetically; "and
      you're lame too, I see. Niggers, I suppose?"
    
    
      "No, we haven't even seen a nigger, Captain Lowry. But I'll tell you the
      whole yarn by and by, after we get aboard. Got any arnica?"
    
    
      "Plenty, and whips of plaster too. I'll soon fix you up, ship-shape and
      Bristol fashion."
    
    
      "Thank you, captain," said Gerrard, as he and Tommy began to unsaddle the
      horses; "I'll be glad if you will. I don't want to get back to the station
      until I look a little bit less patchy. And so if you are agreeable, I'll
      be glad if we go on a bit of a cruise along the coast for about ten days
      or so."
    
    
      "I'm agreeable       more days, more dollars. But it will cost you another
      fifty pounds or so above the charter money."
    
    
      "Well, I shall spend it for the benefit of my complexion, Lowry. Now,
      hurry up with our traps, Tommy, I'm going to eat a supper that will
      astonish you, Lowry."
    
    
      As soon as he reached the vessel he went below, and wrote letters to his
      sister and Kate, enclosed them in an old piece of an oilskin coat given
      him by Lowry, then called Tommy, and told him to go on shore again, and
      secure it to Waterboy's mane. His object was to allay any fears about him
      if the two station horses got to Ocho Rios before the lugger. The yellow
      packet would be sure to be noticed, and opened. He had carefully avoided
      any mention of his encounter with Aulain, and had also cautioned Tommy on
      the subject: he did not want his sister and Kate to know anything of the
      matter, from himself at least. He had decided upon a pardonable fiction       he
      would tell them that he had been thrown from his horse, and received a
      rather bad cut; of his bullet wound and the tragedy at the Rocky
      Waterholes he made no allusion.
    
    
      "It's no use worrying them over nothing," he said to Lowry, when he had
      told the seaman the story of the attack by Forreste and his gang. "In a
      week or so I'll be as fit as you are. But you'll have to back me up in
      what I have written about you being afraid that we are in for a week or
      two of calm; they won't forgive me in a hurry if they ascertain that
      instead of being becalmed, the Fanny Sabina was cruising merrily
      about the Gulf of Carpentaria."
    
    
      Lowry gave his promise, and then he and his passenger had supper on deck
      under the awning which covered the smart little vessel's deck from bow to
      stern.
    
    
      At dawn next morning, Gerrard, after a delightfully refreshing sleep, was
      awakened by the captain.
    
    
      "Rouse up, Mr Gerrard. We're underway, and I want to know the programme."
    
    
      "How far to Cape Keerweer?"
    
    
      "Four days' sail in such light weather as this."
    
    
      "That will suit me. I'll be able to begin to enjoy myself by then, and I
      want to see those big lagoons near the Cape. Tommy says that they are
      alive with game, and you and I can put in a day or two there."
    
    
      "Just the thing. I've a couple of good guns on board," then he turned to
      the man at the tiller.
    
    
      "Keep her south, my lad. For'ard there, set the squaresail. Now, Mr
      Gerrard, you'll see what the little Fanny Sabina can do even in a
      light wind like this," and Lowry looked with an air of pride at his dainty
      little craft.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXII
    
    
      On the evening of the eleventh day, after leaving the Coen, the cutter let
      go her anchor at a spot about a mile from the wreck of the old Dutch ship,
      and Gerrard prepared to go on shore, for he meant to walk to the station
      that night. He had now so completely recovered from both the bullet wound
      and the slash inflicted by Aulain's whip, that Lowry declared he looked
      all the better for what he had gone through.
    
    
      "Well, I should not grumble, I suppose, Lowry," said his passenger, as he
      surveyed his features in the cabin mirror over the captain's table, "but
      it is enough to make any one swear. Just as I was getting rid of the
      alligator beauty marks on one side of my face, I get a thundering slash on
      the other, which will take another three months to get tanned up to the
      rich, soiled leather hue of the rest of my hide."
    
    
      As he was speaking, Tommy put his black face down through the open
      skylight, and said that he could see a camp fire on shore       just above
      the landing-place.
    
    
      "It must be some one from the station, Lowry," cried Gerrard, as he and
      the captain came on deck, and as he spoke, there came a coo-e-e!
      from the shore. It was Jim's voice. He answered at once.
    
    
      Bidding the mate hang a riding light on the forestay, Lowry got his night
      glasses, and turned them upon the fire.
    
    
      "There are four people, Mr Gerrard, with six or seven horses. Ah, they are
      rigging a tent. I suppose it is a party from the station. They must have
      seen us before dark, and have come to meet you. Well, the boat is all
      ready for you, sir."
    
    
      In a few minutes Gerrard and Tommy were being paddled swiftly to the
      shore, and as they drew nearer the fire, they were able to make out the
      four figures as those of Kate, Mary Rayner, Jim, and a white stockman. All
      were busied about the tent, and as yet had not seen the boat. Then Gerrard
      gave a loud hail.
    
    
      "Hallo there, you people!"
    
    
      An answering yell from Jim and a shriek of delight from Mary, and as the
      boat's bows cut into the soft sand, they rushed towards it, followed by
      Kate. Disengaging himself from their frantic embraces he met Kate, and
      drew her to him.
    
    
      "All well, Kate?"
    
    
      "Yes, Tom," she whispered.
    
    
      "What brought you here?"
    
    
      "Your letter, of course! Waterboy and the other horse came home this
      afternoon, and Lizzie said that if we liked we could come and camp here
      until you came. And just after dark, as we got here, we fancied we heard
      the sound of the vessel anchoring, and so Jim coo-e-e-d."
    
    
      Gerrard bent towards her again.
    
    
      "Mary and Jim, run along and help poor Harry with the tent." Then in a
      whisper: "Tom, keep quiet       we are right in the light of the fire."
    
    
      "Yes, run along," added Gerrard; "we'll be with you in a minute. Oh, Jim,
      stop a moment! Would you and Mary like to go on board the vessel to-morrow
      morning, and see Captain Lowry's curios?"
    
    
      "Oh, yes, Uncle," was the unsuspecting reply.
    
    
      "Then you and Harry can camp here tonight, and have a good time on board
      in the morning. I'm in no end of a hurry to get home, and see your Aunt
      Lizzie. But I'll be back before breakfast to-morrow."
    
    
      "Are you staying with us too, Miss Fraser?" asked Jim.
    
    
      "No, I think I had better go on with your uncle. It wouldn't be fair to
      let him ride home alone, would it?"
    
    
      "No, I suppose not," observed Jim with unnecessary dryness in his voice;
      "he might get lost."
    
    
      Gerrard laughed, and tried to seize the lad by his arm, but he was too
      quick for him.
    
    
      "How are you, Harry?" he said to the stockman, as he held out his hand.
      "Cattle all right?"
    
    
      "Right as rain, boss. How's yourself?"
    
    
      "Bully. Oh, I say, Harry; the youngsters want very much to have a look at
      the ship to-morrow. I daresay you would too."
    
    
      "I would, boss, seein' 'as I never was on board a real sailin' boat."
    
    
      "Well, you can all go on board to-morrow. Miss Fraser and I will push on
      home, so if you'll saddle our horses for us, I'll finish the tent for
      you."
    
    
      A quarter of an hour later everything had been finished       the tent set
      up, and the horses saddled and in readiness.
    
    
      "Good-night, youngsters," cried Gerrard, swinging himself into his saddle,
      and then with Kate by his side, they turned their horses heads toward the
      dark line of sleeping forest.
    
    
      "Oh, Tom, I forgot," said Kate, after they had ridden for a mile or so; "I
      have some letters for you," and she took them out of her saddle pouch.
    
    
      The master of Ocho Rios let fall his reins, and glanced at the
      superscriptions on the envelopes.
    
    
      "Pull up a minute, Kate. I want to look at this one       the others can
      wait."
    
    
      He opened the letter, lit a match, and glanced at the few lines it
      contained. Then he threw away the match, and placed the letter in his
      pocket.
    
    
      "Kate."
    
    
      "Yes, Tom dear?"
    
    
      "It's from Templeton" (the Gold Commissioner).
    
    
      "Well, Tom?"
    
    
      "Well, Kate? He will be at Ocho Rios on the 27th. Are you glad, or is it
      too soon for you?"
    
    
      "No, Tom," she whispered.
    
    
      He drew her to him once more, and pressed his lips to hers, and then in
      happy silence, side by side, they cantered home through the darkened
      forest and under the star-lit sky.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
