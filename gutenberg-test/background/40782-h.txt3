The scholarly and scientific publications of the United States National Museum
include two series, Proceedings of the United States National Museum and United States
National Museum Bulletin.

In these series, the Museum publishes original articles and monographs dealing
with the collections and work of its constituent museums&mdash;The Museum of Natural
History and the Museum of History and Technology&mdash;setting forth newly acquired
facts in the fields of anthropology, biology, history, geology, and technology. Copies
of each publication are distributed to libraries, to cultural and scientific organizations,
and to specialists and others interested in the different subjects.

The Proceedings, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in separate
form, of shorter papers from the Museum of Natural History. These are gathered
in volumes, octavo in size, with the publication date of each paper recorded in the
table of contents of the volume.

In the Bulletin series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appear longer, separate
publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in several parts) and volumes
in which are collected works on related subjects. Bulletins are either octavo or
quarto in size, depending on the needs of the presentation. Since 1902 papers relating
to the botanical collections of the Museum of Natural History have been
published in the Bulletin series under the heading Contributions from the United States
National Herbarium, and since 1959, in Bulletins titled &ldquo;Contributions from the Museum
of History and Technology,&rdquo; have been gathered shorter papers relating to the collections
and research of that Museum.

The present collection of Contributions, Papers 34-44, comprises Bulletin 240.

THE 1893 DURYEA AUTOMOBILE

In the Museum of History and Technology


During the last decade of the nineteenth century a number of
American engineers and mechanics were working diligently to develop
a practical self-propelled vehicle employing an internal-combustion
engine as the motive force. Among these men were Charles and Frank
Duryea, who began work on this type of vehicle about 1892. This
carriage was operated on the streets of Springfield, Massachusetts,
in 1893, where its trials were noted in the newspapers. Now
preserved in the Museum of History and Technology, it is a prized
exhibit in the collection of early automobiles.

It is the purpose of this paper to present some of the facts
discovered during the restoration of the vehicle, to show the
problems that faced its builders, and to describe their solutions.
An attempt also has been made to correlate all this information
with reports of the now almost legendary day-to-day experiences of
the Duryeas, as published by the brothers in various booklets, and
as related by Frank Duryea during two interviews, recorded on tape
in 1956 and 1957, while he was visiting the Smithsonian.

The Author: Don H. Berkebile is on the staff of the Museum of
History and Technology, in the Smithsonian Institution's United
States National Museum.


Of the numerous American automotive pioneers, perhaps among the best
known are Charles and Frank Duryea. Beginning their work of automobile
building in Springfield, Massachusetts, and after much rebuilding, they
constructed their first successful vehicle in 1892 and 1893. No sooner
was this finished than Frank, working alone, began work on a second
vehicle having a two-cylinder engine. With this automobile, sufficient
capital was attracted in 1895 to form the Duryea Motor Wagon Company in
which both brothers were among the stockholders and directors. A short
time after the formation of the company this second automobile was
entered by the company in the Chicago Times-Herald automobile race on
Thanksgiving Day, November 28, 1895, where Frank Duryea won a victory
over the other five contestants&mdash;two electric automobiles and three Benz
machines imported from Germany.

In the year following this victory Frank, as engineer in charge of
design and construction, completed the plans begun earlier for a more
powerful automobile. During 1896 the company turned out thirteen
identical automobiles, the first example of mass production in American
[4]
automotive history.[1]
Even while these cars were under construction Frank was planning a
lighter vehicle, one of which was completed in October of 1896. This
machine was driven to another victory by Frank Duryea on November 14,
1896, when he competed once again with European-built cars in the
Liberty-Day Run from London to Brighton. The decision to race and
demonstrate their autos abroad was the result of the company's desire to
interest foreign capital, yet Frank later felt they might better have
used their time and money by concentrating on building cars and selling
them to the local market. Subsequently, in the fall of 1898, Frank
arranged for the sale of his and Charles' interest in the company, and
thereafter the brothers pursued separate careers.

&nbsp;

Frank, in 1901, entered into a contract with the J. Stevens Arms and
Tool Company, of Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts, which built automobiles
under his supervision. This association led in 1904 to the formation of
the Stevens-Duryea Company, of which Irving Page was president and Frank
Duryea was vice president and chief engineer. This company produced
during its 10-year existence a number of popular and well-known models,
among them a light six known as the Model U, in 1907; a larger
4-cylinder called the Model X, in 1908; and a larger six, the Model Y,
in 1909. In 1914 when Stevens withdrew from the company, Frank obtained
control. The following year he sold the plants and machinery, liquidated
the company, and, due to ill health, retired.

Charles, in the meantime, located in Reading,
[5]
Pennsylvania, where he built autos under the name of the Duryea Power
Company.[2]
Here, and
later in Philadelphia under the name of the Duryea Motor Corporation and
other corporate names, he continued for a number of years to build
automobiles, vacuum cleaners and other mechanical devices. Until the
time of his death in 1938, he practiced as a consulting engineer.

Early Automotive Experience



Figure 4.&mdash;Charles E. Duryea, about 1894,
as drawn by George Giguere from a photograph.(Smithsonian photo 48335-A.)


Born in 1861 near Canton, Illinois, Charles E. Duryea had learned the
trade of a mechanic following his graduation from high school, and
subsequently turned his interests to bicycle repair. He and his brother
James Frank, eight years younger, eventually left Illinois and moved to
Washington D.C., where they were employed in the bicycle shop of H. S.
Owen, one of that city's leading bicycle dealers and importers. While in
Washington, Charles became a regular reader of the Patent Office
Gazette,[3]
an act which undoubtedly influenced his later work with
automobiles. A short time later, probably in 1889, Charles contracted
with a firm in Rockaway, New Jersey, to construct bicycles for him, but
their failure to make delivery as promised caused him to go to Chicopee,
Massachusetts, where he contracted with the Ames Manufacturing Company
to do his work. Moving there in 1890, he obtained for his brother a
position as toolmaker with the Ames Company. Thus, Frank Duryea, as he
was later known, also became located in Chicopee, a northern suburb of
Springfield.

During the summer, 1891, Charles found the bicycle business left him
some spare time, and the gasoline-powered
[6]
carriages he had read of
earlier came constantly into his mind in these periods of
idleness.[4]
He and Frank studied several books on gasoline engines, among them one
by an English writer (title and author now
unknown);[5]
this described
the Otto 4-stroke cycle as now used. Some engineers, however, were
concerned because this engine, on the completion of the exhaust stroke,
had not entirely evacuated all of the products of combustion. The
Atkinson engine, patented in 1887, was one of the attempts to solve this
as well as several other problems, thus creating a more efficient cycle.
This engine was designed so that the exhaust stroke carried the piston
all the way to the head of the engine, while the compression stroke only
moved the piston far enough to sufficiently compress the mixture. The
unusual linkage necessary to create these unequal strokes in the
Atkinson engine made it seem impractical for a carriage engine, where
compactness was desired.



Figure 5.&mdash;Advertisement

Going to Hartford, Connecticut, possibly on business relating to his
bicycle work, Charles visited the Hartford Machine Screw Company where
the Daimler-type engine was being
produced,[6]
but after examining it he
felt it was too heavy and clumsy for his purpose. Also in Hartford he
talked over the problem of a satisfactory engine with C. E. Hawley, an
employee of the Pope Manufacturing Company, makers of the Columbia
bicycle. Hawley, searching for a way to construct an engine that would
perform in a manner similar to the Atkinson, yet would have the
lightness and compactness necessary for a carriage engine, suggested an
idea that Charles believed had some merit. This idea, involving the use
of what the Duryeas later called a "free piston," was eventually to be
incorporated in their first
engine.[7]

Construction Begins

Back in Chicopee again, Charles began planning his first horseless
carriage. Frank later stated that they leaned heavily on the Benz
patents in their work;[8]
but while the later engine and transmission
show evidence of this, only the Benz manner of placing the engine and
the flywheel seem to have been employed in the original Duryea plan.
Charles reversed the engine so that the flywheel was to the front,
rather than to the rear as in the Benz patent, but made use of Benz'
vertical crankshaft so that the flywheel rotated in a horizontal plane.
Previously most engines had used vertical flywheels; Benz, believing
that this practice would cause difficulty in steering a propelled
[7]
carriage, explained his reason for changing this feature in his U.S.
patent 385087, issued June 26, 1888:

In motors hitherto used the fly-wheels have been attached to a
horizontal shaft or axle, and have thus been made to revolve in a
vertical plane, since the horizontal shaft is best adapted to the
transmission of power. If, however, in this case we should use a
heavy rotating mass, corresponding to the power employed and
revolving rapidly in a vertical plane, the power to manage the
vehicle or boat would become very much lessened, as the flywheel
continues to revolve in its plane. I therefore so design the
apparatus that its crank shaft x has a vertical position and its
fly-wheel y revolves in a horizontal plane&#8230;. By this means the
vehicle is not only easily controlled, but also the greatest safety
is attained against capsizing.

To the Duryea plan, Benz may also have contributed the idea for
positioning the countershaft, though its location is sufficiently
obvious that Charles may have had no need for copying Benz. Charles
wisely differed from Benz in placing the flywheel forward, thus
eliminating the need for the long driving belt of the Benz carriage. Yet
he did reject the bevel gears used by Benz, which might well have been
retained, as Frank was later to prove by designing a workable
transmission that incorporated such bevel gears. The initial plan, as
conceived by Charles, also included the details of the axles, steering
gear, countershaft with its friction-drum, the 2-piece angle-iron frame
upon which the countershaft bearings were mounted, and the free piston
engine with its ignition tube, since hot-tube ignition was to be
employed. No provision was made, however, for a burner to heat the tube;
nor had a carburetor been designed, though it had been decided not to
use a surface tank carburetor. The plans called for no muffler or
starting
arrangement.[9]
Many engines of the period were started simply
by turning the flywheel with the hands, and Charles felt this method was
sufficient for his carriage.

Duryeas were trying to achieve with their free-piston engine, by

1953.(Daimler-Benz Company publication.)


The Ames plant customarily had a summer shutdown during August; thus,
during August of 1891 Charles and Frank had access to a nearly empty
plant in which they could carry on experiments and make up working
drawings of the proposed vehicle. It cannot now be conclusively stated
whether any parts were made for the car during August or the remainder
of the year. It is more likely that the brothers attempted to complete a
set of drawings. Frank Harrington, chief draftsman at Ames, may have
helped out at this time; from Charles' statement of April 14, 1937, it
is learned that he did prepare drawings during 1892.

The first contemporary record of any work on vehicles is a bill, dated
January 21, 1892, for a drawing made by George W. Howard &amp; Company. This
drawing was made in the fall of 1891 by Charles A. Bartlett, a member of
the Howard firm and a neighbor of Charles Duryea, according to a
statement by Charles in the Automobile Trade Journal of Jan. 10, 1925.
He was then also of the opinion that this drawing may not have had
anything to do with the carriage they were about to assemble, but a
notation found by Charles at a later date has led him to believe that it
possibly concerned a business type vehicle he had discussed with an
unidentified Mr. Snow.

By early 1892 Charles needed capital to finance his venture, an old
carriage to attach his inventions to, a place to work, and a mechanic to
do the work. On March 26, he stopped by the Smith Carriage Company and
looked over a selection of used buggies and phaetons. He finally decided
on a rather well-used ladies' phaeton which he purchased for $70. The
leather dash was in so deplorable a state it would have to be recovered
before the carriage went onto the road, and the leather fenders it once
possessed had previously been removed; yet the upholstery appeared to be
in satisfactory condition, and the candle lamps were intact.

&nbsp;

Father of the Automobile Industry, by L. M. Fanning, New York, 1955.)
&nbsp;

Two days later, Charles was able to interest Erwin F. Markham, of
Springfield, sufficiently to obtain his financial aid in the project. A
contract was
[9]
drawn up between the two men, which stated that Mr.
Markham was to put up $1000 for which he received a five-tenths share of
the venture. When the $1000 had been used, he then had the option to
continue his aid until the project had been carried to a successful
climax, and retain his half share, or to refuse further funds and
relinquish four of his five-tenths interest in the
business.[10]
Had he
eventually chosen the latter, Charles would obviously have had to seek
assistance elsewhere.

this may not refer specificallyto the machine now in the museum,
it is evidence of early work.

That same day, March 28, Charles found working space and machinery
available at John W. Russell &amp; Sons Company in
Springfield.[11]
The Russells had recently completed a large government order of shells for
the famous dynamite guns later used on board the cruiser Vesuvius in
the Spanish-American War, and this left an entire second floor,
approximately 35 &times; 85 feet, virtually unoccupied, according to an
affidavit of William J. Russell of April 30, 1926. Now ready to begin
the actual work, Charles hired his brother Frank to start construction.
Frank started about the first of April, receiving a raise of about 10
percent over the salary he had received at Ames. Before the vehicle was
completed a number of other men performed work on some of the parts,
among them William Deats who had been hired by Charles primarily to work on
[10]
bicycles in the same area, but who occasionally assisted on the
carriage. Russell Company records show time charged against Charles
Duryea by six other Russell employees: W. J. Russell, P. Colgan, C. E.
Merrick, T. Shea, L. J. Parmelee, and A. A. Poissant.

It is Frank Duryea's remembrance that he started work on Monday, April
4. He first removed the body, with its springs, and placed it on a pair
of wooden horses where it remained until the summer of the following
year. The next step was to remove the rear axle and take it to a
blacksmith shop where the old axle spindles were cut off and welded to a
new drop-center axle. Following this the front axle spindles were
removed, the ends of the axle slotted, and a webbed, C-shaped piece
carrying the kingpin bearings was fitted into each slot, braced from
underneath by short brackets which were riveted and brazed in place. The
old spindles then were welded to the center of offset kingpins which in
turn were mounted in their bearings in a manner similar to that in which
the frame of the Columbia high-wheeled bicycle was mounted in its fork.
Arms welded to the lower end of the kingpins were connected by the tie
rods to an arm on the lower end of the vertical steering column, located
on the center of the axle.

records showing charges made againstCharles Duryea during 1893-1894.


While work on the running gear advanced, some progress was made in the
construction of the engine.
[11]
Patterns for the castings were fabricated,
most of them by Charles Marshall on Taylor
Street,[12]
and castings were
poured. The body or main casting of the engine resembled a length of
cast-iron pipe: it had no bosses or lugs cast on, nor any water jacket,
for they thought the engine would be kept cool merely by being placed in
the open air. The front end of the engine was secured to the vehicle by
four bolts which passed through the halves of the bearings and onto four
projections on the open end of the engine. As the crankshaft of this
engine was retained in constructing the present engine, it is logical
to assume that the bearings were the same also. The head was cast as a
thick disc, with both intake and exhaust valves located therein, and was
bolted onto the flanged head end of the engine.

Inside the cylinder was the strange arrangement previously suggested by
C. E. Hawley. To the connecting rod was attached a rather ordinary
ringed piston, over which was fitted a free, ringless piston, machined
to fit closely the cylinder bore. This floating piston could move freely
a distance equal to the compression space. The intention was that on the
intake stroke, suction would open the intake valve, which had no
positive opening arrangement, and draw in the mixture which then was
compressed as in a regular Otto engine. Fired by the hot-tube ignition
system, the force of the explosion would drive both pistons down,
forcing the outer one tight against the head of the smaller one, and at
the end of the stroke the longer wall of the outer piston would strike
an arm projecting into the cylinder near the open end, moving forward
the exhaust valve rod to which the arm was attached, thus pushing open
the valve in the
head.[13]
On the exhaust stroke the unrestrained outer
piston moved all the way to the head, expelling all of the products of
combustion and pushing the exhaust valve shut again. With a bore of four
inches or less, this engine, Charles believed, should develop about
three horsepower and run at a speed between 350 to 400 revolutions per
minute.[14]

As no ignition system had yet been provided, they prepared a 4&#189;-inch
length of one-quarter inch iron pipe, closed at one end, and screwed the
open end into the head. Heating this tube with an alcohol burner would
cause ignition of the mixture when a portion of it was forced into the
heated tube toward the end of the compression stroke. No attempt was
made at this time to use the electrical make-and-break circuit used in
their second engine, as the free piston would have wrecked the igniter
parts on the exhaust stroke, and the push rod located on the end of the
piston would have prevented the piston from closing the exhaust valve.

After keying the flywheel to the lower end of the crankshaft, Charles
and Frank decided to make an
[12]
attempt to run the engine. Carrying it
into a back room, probably during July or August, 1892, they blocked it
up on horses. A carburetor had not yet been constructed, so they
attempted to start the engine by spinning the flywheel by hand, at the
same time spraying gasoline through the intake valve with a perfume
atomizer previously purchased at a drugstore in the Massasoit House.
Repeated efforts of the two men to start the engine resulted in failure.

In the belief that the defects, whatever they might be, could be
remedied after the engine was installed, the Duryeas went ahead and
mounted the engine in the carriage. To do this they shortened the
original reach of the carriage, allowing the engine itself to become the
rear continuation of the reach. The four ears on the front, or open end
of the engine, were bolted to the centrally located frame, with the
bearing blocks in between. This frame, the same one now in the vehicle,
was constructed of two pieces of angle iron, riveted and brazed
together. Greater rigidity was obtained by a number of half-inch iron
rods running from the frame to both front and rear axles. Because of the
absence of any mounting brackets on the engine casting itself, a wooden
block with a trough on top to receive the body of the engine was fitted
between the engine and the axle, while two U-shaped rods secured it with
clip bars and nuts underneath.

Beneath the flywheel was mounted the friction transmission of Charles'
design. This consisted of a large drum, perhaps 12 inches in diameter,
equal in length to the diameter of the flywheel and keyed to a shaft
directly under the center of the crankshaft and parallel to the axles.
(Diameter of drum estimated by examination of existing features.) In
view of the four projections of the frame extending downward and just in
front of the jackshaft position, it is likely that these supported the
four jackshaft bearings. Being a bicycle manufacturer, Charles saw the
need for a differential or balance gear. Accordingly, he purchased from
the Pope Manufacturing Company a very light unit of the type formerly
used on Columbia tricycles, and installed it somewhere on the jackshaft.
A small sprocket on each end of the shaft carried a chain from the
larger sprockets clamped to the spokes of each rear wheel. The lower
surface of the flywheel had been machined so as to form a friction disc,
with a one-quarter inch depression 3 inches in diameter turned in the
center. The drum was positioned so that its upper surface was
one-quarter inch below the face of the flywheel. Hanging loosely around
the drum was an endless belt, one and one-half inches wide, first made
of rather soft rubber packing material. The belt lay on the drum surface
between the fingers of a shipper fork. While it lay under the 3-inch
depression in the center of the flywheel, the belt and the drum were at
rest, but when it was moved away from that depression the belt wedged
itself tightly between the drum and flywheel, the resulting friction
causing the drum to turn and setting the vehicle into motion. The
farther the belt was moved toward the outer edge of the wheel, the
faster the drum and the vehicle moved.

In September 1892, Charles, who had contracted with a Peoria, Illinois,
firm to have bicycle parts manufactured, decided to move to that city.
Departing on the 22d of September, he did not return to Springfield for
over two years, and thus was not able to participate in the completion
and testing of the
[13]
carriage. At the time of his departure several units
on the carriage were incomplete. A carburetor had not been built, nor
had a satisfactory burner or belt-shifting device. Charles had
experimented with various shifting levers just before leaving
Springfield: however, as he reported later, he did not succeed in
designing a workable
mechanism.[15]
Frank Duryea, now left to finish the
work unassisted, continued the experiments with the belt shifter. He
finally worked out a fork mounted on a carriage that was supported by
two rods, each of which slid in two bearings. Although the short
distance between the two bearings caused the shifter carriage to bind
occasionally, the device was thought to be sufficient and was installed
just in front of the frame. Connected to a system of cables, arms, and
rods, possibly similar to the present cam-bar shifter, the shipper-fork
carriage was moved from side to side by raising or lowering the tiller.

Turning now to an efficient burner for heating the ignition tube, Frank
started with an ordinary wick-type kerosene lamp with a small metal
tank. Wishing to use gasoline in the lamp, he found it necessary to
fabricate a number of burner units before he found a type that gave him
a clean blue flame. He then found the flame to be very sensitive to
drafts and easily extinguished, and devised a small shield or chimney to
afford it some protection.

Early in October, while still working with the burner, Frank developed a
severe headache. He felt the fumes of the lamp had probably caused it,
and went to his room in the home of a Mr. and Mrs. Patrick on Front
Street in Chicopee. After he noticed no improvement, a doctor's
examination showed he had typhoid fever, and on October 5 he was
admitted to the Springfield Hospital. Here he remained for one month,
being discharged on November 5. Returning to his room he was informed
that because of the fear that he might be a typhoid carrier, the
Patricks preferred him to find other lodgings. He readily accepted the
invitation of Mr. and Mrs. D. H. Nesbitt of Chicopee to take a room with
them. After several weeks recuperation in their home, he left
Springfield to visit his mother in Wyoming, Illinois.

After a restful visit at home Frank Duryea returned to Springfield and
finished the work on his burner. Now only the lack of a carburetor
prevented a trial of the vehicle. He recalls that he studied several
gasoline-engine catalogs and in one of them, a Fairbanks catalog he
believes,[16]
he saw a design that seemed to suit his needs. He decided
to simplify the construction and operation of his carburetor and had a
small bronze casting made to form the body of it. Inside was a gasoline
chamber with two tapped openings, one to receive a pipe from the
2-gallon gasoline tank mounted above the engine, the other taking a pipe
to the overflow tank underneath the engine, thus maintaining the
gasoline level without the use of a float valve. This latter tank had a
hand pump on one end so that the overflow gasoline could at times be
pumped again into the main tank. Gasoline passed from the carburetor
chamber through a needle valve, adjusted by a knob on top, then through
a tiny tube that entered the pipe leading to the intake valve. It is not
certain whether this intake pipe was at first fitted with the choke
arrangement later used with the second engine.

Frank, hoping at last to be rewarded for his efforts by the sound of
explosions from the engine, was ready to give the carriage an indoor
trial. Standing astraddle of the reach and facing to the rear, he spun
the flywheel with both hands, taking care not to get his hands caught
between the wheel and the frame. His efforts were in vain, as there was
complete failure to obtain ignition. He then made a new ignition tube,
nearly twice as long as the original 4-&#189;-inch tube, and turned down
its wall as thin as he thought safety allowed. The thinner wall did not
conduct the heat off so rapidly and thus kept the tube hot enough to
permit ignition. After this slight change, he was able to get a few
occasional explosions but he does not now believe that the engine ever
operated continuously. Each explosion was accompanied by a
[14]
loud knock, due, undoubtedly, to the movement of the free piston. Had
the engine operated continuously, it is likely that the action of the
free piston would have shortly wrecked the engine. Further efforts
appeared unwarranted until alterations could be made.

[15]

The two pistons were first pinned together into a single unit which was
probably ringless, since it is believed the walls of the outer piston
were too thin to admit rings. Because the piston no longer struck the
exhaust valve, a short rod had to be screwed into the pistonhead; this
pushed the valve shut at the completion of the exhaust stroke. The
remaining problem, the opening of the exhaust valve, was solved by
screwing a device to the side of the cylinder which operated from the
sidewise motion of the connecting rod. This device shifted a small
spacer between the piston and the striker arm of the exhaust-valve rod,
permitting the piston to push open the exhaust valve. On alternating
strokes the spacer shifted back out of the cylinder; therefore, no
contact was made between piston and striker arm. Sometime in February
1893, the altered engine was successfully started.

At last the transmission could be tested. Will Russell had come upstairs
to watch the trial, and according to a statement by him, given April 30,
1926, Frank, standing to the right of the engine and behind the rear
axle, reached forward and with the combination tiller-belt-shifter,
moved the belt into driving position. The carriage started forward, but
as it approached the wall of the building Frank discovered that he could
not get the belt back into the neutral position. In desperation, he
grasped the rear axle with both hands and was dragged a short distance,
attempting to stop the machine, before it struck the wall. He had,
however, sufficiently retarded it so that no damage was done.

This short trial demonstrated some of the weaknesses in the friction
transmission. Since the speed of the surface of the flywheel, in feet
per second, increased in proportion to the distance of the point of
contact from the center, the outer edge of the belt attempted to run
faster than the inner edge. This conflict of forces not only put an
undue load on the motor causing a great loss of power, but it also
created a tendency for the belt to work towards the outer edge of the
flywheel. Conversely, when the operator desired to return the belt to
neutral, it strongly resisted any efforts to slide it toward the center
of the wheel, as Frank had learned from the wall-bumping incident.
Furthermore, the rubber belt on the friction drum had worn so badly
that it had to be replaced at least once during the brief experiments.



Figure 18.&mdash;Ignition chamber, switch,
and breaker contacts of the present Duryea engine.



At this point, Frank and Markham felt that the carriage was anything but
satisfactory. While they were trying to decide what steps should be
taken next, Frank added one last improvement to the engine. Fearing that
the uncooled cylinder might suffer damage from the excessive heat, he
constructed a copper water jacket in two halves, drew them together
around the cylinder with clamping rings and soldered the seams. Asbestos
packing sealed the end joints where the jacket contacted the cylinder.
Thinking back, Frank does not recall that he ever used a water tank with
this engine, though he does remember adding water through the upper
jacket opening. The engine was run only for a few brief periods
following this addition.

Obviously this collection of patchwork could not fulfill their needs for
an engine. First, it would be next to impossible to start if the body
was placed on the running gear, as the flywheel then would be
practically inaccessible. The absence of rings on the piston caused a
further loss of power to the already overloaded engine. The flywheel was
too light. The absence of any form of governor left the operator with no
control over the engine speed. Ignition was poor, partly owing to the
hot-tube arrangement, and partly to the excessive distance between the
engine and the carburetor. Frank wrote his brother Charles on February
6[17]
that in his opinion the mixing chamber was so far from the engine
that the gasoline could not be drawn into the cylinder as liquid, and it
was too cold to vaporize and go in as gas. Thus he had difficulty in
getting the engine started. When it did start the explosions were
unmuffled. Less important to him than these defects, however, was the
awkward and unsightly wooden engine mount.





[16]

Description of the Automobile


Sometime in the early part of March, Frank convinced Markham that he
could construct a new and practical engine, using only previously tried
mechanical principles.[18]
Drawing up new plans for this engine, he took
them to Charles Marshall who began work on the patterns for the new
engine castings. After the patterns had been delivered to the foundry,
Frank left Springfield for a short vacation in Groton, Connecticut,
where he visited with his fianc&eacute;e. On May 17, 1893, several weeks after
his return to Springfield, they were married.

The engine castings were undoubtedly received from the foundry prior to
Frank Duryea's marriage, and the work of machining and assembling the
parts went on through the spring and summer. This engine, still on the
carriage in the Museum of History and Technology, is cased with a water
jacket, and has bases on top to support the front and rear bearings of
the starting crankshaft, and a base with port on the upper right side
where the exhaust-valve housing was to be bolted. On the underside are
two flanges, forming a base for seating the engine on the axle. A
separate combustion chamber is cast and bolted to the head. Inside this
chamber are located the igniter parts of Frank's electric ignition
system. The fixed part, an insulated electrode, is screwed into the
right side of the chamber and is connected with the ignition switch
outside, to which one of the ignition wires is attached. A breaker arm
inside is pinned to a small shaft extending through the top of the
chamber. Around the breaker-arm shaft is a small coil spring (originally
a spiral spring, according to the letter of Charles Duryea shown in
fig.&nbsp;17), anchored below to a thin brass finger
extending toward the right
side of the car, and above to a nut screwed tightly onto the shaft. This
nut is also the terminal for the other ignition wire. The action of the
spring keeps the breaker arm and the electrode in constant contact until
the push rod on the end of the piston strikes the arm and separates the
two parts. Breaking contact then produces the ignition spark. Since the
mechanism would spark at the end of both the exhaust and compression
strokes, the battery current is conserved by a contact strip, on the
underside of the larger exhaust-valve gear, by means of which the flow
of current is cut off during the greater part of the cycle.

On the left side of the combustion chamber is bolted the housing
containing the tiny intake valve. A comparatively weak spring seats this
valve in order that the suction created by the piston can easily pull it
open. Clamped onto the valve housing is the intake pipe, enclosing the
choke and carrying the carburetor on its forward side. The choke
consists of two discs which block the pipe, each with four holes at the
edges and one in the center. Turning one disc by means of a small handle
outside, so that the four outer holes cannot coincide with those in the
other disc, decreases the flow of air and causes all air to rush through
the center hole, where the tiny carburetor tube passes through. The
present carburetor was transferred over from the first engine. When
Frank later installed the engine on the carriage he noticed the close
proximity of the intake pipe to the open end of the muffler. Believing
that the fumes might choke the engine, he attached a long sheet-metal
tube to the intake pipe so that fresh air would be drawn in from a point
farther forward on the vehicle.

Moving to the right side of the engine brings the exhaust-valve assembly
into view. This valve is contained in a casting bolted over the exhaust
port in the side of the cylinder, and from the casting a pipe leads to
the muffler underneath. The valve is pushed open by a rod connected to a
crank which is pinned to the lower end of a shaft carrying an iron gear
on top. This gear is in mesh with a fiber gear, keyed to the upper end
of the crankshaft, with half the number of teeth. This ratio permits the
opening of the exhaust valve on every other revolution.

The crankshaft of the first engine was retained for the new engine, thus
giving the two engines the same stroke of 5-&#8540; inches, but the bore was
increased slightly to 4&#8540; inches. With this larger bore and with the
engine speed increased to 500 rpm, Frank rated this engine at
4 hp.[19]
A heavier flywheel, with a governor resting in the upper recess, was
pressed onto the crankshaft. As the operator of the vehicle had no
control over the carburetor once he climbed into the seat, this governor
was necessary to maintain regular engine speed. Its function was to move
a slide on the exhaust-valve unit to prevent the valve from closing.
Thus the engine, with the suction broken, could not draw a charge on the
next revolution. During the recent restoration of this carriage it was
found that while
[17]
most parts are still intact, nearly all of the
governor parts are missing. A description of them must therefore be
based on the recollections of Frank Duryea, along with certain evidences
seen on the engine.



Figure 19.&mdash;Under side
of exhaust valve mechanism showing
electrical contacts that give spark only on every other revolution.


Just on top of the flywheel, and surrounding the crankshaft, rest two
rings, 3&#8542; inches in diameter. Into the opposing surfaces of these
rings are cut a series of small inclined planes, appertinent to each
other. On the outer circumference of the upper ring two pins pass
through a pair of lugs mounted in the flywheel, causing the ring to
rotate with the flywheel, yet permitting vertical movement. Underneath,
the other ring is allowed to turn slightly when, by means of two
connecting links, the arms of the governor push against them. These two
arms, each constructed like a right angle and pivoted at the apex, are
arranged directly opposite each other far out in the flywheel recess. As
a weight on one angle of the arm presses outward by centrifugal force
against a spring, the other angle presses inward against the connecting
link mentioned above. The turning of the lower set of inclined planes
against the fixed set above raises the upper ring and the fork resting
on it. The upward movement of this fork, which is a continuation of an
arm pivoted to a bracket midway between the crankshaft and the slide
carrying the exhaust valve stop, causes the other end of the arm to
drop, pulling the slide down with it. In this manner the closing of the
exhaust valve is blocked, preventing the intake of the next charge, and
therefore the engine misses one or more explosions until it slows to its
normal speed.

A starting shaft is mounted above the engine casting by a cast-iron
bracket on either end. The front end of the shaft has a bevel gear which
is held by a coil spring behind the front bracket, just out of contact
with a bevel gear pressed onto the upper end of the crankshaft. The
short rear portion of the shaft is a tube which slides over the main
shaft. Fitting the removable handcrank to the squared end of the hollow
shaft and turning the crank clockwise, will advance the forward section
of shaft through the medium of a pair of inclined collars. With the
bevel gears now engaged the engine may be cranked. When ignition begins,
the inclined collars slide back down each other's surfaces, the shaft is
again shortened, and its bevel gear springs free of the one on the
crankshaft.

is poured into connecting rod to lubricate wrist pin and crankshaft.


While Frank worked on his engine, he realized that certain parts of the
old running gear would need to be altered or replaced. In view of the
heavier and more powerful engine, he felt the old wheels, probably
having compressed band hubs, were inadequate. He procured a set of new,
heavier wheels[20]
with Warner-type, cast-iron reinforced hubs. The
angle iron frame, apparently sturdy enough to carry the added weight,
was retained, but it was decided to install a heavier rear
axle.[21]
The front axle assembly was at first allowed to remain unchanged, as was the
steering apparatus. A short time later when the engine and friction
transmission were bolted in place on the running gear, Frank saw that
the rigidity of the framework had an undesirable effect. When the
vehicle passed over any unevenness in the shop floor, the framework was
distorted and caused the jackshaft bearings to bind tightly enough on
the shaft to prevent its being turned by hand. In order to provide the
3-point suspension necessary to eliminate this distortion, Frank
attached the forward parts of the framework to an extra wooden spring
bar, installing between this bar and the front axle a vertical fifth
wheel of the type ordinarily used in a horizontal position in any light
carriage.

[18]

Frank next calculated that with the faster running engine the speed of
the vehicle would be about 15 miles an hour, too much for the heavily
loaded wheels. As he intended to make use of the original transmission,
he decided to decrease the speed by increasing the size of the friction
drum. He accomplished this by sliding a heavy fiber tube over the
original drum, bringing its diameter to approximately 14 inches. The
original shipper fork carriage was improved by separating the original
bearings to a greater distance, and eliminating one of the two bearings
on one end. This permitted a smooth and free operation of the small
sliding carriage.

In August 1893, possibly as a result of indoor experiments, Frank
discovered that the chains running from the small
5-tooth[22]
jackshaft
sprockets to the large, bronze, wheel sprockets were tight at some times
and loose at others. This caused considerable unnecessary noise. The
difficulty apparently was the result of the sprockets being cast and not
machined. The patternmaker had said he believed he could make the
pattern accurately enough so that no machining of the castings would be
necessary. Nice castings were produced, but "these sprockets were the
reason why an unusual construction was put on the crankshaft [meaning
jackshaft]," explained Frank Duryea during an interview at the National
Museum on November 9, 1956. Elaborating further, in reply to the queries
of E. A. Battison, of the Museum's division of engineering, Duryea told
of the problem and the solution when he explained that the sprockets had
places where the shrinkage was not even. The hot metal, contracting as
it cooled, did not seem to contract uniformly, creating slightly unequal
distances between teeth. This resulted in the chain hanging quite loose
in some places and in others the tightness prevented adjustment. He
contacted Will Russell, foreman of the Russell shop, where the
automobile was made, and Russell showed him a device, built by George
Warwick, who had made the Warwick bicycle. It was an internal-cut gear,
according to Duryea's description, with sprocket teeth on its periphery.
With sprockets outside and normal teeth inside, the wheels were about 6
inches in diameter, externally.

These little internal-gear sprockets were hung on double-shrouded
pinions secured to each end of the jackshaft. A solid disc or housing
fitted against both ends of the pinion to prevent the internal gear
from working off sideways. Duryea explained the function of these
unique little parts: "as soon as tension came on that ring gear that we
talked about, it not only tightened the chain hanging on this sprocket
on the upper side, but it tightened it on both sides. [The sprocket]
rocks right out: both sides of the chain are tight."

This feature is one rarely encountered elsewhere, and Duryea, later in
the interview said, "To tell you the truth, I think I was just a little
bit ashamed about the thing, because I had to pull it off. I didn't like
the looks of it after I got it on."

Two small tanks, each with a capacity of approximately two gallons, were
mounted over the engine in the positions they still occupy, the one on
the left for
gasoline,[23]
the other for water. The small fitting under
the gasoline tank has a thumbscrew shutoff and a glass-sight feed tube,
leading to the carburetor. The water tank, an inch longer than the
gasoline tank, communicates with the water jacket of the engine through
two pieces of half-inch pipe, entering the jacket from above and below.
The overflow tank, holding just over a gallon, is suspended between the
rear axle and the flywheel.

A number of mufflers were constructed for the
engine.[24]
The first
experimental one was built of wood, being a box 6 &times; 6 &times; 15 inches with a
hole for the exhaust pipe in one end and a series of small holes in the
opposite end. Inside, Frank arranged metal plates which were somewhat
shorter than the depth of the box. Every other one was attached to the
bottom of the box; the intermediate plates were fastened to the top.
This contrivance muffled the sound considerably, but, as might be
expected, soon began to smoke. There can be little doubt that it was
replaced before any of the outdoor trials began. Another type consisted
of a cylindrical metal shell, perhaps six inches in diameter and ten or
twelve inches long. Here a series of perforated baffle plates were
inserted, with alternating solid plates having parts of their external
edges cut away. Two bolts running the length of the muffler held on the
cast-iron heads in a manner quite similar to the Model-T Ford mufflers
of later years. Though partially satisfactory, Frank, in a November 6,
1957, interview, complained that it
[19]
made a metallic sound. Perhaps this
was the muffler he used from September to November 1893.



Figure 21.&mdash;Illustration of
the no. 2 Samson batteryused
by the Duryeas in their vehicle. (Smithsonian photo 46858.)


On August 28 Frank wrote to Charles saying the carriage was almost ready
for the road and that he hoped to take it out for a test on the coming
Saturday, "off somewhere so no one will see
us&#8230;."[25]
There is no
evidence showing whether the amount of remaining work permitted the
proposed trial on September 2. The body was finally replaced on the
running gear, at which time it was found necessary to raise the seat
cushion several inches by the insertion of a framework made of old
crating boards. This allowed sufficient room between the seat and the
frame to suspend the batteries and coil. Six no. 2 Samson batteries were
contained in this space, three on each side, in rows parallel to the
side of the vehicle. The Samson battery consisted of a glass jar
containing a solution of ammonia salts and water, with a carbon rod in
the center, housing a zinc rod. It is difficult to understand why they
used Samson batteries rather than dry cells; perhaps they were concerned
with the mounting cost of the machine and were making use of parts
already on hand.[26]
A coil, possibly from an old gaslight igniter
system, accompanied the Samson batteries under the seat. This original
coil is now missing.

The iron dash frame, previously recovered and provided with a rain apron
to be pulled up over the knees in the event a heavy rain blew in under
the carriage top, was bolted back in place. Frank and Mr. Markham gave
the carriage a quick painting; later Frank admitted, "the machine never
had a good job of
painting."[27]
Before the motor wagon actually got
onto the road, a reporter on the Springfield Evening Union got some
statistics on it and an item appeared on September 16, giving the first
public notice of the machine.

[20]

Springfield Evening Union, September 16, 1893.
Text of Article


Toward the latter part of the following week, Frank was ready to give
the product of his labors its first road trial. On September 21 the
completed carriage was rolled onto the elevator at Russell's shop.
Seeing that the running gear was too long for the elevator, they raised
the front of the machine, resting the entire weight of 750 pounds on the
rear wheels. Once outside the building, they pushed it into an area
between the Russell and Stacy buildings. After dark, "so no one will
see," Will Bemis, Mr. Markham's son-in-law, brought a horse and they
pulled the phaeton out to his barn on Spruce
Street.[28]
There, on
Spruce and Florence Streets the first tests were made. The next day
Frank wrote his brother saying, "Have tried it (the carriage) finally
and thoroughly and quit trying until some changes are made. Belt
transmission very
bad.[29]
Engine all right." He did admit the engine
seemed to be well loaded most of the time. He also had an idea in mind
to replace the poor transmission,
[21]
explaining the plan to Charles: "The
three gears[30]
on secondary shaft have friction clutches, the two bevel
gears on same shaft are controlled by a clutch which frees one and
clutches the other at will. This provides a reverse."



Figure 23.&mdash;Type of
spark coil the Duryeas are believed to have used in
their electrical circuit,as shown in a catalog illustration.
(Smithsonian photo 46858-A.)


The Springfield Evening Union of September 22 carried a notice of the
trial. This report, too, commented on the faulty transmission and the
plan already in Frank's mind for the new transmission.


&#8230; The friction belt allowed of the speed being steadily increased
or diminished at the will of the driver and caused no sudden
forward motion of the carriage, but while this arrangement has many
advantages it uses up the power so that the two-horse power
furnished by the motor [somewhat less than the rating Frank gave
the engine] was reduced to less than three-fourths horse power on
reaching the main shaft. This would not be sufficient to propel the
carriage up steep grades but would be sufficient to run the
carriage on level road.

The inventors will do away with this belt in favor of a clamp gear
and will make the drum wheel smaller. By this means there will be
very little power lost in transmission to the shaft and by a
patented arrangement the carriage may be started gradually but the
speed must be increased by shifting the clamp gear to a succession
of gears on the driving wheel of the motor. The speed of the
carriage will be fixed permanently according to the size of the
gear that the smaller one is shifted to. The test of the machine
with the gear arrangement will be made soon.


In October Frank decided on another vacation and went to Chicago to see
the Columbian Exposition. Charles had come up from Peoria to see the
fair and the two talked over the progress on their motor wagon, and
discussed the transmission problem. They gave particular attention to
everything relating to engines and motor carriages, and Frank recalls
seeing a Daimler quadricycle that impressed him with its
performance.[31]
Just what decisions the two might have made there are
unknown, yet it is likely that they agreed to give the old transmission
one more chance to prove itself.

Returning to Springfield, probably in the first week of November, Frank
gave the friction drive its final test, this time substituting a leather
belt for the rubber one first
used.[32]
Mr. Markham, though intensely
interested in the experiments, apparently was dubious concerning the
safety of the carriage. It had no brakes, and fearing failure of the
transmission on a downgrade, he was reluctant to ride in the machine. On
November 9 he asked Will Bemis to try it for him. The following day the
Springfield Morning Union gave a description of the run:

Residents in the vicinity of Florence street flocked to the windows
yesterday afternoon astonished to see gliding by in the roadway a
common top carriage with no shafts
[22]
and no horse attached. The
vehicle is operated by gasoline and is the invention of Erwin
Markham and J. F. Duryea. It has been previously described in The
Union and the trial yesterday was simply to ascertain the practical
value of a leather friction surface which has been substituted for
the rubber one previously used. The vehicle, which was operated by
Mr. Bemis, started from the corner of Hancock avenue and Spruce
street and went up the avenue, up Hancock street and started down
Florence street, working finely, but when about half-way down the
latter street it stopped short, refusing to move. Investigation
showed that the bearing had been worn smooth by the friction and a
little water sprinkled upon it put it in running condition again.
The rest of the trip was made down Florence and down Spruce street,
to the residence of the inventors. They hope to have the vehicle in
good working condition soon.

The same evening, the late edition ran a brief paragraph stating that
"the test was made to determine the value of a leather friction surface
for propelling the wagon, that had been substituted in place of the
rubber surface, used in the former test." Bemis, according to Frank
Duryea's recollection, was not impressed with the performance of the
machine, saying "the thing is absolutely useless," and for a time it
appeared that further support from Markham would not be forthcoming.
Frank, believing eventual success to be near, drew up plans showing his
geared transmission, and with these managed to gain Markham's partial
support. Money for material and use of the shop was to continue, but
Frank was to complete the work on his own time.

Now receiving no salary, Frank worked hurriedly on the transmission
throughout late November, December, and the first two weeks of January.
First discarding the old friction drum and shaft, and the shipper-fork
carriage, he bolted a rawhide bevel gear to the lower surface of the
flywheel. This turns two bevel gears, in opposite directions, on a
countershaft directly underneath, approximately in the position of the
old jackshaft. The right bevel gear is secured to the main countershaft
on which two clutches are mounted, one on each side of the crankshaft.
On a sleeve turning freely around the countershaft is mounted the
reverse bevel gear and clutch. Three free-running clutch drums, the
right one carrying the high-speed gear, the two on the left carrying the
combination low speed and reverse gear between them, complete the
countershaft
[23]
assembly. The clutch assemblies are of Frank Duryea's
design, having internal arms, expanding outward to press leather-faced
shoes against the inner surface of the drum, thus securing the drum and
its gear to the shaft. Behind this machinery is the jackshaft with its
small differential on the right, two laminated rawhide
gears[33]
meshing with the iron gears of the countershaft, and the internal-gear sprockets
hanging on the small pinions at either end. A sliding cam bar, mounted
nearly in the position of the former shipper-fork carriage, is operated
by the vertical movement of the tiller handle to engage any one of the
three clutches. With the tiller depressed, the vehicle is in reverse.
Elevating it slightly puts it into low gear, and raising it still higher
runs the machine at its highest speed.

As the work moved nearer completion Frank realized that the final tests
would have to be conducted on roads made icy by falling snows. He had
considerable doubt whether the narrow iron tires would have enough
traction to move the phaeton. Soon he devised an expedient for this
situation, communicating to Charles on December 22 that he was "having
Jack Swaine [a local blacksmith] make a couple of clutch rims so we can
get over this snow and ice&#8230;. Our detachable rims referred to will be
of &#8539; iron 1&#190; wide and drawn together at one point by two screws,
one on either side of felloe. It will be studded with calks in two
rows."[34]

Institution before restoration.


January 18, 1894, was a day of triumph for Frank Duryea. Writing Charles
about his success the next day he said, "Took out carriage again last
night and gave it another test about 9 o'clock." The only difficulty he
mentioned was a slight irregularity in the engine, caused by the tiny
leather pad in the exhaust-valve mechanism falling
out.[35]
Speaking of this trip, Frank recalled in 1956:

When I got this car ready to run one night, I took it out and I had
a young fellow with me; I thought I might need him to help push in
case the car didn't work&#8230;. We ran from the area of the shop where
it was built down on Taylor Street. We started out and ran up
Worthington Street
hill,[36]
on top of what you might call "the
Bluff" in Springfield. Then we drove along over level roads from
there to the home of Mr. Markham who lived with his son-in-law,
Will Bemis, and there we refilled this tank with water. [At this
point he was asked if it was pretty well emptied by then.] Yes, I
said in my account of it that when we got up there the water was
boiling furiously. Well, no doubt it was. We refilled it and then
we turned it back and drove down along the Central Street hill and
along Maple, crossed into State Street, dropped down to Dwight,
went west along Dwight to the vicinity where we had a shed that we
could put the car in for the night. During that trip we had run, I
think, just about six miles, maybe a little bit more. That was the
first trip with this vehicle. It was the first trip of anything
more than a few hundred yards that the car had ever made.

[27]




[28]

Now Frank could give demonstration rides with the motor carriage, hoping
to encourage more investors to back future work. Cautious Mr. Markham
finally got his ride, though Frank had to assure him that the engine of
the brakeless vehicle would hold them back on any hill they would
descend. The carriage on which he had spent so many hours was to see
little use after that. Its total mileage is probably less than a hundred
miles. Little additional work is known to have been performed on the
carriage after January 1894; there is, however, a
letter[37]
Frank sent his brother on January 19 which tells of contemplated muffler
improvements. Another message was dispatched to Charles on March 22,
mentioning the good performance of the phaeton on Harrison Avenue
hill.[38]
This was possibly the last run of the machine, for no further
references have been discovered.

Frank spent the months of February and March in preparing drawings, some
of which accompanied their first patent
application,[39]
while others were to be used in the construction of an improved, 2-cylinder
carriage. Work on the new machine started in April. The old phaeton, in the
absence of used-car lots, was put into storage in the Bemis
barn.[40]
Later, on the formation of the Duryea Motor Wagon Company in 1895, it
was removed to the barn of D. A. Reed, treasurer of the
company.[41]
There it remained until 1920, when it was obtained by Inglis M. Uppercu
and presented to the U.S. National Museum.

thickness, but about 1 inch greater diameter i.e., one chamber within
another so as to cause sound to turn corners to get out. Still another
shell will be added if it prove insufficient, making it turn about
again&mdash;taking care in each case to give ample room for expansion&mdash;outer

Frank said the car came back down the hill with no brake,
but that the engine held the vehicle back.

[40]
It is possible that a few parts were removed at this time to be
used on the two-cylinder car. The muffler may have been one of these,
and even more likely, the governor parts. Charles Duryea wrote to C. W.
Mitman December 27, 1921, stating that his younger brother Otho and a
Henry Wells had put in a battery and gasoline in 1897 and started the
engine. Because the chains were not on the car they could not attempt to
operate it; but the engine ran too fast, and finally something broke,
probably the engine frame, found to be broken during the recent
restoration. Charles thought the engine ran too fast because some of the
governor parts were already missing.

approximately a $2000 profit.

24 Nov 1920
Dear Mr Mitman

On the train I had some time to puzzle over that car. Been working
nights to make up time lost in the day so did not hav much.

I made a sketch for you but did not show the spring that holds the
circuit breaker in contact with the spark point. That thin finger was
part of it. A spring was wound spirally--not helically--around the
projecting end of the breaker pivot and the end of the spring hookt over
the thin finger. See sketch herwith.

Just how the central end of the spring wire was fastened to the square
of the pivot I do not kno. We did in some cases bore a hole thru and
simply stick the spring thru but this put most of the action right at
the bend in the wire and it broke quickly. So in other cases we fitted a
light grooved spool or pulley and wound the spring around this and so
avoided a sharp bend. If this was used it has been lost with the spring.
A couple generations of boys playing in that barn was too many.

The Haynes steering sketch also worries me. If that vertical post came
up thru that slot in the floor the crank had to be long as the sketch
shows in order to get over to the driver conveniently. Then if he tried
to make a complete circle with it he could not reach far enuf forward to
do it easily. And he had to make a turn or two be cause H shows bevel
gears of about same size so the post had to make same number of turns
the worm made. Sketch herewith to illustrate my thought.

NO USE FOR HORSES.
Springfield Mechanics Devise a New Mode of Travel.

Ingenious Wagon Now Being Made in This City for Which the Makers Claim
Great Things.

A new motor carriage, which, if the preliminary tests prove successful
as is expected, will revolutionize the mode of travel on highways, and
do away with the horse as a means of transportation, is being made in
this city. It is quite probable that within a short time one may be able
to see an ordinary carriage in almost every respect, running along the
streets or climbing country hills without visible means of propulsion.
The carriage is being built by J. F. Duryea, the designer and B. F.
Markham, who have been at work on it for over a year. The vehicle was
designed by C. E. Duryea, a bicycle manufacturer of Peoria, Ill., and he
communicated his scheme to his brother, who is a practical machanic in
this city.

The propelling power is furnished by a two-horse power gasoline motor
situated near the rear axle and which, when started, runs continuously
to the end of the trip, notwithstanding the number of times the carriage
may be stopped. The speed of the motor is uniform, being about 500
revolutions a minute, and is so arranged that it gives a multiplied
power for climbing hills and the lower the rate of speed the greater
power is furnished by the motor. The slowest that the carriage can be
driven is three miles an hour and the speed can be increased to fourteen
or fifteen miles an hour. The power is transferred from the driving
wheel of the motor, which runs horizontally with the main shaft by an
endless friction belt running on a drum wheel. The belt is controlled by
a lever within easy reach of the driver and is shifted along the drum
wheel to increase or decrease the speed. The driving wheel is about
twenty inches in diameter, having in its center a depression to which
the belt is shifted to stop the carriage.

The carriage can be reversed by shifting the belt from the end of the
drum, which gives the forward motion to the opposite side beyond the
depression in the driving wheel. The power which has been transferred to
the driving shaft from the motor is in turn transferred to the two rear
wheels of the carriage by a combination gear and sprockets. An endless
chain connects the sprockets on the carriage wheels to the sprocket
wheels on the driving shaft. All of the motive power is located under
the body of an ordinary phaeton, the hight of which is not increased by
the machinery. The motor is started by a crank which is easily applied
to a shaft in the rear of the carriage and the gasoline is ignited in
the cylinder by electricity. An automatic device stops the flow of
gasoline into the cylinder when the motor ceases running. The gasoline
is carried in tanks, which hold about two gallons, and which will run
the carriage for about eight hours. The wagon is guided by a bicycle
bar, and the speed is also controlled by this bar.

The method employed in this is as follows: To start the carriage press
the lever down; to reverse it throw the lever up and to guide the wagon
turn the lever either to the right or left. The front axle instead of
turning horizontally plays up and down, in order that the machinery may
be on a level with the rear wheels, while the front wheels are set on
the axle by a pivotal joint and are connected with the guiding lever by
bars with ball bearings. The carriage complete weighs about 220 pounds,
and the essential features are already covered by patents while others
are pending.

It is estimated that the carriages can be sold for about $400, and a
stock company will probably be formed to manufacture them.




Text of Patent Letter (page 24)


United States Patent Office.
CHARLES E. DURYEA, OF PEORIA, ILLINOIS.
ROAD-VEHICLE.
SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 540,648, dated June 11, 1895.
Application filed April 30, 1894. Serial No. 509,466. (No model.)

To all whom it may concern:

Be it known that I, Charles E. Duryea, a citizen of the United States, residing at Peoria,
in the county of Peoria and State of Illinois, have invented new and useful Improvements
in Road-Vehicles, of which the following is a specification.

The object of this invention is to produce a road vehicle which shall be self-propelled, not unduly heavy, simple and easy of control and
comparatively inexpensive, together with such minor objects as will become hereinafter apparent.

The invention more particularly relates to the construction and arrangement of parts for constituting the driving gearing and to the
means for controlling the action thereof; to an improved manner of mounting the front,
or steering, wheels upon the front axle, and of mounting the said axle relative to the running
gear frame, and to the means for effecting the steering; to the appliances for the support
of the motor and driving mechanism in an advantageous and efficient manner, and,
generally, to improved and simplified details of construction throughout the vehicle, all as
will hereinafter be rendered more apparent, and the invention consists in constructions
and combinations of parts, all substantially as will hereinafter fully appear and be set forth in the claims.

Reference is to be had to the accompanying drawings, in which&mdash;

Figure 1 is a sectional elevation from front to rear of the improved road-vehicle.
Fig. 2 is a plan view of the running and driving gear,
the vehicle-body being understood as removed. Fig. 3 is a front
elevation of the vehicle. Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the support and suspension
devices for the driving mechanism. Fig. 5 is a vertical sectional view, longitudinally,
through the shiftable driving-gear, the controlling devices employed in conjunction
with this mechanism being seen in side elevation. Figs.
6 and 7 show the above-mentioned
controlling devices as in operative relations differing the one from the other
and also from that of Fig. 5.

Similar letters of reference indicate corresponding parts in all of the views.

The parts will now be described in detail with reference to said drawings, and A represents the body which is spring supported
on the frame, B, of the running gear. This frame, as shown, is rectangular, and has the body-supporting springs, B2, similar to those
found in common carriages. This frame has, affixed thereto, at its rear ends, sleeves, a, a,
which loosely embrace the rear wheel axle, D, which is the driven axle of the vehicle. The
axle, E, for the front wheels is centrally secured to the running gear frame, B, by the
horizontal king-bolt, b, whereby such axle may have a swinging movement relative to
the frame in a vertical plane, but it has no swinging movement horizontally, the wheels
being swivel-mounted on the ends of this axle peculiarly, as will shortly hereinafter be set forth.

The body, as shown, is in the form of an inverted box, the motor, H, and driving gear
being accommodated within the downwardly opening inclosure constituted thereby, and
the body also has the upwardly open box-like forward extension, or pit, A2, for the accommodation
of the feet of the rider, the rider's seat being constituted by the top forward portion
of the box body. Some other suitable design of body may, of course, be used in lieu of this one shown.

The front wheels, d, d, are hung to the front axle, E, so that the center of each wheel base
is in a line coincident with the axis of the pivotal connection which is provided between the
journals for the wheels and the axle, which arrangement practically destroys any tendency
to deflection from the course that might otherwise arise from striking an obstacle,
and so renders the steering easier. In order to effect this the axle is formed with yoked
ends, the yoke members, f, f, being above and below the longitudinal line of the axle. The
short journal, g, shown for each wheel, has at its inner end an upwardly and downwardly
extended arm, h, which is return-bent to be loosely embraced by the axle yoke, f, f. The
cone pointed screws, c, passed through the yoke members, f, and into sockets therefor in
the arms, h, of the journals, g, constitute the means for the swivel connection between said
parts. The lock-nuts, c2, manifestly, are employed with utility in this connection.

It will be perceived that inasmuch as in the arrangement shown, the pivotal connections

The Borghesi Astronomical Clock
In the Museum of History and Technology



The history of the 18th-century Borghesi astronomical clock is
described here from contemporary source material. The evolution
of its design by Father Francesco Borghesi and the building of
the complex mechanism devised by the clockmaker, Bartolomeo
Antonio Bertolla, is a story of the vision of one man turned
into reality by another. The result of their collaboration is
the unique, astronomical timepiece now in the Museum of History
and Technology.

The Author: Silvio A. Bedini is curator of mechanical and
civil engineering in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of
History and Technology.


&ldquo;&#8230; All this work I had performed eagerly,
so that, while in my room, I might contemplate leisurely, both during
the day and in the night, the true face of the heavens and of the seas
unobscured by clouds, even though I had no astronomical
equipment.&rdquo;
[1]

With
these words, Father Francesco Borghesi (1723-1802) of Mechel
described the reasons which inspired him to invent a unique astronomical
clock which is now in the horological collection of the Museum of
History and Technology.

This complicated mechanism, which performs a multitude of functions, was
designed by Father Francesco Borghesi, a secular priest in Venezia
Tridentina. It was constructed in 1764 under his direction by a
provincial clockmaker named Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla (1702-1789) of
Mocenigo di Rumo. It was the second of two complicated astronomical
clocks which Father Borghesi designed and which Bertolla constructed.
According to contemporary sources, this clock was presented to the
Empress Maria Theresa of Austria soon after its completion.

[32]

Its history is rather hazy, except for the fact that in 1780 this second
Borghesi timepiece was still in the Imperial Palace in Vienna. The clock
was again noted in 1927 when it was sold at a public auction in New
York.
[2] Subsequently, it was
acquired for the Smithsonian Institution.

Development of Astronomical Clocks


The history of the great theoretical and mechanical achievement which
the Borghesi clock represents has been most adequately covered
elsewhere.[3]
Consideration of the development of equation and
astronomical clocks is required here only for the purpose of relating
the Borghesi timepiece with the other significant developments in this
branch of horology.

The invention of the anchor escapement in about 1670, and the consequent
greater accuracy in time-telling, led to increased preoccupation with
precision. Daily differences in time as recorded by sundials and clocks
became more noticeable. Finally, in the second half of the 17th century,
some attempt was made to construct mechanical clocks combined with
sundials as well as astronomical clocks.

With the improvement of precision time-telling, it became necessary to
reconcile the actual difference between true and mean time. Although a
great variety of time-equation tables were produced, there was a
considerable margin for error in their use. This led to the construction
of mechanical clocks in which the equation of time was automatically
accomplished. A few were produced late in the 17th and early 18th
century at considerable cost and, consequently, with little popularity.
Equation sundials were also developed which were elaborately ingenious,
but they were not completely practical. Inevitably, they were supplanted
by the mechanical equation clock.

Probably the first documented mention of an equation clock is in the
diary of John Evelyn who recorded that in 1666 he visited the Royal
Society where he witnessed a curious clock, which showed the equation of
time, being presented by a certain Mercator. More data on the subject
appeared in the first two decades of the 18th century, when Henry Sully,
Joseph Williamson, Daniel Quare, and Thomas Tompion&mdash;who were among the
foremost English clockmakers of all time&mdash;produced elaborate examples of
these timepieces. Another significant maker was Dowe Williamson, who
became Court Clockmaker to Emperor Charles VI of Austria. In London,
Joseph Williamson produced some of the finest astronomical timepieces of
this type that have been known. The interest in the subject next shifted
to France where many fine examples were produced during the first half
of the 18th century.

Just after the middle of the 18th century, the subject of astronomical
clocks suddenly became a major horological preoccupation in another
region, namely, Austria, where the work in this field was apparently
done exclusively by members of the clergy. The earliest was Father
Philipp MatthÃ¤us Hahn (1739-1790) of
WÃ¼rttemberg.
[4] Father Hahn
considered the equation of time as only one part of a plan to represent
astronomical occurrences by means of clockwork. In addition to
planetaria and similar mechanisms, Father Hahn produced two
extraordinary astronomical, tall-case clocks, both of which survive in
public museums.

[33]

and Technology.


Another of the clerical clockmakers was Father Aurelianus Ã  San Daniele
(1728-1782), an Augustine monk in the monastery of the Imperial Court at
Vienna.[5]
His four complicated astronomical clocks, which exist in
museums at present, are comparable to those produced by Father Hahn. The
third cleric was Brother David Ã  San Cajetano (1736-1796) in the same
Augustine order to which Father Aurelianus belonged. He achieved note as
the author of various publications, including Neue
RÃ¤dergebÃ¤ude
[6]
[New Construction of Wheels] relating to planet-wheels, or gear-trains
containing epicyclic elements. He constructed a clock based on an
elaborate astronomical design which was substantially different from the
others. The fourth of the ecclesiasts who designed astronomical clocks
in this period was Father Klein of Prague, who produced a complicated
astronomical timepiece in about 1738.

The fact that such important and outstanding examples of astronomical
clocks were produced exclusively by ecclesiasts in Austria during the
second half of the 18th century is especially significant. It is
particularly so when a fifth cleric is added to the group, also an
Austrian subject although Italian by heritage, in the person of Father
Francesco Borghesi.

Although only Father Borghesi's second astronomical clock is now known,
it is apparent that this example in the Museum of History and Technology
represents an experiment in astronomical time-telling comparable to any
of the timepieces produced by Father Hahn, Father Aurelianus, Brother
David Ã  San Cajetano or Father Klein.

This combination of five clerical clockmakers who lived in the same
region during the same period of time is sufficiently unusual. However,
the fact that each of them apparently worked without association with
any of the others leads to the conjecture that a common factor must have
led them to their individual preoccupation with astronomical horology.
What the link may have been is not apparent from the surviving records
of the lives and works of these clerics. Certainly it was not an
interest in astronomy or clockmaking per se, because other than the
astronomical clocks, none of these horological inventors&mdash;with the
possible exception of Father Hahn&mdash;worked in any other aspect of the
fields of astronomy or horology. However, after a comprehensive study of
Father Borghesi's writings, there is little doubt of the religious basis
of his own inspiration.





Designer Borghesi


Father Borghesi's story takes place in the picturesque mountainous
region of what was then known as Venezia Tridentina (since 1947,
Trentino-Alto Adige) in northern Italy, along the Tyrolean border of
Austria. Because of its strategic position as the passage between
Innsbruck and Verona, the possession of the Tridentina was contested
again and again in the European wars, but during Father Borghesi's
lifetime, the Tridentina was under Austrian domination.

[34]




Figure 3.&mdash;Panorama of the village of Mechel in the
valley of the Non, birthplace of Father Borghesi.


Deep within this mountainous district is the romantic valley of the Non,
or AnÃ¡uni, with its great forests and ancient castles. Most maps do not
mark it, and the tourist guides ignore it.
[7] One of the chief
communities is Cles, with its historic Renaissance buildings. The major
city of the region is Trent on the Adige River, with its surviving Roman
relics and Romanesque and Renaissance architecture.

The little villages scattered throughout the valley of the Non played no
part in history, but such names as Mechel and Mocenigo di Rumo reflect
the interchange of sovereignty. It was in the little village of Mechel
that Francesco Borghesi was born in 1723.
[8] Local records are meager
and inadequate, and many of the details of Borghesi's life must be
assumed. Inasmuch as the village was in a rural, agricultural district,
Borghesi may have come from a family of farmers, vintners, or village
tradesmen. Borghesi sought an education by entering the priesthood and
was ordained a secular priest in Salzburg. He was first assigned as
curate to the village parish of Rumo in the valley of the Non, a short
distance from his birthplace.
[9] Later, he was transferred to his native
Mechel. He was inherently a man of simple tastes and of great piety. He
tended to the needs of his mountain villagers and attended the births,
weddings and deaths of his parishioners. It was during his assignment in
this tiny community that Father Borghesi met and became friendly with
the clockmaker, Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla of nearby Mocenigo di Rumo.





Clockmaker Bertolla


Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla was born in Mocenigo di Rumo, a short
distance from Mechel, in 1702.
[10] Nothing is known of his boyhood,
other than the fact that he was mechanically inclined. At the age of 17
he was apprenticed to become a clockmaker with the master, Johann Georg
ButzjÃ¤ger of Neulengbach, a small village on the edge of the great
Vienna woods.
[11] This region was then part of the domain of the
Archduke of Austria, of which Sankt PÃ¶lten was the capital.

[35]

legible, indicating that the portrait may have been painted after
Bertolla&#39;s death on January 15, 1789. Translated, it states: "Bartolomeo

Instruments. Repairer of the clocks of Venice, Verona, Trent, and other
localities. Maker of the Work which combines the Copernican and
Ptolemaic Systems devised by Father Francesco Borghesi of Mechel,
Laureate Mathematician, and humbly offered to Her Imperial Majesty Maria
Theresa. Died in piety in his home at Rumo on 15 January 1789 at the age
of 86." (Courtesy of Sig. Luigi Pippa of Milan.)

Figure 6.&mdash;Certificate of apprenticeship awarded to
Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla upon completion of his 3-year apprenticeship
at Neulengbach, dated December 27, 1722.


Bertolla began his apprenticeship with ButzjÃ¤ger under the auspices of
the Corporation of Blacksmiths of Sankt PÃ¶lten in 1719. His training was
supervised by two master locksmiths, Johann Christian Winz and Peter
Wisshofer, who were members of the Corporation, and were assigned to
serve as patrons for the apprentice. It was their obligation to make
certain that he received good care and adequate instruction from his
master. While he worked in ButzjÃ¤ger's shop, Bertolla lived with the
master's family in their home.

Bertolla's 3 years at Neulengbach passed quickly as he sought to absorb
all that his master could teach him. ButzjÃ¤ger was considered to be a
good craftsman in the region, yet today there is not even a mention of
his name in the lists of clockmakers. He specialized in the production
and repair of "great clocks" which included tall-case, domestic
timepieces, and tower clocks. ButzjÃ¤ger treated his apprentice well, and
in return Bertolla rewarded him by being diligent and honest. His
subsequent work is sufficient indication that he developed into an
extremely skilled craftsman, and he became the equal of any clockmaker
of his time.

The 3 years of apprenticeship were completed and
[37]
on December 27, 1722,
Bertolla received a certificate from the Corporation of Blacksmiths
which assured whomever it might concern of Bertolla's skill, diligence
and honesty, and permitted him to open his own shop as a clockmaker
under the auspices of the Corporation. This document, which has been
preserved by Bertolla's descendants, is an interesting record of the
organization of the trade guilds in the 18th century, and, for that
reason, has been translated from the original German:

We, the Superiors and other masters of the honorable
corporation of municipal blacksmiths, armorers, and of smiths,
in the Imperial City of St. PÃ¶lten in Austria by the river
Enns, Declare by these Presents put in force by this document
to anyone who waits to hear&#8230;. That the honorable and able
Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla of Rumo in Lentzberg, the Tyrol, on
the 27th day of the month of December of the year 1719 was
consigned as apprentice for three years, in the presence of two
sponsoring masters for the purpose, the honorable Johann
Christian Winz and Peter Wisshofer, both of them master
locksmiths representing the entire honorable Corporation and
others of open shop&mdash;to the honorable Johann Georg ButzjÃ¤ger,
incorporated with us, citizen and master clockmaker for large
clocks in the merchant-village of Neulengbach in Wienerwald, as
his master of the art, would have therefore perfectly and
rightfully worked and learned, and

that afterwards, on the day and year noted at the bottom, he
will be newly declared free and independent before us,
representative of an entire and honorable Corporation and with
open shop, of his above-mentioned master and of the two
sponsoring masters mentioned,

and since he eagerly requested a truthful certificate of
apprenticeship for his honest service as an apprentice and for
his good behavior, and we having great pleasure as well as the
duty of favoring the truth and well knowing that the aforesaid
Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla has learned honestly the art of
clockmaking for great clocks from his aforesaid master, and
that he has always behaved with honesty, obedience,
faithfulness and diligence both towards his master and towards
us to our complete satisfaction and, therefore, we cannot in
any manner refuse his request, rather we wish to grant it with
a clear conscience.

We Therefore Address to Everyone and to anyone in whatever
state and rank, but particularly to those interested in our
branch of this art, our respectful and courteous entreaty and
request to consider Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla well
recommended for his honest apprenticeship and his good
behavior, and to desire to favor him in every way, in such a
manner that will assure our gratitude whenever an occasion
presents itself.

For this purpose, we issue, as we have declared we wish to
issue to you, Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla,
this certificate of apprenticeship, attaching to it the seal of
our Corporation.

Executed in the city of St. PÃ¶lten on 27 December
1722.
[12]

His apprenticeship over, Bertolla returned to his native region where he
soon established a reputation for himself as one of the most skillful
clockmakers in the Tridentina and produced timepieces of fine quality in
some quantity. No records have survived concerning his personal life,
but it is believed that he married probably soon after his return. He
had no children of his own. To expand his business, he eventually took
into his shop two nephews, the sons of a brother and a sister, as
apprentices.

Bertolla's work brought him a sufficient number of clients, and he
produced elaborate clocks for his more wealthy patrons.

In 1752, it is recorded that he repaired the great clock in the
campanile of the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Cles,
the regional capital of the valley of the Non. The clock dated probably
from the 16th century, and it seems likely that Bertolla replaced the
original two-wheel train with a three-wheel movement, and that he added
the present anchor escapement.
[13]

It is not possible to determine when Father Borghesi first made
Bertolla's acquaintance, but it may be assumed that they had become
friends in the late 1750's.

After he had come to know Bertolla, Father Borghesi apparently spent
many hours in the clockmaker's shop. He was fascinated by mechanics in
any form, and the complications of clockwork particularly intrigued him.
Bertolla was patient with the young priest, explaining the tools he had
and their uses, the clocks he produced or repaired, and the principles
which were involved. Father Borghesi listened willingly and as his
understanding of timepieces grew, his curiosity increased.

In spite of himself, the priest could not be satisfied with the ordinary
aspects of his friend's work and wanted to learn more. From a casual
pastime, the study of time became an obsession with him. There was but
one recourse: he went back to studying once again. This time it was not
theology, however, but the sciences. Every moment he could spare went
into the perusal of books on mathematics, astronomy, and
[38]
associated subjects. He progressed rapidly, driven by his overpowering interest and
aided by his quick intellect.

Little by little, Borghesi managed to acquire the basic texts that
explained this new world to him, probably borrowing them from old
seminary friends. As each new book came into his hands, he devoured it
in his desire to master its contents. He discussed each new principle or
precept that he learned with Bertolla. Together, they attempted to apply
his new learning to the calculations necessary for a timepiece which
would demonstrate the astronomical theories in visual form. Borghesi
taught himself slowly, step by step, and the result was a profound
understanding of astronomical science. He conceived the project of
constructing a great astronomical clock which he felt could be
accomplished by combining Bertolla's mechanical skills with his own
recent mastery of astronomy and mathematics.





First Borghesi Clock

It is not difficult to visualize the two men, the priest and the
clockmaker, as they sat together night after night working out their
plans. Father Borghesi would painstakingly outline the astronomical
principles he wished to have the clock exhibit and the mathematical
principles which would be involved to operate them. Bertolla
concentrated on them and tried to transcribe the principles into
functional mechanical terms, visualizing each operation in terms of
wheels and gears. Little by little the two men coordinated the numerous
elements and welded them into an operating entity. They adjourned either
to the stark simplicity of the rectory or, probably more often, to
Bertolla's little home workshop, the priest standing over his friend
while the latter worked at his bench in the dark paneled interior
illuminated only by the several lamps on the work benches.

This first clock which the two men combined to create is a monument to
the great scientific knowledge of the self-taught priest and the
technical ability of the clockmaker&mdash;a unity combining astronomical
science, mechanics, and artistry. The story of the project is told in a
little book, Novissima Ac Perpetua Astronomica&#8230;, which Borghesi
later published. Explaining the incentive which inspired him, and the
premises from which he began his work, he wrote:


From the foundation of astronomical science long ago,
innumerable [and] repeated observations of both ancient and
modern astronomers, emerged at last from their hiding places.
Made light of by the jests of so many outstanding intellects,
they have so successfully brought to light the paths of the
stars and their motions, which are more complicated to us than
the Gordian knots. Now it is possible for even an amateur in
astronomy, sufficiently instructed, to predict for any given
time not only the mean position of the planets, but also their
true longitude and latitude, and even the true time of their
conjunctions, and their ecliptic oppositions, with all the
attendant circumstances. Yet, until now, no hypothesis has been
devised which would force an automaton to show to us, before
our very eyes, the eclipses of the planets in their true and
certain times.

For though there have been men seeking with all their might to
bind by laws their artificial heavens, by I know not how many
and how great calculations, and to systematize the complexities
of the rotations of celestial bodies; nevertheless, all of
them, as if by common agreement, considered themselves to have
made great contributions to mechanico-theoretical astronomy.
However, they have only attained, even though closely, the mean
locations of the secondary mobiles, and those by a certain
rather crude calculation. Some attained by more, some by less,
but all by some degree of wandering from the truth, either worn
out by the intricacies of the motions, or deceived and
deceiving by the errors of their calculations. This fact those
well know, who, setting about to collect information of this
kind, even those publicized not long ago, with true
astronomical calculation, have been bored to death while
digging out by the most elementary and superficial arithmetical
torture, the worst of fallacies spontaneously erupting from
thence.

It would seem that true calculations alone can be desired in
mechanico-astronomics. Long study had not only convinced me
that an automaton was within the realm of possibility, but that
there were many mechanical systems by which it could be
achieved. I girded myself for a new project and developed it
theoretically from the ground up, but under such unhappy
auspices that not only did all hope fail that anyone would ever
appear who might have seemed willing to set his hand to the
work, but that the new discovery itself was scoffed at by many
as altogether a nightmarish delirium of an unbridled
imagination.


The first months of the project must have seemed like an inspired dream
to the two men, and then must have followed a period of hopeless
depression. Bertolla undoubtedly felt many times that the clock was an
aspiration far beyond their combined abilities and means, but the priest
would not be thwarted in his ambition and refused to abandon the
project. He felt that it was a work that they were destined to produce.
[39]
Many times, he wrote, he chided and begged and shamed his erstwhile
partner into resuming the project where it had been last abandoned.
Little by little, the first clock began to take form. As each new
difficulty was encountered, the two men would go back over the notes and
sketches to trace the problem to its source. Often a new part of the
mechanism would nullify another which had thus far operated
successfully, and a complete rearrangement would be required.







Figure 7.&mdash;Title
Page of Father Borghesi's first book.
The translation in its entirety is: "The Most Recent, Perpetual,
Astronomical Calendar Clock: Theoretical&mdash;Practical: by means of which
besides the hours, the minutes and seconds; the current year, the month;
the day of the month and the day of the week; the dominical letter,
epact, and thence, the day of all the feastdays, both fixed and movable;
the solar cycle; the golden number; the Roman indiction; the dominant
planet of any year and its sign; the phases of the moon and its mean
age: and all the motions of the sun and the moon as to longitude,
latitude, eccentricity, etc., are immediately seen, so accurately that
[not only] the true new full moons and the true quadrature, etc., of the
sun and moon appear, but also, all solar and lunar eclipses&mdash;both
visible and invisible; as in heaven, so on the clock, they are
conspicuously celebrated in their true times, and those of the past and
those of the future, with their circumstances of time and duration,
magnitude, etc., can be quickly determined. All this was devised and
brought to light by the author, Francesco Borghesi of AnÃ¡uni, a secular
priest of Trent, A.A.L.L. &amp; Doctor of Philosophy. (Trent: From the
printshop of Giovanni Battista Monauni, With Permission of Superiors.)"
(Title page reproduced by permission of the Biblioteca della Citta di
Trento.)


Again and again, Bertolla threw up his hands in despair and begged
Father Borghesi to abandon the enterprise. He protested that he was not
capable of producing such a complicated mechanism; he had neither the
tools nor the skill. The priest wished to produce a clock such as the
world had never seen before, such as the greatest scientists and
clockmakers of all time had never been able to make. But Bertolla felt
that he was only a provincial craftsman who could not hope to surpass
them all with only his simple tools and training.

In his book on the first clock, Novissima Ac Perpetua Astronomica&#8230;,
Father Borghesi wrote that when he had finally come within a few weeks
of the embryo stage in the development of his clock, he was faced with
the problem of bolstering the sagging enthusiasm of Bertolla. The
clockmaker's original enthusiasm had shown promise of great results, but
as the days passed and the problems of the multiplex and generally
unfamiliar apparatus to be forged for the workings of the automaton
became more complex, his ardor decreased. Finally, Bertolla became so
discouraged by the scoffers and frustrated by the fact that the work was
insufficiently organized that Father Borghesi
[40]
wrote that "it almost
became a harder task for me to bolster up by daily opportunity and
importunity the failing patience of the artisan, frightened away from
the work already begun, than it was for me to extract from the inner
recesses of mathematics and astronomy, without light and without a
guide, the whole fabric of the machine itself!"

In spite of Bertolla's protests, Father Borghesi prevailed, reviving his
friend's interest once more until the two were deep in the project
again. Months passed as they worked together on the mechanism and it
seemed as if they lived for no other purpose. Inevitably, Bertolla's
health began to suffer, undermined as it was by the constant nervous
tension, and he eventually became ill from mental strain. He was forced
to spend some time in bed, and for many weeks the subject of the clock
was not discussed. Bertolla's other work, by which he made his living,
suffered and it was several months before he was able to return to his
little shop.

One year passed into another and the work progressed slowly. The first
clock, which easily should have been finished in less than a year, was
not completed until after three full years had passed. However, when the
priest and the clockmaker put the finishing touches to their great
clock, the result surpassed the greatest possible expectations, for it
was truly a masterpiece. Not only did it illustrate the ecliptic
phenomena of the moon, the sun and earth occurring in their proper time,
as well as many other things, but it showed these operations as they
succeeded in proper order, taking place through the centuries.

With mutual feelings of great pride, the two friends surveyed the result
of their three years of endeavor. Bertolla realized that he had reached
a point of maximum achievement in his work. He probably felt that now he
could relax again, that his sleep would no longer be troubled by
confused nightmares of wheels and gears that did not mesh together. Time
was to prove otherwise.


PUBLISHED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST CLOCK

Father Borghesi soon came to the conclusion that it would be desirable
to have a written description to explain the mechanism of the clock and
its many indicators. He thereupon wrote out the story of how the clock
was made, the reasons for embarking on the enterprise, the difficulties
he had encountered, and the success which had crowned his and Bertolla's
mutual labors. Finally, he described the operation of the clock's
mechanism and the functions of its array of indicators.

The little book was written in Latin and only a few copies were printed,
presumably at the priest's own expense, on a handpress by Giovanni
Battista Monauni, printer to the Bishop in Trent. The little volume was
stated by contemporary writers to have been published in 1763, although
no date appears on the title page. The title translated is, in part,
The Most Recent, Perpetual Astronomical Calendar Clock,
Theoretical&mdash;Practical&#8230;. The work begins with an introduction for the
reader in which Father Borghesi stated that:


&#8230; the little work, which, as far as I was concerned could
easily have been finished in a year, was only completed after
about three years. Fortunately, however, it was so far beyond
the expectations of most, that not only am I able to foretell
with certainty all the lunar ecliptic phenomena and the solar,
or rather terrestrial, phenomena, carefully worked out in their
true periods, among many other matters exhibited by the
machine; but also, within a few hours, I can exhibit by
altogether tangible evidence to the skeptics and the doubting
those very same phenomena, occurring within the space of many
years, or even centuries, and succeeding one another in proper
order, with their many attendant circumstances. I was not much
concerned about the other eclipses, such as those of Mercury,
Venus, and the other stars wandering through the zodiac, or
about the other solar eclipses from the transit of Mercury or
Venus, since they are altogether undiscernible to the naked
eye, and very few compilers of ephemerides wish them to be
noted, probably for the same reason.

Do not, however, expect, star-loving reader, that here anything
at all that you may wish can be drawn forth as from its source,
for to demand this would be almost the same as to seek to drain
as from a cup all the vast knowledge of the many arithmetical
sciences from the narrow confines of one book. You will
understand how impossible that is when, through prolonged
labor, you have grown somewhat more mature in this kind of
learning.

Wherefore, rather fully, and out of consideration for you, I
have decided, setting aside these prolixities, with completely
synoptic brevity and with all possible clarity to expound for
you simply the proportion of the movements, the description of
the machine, and its usage. As a result, when you have
progressed a little in theoretical mechanics, you will not only
be able to reduce all these things to their astronomical
principles, but you may find the way more smoothly laid out for
you even for perfecting the machine itself. And, thus, you may be
[41]
more effectively encouraged to a successful conclusion. Let
it be so now for you through the following 10 chapters!


After these rather hopeful assurances, Father Borghesi proceeded to
provide a detailed description of the clock dial and functions in the 10
short chapters which he had promised, under a separate section entitled
"Synopsis Totius Operis Mechanici," which is translated in its entirety
in the appendix.

As Father Borghesi prepared his little volume about his first clock, and
described its unusual features and outlined its functions, which were
primarily to place in evidence the celestial constellations, it occurred
to him that it would now be easier after the experience he had acquired
with his first timepiece, to construct another clock, which would
present the motions of the two astronomical systems, the Ptolemaic and
the Copernican. In this first book, he promised the reader that he would
undertake the second project. It is fortunate that Father Borghesi
undertook this project for the second clock is the only example of his
work that is known to exist today. Extensive research has not shown what
happened to the first clock, although several sources state that both
timepieces were presented to Empress Maria Theresa sometime between 1764
and 1780.





Second Borghesi Clock





Figure 8.&mdash;The Borghesi clock in the Museum of History
and Technology, constructed in 1764 by Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla of
Mocenigo di Rumo from the designs of Father Francesco Borghesi of Rumo
and Mechel.


Father Borghesi lost no time in initiating the project of the second
clock. The first and most important step was to inform Bertolla and
enlist his assistance. Bertolla was adamant: he had had enough of
complicated astronomical movements. He was delighted by the prospect of
returning to his former simple life, producing simple, domestic,
elementary movements for his country clients. Father Borghesi begged and
cajoled. The second clock would be a much simpler one to construct, he
persisted. After all, they had gained invaluable experience from the
production of the first clock. Furthermore, he had already completed its
design.

Bertolla apparently wavered in his resolve and, unwillingly and against
his better judgment, he allowed the priest's inducements to prevail.
Once again, the two friends yielded their leisure hours to a study of
the priest's books and drawings as Father Borghesi enthusiastically
elaborated his design for the timepiece, and Bertolla attempted to
transcribe astronomical indications into terms of wheel counts. The
second clock was, as Borghesi had promised, much easier of execution.
Within a year, it was completed and functioned with complete success.

[42]




Figure 9.&mdash;Another
view of the Borghesi clock.


This is the clock now in the Museum of History and Technology. It is
housed in a tall case of dark-red mahogany veneered on oak, with
restrained carving featuring ribands and foliate motifs. Gilt-brass
decorations flank the face of the hood, which is surmounted by three
gilt-brass finials in the form of orbs. A wide door in the waist may be
opened to attend the weights. The case is 7 feet 8 inches high, 201/2
inches wide at the waist, and 14 inches in depth.

The dial is of gilt brass, measuring 21 inches high and 15 inches in
width, with a number of supplementary silvered dials visible through its
openings. Instead of hands, the dial utilizes three concentric rings
moving around a central disc, the indications of which are read at two
bisecting gilt lines inscribed in the glass face. Twelve separate
functions are performed by the chapter ring assembly alone, and there
are 14 openings on the dial. It is estimated that the clock performs 30
separate functions, including striking and chiming. Of the multiple
chapter rings, the outermost is 11/8 inches wide, the center ring is
3/8 inch wide, and the innermost ring measures
11/4 inches in width.


THE DIAL-PLATE ENGRAVINGS

The gilt dial is incised throughout with figures and inscriptions in
engraving of the very finest quality, as is evidenced in the
illustrations. The frontispiece is surmounted at its center by the
crowned double eagle of the House of Hapsburg, indicating the identity
of the sovereign in whose reign it was made, Emperor Francis I or the
Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Below the eagle at either side are
flying cherubs supporting ribands with inscriptions. Centered at the
bottom of the frontispiece immediately above the chapter rings is the
moving silvered orb representing the sun. Surrounding it is a tableau of
the Holy Trinity, with the Virgin Mary being crowned by Christ holding a
cross at the left and God with a sword in hand at the right, and a dove
representing the Holy Spirit hovering over the Virgin's head. Father S.
X. Winters, S.J., considers it reminiscent of the triptych "The
Coronation of the Virgin" by Fra Lippo Lippi.

In the upper spandrels of the dial are two more cherubs bearing ribands
with inscriptions. In the lower left corner is a magnificent engraving
of Atlas upholding the globe of the world, inscribed with the zodiac,
over his head. The lower right corner features the figures of two
noblemen apparently examining and discussing an orb upon a table, the
significance of which is not clear.

THE INSCRIPTIONS

Beginning with the uppermost part of the frontispiece, there are nine
inscriptions in Latin on the dial plate. The topmost is Franciscvs I
sit plan. Dominator aeternvs. The phrase has reference to Francis I,
who was Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, from 1745-1765, and husband of
Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The phrase may be translated as "May
Francis I be the eternal ruler by favor of the planets" or more simply
"Long Live Francis I, Emperor."
[14] Although the dial plate of the
Borghesi clock is inscribed with his name, the records indicate that
the clock was presented to Maria Theresa. Francis I may have already
died before the presentation was made.

From the left to right over the tableau of the Holy Trinity is the
phrase "Lavs sacrosanctae Triadi Vni Deo, et Deiparae" (Praise [be] to
the most Holy Trinity, to the one God, and to the Mother of God).

Within the upper left and right spandrels is inscribed:


Isthaec, Signum grande apparvit in Coelo * sancta Dei genitrix
amicta sole * Illibato pede Lvnae et serpentis nigra premens
Cornva * bis senis pvlcherrime Coronata syderibvs * Tempe
indesinenter clavsa, scatvrigo signata * Cedrvs in Libano,
Cypresvs in Monte Sion * Mater pvrae Dilectionis sanctaeqve
spei * Chara patris aeterni proles, Verbi Mater, sponsaqve
procedentis *, gratiae et gloriae circvmdata varietate.


[45]

This inscription is a eulogy to the Virgin Mary assembled from the texts
of Holy Scripture. In addition, each lemma, contained within
asterisks, carries out the chronogram 1764, the year the clock was
completed. Each lemma is translated and identified from the
Douay-Rheims version of the Bible:


This woman: a great sign appeared in Heaven (Apocalypse 12:1) *
The Holy Mother of God clothed with the sun (Apocalypse 12:1) *
And with unharmed foot crushing the black horns of the moon
(Apocalypse 12:1) and the serpent (Genesis 3:15) * Most
beautifully crowned with twice-six (Apocalypse 12:1) * A garden
[Tempe
[15]] enclosed, sealed
with a fountain [spring of
water] (Song of Songs 4:12) * Like a cedar in Lebanon, and a
cypress tree on Mount Zion; (Ecclesiasticus 24:17) * Mother of
pure love and of holy hope: Beloved daughter of the Eternal
Father, Mother of the Word, Spouse of the Holy Spirit:
(Ecclesiasticus 24:24) * Surrounded with a diversity of grace
and glory (Psalms 44:10).

Avdaces Trepidos Fortvna Repellet." (Fortune favors the daring and

Figure 15.&mdash;The bottom
left corner of the dial plate, showing the engraving of Atlas,
with the inscription "Assidvo proni donant di cvncta labori."

At the lower left corner below the figure of Atlas upholding the world
is the phrase, Assidvo proni donant di cvncta labori. (The favorable
gods willingly grant all things to the assiduous laborer.) The same
phrase is quoted by Father Borghesi in the text of his second volume.
The last inscription appears at the lower right corner under the figures
of the two noblemen, Diligit avdaces trepidos fortvna repellet.
(Fortune favors the daring and rejects the timid.) The last two
inscriptions are in dactylic hexameter. They appear to be original
compositions inasmuch as no classical prototypes have been identified.

CENTER DIAL INSCRIPTIONS

In addition to the inscriptions previously noted on the outer dial
plate, there are three major inscriptions in the central dial. The
outermost states Circulus horarius Soli, Lunae, Fixis, Nodis,
Aestuique marino communis (the hour circle, common to the sun, the
moon, the fixed stars, the nodes and to the sea tide). This inscription
is divided into four parts by the insertion of four divisions for the
day into canonical hours: [Horae] Nocturnae (night hours);
Matutinae (morning hours); Diurnae (daytime hours) and Vespertinae
(evening hours).

The next section of the central dial is inscribed
Intumescite&mdash;Detumescite (rise and fall of the tides) repeated at
intervals of approximately every six hours. Within the next section is
the following inscription, inscribed continuously around the ring:

Lege fluunt, refluunt, dormitant hac maris undae:
Ad Phoebi et Phoebes concordia iussa moventur Aequora; discordi iussu
suspensa quiescunt.

Translated, this is:

By this law the sea waves ebb and flow and lie
dormant: When Phoebus and Diana agree in their commands, the waters are
moved; when they disagree, the waters lie
silent.
[16]

Within the central boss of the dial plate, the name of the maker is
inscribed:

Bvrghesio Doctore, et Bertolla Limatore Annaniensibvs*

Translated, this is:

[By] Doctor Borghesi and Bertolla, mechanician
citizens of AnÃ¡uni.


INDICATORS IN THE FRONTISPIECE

There are 12 windows in the frontispiece, through each of which appears
an indication relating to time. Beginning at the top of the frontispiece
of the dial, the first opening occurs on the breast of the imperial
eagle. This indicates the dominating planet, represented by its symbol,
and its house.

The opening in the eagle's left claw, labeled "Lit. Dom." is the
dominical letter. The first seven days in the month of January are each
assigned one of the letters a through g in order of appearance. The
letter which coincides with the first Sunday within this period is
called the dominical letter, and it serves for the following year. In
leap year, two letters are required, one to February 29th and the letter
next proceeding for the remainder of the year. This letter is used in
connection with establishing the date of Easter Sunday. The date of
Easter regulates the dates of the other movable feasts.

The eagle's right claw is labeled "Cyc. EpEC" and represents the epact,
or the age of the moon on January 1st. It serves to find the moon's age
by indicating the number of days to be added to each lunar year in order
to complete a solar year. Twelve lunar months are nearly 11 days short
of the solar year, so that the new moons in one year fall 11 days
earlier than they did the preceding year. However, 30 days are deducted
as an intercalary month since the moon has made a revolution in that
time, and the remainder, 3, would be the epact.

Below the imperial eagle two winged cherubs support a riband with three
indictions of the Julian period. This period of 7980 years is the
product derived from multiplying together the sums of 28, which
represents the cycle of the sun; 19, representing the cycle of the moon;
and 15, which represents the Roman indiction. The Julian period is
reckoned to have begun from 4713 B.C. so that the period will be
completed in A.D. 3267. The first of the three openings is marked "Ind.
Rom." or "Roman indiction," which was an edict by the Emperor
Constantine in A.D. 312, providing for the assessment of a property tax
at the beginning of each 15-year cycle. It continues to be used in
ecclesiastical contracts. The second opening, which occurs immediately
below the eagle, is marked "Cyc. Sol." (cycle of the sun). This cycle
takes a period of 28 years, after which the days of the week once again
fall upon the same days of the month as they did during the first year
of the former cycle. There is no relationship with the course of the sun
itself, but was invented for the purpose of determining the dominical
letter which designates the days of the month on which the Sundays occur
during each year of the cycle. Since cycles of the sun date from 9 years
before the Christian era, it is necessary to add the digit 9 to the
digits of the current year and then divide the result by 28. The
quotient is the number of cycles which has passed, and the remainder
will be the year of the cycle answering to the current year. The third
opening on the riband is labeled "Num. Aur." (golden number).
[48]
Meton, an
astronomer of Athens, discovered in 432 B.C. that after a period of 19
years the new and the full moons returned on the same days of the month
as they had before, and this is called the cycle of the moon. The Greeks
were so impressed with this calculation that they had it inscribed in
letters of gold upon stone, hence the golden number. The First Council
of Nicaea in A.D. 325 determined that Meton's cycle was to be used to
regulate the movable feasts of the Church.

Immediately above the chapter rings is an opening through which the orb
of the sun is visible.


THE CHAPTER-RING ASSEMBLY

In a separate chapter in his second volume, entitled "Descriptio
Authomatis Summa totius Operis Mechanici" (Description of the
Automaton&mdash;Summary of the Complete Mechanism), Father Borghesi provided
a description of the functions of the various indicators, prefixing it
with the short poem shown in figure 18. He then continues:


In the middle of the frontispiece, as at the center of the
universe, the terraqueous globe of the week revolves, with a
daily motion turning from right to left, bringing with it from
the round window the coming day and at the circumference the
circle of hours common to the sun, to the moon, to the fixed
stars, to the head and tail of the dragon, and to the raging
sea.

The second circle revolves the synodic-periodic measure of the
raging sea, the days of the median lunar-synodic age, the signs
and individual degrees of the signs of the distance of the moon
from the middle of the sun within the time of 29 terrestrial
revolutions, hours 12.44.3.13. This circle revolves likewise
from right to left around the center of the earth. In this
second circle, another little orb revolves, bringing with it
the epicycle of the moon, in which the little circle of the
moon (whose illuminated middle always faces towards the sun),
running from left to right through the signs of the anomaly;
within 13 revolutions of the earth, hours 18.39.16. It descends
from apogee to perigee and in just as many others it returns
from perigee to apogee, to be carried down thus to true, back
and front from the longitude and distance from the sun and from
the middle of the earth.

The third circle (on which I have tried to indicate
astronomically-geometrically in their places, the degrees of
lunar latitude both in the south and in the north, and some
fixed stars, those, namely, which can be separated by us from
the moon which goes between) from left to right turns around
the center of the earth, stretching out the head and tail of
the dragon, on the inside above the second circle for noting
and measuring the sun (but I should rather say the earth), and
the eclipses of the moon, within 346 revolutions of the earth,
hours 14.52.23.

The fourth circle, in which the heaven of the fixed stars,
reduced to the correct ascent of our times, the signs of the
zodiac and the individual degrees of the signs, the months of
the year and the single days of the month can be seen, likewise
makes its journey around the earth from left to right in 365
terrestrial revolutions, hours 5.48.56.; that is, within a
median astronomical year. Above this annual orb, the sun, in
its small epicycle, gliding through the 12 signs of the
anomaly, within the space of 182 terrestrial revolutions, hours
15.6.58., from left to right, falls from apogee to perigee;
and, within the same time, rises from perigee to apogee, and
brings with it, the index, namely its central radius, inhering
to the axis of the equatorial orb and cutting the four greatest
circles from the center.

When the sun has been moved around, Iris shows from six windows
the era, that is, the current year. Two winged youths take
their place next to Iris, carrying the Julian period: namely,
the Roman indiction, the cycle of the sun and the golden
number, on a leaf of paper held between them. The imperial
eagle stands out on top (as if added to the frontispiece)
carrying on its breast the dominating planet and in its talons
the ecclesiastical calends (that is, the dominical letter and
the epact).



ATTACHMENTS FOR ADJUSTMENT

Two attachments, in the form of small superimposed dials are situated at
the base of the dial plate, at either side and immediately below the
fourth chapter ring. In his second volume, Father Borghesi stated that
they "are not moved from inside the clock, but the one at the right
[inscribed concitat and retardat] serves for loosening
[accelerating] and tightening [retarding] time; that is, the reins of
the perpendicular."

In other words, the purpose of this attachment is for adjusting the
pendulum to make the clock operate fast or slow. The second attachment,
which appears at the left, and which is inscribed "Claudit" (close) and
"Aperit" (open) serves the purpose of "&#8230; preparing the mechanism in a
moment, as swiftly as you wish, for sustaining the astronomical
experiments of which you will hear later; when these things have been
done, it restores the mechanism to its natural motion at the same
speed."

This adjustment relates to the final section of Father Borghesi's second
book, entitled "Chronologo-Astronomicus Usus Authomatis"
(Chronological-Astronomical Use of the Automaton), which is translated
from the Latin in its entirety:

[49]


With one glance at this automaton, you can quickly answer these
questions: What hour the sun shows, the moon, any fixed star,
the head and tail of the dragon. Is the sea swelling with
periodic heat [at high tide?] or is it deflated [low tide], or
quiescent? How many days is it from mean new moon or full moon?
By how many signs and degrees is the moon distant from the sun,
and from its nodes? What sign of the zodiac does the sun
occupy, the moon, the head and tail of the dragon? Is the sun
or the moon, in apogee or perigee, ascending or descending?
What is the apparent speed of the sun and of the moon? What is
the apparent magnitude of the solar and lunar diameter, and of
the horizontal parallax of the umbra and penumbra of the earth?
What is the latitude of the moon? Is it north or south? Does
the moon hide [occult eclipse] any of the fixed stars from the
earth dwellers, and which of these does it obscure? Is there a
true new or full moon? Is the sun in eclipse anywhere on earth?
What is the magnitude, and the duration of this eclipse, with
respect to the whole earth? Can it be seen in the north or in
the south? Is the moon in eclipse? Total or partial? Of what
magnitude, etc.? What limb of the moon is obscured? How many
years have passed from a given epoch? Is this year a leap year,
or a common year&mdash;first, second, or third after leap year? What
is the current month of the year, and what day of the month and
of the week? Which of the planets is dominant? What days of the
year do the various feasts fall on, and the movable feasts
during the ecclesiastical year? And many other similar
questions, which I pass over here for the sake of brevity.

Besides, this device can be so arranged for any time
whatsoever, past or future, and for the longitude of any
region, and can be so manipulated by hand, that within the
space of a very short time there can be provided in their
proper order, the various orbits of the luminous bodies, their
alternating eclipses, as many as have taken place through the
course of many years, or even from the beginning of the world;
or those that will be seen as long as the world itself shall
last, with all their attendant circumstances (year, month, day,
duration, magnitude, etc.). All these can be seen with great
satisfaction of curiosity and of learning, and hence with great
pleasure to the soul. In the meanwhile, the little bells
continually play, at their proper, respective times. So that,
all exaggeration aside, a thousand years pass, in the sight of
this clock, as one day!

I am aware of your complaints, O star-loving reader&mdash;that my
description is too meager and too succinct. Lay the blame for
this on those cares, hateful both to me and to you, more
pressing, which forbid me and deprive you of a methodical
explanation of the work.



THE CLOCK MOVEMENT

Father Borghesi specified that the entire mechanism was equal in weight
to a seventh part of a Centenarii Germanici, a Germanic hundredweight.
This is probably the Austrian centner which is equivalent to 123.4615
pounds. Therefore, the clock mechanism weighs approximately 17.6 pounds.

The clock operated for a hundred days and more at a single winding,
according to Father Borghesi, and by means of a pendulum with a leaden
bob weighing 60 Viennese pounds, attached at a height of 5 feet. Father
Borghesi stated the weight of the pendulum to be 60 librarum
Viennensium, but the Viennese libra does not appear among the weights
of the Austrian Empire. However, using the average libra, an ancient
Roman unit of weight equal to 0.7221 pound, it may be assumed that the
driving weight should be approximately 45 pounds.

Father Borghesi, however, does not venture to provide any description
whatsoever of the movement of his second clock in his book. He gave the
following reasons:


But beyond this, I entirely omit [a description of] the further
apparatus of the very many wheels, etc., inside the clock which
carry on its functions, lest I become too verbose for some
persons. To explain more thoroughly the internal labyrinth of
the entire mechanism, from which the movement of the circles or
heavens, etc., are derived, would seem to entangle in too many
complicated perplexities&#8230;. Therefore, that I might not delay
longer, and perhaps to no purpose, I have thought it better to
leave the whole work to the proportionate calculus of the
arithmeticians and the technical skill of mechanics. If they
have any desire to construct a similar mechanism, they will
follow the aforesaid motions of the heavens, etc., not only by
one means alone but by many, more swiftly through thoughtful
study than by any amount of instruction.

For whoever is well versed in the theory of calculus and sets
to work at any given project, will discover any desired motion
by a thousand and more ways, by one or another gearing of
wheels; which an industrious mechanic will carry out in
actuality and without too much difficulty. Nor is there any
reason for anyone to be discouraged, so long as he is not
disgusted by the amount of labor for there is nothing truer
than the old saying "The favorable gods grant everything to the
assiduous laborer."

Nay, further, even this little work itself can be improved on
and surpassed by new inventions. Otherwise that other old
adage, almost as old as the world, would prove false, "What you
have found already done, you can easily repeat, nor is it
difficult to add to what has already been invented." Relying on
this principle, I have already conceived some new things to be
added to the present little work.

right side, with details of chiming mechanism.


[51]

THE BELLS

There is a discrepancy between Father Borghesi's written description in
his second book of the number of bells and those which currently exist
in the clock. At the present time, there are two sets of bells attached
to the upper part of the movement. While Father Borghesi indicated that
there were two sets of bells in the clock, he described the first set by
stating that:


&#8230; there are three bells inside the clock: The largest, when
struck by a little hammer at each mean new moon, signifies the
new moon. The smallest indicates in the same way the full moon
at the time of the mean full moon, by automatic sound. When on
the equatorial earth, the sun appears anywhere in eclipse, two
bells (the largest and the medium) sounding together
automatically, announce that eclipse at the time of the mean
new moon. (I think it is evident that eclipses of the sun occur
at new moons and eclipses of the moon at full moon.)

When the moon is eclipsed, the smallest and the medium bells,
simultaneously and automatically, announce the event to the ear
at the time of the mean full moon. Besides, at the proper time
and automatically, the largest of these bells announces the
current solar hour and the smallest bell strikes the quarter
hours.


In the clock today, the first set consists of a smaller bell fixed
within a larger one. It is presumably these bells that indicate the
eclipses and also strike the hours and quarter hours. A pull cord
attached to the striking mechanism repeats the current hour and quarter
hours at will. The second set consists of nine meshed bells struck with
individual hammers operated by means of a pinned cylinder as in a music
box. On the hour, the chimes play one of two melodies, which may be
changed at will. While not identified, these appear to be Tyrolean folk
melodies. The largest of this set of bells is dissimilar to the other
chimes, and may be the third bell described by Father Borghesi to
signify the new moon.


CHRONOGRAMS

One of the most curious aspects of the second clock produced by Father
Borghesi and Bertolla, as well as of the second published volume, is the
presence of chronograms which occur repeatedly on the clock dial and
throughout the Novissimum Theorico-Practicum Astronomicum Authoma from
the title page to the end of the book. Interestingly enough, Father
Borghesi did not utilize this device even once in his first little book.




Figure 18.&mdash;A chronogram in the text of Father Borghesi&#39;s
second volume, indicating the year 1764. The poem is translated as: "In
the Mount of &#39;AnÃ¡uni,&#39; the inscrutable heavens are led, You learn from
these all the labors of the sun and the moon. Here you are shown and
hear the conjunction of the moon: And a bell brings to the ears by its
sound, all eclipses."


Webster defines a chronogram as an inscription, sentence, or phrase in
which certain letters express a date or epoch. The method used by Father
Borghesi for forming chronograms was a simple one. He used combinations
of uppercase and lowercase letters in two sizes in the inscriptions on
the clock dial and in his writings. At first this curious combination in
the inscriptions on the dial plate was a source of considerable
speculation. The extremely fine quality of the engraving and artistry
was such that these combinations could only be deliberate in nature and
not the accidental whims or accidents of the engraver. Accordingly, they
must be chronographic in intention. Such proved to be the case.

Borghesi used the larger size of uppercase letters to form the
chronogram, and each chronogram was complete within a phrase or line. He
accomplished this by using for this purpose those letters of the
alphabet which form the Roman numerals. The uppercase letters found
within words are copied off in the order in which they appear in the
inscription or phrase. These are then converted into their numerical
equivalents, and totaled. Taking the
[52]
uppermost inscription on the clock
dial as the first example:


FranCIsCVs I sIt pLan.
DoMInator aeternVs


The letters which are intended to form the chronogram are:


C&nbsp; I&nbsp; C&nbsp;
V I I&nbsp; L&nbsp; D&nbsp; &nbsp; M&nbsp; I V

100 1 100 5 1 1 50 500 1000 1 5


These figures added together total 1764.

The second inscription on the clock dial which forms a chronogram is


LaVs saCrosanCtae TrIaDI VnI Deo, et DeIparae

L V&nbsp; C&nbsp; &nbsp;C&nbsp; I&nbsp; D&nbsp; I V I&nbsp; D&nbsp; &nbsp;D&nbsp; I

50 5 100 100 1 500 1 5 1 500 500 1 = 1764.


The third inscription required a little more planning, because of its
greater length. Accordingly, Father Borghesi divided it into nine parts,
each of which is separated from the other by means of asterisks. Each of
the nine parts of the inscription formed a chronogram which, in every
instance, totals to the date 1764, the year in which the second clock
was completed. The same procedure was followed with the inscriptions in
the lower left and the lower right corners of the dial as well as with
the maker's inscription within the central disk. This inscription is


BVrghesIo DoCtore, et BertoLLa LIMatore AnnanIensIbVs

V I&nbsp; D&nbsp; &nbsp;C&nbsp; L&nbsp; L&nbsp; L &nbsp;I&nbsp; &nbsp;M&nbsp;  I I V

5 1 500 100 50 50 50 1 1000 1 1 5 = 1764.


The inscriptions within the chapter ring are not utilized for
chronograms, however. It is apparent that Father Borghesi was required
to make a most careful selection of the texts for his inscriptions in
order that none of the phrases included any additional letters which
formed Roman numerals than would total to the date he desired to
indicate, namely, 1764. Where it was necessary, he employed an asterisk
to separate parts of texts so that each would produce the same total.
Any letter that did not form a Roman numeral, even if capitalized or
used in a larger size, did not interfere with the formation of the
chronograms.

In spite of his ingenuity in designing a text which would include only
such of the letters representing the Roman numerals which would provide
the chronograms for 1764, Father Borghesi experienced some difficulties,
particularly in place names. He accordingly changed them in order to
avoid the inclusion of letters that would have disturbed his totals.
Examples are MEGGL instead of MECHL, which had an extra C, and RVNNO
instead of RVMO, which had an extra M.


PUBLISHED DESCRIPTION OF THE SECOND CLOCK

When the clock had been completed and proved to work successfully,
Borghesi once more reduced a description of the clock and its function
to published form in a second little volume published by Monauni. This
second work was also in Latin, the title of which is translated as The
Most Recent Theoretical-Practical Astronomical Clock According to the
Equally Most Recent System of the World. As with his first book, Father
Borghesi devoted a number of pages to a preface addressed to the reader,
which is translated from the Latin:


This mechanical instrument was far from being ready for public
notice. A great deal of time and work remained to produce a
machine of this new system from the very foundations; then, by
a most accurate calculation to bring the motions of many wheels
up-to-date with the most recent astronomical observations; and,
finally, to fashion it with the craftsman's file, often enough
with a weary hand. All this work I had performed eagerly, so
that, while in my room, I might contemplate leisurely, both day
and night, the true face of the heavens and the seas unobscured
by clouds, even though I had no astronomical equipment. But,
then I remembered that, in my book on the first clock, I had
promised a description of a new (at least, as far as is known
to me) clock. Moreover, friends with astronomical interest, who
took part in the oft-repeated astronomical experiments
concerning this clock, persuaded me that the intellectual world
would enjoy having a greater knowledge and a description of
this work. However, it was not only the promises nor the
desires of many which moved me to write this work, but I also
thought it was necessary to set forth, before the description
of the clock, an exposition of the astronomical system
according to which this clock was constructed, so that the
complete work would be evident to all. I was concerned about
making this timepiece more acceptable and more understandable
to those people who are far distant and unable to see it, so
that this present exposition would obtain credulity among all.
I could find no better method than to set forth for the reader
the theory of the universe which I figured out after many
sleepless nights.

In testing this theory day after day, it not only appeared to
be complete, and true, but each day it appeared more
conformable to reality; it captured my mind in such a way that
I finally adhered to it. I desired, while I lived, to erect
this work as a monument to the theory. To do this, I digressed
a bit from the true-to-life pattern to the mechanical order so
that I could transfer all the movements of the heavens, etc.
(which I enjoyed thinking about more), to the plane surface of
the clock's face. In this way, the ecliptical spectacles of the
stars, etc., would appear at their proper times clearly before
the eyes of the viewer. I could also avoid many difficulties
which otherwise, perhaps, even the hands of the most skillful
craftsmen could never solve.

You ought to know, therefore, that as a result of my nightly
meditations, I have rejected, after much consideration, all the
explanations of the universe thus far published. All other
theories of the make-up of the universe, however admirable, and
however many there are, turn the sun and earth around in an
ecliptic in an annual movement. Thus, Philolaus was the first
to move the earth from the center of the universe and move it
through the void; afterwards, Aristarchus of Samos and then
Copernicus moved the earth with the moon. The Egyptians, as
well as Pythagoras, Ptolemy, Tycho, Riciolus, Longomontanus,
etc., thought that the sun moved through the degrees of the
ecliptic each year. But I attributed this movement to neither
earth nor sun for the movement of both is only apparent. I did
not vainly surmise the annual equilibrium in all astronomical
observations to be from the daily movement of the same axis
moved at the poles of the heavens. Nor, in like manner, is
there a better way to satisfy physical experiments. To you,
then, most cultured reader: If you, perhaps, can make any use
or draw pleasure from this most faithful description of my new
theory and the mechanical instrument, refer it first to God on
High from whom is everything that is best, and then to those
avidly awaiting this little work. Lastly, if you find any
statement less fitting; in your humanity, do not disdain to
excuse it.




Borghesian Theory of the Universe

In Father Borghesi's second volume, there is a separate chapter entitled
"An Exposition of the Latest Theory of the Universe." This follows the
introduction to the reader, and in it Father Borghesi proposed:


That you might rightly conceive my new system of the world and
mechanically, as it were, construct it, imagine for yourself,
beneath that most happy seat of the Blessed and above all other
heavens, a kind of spherical convexity, everywhere equidistant
from the center of the earth, and endowed with absolutely no
motion.

On the inside, at two points diametrically opposite each other,
this convexity has two most sturdy poles (to speak
mechanically), projecting towards the center (which you call
the poles of the heavens), and the largest immobile semicircle,
in some manner is drawn from the center of one pole to the
center of the other. This semicircle in the middle, namely at a
point equidistant from each pole, is thought to be secured by
some sign, for example, by that "o," for arranging more
perceptibly the seat of the sun (as will be shown later). This
much must be conceived first.

[55]

You must understand that imposed on these poles is the first
mobile [Primum Mobile], everywhere convex, and divided, into 12
equal parts [Dodecatemoria], by the 6 greatest circles,
intersecting each other at the centers of the poles. Then it is
divided by another equally great circle, everywhere equidistant
from the poles, into two hemispheres. One hemisphere of 12
parts, proceeding in order from west [setting] to east [rising]
should be assigned the respective signs of the zodiac; that is,
one to Aries, the next to Taurus, and so on, etc. The circle
which cuts those 12 parts transversely in the middle, you call
the ecliptic. Then, these capital spaces of the Primum Mobile
are subdivided by degrees, minutes, etc., both in longitude and
in latitude, so that this heaven represents a kind of great
spherical net, extended to capture the longitude and latitude
of the stars, and Mobile on the aforementioned poles. Note,
however (and this is almost the leading point of the system),
in that circle of longitude which divides the sign of Gemini
from Cancer and Arcitenens [Sagittarius] from Capricorn, you
must conceive two points, directly opposite each other and
removed about twenty-three and a half degrees from the poles:
Boreal [the northern] between Gemini and Cancer; Austral [the
southern] between Sagittarius and Capricorn. These two points
by some power (imagine it is magnetic power), equal between
them, hold the terraqueous orb suspended in the middle, by
acting on the axis of the same orb (imagine it is iron) in such
a way that the earth is continually drawn to those two points
as to two opposite centers. It is never nearer to one, for as
it is about to move towards one, the opposite power is
constantly drawing it back. Thus, both those points and the
axis of the earth are always held in one common line, wherever
those points happen to be carried by the rotation of this
heaven.

Again, it is necessary for you to conceive in this heaven,
first, two great circles, bisecting each other at right angles
in the centers of these two magnets. One of these circles,
passing through the first point of Aries and Libra in the
ecliptic, is called equinoctial colure: the other circle,
passing consequently between the first point of Cancer and
Capricorn, is called solstitial colure. Beneath these are
likewise imagined many other great circles, in the centers of
the magnets dividing crosswise in the shape of an "X." But if,
receding from these magnets, you describe circles (parallel to
each other and ever greater and greater, up to the greatest
circle which you will perceive is called the equator),
equidistant from each magnet and obliquely splitting the
ecliptic in the equinoctial colure, you can then behold a
great, new, woven net in this heaven of the Primum Mobile. This
net most beautifully expands to extract the straight ascent and
descent of the stars, etc., from the vast ocean of the heavens,
catching the straight ascent in the greatest circles and, in
other unequal circles, parallel to each other and obliquely
cutting across, most safely catching the descent.




GLOSSARY

Anomolia or anomaly, is the angular distance of a planet from
its perihelion (that point of the orbit of a planet which is
nearest to the sun) as seen from the sun.

Aequinoctium or the equinox, is the time in which days and
nights are equal in the space of hours. There are two
equinoxes: the spring equinox&mdash;c. 8 calends of April in the
sign of Aries; and the fall equinox&mdash;c. 10 calends of October
in the sign of Libra.

Aeras is derived from aera, aerae, which originally meant a
given number, usually used in regard to money. The word was
later extended to mean a number used in any calculation, and
finally it came to mean a certain time from which subsequent
times were counted, e.g., Anno Domini, after the Birth of
Christ.

Coluri or the Colures, which are two circles in the heavenly
sphere, passing through the poles of the world and cutting each
other at right angles: the one passes through the equinoctial
points of Aries and Libra and is called Colurus
Aequinoctiorum or equinoctial colure; the other touches the
solstitialia of Cancer and Capricorn and is called Colurus
Solstitiorum or solstitial colure. They are called Colurus,
which is translated as "mutilated tails," for the part which
emerges in the Antarctic is not visible and is quasitruncated.

Ecliptica or the ecliptic, is an imaginary line in the heavens
in which the sun was supposed to have performed its annual
course.

Epicyclus or epicycle, is a small orb which, being fixed in the
deferent of a planet, is carried along with its motion and yet,
with its own peculiar motion, carries the body of the planet
fastened to it round about its proper center.

Iris or the rainbow. In mythology, Iris was the daughter of
Thaumatis and Electra, messenger of Juno of the goddesses and
Jove of the gods.

Solstitium or the solstice, is that time when the sun seems to
stand still for a short time: when the sign of Cancer enters
the month of June (equivalent to the summer solstice, when the
sun begins to recede from us); and when the sign of Capricorn
enters the month of December (equivalent to the winter
solstice, when the sun begins to accede to us).


[56]


Immediately below the Primum Mobile place the heaven of the
fixed stars (and, that the idea might be clearer), revolving
separately on the same poles on which the Primum Mobile
revolves. Through this heaven, the filaments of the little
nets, etc., seem to the eyes of you on earth as if they shine.
In this heaven, you should conceive in their fixed places, the
fixed stars, a proportionate, inviolable distance from each
other, and, indeed, if you will, the heavenly images, etc.,
depicted, and all carried along at the same time with their
heaven by one motion.

Conceive a straight line running from the center of the earth
to that sign "o" noted in the semicircle of the supreme
immobile heaven. On this line, greatly below the heaven of the
fixed stars, place the center of the solar epicycle, holding an
area in common with the ecliptic and subject to absolutely no
motions, but at such a distance from the center of the earth
that the semidiameter of the earth has little, if any,
proportion with the distance of the solar epicycle from the
earth. Around the sun, moving continually in this epicycle (its
immobile palace) through the degrees of the anomaly, you can
revolve, with motions proportionate to the system, the five
planets: Mercury and Venus (the nearest barons of the sun),
then Mars, Jupiter and, most remote, Saturn, with its
respective satellites, etc., eccentrically surrounding the
earth itself and the moon in their immense ambit and wandering
by their proper motions through the zodiac.

Nevertheless, not far from the earth you should imagine
fabricated, as from most refined crystal, the heaven of the
moon everywhere equidistant from the center of the earth and
revolving separately on the same poles (prolonged even to this
place) on which the Primum Mobile and the heaven of the fixed
stars revolve. In the middle of this, that is, in some point
equally removed from the poles, you place the center of the
lunar epicycle, movable also by the common rotation of the
lunar heaven. I refrain from the other movements of the moon in
latitude, etc., as also those of the five planets, etc., which
the theory in no way excludes, lest by a variety of congested
motions explained too abundantly, either you might be confused
about the fundamental concept of the system or, while adorning
the theory and trying to embellish the least things more
widely, you might reject also the things which are capital.

Here you already have the whole machine, but still inert and to
be animated for the first time by motions accommodated to the
system. Nevertheless, before I assign motion to the individual
parts of the world, so that the thing might later appear more
clearly to you, I arrange all things thus: first, as if by
hand, I turn the Primum Mobile until the Boreal magnetic point
comes to the level or the area of the semicircle described in
the supreme immobile convexity; then I turn the heaven of the
fixed stars until, for example, the heel of Castor (a star of
the third magnitude), almost in the ecliptic and indeed in our
time not far distant from the solstitial colure, likewise falls
nearly at the level of the aforesaid semicircle. Later, I turn
the lunar heaven until I bring the center of the lunar epicycle
to the same level. Then, I turn the earth until some
predetermined city, for example, Trent, situated in the
northern zone with a latitude of about forty-six degrees, is
brought to the oft-mentioned level.

From things arranged in this way and from what has gone before,
it is evident (with the motions of the luminaries in epicycles
left out, however, lest you be distracted by the explanation)
that at Trent, just as in the whole northern hemisphere, it is
the summer solstice; and, conversely, in the southern
hemisphere, it is the winter solstice. The reason is because
the northern magnetic point together with the northern half of
the earthly axis is at its highest point towards the sun,
immovably residing in a line sent through the level of the
highest semicircle; and, conversely, the southern magnetic
point with the corresponding half of the axis is most removed
from the same. It further follows, that noonday and the new
moon coincide, and the heel of Castor almost reaches the
summit, etc.

Now, beginning from this hypothetical situation of the whole
world as from the root of the motions, I move all things in
their circles so that the earth turns on its axis with a
revolving motion from west to east in each 24 hours of median
time. The lunar heaven completes one circle around its poles
likewise from west to east in the time of 29 terrestrial
revolutions, hours 12.44.3.13.1. The sphere of the fixed stars
on the same poles revolves once from east to west within 365
revolutions of the earth, hours 6.9.29.1. The Primum Mobile on
the poles (common to the heaven of the fixed stars and the
heaven of the moon), is moved once in the same way from east to
west, a little faster, however, than the heaven of the fixed
stars, yet within 365 revolutions of the earth, hours 5.48.56;
that is, within a median astronomical year.

Now, behold for yourself a new world supported on new poles and
provided with new motions and laws. Now you, reader and lover
of the stars, turn it, and revolve it as long as it pleases
you, and compare it astronomically and physically with the
Copernican or the Tychonian systems or with whatever one
pleases you more, and judge which one seems more consonant with
nature when all things are examined. But if you aren't able to
reconcile this theory with some astronomical observations or
physical experiments and think it should be
[57]
eliminated from
the group of theories, see that I might know this while life is
still my companion, so that I might think with you, if this is
possible. Also, so that, in gratitude for the detected or
perhaps hidden error, I might speak or write, and you won't
have to shout in vain in bold ridicule and with no applause
after the fleeing shades of the dead and the mute ashes. But,
if you object that the daily motion of the revolving earth and
the annual motion of its whirling axis do not sufficiently
agree with certain texts of Sacred Scripture, and if those
things which the Copernicans and the Longomontanists say do not
convince you, then reject my whole system as an old wives'
tale.





Last Years


There is a break in the story of Borghesi and Bertolla for the next five
years. The second clock may have been the last project on which the
priest and the clockmaker worked together, for very good reasons. The
two clocks must have represented a considerable financial investment in
materials and in time, and neither of the men was in sufficiently
affluent circumstances to undertake the luxury of such a hobby without
some form of recompense. The publication of the two little volumes must
have also been done at Father Borghesi's expense. The income of the
parish priest in a small mountain village could not have been equal to
the relatively great costs of the projects that had been completed. It
seems probable that the priest attempted to sell his clocks to a wealthy
patron, perhaps the Baron of Cles, or he may have attempted to obtain
some form of recompense for the continuation of his research. However,
no records can be found of such patronage if it existed. If Borghesi had
received financial assistance while the projects were in progress, he
would certainly have made adequate mention of the patron's name and
assistance in one or the other of the two volumes which he
published.
[17]

The next record relating to Borghesi which has been found is the
description of a letter written by an anonymous mathematician late in
1768 or early in 1769. It was 28 pages in length, written in Latin, in
the form of a reply to the writer's brother, on the subject of the clock
invented by Borghesi. It consisted primarily of a criticism launched
against Borghesi's first little volume published in 1763.

The anonymous letter is without date, place, or signature. This writer
claimed that Father Borghesi had made many errors in his book,
presumably in the description of the clock's functions, and in the basic
theories upon which the priest had predicated his research. No complete
copy of the letter's text has been found for study, although it is
described at length in Tovazzi's Biblioteca Tirolese. Tovazzi noted
that four copies of the letter existed at that time, and that he
personally had filed one in the Biblioteca di Cles in Trent. However,
every attempt to locate a copy at the present time has been
unsuccessful.

If the anonymous letter was brought to the attention of Father Borghesi,
it must have introduced a disturbing note into his life and cost the
priest many unhappy moments. He was not, however, dissuaded from his
preoccupation with horology. Several years later, in 1773, Father
Borghesi was working on yet another astronomical clock, this time
presumably without the assistance of Bertolla. This third clock was
reported by Tovazzi to have been "of minimum expense but of maximum
ingenuity."

No subsequent information relating to it has come to light, and there is
no record that it was actually completed.

Again there is a period of silence in the life of Father Borghesi which
no amount of research has yet been able to pierce. Whatever the
circumstances may have been, it is reported by several of the sources
noted that both the first and the second clock did, in fact, become the
property of the Empress Maria Theresa in Vienna. The presentation was
made sometime during the period between the completion of the second
clock in 1764 and the year 1780. There is some discrepancy in the
contemporary accounts as to whether Father Borghesi presented one or two
clocks to the Empress, but all the sources with but one exception record
that both clocks were acquired by the Empress.

It is doubtful that Father Borghesi had originally intended to give his
clocks to the Empress at the time that they were made, for he would most
certainly have made some mention of such an intention in the two little
volumes which he published about them. If he saw the letter published by
the anonymous mathematician in late 1768 or 1769, it is possible that he
decided to make the presentation in expiation of his sense of guilt for
the amount of his time which the creation of the timepieces had
consumed. On the other hand, it is just as possible that Father Borghesi
may have forwarded copies of his two little volumes to the Imperial
Court at Vienna, and that the
[58]
Empress expressed a desire to acquire the clocks.

Father Tovazzi states that in 1780 "the clock invented by him [Borghesi]
was preserved in Vienna, Austria, at the Imperial Court from which the
inventor was receiving an annual pension of 400 florins." No records in
the Palace archives relating to the clock have yet been found, nor
records of payment of an annuity to Father Borghesi. However, a more
exhaustive investigation of the Furniture Depository of the Imperial
Court may bring forth related records. It was the implication in Father
Tovazzi's account that the second clock had been presented to the
Empress prior to the publication of the anonymous, critical letter in
1768 or 1769. He believed that it was envy of Father Borghesi's
ingenuity, fame and financial benefit that had caused the anonymous
mathematician to publish his letter, for Tovazzi asked "Who would have
encountered opposition to such a marvel? Envy is not yet dead, and has
always reigned."

This last-mentioned theory about the presentation may be the most likely
one. Some evidence may be found in the second clock itself which bears
out this assumption. The multiple chapter ring, with its many
inscriptions, is engraved and silvered in a relatively crude manner,
presumably by Bertolla himself. The main dial plate, however, which is
of gilt brass, is engraved with the utmost skill by one of the great
masters of the art. The inscription below the Imperial Hapsburg eagle
relates to Francis I, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. It is entirely
possible that although Father Borghesi originally had no intention of
giving the clock to the Emperor or the Empress at the time that it was
made, he later changed his mind. Accordingly, he may have commissioned a
master engraver, possibly in Trent or in Vienna itself, to produce a
dial plate which would be of such a quality as to be worthy of the
Emperor himself. If so, this was done shortly after the clock was
completed, for the Emperor died in August of the following year. Perhaps
by the time that the clock was ready, the Emperor had already died, and
Father Borghesi gave the clock instead to Maria Theresa without revising
the inscription.

The acceptance of the clocks by the Empress, and the annuity which was
his reward, would have constituted considerable honor even for one of
the foremost clockmakers of the Empire, but for a humble parish priest
in a little village, such notable Imperial recognition was overwhelming.
Possibly as a result of it, a change was noted in Father Borghesi in the
next few years. His conscience began to bother him, and he began to
question whether he had done right in spending so much of his time and
thought on his horological research. He became more and more confused in
his own mind. Had he spent too much time in mechanical studies to the
neglect of his ecclesiastical duties? If this had been the case, he had
committed the most grievous sin.

Exaggerated though these thoughts may appear, they were undoubtedly of
the most critical importance to the middle-aged priest. His mental
turbulence and confusion increased daily, and it soon became apparent to
others around him. By June 1779, he was completely in the grip of his
obsession, and his parishioners began to whisper amongst themselves that
their pastor was being tortured by the devil. They were unable to help
him, and he became more and more preoccupied with his problem. The years
passed slowly as the pastor became more vague and more tortured by his
conscience.
[18]

There probably was continued contact between Father Borghesi and
Bertolla for at least some time after the development of his illness.
Bertolla had retired from active work, but continued to pursue his
interests in his clockshop as much as his health and advanced years
permitted. A clock which he made at the age of 80 survives and is
described and illustrated in the following section on "The Clocks of
Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla." Finally, on January 15, 1789, Bertolla
passed away and Father Borghesi was left alone, deprived of the
companionship he had enjoyed with the older man for the past two or
three decades. One of Bertolla's nephews continued to work in the master
clockmaker's workshop, but there did not appear to be any association
between the younger man and Father Borghesi.

At last, in 1794, Father Borghesi lost his sanity completely, and he was
forced to relinquish his pastoral duties to a curate. For the remaining
eight years of his life, he continued to live in the rectory of the
little parish church in Mechel where most of his life had been spent,
his needs undoubtedly attended by the parishioners he could no longer
serve. During this period, until his death at the age of 79 on June 12,
1802, Father Borghesi lived on, oblivious of those around him.
Seemingly, he retired to another world; perhaps to that universe which
he had tried to reproduce in his second clock.

The Clocks of Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla




Figure 21.&mdash;Tall-case clock by Bertolla in the Episcopal
Palace in Trent, made for Bishop Cristoforo Sizzo di Noris. A striking
and repeating clock with lunar phases. (Courtesy of Museo Nazionale
della Scienza e della Tecnica, Milan.)


The ingenuity displayed in the Borghesi clock by its constructor,
Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla, requires a consideration of the other
examples of his work that have survived. The most important of his
clocks are probably the one in the Episcopal Palace at Trent and another
made for the Baron of Cles.

The one which survives in the Episcopal Palace to the present time, is
extremely tall and is housed in an elaborately decorated narrow case of
black or ebonized wood approximately 9 to 10 feet in height. The upper
part of the case is decorated with elaborately carved and gilt rococo
motifs. The movement operates for one year at a winding, indicates and
strikes the hours, and shows the lunar phases. It has an alarm, and will
repeat the strike at will, indicating the number of the past hour and
the quarters. The gilt brass dial is decorated with silver-foliated
scrollwork in relief at the corners, inside the chapter ring, and within
the broken arch. Featured above the chapter ring is the coat of arms,
executed in silver, of the patron for whom the clock was made,
Cristoforo Sizzo di Noris. Di Noris was Bishop of Trent for 13 years,
from 1763 to 1776.

The clock which Bertolla made for the Baron of Cles is a tall, narrow,
case clock of ebony or ebonized pearwood which is approximately 91/2
feet in height. The decoration of the case is considerably more
conservative than the one made for Di Noris, but the black wood is
decorated with silver trim and carved designs in the wood itself. The
dial is decorated with silver scrollwork and spandrels within and around
a raised chapter ring. The clock operates for one month at each winding,
has an alarm, indicates and strikes the hours, and will repeat the
quarters. This handsome timepiece is still in the possession of the
descendants of the Baron of Cles.

According to Pippa,
[19] certain characteristics become apparent in a
study of the surviving clocks by Bertolla. The tall-case clocks are
narrow and range in height from 73/4 feet to 101/2 feet. The cases had
this excessive height in order to obtain the greatest fall for the month
and year movements which Bertolla constructed. For the weight assembly,
he substituted a drum wound with a key at the point of the driving wheel
in place of the customary pulley. The addition of an intermediate wheel
augmented the drop of the weight.

Bertolla's movements were solidly constructed from well-hammered brass
and iron. He favored the recoil anchor escapement in his clocks and the
Graham dead-beat anchor escapement with a seconds' pendulum. The
escapement was not always placed in the traditional location in the
upper center between the plates. Bertolla occasionally displaced the
pendulum to one side, to the lower part of the movement or placed it
entirely between two other small plates.
[20]

He utilized every type of striking work, including the music-box
cylinder common in the clocks of the Black Forest and the rack and
snail. Bertolla most frequently employed the hour strike and grand
sonnerie. He often used a single hammer on two bells of different sound
with the rack and snail. An example of this type is the clock he
produced at the age of 80. To achieve the necessary axis of rotation for
the hammer, which is perpendicular to the plate when it strikes the
hours, it moves to an oblique position and displaces one of the two long
pins in an elongated opening.

Bertolla's dial plates were generally well executed,
[63]
with a raised or
separate chapter ring applied to a brass or copper plate, such as a
copper-plate repoussÃ© and gilt with baroque motifs, or upon a smooth
brass plate with spandrels of repoussÃ© work usually of silver, in
relief and attached. The engraving of the chapter rings was excellent.
The hands were well executed in steel or perforated bronze, and
occasionally of repoussÃ© copper; gilt was applied to the hands made of
forged steel.

In the course of time, Bertolla's home workshop passed from one
generation to another within the family. Inevitably, it underwent many
modifications until the only original part of the building that remained
intact from Bertolla's time was his clockshop.

Within the last few years, the workshop room was acquired complete with
contents from Bertolla's descendants, and installed in the Museo
Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnica in Milan as an exhibit of a
typical 18th-century clockmaker's shop. The original workshop was
dismantled in Mocenigo di Rumo and completely rebuilt in the museum,
including the walls, ceiling and floor. The paneling and woodwork of the
walls and ceiling, which have been preserved intact, are hand-cut fir,
with columns, trim and moldings carved by hand. A small painting is
featured in the center of the coffered ceiling. The original shop
benches and chests of drawers are set around the reconstructed shop and
Bertolla's tools and equipment laid out as they had been originally.
Other clockmaker's tools and equipment in the museum's collection are
also displayed. Approximately 40 percent of the tools are the original items
[64]
from Bertolla's shop. Parts of clocks and works in progress are
on view on the benches as they were in Bertolla's time.
[21] Also
preserved in the museum are sketches found in Bertolla's manuscripts,
some of which are reproduced on the following pages.

Luigi Pippa of Milan.)


The shop contains two completed clocks made by Bertolla. One is a
weight-driven lantern clock typical of the 18th century, Italian style
with brass dial, plates and posts, anchor escapement, and striking
work. The dial is engraved in the usual style of Bertolla's baroque
design, and the hands are of pierced bronze. Another clock associated
with Bertolla and found in the shop, was made by his nephew, Alessandro
Bertolla, who worked in Venice after his apprenticeship with his uncle
had been completed. This clock is a regulator with a seconds' pendulum
and sweep hand on an enameled dial. The original case has not survived.

One of the most interesting of Bertolla's clocks, and probably the last
one which he produced, was found in his workshop. This timepiece
indicates the hours, minutes and quarters by means of a single hand or
index. The weight-driven clock strikes the hours and quarters on two
bells with a single hammer. The chapter ring, which is soldered to the
dial plate, is marked for the minutes on the outer rim and for the four
quarters inside it. Over the center of it, is a semicircular opening in
the dial plate through which is visible a revolving disk attached behind
the dial plate. This disk is marked with the hours and revolves from
right to left, the current hour being indicated by a projection from the
minute ring. The brass dial plate is engraved with simple floral
designs in the corners and around the broken arch. There is no
comparison between this crude and simple decoration and the extremely
fine quality of the engraving on the dial plate of the Borghesi clock,
for instance. In the center of the dial plate is engraved the following:


"Questo orologio l'ideai e lo feci nella mia avanzata etÃ 
d'anni 80. Barto Anto Bertolla"

(I designed and made this clock at my advanced age of 80 years.
Bartolomeo Antonio Bertolla.)

The abbreviation in the inscription "pLan" is difficult to
interpret. According to Father F. X. Winters, S.J., it may represent
"sit planetis" or "sit planetarum." The use of an abbreviation was
necessary to prevent the addition of another letter I or M, which would
have disturbed the formation of the chronogram desired. Literally, "sit
planetis" means "May he be eternal ruler by [or through] favor of
the planets," while "sit planetarum" is to be translated "May he be
eternal ruler of the planets." Father Winters considered both versions
somewhat overexaggerated and proposed that the best translation might be
"Long Live Francis I, Emperor."


[15]
The word "Tempe" refers to the Vale of Tempe, in Thessaly,
through which the Peneus River flows. It is between Mounts Olympus and
Ossa, and is situated between the town of Larissa and the sea. In
mythology, it is told that these mounts were originally joined and
Hercules separated them to allow the river to pass between them. The
word "Tempe" is also used to mean any pleasant place. Thus, the
inscription "Tempe indesinenter clausa, Scaturigo signata" is literally
translated "Tempe always closed, A fount of water sealed up" or, freely
translated, as "A garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up."

Appendix

SYNOPSIS OF THE COMPLETE MECHANICAL WORKS OF THE FIRST CLOCK

[Translated from the section entitled "Synopsis Totius Operis
Mechanici" in Francesco Borghesi's first book Novissima Ac
Perpetua Astronomica Ephemeris Authomatica
Theorico-Practica&#8230;.]


I

Of three movable indices, the farthest from the center of the dial is
fitted with an index on either side and marked with four segments of a
circle. Immediately below are five numbers, divided into the days of
setting the measure of the mean-synodic age of the moon, and into signs,
degrees of the signs, and of the distance of the moon from the sun.
These, in each revolution, revolve once around the solar disk
superimposed on the mean synodic-lunar disk, and also around the lunar
disk. The upper indices, meanwhile, in the two external greatest orbits,
measure the time continuously, in the accustomed manner of the
Germans&mdash;the middle index measuring by hours and the uppermost by the
first minutes [of hours].


II

Inside these three circles, perpendicular above their center, is a small
index of the seconds of minutes. At each first minute of time, being the
fastest of all, it describes the smallest orbit. Next to this are two
other slightly larger circles divided into 30 degrees, one [rotating?]
from the right, the other from the left. These two indices are arranged
in such a fashion that the one rotating from the observer's left
completes its period 12 times during one, mean, solar-astronomical year.
The one [rotating] from the right likewise completes its cycle 12 times
during the period of one mean-synodic moon. In between these, there is
placed another small sphere, divided into 40 arbitrary parts, whose dial
does not move automatically, but is moved by hand for speeding up or
slowing down the course of the time, or of the perpendicular.


III

Diagonally from the sides of the center of the three larger indices, six
other indices revolve: three on the left from one center, and three on
the right from another. The uppermost of the three which are on the
right of the observer [and which are] decorated with a small disk of the
sun, runs its cycle once during a mean solar-astronomical year. The
second measures the distance of the sun from its apogee. The third
revolves 12 times, with each lunar revolution from one node to the same
[repeated] node. Under the point of the uppermost index, first lie the
months of the year which are inscribed, and the days of each month, but
having only 28 days assigned to February; then the signs of the zodiac,
and their several degrees. The circle corresponding to the middle index,
extending through the first semicircle from apogee to the lower perigee
and returning through the second semicircle to the upper locations of
apogee, shows the true equation or eccentricity of the sun, joined with
the little equation of the moon in syzygy. [These equations are]
measured by geometric-astronomic proportion
[72]
for each distance of the
sun from its apogee or perigee in degrees, and in sufficiently small
parts of degrees, with the title added above in their proper places,
whether an addition is to be made to the mean location of the sun or a
subtraction from the same, so that the true longitude of the sun may be
calculated. Three circles are assigned to the lowest index, of which 30
degrees of distance of the moon from its nodes comprise the larger. The
middle circle is based on the hypothesis of the mean invariable
diameters (that is, of the sun, the moon, and the terrestrial shadow),
and is divided into hours and quarters of duration. The last circle is
divided by the trigonometric laws into the inches of magnitude of lunar
eclipses. Lying between these circles, there is another eccentric circle
(black with a spot) exhibiting the shadow of the earth, in which the
little moon sinks itself, carried by the lowest index. In any ecliptic
full moons, the patent number of inches of immersion somehow affects the
minds of the cultured, but also the scheme of maximum obscuration
affects the eyes of the illiterate themselves.


IV

Of the three indices which revolve from the left, the uppermost
completes its cycle within 12 hours, just as the hour index. The middle
one with two pointers on diametrically opposite sides, carries the marks
of conjunction and opposition of the luminous bodies, with a movement
equal to the course of the sun from lunar apogee or perigee. The lowest
index, fitted with a single pointer, indicates the motion of the moon
from its apogee or perigee. Under these three indices, there is situated
a common circle, divided into 12 parts, each of which are further
divided into 30 parts through its outer circumference. I have said a
common circle, for, with respect to the first index, the division
represents 12 hours, and the double subdivision representing the double
set of minutes of the hours serves for an excitator for anytime at all,
at will. For as often as the little index reaches the twelfth hour,
first being moved by hand wherever you prefer, a little hammer strikes
the little bell many times. But if you observe the second or the third
index, the first division provides the signs, and the subdivision of the
signs gives the individual degrees of the distance of the sun from the
lunar apogee, or of the moon from its apogee, respectively. To this is
added two other interior circles from the same center: to the larger is
inserted the equation of the center of the moon in its conjunctions and
oppositions; and on the smaller the equation of the same moon in its
quarters, astronomically-geometrically proportioned to the distance of
the moon from its apogee or perigee. In the first case, the equation is
to be subtracted from the mean longitude of the moon, descending from
apogee to perigee; in the second case, to be added to the mean longitude
of the moon ascending from perigee to apogee; and, in the third
semicircle of the index, as the rubric directs, common to both
equations, added around the center.


V

Perpendicularly under the center of the machine, two other indices are
carried about one and the same center. The one nearer to the
observer&mdash;bearing in one of two points diametrically opposite the small
disk of the sun, in the other the disk of the moon&mdash;runs a course equal
to the motion of the sun from the head or the tail of the dragon
(Draco). The other, of simple construction, marked with a small moon,
signifies in like manner the motion of the moon from the head or the
tail of the dragon.

Immediately below, there is a larger circle, common [referring] to both
these indices, which is divided into 12 parts. Each of these parts in
turn, in the outer periphery, is subdivided further into 30 parts, which
are the 12 signs of the zodiac and the individual degrees of the signs
of distance of the sun and the moon from the head of the dragon.

In the second circle is read the latitude of the moon, measured by
degrees, etc., on a trigonometric scale, by signs and degrees of
distance of the moon from its nodes, that is, from the head or tail of
the dragon. When the second index is descending from the head of the
dragon to the tail, the latitude will be to the north of the solar path;
that is, the ecliptic. On the other hand, it will be south of the
ecliptic when the same index is returning upward from the tail to the
head of the dragon as advised by the title inscribed on the third
circle.

Finally, on the fourth and last circle are seen more prime minutes of
the circle for reducing the orbit of the moon to the ecliptic. That the
true longitude of the moon may be obtained more accurately, these must
be subtracted from the longitude of the moon
[73]
already calculated in the
first and third quadrant of the circle of the second index. On the other
hand, they are to be added to the same in the second and fourth
quadrant, as is noted in their respective places, according to the
theory of right ascensions.

Here, then, [you have] as finally completed, delineation of the great
index which was partially described before in this book.

From two points of that index which perpendicularly correspond to the
center of these circles, a pair of compasses, by an unvaried aperture up
to the circumference of the first larger circle, has marked off four
segments of a circle. The two larger segments, equal among themselves,
in one aperture refer to the sun, and the two smaller in the other,
likewise equal, refer to the moon. The one pointer is for determining
the solar eclipses; the other, for lunar. Both segments of each
division, like little wings of the index, stretch to the extent of the
degree of distance of the moon from its nodes, and to which that
determined latitude corresponds. On one side, that latitude precisely
equals the radii of the earth, the sun, and the moon, as the termini of
solar eclipses; and, on the other side, precisely equals the radii of
the earth's shadow and of the moon, as the confines of lunar eclipses.
The apexes of the last index, diametrically limited [opposite], indicate
the age of the moon, and its mean distance from the sun; one pointer,
upon which the sun sits, measuring the mean days and degrees from the
full moon; the other, on which the moon sits, measuring the mean days
and degrees from the new moon.


VI

Besides the larger and smaller indices already mentioned, all [of which]
revolve within the periphery of the three largest circles, six dials in
this clock also revolve within the same circles which are to be seen
through six openings of the frontispiece. The first of these, intended
to indicate the phases of the moon by an unusual method (completely
black, and decorated with the characters of the principal aspects of the
moon) continually revolves interiorly around the center of the machine
and at the new moon, it completely removes from sight the face of the
moon through the round window. It continually recedes through the first
half of the circle until, at the time of the full moon, it restores the
moon, looking out with a full star. Soon again, too slow to be
observed, it returns through the other half of the circle, so that in
the next conjunction, the whole face of the moon may have a covering of
darkness, once again to be removed.

The other dials are moved by spontaneous advances at stated times. The
first of these shows, through a square opening, the day of the month;
the second, through another opening, shows the current day of the week
with the characters of the seven planets which, according to ancient
superstition, preside over each day of the week (now, by a truer form of
religion divided by the Church into ferias, etc.); that is, the sun, the
moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, to which I have added
the numbers of the ferias. These two little dials are advanced daily, by
a sudden movement at midnight. The remaining three are changed
automatically only once a year on the first of January.

The first of these dials contains five little cells, opening from a
common window: in the first cell, at the edge of the dial, is found the
dominical letter; in the second, the cycle of the sun; in the third, the
character; in the fourth, the sign; and, in the fifth, the house of the
planet dominating the year. The second dial shows the epacts, with the
golden number. The third, and last of all, shows the Roman cycle.

Finally, as indicated by the epact and the dominical letter in an
immovable table added outside, are the feastdays and other movable
events of the year; that is, Easter, the four seasons, the Rogation
Days, etc.


VII

But lest the various movements of the indices and the various beginnings
of the divisions tend to cause some fatigue, the precaution has been
taken, that all the indices by common law are moved from the top towards
the right of the observer, and from thence all the arithmetic divisions
of the circles take their beginning. And lest the multitude of different
figures should deceive the eye, the larger divisions of the circles have
been marked by Roman numbers, that is, by capital letters of the
alphabet; others, in other places, by differently colored numbers. Thus,
the movements of the indices, the distribution of the circles and the
multitude of numbers not only do not disturb the eyes and the mind, but
rather marvelously delight them.

[74]


VIII

After having completed briefly the description of the dial and the
indices and their motions, I have not without reason delayed in
satisfying the desires of many who wish to learn at least the method by
which, from this mechanism, may be calculated the true times of new and
full moons, and their ecliptics. In order to make these matters clearer,
it is necessary that they be explained here at greater length.

With the indices, then, adjusted astronomically-geographically to the
longitude of any given region, and to the mean time whether past,
present or future, and assuming the clock to be in normal operation (as
at present it has been for a whole year and more), then the moon will be
in conjunction with the sun in the heavens. When the equations on the
mechanism are examined, the sun and moon shall be found to be in the
same degree of longitude, and in the same part of a degree. There will
also be an ecliptic new moon that is in conjunction with a solar
eclipse, or rather with a terrestrial eclipse. This will occur if, at
that time, both apexes of the first index, located below the center of
the clock, are hidden by the two segments of the circle extending from
the center of the mechanism through the lowest index.

And the eclipse will be greater and greater and, consequently, visible
in more regions of the earth, the more deeply the two pointers,
indicating the distance of the sun from its apogee, are hidden in the
center of the segments.

But whether the eclipse takes place in the head or in the tail of the
dragon, or whether it is north or south, is indicated by the small disk
of the sun attached to one of the two pointers hidden by the segments of
the circle. If, at that time, the little disk shall be found in the head
of the dragon inscribed on the plane of the dial, then the sun has been
snatched from the earth and ingloriously entombed, as it were, in the
huge jaw of the dragon. Then, &#8230; the heavens themselves will lend aid
to the woeful pomp of the senseless funeral in full darkness by suddenly
lighting the unhappy lamps of the fixed stars. However, if the little
disk occupies the tail of the dragon on the mechanism, then the sun in
the heavens also, as if freed from the toils of the immense dragon's
tail, will emerge without difficulty.

The center of the eclipse will traverse the hemisphere of the earth
north of the solar path, always nearer to the pole of the ecliptic, in
proportion to the inclination of the disk to the north. On the other
hand, if the little disk inclines to the left semicircle, then the
people south of the solar path will enjoy the spectacle of the total
central eclipse.

But if the little disk remains neutral (inclining neither way) and
remains halfway between the two sections of the circle, then the
greatest solar eclipse will take place at the equator and those who live
near the poles of the ecliptic will not enjoy a trace of that eclipse.
This is because the half of the equatorial diameter enormously
outmeasures even the greatest apparent semidiameters of the sun and of
the moon, even taking as a norm the smallest horizontal parallax of the
moon.

What has been said about the true new moon is to be understood also,
proportionately, about the true full moon. For when, with respect to the
equations of the centers, the moon shall be distant on the mechanism by
a full semicircle from the sun (also in the heavens it will be truly in
opposition to the sun) there will be a true full moon. Likewise, the
moon in the heavens will be in eclipse if, at the time of opposition,
the pointers of the little index (which we mentioned before) situated
below the center of the clock are so far away from the belly of the
dragon that they are forced to lie under the two smaller segments of the
circle which, in all full moons, are always to be moved from the index
of the synodic moon to the region of that little index. As a matter of
fact, the closer the little pointers approach to the middle of the
segments, the more obscured it will be.

You will know, furthermore, that the eclipse of the moon occurs in the
head of the dragon if the disk of the little moon, attached to the other
point of the little index, is raised to the head of the dragon;
conversely, when the little disk of the moon inclines to the tail, the
eclipse is taking place in the tail of the dragon.

And, accordingly, when you observe the little moon of the index inclined
to one or other section of the circle, so also in the heavens, the
eclipse of the moon is only partial and the northern or the southern
part of the moon is illuminated.

The current time will indicate whether the lunar eclipse is visible or
not. As the new moon ecliptic falls during the day, the eclipse will not
be visible, since the earth denies a sight of the moon which is below
the horizon. But, conversely, if there are no clouds, the eclipse will
be visible anywhere, if the
[75]
luminous bodies are ecliptically in opposition at night.

Since lunar eclipses appear to all people as being of the same magnitude
and duration, and begin and dissipate at the same absolute moment of
time, I decided to reveal another facet of this spectacle on the right
side of the center of the clock (see chapter III above). There, at the
time of the true ecliptic full moon, as the pointer of the third little
index shows, you can ascertain the hours, etc., of duration, and the
inches of greatest obscuration. The little moon attached to the index is
a model of the actual eclipsed moon.


IX

Thus, with the aid of this machine, solar and lunar eclipses of the past
can be recalled and future ones can be foreseen. Indeed, if the index of
prime minutes is speeded up by hand, whose wheel imparts motion to the
other indices and shields, then, the dials and openings will foretell
the year, month, day, hour, etc., of any future eclipse. I foresaw that
the times would thus be evolved too slowly, and that the clock wheels
would be considerably worn by repeated experiments (if, for instance, by
the rotation of the index of prime minutes, to whose period only a
single hour corresponds, the future new and full moon ecliptics were
being investigated). Therefore, I took care that the wheel which
immediately communicates motion to the index of the synodic moon should
be so fitted internally to the mechanism that by the reversal of any
external index, the wheel would be removed from its proper position;
whenever desired, it could be quickly and most accurately restored to
its proper place.

In this way, since the close meshing of the wheels is released, you can
extend the experiment for many years, even for many centuries. You have
only to guide with your hand the index of the synodic moon on the
circles, always intently observing whether, in the passage which this
index makes over the little index, both pointers of the little index are
hidden by the segments of the circle. Having observed this, look at the
index moved by hand, for if this has carried the solar disk halfway
between the two larger segments of the circle to the region of the
hidden little index, then you will know that eclipse will be a solar
eclipse. On the other hand, you will know that it will be a lunar
eclipse, if the index (moved by hand) has carried the moon, situated
between the two smaller segments of the circle, to the same region
(i.e., the hidden part of the circle). The solar disk and the lunar disk
alternately will reveal to you the circumstances of both eclipses. The
current year will be given by the Julian period, reducible to any
desired epoch, and, contained in the solar cycle, the golden number and
the Roman cycle. The month of the year and also the day of the month
will be indicated by the pointer of the little index, first on the right
side of the clock. And what I have said of future eclipses should be
equally understood of past eclipses, so long as the index, which can be
moved either way at will, is moved in reverse.

Finally, though 55 wheels were employed to carry so many dials, all are
driven by one source of power not exceeding the third part of a Germanic
hundred-weight which, suspended at the geometric height of five feet
(about the ordinary stature of a man), keeps the whole machine in
operation for a hundred days and more.

Although the machine repeats hours and quarter hours at will and,
consequently, the number of wheels and the rest of the apparatus
necessary for these functions is thereby increased, it has not grown to
an unwieldy size, however much one might erroneously imagine it to be.
It does not exceed the bulk of ordinary clocks hanging from a wall;
indeed, it scarcely equals these.

The entire machine, ready for operation, does not weigh more than 156
ounces, although it is made of steel or brass throughout and further
weighted with two bells and a rather large brass dial-plate.

Of course, there are many more things to be said, especially about the
mechanical structure of the wheels, but fearing to tire my kind reader
unduly by exceeding the bounds of a summary, I am forced to put an end,
though unwillingly, to this sufficiently shortened explanation of the
work. I have hope of giving satisfaction to many more when I shall have
communicated to the learned world another and completely new automatic
work, grander than this present one. It is already theoretically
completed in all its calculations, but still to be worked out
mechanically from the very beginning, if but God, thrice Best and
Greatest, bless the undertaking and mercifully grant life and health&mdash;to
whom be in, and from, and through all things, all honor and glory in
eternity and beyond.

THE ENGINEERING CONTRIBUTIONS OF WENDEL BOLLMAN



The development of structural engineering has always been as
dependent upon the availability of materials as upon the
expansion of theoretical concepts. Perhaps the greatest single
step in the history of civil engineering was the introduction
of iron as a primary structural material in the 19th century;
it quickly released the bridge and the building from the
confines of a technology based upon the limited strength of
masonry and wood.

Wendel Bollman, self-taught Baltimore civil engineer, was the
first to evolve a system of bridging in iron to be consistently
used on an American railroad, becoming one of the pioneers who
ushered in the modern period of structural engineering.

The Author: Robert M. Vogel
is curator of civil engineering in the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s
Museum of History and Technology.


Wendel Bollman&rsquo;s name survives today solely in association with the
Bollman truss, and even in this respect is known only to a few older
civil and railroad engineers. The Bollman system of trussing, along with
those of Whipple and Fink, may be said to have introduced the great age
of the metal bridge, and thus, directly, the modern period of civil
engineering.

Bollman&rsquo;s bridge truss, of which the first example was built in 1850,
has the very significant distinction of being the first bridging system
in the world employing iron in all of its principal structural members
that was used consistently on a railroad.

The importance of the transition from wood to iron as a structural and
bridge building material is generally recognized, but it may be well to
mention certain aspects of this change.

The tradition of masonry bridge construction never attained the great
strength in this country which it held in Europe, despite a number of
notable exceptions. There were several reasons for this. From the very
beginning of colonization, capital was scarce, a condition that
prevailed until well into the 19th century and which prohibited the use
of masonry because of the extremely high costs of labor and transport.
An even more important economic consideration was the rapidity with
which it was necessary to extend the construction of railways during
their pioneer years. Unlike the early English and European railways,
which invariably traversed areas of dense population and industrial
activity, and were thus assured of a significant financial return almost
from the moment that the first rail was down, the

Baltimore and Ohio
and its contemporaries were launched upon an entirely different
commercial prospect. Their principal business consisted not so much in
along-the-line transactions as in haulage between principal terminals
separated by great and largely desolate expanses. This meant that income
was severely limited until the line was virtually complete from end to
end, and it meant that commencement of return upon the initial
investment was entirely dependent upon the speed of survey, graduation,
tunneling, and bridging.

The need for speed, the general attenuation of capital, and the simple
fact that all the early railroads traversed thickly forested areas
rendered wood the most logical material for bridge and other
construction, both temporary and permanent.

The use of wood as a bridge material did not, of course, originate with
the railroads, or, for that matter, in this country. The heavily wooded
European countries&mdash;Switzerland in particular&mdash;had a strong tradition of
bridge construction in timber from the Renaissance on, and naturally a
certain amount of this technique found its way to the New World with the
colonials and immigrants.

America&rsquo;s highway system was meager until about the time the railroad
age itself was beginning. However, by 1812 there were, along the eastern
seaboard, a number of fine timber bridges of truly remarkable structural
sophistication and workmanship.

It was just previous to the advent of the railroads that the erection of
highway bridges in this country began to pass from an art to a science.
And an art it had been in the hands of the group of skilled but
unschooled master carpenters and masons who built largely from an
intuitive sense of proportion, stress, and the general &ldquo;fitness of
things.&rdquo; It passed into an exact science under the guidance of a small
number of men trained at first in the scientific and technical schools
of Europe, and, after about 1820, in the few institutions then
established in America that offered technical instruction.

The increasing number of trained engineers at first affected highway
bridge construction not so much in the materials used but in the way
they were assembled. In a bridge designed by a self-taught constructor,
the cheapness of wood made it entirely feasible to proportion the
members by enlarging them to the point where there could be no question
as to their structural adequacy. The trained engineer, on the other
hand, could design from the standpoint of determining the entire load
and then proportioning each element according to the increment of stress
upon it and to the unit capacity of the material.

By the time railroads had started expanding to the West there had been
sufficient experience with the half dozen practical timber truss systems
by then evolved, that there was little difficulty in translating them
into bridges capable of supporting the initial light rail traffic.

In spite of its inherent shortcomings, wood was so adaptable that it met
almost perfectly the needs of the railroads during the early decades of
their intense expansion, and, in fact, still finds limited use in the
Northwest.



Early Career

Wendel Bollman was born in Baltimore of German parents in 1814. His
father was a baker, who in the same year had aided in the city&rsquo;s defense
against the
[81]
British. Wendel&rsquo;s education, until about the age of 11, was
more or less conventionally gained in public and private schools in
Baltimore. He then entered into informal apprenticeship, first to an
apothecary in Sheperdstown, Virginia (now West Virginia), and then to
one in Harpers Ferry. In 1826 or 1827 he became ill and returned to
Baltimore for cure. From that time on his education was entirely
self-acquired.

It is of interest, in light of his later career, to note that on the
Fourth of July 1828, he marched with other boys in a procession that was
part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&rsquo;s cornerstone-laying ceremony.
Shortly afterward, he apprenticed himself to a carpenter for a brief
time, but when the work slacked off he obtained work with the B. &amp; O.
The right-of-way had been graded for about five miles by that time, but
no rail was down. The boy was at first given manual work, but soon
advanced to rodman and rapidly rose as he gained facility with the
surveying apparatus. In the fall of 1829 he participated in laying the
first track. As his mother was anxious that he continue his education in
carpentry, he left the railroad in the spring of 1830 to again enter
apprenticeship. He finished, became a journeyman, helped build a
planter&rsquo;s mansion in Natchez, and returned to Baltimore in 1837 to
commence his own carpentry business. The next year, while building a
house in Harpers Ferry, he was asked to rejoin the B. &amp; O. to rebuild
parts of its large timber bridge over the Potomac there, which had
fallen victim to various defects after about a year&rsquo;s use.

independent trussing systems. Bollman&rsquo;s use of this method of support
led to the development of his bridge truss. This drawing is of a
temporary span used after the timber bridge at Harpers Ferry was
destroyed during the Civil War. (In Baltimore and Ohio Collection,
Museum of History and Technology.)


Shortly after the Harpers Ferry bridge reconstruction, Bollman
was made foreman of bridges. It is apparent that, on the basis of
his practical ability,
[82]
enhanced by the theoretical knowledge gained by intense
self-study, he eventually came to assist Chief Engineer Benjamin H.
Latrobe in bridge design. He later took this work over entirely as
Latrobe&rsquo;s attentions and talents were demanded in the location and
extension of the line between Cumberland and Wheeling.




Figure 5.&mdash;Bollman&rsquo;s original patent drawing, 1851. (In
National Archives, Washington, D.C.)


The B. &amp; O. did not reach its logical destination, Ohio (actually
Wheeling, West Virginia, on the east bank of the Ohio River) until 1853.
In the years following Bollman&rsquo;s return to the railroad, the design of
bridges was an occupation of the engineering staff second in importance
only to the location of the line itself. During this time Bollman
continued to rise and assume greater responsibilities, being appointed
master of road by Latrobe in 1848. In this position he was responsible
for all railroad property that did not move, principally the
right-of-way and its structures, including, of course, bridges.

The recognition of Bollman&rsquo;s abilities was in the well-established
tradition of the B. &amp; O., long known as America&rsquo;s first &ldquo;school of
engineering,&rdquo; having sponsored many early experiments in motive power,
trackwork, and other fundamental elements of railroad
[83]
engineering. It
furnished the means of expression for such men as Knight, Wright,
Whistler, Latrobe, and Winans.

Latrobe. The second Winchester track was later removed.


Of these pioneer civil and mechanical engineers, some were formally
trained but most were self-taught. Bollman&rsquo;s career on the B. &amp; O. is of
particular interest not only because he was perhaps the most successful
of the latter class but because he was probably also the last. He may be
said to be a true representative of the transitional period between
intuitive and exact engineering. Actually, his designing was a composite
of the two methods. While making consistent use of mathematical
analysis, he was at the same time more or less dependent upon empirical
methods. For years, B. &amp; O. employees told stories of his sessions in
the tin shop of the railroad&rsquo;s main repair facility at Mount Clair in
Baltimore, where he built models of bridges from scraps of metal and
then tested them to destruction to locate weaknesses. It seems most
likely, however, that the empirical studies were used solely as checks
against the mathematical.

Bollman&rsquo;s published description and drawings of the structure. (USNM

In the period when Bollman began designing&mdash;about 1840&mdash;there were fewer
than ten men in the country designing bridges by scientifically correct
analytical methods, Whipple and Roebling the most notable of this group.
By 1884, the year of Bollman&rsquo;s death,
[84]
the age of intuitive design had
been dead for a decade or longer.

span&rdquo; of 1851 is seen at the right end of Latrobe&rsquo;s timber structure of
1836, which forms the body of the bridge. (Photo courtesy of Harpers
Ferry National Historical Park.)


The B. &amp; O. was in every way a truly pioneer enterprise. It was the
first practical railroad in America; the first to use an American
locomotive; the first to cross the Alleghenies. The spirit of innovation
had been encouraged by the railroad&rsquo;s directors from the outset. It
could hardly have been otherwise in light of the project&rsquo;s elemental
daring.

The first few major bridges beyond the line&rsquo;s starting point on Pratt
Street, in Baltimore, were of rather elaborate masonry, but this may be
explained by the projectors&rsquo; consciousness of the railroad&rsquo;s
significance and their desire for permanence. However, the
aforementioned economic factors shortly made obvious the necessity of
departure from this system, and wood was thereafter employed for most
long spans on the line as far as Harpers Ferry and beyond. Only the most
minor culverts and short spans, and those only in locations near
suitable quarries, were built of stone.

In addition to the economic considerations which prompted the company to
revert to timber for the major bridges, there were several situations in
which masonry construction was unsuitable for practical reasons. If
stone arches were used in locations where the grade of the line was a
relatively short distance above the surface of the stream to be crossed,
a number of short arches would have been necessary to avoid a very flat
single arch. In arch construction,
[85]
the smaller the segment of a circle
represented by the arch (that is, the flatter the arch), the greater the
stress in the arch ring and the resulting horizontal thrust on the
abutments.

Daniels), Maryland, built in 1853-1854. (Photo courtesy of Maryland
Historical Society.)


The piers for the numerous arches necessary to permit an optimum amount
of rise relative to the span would have presented a dangerous
restriction to stream flow in time of flood. By the use of timber
trusses such crossings could be made in one or two spans with, at the
most, one pier in the stream, thus avoiding the problem.

The principal timber bridges as far west as Cumberland were of Latrobe&rsquo;s
design. These were good, solid structures of composite construction, in
which a certain amount of cast iron was used in joints and wrought iron
for certain tension members. They were, however, more empirical than
efficient and, for the most part, not only grossly overdesigned but of
decidedly difficult fabrication and construction.

What is interesting about the Latrobian timber trusses, however, is the
effect they appear to have had upon Bollman&rsquo;s subsequent work in the
design of his own truss. This effect is evidenced by the marked analogy
between the primary structural elements of the two types. The Latrobe
truss at Elysville (fig.&nbsp;2) was only partially a truss, inasmuch as the
greater part of the load was not carried from panel to panel, finally to
appear at the abutments as a pure vertical reaction, but was carried
from each panel (except the four at the center) directly to the bearing
points at the piers by heavy diagonal struts, after the fashion of the
famous 18th-century Swiss trusses of the Grubenmanns. It was a
legitimate structural device, and the simplest means of extending the
capacity of a spanning system. However, it was defective in that the
struts applied considerable horizontal thrust to the abutments,
requiring heavier masonry than would otherwise have been necessary.

It is quite likely that Latrobe did not have absolute confidence in the
various pure truss systems already patented by Town, Long, and others,
and preferred for such strategic service a structure in which the panel
members acted more or less independently of one another. It will be seen
that, similarly, the individual panel loads in Bollman&rsquo;s truss were
carried to the ends of the frame by members acting independently of one
another.



The Bollman Truss

There had never been any question about the many serious inadequacies of
wood as a bridge material. Decay and fire risk, always present, were the
principal ones, involving continuous expenditure for replacement of
defective members and for fire watches. It was, in fact, understood by
the management and engineering staff of the B. &amp; O. that their timber
bridge superstructures, though considered the finest in the country,
were more or less expedient and were eventually to be replaced. In this
regard it is not surprising that Latrobe, a man of considerable
foresight, had, at an early date, given serious thought to the possible
application of iron here.

The world&rsquo;s first major iron bridge, the famed cast-iron arch at
Coalbrookdale, England, had been constructed in 1779. Its erection was
followed by rather sporadic interest in this use of the material. The
first significant use of iron in this country was in a series of small
trussed highway arches erected by Squire Whipple over the Erie Canal in
the early 1840&rsquo;s, over 60 years later. In these, as in most of the
earlier iron structures, an arch of cast iron was the primary support.
The thrust of the arches was counteracted by open wrought-iron links
with other wrought- and cast-iron members contributing to the truss
action.

The Whipple bridges promoted a certain amount of interest in the
material. In the B. &amp; O.&rsquo;s annual report for the fiscal year 1849
appears the first record of Latrobe&rsquo;s interest in this important matter.
In the president&rsquo;s message is found the following, rather offhand,
statement:

$6,183.19 have been expended toward the
renewal of the Stone Bridges on the Washington Branch, carried
off by the flood of Oct. 7th, 1847. Preparations are made and
[88]
contracts entered
into, for the reconstruction of the large Bridges at Little
Patuxent and at Bladensburg which will be executed in a few
months&#8230;. It is proposed to erect a superstructure of Iron
upon stone abutments, at each place&mdash;with increased span, for
greater security against future floods.

It is interesting to note that it was indeed Bollman trusses to which
the president of the railroad had referred. How much earlier than this
date Bollman had evolved his peculiar trussing system is not clear. The
certain influence of Latrobe&rsquo;s radiating strut system of trussing has
been mentioned. As likely an influence was another basic technique
commonly used to increase the capacity of a simple timber beam&mdash;that of
trussing&mdash;i.e., placing beneath the beam a rod of iron that was anchored
at the ends of the beam and held a certain distance below it at the
center by a vertical strut or post. This combination thus became a truss
in that the timber portion was no longer subject to a bending stress but
to a simple one of compression, the rod absorbing the tensile stress of
the combination. The effect was to deepen the beam, increasing the
distance between its extreme fibers and&mdash;by thus reducing the bending
moment&mdash;reducing the stress in them (see fig.&nbsp;3).




Figure 13.&mdash;The
four Bollman spans at Harpers Ferry that
survived the Civil War. The spans were completed in 1862-1863. (Photo

It apparently occurred to Bollman that by extending the number of rods
in a longitudinal direction, this effect could be practically amplified
to such an extent as to be capable of spanning considerable distances.
He almost certainly did not at first contemplate an all-iron system, but
rather a composite one such as described. It is entirely likely that
such trussed beams, with multiple systems of tension rods, were used by
Bollman as bridging in temporary trestlework along the line as early as
1845 (see fig.&nbsp;4).

It is impossible to say whether Bollman himself, or Latrobe, was struck
with the logic of further elaborating upon the system and,
simultaneously, translating the timber compression member into one of
cast iron. Cast iron would naturally have been selected for a member
that resisted a compressive stress, as it was considerably cheaper than
wrought iron. But more important, at that time wrought iron was not
available in shapes of sufficient sectional area to resist the
appreciable buckling stresses induced in long compression members. The
cost of building up members to sufficient size from the very limited
selection of small shapes then rolled would have been prohibitive.

The trussing rods, subjected to tension, were of wrought iron inasmuch
as the sectional area had only to be sufficient to resist the primary
axial stress.

The first all-iron Bollman truss was constructed over the Little
Patuxent River at Savage Factory, near Laurel, Maryland, in 1850. In the
chief engineer&rsquo;s report for the year 1850, Latrobe was able to state
that the truss had been completed and was giving
[89]
&ldquo;much satisfaction.&rdquo;
He went on at some length to praise the &ldquo;valuable mechanical features&rdquo;
embodied therein, and expressed great confidence that iron would become
as important a material in the field of civil engineering as it was in
mechanical engineering.




Figure 14.&mdash;The
Harpers Ferry bridge as completed after
the Civil War. It was used by the Baltimore and Ohio until 1894, and as
a highway bridge until 1936. (Photo 690, Baltimore and Ohio Collection,
Museum of History and Technology.)


The cost of this first major Bollman bridge was $23,825.00. Its span was
76 feet. Latrobe&rsquo;s confidence was well placed. The Savage span and
another at Bladensburg may be considered successful pilot models, for,
in spite of a certain undercurrent of mistrust of iron bridges within
the engineering profession&mdash;due mainly to a number of failures of
improperly designed spans&mdash;Latrobe felt there was sufficient
justification for the unqualified adoption of iron in all subsequent
major bridge structures on the B. &amp; O.

Almost immediately following completion of the Savage Bridge, Bollman
undertook the design of replacements for the large Patapsco River span
at Elysville (now Daniels), Maryland, and the so-called Winchester span
of the B. &amp; O.&rsquo;s largest and most important bridge, that over the
Potomac at Harpers Ferry. Harpers Ferry bridge, a timber structure, had
been designed by Latrobe and built in 1836-1837 by the noted bridge
constructor Lewis Wernwag. It was peculiar in having a turnout, near the
Virginia shore, whereby a subsidiary road branched off to Winchester
(see fig.&nbsp;6). Only the single span on this line, situated between the
midriver switch and the shore, was slated for replacement, as the other
seven spans of the bridge had been virtually reconstructed in the decade
or so of their history and were in sound condition at the time.


The Winchester span (fig.&nbsp;8), which was the first Bollman truss to
embody sufficient refinement of detail to be considered a prototype, was
completed in 1851. Bollman was extremely proud of the work, with perfect
justification it may be said. The 124-foot span was fabricated in the
railroad&rsquo;s extensive Mount Clair shops. It was subdivided into eight
panels by seven struts and seven pairs of truss rods. An interesting
difference between this span and Bollman&rsquo;s succeeding bridges was his
use of granite rather than cast iron for the towers. The span consisted
of three parallel lines of trussing to accommodate a common road in
addition to the single-track Winchester line.

The distinctive feature of the Bollman system was the previously
mentioned series of diagonal truss links in combination with a cast-iron
compression chord, which Bollman called the &ldquo;stretcher.&rdquo; The spacing
between the chord and the junction of each pair of
[90]
links was maintained by a vertical post or strut, also cast.




Figure 15.&mdash;North Street (now Guilford Avenue) bridge,
Baltimore. In this transitional composite structure cast iron was used
only in the relatively short sections of the upper chord. For the long
unsupported compression members of the web system, standard wrought-iron
angles and channels were built up into a large section. The decorative
cast-iron end posts were non-structural. (Photo in the L. N. Edwards
Collection, Museum of History and Technology.)


Much of the appeal of this design lay unquestionably in the sense of
security derived from the fact that each of the systems acted
independently to carry its load to the abutments. The lower chords,
actually nonfunctional in the primary structure, were included merely to
preserve the proper longitudinal spacing between the lower ends of the
struts. A certain lack of rigidity was inherent in the system due to
that very discontinuity which characterized its action; however, this
was compensated for by a pair of light diagonal stay rods crossing each
panel. These rods served the additional function of distributing
concentrated loads to adjacent struts much in the manner of the bridging
between floor joists in a building.

In the Winchester span the floor system was of timber for reasons of
economy. This was a very minor weakness inasmuch as any stick could be
quickly replaced, and without disturbing the function of the structure.
Bollman received a patent for his truss in January 1852, and in the same
year published a booklet describing his system in general and the
Harpers Ferry span in particular. Here, he first calls it a &ldquo;suspension
and trussed bridge,&rdquo; which is indeed an accurate designation for a
system which is not strictly a truss because it has no active lower
chord. (The analogy to a suspension bridge is quite clear, each pair of
primary rods being comparable to a suspension cable.) Thereafter,
Bollman&rsquo;s invention was generally termed a suspension truss.


INFLUENCE OF THE TRUSS

Bollman&rsquo;s 1852 publication was widely disseminated here and abroad and
studied with respectful interest by the engineering profession. Its
drawings of the structure were copied in a number of leading technical
journals in England and Germany. Although there is no record that the
type was ever reproduced in Europe, there can be little doubt that this
successful structural use of iron by the most eminent railroad in the
United States and its endorsement by an engineer of Latrobe&rsquo;s status
gave great impetus to the general adoption of the material. This
influence was certainly equal to that of Stephenson&rsquo;s tubular iron
bridge of 1850 over the Menai Strait, or Roebling&rsquo;s iron-wire suspension
bridge of 1855 over Niagara gorge. The Bollman design had perhaps even
greater influence, as the B. &amp; O. immediately launched the system with
great energy and in great numbers to replace its timber spans; on the
other hand, Roebling&rsquo;s structure was never duplicated in railroad
service, and Stephenson&rsquo;s only once.

EVALUATION OF THE TRUSS

By the late 1850&rsquo;s iron was well established as a bridge material
throughout the world. Once the previous fears of iron had been stilled
and the attention of engineers was directed to the interpretation of
existing and new spanning methods into metal, the Bollman truss began to
suffer somewhat from the comparison. Although its components were simple
to fabricate and its analysis and design were straightforward, it was
less economical of material than the more conventional panel trusses
such as the Pratt and Whipple types. Additionally, there was the
requisite amount of secondary metal in lower chords and braces necessary
for stability and rigidity.

A factor difficult to assess is Bollman&rsquo;s handling of his patent, which
was renewed in 1866. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that he
considered the patent valuable because it was based upon a sound design.
Therefore, he probably established a high license fee which, with the
truss&rsquo;s other shortcomings, was sufficient to discourage its use by
other railroads. As patron, the B. &amp; O. had naturally had full rights to
its use.

An additional defect, acknowledged even by Bollman, arose because of the
unequal length of the links in each group except the center one. This
caused an unevenness in the thermal expansion and contraction of the
framework, with the result that the bridges were difficult to keep in
adjustment. This had the practical effect of virtually limiting the
system to intermediate span lengths, up to about 150 feet. For longer
spans the B. &amp; O. employed the truss of another of Latrobe&rsquo;s assistants,
German-born and technically trained Albert Fink.

The Fink truss was evolved contemporaneously with Bollman&rsquo;s and was
structurally quite similar, being a suspension truss with no lower
chord. The principal difference was the symmetry of Fink&rsquo;s plan, which
was achieved by carrying the individual panel loads from the panel
points to increasingly longer panel units before having them appear at
the end bearings. This eliminated the weakness of unequal strains. The
design was basically a more rational one, and it came to be widely used
in spans of up to 250 feet, generally as a deck-type truss (see
fig.&nbsp;11).



W. Bollman and Company

Bollman resigned from the Baltimore and Ohio in 1858 to form, with John
H. Tegmeyer and John Clark, two of his former B. &amp; O. assistants, a
bridge-building firm in Baltimore known as W. Bollman and Company. This
was apparently the first organization in the United States to design,
fabricate, and erect iron bridges and structures, pioneering in what 25
years later had become an immense industry. The firm had its foundation
at least as early as 1855 when advertisements to supply designs and
estimates for Bollman bridges appeared over Tegmeyer&rsquo;s name in several
railroad journals (see fig.&nbsp;12).

Bollman&rsquo;s separation from the B. &amp; O. was not a complete one. The
railroad continued its program of replacing timber bridges with Bollman
trusses, and contracted with W. Bollman and Company for design
[92]
and a certain amount of fabrication. There is some likelihood that eventually
fabrication was entirely discontinued at Mount Clair, and all parts
subsequently purchased from Bollman.

The firm prospered, erecting a number of major railroad bridges in
Mexico, Cuba, and Chile. Operations ceased from 1861 to 1863 because of
difficult wartime conditions in the border city of Baltimore. Following
this, Bollman reentered business as sole proprietor of the Patapsco
Bridge and Iron Works.





Figure 17.&mdash;Chicago,
Burlington and Quincy Railroad bridge over Quincy
Bay (branch of the Mississippi River) at Quincy, Illinois. The pivot
draw-span was formed of two Bollman deck trusses supported at their
outer ends by hog chains. The bridge was built in 1867-1868 by the
Detroit Bridge and Iron Co., Bollman licensee. (Clarke, Account of the
Iron Railway Bridge &#8230; at Quincy, Illinois.)


The most noteworthy of Bollman&rsquo;s works in this period was a series of
spans at Harpers Ferry. The B. &amp; O.&rsquo;s timber bridge had been destroyed
by Confederate forces in June 1861, and the crossing was thereafter made
upon temporary trestlework. This was a constant source of trouble, with
continuing interruptions of the connection from high water, washouts,
and military actions. The annoyance and expense of this became so great
that the company decided to risk an iron bridge at the crossing. In July
and August 1862, two sections of Bollman truss, spans no. 4 and no. 5
were completed. As this occurred during the time when W. Bollman and
Company was inoperative, the work was produced at Mount Clair to
Bollman&rsquo;s design and, undoubtedly, erected under his supervision. Five
weeks later, on September 24, these and Bollman&rsquo;s famous Winchester span
of 1851 were blown up by the Confederates, and the line&rsquo;s business was
again placed at the mercy of trestling.

The spirit of the B. &amp; O. administration indeed seems to have been
unshakable when, in the face of such heartbreaking setbacks, it
determined to again bridge the river with iron, even at the height of
the hostilities. In November, span no. 5 was erected, and by April 1863
nos. 3, 4, and 6 also. These were the four straight spans in midriver
between the &ldquo;wide&rdquo; (or &ldquo;branch,&rdquo; or &ldquo;wye&rdquo;) span and the span on the
Maryland shore over the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (see fig.&nbsp;13).
Although the wood floor system of these spans was burned for strategic
reasons by U.S. troops later in 1863, they survived the war.

In 1868 the remaining trestlework was replaced with Bollman trusses.
This magnificent structure served the railroad until 1894 when the
right-of-way was realigned at Harpers Ferry. However, the half used by
the common road remained in use until carried away by the disastrous
flood in 1936. The piers may still be seen.

During the prewar years, Bollman evolved a structural development of
most profound importance, which is usually associated with the Phoenix
Iron Works and its founder, Samuel J. Reeves. In the erection of a high
trestlework viaduct for the Havana Railroad, Bollman apparently became
concerned with the tensile weakness of cast iron when applied in long,
unsupported columns. Although a column is normally subjected to
compressive stresses, when the slenderness ratio&mdash;that is, the length
divided by the radius of gyration of the cross section&mdash;becomes great, a
secondary bending stress may be produced. If this stress becomes great
enough, the value of the tensile stress in one side of the column may
actually exceed the principal compressive stress, and a net effect of
tension result.

[94]

As already mentioned, the few available rolled-iron shapes were of
relatively small area and quite unsuitable for use as columns unless
combined and built up in complex fabrications. The normal practice at
the time was to use cast compression members in iron bridges and
structures, with their sectional area so proportioned to the length that
a state of tension could not exist. In the case of long members, this
naturally meant that an excessive amount of material was used.





Figure 20.&mdash;Two views
of Bollman-built &ldquo;water-pipe truss&rdquo; that carries

Bollman was conscious of the problem from his experience with the
stretchers and struts of his truss, and he must have been aware of the
great advantage which would be obtained by a practical method of forming
such members in wrought iron, the tensile resistance of which is
equivalent to the compressive. He eventually developed the forerunner of
what came to be known as the Phoenix form by having special segmental
wrought-iron shapes rolled by Morris, Tasker and Company of
Philadelphia, these shapes being combined into a circular
section with out
[95]
standing flanges for riveting together. The circular section is
theoretically the most efficient to bear compressive loading. A column
of any required diameter could be produced by simply increasing the
number of segments, the individual size of which never exceeded
contemporary rolling mill capacity (see fig.&nbsp;16).

The design exhibits the inspired combination of functional perfection
and simplicity that seems to characterize most great inventions.

It may have been because he had no facilities for rolling that Bollman
communicated his idea to Reeves, although this seems illogical. At any
rate, Reeves and his associates patented the system extensively, and the
Phoenix column was eventually employed to the virtual exclusion of
cast-iron and other types of wrought-iron columns. By the end of the
19th century it began to pass from use, as mills became capable of
producing larger sections with properties relatively favorable to column
use and more adaptable to connection with other members.



Final Use of the Bollman Truss

The Bollman truss found occasional use elsewhere than on the B. &amp; O.
lines, but generally only when erected on contract by Patapsco Bridge
and Iron Works. However, the fact that Bollman could profitably erect
this bridge in the severely competitive 1870&rsquo;s indicates that the harsh
criticism of the system by authorities of such stature as Whipple was
not necessarily justified. Bollman&rsquo;s advertisements, in fact, refer to
the favorable recommendations of other
[96]
such renowned engineers as
Herman Haupt and M. C. Meigs.

History and Technology.)


An interesting application of the system was in a drawbridge, formed of
two Bollman deck spans, over an arm of the Mississippi at Quincy,
Illinois (see fig.&nbsp;17). The first iron bridge in Mexico was erected by
Bollman over the MedellÃ­n River about 1864. Another work of this period,
which attracted considerable attention, was a pair of bridges that
Bollman erected over North Carolina&rsquo;s Cape Fear River in 1867-1868.
These bridges were notable for their foundation on cast-iron cylinders,
sunk pneumatically. This was one of the first instances of the use of
the process in America, and the depth of 80 feet below the water surface
reached by one cylinder was considered remarkable for years afterward.

In the last active decade or so of his career, Bollman produced hundreds
of minor bridges and other structures. In 1873 he supplied the castings
for the splendid iron dome of Baltimore&rsquo;s City Hall and erected the
ingenious water-main truss which carries Lombard Street over Jones Falls
in that city. In this structure the top and bottom chords of the central
line of trussing are cast-iron water mains, bifurcated at the abutments,
and joined by cast- and wrought-iron web members
(see fig.&nbsp;20).

[97]

In the mid 1870&rsquo;s Bollman saw his truss pass into obsolescence. This was
due primarily to the generally increasing distrust of cast iron for
major structural members due to its brittleness, but advances in
structural theory, availability of a greater variety of rolled
structural shapes, and the increasing loading patterns of the period all
contributed.




Figure 23.&mdash;The only
surviving Bollman truss bridge, at Savage, Maryland. The bridge
was built elsewhere in 1852 and was moved to this now-abandoned
Baltimore and Ohio industrial siding in about 1888.


Although no Bollman trusses were built by Bollman or the B. &amp; O. after
1875, those in use were only removed as required by heavier motive
power. The Harpers Ferry span, as noted, remained in full main-line
service until 1894. Bollman trusses on feeder lines were continued in
use until much later; a number of them on the Valley Railroad of
Virginia (see fig.&nbsp;22) were not removed until 1923. However, only on the
most isolated spurs was the Bollman truss permitted to reach really ripe
age. The sole known remaining example (fig.&nbsp;23) stands on such a
branch&mdash;ironically, at Savage, over the Little Patuxent, the site of the
first Bollman span. This is not the 1850 bridge, but one built in 1852
and moved to the present site 30 years later. The fate of the first span
is not known.

rail of accurate section and ties. Spouts are in simulation of hexagonal
sheet-iron chimneys, with seams riveted, and the handles are in the form

WENDEL BOLLMAN&rsquo;S

Patent Iron Suspension Railroad Bridge.

The undersigned would inform the officers of
Railroads and others, that he is prepared to
furnish Drawings and Estimates for Bridges,
Roofs, etc., on the plan of Bollman&rsquo;s Patent.

The performance of these bridges, some of which
have been in use for six years, has given entire
satisfaction. Their simplicity of construction
renders repairs easy and cheap, and by a peculiar
connection of the Main and Panel Rods at the
bottom of the Posts, all danger from the effects
of expansion, which has heretofore been the chief
objection to Iron Bridges, is entirely removed.

J. H. TEGMEYER,

Screw-Thread Cutting by the
Master-Screw Method Since 1480
Edwin A. Battison



[106]

Edwin A. Battison

SCREW-THREAD CUTTING BY THE
MASTER-SCREW METHOD SINCE 1480


Among the earliest known examples of screw-thread cutting machines are
the screw-cutting lathe of 1483, known only in pictures and drawings,
and an instrument of the traverse-spindle variety for threading metal,
now in the Smithsonian Institution, dating from the late 17th or early
18th century. The author shows clearly their evolution from something
quite specialized to the present-day tool. He has traced the patents for
these instruments through the early 1930&rsquo;s and from this research we see
the part played by such devices in the development of the machine-tool
industry.

The Author: Edwin A. Battison is
associate curator of mechanical and civil engineering in the Smithsonian
Institution&rsquo;s Museum of History and Technology.


Directness and simplicity characterize
pioneer machine tools because
they were intended to accomplish some quite specialized task and the
need for versatility was not apparent. History does not reveal the
earliest forms of any primitive machines nor does it reveal much about
the various early stages in evolution toward more complex types. At best
we have discovered and dated certain developments as existing in
particular areas. Whether these forms were new at the time they were
first found or how widely dispersed such forms may have been is unknown.
Surviving evidence is in the form of pictures or drawings, such as the
little-known screw-cutting lathe of 1483 (fig.&nbsp;1) shown in Das
mittelalterliche Hausbuch.

This lathe shows that its builder had a keen perception of the necessary
elements, reduced to bare essentials, required to accomplish the object.
Present are the coordinate slides often credited to Henry Maudslay. His
slides are not, of course, associated with the spindle; neither is there
any natural law which compels them to guide the tool exactly parallel
with the axis of revolution. In this sense the screw-cutting lathe in
the Hausbuch is superior because it is in harmony with natural law and
can generate a true cylinder, whereas Maudslay&rsquo;s lathe can only transfer
to the work whatever accuracy is built into it.

In principle this machine shown in the Hausbuch is very advanced as we
see when we follow the design
[107]
through to the present time. The artist,
whose drawings give us our only knowledge of the machine, himself was
obviously not very familiar with the details of its function. Reference
to figure 1 shows that the threads on the lead screw and on the work,
wind in opposite directions. This must be an error in delineation since
the two are closely coupled together without any intervening mechanism
so that the only possible result on the work must be a thread winding in
the same direction as on the original screw. The work also is shown
threaded for its entire length; this cannot be accomplished with any one
location of the cross-slide. We are left with the question of whether
this slide was used in two locations or whether the artist, possibly
working from notes or an earlier rough sketch, failed to show an
unthreaded portion on one end or the other of the work.




Figure 1.&mdash;Earliest
representation found of a master-screw type of thread-cutting
machine. From the inconsistencies, such as right- and left-hand
threads on master and work, it appears that
the artist had scant insight into actual function. From plate 62 of Das
mittelalterliche Hausbuch, nach dem Originale im Besitze des F&uuml;rsten von
Waldburg-Wolfegg-Waldsee, im Auftrage des Deutschen Vereins f&uuml;r
Kunstwissenschaft, herausgegeben von Helmuth Th. Bossert und Willy F.
Storck (Leipzig: E. A. Seemann, 1912).

Of at least equal importance with the lead screw and work and their
relationship to each other is the tool-support with its screw-adjusted
cross-slide (fig.&nbsp;2). Just how this was attached to the frame of the
machine so that it placed the tool at a suitable radius is again a
questionable point. The very well-developed cutting tool is sharpened to
a thin, keen edge totally unsuited for cutting metal but ideal for use
on a softer, fibrous substance: undoubtedly wood, in this instance.
Unfortunately, the angle at which the artist chose to show us this
cutter is not a view from which it is possible to judge whether or not
the tool has been made to conform to the helix angle of the thread to be
cut. This cross-slide, in conjunction with the traversing work spindle,
gives us a machine having two coordinate slides yielding the same effect
as the slide rest usually attributed to Henry Maudslay at the end of the
18th century. Actually, an illustration of coordinate slides independent
of the spindle had been published as early as 1569 by
Besson
[1] and
knowledge of them widely disseminated by his popular work on mechanics.
These slides are shown as part of a screw-cutting machine with a
questionably adequate connection, by means of cords, between the master
screw and the work.

It was the author&rsquo;s pleasure recently to obtain for the Smithsonian
Institution and identify a small, nicely made, brass instrument which
had been in two collections in this country and one collection in
Germany as an unidentified locksmith&rsquo;s tool (fig.&nbsp;3).
[108]
This proved to be
an instrument of the traverse-spindle variety for threading metal.
Fortunately, all essential details were present including a cutter
(A in figure 4);
this instrument was identified by the signature &ldquo;Manuel
Wetschgi, Augspurg.&rdquo; The Wetschgis were a well-known family of gunsmiths
and mechanics in Augsburg through several generations. Two bore the
given name Emanuel: the earlier was born in 1678 and died in 1728. He
was quite celebrated in his field of rifle making and became chief of
artillery to the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel shortly before his death in
his 51st year. Little is known of the later Emanuel Wetschgi except that
he was at Augsburg in 1740. Tentative attribution of the instrument has
been made to the earlier Emanuel, chiefly on the basis of his recognized
position as an outstanding craftsman.




Figure 2.&mdash;Cross-slide
for the thread-cutting lathe of Das mittelalterliche Hausbuch,
shown in figure 1. It is remarkable not
only for its early date, but also for its high state of development with
a crossfeed screw which had not become universally accepted 300 years
later. The cutter, shown out of its socket, is obviously sharpened for
use on wood.

In several respects this little machine differs from its predecessor of
the Hausbuch, as might be expected when allowance is made for the
generations of craftsmen who undoubtedly worked with such tools over the
roughly 200 years of time separating them. Another factor to consider
when comparing these two machines is that one was used on metal, the
other probably only on wood. Therefore, it is not surprising to find on
the later machine an outboard or &ldquo;tailstock&rdquo; support for the work. The
spindle of this support has to travel in unison with the work-driving
spindle so that it is not an unexpected discovery to find that it is
spring-loaded. Figure 5 shows how this spring may be adjusted to
accommodate various lengths of work by moving the attachment screw to
various holes in both the spring and in the frame. Also visible in the
same illustration is a rectangular projection at the other end of the
spring which engages a mating hole in the &ldquo;tailstock&rdquo;
spindle to prevent its rotation.




Figure 3.&mdash;Small
thread-cutting lathe which was made to
be held in a vise during use. It was found as shown here, with only the
operating crank missing. The overall length is approximately 12 inches,
depending on the adjustment of parts. (Smithsonian photo 46525B.)

Figure 6 shows the traversing spindle and nut removed from the machine.
Provision has been
[109]
made for doing this so easily that there is every
reason to believe that, originally, there were various different spindle
and nut units which could be interchangeably used in the machine.
Additional evidence tending to support this concept exists in the
cutting tool (fig.&nbsp;4), which must have been intended for serious work as
it has been carefully fitted in its unsymmetrical socket. The cutting
blade of this tool, which works with a scraping rather than a true
cutting action, is too wide to form a properly proportioned thread when
used with the existing lead screw. This may well indicate that the tool
was made for use with a lead of coarser pitch, now lost.




Figure 4.&mdash;The
working area of figure 3, showing the tool
and signature. (Smithsonian photo 46525A.)

Perhaps the most startling feature of this machine when compared with
the machine of the Hausbuch, is the absence of a cross-slide for
adjusting the tool. Possibly this can be explained by the blunt scraping
edge on the tool. In actual use, recently, to cut a sample screw, using
a tool similar to the one found in the machine (fig.&nbsp;7), it was found
advantageous to be free of a cross-slide and thus be able to feed the
tool into the work by feel rather than by rule, as would be done with a
slide rest. In this way, it was possible to thread steel without
tearing, as the cutting pressure could readily be felt and the tool
could release itself from too heavy a cut. Size on several screws could
be repeated by setting the tool to produce the desired diameter when its
supporting arm came to rest against the frame of the machine. The screws
used in the machine itself were apparently made in just such a way. They
were not cut with a die as the thread blends very gradually into the
body of the screw without the characteristic marks left by the cutting
edges of a die. Threads cut with a single-point tool controlled by a
cross-slide usually end even more abruptly than those cut by a die,
while it would be quite simple with a machine of the nature we are
considering to bring the thread to a gentle tapering end as seen in
figure 8 (another view of the screw A
in fig.&nbsp;3) by gradually releasing the pressure
[110]
necessary to keep the tool cutting as the end of the
thread was approached.

against the work, showing the method and range of adjustment. Note the
rectangular projection to engage a mating socket in the
spindle, to
prevent spindle rotation. (Smithsonian photo 46525.)




Figure 6.&mdash;Work
spindle and its nut removed from the
machine to illustrate how easily another spindle and nut of different
pitch could be substituted. (Smithsonian photo 46525C.)

That machines of this general type having the lead screw on the axis of
the work were competitive with other methods and other types of machines
over a long period of time may be seen from figures
9 and 10. The
machine, left front in figure 9 and in more intimate detail in
figure 10, can be seen to differ little from that shown in Das
mittelalterliche Hausbuch of 1483. The double work-support is, of
course, a great improvement, while the tool-support is regressive since
it lacks a feed screw.

The development of engineering theory, coupled with the rising needs of
industry, particularly with the advent of the Industrial Revolution,
brought about accelerated development of screw-cutting lathes through
the combination of screw-cutting machines with simple lathes as seen in
figure 9 and in detail in
figure 11.
[111]
One important advance shown here
is driving the machine by means of a cord or band so that any means of
rotary power could be applied, not just hand or foot power. Of greater
interest and technical importance to this study is the provision, seen
to better advantage in figure 11, for readily changing from one master
lead screw to another. This had already been achieved in the Manuel
Wetschgi machine, as far as versatility is concerned, although not in
quite such a convenient way.

old screw and nut but with a new tool. The material threaded is

Figure 12, the headstock of another and more advanced lathe than shown
in figures 9 and 11 but of the same type, shows &ldquo;keys&rdquo;
(D), each of
which is a partial nut of different pitch to engage with a thread of
mating pitch. The dotted lines in figure 13 show the engaged and
disengaged positions of one of these keys, and figure 14 shows the
spindle with the various leads, C. At
D is a grooved collar to be
engaged by the narrow key shown in operating position at the left in
figure 12 for the purpose of controlling the endwise movement of the
spindle when used for ordinary turning instead of thread-cutting. In
return for greater convenience and freedom from the expense of the many
separate spindles, as typified by the Wetschgi machine, a sacrifice has
been made in the length of the thread which can be cut without
interruption.

[113]

This reduction in the length that could conveniently be threaded was no
great drawback on many classes of work. This can be realized from
figure 16 which shows a traverse-spindle lathe headstock typical of the
mid-19th century. During the years intervening between the machines of
figures 12 and 16, the general design was greatly improved by removing
the lead screws from the center of the spindle. This made possible a
shorter, much stiffer spindle and supported both ends of the spindle in
one frame or headstock rather than in separate pieces attached to the
bed. The screws were now mounted outside of the spindle-bearings, one at
a time, while the mating nuts were cut partially into the circumference
of a disk which could be turned to bring any particular nut into working
position as required. With this arrangement, a wide variety of leads
either right or left hand could be provided and additional leads could
be fitted at any future time. Screw-cutting lathes of this design were
popular for a very long time with instrument makers and opticians who
had little need to cut screws of great length.




Figure 11.&mdash;Details
of the threading lathe seen in the right foreground of
figure 9 showing the method of drive and support for
the work. From L&rsquo;Encyclop&eacute;die, vol. 9, plate 1.

The demands of expanding industry for greater versatility in the
production of engineering elements late in the 18th century set the
stage for the evolution of more complex machines tending to place the
threaded spindle lathes in eclipse. Maudslay&rsquo;s lathe of 1797-1800
(fig.&nbsp;15) appeared at this time when industry was receptive to rapid
innovation. Unfortunately, the gearing which once existed to connect the
headstock spindle with the lead screw has long been lost. At this time
it is quite difficult to say with certainty whether the original gear
set offered a variety of ratios, as was true of slightly later Maudslay
lathes, or a fixed ratio. The plausibility of the fixed ratio theory is
supported by the very convenient means, seen in figure 15, for removing
the lead screw in preparation for substitution of one of another pitch.
All that is required is to back off its supporting center at the
tailstock end and withdraw the screw from its split
nut
[2] and from the
driving clutch near the headstock. This split nut also would have to be
changed to one of a pitch corresponding to that of the screw. While more
expensive than a solid nut, it neatly circumvents the need (and saves
the time involved) to reverse the screw in order to get the tool back to
the point of beginning preliminary to taking another cut. David
Wilkinson&rsquo;s lathe of 1798 (fig.&nbsp;17) which was developed in Rhode Island
at the same time shows the same method of mounting and driving the
master screw. At least in the United States, this method of changing the
lead screw instead of using change gears remained popular for many
years. Examples of this changeable screw feature are to be found in the
lathes constructed for the pump factory of W. &amp; B. Douglas Company,
Middletown, Connecticut,
[3] in the 1830&rsquo;s.
Middletown, at that time one
of the leading metal-working centers in one of the chief industrial
States, had been for many years
[114]
the site of the Simeon North arms
factory which rivaled Whitney&rsquo;s. In this atmosphere, it is reasonable to
expect that machinery constructed by local mechanics, as was the custom
in those days, would reflect the most accepted refinements in machine
design.

Roughly twenty years later, Joseph Nason of New York
patented
[4] the
commercially very important &ldquo;Fox&rdquo; brassworker&rsquo;s lathe
(fig.&nbsp;18). While
this does have a ratio in the pair of gears connecting the work spindle
and master screw, it is clear from the patent that various pitches are
to be obtained by changing screws, not by changing gears. The patent
sums it up as follows:

A nut upon the end of the stud &#8230; is unscrewed when the guide
screw is to be removed or changed. The two wheels &#8230; should have
in their number of teeth a common multiple. They are seldom or
never removed and their diameters are made dissimilar only for the
purpose of giving to the guide screw a slower rate of motion than
that of the mandrel whereby it may be made of coarser pitch than
that of the screw to be cut and its wear materially lessened.

The introduction of gearing between the spindle and the lead screw, for
whatever purpose, could not help but introduce variable factors caused
by inaccuracies in the gears themselves and in their mounting. These
were of little consequence for common work, particularly when coupled to
a screw which, itself, was of questionable accuracy. The increasing
refinements demanded in scientific instruments and in machine tools
themselves after they had reached a relatively stable form dictated that
attention be dedicated to improved accuracy of the threaded components.

An attack on this problem, which interestingly reverts to the
fundamental principle of motion derived from a master screw without the
intervention of other mechanism (fig.&nbsp;19), is covered by a
patent
[5]
issued to Charles Vander Woerd, one-time superintendent of the Waltham
Watch Company. The problem is well stated in the patent:

This invention relates to the manufacture of leading screws to be
used for purposes requiring the highest attainable degree of
correctness in the cutting of the screw-threads of said screw &#8230;
as, for example, in machines for ruling lines in glass plates to
produce refraction [sic] gratings for the resolution of the lines
of the solar spectrum, such machines being required to rule many
thousands of lines on an inch of space by a marking device which is
reciprocated over the glass plate and is fed by the action of a
leading screw after the formation of each line. Great difficulty
has been experienced in constructing a leading screw for this and
other purposes, in which the thread is so nearly correct as to
produce no perceptible variation in the microscopic spaces between
the ruled lines or gratings&#8230;. Various causes prevent the
formation of a thread on the rod or blank, which is absolutely
uniform and accurate from end to end of the rod. Among other causes
are the variations of temperature from time to time, the
[117]
imperfections of the operating leading screw, the springing of the
leading screw and of the rod that is being threaded, and other
unavoidable causes, all of which, although apparently trivial and
producing only slight variations in the thread at different parts
of the rod or blank, are of sufficient moment to be seriously
considered when a screw of absolute accuracy is desired.

lathe, patented in 1854, showing a
master lead screw driven at less than work speed so that the master
could be of a coarser and more durable pitch than the work. U.S. patent
10383.


It is interesting to note in figure 19 that Vander Woerd&rsquo;s machine, to
avoid the problems outlined in his patent, has returned to a starkly
simple design. We are not told, however, how he originated this master
screw which is used to produce the accurately threaded work pieces.
Later generations, in the search for ever-greater accuracy, also
returned to the fundamental simplicity of a master screw as we shall see
when we consider the refinements in mechanism necessary to the extended
development of the automobile and the airplane.




Figure 19.&mdash;Vander
Woerd&rsquo;s patent, seen here, covered the
combination of a master screw, toolslide and work in a rigid frame to be
supported and driven by outside means of no required precision. U.S.
patent 293930 dated February 1884.

As the power and speed of automobiles and aircraft increased, critical
parts became more highly stressed. Gears and threaded parts were
particularly troublesome details of the mechanism because of the
stresses concentrated in them, and, in the case of gears, because of the
internal and external stresses originating in minute deviations from the
ideal of tooth form and spacing. The problems were not entirely
[118]
new but had hitherto been solved by increasing the size of the parts, an avenue
of limited utility to designers in these fields where total weight as
well as the effects of mass and inertia are so important. By making
these parts of heat-treated steel, the strength could be made suitable
while the size and mass of the parts were kept within bounds. The
necessary processes of heat-treating were not always applicable to
finished parts as they sometimes destroyed both finish and accuracy.
Grinding, which was well developed for the simple plane, cylindrical,
and conical surfaces so widely used in mechanisms, had to be extended to
threads and gears so that they could be finished after heat-treating.
Sometimes the gear teeth themselves were ground; for other applications
it was sufficient to improve the accuracy of the gear cutters.




Figure 20.&mdash;A
hob-grinding machine patented in 1932 and
incorporating the master-screw principle. Carl G. Olson&rsquo;s U.S. patent
1874592.

Attempts to produce gear hobs free of the imperfections and distortions
introduced by heat treatment led to another return to the use of the
master lead screw. Figure 20 illustrates a machine having this feature
which was patented in 1932 by Carl G.
Olson.
[6] In speaking of the
spindle-driving mechanism disclosed in earlier patents, the patent goes
on to say:

This driving mechanism includes an integral spindle 20, one
extremity thereof being designed for supporting a hob 22 and the
other extremity thereof being formed so as to present a lead screw
24. The spindle 20 is mounted between a bearing 26 and a bearing
28, the latter bearing providing a nut in which the lead screw 24
rotates&#8230;. From the description thus far given it will be apparent
that the rotation of the lead screw 24 within the bearing or nut 28
will cause the hob to be moved axially, the lead of the screw 24
being equal to the lead of the thread in the hob.

Claim 8 which concludes the descriptive portion of the patent states in
part:

In a hob grinding machine of the class described, a rotary work
supporting spindle, means for effecting
[119]
longitudinal movement of
the spindle, a tool holder for supporting a grinding wheel in
operative position with respect to the work supported by the
spindle during the rotary and longitudinal movement thereof, &#8230;

Even before this patent was applied for, another patent was pending for
the purpose of modifying the pitch of the lead screw without the use of
change gears in spite of the wide acceptance of such gear mechanisms for
over a hundred years.

hob-grinding machine of 1933, showing use
of the master screw with a modifier but without change gears. Carl G.
Olson&rsquo;s U.S. patent 1901926.




Figure 22.&mdash;A
sine-bar device to modify the effective
lead of a master lead screw without introducing a complex mechanism
which would be both difficult to make and to operate within the required
close limits. Carl G. Olson&rsquo;s (1933) U.S. patent 1901926.

Figure 21 shows a plan view
[7] of the machine,
and figure 22 a detailed
view of the sine-bar mechanism actuated by the master screw, 6, to
modify the effective pitch of the lead screw in accordance with the
realities of practice as stated in the preamble of the patent:


This invention relates to material working machines, and
particularly to machines such as hob grinders and the like, wherein
the work is reciprocated through the agency of a lead screw.

[120]

In the manufacture of hobs it is common practice to employ the same
machine for grinding hobs of varied diameters, and in order to
employ such a machine in this manner the pitch of the lead screw,
thereof, which actuates the work carrier, must conform to the axial
pitch of the hob to be ground. This will be readily apparent when
it is understood that the helix angles of hobs vary in accordance
with their diameters and, consequently, the difference between the
normal pitch and the axial pitch correspondingly varies. While the
requirement for the normal pitch may be the same for hobs of
different diameters, it is necessary to change the axial pitch in
accordance with a change in the hob diameter, and this axial pitch
of the hob is equal to the pitch of the lead screw which actuates
the work carrier in grinding machines heretofore used. Hence, in
order to adapt such machines to cover a wide range of leads, it is
necessary to provide a large number of interchangeable lead screws
and obviously this represents a large investment, and the
interchanging of these screws requires the expenditure of
considerable time in setting up the machine for each job.


Thread-grinding machines were being designed concurrent with the
development of hob-grinding machines. Many were entirely concerned with
features peculiar to the problems of wheel-dressing and to automatic
characteristics. An invention to embody the use of a master screw and
concerned with the precision grinding of worm threads, for use in
gearing, was patented by Frederick A. Ward in this
era.
[8] That part of
the invention pertaining to the use of a master screw, &ldquo;a rotary work
holder mounted on said carriage and provided with a driving spindle, an
exchangeable master screw and stationary nut detachably secured to said
spindle and head, &#8230;&rdquo; is shown in figure 23.

the use of a master lead screw to control the pitch of a precision worm
thread being ground. From the 1933 U.S. patent 1899654, of F. A. Ward&rsquo;s
worm-grinding machine.

Machines embodying the principle of the master lead screw are found in
constant use by industry at the present time for specialized
application. Whenever technological changes again reopen the topic of
thread-cutting to a new degree of accuracy or call for a reevaluation of
popular methods for any other reason, we may expect to see another
resurgence of the master-screw method, for no other design eliminates so
many variables or rests on such firm and fundamental natural principles
as the machine of Das mittelalterliche Hausbuch of 1483, the earliest
such machine now known.

THE EARLIEST ELECTROMAGNETIC INSTRUMENTS


The history of the early stages of electromagnetic instrumentation
is traced here through the men who devised the theories and
constructed the instruments.

Despite the many uses made of voltaic cells after Volta&rsquo;s
announcement of his &ldquo;pile&rdquo; invention in 1800, two decades passed
before Oersted discovered the magnetic effects of a voltaic circuit.
As a result of this and within a five-month period, three men,
apparently independently, announced the invention of the &ldquo;first&rdquo;
electromagnetic instrument. This article details the merits of their
claims to priority.

The Author: Robert A. Chipman is chairman of the Department of
Electrical Engineering at the University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio,
and consultant to the Smithsonian Institution.



Electrostatic Instruments before 1800

It is
the fundamental premise of instrument-science that a device for
detecting or measuring a physical quantity can be based on any
phenomenon associated with that physical quantity. Although the
instrumentation of electrostatics in the 18th century, for example,
relied mainly on the phenomena of attraction and repulsion and the
ubiquitous sparks and other luminosities of frictional electricity, even
the physiological sensation of electric shock was exploited
semiquantitatively by Henry Cavendish in his well-known anticipation of
Ohm&rsquo;s researches. Likewise, Volta in 1800
[1] described at length how the
application of his pile to suitably placed electrodes on the eyelids, on
the tongue, or in the ear, caused stimulation of the senses of sight,
taste and hearing; on the other hand, he reported that electrodes in the
nose merely produced a &ldquo;more or less painful&rdquo; pricking feeling, with no
impression of smell. The discharges from the Leyden jars of some of the
bigger frictional machines, such as van Marum&rsquo;s at Leyden, were found by
1785 to magnetize pieces of iron and to melt long pieces of metal
wire.
[2]

[124]

The useful instruments that emerged from all of this experience were
various deflecting &ldquo;electrometers&rdquo; and &ldquo;electroscopes&rdquo; (the words were
not carefully distinguished in use), including the important goldleaf
electroscope ascribed to Abraham Bennet in 1787.
[3]

In 1786, Galvani first observed the twitching of the legs of a dissected
frog produced by discharges of a nearby electrostatic machine, thereby
revealing still another &ldquo;effect&rdquo; of electricity. He then discovered that
certain arrangements of metals in contact with the frog nerves produced
the same twitching, implying something electrical in the frog-metal
situation as a whole. Although Galvani and his nephew Aldini drew from
these experiments erroneous conclusions involving &ldquo;animal electricity,&rdquo;
which were disputed by Volta in his metal-contact theory, it is
significant from the instrumentation point of view that the frog&rsquo;s legs
were unquestionably by far the most sensitive detector of metal-contact
electrical effects available at the time. Without their intervention the
development of this entire subject-area, including the creation of
chemical cells, might have been delayed many years. Volta himself
realized that the crucial test between his theory and that of Galvani
required confirming the existence of metal-contact electricity by some
electrical but nonphysiological detector. He performed this test
successfully with an electroscope, using the &ldquo;condensing&rdquo; technique he
had invented more than a decade earlier.


Instrumenting Voltaic or Galvanic Electricity, 1800-1820

In his famous letter of March 20, 1800, written in French from Como,
Italy, to the president of the Royal Society in London, Volta made the
first public announcement of both his &ldquo;pile&rdquo; (the first English
translator used the word &ldquo;column&rdquo;), and his &ldquo;crown of cups&rdquo; (the same
translator used &ldquo;chain of cups&rdquo; for Volta&rsquo;s &ldquo;couronne de tasses&rdquo;). The
former consisted of a vertical pile of circular disks, in which the
sequence copper-zinc-pasteboard, was repeated 10 or 20 or even as many
as 60 times, the pasteboard being moistened with salt water. The &ldquo;crown
of cups&rdquo; could be most conveniently made with drinking glasses, said
Volta, with separated inch-square plates of copper and zinc in salt
water in each glass, the copper sheet in one glass being joined by some
intermediate conductor and soldered joints to the zinc in the next
glass.

Volta considered the &ldquo;crown of cups&rdquo; and the &ldquo;pile&rdquo; to be essentially
identical, and as evidences of the electrical nature of the latter,
said:

&#8230; if it contains about 20 of these stories or couples of metal, it
will be capable not only of emitting signs of electricity by
Cavallo&rsquo;s electrometer, assisted by a condenser, beyond 10&deg; or 15&deg;,
and of charging this condenser by mere contact so as to make it emit
a spark, etc., but of giving to the fingers with which its
extremities (the bottom and top of the column) have been touched
several small shocks, more or less frequent, according as the
touching has been repeated. Each of these shocks has a perfect
resemblance to that slight shock experienced from a Leyden flask
weakly charged, or a battery still more weakly charged, or a torpedo
in an exceedingly languishing state, which imitates still better the
effects of my apparatus by the series of repeated shocks which it
can continually communicate.
[4]

The &ldquo;effects&rdquo; provided by Volta&rsquo;s pile and crown-of-cups are therefore
electroscope deflection, sparks, and shocks. Later in the letter, he
describes the stimulation of sight, taste, and hearing as noted earlier,
but nowhere does he mention chemical phenomena of any kind, or the
heating of a wire joining the terminals of either device. Hence, except
for the additional physiological responses, he adds nothing to the
catalog of observations on which instruments might be based. His
familiarity with the moods of the torpedo (electric eel) seems to be
intimate.

The reading of Volta&rsquo;s letter to the Royal Society on June 26, 1800, its
publication in the Society&rsquo;s Philosophical Transactions (in French)
immediately thereafter, and its publication in English in the
Philosophical Magazine for September 1800,
[5] gave scientists
throughout Europe an easily constructed and continuously operating
electric generator with which innumerable new physical, chemical, and
physiological experiments could be made. Editor-engineer William
Nicholson read Volta&rsquo;s letter before its publication and, by the end of
April, he and surgeon Anthony Carlisle had built a voltaic pile. Applying
[125]
a drop of water to improve the &ldquo;connection&rdquo; of a wire lying on
a metal plate, they happened to notice gas bubbles forming on the wire,
and pursued the observation to the point of identifying the electrical
decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen.

Within two or three years innumerable electrochemical reactions had been
described, some of which, one might think, could have served as
operating principles for electrical instruments. Although the phenomena
of gas formation and metal deposition were in fact widely used as crude
indicators of the polarity and relative strength of voltaic piles and
chemical cells during the period 1800-1820 (and the gas bubbles were
made the basis of a telegraph receiver by S. T. Soemmering), the
quantitative laws of electrolysis were not worked out by Faraday until
after 1830, and not until 1834 was he satisfied that the electrolytic
decomposition of water was sufficiently well understood to be made the
basis for a useful measuring instrument. Describing his
water-electrolysis device in that year, he wrote:

The instrument offers the only actual measurer [italics his] of
voltaic electricity which we at present possess. For without being
at all affected by variations in time or intensity, or alterations
in the current itself, of any kind, or from any cause, or even of
intermissions of actions, it takes note with accuracy of the
quantity of electricity which has passed through it, and reveals
that quantity by inspection; I have therefore named it a
VOLTAELECTROMETER.
[6]

In passing, Faraday commented that the efforts by Gay-Lussac and Thenard
to use chemical decomposition as a &ldquo;measure of the electricity of the
voltaic pile&rdquo; in 1811 had been premature because the &ldquo;principles and
precautions&rdquo; involved were not then known. He also noted that the
details of metal deposition in electrolysis were still not
sufficiently understood to permit its use in an instrument.
[7]

The heating of the wires in electric circuits must have been observed so
early and so often with both electrostatic and voltaic apparatus, that
no one has bothered to claim or trace priorities for this &ldquo;effect.&rdquo; The
production of incandescence, however, and the even more dramatic
combustion or &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; of metal-foil strips and fine wires has a good
deal of recorded history. Among the first to burn leaf metal with a
voltaic pile was J. B. Trommsdorff of Erfurt who noted in 1801 the
distinctly different colors of the flames produced by the various common
metals. In the succeeding few years, Humphry Davy at the Royal
Institution frequently, in his public lectures, showed wires glowing
from electric current.

Early electrical instrumentation based on the heating effect took an
unusual form. Shortly after 1800, W. H. Wollaston, an English M.D.,
learned a method for producing malleable platinum. He kept the process
secret, and for several years enjoyed an extremely profitable monopoly
in the sale of platinum crucibles, wire, and other objects. About 1810,
he invented a technique for producing platinum wire as fine as a few
millionths of an inch in diameter, that has since been known as
&ldquo;Wollaston wire.&rdquo; For several years preceding 1820, no other instrument
could compare the &ldquo;strengths&rdquo; of two voltaic cells better than the test
of the respective maximum lengths of this wire that they could heat to
fusion. One can sympathize with Cumming&rsquo;s comment in 1821 about &ldquo;the
difficulty in soldering wires that are barely
visible.&rdquo;
[8]



Electrical Instrumentation, 1800-1820


The 20 years following the announcement of the voltaic-pile invention
were years of intense experimental activity with this device. Many new
chemical elements were discovered, beginnings were made on the
electrochemical series of the elements, the electric arc and
incandescent platinum wires suggested the possibilities of electric
lighting, and various electrochemical observations gave promise of other
practical applications such as metal-refining, electroplating, and
quantity production of certain gases. Investigators were keenly aware
that all of the available means for measuring and comparing the
electrical aspects of their experiments (however vaguely these
&ldquo;electrical aspects&rdquo; may have been conceived), were slow, awkward,
imprecise, and unreliable.

The atmosphere was such that prominent scientists everywhere were ready
to pounce immediately on any reported discovery of a new electrical
&ldquo;effect,&rdquo; to explore its potentialities for instrumental purposes. Into
this receptive environment came H. C. Oersted&rsquo;s
[126]
announcement of the
magnetic effects of a voltaic circuit, on July 21, 1820.
[9]




Figure 2.&mdash;&ldquo;Galvanometer&rdquo;
was the name given by Bischof
to this goldleaf electrostatic instrument in 1802, 18 years before
Amp&egrave;re coupled the word with the use of Oersted&rsquo;s electromagnetic
experiment as an indicating device.


Oersted&rsquo;s Discovery

Many writers have expressed surprise that with all the use made of
voltaic cells after 1800, including the enormous cells that produced
the electric arc and vaporized wires, no one for 20 years happened to
see a deflection of any of the inevitable nearby compass needles, which
were a basic component of the scientific apparatus kept by any
experimenter at this time. Yet so it happened. The surprise is still
greater when one realizes that many of the contemporary natural
philosophers were firmly persuaded, even in the absence of positive
evidence, that there must be a connection between electricity and
magnetism. Oersted himself held this latter opinion, and had been
seeking electromagnetic relationships more or less deliberately for
several years before he made his decisive observations.

His familiarity with the subject was such that he fully appreciated the
immense importance of his discovery. This accounts for his employing a
rather uncommon method of publication. Instead of submitting a letter to
a scientific society or a report to the editor of a journal, he had
privately printed a four-page pamphlet describing his results. This, he
forwarded simultaneously to the learned societies and outstanding
scientists all over Europe. Written in Latin, the paper was published in
various journals in English, French, German, Italian and Danish during
the next few weeks.[10]

In summary, he reported that a compass needle experienced deviations
when placed near a wire connecting the terminals of a voltaic battery.
He described fully how the direction and magnitude of the needle
deflections varied with the relative position of the wire, and the
polarity of the battery, and stated &ldquo;From the preceding facts, we may
likewise collect that this conflict performs circles&#8230;.&rdquo; Oersted&rsquo;s
comment that the voltaic apparatus used should &ldquo;be strong enough to heat
a metallic wire red hot&rdquo; does not excuse the 20-year delay of the
discovery.



Beginnings of Electromagnetic Instrumentation

The mere locating of a compass needle above or below a suitably oriented
portion of a voltaic circuit created an electrical instrument, the
moment Oersted&rsquo;s &ldquo;effect&rdquo; became known, and it was to this basic
[127]
juxtaposition that Amp&egrave;re quickly gave the name of
galvanometer.
[11] It
cannot be said that the scientists of the day agreed that this
instrument detected or measured &ldquo;electric current,&rdquo; however. Volta
himself had referred to the &ldquo;current&rdquo; in his original circuits, and
Amp&egrave;re used the word freely and confidently in his electrodynamic
researches of 1820-1822, but Oersted did not use it first and many of
the German physicists who followed up his work avoided it for several
years. As late as 1832, Faraday could make only the rather noncommittal
statement: &ldquo;By current I mean anything progressive, whether it be a
fluid of electricity or vibrations or generally progressive
forces.&rdquo;
[12]

Nevertheless, whatever the words or concepts they used, experimenters
agreed that Oersted&rsquo;s apparatus provided a method of monitoring the
&ldquo;strength&rdquo; of a voltaic circuit and a means of comparing, for example,
one voltaic battery or circuit with another.

It was perfectly clear, from Oersted&rsquo;s pamphlet, that if a compass
needle was deflected clockwise when the wire of a particular voltaic
circuit lay above it in the magnetic meridian, the same needle would
also be deflected clockwise if the wire was turned end-for-end and
placed below the compass needle, without changing the rest of the
circuit. Anyone perceiving this fact might deduce, as a matter of logic,
that if the wire of the circuit was first passed above the needle, in
the magnetic meridian, then folded and returned in a parallel path below
the needle, the deflecting effect on the needle would be repeated, and a
more sensitive indicator would result, assuming that any additional wire
introduced has not affected the &ldquo;circuit&rdquo; excessively.

Since 1821, historical accounts of the origins of electromagnetism seem
to have limited their credit assignments for the conception and
observation of this electromagnetic &ldquo;doubling&rdquo; effect
(or &ldquo;multiplying&rdquo;
effect, if the folding is repeated) to three persons. Almost without
exception, however, these accounts have given no specific information as
to precisely what each of these three accomplished, what physical form
their respective creations took, what experiments they performed, and
what functional understanding they apparently had of the situation. The
usual statement is simply that a compass needle was placed in a coil of
wire.
[13] The main purpose
of the present review is to recount some of
these details.

The following are the three candidates whose names are variously
associated with the &ldquo;invention&rdquo; of the first constructed electromagnetic
instrument, or &ldquo;multiplier,&rdquo; or primitive galvanometer.

Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger (1779-1857)
in 1820 had already been
editor for several years of the Journal f&uuml;r Chemie und Physik, and was
professor of chemistry at the University of Halle.

Johann Christian Poggendorf (1796-1877) in
1820 had only recently
entered the University of Berlin as a student following several years as
an apothecary&rsquo;s apprentice and a brief period as an apothecary. Four
years later, he succeeded Gilbert as editor of the influential Annalen
der Physik, a position he held for more than 50 years.

James Cumming (1771-1861) in 1820 was professor
of chemistry at Cambridge University.



Chronology and Priority

The earliest established date in the &ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; record is September
16, 1820, when Schweigger read his first paper to the Natural Philosophy
Society of Halle. There seems to be no reason to doubt that this report
justifies the frequently used label &ldquo;Schweigger&rsquo;s multiplier.&rdquo;

In an exuberant support of Schweigger&rsquo;s position,
Speter
[14] with no
mention of Cumming and no hint of &ldquo;invention&rdquo; details, shows that
Poggendorf in 1821 admitted Schweigger&rsquo;s priority, but suffered some
lapse of memory 40 years later when writing sections of his biographical
dictionary, leaving a distinct
[128]
suggestion that the invention was his.
Further confusion for later generations resulted from some ambiguous
entries in the Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie of 1888. The name
&ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; seems not to have originated with Schweigger himself.
Speter credits it to Meineke as &ldquo;working&rdquo; editor of Schweigger&rsquo;s
Journal, but Seebeck seems to have used it much
earlier.
[15]

Conceding priority of conception to Schweigger (Cumming has not been a
real competitor on this point) does not alter the fact that all three
seem to have reached their results independently of one another, that
the first work of each on this subject was published within a period of
five months, that there were significant differences in their
conceptions of the uses and the optimum design of their devices and that
between them they provided an adequate foundation for the subsequent
development of the galvanometer to become the primary
electrical-measuring instrument.

In the matter of publication, Schweigger, as editor of what was
popularly called Schweigger&rsquo;s Journal, had an obvious advantage, and
presented his experiments beginnings on page 1 of the first volume of
his Journal for 1821, published January 1 of that
year.
[16] Oersted&rsquo;s
paper had appeared two volumes previously. He began by referring to
Oersted&rsquo;s discovery as &ldquo;the most interesting to be presented in a
thousand years of the history of magnetism.&rdquo; He was, in fact, so
impressed with the epochal nature of Oersted&rsquo;s achievement that he
commemorated it by giving his Journal a second title so that &ldquo;volume
one&rdquo; of the new title could begin in the year after Oersted&rsquo;s
publication.

Poggendorf, as a relatively junior student, had no such easy access to
publicity, but he had a staunch admirer in one of his professors, Paul
Erman at the University of Berlin. Erman added a seven-page postscript
on Poggendorf&rsquo;s invention to his book Outline of the Physical Aspects
of the Electro-chemical Magnetism Discovered by Professor Oersted,
published before April 1821,
[17] with an introductory paragraph:

Herr Poggendorf, who is one of the most excellent ornaments of the
lecture room and laboratory of the University here, carried out a
very coherent and well-conceived investigation of electro-chemical
magnetism, leading step-by-step to a method of amplifying this
activity-phenomenon by means of itself.

The postscript begins by referring to the &ldquo;condenser [Kondensator]
just brought to my attention by Herr Poggendorf&rdquo; and explains that he
cannot release his treatise &ldquo;without preliminary announcement of this
subject of the highest importance.&rdquo; (It can be inferred from the text
that the name &ldquo;condenser&rdquo; was chosen because of the device&rsquo;s enhancing
of magnetic measurements analogously to the enhancing of electric
measurements by Volta&rsquo;s electrostatic &ldquo;condenser.&rdquo;)

Immediately on reading the book, Schweigger published extracts, mainly
of the postscript, with indignant comments on Erman&rsquo;s remissness (or
worse) in having failed to mention Schweigger&rsquo;s prior
work.
[18]

However, Erman was not alone in his unawareness, if it was that, of
Schweigger&rsquo;s discovery.

Rival editor Gilbert of the Annalen der Physik reviewed Erman at much
greater length than Schweigger, reprinting most of the postscript with
evident enthusiasm, and stating in his preamble that the invention is
attributed to &ldquo;a young physicist studying here in Berlin, Herr
Poggendorf.&rdquo;
[19]
Only in a footnote is the reader directed to another
footnote in the next article in the volume, where Gilbert finally states
that he &ldquo;cannot leave unmentioned the fact that this amplifying
apparatus seems to be due to Herr Professor Schweigger.&rdquo; He then quotes
rather fully from Schweigger&rsquo;s first two
papers.[16] Oersted in 1823
explained the situation thus: &ldquo;The work of M. Poggendorf, having been
mentioned in a book
[129]
on electromagnetism by the celebrated M. Erman
published very shortly after its discovery, became known to many
scientists before that of M. Schweigger. This is the reason for the same
apparatus carrying different names.&rdquo;
[20]

The same confusion is well illustrated by the paper to which Gilbert
attached his confessional footnote mentioned above. Written by Professor
Raschig of Dresden, on April 3, 1821, the paper is entitled &ldquo;Experiments
with the Electro-magnetic Multiplier,&rdquo; but the device, throughout the
paper, is repeatedly referred to in the phrase &ldquo;Poggendorf&rsquo;s condenser,
or rather multiplier,&rdquo; an awkward combination that suggests editorial
intervention.
[21]

The work of James Cumming at Cambridge is described in two papers which
he read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1821, which were then
duly published in the Transactions of that Society. The first, &ldquo;On the
Connexion of Galvanism and Magnetism,&rdquo; was read April 2,
1821,
[22] and
the second, &ldquo;On the Application of Magnetism as a Measure of
Electricity,&rdquo; was read a few weeks later on May
21st.
[23]

Though he quotes some unrelated 18th-century experiments by Ritter in
Germany, an 1807 publication of Oersted&rsquo;s, and electromagnetic
experiments with solenoids performed by Arago and Amp&egrave;re in late 1820,
Cumming makes no mention of Schweigger or Poggendorf, and never uses the
word &ldquo;multiplier.&rdquo; It, therefore, seems probable that his work was done
without knowledge of the German publications or inventions.



Original Electromagnetic Multipliers

Of the three sets of instruments made, respectively, by Schweigger,
Poggendorf and Cumming, those of Schweigger are the most elementary, and
the least realistic from a practical point of view. He makes little
effort to investigate the effect of any design parameters, but presents
some odd conductor configurations that involve unimportant variations of
the basic principle. The following extracts from his first three
papers[13]
contain the major references to his conception, construction,
and use of his multiplier.


PAPER READ IN HALLE, SEPTEMBER 16, 1820


That a powerful voltaic pile is required for these experiments (of
Oersted) I have confirmed in my physics lectures, using an electric
pile that was so strong it would easily produce potassium metal the
second and third day after it was built. However, I soon saw that
the electromagnetic effect was related, not to the pile, but to the
simple circuit, and I was thereby led to perform the experiment with
much greater sensitivity. To amplify these electromagnetic phenomena
of the simple circuit it seemed to me necessary to adopt a different
arrangement from that initiated by Volta, in order that the
electrical phenomena of his simple circuit might be raised to a
higher degree.

Since a reversal of the effect occurs according to whether the
connecting-wire lies over or under the needle, and likewise
according to whether the wire leads from the positive or negative
pole, thence I say it is an easy inference that a doubling of the
effect is attainable, which is verified in practice.

I present to the Society the simple &ldquo;doubling apparatus&rdquo;
[Verdoppelungs-Apparat], where the compass is placed between two
wires passing around it. A multiplication of the effect is easily
obtained when the wire is not just once but many times wound around.
A single turn suffices, however, to demonstrate Oersted&rsquo;s
experiments, using small strips of zinc and copper dipped in
ammonium-chloride solution.



Amid innumerable, rambling theorizations (such as, that &ldquo;hydrogenation
affects magnetism as oxidation affects galvanism,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sulphur,
phosphorous and carbon are especially significant in magnetism, since
iron in combination with any of these inflammable materials becomes a
magnet-material&rdquo;), Schweigger announces that he looked for the reactive
force of the needle on the connecting wire in the simple Oersted
experiment, and that he used his &ldquo;amplifying apparatus&rdquo; to look for
magnetic effects from an electrostatic machine, but without success in
both cases. He suggests that he will continue with many more
electromagnetic experiments because &ldquo;with the use of the
doubling-apparatus, the needle, instead of needing for excitation a cell
capable of generating sparks, approaches more closely the sensitivity of
a twitching nerve.&rdquo; However, &ldquo;additional special experiments are
required to find to what limits the amplification can be increased by
the method I have created in the construction of this
doubling-apparatus, using multiple turns of wire.&rdquo;

[130]




Figure 3.&mdash;This wire &ldquo;bow-pattern&rdquo; was the first
illustration Schweigger gave of his &ldquo;doubling apparatus,&rdquo; though he had
presented a verbal description of a single-coil arrangement somewhat
earlier. The purpose of the bow pattern was to show that compass needles
at the centers of the two loops deflected in opposite directions. (From
Journal f&uuml;r Chemie und Physik.)


PAPER READ IN HALLE, NOVEMBER 4, 1820

[The first half of this paper describes successful observations of the
reaction-force of a magnetic needle on the connecting wire of a voltaic
circuit, achieved by pivoting the connecting wire in the form of brass
needles above and below the compass needle. Though the multiplier
configuration of needle and wire is in fact present here, Schweigger
does not mention it, evidently regarding this as a separate project. He
continues.]

In my lecture of September 16th, I showed that Oersted&rsquo;s results
depend, not on the voltaic cell, but only on the connecting circuit.
The principle I have used for amplification of the effects, for the
construction of an electromagnetic battery as it were, was the
winding of wire around the compass, and I now present to the Society
a bow-pattern of multiple-wound, wax-insulated wire, Figure 3.
[There were no illustrations with Schweigger&rsquo;s first paper.] While
a single wire, using the weak electric circuit here, deflects the
magnetic needle only 30&deg; or 40&deg;, if the compass is placed in one of
the openings of this pattern, the needle is deflected 90&deg; to the
east, or in the other opening 90&deg; to the west, using the same weak
electric circuit&#8230;.

The &ldquo;bow-pattern&rdquo; device has novelty interest only, adding nothing to
the elucidation of the multiplier phenomenon. The same is true of
Schweigger&rsquo;s next proposal, shown in figure 4. &ldquo;&#8230; I will now add
another apparatus, which is just an extension of the previous one,
whereby the needle can take up any angle from 0&deg; to 180&deg;.&rdquo; A short
length of circular glass tubing, of inside diameter large enough to
contain a compass needle, stands with its axis vertical and has single
or multiple loops of wire wound on it in vertical diametral planes. In
the illustration, successive plane coils are inclined at 30&deg; to one
another. &ldquo;&#8230; the electric current flows through the whole wire, and the
needle moves under all of these currents, and coming always into another
loop can take any desired angle.&rdquo;

With much further theorizing about &ldquo;the correlation of magnetism with
the cohesion of bodies,&rdquo; Schweigger states again his evaluation of his
discovery: &ldquo;Oersted succeeded in electromagnetic research by using a
spark-producing cell, which could make a wire glow. My amplifying
electromagnetic device needs only a weak circuit of copper, zinc, and
ammonium chloride solution.&rdquo;
[24]

[131]




Figure 4.&mdash;Schweigger made this peculiar construction of
wire coils, wound endwise on a short vertical section of glass tubing
with a compass needle inside, merely to startle his Halle audience with
the fact that the compass needle could rest in any of several stable
positions. (From Journal f&uuml;r Chemie und Physik.)





Figure 5.&mdash;Schweigger&rsquo;s suggestion of one possible design
for an amplifying electromagnetic indicator. The components are wooden
rods and insulated wire. Position b referred to in the text is at the
bottom of the diagram between the letters a and c. (From Journal f&uuml;r
Chemie und Physik.)


&ldquo;FURTHER WORDS ABOUT THE NEW MAGNETIC PHENOMENA&rdquo;

[This was presumably written between November 4, 1820, and the January
1, 1821, publication date of his Journal.]


These wonderful new electrical effects
[25] are most easily rendered
perceptible with the help of the previously described wire loops. To
focus attention on just one of the windings of Figure 3, we sketch a
new drawing, Figure 5&#8230;. Since it is of major importance that these
loops be made of silk-covered wire lying evenly on one another, it
is convenient to wind the loops on two small slotted sticks of wood,
although it is also possible to hold the wires together with wax or
shellac, or to tie them together in an orderly manner with silk
thread&#8230;.

In Figure 5, Aa and Cc represent little slotted rods of wood on
which the silk-covered wire is wound. Only three windings are shown
in the figure, but I generally adopt three times that many. Now t is
connected with the copper and d with the zinc, and the compass B set
between the rods Aa and Cc with the coil perpendicular to the
magnetic meridian and the terminals d, t at the east.

The instant Z and K are dipped in the ammonium chloride solution,
the needle turns around and stays with the north pole point
south&#8230;.

If now the compass is taken out of the coil and put in position b,
all effects are reversed, and are considerably weaker, for obvious
reasons&#8230;.

[132]

It is of the same significance whether we bring the compass from B
to b in Figure 5, or from mesh 1 to mesh 2 in Figure 3, only that in
the latter case, because the compass is enclosed by the two sides, a
stronger effect results&#8230;.

If now the coil is rotated &#8230; so that the face previously north now
faces south, then on connecting the electric circuit there is
absolutely no trace of effect on the needle, assuming that the
terminal wires are not reversed&#8230;.

It seems unnecessary to note that our magnetic coil can be placed in
the direction of the magnetic meridian or at any arbitrary angle
with it&#8230;.


Following several pages of further talk about the relation of &ldquo;cohesion
to magnetism&rdquo; and about &ldquo;unipolar and bipolar conductors,&rdquo; the only
additional item of interest is the observation that discharges of a
Leyden jar (Kleistichen Flasche) strong enough to burn strips of leaf
gold and to magnetize an iron rod in a coil, produced no compass-needle
deflections, even with the help of the &ldquo;amplifying apparatus.&rdquo;

Schweigger, therefore, described the basic multiplier idea clearly
enough in his first paper, but offered no sketch of the simplest
construction until the third paper. In the second paper, meanwhile, he
had illustrated two peculiar designs involving the principle in less
elementary ways.

His indifference to whether the wire loops lie in the magnetic
meridian (fig.&nbsp;3) or perpendicular to it
(fig.&nbsp;5) or &ldquo;at any other
arbitrary angle to it,&rdquo; reveals a poor appreciation of the
measuring-instrument potentialities. His conception seems to be
primarily that of a detector.

Poggendorf&rsquo;s invention, as first reported by Erman and presented to a
wider audience by Gilbert
[26] was described as consisting of typically
40 to 50 turns of 1/10-line diameter, silk-covered copper wire tied
tightly together, with the whole pressed laterally to form an elliptical
opening in which a pivoted compass needle could move freely while
maintaining clearance of about 2 lines from the wire at all points.
[27]

&ldquo;This magnetic condenser can be a great boon to electro-chemistry,&rdquo; said
Erman, for &ldquo;it avoids all the difficulties of electric condensers.&rdquo; He
noted that, using the condenser, Poggendorf had already established the
electric series for a great number of bodies, discovered various
anomalies about conductivities, and found a way of detecting dissymmetry
of the poles of a compass needle. On the other hand, even with the
condenser, no magnetic effects have so far been obtainable from a strong
tourmaline, or from a 12,000-pair, Zamboni dry cell.

Poggendorf&rsquo;s own account of his work finally appeared as a very long
article in the journal known as &ldquo;Oken&rsquo;s Isis.&rdquo;
[28] The editorial
controversies mentioned earlier may have occasioned this use of a
periodical of such minor status in the fields of physics and chemistry.

The source of Poggendorf&rsquo;s vision of the multiplier principle was a
little different from Schweigger&rsquo;s inspiration. Aiming at some detailed
analysis of Oersted&rsquo;s observation, Poggendorf ran the connecting wire of
his cell-circuit along a vertical line to just above or below the
pivot-point of the compass needle, then, after a right-angle bend,
horizontally above or below one of the poles of the needle. As he
studied the deflections produced for all four possible positions of such
a wire, with both cell polarities, he came to realize that if a
rectangular wire loop in a vertical plane enclosed a compass needle, all
parts of the horizontal sides of the loop would produce additive
deflections. By a separate experiment, he showed that the vertical sides
of the loop would also increase the deflections. He saw at the same time
that the effect of additional turns would be cumulative.


The multiple surrounding of the needle by a silk-covered wire, in a
plane perpendicular to the long axis of the needle, affords the
physicist a very simple and sensitive means of detecting the
slightest trace of galvanism, or of magnetism produced by it, so
that I have given the name of magnetic condenser to this
construction, though I attach no special value to this name &#8230;

In analyzing the astonishingly increased power which the condenser
gives to the magnetic effect of a circuit, the first question that
arises is how the effect varies with the number of turns, whether it
increases indefinitely or reaches a maximum beyond which additional
turns have no effect. The answer to this first question is linked to
the solution of another, viz, whether the degrees deflection are a
direct expression of the measure of the magnetic force or not.

To instruct myself on this point I made use of three separate
circuits, each containing an 8-turn condenser, and put these as
close together as possible in the magnetic
[133]
meridian &#8230; with the needle between the windings. Each single circuit &#8230; gave a
deflection of 45&deg; &#8230; When two were connected the deflection was
60&deg;, and when finally all three were put in magnetic operation, the
deflection grew to only 70&deg;. It appears clearly from this that the
angle of deflection is not in a simple ratio with the magnetic force
acting on the needle&#8230;.


Neither Poggendorf nor Schweigger seems to have ruled out, on logical
grounds alone, the possibility of deflections greater than 90&deg;, with the
loop-plane in the magnetic meridian, though Poggendorf does add a vague
note that if the needle deflected too far it would encounter forces of
the opposing sign.

Poggendorf experimented with the size of the circuit wires, finding that
larger wires led to greater deflections. He noted that the size of the
cell plates and the nature of the cell&rsquo;s moist conductors would
certainly have a great effect, but that to investigate these in detail
would take undue time, and he therefore proposed to keep this part of
the apparatus constant, using one pair of zinc and copper plates 3.6
inches in diameter, separated by cloth soaked in ammonium-chloride
solution.

Poggendorf&rsquo;s principal quantitative study of his magnetic condenser used
13 identical coils, each with 100 turns. In order that the turns should
all be at approximately the same distance from the needle, the coils
were wound of the finest brass wire that could be silk-insulated, the
wire diameter being 0.02 lines. On adding coils one at a time across the
cell (i.e., connecting them in parallel), the deflections were as
follows:



  Turns
  100
  200
  300
  400
  500
  600
  700
  800

  62
  63
  64
  65
  651/2
  66
  66
  66
  66



Adding some coils with fewer turns, and connecting various combinations
&ldquo;as a continuum&rdquo; (i.e., in series), the deflections using the same
cell were:



  Turns
  1
  5
  10
  25
  50
  75
  100
  200

Making a few coils from wire with 1/8-line diameter, the deflections,
again using the same cell were:

  50
  100
  Over 100


  Deflectionin degrees
  20-22
  40-45
  45
  65
  65



Since the needle used in these experiments was almost as long as the
inside clearance of the coils, no simple tangent law can be applied, and
it is not possible to discover an equivalent circuit in modern terms.
However, the constancy of the deflections for large numbers of turns in
each case indicates that the cell voltage and resistance were fairly
constant, and a rough estimate suggests that the cell resistance was
comparable to the resistance of one of the 100-turn coils of fine wire.
Such a value means that cell resistance limited the maximum deflections
for the parallel-connected multipliers, while coil resistance fixed the
limit in the series case.

For all of these reasons, it was impossible that any useful functional
law could be obtained from the data.

Poggendorf concluded only that &ldquo;the amplifying power of the condenser
does not increase without limit, but has a maximum value dependent on
the conditions of plate area and wire size.&rdquo; He added two other
significant comments derived from various observations, that the basic
Oersted phenomenon is independent of the earth&rsquo;s magnetism, and that the
phenomenon is localized, i.e., is not affected by distant parts of the
circuit.

Only a small fraction of Poggendorf&rsquo;s paper is devoted to elucidating
the properties of the condenser. A similar amount is concerned with
refuting various proposals, such as those of Berzelius and Erman, about
distributions of magnetic polarity in a conducting wire to account for
Oersted&rsquo;s results. More than half of the paper describes results
obtained by using the condenser to compare conductivities and cell
polarities under conditions where no effect had previously been
detectable. Notable is the observation of needle deflections in circuits
whose connecting wires are interrupted by pieces of graphite, manganese
dioxide, various sulphur compounds, etc., materials which had previously
been considered as insulators in galvanic circuits. Poggendorf gives
these the name of &ldquo;semi-conductor&rdquo; (halb-Leiter).

[134]




Figure 6.&mdash;Electromagnetic instruments of James Cumming,
used at Cambridge in 1821. One is a single-wire &ldquo;galvanometer,&rdquo;
following Amp&egrave;re&rsquo;s definition. Cumming called the multiple-turn
construction &ldquo;galvanoscopes.&rdquo; He showed how to increase their
sensitivity by partial cancellation of the earth&rsquo;s magnetism at the
location of the compass needle. (From Transactions of the Cambridge
Philosophical Society, vol. 1, 1821.)


Cumming&rsquo;s first mention of the multiplier phenomenon, in his paper of
April 2, 1821,[22]
is quite casual, and describes only a one-turn
construction. He speaks first of single-turn ring of thick, brass wire,
and after noting that the sides of a circuit produce additive effects on
a needle, he comments that a flattened rectangular loop produces nearly
quadruple the effect of a single wire. The paper is primarily a review
of Oersted&rsquo;s work, with references to electromagnetic observations
before Oersted, and accounts of various related but nonmultiplier
experiments that Cumming has made. His second paper, of May 21st,
contains a fine plate (fig.&nbsp;6) illustrating arrangements used in
investigating the subject of the paper&rsquo;s title &ldquo;The Application of
Magnetism as a Measure of Electricity.&rdquo; (Neither Poggendorf nor any of
his commentators ever illustrated his &ldquo;condenser.&rdquo;)

Although this plate is never referred to in the paper itself, a nearby
&ldquo;Description&rdquo; gives a few comments. The two wire patterns shown are
noted as simply &ldquo;forms of spiral for increasing the electromagnetic
intensity.&rdquo; The mounted wire loop, with enclosed compass needle and
terminal mercury cups, is clearly identical in principle with the
devices of Schweigger and Poggendorf, and is called a &ldquo;galvanoscope.&rdquo;
The largest structure illustrated does not involve the multiplying
effect. It is called a &ldquo;galvanometer,&rdquo; consistent with Amp&egrave;re&rsquo;s
definition of that word. To use it, two leads of a voltaic circuit are
inserted into the mercury cups AC and BD, and the board EFGH carrying
the cups is moved vertically until some &ldquo;standard&rdquo; deflection is
obtained on the compass needle below. The relative &ldquo;strength&rdquo; of the
circuit is then given by the calibrated position of the sliding section.
Uncertainties are undoubtedly introduced
[135]
by the arbitrary positions of
the connecting wires from the test circuit to the mercury cups, but
Cumming drew some interesting conclusions from various measurements he
made.

Observing needle deflections for various positions of the wire A-B, with
a &ldquo;constant&rdquo; voltaic circuit, he found that &ldquo;the tangent of the
deviation varies inversely as the distance of the connecting wire from
the magnetic needle.&rdquo; Here is a combination of the deflection law for a
needle in a transverse horizontal field and the magnetic-force law for a
long, straight wire. The latter had been determined experimentally by
Biot and Savart, in November 1820, by timing the oscillations of a
suspended magnet.
[29]




Figure 7.&mdash;&ldquo;Schweigger
multiplier&rdquo; used by Oersted in
1823. A thin magnetic needle is held in a light, paper sling at F,
suspended by a fine, vertical fiber. (From Annales de Chimie et de
Physique.)


Cumming considers his straight-wire calibrated &ldquo;galvanometer&rdquo; to be a
device for &ldquo;measuring&rdquo; galvanic electricity; on the other hand, his
multiple-loop &ldquo;galvanoscopes&rdquo; are for &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; galvanic
electricity. With the multiplier instrument, he found galvanic effects
(i.e., needle deflections) using copper and zinc electrodes with several
acids not previously known to create galvanic action. A
potassium-mercury amalgam electrode created a powerful cell with zinc as
the positive electrode, establishing both the metallic nature of
potassium and the fact that it is the most negative of all metals.

In a third paper, presented April 28, 1823,
[30] Cumming reports use of
the galvanoscope in experiments on the thermoelectric phenomena recently
discovered by Seebeck. His note that &ldquo;for the more minute effects a
compass was employed in the galvanoscope, having its terrestrial
magnetism neutralized &#8230;&rdquo; seems to be the earliest mention of this
version of the astatic principle, a technique whose dramatic effects
were especially valuable in low-resistance thermoelectric circuits,
where the extra resistance of additional multiplier turns largely
offsets their magnetic contribution. In detail, &ldquo;the needle is
neutralized by placing a powerful magnet North and South on a line with
its center; and another, which is much weaker, East and West at some
distance above it: by means of the first the needle is placed nearly at
right angles to the meridian, and the adjustment is completed by the
second.&rdquo;

On varying the length of the connecting wire of the circuit, Cumming
found the deflections of the multiplier needle to be in a nearly
reciprocal relation. He speaks of the &ldquo;conducting power of the wire,&rdquo;
and seems not far from visualizing Ohm&rsquo;s law, of which no published form
appeared until 1826. Ohm&rsquo;s own experiments were made with very similar
apparatus.


Conclusions

An effort has been made to show that electrical experimenters prior to
Oersted&rsquo;s discovery in 1820 were in desperate need of some electrical
instrument for galvanic or voltaic circuits that would combine
sensitivity, simplicity, reliability, and quick response.
[136]
The nearly simultaneous creation by Schweigger, Poggendorf and Cumming of an
arrangement consisting of a coil of wire and a compass needle provided
the first primitive version of a device to fill that need.




Figure 8.&mdash;Completely useless arrangement of vertical
coil and horizontal, unmagnetized needle, presented in the Edinburgh
Philosophical Journal of 1821 as &ldquo;Poggendorf&rsquo;s Galvano-Magnetic
Condenser.&rdquo; Almost every aspect of Poggendorf&rsquo;s instrument has been
incorrectly represented.


It appears that Schweigger is clearly entitled to credit for absolute
priority in the discovery, but the original sources suggest that both
his understanding of the device and the subsequent researches he
performed with it were markedly inferior to those of the other
independent discoverers. In using the generic label, &ldquo;Schweigger&rsquo;s
Multiplier,&rdquo; there have been historical examples of attributing to
Schweigger considerably more sophistication than is justified. Figure 7
shows an instrument designed by Oersted in 1823,
[20] which he says
&ldquo;differs in only minor particulars from that of M. Schweigger.&rdquo; On
comparing figure 7 with figures
3, 4, or
5, the remark seems overly
generous.

The history of the multiplier instruments has had its fair share of
erroneous reports and misleading clues. A fine example is the
illustration of figure 8, taken from what is often quoted as the first
report in English on Poggendorf&rsquo;s &ldquo;Galvano-Magnetic
Condenser.&rdquo;
[31] The
sketch is the editor&rsquo;s interpretation of a verbal description given him
by a visiting Danish chemist who, in turn, had received the information
in a letter from Oersted. It incorporates, faithful to the description,
a &ldquo;spiral wire &#8230; established vertically,&rdquo; with a needle &ldquo;in the axis
of the spiral,&rdquo; yet by misunderstanding of the axial relations and of
the ratio of length to diameter for the coil, a completely meaningless
arrangement has resulted. The confusion is compounded by the specifying
of an unmagnetized needle.

Schweigger and Poggendorf, through their editorial positions, were among
the best known of all European scientists for several decades. On one
basis or another their reputations are firmly established. Comparison of
the accounts of the early &ldquo;multipliers,&rdquo; however, suggests that the
Reverend James Cumming, professor of chemistry at the University of
Cambridge, was a very perceptive philosopher. This was well understood
by G. T. Bettany who wrote in the Dictionary of National Biography
that Cumming&rsquo;s early papers &ldquo;though extremely unpretentious,&rdquo; were
&ldquo;landmarks in electromagnetism and thermoelectricity,&rdquo; and concluded
that: &ldquo;Had he been more ambitious and of less uncertain health, his
clearness and grasp and his great aptitude for research might have
carried him into the front rank of discoverers.&rdquo;

outside the tank, also with the fish stationary.

electricity, has not been established. The wiring is regarded more as
something incidental, used to &ldquo;close&rdquo; the cell, the cell being
considered essentially the whole of the apparatus. This view underlies
the many attempts to correlate the Oersted phenomena with cell materials
and design, and with the use of such terms as &ldquo;chemical

FULTON&rsquo;S &ldquo;STEAM BATTERY&rdquo;:
BLOCKSHIP and CATAMARAN


Robert Fulton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Steam Battery,&rdquo; a catamaran-type
blockship, was built
during the War of 1812. Until recently, not enough material has been
available to permit a reasonably accurate reconstruction of what is
generally acknowledged to be the first steam man-of-war.

With the discovery, in the Danish Royal Archives at Copenhagen, of
plans of this vessel, it is now possible to prepare a reconstruction and
to build a model.

This article summarizes the history of the vessel, describes the plans
and the reconstruction, and also evaluates its design with particular
attention to the double-hull construction.

The Author: Howard I. Chapelle is curator of
transportation in the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s Museum of History and
Technology.


The identity
of the first steam man-of-war has been known for many
years, and a great deal has been written and published on the history of
this American vessel. Until recently, the only available drawing of the
ship has been a patent drawing made for Robert Fulton. This does not
comply with contemporary descriptions of the steamer and the drawing or
plan is out of proportion with the known dimensions. The lack of plans
has heretofore made it impossible to illustrate the vessel with any
degree of precision, or to build a scale model.

The discovery in 1960 of some of the plans of this historic ship in the
Danish Royal Archives at Copenhagen now makes possible a reasonably
accurate reconstruction of the vessel and also clarifies some of the
incomplete and often confusing descriptions by contemporary writers.

Of the numerous published accounts of the ship that are available, the
most complete is David B. Tyler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fulton&rsquo;s Steam
Frigate.&rdquo;
[1] A
contemporary description of the vessel by the British Minister to
Washington, 1820-23, Stratford Canning, was published by Arthur J.
May.
[2] In Naval and Mail
Steamers of the United States, by Charles B.
Stuart,
[3] and The Steam Navy of
the United States, by Frank M.
Bennett,
[4] the history of the ship
and some descriptive facts are
given. Stuart, in an appendix, gives in full the report of the
Supervisory Committee (set up to administer the building contract).
Tyler and Stuart, and the Committee Report are the principal sources
from which the following summary of the ship&rsquo;s history is drawn.

Figure 2.&mdash;&ldquo;Demologos,&rdquo;
a wood engraving based on the
sketch which Robert Fulton showed to President Madison in 1813. This
wood engraving appears as plate 1 in Charles B. Stuart&rsquo;s Naval and Mail
Steamers of the United States, and illustrates the section on Naval
Steamers, from which the account &ldquo;The Demologos; or, Fulton the First,&rdquo;
is here reproduced (pp. 167-171). Stuart obtained the sketch, assumed to
have been made for Fulton&rsquo;s patent on the design of the Steam Battery,
from the files of the U.S. Navy Department.



On December 24, 1813, Robert Fulton invited a group of
friends&mdash;prominent merchants, professional men and naval officers&mdash;to
his home in New York City and there presented a proposal for a project
of great local interest. At that time the War of 1812 was in its second
year and the economic effect of the British naval blockade was being
felt severely. The blockade cut off seaborne trade and posed a constant
threat of attack upon New York and other important ports, particularly
Baltimore. To defend the ports, it had been proposed to build mobile
floating batteries or heavily built and armed hulks with small sailing
rigs, but the high cost of these and their doubtful value in helping to
break the blockade, compared to the value and action of a very heavy,
large frigate, or a 74-gun ship, caused authorities to hesitate to
proceed with the construction of any blockships or floating batteries.

Fulton&rsquo;s proposal concerned a floating battery propelled by steam
power. He believed that steam propulsion not only would give it
effective maneuverability with no loss of gunpower, but also would allow
a successful attack upon the Royal Navy blockading ships during periods
of protracted calm, when sailing men-of-war were nearly helpless. The
blockaders then could be attacked and picked off, one by one, by the
heavily armed steamboat.

Among those present at the meeting was Major General Henry Dearborn, a
leading citizen and soldier who was later to become noted in American
political history. The first step taken during this meeting was the
founding of the Coast and Harbor Defense Company with Dearborn as
president, Fulton as engineer, and Thomas Morris as secretary. Next, a
committee was established to raise funds from Federal, State, and New
York City governments as well as from individual contributors to build
the battery. The members of this committee consisted of General
Dearborn, Commodore Stephen Decatur, U.S.N.; General Morgan Lewis;
Commodore Jacob Jones; U.S.N.; Noah Brown, shipbuilder; Samuel L.
Mitchill; Henry Rutgers; and Thomas Morris.

The committee proved cumbersome and was reduced to General Lewis, Issac
Bronson, Henry Rutgers, Nathan Sanford, Thomas Morris, Oliver Wolcott,
and John Jacob Astor. Known as the Coast Defense Society and with the
name of Pyremon given the ship in prospectus, they attempted,
unsuccessfully, to raise funds privately.

The estimated sums to build a battery 130 feet long, with a 50-foot
beam, capable of a speed of 5 mph, and carrying 24 long guns (18-pdr.),
was $110,000. Fulton, still the chief engineer, in an effort to interest
the Federal Government, built a model of the proposed vessel and
submitted it to some prominent naval officers&mdash;Commodore Stephen
Decatur, Jacob Jones, James Biddle, Samuel Evans, Oliver Perry, Samuel
Warrington, and Jacob Lewis. All gave their support to the Society in a
written statement and this recommendation proved helpful to the project
in Congress and in the Navy Department. In the process of passing a bill
which went to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee calling for $250,000
for the construction of the floating battery, the sum was raised to
$1,500,000 for the construction of &ldquo;one or more&rdquo; floating batteries and
passed on March 9, 1814.

To supervise the start of construction, the Coast Defense Society
appointed a committee consisting of Dearborn, Wolcott, Morris, Mitchill,
and Rutgers, with Fulton as engineer, and a model and drawing of the
proposed vessel was submitted to the Patent Office. The Secretary of the
Navy, although supporting the project, delayed action until he had
weighed the importance of the batteries in relation to other war needs,
for at this time the naval shipbuilding program on the Great Lakes was
considered of prime importance. He also raised some technical questions
concerning the design of the batteries, which Fulton answered with a
description of the vessel as 138 feet on deck, 120 feet on the keel, 55
feet beam (each hull to have a 20-foot beam and the &ldquo;race&rdquo; between to be
15 feet wide), draft 8 or 9 feet loaded, and the intended speed was to
be 41/2 to 5 mph. The ship was to carry 24 long guns (32-pdr.), the
engine was to be 130 hp, and the total cost, $200,000. In his letters to
the Secretary of the Navy, Fulton stated that Adam and Noah Brown would
build the hull for $69,800 and that he would build
[142]
the engine, machinery
and boilers for $78,000, a total of $147,800. He intended to have the
boilers, valves, fastenings, and air pumps of brass or copper, which
would raise the machinery costs 59 percent above that of stationary
engines and boilers then in use.

On May 23, 1814, the Secretary of the Navy authorized the Coast Defense
Society and its committee to act as Navy agents and to enter into the
contracts required to build a vessel, and to draw on the Navy
storekeepers or Navy Yard commandants for such stores or articles on
hand needed for construction. The contracts were prepared and the
committee now was officially empowered to act for the Society, with
Rutgers, Wolcott, Morris, Dearborn, Mitchill, and Fulton. On June 4,
Dearborn asked the Navy Department for $25,000 advance, for work had
started. On the 6th, he informed the Secretary that he had been ordered
to assume command of the defenses of Boston and that Rutgers had been
appointed chairman of the construction committee in his place.

It is apparent that the Navy Department was pressed for funds, due to
the very extensive shipbuilding programs on Lakes Erie, Ontario, and
Champlain in addition to the seagoing vessels being built in some of the
coastal ports. This was certainly one cause for the Secretary of the
Navy&rsquo;s reluctance to carry out the requirements of the bill passed by
Congress immediately after its signature and, also, this reluctance
caused the supervisory committee much embarrassment in its
administration of the contract.

Another factor which caused difficulty in the administration of the
contract was the position of Adam and Noah Brown. The brothers were
deeply involved in the shipbuilding program on the Lakes, in which they
were associated at times with Henry Eckford. The Browns constructed a
blockhouse, shops, and quarters at Erie; in addition to Perry&rsquo;s two
brigs and five of his schooners, they also built some of the Lake
Ontario vessels and, later, the Saratoga on Lake Champlain. In their
New York yard, whose operation continued throughout the war, they built
some large letter-of-marques: the General Armstrong, Prince de
Neufchatel, Zebra, Paul Jones, and some smaller vessels. They also
cut down the 2-decked, merchant ship China into a single flush-deck
letter-of-marque, renamed Yorktown; and they had a contract to build
the sloop-of-war Peacock. It is remarkable that the Browns could
undertake and complete so much work between 1813 and 1815 and still be
able to build the steam battery in a very short time.

With the contracts in order, the Browns began building. The keels of the
battery were laid June 20, 1814. It is apparent that the Browns prepared
the original hull plans, undoubtedly before the building authority was
obtained. The vessel required only about four months to build; she was
launched October 29, 1814, at 9 a.m. This was an excellent performance,
considering the size of the vessel, the amount of timber required and
handled in her massive construction, and the other work being done by
the builders. During the ship&rsquo;s construction, sightseers were a nuisance
and finally guards had to be obtained. During the building of the steam
battery, work had to be practically stopped on the sloop-of-war
Peacock at one period after she had been partially planked.

There were difficulties in obtaining metalwork for the vessel during her
construction, due to the blockade and the demand for such material for
other shipbuilding at New York. On November 21, 1814, the ship was towed
from the Browns&rsquo; yard on the East River by Fulton&rsquo;s Car of Neptune and
Fulton, each lashed to the sides of the battery, and taken to Fulton&rsquo;s
works on the North River. There Fulton supervised in person the
completion of the vessel and construction of her machinery. Undoubtedly
only a little of his time was required in inspection of the Browns&rsquo; work
on the battery, for the shipbuilders had been closely associated with
Fulton throughout the life of the project and were fully capable as ship
designers. The work on the machinery was another matter, however, for
men capable of working metal were scarce and few workmen could read
plans. Fulton had some of the work done outside of his own plant,
particularly the brass and copper work (mostly by John Youle&rsquo;s foundry).
As a result, Fulton was required to move from plant to plant, keeping
each job under almost constant observation and personally supervising
the workmen. The equipment then available for building a large engine
was inadequate in many ways. The large steam cylinder presented a
problem: it had to be recast several times and some of the other parts
gave trouble, either in casting or in machining and fitting.

[143]

Guns for the battery were another problem. Only 3 long guns (32-pdr.),
were available at the Navy Yard. The Secretary of the Navy promised some
captured guns then at Philadelphia. Because of the blockade, these had
to come overland to New York. The captured guns thus obtained were
probably English,
[144]
part of the cargo of the British ship John of
Lancaster captured by the frigate President early in the war.
Apparently 24 guns were obtained this way; only 2 were obtained from the
Navy Yard. In July the Supervising Committee carried out some
experimental damage studies, in which a 32-pdr. was fired at a target
representing a section of the topsides of the battery. Drawings of the
result were sent to the Secretary of the Navy.

Further problems arose over the delays of the government in making
payments: the banks discounted the Treasury notes, so the Committee
members had to advance $5,000 out of their own pockets. There was fear
that British agents might damage the vessel, and although the project
was undoubtedly known to the British, no evidence of any act of sabotage
was ever found. Captain David Porter was assigned to the command of the
battery in November, and it was upon his request that the vessel was
later rigged with sails.

With the Steam Battery approaching completion, the Secretary of the
Navy became more enthusiastic and the construction of other batteries of
this type was again proposed. Captain Stiles, a Baltimore merchant,
offered to build a steam battery, the hull to cost $50,000; the entire
cost of the vessel, $150,000, was raised in Baltimore and the frames of
a battery erected. Another battery was projected at Philadelphia and the
Secretary of the Navy wanted one or more built at Sackett&rsquo;s Harbor, but
naval officers and Fulton objected. A bill put before Congress to
authorize another half million to build steam batteries passed the first
reading January 9, 1815, went to the House February 22, 1815, but the
end of the war prevented any further action on it.

On February 24, 1815, Fulton died. He had been to Trenton, New Jersey,
to attend a hearing on the steamboat monopoly and, on the way back, the
ferry on North River was caught in the ice. Fulton and his lawyer,
Emmet, had to walk over the ice to get ashore. On the way, Emmet fell
through and Fulton got wet and chilled while helping him. After two or
three days in bed Fulton went to his foundry to inspect the battery&rsquo;s
machinery causing a relapse from which he died. This resulted in some
delay in completing the machinery and stopped work on the Mute, an
80-foot, manually propelled, torpedo boat that Fulton was having built
in the Browns&rsquo; yard.

It was decided to suspend work on the Baltimore battery after an
expenditure of $61,500, but the New York battery was to be completed to
prove the project was practical. The final payment of $50,000 was made
four months after it was requested.

Charles Stoudinger, Fulton&rsquo;s foreman or superintendent, was able to
complete and install the ship&rsquo;s machinery. On June 10, 1815, the vessel
was given a short trial run in the harbor with Stoudinger and the Navy
inspector, Captain Smith, on board. This trial revealed the need of some
mechanical alterations; sails were not used, and it was found she could
stem the strong tide and a fresh headwind. The vessel also was visited
by the officers of French men-of-war at anchor in the harbor.

On July 4, 1815, she was given another trial. She left Fulton&rsquo;s works at
Corlear&rsquo;s Hook at 9 a.m., ran out to Sandy Hook Lighthouse, bore west
and returned, a total of 53 miles under steam, reaching her slip at 5:20
p.m. She was found to steer &ldquo;like a pilot boat.&rdquo; This prolonged trial
revealed that the stokehold was not sufficiently ventilated and more
deck openings were required. The windsails used in existing hatches were
inadequate. The paddle wheel was too low and had to be raised 18 inches,
and there were still some desirable modifications to be made in the
machinery.

On September 11, 1815, she was again given a trial run. All alterations
had been made, including the addition of hatches and raising the paddle
wheel, and her battery was on board with all stores, supplies, and
equipment. She had 26 long guns (32-pdr.), mounted on pivoted carriages,
and now drew 10 feet 4 inches. On this day she left her slip at 8:38
a.m. and went through the Narrows into the Lower Bay, where she
maneuvered around the new frigate Java at anchor there. The battery
then was given a thorough trial under steam and sail and, with the ship
underway, her guns were fired to see if concussion would damage the
machinery. The vessel was found to be a practical one, capable of
meeting the government&rsquo;s requirements in all respects; her speed was
51/2 knots. However, the stokehold temperature had reached 116&deg;
Fahrenheit! She returned to her slip at 7:00 p.m.

On December 28, 1815, the Committee in a written report to the
Secretary of the Navy,
[5] gave a description of the vessel and praised
her performance. At this time a set of plans was made by &ldquo;Mr. Morgan,&rdquo;
[145]
of whom no other reference has appeared, and sent to the Navy
Department. These cannot now be found. The Committee recommended the
battery be commissioned and used for training purposes. This suggestion
was not followed.

The ship remained in her slip during the winter, and in June 1816 she
was turned over to the Navy and delivered to Captain Samuel Evans,
commandant of the New York Navy Yard. Captain Joseph Bainbridge was
assigned to her command. However, she was not commissioned and soon
after her delivery she was housed over and placed &ldquo;in ordinary,&rdquo; that
is, laid up. The final settlement showed that the Committee, as Navy
agents, had paid out $286,162.12 with $872.00 unpaid, as well as a claim
for $3,364.00 by Adam and Noah Brown, making a total of $290,398.12.

The following year, on June 18, 1817, she was unroofed and put into
service with a small crew. With President James Monroe on board, she
left the Navy Yard about noon for a short trip to the Narrows and then
to Staten Island and returned in the evening. The next day she was again
placed &ldquo;in ordinary.&rdquo;

Four years later, in 1821, when her guns and machinery were removed, it
was found that she was rapidly becoming rotten. She was then utilized as
a receiving ship. At 2:30 p.m. on June 4, 1829, she blew up, killing 24
men and 1 woman, with 19 persons listed as injured. Among those killed
was one officer, Lt. S. M. Brackenridge. Two lieutenants and a Sailing
Master were hurt, four midshipmen were severely injured, and five
persons were listed as missing. The explosion of 21/2 barrels of
condemned gunpowder was sufficient, due to her rotten condition, to
destroy the ship completely. A Court of Inquiry blamed a 60-year-old
gunner, who supposedly entered a magazine with a candle to get powder
for the evening gun. It was stated to the court that about 300 pounds of
powder in casks and in cartridges was on board the ship at the
time.[3]

She was not replaced until the coast-defense steamer Fulton was built
in 1837-38, though in 1822 the Navy purchased for $16,000 a &ldquo;steam
galliot&rdquo; of 100 tons, the Sea Gull, to be used as a dispatch boat for
the West Indian squadron engaged in suppressing piracy during 1823. In
1825 she was laid up at Philadelphia, and in 1840 she was sold for
$4,750.

It is a curious fact that the battery did not receive an official name,
as did the sailing blockship on the ways at New Orleans, which at the
end of the War of 1812 was officially listed as the Tchifonta. Nor was
the battery given a number, as were the gunboats. In official
correspondence and lists, the steam battery is referred to as the
&ldquo;Fulton Steam Frigate,&rdquo; or as the &ldquo;Steam Battery,&rdquo; but in later years
she was referred to as the &ldquo;Fulton&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fulton the First.&rdquo; Perhaps the
explanation is that as she was the only one of her kind she was not
numbered, and as she was not considered fit for coastal or extended
ocean voyages, she was not given a name.


Surviving Designs for Floating Batteries

The designs of American blockships that have survived are those of the
Tchifonta,
[6] 145 feet long, 43-foot moulded beam, 8-foot 6-inch depth
in hold, and about 152 feet 9 inches on deck. She was to carry a battery
of 22 long guns (32-pdr.), on the main deck 12 carronades (42-pdr.), on
forecastle and quarter decks. She was to have been rigged to rather
lofty and very square topgallant sails, and would have been capable of
sailing fairly well, though of rather shoal draft, drawing only about 8
feet 6 inches when ready for service. She was sold on the stocks at the
end of the war and her later history is not known.

Another and earlier design for a blockship, or floating battery, was
prepared by Christian Bergh for Captain Charles Stewart in 1806. This
was a sailing vessel for the defense of the port of New York, planned to
mount 40 guns (32-pdr.), on her two lower decks and 14 carronades
(42-pdr.), on her spar deck. She was to be 103 feet 6 inches between
perpendiculars, a 44-foot moulded beam, 10-foot depth of hold, and
drawing about 9 feet when ready for service. She was intended to be
ship-rigged, but was never built.
[7] A few small sloop-rigged block
vessels also were built during Jefferson&rsquo;s administration. The
sloop-of-war Saratoga, built on Lake Champlain by the Browns, in 1813,
was practically a blockship. A plan for a proposed &ldquo;Guard Ship,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Floating Battery,&rdquo; was made by James Marsh at Charleston, South
Carolina, in 1814. This was an unrigged battery, 200 feet extreme
length, 50-foot moulded beam, 9-foot depth of hold, to mount 32 guns
(42-pdr.), on a flush deck, with a covering deck
above.[8]

[146]

[147]

Through the courtesy of the trustees of the National Maritime Museum,
Greenwich, England, the Rigsarkivet, Copenhagen, Denmark, and the
Statens Sj&ouml;historiska Museum, Stockholm, Sweden, the author has been
able to illustrate in this article the designs of some of the early
floating batteries.

In the last quarter of the 18th century and later, the Danes had built
sail-propelled floating batteries or blockships, which were employed in
the defense of Copenhagen. The British built at least one sail-propelled
battery, the Spanker, in 1794. This was a scow of very angular form
with overhanging gun-deck, bomb-ketch-rigged, and about 120 feet overall
42-foot 4 inches moulded beam and 8-foot depth of hold. She is said to
have been a failure due to her unseaworthy proportions and form; the
overhanging gun deck and sides were objected to in particular. She is
called a &ldquo;Stationary Battery&rdquo; in her plans, which are in the Admiralty
Collection of Draughts, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.

Controversial Descriptions

The contemporary descriptions of the Fulton Steam Battery do not
agree. This was in part due to differences between the dimensions given
out by Fulton during the negotiations with the Federal Government, and
after the ship&rsquo;s construction was authorized. From the context of
various statements concerning the projected vessel, such as that of the
naval officers, the changes in the intended dimensions of the ship can
be seen. For example, the officers state the model and plan shown them
would produce a battery carrying 24 guns (24- and 32-pdrs.), and a letter
from Fulton to Jones,
[9] shows she was to be 138 feet on deck and
55-foot beam. The final reported dimensions, given by the Supervisory
Committee,
[10] are 156 feet length,
56 feet beam, and 20 feet depth.

In addition there are a few foreign accounts which give dimensions and
descriptions. The most complete was probably that of Jean Baptiste
Marestier, a French naval constructor who visited the United States soon
after the end of the War of 1812 and published a report on American
steamboats in 1824.
[11] The Steam Battery is barely mentioned though a
drawing of one of her boilers is given. Marestier made another report on
the American Navy, however. Extensive searches have been made for this
in Paris over the last 14 years, but this paper has not been found in
any of the French archives. References to the original text indicate
that the naval report dealt very extensively with the Steam Battery.
Some of his comments on the battery appeared in Proc&egrave;s-verbaux des
S&eacute;ances de l&rsquo;Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences.
[12] Marestier considered the powers
of the battery to have been overrated due to fanciful accounts of some
laymen writers. He was aware of the shortcomings of the double hull in a
steam vessel at the then-possible speeds, but he apparently thought two
engines, one in each hull and each with its boilers would be better than
Fulton&rsquo;s arrangement of boilers in one hull and engine in the other. He
noted that the paddle wheel turned 16-18 rpm and that steam pressure
sustained a column of mercury 25 to 35 centimeters. The safety valve was
set at 50 centimeters. Fuel consumption was 35/8 cords of pine wood per
hour.

In view of the access Marestier is known to have had to American naval
constructors, shipbuilders, and engineers, it is highly probable that he
not only obtained the building plan of the ship but also some of the
earlier project plans from the builders and from Fulton&rsquo;s
superintendent, Stoudinger. It is, therefore, a great misfortune that
his lengthy report on the Battery cannot be produced.

A French naval officer who investigated the ship, M. Montg&eacute;ry, also
wrote a description, published in &ldquo;Notice sur la Vie et les Travaux de
Robert Fulton.&rdquo;[13]

[148]






Figure 5.&mdash;Floating battery Spanker built, in England
by William Barnard, at Deptford on the Thames, and launched June 14,
1794. Rigged as a bomb ketch, its length is 111 feet 7 inches in the
keel, extreme beam 42 feet 4 inches, depth of hold 8 feet. Upper deck
plan also shown.


It should be noted in regard to what Montg&eacute;ry wrote about the
Battery, that in 1821 it had been considered desirable to disarm the
ship. The engineer in charge, William Purcell, had reported that as
there were not proper scuppers, dirt and water had entered the hull and
had collected under the engine and boilers, causing damage to the hull,
and also that with guns removed, the Battery would float too high for
the paddle wheel to propel the vessel; so it had
[149]
been decided to remove all machinery as well as the armament.



Figure 5.


Montg&eacute;ry&rsquo;s description, published in 1822, was taken from his report to
the Minister of Marine and Colonies. It noted the battery was made of
two hulls separated by a channel, or &ldquo;race,&rdquo; 151/2 feet wide, running
the full length of the vessel. The two hulls were joined by a deck just
above the waterline, as well as by an upper deck, and also connected at
their keels by means of 12 oak beams each 1 foot square. The vessel was
152 feet long, 57 feet beam, and 20 feet deep. Sides were 4 feet 10
inches thick, and the ends of the hull were rounded and alike. There
were two rudders at each end, one on each hull, alongside the race. The
eight paddle blades, each 141/2 feet by 3 feet, turned in either
direction by stopping the engine piston at half-stroke and reversing the
flow of steam. Rigged with two lateen sails and two jibs, the ship
sailed either end first. The engine of 120 hp was in one hull and two
boilers were in the other. Other sources, Marestier, and Colden in
Proc&egrave;s-verbaux des S&eacute;ances de l&rsquo;Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences,
[14] gave
additional information (some of it incorrect): the engine was inclined,
with a 4-foot-diameter cylinder, 5-foot stroke, direct-connected to the
paddle wheel, which was turned at 18 rpm. The boilers were 8 &times; 22 feet
with the fireboxes in inside cylinders, each about 5 feet in diameter,
and extending about half the length of the boiler from the fire doors.
Two fire tubes, each about 3 feet in diameter, returned the gases from
the inside end of the fireboxes to the stacks at the firing end. Except
at the fire-door end, the firebox was completely surrounded by water.
The boiler pressure of about 6 psi was not maintained, varying somewhat
with each stroke of the engine.

Water level in the boilers was indicated by try cocks. The safety valve
was controlled by a counterbalanced lever. A jet of salt water was
injected into the exhaust trunk to form a vacuum by condensation. An air
pump transferred condensate and sea water into a tank from which it
passed overboard. Only about a tenth of this water was returned to the
boilers.

Montg&eacute;ry stated also that only the lower or gun deck was to be armed. No
bulwarks were on the spar deck, only iron stanchions to which were
fastened a breastwork of wet cotton bales when the Steam Battery was
in action.

The Battery was designed to carry 30 guns (32-pdr.), with 3 guns in
each end and 12 on each side, but no guns in the wake of paddle wheel
and machinery. Hatches to give air to the stokehold were located
amidships. The Battery was to have been supplemented at the ends of
each hull by a Columbiad &ldquo;submarine gun&rdquo; (100-pdr.), Fulton&rsquo;s invention,
but these were not fitted. Provision was to be made in the fireboxes for
heating shot, and a force pump with a cylinder 33 inches in diameter was
employed to throw a stream of cold water, about 60-80 gallons per
minute, for a distance of about two hundred feet. This could be done
only when the paddle wheel was not in operation. The paddle wheel was
housed, the top fitted with stairs to the spar deck. The gun deck, over
the race, was used in part for staterooms, of which the bulkheads were
permanent. Hammocks for the complement of 500 men were to be slung on
the rest of the gun deck. The ship drew 10 feet 4 inches, with the port
sills about 51/2 feet above the loadline. Burning wood, the vessel
could carry about 4 days&rsquo; supply of fuel; burning coal, she carried 12
days&rsquo; supply.

Montg&eacute;ry said that the vessel would be vulnerable to bombshells and hot
shot, and that furthermore she could be boarded. The displacement of the
ship, at service draft, was 1,450 tons, a figure Montg&eacute;ry
[150]
obtained from
a copy of the original plan given him by Noah Brown.




Figure 6.&mdash;French sketch, in Rigsarkivet, Copenhagen, of
inboard profile and arrangement of Fulton&rsquo;s Steam Battery, showing
details of the Fulton engine, probably taken from one of his preliminary
designs.


In 1935, Lieutenant Ralph R. Gurley, USN, attempted a reconstruction in
sketches of the vessel published in his article &ldquo;The U.S.S. Fulton the
First&rdquo; in the U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings.
[15] This
reconstruction was based on the Patent Office drawing prepared for
Fulton, and published by Stuart and Bennett, and the foregoing French
sources. The Patent Office drawing showed the engine was an inclined
cylinder and Lt. Gurley shows this in his sketch; in his text (p. 323)
he says, &ldquo;The engine was an inclined, single-cylinder affair with a
4-foot base and a 5-foot stroke.&rdquo; Gurley&rsquo;s attempt to reconstruct the
Steam Battery is the only one known to the author.

Copenhagen Plans

In 1960, Kjeld Rasmussen, naval architect of the Danish Greenland
Company, was requested by the author to inspect in the Danish Royal
Archives at Copenhagen a folio of American ship plans, the index of
which had listed some Civil War river monitors. Mr. Rasmussen found the
monitor plans had been withdrawn but discovered that three plans of
Fulton&rsquo;s Steam Battery existed, as well as plans of the first
Princeton, a screw sloop-of-war.

Copies of the Steam Battery&rsquo;s plans were obtained at Copenhagen in
September 1960 through the courtesy of the archivist, and were found to
consist of the lines, copied in 1817, an inboard profile and
arrangement, and a sail and rigging plan. From these the reconstruction
for a scale model was drawn and is presented here with reproductions of
the original drawings upon which the reconstruction is based.

It is apparent that Montg&eacute;ry&rsquo;s description is generally accurate. The
vessel is a catamaran, made of two hulls, double-ended and exactly
alike. The outboard sides are &ldquo;moulded,&rdquo; with round bilges, the inboard
sides are straight and flat, as though a
[151]
hull had been split along the
middle line and then planked up flat where split. The hulls are
separated by the race, in which the paddle wheel is placed at
mid-length. The topsides are made elliptical at the ends, and the
midsection shows a marked tumble-home over the thick topside planking
but less on the moulded lines.




Figure 6.


The lines plan agreed rather closely to Montg&eacute;ry&rsquo;s description of the
hull. After careful fairing it was found the lines drawing would produce
a vessel 153 feet 2 inches overall outside the stems, or about 151 feet
over the planked rabbets, with a moulded beam of 56 feet and extreme
beam of 58 feet. The moulded depth was 22 feet 9 inches and the width of
the race was 14 feet 10 inches, plank to plank. The room and space of
framing shown was 2 feet. The designed draft appears to be 13 feet and
this would bring the port sills 5 feet 6 inches above the loadline and
the underside of the gun-deck beams about 2 feet 9 inches above the
loadline.

The lines plan is a Danish copy, probably of the building plan by Noah
Brown, and may be based on the plan Montg&eacute;ry obtained from Brown. The
spar deck has the iron stanchions (Gurley translated these as
&ldquo;chandeliers&rdquo;) which are set inboard 4 feet from the plank-sheer. This
gives room for cotton bales, outboard the stanchions, to form a
barricade. As will be seen by comparing the original Danish drawing with
the model drawing, the construction indicates that the iron stanchions
should be carried around the ends of the hull in the same manner as
along the sides, since the lower ends of the iron stanchions pass
through the spar deck and are secured to the inside of the inner ceiling
of the gun deck. The rudders are as shown in the Danish drawing, and it
is supposed that they were operated ferryboat fashion, one at each end
of the vessel. Hence, each pair of rudders was toggled together by a
cross-yoke. This was probably operated by a tiller (possibly the
cross-yokes and tillers were of iron) pivoted under the beams of the gun deck
[152]
close to the ends of the ship. Tiller ropes led from a tackle under
the gun-deck through trunks to the spar deck, where the wheels were
placed. This allowed proper sweep to the tillers and operation of each
pair of rudders. The paddle wheel was apparently of iron, with wooden
blades, and agrees with Montg&eacute;ry&rsquo;s description. In the plan for the
model it is shown raised 18 inches above the original design position,
to agree with trial requirements.

It should be observed that the close CL-to-CL frame spacing created a
hull having frames touching one another, at least to above the turn of
the bilge, so the vessel was almost solid timber, before being planked
and ceiled, from keel to about the loadline. The sides are not only
heavily planked but, after the frames were ceiled with extraordinarily
heavy, square timbering, a supplementary solid, vertical framing was
introduced inboard and another ceiling added. The sides scale about 5
feet from outside the plank to the inboard face of the inner ceiling at
the level of the gunports.

The hulls were tied together athwartship by the deck beams of the gun
deck and spar deck, except in the wake of the paddle wheel. Knees were
placed along the sides of the race at alternate gun-deck beams. In
addition, the 12 1-foot-square timbers, crossing the race at the rabbets
of the hulls, (mentioned by Montg&eacute;ry) are shown. These must have created
extraordinary resistance, even at the low speed of this steamer. The
deck details shown are the results of reconstruction of the inboard
works.

History of Double-Hull Craft

The use of catamaran hulls, or &ldquo;double-hulls,&rdquo; has been periodically
popular with ship designers since the time of Charles II of England. The
earliest of such vessels known in the present day were four sloops or
shallops designed 1673-1687 by Sir William Petty, who was an inventor in
the field of naval architecture and received some attention from Charles
II and from the Royal Society.

The first Petty experiment, the Simon &amp; Jude,
later
called Invention I, was launched October 28, 1662. She was designed with two hulls
cylindrical in cross section, each 2 feet in diameter, and 20 feet long.
A platform connected the hulls, giving the boat a beam of a little over
9 feet. She had a 20-foot mast stepped on one of the crossbeams
connecting the hulls, with a single gaff sail. In sailing trials she
beat three fast boats: the King&rsquo;s barge, a large pleasure boat, and a
man-of-war&rsquo;s boat. This
[153]
&ldquo;double-bottom,&rdquo; also called a &ldquo;sluiceboat&rdquo; or
&ldquo;cylinder,&rdquo; was later lengthened at the stern to make her 30 feet
overall.




Figure 7.


The King did not support Petty, to the latter&rsquo;s great disappointment,
and Petty next built a larger double-bottom, Invention II. This
catamaran was lapstrake construction. Not much is known of this boat
except that she beat the regular Irish packet boat, running between
Holyhead and Dublin, in a race each way, winning a &pound;20 wager. She was
launched in July 1663; what became of her was not recorded.

A third and still larger boat, the Experiment, launched December 22,
1664, appears to have been a large sloop. This vessel sailed by way of
the Thames in April 1665 and went to Oporto, Portugal. She left Portugal
October 20, 1665, for home, but apparently went down with all hands in a
severe storm.

For 18 years Petty did no more with the type, but finally, in July
1684, he laid down a still larger sloop
[155]
with two decks and a mast
standing 55 feet above her upper deck. She was named St. Michael the
Archangel and is probably the design in Pepys&rsquo; Book of Miscellaneous
Illustrations in Magdalene College, Cambridge, England. This vessel
proved unmanageable and was a complete failure.

show hydrodynamic form of the Steam Battery.


Though the double canoes of the Pacific Islands were probably known to
some in Europe in 1662, there is no evidence that Petty based his
designs on such craft. He appears to have produced his designs
spontaneously from independent observations and resulting theories.
Before Petty concluded his experiments, a number of double-hull craft
had been produced by others; however, some &ldquo;double&rdquo; craft, such as
&ldquo;double shallops&rdquo; may have been &ldquo;double-enders,&rdquo; as shown by a
&ldquo;double-moses boat&rdquo; of the 18th century and
later.
[16]

The use of two canoes, joined by a platform or by poles was common in
colonial times; in Maryland and Virginia, dugouts so joined were used to
transport tobacco down the tidal creeks to vessels&rsquo; loading. Such craft
were also used as ferries. M. V. Brewington&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Log
Canoes
[17]
and Paul Wilstack&rsquo;s Potomac Landings
[18] illustrate canoes
used in this manner. A catamaran galley, two round-bottom hulls, flat on
the inboard side (a hull split along the centerline and the inboard
faces planked up), 113 feet long and each hull a 7-foot moulded beam,
6-foot 6 inches moulded depth, and placed 13 feet apart, was proposed by
Sir Sidney Smith, R.N., in the 1790&rsquo;s, and built by the British
Admiralty. Named Taurus, she is shown by the Admiralty draught to have
been a double-ender, with cabins amidships on the platform, an iron
rudder at each end (between the hulls) steered with tillers (to unship),
and with a ramp at one end. The plans are undated, signed by Captain Sir
Sidney Smith, and a field-carriage gun is shown at the ramp end of the
boat. This, and the heavy rocker in the keels, suggests the Taurus was
intended for a landing boat. No sailing rig is indicated, but tholes for
12 oars or sweeps on each side are shown. The oarsmen apparently sat on
deck, or on low seats, with stretchers in hatches
[156]between each pair of
tholes (Admiralty Collection of Draughts, The National Maritime Museum,
Greenwich, England).

galley gunboat proposed by Sir Sidney Smith, R.N., to the British
Admiralty in the early years of the French Revolution. From the
Admiralty Collection of Draughts, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.


Another experimenter with the double-hull type of vessel was a wealthy
Scot named Patrick Miller who was particularly interested in manual
propulsion of vessels, employing geared capstans to operate paddle
wheels. In a letter dated June 9, 1790, Miller offered Gustav III of
Sweden a design for a double-hulled 144-gun ship-of-the-line (rating as
a 130-gun ship) propelled by manually operated capstans connected to a
paddle wheel between the hulls. She was rigged to sail, with five masts
and was to be 246 feet long, 63 feet beam, and 17 feet draft; the hulls
were 16 feet apart.

This project was submitted by the King to Fredrik Henrik af Chapman, the
great Swedish naval architect, who made an adverse report. Chapman
pointed out in great detail that the weight of the armament, the
necessary hull structure, the stores, crew, ammunition, spars, sails,
rigging and gear, would greatly exceed Miller&rsquo;s designed displacement.
He also pointed out the prime fault of catamarans under sail&mdash;slow
turning in stays. He suggested that the speed under sail would be
disappointing. He doubted that a double-hull ship of such size could be
built strong enough to stand a heavy sea. He remarked that English
records showed that a small vessel of the catamaran type had been built
between 1680 and 1700 which had sailed well (this may have been one of
Petty&rsquo;s boats), and that &ldquo;36 years ago&rdquo; he had seen 8 miles from London,
a similar boat that had been newly built by Lord Baltimore and was about
50 feet long; this was a failure and was discarded after one trial.
Therefore, said Chapman, the Miller project was not new but rather an
old idea. Chapman&rsquo;s final remark is perhaps the best illustration of his
opinion of the catamaran, &ldquo;Despite all this, two-hull vessels are
completely sound when the theory can be properly applied; that is in
vessels of very light weight, and of small size, with crews of one or
two men.&rdquo;

A &ldquo;model&rdquo; of such a double-hull ship&mdash;the Experiment, built at Leith,
Scotland, in 1786 by J.
[157]
Laurie&mdash;was sent to Sweden by Miller. She was
105 feet long, 31 feet beam, and cost &pound;3000. This vessel arrived in the
summer of 1790 and King Gustav in a letter dated July 26 ordered Col.
Michael Anckersw&auml;rd to welcome the vessel at Stockholm. The King
presented Miller with a gold snuffbox and a painting was made of the
vessel. The Experiment had five paddle wheels in tandem between her
hulls, operated by geared capstans on deck. These gave her a speed of 5
knots but caused the crew to suffer from exhaustion in a short time. The
vessel was badly strained in a storm and was finally abandoned at St.
Petersburg, Russia.[19]




Figure 12.


Miller later turned to the idea of employing steam instead of manual
power and built a 25-foot double-hulled pleasure boat of iron fitted
with a steam engine built by William Symington. Also named Experiment,
she was an apparent success, so Miller had a 60-foot boat built of the
double-hull design and fitted with an engine built by Symington. She
reached a speed of 7 mph on the Forth and Clyde Canal. However, Miller
lost interest when he found that the Symington engine was unreliable and
that Great Britain showed very little public support for such projects.

Fulton was acquainted with Symington&rsquo;s work and probably had heard of
Miller&rsquo;s vessels. At any rate, he employed the double-hull principle in
his steam ferryboats, the first of which was the Jersey, a 188-ton
vessel built by Charles Browne, which began service July 2, 1812. The
next year he had a sister ship built, the York. These vessels were
based on his patent drawing of 1809. In 1814 he had another vessel of
this type built, the Nassau. It was, therefore, logical that he should
apply this design to the Steam Battery. The double-hull design had
worked well in these ferries, and the design would give protection from
shot to the paddle wheel. The Battery would have the ability to run
forward or astern so as not to be exposed to a raking fire from the
enemy while maneuvering in action. The application of this &ldquo;ferryboat&rdquo;
principle to the Battery reduced the need for extreme maneuverability,
the catamaran&rsquo;s weakest point, even at low speed.

The resistance factors in the design are of relatively small importance,
for the speed possible under steam in this period was very low. However,
the plans show an apparently efficient hull form for the power
available, aside from the drag of the beams across the race in the
vicinity of the keel. The displacement was adequate. The height of the
gun-deck above the water at the race made the Battery unsuitable for
rough-water operation, but there is no evidence that Fulton or the
sponsors of the vessel considered the Battery as a coastwise or
seagoing steamer. However, the clearance of the gun deck above the water
and the dip of the paddle wheel would have made the additional weight of
an upper- or spar-deck battery prohibitive even had experience in action
proven it desirable.



Sail and Inboard Plans

[158]




Figure 13.&mdash;Lines of Taurus.
From the Admiralty Collection of Draughts, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.



The sail and rigging plan is likewise a Danish copy and shows the
two-masted lateen rig employed. The hull is shown with bulwarks and
gunports on the spar deck but no other evidence that the Battery was
finished in this manner has been found. The rig resembles that of some
of Josiah Fox&rsquo;s designs for Jeffersonian gunboats&mdash;double-enders
designed to sail in either direction but without the jibs. The topmasts
[159]
do not appear to be more than signal poles and apparently were not
fitted with sails; however, some European lateeners did have triangular
topsails over a lateen and it is possible the Battery may have carried
such sails. Considering the stability and displacement of the Battery,
the rig is very small and not sufficiently effective. Shrouds were not
required; the masts were supported by runners that were shifted when the
yards were reversed, and in tacking. Apparently the jibstays also could
be slacked off so that the lateen yards would not have to be dipped
under them.




Figure 14.&mdash;Rudder detail
of Taurus. From the Admiralty Collection of Draughts,
National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.


The inboard profile is on tracing paper and the notes are in French.
This drawing is of a simplified hull form having flat-bottom hulls with
chines. It is possible that this is a tracing of a preliminary drawing
obtained by Marestier or Montg&eacute;ry, but no documentation can be found.
Its importance is that it shows in some detail the engine and boilers,
as well as the wheelbox, and another drawing of the paddle wheel, more
or less duplicating the wheel shown in the Danish plan. No details of
the deck arrangements are shown in any of the plans, except for the dome
skylight over the fireroom in the boiler hull.

Both the lines plan and the inboard drawing show construction
midsections and hull connections. These plans show that the engine was
not inclined, but rather was vertical, contrary to Fulton&rsquo;s patent
drawing. The piston rod and the crosshead obviously passed through its
gun deck in a large hatch. Also it is plain that there must have been
large hatches afore and abaft the wheelbox to make the stepped wheelbox
construction desirable. There also must have been a hatch in the gun
deck under the domed skylight. It is improbable that the engine and
skylight hatches were used for ladderways, passing scuttles, or
companionways.

The boilers are shown in the inboard profile about as described and
drawn by Marestier but with two stacks on each boiler, one to each flue;
Marestier&rsquo;s sketch in his report on American steamships shows the flues
of each boiler trunked into a single stack. The battery had two boilers
and the stacks are at the boilers&rsquo; fire-door end. The steam lines came
off the crown of the boilers and probably passed through the ends of the
wheelbox to the engine; a trunk for the steam lines would undoubtedly
have been necessary.

[160]

Figure 16.&mdash;Patrick Miller&rsquo;s
manually propelled (paddle-wheel) catamaran ship Experiment, built at Leith,
Scotland, 1786. Scale drawing in Statens Sj&ouml;historiska Museum, Stockholm


The engine is shown to have had counterbalanced side levers, one on
each side, and a single flywheel on the outboard side. The cylinder is
over the condenser or &ldquo;cistern,&rdquo; connected by the steam line and valve
box on the side. The cylinder crosshead is shown in the inboard profile
to have reached the underside of the beams of the upper deck. The
crosshead was connected by two connecting rods to the side levers. These
levers operated the paddle wheel by connecting rods to cranks on the
paddle-wheel shaft. There is
[161]
another pair of connecting rods from the
side levers to the crosshead of the air pump. All connecting rods are on
one arm of the side levers, the other end having only a counterbalance
weight beyond the fulcrum bearing. The flywheel has a shaft fitted with
two gears, and is driven through idler gears from gears on the
paddle-wheel shaft; it turns at about twice the speed of the paddle
wheel. No other pumps or fittings are shown in the engine hull, although
manual pumps were probably fitted to fill and empty the boilers. Piping
is not shown.




Figure 17.&mdash;Painting of the
Experiment in the Statens Sj&ouml;historiska Museum, Stockholm.



The four rudders, toggled in pairs, are shown in both the lines and
inboard drawings, but the shape is different in the two plans. Operation
must have been by a tiller under the gun-deck beams. The outer end of
the tiller may have been pivoted on the toggle bar and the inboard end
fitted, as previously described, with steering cable or chain tackles.
This seems to be the only practical interpretation of the evidence.


Reconstructing the Plans

In the model it was necessary to reconstruct the deck arrangements
without enough contemporary description. The outboard appearance and
hull form, rig, and arrangement of armament require no reconstruction,
for all that is of importance is shown in the lines and rig drawings, or
in the inboard profile. The masts are shown to have been stepped over
the race on the gun deck. The iron stanchions are shown in the lines
drawing and in the construction section. However, their position at the
ends of the Battery are apparently incorrectly shown in the original
lines plan. The construction section shows these stanchions to have been
stepped on the inside face of the inner ceiling and, as the ceiling
structure was carried completely around the ship, the stanchions in the
ends must have been placed inboard, as along the sides. The bowsprit was
above deck and would probably be secured in the knighthead timbers at
[162]
the ends of the hull, as well as by the heel bitts shown in the Danish
lines drawing. With the riding bitts shown inboard of the heel bitts at
each end of the vessel, it is obvious that she would work her ground
tackle at both ends and would therefore require two capstans; the
wheelbox would prevent effective use of a single one. The capstans might
be doubleheaded, as in some large frigates and ships-of-the-line.




Figure 18.&mdash;Sail plan of Fulton&rsquo;s
Steam Battery as reconstructed for model in the Museum of History and Technology.



As to the remaining deck fixtures, hatches and fittings, these must be
entirely a matter of speculation. Ladderways, passing scuttles, hatches,
trunks, galley, heads and cabins were obviously required in a fighting
ship and can only be located on the theory that, when completed, the
Battery was a practical vessel.

It has been stated that the officers&rsquo; cabins were over the race; the
logical place for the heads, galley, wardroom and mess also would be
over the race, giving the remaining part of the gun deck for the
necessary hatches, ladderways, trunks, etc., in the two hulls, space
required for armament, and to sling the hammocks of a watch below. As
the vessel was never fully manned, apparently, the space for hammocks is
not a serious problem in a reconstruction. If the vessel had been manned
as proposed by 500 men, hammocks for over 200 would have been required,
which would give very crowded quarters in view of the limited space
available.

Though no specific requirements were stated in the reports of the
trials, it seems reasonable to suppose that additional hatches were cut
in the decks to improve the fireroom ventilation. In the reconstruction
drawings, these hatchways as well as the other deck openings and deck
fittings&mdash;such as bilge pumps, companionways, skylights, binnacles,
wheels and wheel-rope trunks, cable trunks, steampipe casings, and stack
fiddleys&mdash;have been located in an effort to meet the imagined
requirements of the working of a ship of this unusual form.

There are some unanswered questions that arose in the preparation of
the reconstruction drawings. As has been shown, the original inboard
arrangement plan found in Copenhagen shows four smokestacks, while
Marestier&rsquo;s sketch of the vessel&rsquo;s boilers shows
[165]
trunked flues
indicating that two stacks were used. It is possible that the boilers
were first fitted so that four stacks were required; alterations made as
a result of steaming trials may well have included the introduction of
trunked flues and the final use of two stacks in line fore-and-aft. This
would have required a rearrangement of the fiddley hatches amidships.

Another troublesome question was the doubtful arrangement of the four
companionways on the spar deck. Perhaps only two were fitted, one on
each side of the officers&rsquo; staterooms while the ladderways at the crew&rsquo;s
end of the ship were simple ladder hatches.

The decision to use four bilge pumps is based upon the lack of drag in
the keel of the hulls, which would prevent accumulation of bilge water
at one end of the hull. The use of four single-barrel pumps instead of
four double-barrel pumps may be questioned, for chain pumps requiring
two barrels would have been practical.

Allowance for stores was made by use of platforms in the hold. It is
known from statements made to the Court of Inquiry, that the magazines
were amidships and that a part of these was close to the boilers. Fuel
and water would be in the lower hold under the platforms; hatches and
ladderways are arranged to permit fueling the ship.

A few prints or drawings of the ship, aside from the patent drawing,
have been found. There are two prints that show the launch of the
vessel. One, a print of 1815, is in possession of the Mariners&rsquo; Museum,
Newport News, Va., and is reproduced in Alexander Crosby Brown&rsquo;s Twin
Ships, Notes on the Chronological History of the Use of Multiple Hulled
Vessels.[20]
A poor copy of this print appears on page 13 of Bennett&rsquo;s
Steam Navy of the United States, and another and inaccurate sketch is
shown on page 8. These pictures were of no use in the reconstruction as
they show no details that are not in the Copenhagen plans. The patent
drawing does not show deck details and in fact does not represent the
vessel as built in any respect other than in being a catamaran with
paddle wheel amidships between the hulls.

The Steam Battery did not have any particular influence on the design
of men-of-war that followed her. In the first place, steampower was not
viewed with favor by naval officers generally. This was without doubt
due to prejudice, but engines in 1820-30 were still unreliable when
required to run for long periods, as experienced by the early
ocean-going steamers. The great weight of the early steam engines and
their size in relation to power were important, and also important were
practical objections that prevented the design of efficient naval ocean
steamers until about 1840; even then, the paddle wheels made them very
vulnerable in action. Until the introduction of the screw propellor it
was not possible to design a really effective ocean-going naval steamer;
hence until about 1840-45, sail remained predominant in naval vessels
for ocean service, and steamers were accepted only in coast defense and
towing services, or as dispatch vessels.

No immediate use of the double hull in naval vessels of the maritime
powers resulted from the construction of the Steam Battery. The
flat-bottom chine-built design employed by Fulton in North River,
Raritan, and other early steamboats was utilized in the design for a
projected steamer by the British Admiralty in 1815-16. This vessel was
about 76 feet overall, 16-foot beam, and 8-foot 10 inches depth in hold.
Her design was for a flat-bottom, chine-built hull with no fore-and-aft
camber in the bottom, a sharp entrance, and a square-tuck stern with
slight overhang above the cross-seam. Her side frames were straight and
vertical amidships, but curved as the bow and stern were approached. She
was to be a side-paddle-wheel steamer, and her hull was diagonally
braced; the wheel and engine were to be about amidships where she was
dead flat for about 14 feet. However, the engine and boilers were not
installed; the engine was utilized ashore for pumping, and the vessel
was completed in the Deptford Yard as a sailing ship. Under the name
Congo she was employed in the African coast survey. Her plan is in the
Admiralty Collection of Draughts, at the National Maritime Museum,
Greenwich, England.

The double hull continued to be employed in both steam and team
ferryboats in the United States and in England and France. A few river
and lake steamers were also built with this design of hull. Continued
efforts to obtain fast sailing by use of the double hull produced a
number of sailing catamarans; of these the Herreshoff catamarans of the
1870&rsquo;s showed high speed when reaching in a fresh breeze.

Designs for double-hulled steamers appeared during the last half of the
19th century; in 1874 the Castalia, a large, double-hull, iron,
cross-channel steamer, was built by the Thames Iron-works Company at
[166]
Blackwall, England. She was 290 feet long, and each hull had a beam of
17 feet. The paddle wheel was placed between the hulls and, ready for
sea, she drew 61/2 feet. She ran the 22 miles between Dover and Calais
in 1 hour and 50 minutes, a speed much slower than that of the
paddle-wheel, cross-channel steamers having one hull. Another
double-hull steamer was built for this service by Hawthorn, Leslie and
Company, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Scotland, in 1877. First named Express,
she was renamed Calais-Douvres when she went into service in May 1878.
Her length was 302 feet, her extreme beam 62 feet, and each hull had a
beam of 18 feet, 3 inches. She drew 6-foot 71/2 inches ready for sea
and the paddle wheel was between the hulls. On her trials she made 14
knots and burned coal excessively. Sold to France in 1880, she was taken
out of service in 1889. Though popular, she was not faster than the
single-hull steamers in this service and had been a comparatively
expensive vessel to build and operate.

The many attempts to produce a very fast double-hull steamer and large
sailing vessels have led to disappointment for their designers and
sponsors. In the history of naval architecture, since Petty&rsquo;s time,
there have been a number of periods when the new-old idea of the double
hull has become popular. Craft of this type have been commonly well
publicized but, on the whole, their basic designs have followed the same
principles over and over again and have not produced the sought-for
increase in speed and handiness.

[167]

In very recent years there has been a revival in interest in sailing
double-hull boats that is enthusiastic as to very small craft and
somewhat restrained as to large boats. A few projects are under
development for double-hull craft, power and sail, of over 90-foot
length, including an oceanographic research vessel. In general, however,
the performance of double-hull boats has shown that Chapman&rsquo;s estimate
of the type was reasonably correct and that there are limitations,
particularly in maneuverability in the double-hull craft that could have
been found by reference to the history of past experiments with the
type.


NAVAL STEAMERS.


THE DEMOLOGOS; OR, FULTON THE FIRST.

At the close of the year eighteen hundred and thirteen, Robert Fulton
exhibited to the President of the United States, the original drawing
from which the engraving on Plate One is sketched, being a
representation of the proposed war-steamer or floating-battery, named by
him, the Demologos. This sketch possesses more than ordinary interest,
from the circumstance that it is, doubtless, the only record of the
first war-steamer in the world, designed and drawn by the immortal
Fulton, and represented by him to the Executive, as capable of carrying
a strong battery, with furnaces for red hot shot, and being propelled by
the power of steam, at the rate of four miles an hour.

It was contemplated that this vessel, besides carrying her proposed
armament on deck, should also be furnished with submarine guns, two
suspended from each bow, so as to discharge a hundred pound ball into an
enemy&rsquo;s ship at ten or twelve feet below her water-line. In addition to
this, her machinery was calculated for the addition of an engine which
would discharge an immense column of water upon the decks, and through
the port-holes of an enemy, making her the most formidable engine for
warfare that human ingenuity has contrived.

The estimated cost of the vessel was three hundred and twenty thousand
dollars, nearly the sum requisite for a frigate of the first class.

[168]

The project was zealously embraced by the Executive, and the national
legislature in March, eighteen hundred and fourteen, passed a law,
authorizing the President of the United States to cause to be built,
equipped, and employed, one or more floating batteries, for the defense
of the waters of the United States.

The building of the vessel was committed by the Coast and Harbor Defense
Association, to a sub-committee of five gentlemen, who were recognized
by the Government as their agents for that purpose, and whose
interesting history of the Steam Frigate is copied in Note A, of the
Appendix to this volume.

Robert Fulton, whose soul animated the enterprise, was appointed the
engineer; and on the twentieth day of June, eighteen hundred and
fourteen, the keel of this novel steamer was laid at the ship-yard of
Adam and Noah Brown, her able and active constructors, in the city of
New York, and on the twenty-ninth of the following October, or in little
more than four months, she was safely launched, in the presence of
multitudes of spectators who thronged the surrounding shores, and were
seen upon the hills which limited the beautiful prospect around the bay
of New York.

The river and bay were filled with steamers and vessels of war, in
compliment to the occasion. In the midst of these was the enormous
floating mass, whose bulk and unwieldy form seemed to render her as
unfit for motion, as the land batteries which were saluting her.

In a communication from Captain David Porter, U. S. Navy, to the Hon.
Secretary of the Navy, dated New York, October 29, 1814, he states,&mdash;&ldquo;I
have the pleasure to inform you that the &ldquo;Fulton the First,&rdquo; was this
morning safely launched. No one has yet ventured to suggest any
improvement that could be made in the vessel, and to use the words of
the projector, &lsquo;I would not alter her if it were in my power to do
so.&rsquo;

&ldquo;She promises fair to meet our most sanguine expectations, and I do not
despair in being able to navigate in her from one extreme of our coast
to the other. Her buoyancy astonishes every one, she now draws only
eight feet three inches water, and her draft will only be ten feet
with all her guns, machinery, stores, and crew, on board. The ease with
which she can now be towed with a single steamboat, renders it certain
that her velocity will be sufficiently great to answer every purpose,
and the manner it is intended to secure her machinery from the gunner&rsquo;s
shot, leaves no apprehension for its safety. I shall use every exertion
to prepare her for immediate service; her guns will soon be mounted, and
I am assured by Mr. Fulton, that her machinery will be in operation in
about six weeks.&rdquo;

[169]

On the twenty-first of November, the Steam Frigate was moved from the
wharf of Messrs. Browns, in the East River, to the works of Robert
Fulton, on the North River, to receive her machinery, which operation
was performed by fastening the steamboat &ldquo;Car of Neptune,&rdquo; to her
larboard, and the steamboat &ldquo;Fulton,&rdquo; to her starboard side; they towed
her through the water from three and a-half to four miles per hour.

The dimensions of the &ldquo;Fulton the First&rdquo; were:&mdash;


Length, one hundred and fifty-six feet.

Breadth, fifty-six feet.

Depth, twenty feet.

Water-wheel, sixteen feet diameter.

Length of bucket, fourteen feet.

Dip, four feet.

Engine, forty-eight inch cylinder, and five feet stroke.

Boiler, length, twenty-two feet; breath, twelve feet; and depth,
eight feet.

Tonnage, two thousand four hundred and seventy-five.


By June, eighteen hundred and fifteen, her engine was put on board, and
she was so far completed as to afford an opportunity of trying her
machinery. On the first of June, at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the
&ldquo;Fulton the First,&rdquo; propelled by her own steam and machinery, left the
wharf near the Brooklyn ferry, and proceeded majestically into the
river; though a stiff breeze from the south blew directly ahead, she
stemmed the current with perfect ease, as the tide was a strong ebb. She
sailed by the forts and saluted them with her thirty-two pound guns. Her
speed was equal to the most sanguine expectations; she exhibited a novel
and sublime spectacle to an admiring people. The intention of the
Commissioners being solely to try her enginery, no use was made of her
sails. After navigating the bay, and receiving a visit from the officers
of the French ship of war lying at her anchors, the Steam Frigate came
to at Powles&rsquo; Hook ferry, about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, without
having experienced a single unpleasant occurrence.

On the fourth of July, of the same year, she made a passage to the ocean
and back, and went the distance, which, in going and returning, is
fifty-three miles, in eight hours and twenty minutes, without the aid of
sails; the wind and tide were partly in her favor and partly against
her, the balance rather in her favor.

In September, she made another trial trip to the ocean, and having at
this time the weight of her whole armament on board, she went at an
average of five and a half miles an hour, with and against the tide.
When stemming the tide, which ran at the rate of three miles an hour,
she advanced at the rate of two and a-half miles an hour. This
performance was not more than equal to Robert Fulton&rsquo;s expectations, but
it exceeded what he had premised to the Government, which was that she
should be propelled by steam at the rate of from three to four miles an
hour.

[170]

The English were not uninformed as to the preparations which were
making for them, nor inattentive to their progress. It is certain that
the Steam Frigate lost none of her terrors in the reports or
imaginations of the enemy. In a treatise on steam vessels, published in
Scotland at that time, the author states that he has taken great care to
procure full and accurate information of the Steam Frigate launched
in New York, and which he describes in the following words:&mdash;

&ldquo;Length on deck, three hundred feet; breadth, two hundred feet;
thickness of her sides, thirteen feet of alternate oak plank and cork
wood&mdash;carries forty-four guns, four of which are hundred pounders;
quarter-deck and forecastle guns, forty-four pounders; and further to
annoy an enemy attempting to board, can discharge one hundred gallons
of boiling water in a minute, and by mechanism, brandishes three
hundred cutlasses with the utmost regularity over her gunwales; works
also an equal number of heavy iron pikes of great length, darting them
from her sides with prodigious force, and withdrawing them every quarter
of a minute&rdquo;!!

The war having terminated before the &ldquo;Fulton the First&rdquo; was entirely
completed, she was taken to the Navy Yard, Brooklyn, and moored on the
flats abreast of that station, where she remained, and was used as a
receiving-ship until the fourth of June, eighteen hundred and
twenty-nine, when she was blown up. The following letters from Commodore
Isaac Chauncey (then Commandant of the New York Navy Yard) to the
Honorable Secretary of the Navy, informing him of the distressing event,
concludes this brief history of the first steam vessel of war ever
built.




U. S. Navy Yard, New York,
June 5th, 1829.


Sir:

It becomes my painful duty to report to you a most unfortunate
occurrence which took place yesterday, at about half past two o&rsquo;clock,
P. M., in the accidental blowing up of the Receiving Ship Fulton, which
killed twenty-four men and a woman, and wounded nineteen; there are also
five missing. Amongst the killed I am sorry to number Lieutenant S. M.
Brackenridge, a very fine, promising officer, and amongst the wounded
are, Lieutenants Charles F. Platt, and A. M. Mull, and Sailing-Master
Clough, the former dangerously, and the two last severely; there are
also four Midshipmen severely wounded. How this unfortunate accident
occurred I am not yet able to inform you, nor have I time to state more
particularly; I will, as soon as possible, give a detailed account of
the affair.


I have the honor to be, Sir,
Very respectfully,
J. CHAUNCEY.

Hon. John Branch,
Secretary of the Navy, Washington.


[171]

U.S. Navy Yard, New York,
June 8th, 1829.


Sir:

I had been on board the &ldquo;Fulton&rdquo; all the morning, inspecting the ship
and men, particularly the sick and invalids, which had increased
considerably from other ships, and whom I had intended to ask the
Department permission to discharge, as being of little use to the
service. I had left the ship but a few moments before the explosion took
place, and was in my office at the time. The report did not appear to me
louder than a thirty-two pounder, although the destruction of the ship
was complete and entire, owing to her very decayed state, for there was
not on board, at the time, more than two and a-half barrels of damaged
powder, which was kept in the magazine for the purpose of firing the
morning and evening gun. It appears to me that the explosion could not
have taken place from accident, as the magazine was as well, or better
secured, than the magazines of most of our ships, yet it would be
difficult to assign a motive to those in the magazine for so horrible an
act, as voluntarily to destroy themselves and those on board. If the
explosion was not the effect of design, I am at a loss to account for
the catastrophe.


I have the honor to be, Sir,
Very respectfully,
J. CHAUNCEY.

Hon. John Branch,
Secretary of the Navy, Washington.

Note A.

STEAM FRIGATE.

Report of Henry Rutgers,
Samuel L. Mitchel, and Thomas Morris, the
Commissioners superintending the construction of a steam vessel of war,
to the Secretary of the Navy.

&nbsp;
New York, December 28th, 1815.


Sir:

The war which was terminated by the treaty of Ghent, afforded, during
its short continuance, a glorious display of the valor of the United
States by land and by sea&mdash;it made them much better known to foreign
nations, and, what is of much greater importance, it contributed to make
them better acquainted with themselves&mdash;it excited new enterprises&mdash;it
educed latent talents&mdash;it stimulated to exertions unknown to our people
before.

A long extent of coast was exposed to an enemy, powerful above every
other on the ocean. His commanders threatened to lay waste our country
with fire and sword, and, actually, in various instances, carried their
menaces into execution. It became necessary, for our defense, to resist,
by every practicable method, such a formidable foe.

[173]

It was conceived, by a most ingenious and enterprising citizen, that
the power of Steam could be employed to propel a floating battery,
carrying heavy guns, to the destruction of any hostile force that should
hover on the shores, or enter the ports of our Atlantic frontier. The
perfect and admirable success of his project for moving boats containing
travelers and baggage by the same elastic agent, opened the way to its
employment for carrying warriors and the apparatus for fighting.

The plan was submitted to the consideration of the executive of an
enlightened government. Congress, influenced by the most liberal and
patriotic spirit, appropriated money for the experiment, and the Navy
Department, then conducted by the honorable William Jones, appointed
commissioners to superintend the construction of a convenient vessel
under the direction of Robert Fulton, the inventor, as engineer, and
Messrs. Adam and Noah Brown, as naval constructors. The enterprise, from
its commencement, and during a considerable part of its preparatory
operations, was aided by the zealous co-operation of Major General
Dearborn, then holding his head-quarters at the city of New York, as the
officer commanding the third military district. The loss of his valuable
counsel in conducting a work which he had maturely considered, and which
he strongly recommended, was the consequence of his removal to another
section of the Union, where his professional talents were specially
required.

The keels of this steam-frigate were laid on the twentieth day of June,
eighteen hundred and fourteen. The strictest blockade the enemy could
enforce interrupted the coasting trade, and greatly enhanced the price
of timber. The vigilance with which he guarded our coast against
intercourse with foreign nations, rendered difficult the importation of
copper and iron. The same impediment attended the supplies of coal
heretofore brought to New York from Richmond and Liverpool. Lead, in
like manner, was procured under additional disadvantages. These attempts
of the enemy to frustrate the design, were vain and impotent. All the
obstacles were surmounted. Scarcity of the necessary woods and metals
were overcome by strenuous exertions; and all the blockading squadron
could achieve, was not a disappointment in the undertaking, but merely
an increase of the expense.

So, in respect to tradesmen and laborers, there was an extraordinary
difficulty. Shipwrights had repaired to the lakes, for repelling the
enemy, in such numbers, that, comparatively speaking, few were left on
the seaboard. A large portion of the men who had been engaged in daily
work, had enlisted as soldiers, and had marched under the banners of the
nation to the defense of its rights&mdash;yet amidst the scarcity of hands, a
sufficient number were procured for the purpose which the Commissioners
had in charge. An increase of wages was the chief impediment, and this
they were enabled practically to overcome.

By the exemplary combination of diligence and skill, on the part of the
Engineer and Constructors, the business was so accelerated, that the
vessel was launched on the twenty-ninth day of October, amidst the
plaudits of an unusual number of citizens.

Measures were immediately taken to complete her equipment; the boiler,
the engine, and the machinery were put on board with all possible
expedition. Their weight and size far surpassed any thing that had been
witnessed before among us.

The stores of artillery in New York not furnishing the number and kind
of cannon which she was destined to carry, it became necessary to
transport guns from Philadelphia. A prize, taken from the enemy, put
some fit and excellent pieces at the disposal of the Navy Department. To
avoid the danger of capture by the enemy&rsquo;s cruisers, these were carted
over the miry roads of New Jersey. Twenty heavy cannon were thus
conveyed by the strength of horses. Carriages of the most approved model
were constructed, and every thing done to bring her into prompt action,
as an efficient instrument of war.

[174]

About this time, an officer, pre-eminent for bravery and discipline,
was commissioned by the government to her command. Prior to this event,
it had been intended by the Commissioners to finish her conformably to
the plan originally submitted to the Executive. She is a structure
resting upon two boats and keels, separated from end to end by a canal
fifteen feet wide, and sixty-six long. One boat contained the caldrons
of copper to prepare her steam. The vast cylinder of iron, with its
piston, levers, and wheels, occupied a part of its fellow; the great
water-wheel revolved in the space between them; the main or gun-deck
supported her armament, and was protected by a bulwark four feet ten
inches thick, of solid timber. This was pierced by thirty port-holes, to
enable as many thirty-two pounders to fire red hot balls; her upper or
spar deck was plain, and she was to be propelled by her enginery alone.

It was the opinion of Captain Porter and Mr. Fulton, that the upper deck
ought to be surrounded with a bulwark and stanchions&mdash;that two stout
masts should be erected to support latteen sails&mdash;that there should be
bowsprits for jibs, and that she should be rigged in a corresponding
style. Under authorities so great, and with the expectation of being
able to raise the blockade of New London, by destroying, taking, or
routing the enemy&rsquo;s ships, all these additions were adopted and
incorporated with the vessel.

It must here be observed, that during the exhaustion of the treasury,
and the temporary depression of public credit, the Commissioners were
exceedingly embarrassed&mdash;their payments were made in treasury notes,
which they were positively instructed to negotiate at par. On several
occasions even these were so long withheld, that the persons who had
advanced materials and labor were importunate for payment, and silently
discontented. To a certain extent, the Commissioners pledged their
private credit. Notwithstanding all this, the men, at one time, actually
broke off. The work was retarded, and her completion unavoidably
deferred, to the great disappointment of the Commissioners, until winter
rendered it impossible for her to act.

Under all this pressure, they, nevertheless, persevered in the important
object confided to them. But their exertions were further retarded by
the premature and unexpected death of the Engineer. The world was
deprived of his invaluable labors before he had completed this favorite
undertaking. They will not inquire, wherefore, in the dispensations of
Divine Providence, he was not permitted to realize his grand conception.
His discoveries, however, survive for the benefit of mankind, and will
extend to unborn generations.

At length all matters were ready for a trial of the machinery to urge
such a bulky vessel through the water. This essay was made on the first
day of June, eighteen hundred and fifteen. She proved herself capable of
opposing the wind, and of stemming the tide, of crossing currents, and
of being steered among vessels riding at anchor, though the weather was
boisterous and the water rough. Her performance demonstrated that the
project was successful&mdash;no doubt remained that a floating battery,
composed of heavy artillery, could be moved by steam. The Commissioners
returned from the exercise of the day, satisfied that the vessel would
answer the intended purpose, and consoled themselves that their care had
been bestowed upon a worthy object.

But it was discovered, that various alterations were necessary. Guided
by the light of experience, they caused some errors to be corrected, and
some defects to be supplied. She was prepared for a second voyage with
all practicable speed.

[175]

On the fourth of July she was again put in action. She performed a trip
to the ocean, eastward of Sandy Hook, and back again, a distance of
fifty-three miles, in eight hours and twenty minutes. A part of this
time she had the tide against her, and had no assistance whatever from
sails. Of the gentlemen who formed the company invited to witness the
experiment, not one entertained a doubt of her fitness for the intended
purpose.

Additional expedients were, notwithstanding, necessary to be sought for
quickening and directing her motion. These were devised and executed
with all possible care.

Suitable arrangements having been made, a third trial of her powers was
attempted on the eleventh day of September, with the weight of
twenty-six of her long and ponderous guns, and a considerable quantity
of ammunition and stores on board; her draft of water was short of
eleven feet. She changed her course by inverting the motion of the
wheel, without the necessity of putting about. She fired salutes as she
passed the forts, and she overcame the resistance of the wind and tide
in her progress down the bay. She performed beautiful man&oelig;uvres
around the United States&rsquo; Frigate Java, then at anchor near the
light-house. She moved with remarkable celerity, and she was perfectly
obedient to her double helm. It was observed that the explosion of
powder produced very little concussion. The machinery was not affected
by it in the smallest degree. Her progress, during the firing, was
steady and uninterrupted. On the most accurate calculations, derived
from heaving the log, her average velocity was five and a-half miles per
hour. Notwithstanding the resistance of currents, she was found to make
headway at the rate of two miles an hour against the ebb of the East
River, running three and a-half knots. The day&rsquo;s exercise was
satisfactory to the respectable company who attended, beyond their
utmost expectations. It was universally agreed that we now possessed a
new auxiliary against every maratime invader. The City of New York,
exposed as it is, was considered as having the means of rendering itself
invulnerable. The Delaware, Chesapeake, Long Island Sound, and every
other bay and harbor in the nation, may be protected by the same
tremendous power.

Among the inconveniences observable during the experiment, was the heat
endured by the men who attended the fires. To enable a correct judgment
to be formed on this point, one of the Commissioners (Dr. Mitchel)
descended and examined, by a thermometer, the temperature of the hold,
between the two boilers. The quicksilver, exposed to the radiant heat of
the burning fuel, rose to one hundred and sixteen degrees of
Fahrenheit&rsquo;s scale. Though exposed thus to its intensity, he experienced
no indisposition afterwards. The analogy of potteries, forges,
glass-houses, kitchens, and other places, where laborers are habitually
exposed to high heats, is familiar to persons of business and of
reflection. In all such occupations, the men, by proper relays, perform
their services perfectly well.

The Government, however, will understand that the hold of the present
vessel could be rendered cooler by other apertures for the admission of
air, and that on building another steam frigate, the comfort of the
firemen might be provided for, as in the ordinary steamboats.

The Commissioners congratulate the Government and the nation on the
event of this noble project. Honorable alike, to its author and its
patrons, it constitutes an era in warfare and the arts. The arrival of
peace, indeed, has disappointed the expectations of conducting her to
battle. That last and conclusive act of showing her superiority in
combat, has not been in the power of the Commissioners to make.

[176]

If a continuance of tranquillity should be our lot, and this steam
vessel of war be not required for the public defense, the nation may
rejoice that the fact we have ascertained is of incalculably greater
value than the expenditure&mdash;and that if the present structure should
perish, we have the information never to perish, how, on a future
emergency, others may be built. The requisite variations will be
dictated by circumstances.

Owing to the cessation of hostilities, it has been deemed inexpedient to
finish and equip her as for immediate and active employ. In a few weeks
every thing that is incomplete could receive the proper adjustment.

After so much has been done, and with such encouraging results, it
becomes the Commissioners to recommend that the steam frigate be
officered and manned for discipline and practice. A discreet commander,
with a selected crew, could acquire experience in the mode of navigating
this peculiar vessel. The supplies of fuel, the tending of the fire, the
replenishing of the expended water, the management of the mechanism, the
heating of shot, the exercise of the guns, and various matters, can only
become familiar by use. It is highly important that a portion of seamen
and marines should be versed in the order and economy of the steam
frigate. They will augment, diffuse, and perpetuate knowledge. When, in
process of time, another war shall call for more structures of this
kind, men, regularly trained to her tactics, may be dispatched to the
several stations where they may be wanted. If, on any such disposition,
the Government should desire a good and faithful agent, the
Commissioners recommend Captain Obed Smith to notice, as a person who
has ably performed the duties of inspector from the beginning to the end
of the concern.

Annexed to the report, you will find, Sir, several statements
explanatory of the subject. A separate report of our colleague, the
honorable Oliver Wolcott, whose removal from New York precluded him from
attending to the latter part of the business, with his accustomed zeal
and fidelity, is herewith presented. A drawing of her form and
appearance, by Mr. Morgan, as being like to give satisfaction to the
department, is also subjoined, as are likewise an inventory of her
furniture and effects, and an account of the timber and metals
consolidated in her fabric.

It is hoped these communications will evince the pains taken by the
Commissioners, to execute the honorable and responsible trust reposed in
them by the Government.

HISTORY OF PHOSPHORUS


The &ldquo;cold light&rdquo; produced by phosphorus caused it to be
considered a miraculous chemical for a long time after its
discovery, about 1669. During the intervening three centuries
numerous other chemical miracles have been found, yet
phosphorus retains a special aura of universal importance in
chemistry. Many investigators have occupied themselves with
this element and its diverse chemical compounds. Further
enlightenment and insight into the ways of nature can be
expected from these efforts.

Not only is the story of phosphorus a major drama in the
history of chemistry; it also illustrates, in a spectacular
example, the growth of this science through the discovery of
connections between apparently unrelated phenomena, and the
continuous interplay between basic science and the search for
practical usage.

The Author: Eduard Farber is a research professor at American
University, Washington, D.C., and has been associated with the
Smithsonian Institution as a consultant in chemistry.



When phosphorus was discovered, nearly three centuries ago, it was
considered a miraculous thing. The only event that provoked a similar
emotion was the discovery of radium more than two centuries later. The
excitement about the Phosphorus igneus, Boyle&rsquo;s Icy Noctiluca, was
slowly replaced by, or converted into, chemical research. Yet, if we
would allow room for emotion in research, we could still be excited
about the wondrous substance that chemical and biological work continues
to reveal as vitally important. It is a fundamental plant nutrient, an
essential part in nerve and brain substance, a decisive factor in muscle
action and cell growth, and also a component in fast-acting, powerful
poisons. The importance of phosphorus was gradually recognized and the
means by which this took place are characteristic and similar to other
developments in the history of science. This paper was written in order
to summarize these various means which led to the highly complex ways of
present research.




The Element from Animals and Plants

It was a little late to search for the philosophers&rsquo; stone in 1669, yet
it was in such a search that phosphorus was discovered. Wilhelm Homberg
(1652-1715) described it in the following manner: Brand,
[179]
&ldquo;a man little
known, of low birth, with a bizarre and mysterious nature in all he
did, found this luminous matter while searching for something else. He
was a glassmaker by profession, but he had abandoned it in order to be
free for the pursuit of the philosophical stone with which he was
engrossed. Having put it into his mind that the secret of the
philosophical stone consisted in the preparation of urine, this man
worked in all kinds of manners and for a very long time without finding
anything. Finally, in the year 1669, after a strong distillation of
urine, he found in the recipient a luminant matter that has since been
called phosphorus. He showed it to some of his friends, among them
Mister Kunkel [sic].&rdquo;[1]

Neither the name nor the phenomenon were really new. Organic
phosphorescent materials were known to Aristotle, and a lithophosphorus
was the subject of a book published in 1640, based on a discovery made
by a shoemaker, Vicenzo Casciarolo, on a mountain-side near Bologna in
1630.[2] Was the substance new which Brand showed to his friends? Johann
Gottfried Leonhardi quotes a book of 1689 in which the author, Kletwich,
claims that this phosphorus had already been known to Fernelius, the
court physician of King Henri II of France (1154-1189).[3] To the same
period belongs the &ldquo;Ordinatio Alchid Bechil Saraceni philosophi,&rdquo; in
which Ferdinand Hoefer found a distillation of urine with clay and
carbonaceous material described, and the resulting product named
escarbuncle.[4] It would be worth looking for this source; although
Bechil would still remain an entirely unsuccessful predecessor, it does
seem strange that in all the distillations of arbitrary mixtures, the
conditions should never before 1669 have been right for the formation
and the observation of phosphorus.




Figure 1.&mdash;The alchemist discovers phosphorus. A painting
by Joseph Wright (1734-1779) of Derby, England.


For Brand&rsquo;s contemporaries at least, the discovery was new and exciting.
The philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716) considered it
important enough to devote some of his time (between his work as
librarian in Hanover and WolfenbÃ¼ttel, his efforts to reunite the
Protestant and the Catholic churches, and his duties as Privy Councellor
in what we would call a Department of Justice) to a history of
phosphorus. This friend of Huygens and Boyle tried to prove that Kunckel
was not justified in claiming the discovery for himself.[5] Since then,
it has been shown that Johann Kunckel (1630-1703) actually worked out
the method which neither Brand nor his friend Kraft wanted to disclose.
Boyle also developed a method independently, published it, and
instructed
[180]
Gottfried Hankwitz in the technique. Later on, Jean Hellot
(1685-1765) gave a meticulous description of the details and a long
survey of the literature.
[6]




Figure 2.&mdash;Galley-oven, 1869. The picture is a cross
section through the front of the oven showing one of the 36 retorts, the
receivers for the distillate, and the space in the upper story used for
evaporating the mixture of acid solution of calcium phosphate and coal.
(According to Anselme Payen, PrÃ©cis de Chimie industrielle, Paris,
1849; reproduced from Hugo Fleck, Die Fabrikation chemischer Produkte
aus thierischen AbfÃ¤llen, Vieweg, Braunschweig, 1862, page 80 of volume
2, 2nd group, of P. Bolley&rsquo;s Handbuch der chemischen Technologie.)


To obtain phosphorus, a good proportion of coal (regarded as a type of
phlogiston) was added to urine, previously thickened by evaporation and
preferably after putrefaction, and the mixture was heated to the highest
attainable temperature. It was obvious that phlogiston entered into the
composition of the distillation product. The question remained whether
this product was generated de novo. In his research of 1743 to 1746,
Andreas Sigismund Marggraf (1709-1782) provided the answer. He found the
new substance in edible plant seeds, and he concluded that it enters the
human system through the plant food, to be excreted later in the urine.
He did not convince all the chemists with his reasoning. In 1789,
Macquer wrote: &ldquo;There are some who, even at this time, hold that the
phosphorical (&lsquo;phosphorische&rsquo;) acid generates itself in the animals and
who consider this to be the &lsquo;animalistic
acid.&rsquo;&rdquo;[7]

Although Marggraf was more advanced in his arguments than these
chemists, yet he was a child of his time. The luminescent and
combustible, almost wax-like substance impressed him greatly. &ldquo;My
thoughts about the unexpected generation of light and fire out of water,
fine earth, and phlogiston I reserve to describe at a later time.&rdquo; These
thoughts went so far as to connect the new marvel with alchemical wonder
tales. When Marggraf used the &ldquo;essential salt of urine,&rdquo; also called
sal microcosmicum, and admixed silver chloride (&ldquo;horny silver&rdquo;) to it
for the distillation of phosphorus, he expected &ldquo;a partial conversion of
silver by phlogiston and the added fine vitrifiable earth, but no trace
of a more noble metal
appeared.&rdquo;
[8]

Robert Boyle had already found that the burning of phosphorus produced
an acid. He identified it by taste and by its influence on colored plant
extracts serving as &ldquo;indicators.&rdquo;
Hankwitz
[9] described methods for
obtaining this acid, and Marggraf showed its chemical peculiarities.
They did not necessarily establish phosphorus as a new element. To do
that was not as important, at that time, as to conjecture on analogies
with known substances. Underlying all its unique characteristics was the
analogy of phosphorus with sulfur. Like sulfur, phosphorus can burn in
two different ways, either slowly or more violently, and form two
different acids. The analogy can, therefore, be extended to explain the
results in both groups in the same way. In the process of burning, the
combustible component is removed, and the acid originally combined with
the combustible is set free. Whether the analogy should be pursued even
further remained doubtful, although some suspicion lingered on for a
while that phosphoric acid might actually be a modified sulfuric acid.
Analogies and suspicions like these were needed to formulate new
questions and stimulate new experiments. They are cited here for their
important positive value in the historical development, and not for the
purpose of showing how wrong these chemists were from our
[181]
point of view, a point of view which they helped to create.

The widespread interest in the burning of sulfur and of phosphorus,
naturally, caught Lavoisier&rsquo;s attention. In his first volume of
Opuscules Physiques et Chimiques (1774), he devoted 20 pages to his
experiments on phosphorus. He amplified them a few years
later
[10] when
he attributed the combustion to a combination of phosphorus with the
&ldquo;eminently respirable&rdquo; part of air. In the MÃ©thode de Nomenclature
Chimique of 1787, the column of &ldquo;undecomposed substances&rdquo; lists sulfur
as the &ldquo;radical sulfurique,&rdquo; and phosphorus, correspondingly, as the
&ldquo;radical phosphorique.&rdquo; The acids are now shown to be compounds of the
&ldquo;undecomposed&rdquo; radicals, the complete reversion of the previous concept
of this relationship. A part of the old analogy remained as far as the
acids are concerned: sulfuric acid corresponds to phosphoric; sulfurous
acid to phosphorous acid with less oxygen than in the
former.
[11]




Early Uses

In the 18th century, phosphorus was a costly material. It was produced
mostly for display and to satisfy curiosity. Guillaume FranÃ§ois Rouelle
(1703-1770) demonstrated the process in his lectures, and, as Macquer
reports, he &ldquo;very often&rdquo; succeeded in making
it.
[12] Robert Boyle had
the idea of using phosphorus as a light for underwater
divers.
[13] A
century later, &ldquo;instant lights&rdquo; were sold, with molten phosphorus as the
&ldquo;igniter,&rdquo; but they proved cumbersome and
unreliable.
[14] Because white
phosphorus is highly poisonous, an active development of the use in
matches occurred only after the conversion of the white modification
into the red had been studied by Ãmile Kopp (1844), by Wilhelm Hittorf
(1824-1914) and, in its practical application, by Anton SchrÃ¶tter
(1802-1875).
[15]




Figure 3.&mdash;Distillation apparatus (1849) for refining
crude phosphorus. The crude phosphorus is mixed with sand under hot
water, cooled, drained, and filled into the retort. The outlet of the
retort, at least 6 cm. in diameter, is partially immersed in the water
contained in the bucket. A small dish, made from lead, with an iron
handle, receives the distilled phosphorus. (From Hugo Fleck, Die
Fabrikation chemischer Produkte &#8230; page 90.)


The most exciting early use, however, was in medicine. It is not
surprising that such a use was sought at that time. Any new material
immediately became the hope of ailing mankind&mdash;and of striving
inventors.
[16]
Phosphorus was prescribed, in liniments with fatty oils
or as solution in alcohol and ether, for external and internal
application. A certain Dr. Kramer found it efficient against epilepsy
and melancholia (1730). A Professor Hartmann recommended it against
cramps.
[17] However, in the growing
[182]
production of phosphorus for
matches, the workers experienced the poisonous effects. In the plant of
Black and Bell at Stratford, this was prevented by inhaling turpentine.
Experiments on dogs were carried out to show that poisoning by
phosphorus could be remedied through oil of
turpentine.
[18]

a metal bath (b). Vessel (j) is filled with mercury and water; together
with valve (k), it serves as a safety device. The alcohol lamp (l) keeps
the tube warm against clogging by solidified vapors. Because of hydrogen
phosphides, the operation, carried out at 260&deg; C., had to be watched
very carefully. (According to Arthur Albright, 1851; reproduced from
Hugo Fleck, Die Fabrikation chemischer Produkte &#8230;, page 112.)





Chemical Constitution of Phosphoric Acids

In a long article on phosphorus, Edmond Willm wrote in 1876: &ldquo;For a
century, urine was the only source from which phosphorus was obtained.
After Gahn, in 1769, recognized the presence of phosphoric acid in
bones, Scheele indicated the procedure for making phosphorus from
them.&rdquo;[19]
Actually, Gahn used at first hartshorn (Cornu cervi
ustum), and Scheele doubted, until he checked it himself, that his
esteemed friend was right. A few years later, Scheele corrected Gahn&rsquo;s
assumption that the sal microcosmicum was an ammonia salt; instead, it
is &ldquo;a tertiary neutral salt, consisting of alkali mineralifixo (i.e.,
sodium), alkali volatili, and acido phosphori.&rdquo;
[20]

In the years after 1770, phosphorus was discovered in bones and many
other parts of various animals. Treatment with sulfuric acid decomposed
these materials into a solid residue and dissolved phosphoric acid. Many
salts of this acid were produced in crystalline form. Heat resistance
had been considered one of the outstanding characteristics of phosphoric
acid. Now, however, in the processes of drying and heating certain
phosphates, it became clear that three kinds of phosphoric acids could
be produced: ortho, pyro, and meta.

Berzelius cited these acids as examples of compounds which are
ISOMERIC.
This word was intended to designate compounds which contain the same
number of atoms of the same elements but combined in different manners,
thereby explaining their different chemical properties and crystal
forms. It was in 1830 that Berzelius propounded this companion of the
concept, ISOMORPHISM, which was to collect all cases of equal crystal
form in compounds in which equal numbers of atoms of different elements
are put together in the same manner. Together, the two concepts of
isomerism and isomorphism seemed to cover all the known exceptions from
the simplest assumption as to specificity and chemical composition.

However, only a few years later Thomas Graham (1805-1869) proved that
the three phosphoric acids are not isomeric. He used the proportion of 2
P to 5 O in the oxide which Berzelius had thought justified at least
until &ldquo;an example of the contrary could be sufficiently
established.&rdquo;[21] Refining the techniques of Gay-Lussac (1816) and
several other investigators, Graham characterized the three phosphoric
acids as &ldquo;a terphosphate, a biphosphate, and phosphate of water.&rdquo;
Actually, this was the wrong terminology for what he meant and
formulated as trihydrate, bihydrate, and monohydrate of phosphorus
oxide. In
[183]
his manner of writing the formulas, each dot over the symbol
for the element was to indicate an atom of oxygen; thus, he wrote:





  &#8230;

The fresh bones are thrown in at the top of the oven, B. First, fuel in
chamber F is lighted, and a certain quantity of bones is burnt on the

with bones, and the combustion maintains itself without addition of
other fuel. A circular gallery, C, surrounds the bottom of the oven and
carries the products of combustion into the chimney, H. The calcined
bones are taken out at the lower opening, G, by removing the bars of

l&rsquo;industrie, volume 3, 1874, page 537.)

Carroll D. Wright, The Phosphate Industry of the United States, sixth
special report of the Commissioner of Labor, Government Printing Office,
Washington, 1893, plate facing page 43.)


Graham had come to this understanding of the phosphoric acids through
his previous studies of &ldquo;Alcoates, definite compounds of Salts and
Alcohol analogous to the Hydrates&rdquo; (1831). Liebig started from analogies
he saw with certain organic acids when he formulated the phosphoric
acids with a constant proportion of water (aq.) and varying proportions
of &ldquo;phosphoric acid&rdquo; (P) as follows:

[185]

2 P 3 aq. phosphoric acid
3 P 3 aq. pyrophosphoric acid
6 P 3 aq. metaphosphoric acid.

Salts are formed when a &ldquo;basis,&rdquo; i.e., a metal oxide, replaces water.
When potassium-acid sulfate is neutralized by sodium base, the acid-salt
divides into Glauber&rsquo;s salt and potassium sulfate, which proves the
acid-salt to be a mixture of the neutral salt with its acid. Sodium-acid
phosphate behaves quite differently. After neutralization by a potassium
&ldquo;base&rdquo; (hydroxide), the salt does not split up; a uniform
sodium-potassium phosphate is obtained. Therefore, phosphoric acid is
truly three-basic![23]


This result has later been confirmed, but the analogy by means of which
it had been obtained was very weak, in certain parts quite wrong.

The acids from the two lower oxides of phosphorus were also considered
as three-basic. Adolphe Wurtz (1817-1884) formulated them in 1846,
according to the theory of chemical types:

(PO) &middot; &middot; &middot;
O3 &nbsp; &nbsp; phosphoric acid
H3

(PHO) &middot; &middot;
O2 &nbsp; &nbsp; phosphorus acid
H2

(PH2O) &middot;
O &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hypophosphorous acid.[24]
H


Further proof for these constitutions was sought in the study of the
esters formed when the acids react with alcohols.

Among the analogies and generalizations by which the research on
phosphoric acid was supported, and to the results of which it
contributed a full share, was the new theory of acids. Not oxygen,
Lavoisier&rsquo;s general acidifier, but reactive hydrogen determines the
character of acids. In this brief survey, it seems sufficient just to
mention this connection without describing it in detail.

The study of phosphoric acids led to important new concepts in
theoretical chemistry. The finding of polybasicity was extended to other
acids and formed the model that helped to recognize the
polyfunctionality in other compounds, like alcohols and amines. The
hydrogen theory of acids was fundamental for further advance. In another
dimension, it is particularly interesting to see that large-scale
applications followed almost immediately and directly from the new
theoretical insight. The first and foremost of these applications was in
agriculture.





Phosphates as Plant Nutrients


One hundred years after the discovery of &ldquo;cold light,&rdquo; the presence of
phosphorus in plants and animals was ascertained, and its form was
established as a compound of phosphoric acid. This knowledge had little
practical effect until the &ldquo;nature&rdquo; of the acid, in its various forms,
was explained through the work of Thomas Graham. From it, there started
a considerable technical development.

At about that time (1833), the Duke of Richmond proved that the
fertilizing value of bones resided not in the gelatin, nor in the
calcium, but in the phosphoric acid. Thus, he confirmed what ThÃ©odore de
Saussure had said in 1804, that &ldquo;we have no reason to believe&rdquo; that
plants can exist without phosphorus. Unknowingly at first, the farmer
had supplied this element by means of the organic fertilizers he used:
manure, excrements, bones, and horns. Now, with the value of phosphorus
known, a search began for mineral phosphates to be applied as
fertilizers. Jean Baptiste Boussingault (1802-1887), an agricultural
chemist in Lyons, traveled to Peru to see the guano deposits. Garcilaso
de la Vega (ca. 1540 to ca. 1616) noted in his history of Peru (1604)
that guano was used by the Incas as a fertilizer. Two hundred years
later, Alexander von Humboldt revived this knowledge, and Humphry Davy
wrote about the benefits of guano to the soil. Yet, the application of
this fertilizer developed only slowly, until Justus Liebig sang its
praise. Imports into England rose and far exceeded those into France
where, between 1857 and 1867, about 50,000 tons were annually received.

The other great advance in the use of phosphatic plant nutrients started
with Liebig&rsquo;s recommendation (1840) to treat bones with sulfuric acid
for solubilization. This idea was not entirely new; since 1832, a
production of a &ldquo;superphosphate&rdquo; from bones and sulfuric acid had been
in progress at Prague. At[186] Rothamsted in 1842, John Bennet Lawes
obtained a patent on the manufacture of superphosphate. Other
manufactures in England followed and were successful, although James
Muspratt (1793-1886) at Newton lost much time and &ldquo;some thousands of
pounds&rdquo; on Liebig&rsquo;s idea of a &ldquo;mineral manure.&rdquo;




Figure 8.&mdash;Florida land-pebble phosphate mining. (From
Carroll D. Wright, The Phosphate Industry of the United States &#8230;,
plate facing page 58.)


It was difficult enough to establish the efficacy of bones and
artificially produced phosphates in promoting the growth of plants under
special conditions of soils and climate; therefore, the question as to
the action of phosphates in the growing plant was not even seriously
formulated at that time. The beneficial effects were obvious enough to
increase the use of phosphates as plant nutrients and to call for new
sources of supply. Active developments of phosphate mining and treating
started in South Carolina in 1867, and in Florida in 1888.[25]

In a reciprocal action, more phosphate application to soils stimulated
increasing research on the conditions and reactions obtaining in the
complex and varying compositions called soil. The findings of
bacteriologists made it clear that physics and chemistry had to be
amplified by biology for a real understanding of fertilizer effects.
After 1900, for example, Julius Stoklasa (1857-1936) pointed out that
bacterial action in soil solubilizes water-insoluble phosphates and
makes them available to the plants.[26]




Figure 9.&mdash;Florida river-pebble phosphate mining. (From
Carroll D. Wright, The Phosphate Industry of the United States &#8230;,
plate facing page 64.)


The insight into the importance of phosphorus in organisms, especially
since Liebig&rsquo;s time, is reflected in the work of Friedrich Nietzsche
(1844-1900). This &ldquo;re-valuator of all values&rdquo; who modestly said of
himself: &ldquo;I am dynamite!&rdquo; once explained the human temperaments as
caused by the inorganic salts they contain: [187]&ldquo;The differences in
temperament are perhaps caused more by the different distribution and
quantities of the inorganic salts than by everything else. Bilious
people have too little sodium sulfate, the melancholics are lacking in
potassium sulfate and phosphate; too little calcium phosphate in the
phlegmatics. Courageous natures have an excess of iron phosphate.&rdquo; (See
volume 12 of Nietzsche&rsquo;s Works, edit. Naumann-KrÃ¶ner, Leipzig, 1886.)
In this strange association of inorganic salts with human temperaments,
the role of iron phosphate as a producer of courage is particularly
interesting. What would a modern philosopher conclude if he followed the
development of insight into the composition and function of complex
phosphate compounds in organisms?





From Inorganic to Organic Phosphates


By the middle of the 19th century, the source of phosphorus in natural
phosphates and the chemistry of its oxidation products had been
established. The main difficulty that had to be overcome was that these
oxidation products existed in so many forms, not only several stages of
oxidation, but, in addition, aggregations and condensations of the
phosphoric acids. Once the fundamental chemistry of these acids was
elucidated, the attention of chemists and physiologists turned to the
task of finding the actual state in which phosphorus compounds were
present in the organisms. It had been a great advance when it had been
shown that plants need phosphates in their soil. This led to the next
question concerning the materials in the body of the plant for which
phosphates were being used and into which they were incorporated.
Similarly, the knowledge that animals attain their phosphates from the
digested plant food called, in the next step of scientific inquiry, for
information on the nature of phosphates produced from this source.

The method used in this inquiry was to subject anatomically separated
parts of the organisms to chemical separations. The means for such
separations had to be more gentle than the strong heat and destructive
chemicals that had been considered adequate up to then. The
interpretation of the new results naturally relied on the general
advance of chemistry, the development of new methods for isolating
substances of little stability, of new concepts concerning the
arrangements of atoms in the molecules, and of new apparatus to measure
their rates of change.

Figure 10.&mdash;Electric
furnace for producing elemental phosphorus, invented by
Thomas Parker of Newbridge, England, and
assigned to The Electric Construction Corporation of the same place. The
drawing is part of United States patent 482,586 (September 13, 1892).
The furnace was patented in England on October 29, 1889 (no. 17,060); in
France on June 23, 1890 (no. 206,566); in Germany on June 17, 1890 (no.

explanation is cited from the U.S. patent:


Figure 1 [shown here] is a vertical section of the furnace, and Fig. 2
is a diagram to illustrate the means for regulating the electro-motive
force or quantity of current across the furnace.

F is the furnace containing the charge to be treated. It has an
inlet-hopper at a, with slides AA, by which the charge can be admitted
without opening communication between the interior of the furnace and
the outer air.

B is a screw conveyer by which the charge is pushed forward into the
furnace.

cÂ´cÂ´ are the electrodes, consisting of blocks or cylinders or the like
of carbon fixed in metal socket-pieces c c, to which the
electric-circuit wires d from the dynamo D are affixed. The current,
as aforesaid, may be either continuous or alternating. c2c2 are
rods of metal or carbon, which are used to establish the electric
circuit through the furnace, the said rods being inserted into holes in
conductors c3 (in contact with the socket-pieces c) and in the
furnace, as shown.

g is the outlet for the gas or vapor, h the slag-tap hole, and x
the opening for manipulating the charge, the said openings being closed
by clay or otherwise when the furnace is at work.

I use coke or other form of carbon in the charge between the electrodes
cÂ´, the said coke being in contact with the said electrodes, so that
complete incandescence is insured.

A means for varying the electro-motive force or quantity of current
across the furnace with the varying resistance of the charge is
illustrated by the diagram, Fig. 2. cÂ´ c2 indicate the electrodes

resistance-switch, which is operated to put in more or less resistance
at R as the resistance of the charge in the furnace lessens or
increases. This switch may be automatically operated, and a suitable
arrangement for the purpose is a current-regulator such as is described
in the specification of English Letters Patent No. 14,504, of September
14, 1889, granted to William Henry Douglas and Thomas Hugh Parker.

12.5 manganese dioxide, 15 gelatin. According to Figuier (page 579), R.
Wagner substituted lead dioxide for the manganese dioxide. (From
Figuier, volume 3, 1874, page 576.)



In the system of chemistry, as it developed in the first half of the
19th century, the new development can be characterized as the turn from
inorganic to organic phosphates, from the substance of minerals and
strong chemical interactions to the components in which phosphate groups
remained combined with carbon-containing substances.





Phosphatides and Phosphagens


The important phosphorus compounds in organisms are much more complex
than the simple salts, to which Nietzsche attributed such influence on
man&rsquo;s character. Long before he wrote, it was known that phosphoric acid
combines not only with inorganic bases to form salts, but with alcohols
to form esters. In the middle of the 19th century, ThÃ©ophile Juste
Pelouze (1807-1867) extended this knowledge to an ester of glycerol.
This proved to be significant in several respects. Glycerol had been
shown by Michel Chevreul (1786-1889) as the substance in fats that is
released in the process of soap boiling, when the fatty acids are
converted into their salts. That it has the nature of an alcohol had
been demonstrated by Marcellin Berthelot. Instead of one &ldquo;alcoholic&rdquo;
hydroxyl group, OH, like ethanol (the alcohol of fermentation), or two
hydroxyl groups (like ethylene glycol), glycerol contains three such
groups. It was the only &ldquo;natural&rdquo; alcohol known at that time. That this
alcohol would combine with phosphoric acid could be predicted, but that
the ester, as obtained by Pelouze, still contained free acidic functions
and formed a water-soluble barium salt was a new experience.

[190]




Figure 13.&mdash;Survey of alcoholic fermentation, 1951. The
&ldquo;well-known scheme of alcoholic fermentation&rdquo; according to Albert Jan
Kluyver (1888-1956), presented before the Society of Chemical Industry
in the Royal Institution, March 7, 1951. In Chemistry &amp; Industry,
1952, page 136 ff., Kluyver restates that &ldquo;&#8230; the fermentation of one
molecule of glucose is indissolubly connected with the formation of two
molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) out of two molecules of
adenosine diphosphate (ADP).&rdquo;


[191]

Shortly after this experience had been gained, it became valuable for
understanding the chemical nature of a new substance extracted from a
natural organ. This substance was named lecithin by its discoverer,
Nicolas ThÃ©odore Gobley[27] (1811-1876), because he obtained it from egg
yolk (in Greek, lÃ©kidos). He used ether and alcohol for this
extraction. Had he used water and mineral acid instead, he would not
have found lecithin, but only its components. As Gobley and, slightly
later, Oscar Liebreich (1839-1908), subjected lecithin to treatment with
boiling water and acid, they separated it into three parts. One of them
was the glycerophosphoric acid of Pelouze, the second was the well-known
stearic acid of Chevreul, but the third was somewhat mysterious. This
third substance was the same as one previously noticed when nerves had
been subjected to an extraction by boiling water and acid and,
therefore, called nerve-substance or neurine. Adolf Friedrich Strecker
(1822-1871) established the identity of this neurine with a product he
had extracted from bile and which went under the name of choline.
Adolphe Wurtz (1817-1884) succeeded in synthesizing this substance from
ethylene oxide, CH2.O.CH2 and trimethylamine N(CH3)3.[28] Thus, all
three parts were identified, and Strecker put them together to construct
a chemical formula for lecithin, glycerophosphoric acid combined with a
fatty acid and with choline (a hydrate of neurine).

Lecithin

according to Strecker



This formula was not quite correct. Richard WillstÃ¤tter showed that an
internal neutralization takes place between the amino group and the free
acidic residue. This is expressed in his lecithin formula of 1918.



Lecithin (1918)


When the aim was to distill elementary phosphorus out of an organic
material, it did not matter whether this was fresh or putrified. For
obtaining lecithin out of egg yolk and similar materials, it was
essential to use it in fresh condition. Otherwise, enzymes would have
decomposed it. Through more recent work, four enzymes have been
separated, which act specifically in decomposing lecithin. Enzyme A
removes one fatty acid and leaves a complex residue, called
lysolecithin, intact. Enzyme B attacks this residue and splits off the
remaining fatty acid group from it, enzyme C liberates only the choline
from lecithin, and enzyme D opens lecithin at the ester bond between
glycerol and phosphoric acid. This is shown in the following diagram.

D

Several fatty acids can be present in lecithin from various sources:
palmitic and oleic acid, besides the stearic acid which at first had
been thought the only one involved. In another group of extracts from
brain or nerve tissue, amino-ethanol H2NCH2CH2OH is found
instead of the choline of lecithin. The variations include the alcohol,
to which the fatty acids and choline phosphate are attached.
For example, glycerol can be replaced by the so-called meat-sugar, inositol,
which has six hydroxyl groups in its hexagon-shaped molecule
C6H6(OH)6.

[192]




Figure 14.&mdash;Eduard Buchner (1860-1917) received the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of cell-free fermentation, the
first step in finding the role of phosphate in fermentations (1907).


The generally similar behavior of these phosphate-and fat-containing
substances was emphasized by Ludwig Thudichum (1829-1901). He coined the
name phosphatides for this group of substances from seeds and
nerves.[29]
His work on the phosphates in brain substance aroused
particular interest. When William Crookes drew his highly imaginative
picture of an &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; of the chemical elements, he put into it
&ldquo;phosphorus for the brain, salt for the sea, clay for the solid
earth&#8230;.&rdquo;
[30] But 
phosphatides occur in many places of organisms, in
bacteria, in leaves and roots of plants, in fat and tissues of animals.
And where phosphatides are found, there are also enzymes that
specifically act on them. They are called phosphatases to imply that
they split the phosphatides. In addition, enzymes are present, which
transfer phosphate groups from one compound to another. They are more
abundant in seeds of high fat content than in the more starch-containing
seeds, but even potatoes and orange juice have
phosphatases.
[31]

Thus, from phosphatides, phosphoric acid is generated, and they could
also be called phosphagens. Since 1926, however, the name phosphagens
has been reserved for a group of organic substances that release their
phosphoric acid very readily. The link between phosphorus and carbon is
provided by oxygen in the phosphatides, by nitrogen in the phosphagens.
In vertebrates, the basis for the phosphoric acid is creatine, whereas
invertebrates have arginine instead.




Creatine Phosphate



Arginine phosphate





Nuclein and Nucleic Acids


All parts of an organism are essential for life. Only with this in mind
does it make sense to say that the most important part of the cell is
its nucleus. From the nuclei of cells in pus and in salmon sperm, Johann
Friedrich Miescher (1811-1887) obtained a peculiar kind of substance,
which he named nuclein (1868). Its phosphate content was easily
discovered, but to find the exact proportions and the nature of the
other components required special methods of separation from
phosphatides and other proteins. It was difficult to develop such
methods at a time when little was known about the properties, and
particularly[193] the stability, of a nuclein. For preparing nuclein from
yeast cells, Felix Hoppe-Seyler (1825-1895) described the following
details: Yeast is dispersed in water to extract soluble materials, like
salts or sugars. After a few hours, the insoluble material is separated,
washed once more with water, and then extracted with a very dilute
solution of sodium hydroxide. The slightly alkaline solution, freed from
insoluble residues, is slowly added to a weak hydrochloric acid. A
precipitate forms which is separated by filtration, washed with dilute
acid, then with cold alcohol, and finally extracted by boiling alcohol.
The dried residue is the nuclein.[32] It contains six percent
phosphorus. A little more washing with water, a slightly longer
treatment with acid or alcohol gives products of lower phosphorus
content. Many experimental variations were necessary to establish the
procedure that leads to purification without alteration of the natural
substance.

This was also true for the methods of chemical degradation, carried out
in order to find the components of nucleins in their highest state of
natural complexity. It was learned for example, that the special kind of
carbohydrate present in nucleins was very susceptible to change under
the conditions of hydrolysis by acids. Phoebus Aaron Theodor Levine
(1869-1940), therefore, used the digestion by a living organism. With E.
S. London, he introduced a solution of nucleic acid into, e.g., the
gastrointestinal segment of a dog through a gastric fistula and withdrew
the product of digestion through an intestinal fistula. Fortunately, the
products obtained in such degradations were not new in themselves. The
carbohydrate in this nucleic acid proved to be identical with D-ribose,
which Emil Fischer had artificially made from arabinose and named ribose
to indicate this relationship (1891). The nitrogenous products of the
degradation were identical with substances previously prepared in the
long study of uric acid. In the course of this study, Emil Fischer
established uric acid and a number of its derivatives as having the
elementary skeleton of what he called &ldquo;pure uric acid,&rdquo; abbreviated to
purine. Out of Adolf Baeyer&rsquo;s work on barbituric acid came the knowledge
of pyrimidine and its derivatives.

Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1910 for his work on nucleic
substances, which contain a high proportion of phosphorus. The chemical
bonds of this phosphorus in the molecules of nucleic substances were
determined in later work. (Photo courtesy National Library of Medicine,

From these findings, together with what Oswald Schmiedeberg (1838-1921)
had established concerning the presence of four phosphate groups in the
molecule (1899), Robert Feulgen (1884-1955) constructed the following
scheme of a nucleic acid. Feulgen&rsquo;s formula of 1918 is:

Phosphoric acid&mdash;Carbohydrate&mdash;Guanine
Phosphoric acid&mdash;Carbohydrate&mdash;Cytosine
Phosphoric acid&mdash;Carbohydrate&mdash;Thymine
Phosphoric acid&mdash;Carbohydrate&mdash;Adenine


Of the four basic components on the right, thymine occurs in the
nucleic
acid from the thymus gland. Yeast contains uracil instead. The
difference between these two bases is one methyl group: thymine is a
5-methyluracil. In all of these basic substances, the structure of urea

is involved, and they form pairs of oxidized and reduced states:

The exact position of phosphoric acid was established after long work
and verified by synthesis.[33]

A compound of adenine, ribose, and phosphoric acid was found in yeast,
blood, and in skeletal muscle of mammals. From 100 grams of such muscle,
0.35-0.40 grams of this compound were isolated. If the muscle is at
rest, the compound contains three molecules of phosphoric acid, linked
through oxygen atoms. It was named adenosine triphosphate or
adenyltriphosphoric acid,[34] usually abbreviated by the symbol ATP. It
releases one phosphoric acid group very easily and goes over in the
diphosphate, ADP, but it can also lose 2 P-groups as pyrophosphoric acid
and leave the monophosphate, AMP.





This change of ATP was considered to be the main source of energy in
muscle contraction by Otto Meyerhof.[35] The corresponding derivatives
of guanine, cytosine, and uracil were also found, and they are active in
the temporary transfer of phosphoric acid groups in biological
processes.

Thus, the study of organic phosphates progressed from the comparatively
simple esters connected with fatty substances of organisms to the
proteins and the nuclear substances of the cell. The proportional amount
of phosphorus in the former was larger than in the latter; the actual
importance and function in the life of organisms, however, is not
measured by the quantity but determined by the special nature of the
compounds.

fermentation. He found coenzyme A which is a nucleotide containing
phosphoric acid.

of this study, they identified glucose 1-phosphate, now usually referred
to as &ldquo;Cori ester,&rdquo; and its function in the glycogen cycle. (Photo

[197]

The study of this function is the newest phase in the history of
phosphorus and represents the culmination of the previous efforts. This
newest phase developed out of an accidental discovery concerning one of
the oldest organic-chemical industries, the production of alcohol by the
fermentative action of yeast on sugar. A transition of carbohydrates
through phosphate compounds to the end products of the fermentation
process was found, and it gradually proved to be a kind of model for a
host of biological processes.

Specific phosphates were thus found to be indispensable for life. In
reverse, the wrong kind of phosphates can destroy life. As a result, an
important part of the new phase in phosphorus history consisted in the
study&mdash;and use&mdash;of antibiotic phosphorus compounds.





Phosphates in Biological Processes


The first indication that phosphorus is important for life came from the
experience that plants take it up from the substances in the soil. They
incorporate it in their body substance. What makes phosphorus so
important that they cannot grow without it? The next insight was that
animals acquire it from their plant food. It is then found in bones, in
fat and nerve tissue, in all cells and particularly in the cell nuclei.
What are its functions there?

The answers to such questions were developed from the study of a
long-known process, the conversion of carbohydrates into carbon dioxide
and alcohol by yeast. It started with Eduard Buchner&rsquo;s discovery of
1890, that fermentation is produced by a preparation from yeast in which
all living cells have been removed. When yeast is dead-ground and
pressed out, the juice still has the ability to produce fermentation.

It is strange, but in many ways characteristic for the process of
science, that the &ldquo;riddle&rdquo; of phosphorus in life was solved by first
eliminating life. In such &ldquo;lifeless&rdquo; fermentations, Arthur Harden found
that the conversion of sugar begins with the formation of a hexose
phosphate (1904). The &ldquo;ferment&rdquo; of yeast, called zymase, proved to be a
composite of several enzymes. Hans von Euler-Chelpin isolated one part
of zymase, which remains active even after heating its solution to the
boiling point. From 1 kilogram of yeast, he obtained 20 milligrams of
this heat-stable enzyme, which he called cozymase and identified as a
nucleotide composed of a purine, a sugar, and phosphoric acid.[36] In
the years between the two World Wars, zymase was further resolved into
more enzymes, one of them the coenzyme I, which was shown to be ADP
connected with another molecule of ribose attached to the amide of
nicotinic acid, or diphosphopyridine nucleotide:





[198]





Figure 20.&mdash;Fritz A. Lipmann (b. 1899) shared with Hans
Adolf Krebs the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1953 for his
work on coenzyme A. He discovered acetyl phosphate as the substance in
bacteria, which transfers phosphate to adenylic acid.





Figure 21.&mdash;Alexander R. Todd (b. 1907) received the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1957 for his research on nucleotides. He
determined the position of the phosphate groups in the molecule and
confirmed it by synthesis of dinucleotide phosphates.



Its function is connected with the transfer of hydrogen between
intermediates formed through phosphate-transferring enzymes.
Fermentation proceeds by a cascade of processes, in which phosphate
groups swing back and forth, and equilibria between ATP with ADP play a
major role.

Many of the enzymes are closely related to vitamins. Thus, cocarboxylase
A, which takes part in the separation of carbon dioxide from an
intermediate fermentation product, is the phosphate of vitamin B1.
Others of the B vitamins contain phosphate groups, for example those of
the B2 and B6 group, and in B12, one lonely phosphate forms a
bridge in the large molecule that contains one atom of cobalt:
C63H90N14O14PCo. The formation of vitamin A from carotine
occurs under the influence of ATP.

The first stages in fermentation are like those in respiration, which
ends with carbon dioxide and water. These two are the materials for the
reverse process in photosynthesis. When light is absorbed by the
chlorophyll of green plants, one of the initial reactions is a transfer
of hydrogen from water to a triphosphopyridine nucleotide, which later
acts to reduce the carbon dioxide. Under the influence of ATP,
phosphoglyceric acid is synthesized and further built up by way of
carbohydrate phosphates to hexose sugars and finally to starch. In many
starchy fruits, a small proportion of phosphate remains attached to the
end product.

The synthesis of proteins is under the control of deoxyribonucleic acid
or ribonucleic acid, abbreviated by the symbols DNA and RNA. The genes
in the nucleus are parts of a giant DNA molecule. RNA is a universal
constituent of all living cells. Where protein synthesis is intense, the
content in RNA is high. Thus, the spinning glands of silkworms are
extraordinarily rich in RNA.[37]

In his research on the radioactive isotope P32, George de Hevesy gained
some insight into the surprising mobility of phosphates in organisms: &ldquo;A
phosphate radical taken up with the food may first participate in the
phosphorylation of glucose in the intestinal mucose, soon afterwards
pass into the circulation as free phosphate, enter a red corpuscle,
become incorporated with an adenosine triphosphoric-acid molecule,
participate in a glycolytic process going on in the corpuscle, return to
circulation, penetrate into the liver cells, participate in the
formation of a phosphatide molecule, after a short interval enter the
circulation in this form, penetrate into the spleen, and leave this
organ after some time as a constituent of a lymphocyte. We may meet the
phosphate radical again as a constituent of the plasma, from which it
may find its way into the skeleton.&rdquo;[38] Much has been added in the last
30 years to complete this picture in many details and to extend it to
other biochemical processes, including even the changes of the pigments
in the retina in the visual process, or in the conversion of chemical
energy to light by bacteria and insects.





Medicines and Poisons


In the delicate balance of these processes, disturbances may occur which
can be remedied by specific phosphate-containing medicines. Thus,
adenosine phosphate has been recommended in cases of angina
[199] pectoris
and marketed under trade names like sarkolyt, or in compounds named
angiolysine. A considerable number of physiologically active organic
phosphates can be found in the patent literature.[39] Yeast itself is
considered to be a valuable food additive.

On the other hand, there are phosphate compounds that act as poisons.
One group of such compounds was discovered in 1929 by W. Lange, who
wrote: &ldquo;Of interest is the strong action of mono-fluorophosphate esters
on the human body&mdash;the effect is produced by very small quantities.&rdquo;[40]
Diisopropyl fluorophosphate has since become a potential agent for
chemical warfare. It inactivates an enzyme which controls the
transmission of nerve impulses to muscle,
acetylcholine esterase.

Organic esters of phosphoric acids are used as insecticides. The
hexa-ethylester of tetraphosphoric acid, prepared by Gerhard Schrader by
heating triethylphosphate with phosphorus oxychloride,[41] actually
contains tetraethylpyrophosphate (TEPP) among others. Bayer&rsquo;s Dipterex,
the dimethyl ester of 2,2,2-trichloro-1-hydroxyethyl-phosphonate, has
been modified to dimethyl-2,2-dichlorovinyl-phosphate and is especially
active against the oriental fruit fly.[42]

Figure 22.&mdash;Arthur Kornberg (b. 1918) and Severo Ochoa
(b. 1905) shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1959.
Kornberg received it for research on the biological synthesis of
deoxyribonucleic acid. In particular, he found that four triphosphate
components and a small amount of the end product as a &ldquo;template&rdquo; had to
be present for the enzymatic synthesis. Ochoa received his share of the
prize for research in ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid. In
particular, Ochoa synthesized polyribonucleotides and used the
radioactive isotope, P32. The synthetic polyribonucleotides were
found to resemble the natural substances in all essentials.






Figure 23.&mdash;Melvin Calvin (b. 1911) received the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry in 1961 for his research in photosynthesis, in which
he specified the function of phosphoglyceric acid as an intermediate in
the synthesis of carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water by green
plants.


The story of phosphorus, which began 300 years ago, has acquired new
importance in this century. Many scientists have contributed to it: 13
of them have received Nobel Prizes for work directly bearing on the
chemical and biological importance of phosphorus compounds. In
chronological order, they are: Eduard Buchner, Albrecht Kossel, Otto
Meyerhof, Arthur Harden, Hans von Euler-Chelpin, George de
Hevesy, Carl
F. Cori, Gerty T. Cori, Fritz Lipmann, Lord Alexander Todd, Arthur
Kornberg, Severo Ochoa, and Melvin Calvin. The developers of industrial
production and commercial utilization of phosphate compounds have had
other rewards.

field

TUNNEL ENGINEERING&mdash;A MUSEUM TREATMENT


During the years from 1830 to 1900, extensive developments took
place in the field of tunneling, which today is an important,
firmly established branch of civil engineering. This paper offers
a picture of its growth from the historical standpoint, based on
a series of models constructed for the Hall of Civil Engineering
in the new Museum of History and Technology. The eight
models described highlight the fundamental advances which have
occurred between primitive man&rsquo;s first systematic use of fire for
excavating rock in mining, and the use in combination of compressed
air, an iron lining, and a movable shield in a subaqueous
tunnel at the end of the 19th century.

The Author: Robert M. Vogel is curator of heavy machinery
and civil engineering, in the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s Museum
of History and Technology.


 a name="Introduction"
id="Introduction">Introduction


With
few exceptions, civil engineering is a field
in which the ultimate goal is the assemblage of
materials into a useful structural form according to a
scientifically derived plan which is based on various
natural and man-imposed conditions. This is true
whether the result be, for example, a dam, a building,
a bridge, or even the fixed plant of a railroad. However,
one principal branch of the field is based upon
an entirely different concept. In the engineering of
tunnels the utility of the &ldquo;structure&rdquo; is derived not
from the bringing together of elements but from the
separation of one portion of naturally existing material
from another to permit passage through a former
barrier.

In tunneling hard, firm rock, this is practically
the entire compass of the work: breaking away the
rock from the mother mass, and, coincidently, removing
it from the workings. The opposite extreme
in conditions is met in the soft-ground tunnel, driven
through material incapable of supporting itself above
[204]
the tunnel opening. Here, the excavation of the
tunneled substance is of relatively small concern,
eclipsed by the problem of preventing the surrounding
material from collapsing into the bore.

In one other principal respect does tunnel engineering
differ widely from its collateral branches of
civil engineering. Few other physical undertakings
are approached with anything like the uncertainty
attending a tunnel work. This is even more true in
mountain tunnels, for which test borings frequently
cannot be made to determine the nature of the
material and the geologic conditions which will be
encountered.

The course of tunnel work is not subject to an overall
preliminary survey; the engineer is faced with not
only the inability to anticipate general contingencies
common to all engineering work, but with the peculiar
and often overwhelming unpredictability of the
very basis of his work.

Subaqueous and soft-ground work on the other
hand, while still subject to many indeterminates, is
now far more predictable than during its early history,
simply because the nature of the adverse condition
prevailing eventually was understood to be quite
predictable. The steady pressures of earth and water
to refill the excavated area are today overcome with
relative ease and consistency by the tunneler.

In tunneling as in no other branch of civil engineering
did empiricism so long resist the advance of scientific
theory; in no other did the &ldquo;practical engineer&rdquo;
remain to such an extent the key figure in establishing
the success or failure of a project. The Hoosac Tunnel,
after 25 years of legislative, financial, and technical
difficulties, in 1875 was finally driven to successful
completion only by the efforts of a group who, while
in the majority were trained civil engineers, were to
an even greater extent men of vast practical ability,
more at home in field than office.

DeWitt C. Haskin (see p. 234), during the inquest
that followed the death of a number of men in a
blowout of his pneumatically driven Hudson River
Tunnel in 1880, stated in his own defense: &ldquo;I am not
a scientific engineer, but a practical one &#8230; I know
nothing of mathematics; in my experience I have
grasped such matters as a whole; I believe that the
study of mathematics in that kind of work [tunneling]
has a tendency to dwarf the mind rather than enlighten
it&#8230;.&rdquo; An extreme attitude perhaps, and
one which by no means adds to Haskin&rsquo;s stature, but
a not unusual one in tunnel work at the time. It
would not of course be fair to imply that such men
as Herman Haupt, Brunel the elder, and Greathead
were not accomplished theoretical engineers. But it
was their innate ability to evaluate and control the
overlying physical conditions of the site and work that
made possible their significant contributions to the
development of tunnel engineering.

Tunneling remained largely independent of the
realm of mathematical analysis long after the time
when all but the most insignificant engineering works
were designed by that means. Thus, as structural
engineering has advanced as the result of a flow of
new theoretical concepts, new, improved, and strengthened
materials, and new methods of fastening, the
progress of tunnel engineering has been due more to
the continual refinement of constructional techniques.

A NEW HALL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING

In the Museum of History and Technology has
recently been established a Hall of Civil Engineering
[205]
in which the engineering of tunnels is comprehensively
treated from the historical standpoint&mdash;something
not previously done in an American museum.
The guiding precept of the exhibit has not been to
outline exhaustively the entire history of tunneling,
but rather to show the fundamental advances which
have occurred between primitive man&rsquo;s first systematic
use of fire for excavating rock in mining, and the use
in combination of compressed air, iron lining, and a
movable shield in a subaqueous tunnel at the end of
the 19th century. This termination date was selected
because it was during the period from about 1830 to
1900 that the most concentrated development took
place, and during which tunneling became a firmly
established and important branch of civil engineering
and indeed, of modern civilization. The techniques
of present-day tunneling are so fully related in current
writing that it was deemed far more useful to
devote the exhibit entirely to a segment of the field&rsquo;s
history which is less commonly treated.

The major advances, which have already been
spoken of as being ones of technique rather than
theory, devolve quite naturally into two basic classifications:
the one of supporting a mass of loose,
unstable, pressure-exerting material&mdash;soft-ground tunneling;
and the diametrically opposite problem of
separating rock from the basic mass when it is so
firm and solid that it can support its own overbearing
weight as an opening is forced through it&mdash;rock, or
hard-ground tunneling.

To exhibit the sequence in a thorough manner,
inviting and capable of easy and correct interpretation
by the nonprofessional viewer, models offered
the only logical means of presentation. Six tunnels
were selected, all driven in the 19th century. Each
represents either a fundamental, new concept of
tunneling technique, or an important, early application
of one. Models of these works form the basis of
the exhibit. No effort was made to restrict the work
to projects on American soil. This would, in fact, have
been quite impossible if an accurate picture of tunnel
technology was to be drawn; for as in virtually all
other areas of technology, the overall development in
this field has been international. The art of mining
was first developed highly in the Middle Ages in the
Germanic states; the tunnel shield was invented by
a Frenchman residing in England, and the use of
compressed air to exclude the water from subaqueous
tunnels was first introduced on a major work by an
American. In addition, the two main subdivisions,
rock and soft-ground tunneling, are each introduced
by a model not of an actual working, but of one
typifying early classical methods which were in use
for centuries until the comparatively recent development
of more efficient systems of earth support and
rock breaking. Particular attention is given to accuracy
of detail throughout the series of eight models;
original sources of descriptive and graphic information
were used in their construction wherever possible. In
all cases except the introductory model in the rock-tunneling
series, representing copper mining by early
civilizations, these sources were contemporary
accounts.

The plan to use a uniform scale of reduction
throughout, in order to facilitate the viewers&rsquo; interpretation,
unfortunately proved impractical, due to
the great difference in the amount of area to be
encompassed in different models, and the necessity
that the cases holding them be of uniform height. The
related models of the Broadway and Tower Subways
represent short sections of tunnels only 8 feet or so in
diameter enabling a relatively large scale, 11/2 inches
to the foot, to be used. Conversely, in order that the
model of Brunel&rsquo;s Thames Tunnel be most effective,
[206]
it was necessary to include one of the vertical terminal
shafts used in its construction. These were about 60
feet in depth, and thus the much smaller scale of
1/4 inch to the foot was used. This variation is not
as confusing as might be thought, for the human
figures in each model provide an immediate and
positive sense of proportion and scale.

Careful thought was devoted to the internal lighting
of the models, as this was one of the critical factors in
establishing, so far as is possible in a model, an
atmosphere convincingly representative of work
conducted solely by artificial light. Remarkable
realism was achieved by use of plastic rods to conduct
light to the tiny sources of tunnel illumination, such
as the candles on the miners&rsquo; hats in the Hoosac
Tunnel, and the gas lights in the Thames Tunnel.
No overscaled miniature bulbs, generally applied in
such cases, were used. At several points where the
general lighting within the tunnel proper has been
kept at a low level to simulate the natural atmosphere
of the work, hidden lamps can be operated by push-button
in order to bring out detail which otherwise
would be unseen.

The remainder of the material in the Museum&rsquo;s
tunneling section further extends the two major aspects
of tunneling. Space limitations did not permit
treatment of the many interesting ancillary matters
vital to tunnel engineering, such as the unique problems
of subterranean surveying, and the extreme
accuracy required in the triangulation and subsequent
guidance of the boring in long mountain tunnels;
nor the difficult problems of ventilating long workings,
both during driving and in service; nor the several
major methods developed through the years for
driving or constructing tunnels in other than the
conventional manner.

 a name="Rock_Tunneling"
id="Rock_Tunneling">Rock Tunneling

While the art of tunneling soft ground is of relatively
recent origin, that of rock tunneling is deeply
rooted in antiquity. However, the line of its development
is not absolutely direct, but is more
logically followed through a closely related branch
of technology&mdash;mining. The development of mining
techniques is a practically unbroken one, whereas
there appears little continuity or relationship between
the few works undertaken before about the 18th
century for passage through the earth.

The Egyptians were the first people in recorded
history to have driven openings, often of considerable
magnitude, through solid rock. As is true of all
major works of that nation, the capability of such
grand proportion was due solely to the inexhaustible
supply of human power and the casual evaluation of
life. The tombs and temples won from the rock
masses of the Nile Valley are monuments of perseverance
rather than technical skill. Neither the
Egyptians nor any other peoples before the Middle
Ages have left any consistent evidence that they were
able to pierce ground that would not support itself
above the opening as would firm rock. In Egypt
were established the methods of rock breaking that
were to remain classical until the first use of gun-powder
blasting in the 17th century which formed the
basis of the ensuing technology of mining.

Notwithstanding the religious motives which inspired
the earliest rock excavations, more constant and
universal throughout history has been the incentive
to obtain the useful and decorative minerals hidden
beneath the earth&rsquo;s surface. It was the miner who
developed the methods introduced by the early civilizations
to break rock away from the primary mass,
and who added the refinements of subterranean surveying
and ventilating, all of which were later to be
assimilated into the new art of driving tunnels of large
diameter. The connection is the more evident from
the fact that tunnelmen are still known as miners.


COPPER MINING, B.C.

Therefore, the first model of the sequence, reflecting
elemental rock-breaking techniques, depicts a hard-rock
copper mine (fig.&nbsp;1). Due to the absence of
specific information about such works during the
pre-Christian eras, this model is based on no particular
period or locale, but represents in a general way,
a mine in the Rio Tinto area of Spain where copper
[207]
has been extracted since at least 1000 B.C. Similar
workings existed in the Tirol as early as about 1600
B.C. Two means of breaking away the rock are
shown: to the left is the most primitive of all methods,
the hammer and chisel, which require no further
description. At the right side, the two figures are
shown utilizing the first rock-breaking method in
which a force beyond that of human muscles was
employed, the age-old &ldquo;fire-setting&rdquo; method. The
rock was thoroughly heated by a fierce fire built
against its face and then suddenly cooled by dashing
water against it. The thermal shock disintegrated the
rock or ore into bits easily removable by hand.

skip; pumps at far right. In the center, the
top bench is being drilled by a single column-mounted

scale. (Smithsonian photo 49260-N.)


The practice of this method below ground, of
course, produced a fearfully vitiated atmosphere. It
is difficult to imagine whether the smoke, the steam,
or the toxic fumes from the roasting ore was the more
distressing to the miners. Even when performed by
labor considered more or less expendable, the method
could be employed only where there was ventilation
of some sort: natural chimneys and convection currents
were the chief sources of air circulation. Despite
the drawbacks of the fire system, its simplicity and
efficacy weighed so heavily in its favor that its history
of use is unbroken almost to the present day. Fire
setting was of greatest importance during the years of
intensive mining in Europe before the advent of
explosive blasting, but its use in many remote areas
hardly slackened until the early 20th century because
of its low cost when compared to powder. For this
same reason, it did have limited application in actual
tunnel work until about 1900.

Direct handwork with pick, chisel and hammer, and
fire setting were the principal means of rock removal
for centuries. Although various wedging systems
were also in favor in some situations, their importance
was so slight that they were not shown in the
model.

[208]
HOOSAC TUNNEL

It was possible in the model series, without neglecting
any major advancement in the art of rock
tunneling, to complete the sequence of development
with only a single additional model. Many of the
greatest works of civil engineering have been those
concerned directly with transport, and hence are the
product of the present era, beginning in the early
19th century. The development of the ancient arts of
route location, bridge construction, and tunnel
driving received a powerful stimulation after 1800
under the impetus of the modern canal, highway, and,
especially, the railroad.

The Hoosac Tunnel, driven through Hoosac
Mountain in the very northwest corner of Massachusetts
between 1851 and 1875, was the first major
tunneling work in the United States. Its importance
is due not so much to this as to its being literally
the fountainhead of modern rock-tunneling technology.
The remarkable thing is that the work was
begun using methods of driving almost unchanged
during centuries previous, and was completed twenty
years later by techniques which were, for the day,
almost totally mechanized. The basic pattern of
operation set at Hoosac, using pneumatic rock drills
and efficient explosives, remains practically unchanged
today.

The general history of the Hoosac project is so
thoroughly recorded that the briefest outline of its
political aspects will suffice here. Hoosac Mountain
was the chief obstacle in the path of a railroad projected
between Greenfield, Massachusetts, and Troy,
New York. The line was launched by a group of
Boston merchants to provide a direct route to the
rapidly developing West, in competition with the
coastal routes via New York. The only route
economically reasonable included a tunnel of nearly
five miles through the mountain&mdash;a length absolutely
without precedent, and an immense undertaking in
view of the relatively primitive rock-working methods
then available.

The bore&rsquo;s great length and the desire for rapid
exploitation inspired innovation from the outset of
the work. The earliest attempts at mechanization,
although ineffectual and without influence on tunnel
engineering until many years later, are of interest.
These took the form of several experimental machines
of the &ldquo;full area&rdquo; type, intended to excavate the entire
face of the work in a single operation by cutting one
or more concentric grooves in the rock. The rock
remaining between the grooves was to be blasted out.
The first such machine tested succeeded in boring a
24-foot diameter opening for 10 feet before its total
failure. Several later machines proved of equal
merit.
[2]
It was the Baltimore and Ohio&rsquo;s eminent
chief engineer, Benjamin H. Latrobe, who in his
Report on the Hoosac Tunnel (Baltimore, Oct. 1, 1862,
p. 125) stated that such apparatus contained in its
own structure the elements of failure, &ldquo; &#8230; as they
require the machines to do too much and the powder
too little of the work, thus contradicting the fundamental
principles upon which all labor-saving
machinery is framed &#8230; I could only look upon it
as a misapplication of mechanical genius.&rdquo;

[209]

Latrobe stated the basic philosophy of rock-tunnel
work. No mechanical agent has ever been able to
improve upon the efficiency of explosives for the shattering
of rock. For this reason, the logical application
of machinery to tunneling was not in replacing or
altering the fundamental process itself, but in enabling
it to be conducted with greater speed by mechanically
drilling the blasting holes to receive the explosive.

Actual work on the Hoosac Tunnel began at both
ends of the tunnel in about 1854, but without much
useful effect until 1858 when a contract was let to
the renowned civil engineer and railroad builder,
Herman Haupt of Philadelphia. Haupt immediately
resumed investigations of improved tunneling methods,
both full-area machines and mechanical rock
drills. At this time mechanical rock-drill technology
was in a state beyond, but not far beyond, initial
experimentation. There existed one workable American
machine, the Fowle drill, invented in 1851. It
was steam-driven, and had been used in quarry work,
although apparently not to any commercial extent.
However, it was far too large and cumbersome to
find any possible application in tunneling. Nevertheless,
it contained in its operating principle, the
seed of a practical rock drill in that the drill rod was
attached directly to and reciprocated by a double-acting
steam piston. A point of great importance
was the independence of its operation on gravity,
permitting drilling in any direction.

While experimenting, Haupt drove the work onward
by the classical methods, shown in the left-hand
section of the model (fig.&nbsp;2). At the far right an
advance heading or adit is being formed by pick and
hammer work; this is then deepened into a top
heading with enough height to permit hammer
drilling, actually the basic tunneling operation. A
team is shown &ldquo;double jacking,&rdquo; i.e., using two-handed
hammers, the steel held by a third man.
This was the most efficient of the several hand-drilling
methods. The top-heading plan was followed so
that the bulk of the rock could be removed in the
form of a bottom bench, and the majority of drilling
would be downward, obviously the most effective
direction. Blasting was with black powder and its
commercial variants. Some liberty was taken in depicting
these steps so that both operations might be
shown within the scope of the model: in practice
[210]
the heading was kept between 400 and 600 feet in
advance of the bench so that heading blasts would
not interfere with the bench work. The bench
carriage simply facilitated handling of the blasted
rock. It was rolled back during blasts.

The experiments conducted by Haupt with machine
drills produced no immediate useful results. A drill
designed by Haupt and his associate, Stuart Gwynn,
in 1858 bored hard granite at the rate of 5/8 inch per
minute, but was not substantial enough to bear up
in service. Haupt left the work in 1861, victim of
intense political pressures and totally unjust accusations
of corruption and mismanagement. The work
was suspended until taken over by a state commission
in 1862. Despite frightful ineptitude and very real
corruption, this period was exceedingly important
in the long history both of Hoosac Tunnel and of rock
tunneling in general.

The merely routine criticism of the project had by
this time become violent due to the inordinate length
of time already elapsed and the immense cost, compared
to the small portion of work completed. This
served to generate in the commission a strong sense
of urgency to hurry the project along. Charles S.
Storrow, a competent engineer, was sent to Europe
to report on the progress of tunneling there, and in
particular on mechanization at the Mont Cenis Tunnel
then under construction between France and Italy.
Germain Sommeiller, its chief engineer, had, after
experimentation similar to Haupt&rsquo;s, invented a
reasonably efficient drilling machine which had gone
into service at Mont Cenis in March 1861. It was
a distinct improvement over hand drilling, almost
doubling the drilling rate, but was complex and highly
unreliable. Two hundred drills were required to keep
16 drills at work. But the vital point in this was the
fact that Sommeiller drove his drills not with steam,
but air, compressed at the tunnel portals and piped
to the work face. It was this single factor, one of
application rather than invention, that made the
mechanical drill feasible for tunneling.

All previous effort in the field of machine drilling, on
both sides of the Atlantic, had been directed toward
steam as the motive power. In deep tunnels, with
ventilation already an inherent problem, the exhaust
of a steam drill into the atmosphere was inadmissible.
Further, steam could not be piped over great distances
due to serious losses of energy from radiation of heat,
and condensation. Steam generation within the
tunnel itself was obviously out of the question. It
was the combination of a practical drill, and the
parallel invention by Sommeiller of a practical air
compressor that resulted in the first workable application
of machine rock drilling to tunneling.

[211]

illuminated for photography, the Museum model was based primarily on

Leslie&#39;s Weekly, 1873.)


[212]

The Sommeiller drills greatly impressed Storrow,
and his report of November 1862 strongly favored
their adoption at Hoosac. It is curious however, that
not a single one was brought to the U.S., even on
trial. Storrow does speak of Sommeiller&rsquo;s intent to
keep the details of the machine to himself until it had
been further improved, with a view to its eventual
exploitation. The fact is, that although workable, the
Sommeiller drill proved to be a dead end in rock-drill
development because of its many basic deficiencies.
It did exert the indirect influence of inspiration which,
coupled with a pressing need for haste, led to renewed
trials of drilling machinery at Hoosac. Thomas
Doane, chief engineer under the state commission,
carried this program forth with intensity, seeking and
encouraging inventors, and himself working on the
problem. The pattern of the Sommeiller drill was
generally followed; that is, the drill was designed as
a separate, relatively light mechanical element,
adapted for transportation by several miners, and
attachable to a movable frame or carriage during
operation. Air was of course the presumed power.
To be effective, it was necessary that a drill automatically
feed the drill rod as the hole deepened, and
also rotate the rod automatically to maintain a round,
smooth hole. Extreme durability was essential, and
usually proved the source of a machine&rsquo;s failure.
The combination of these characteristics into a
machine capable of driving the drill rod into the rock
with great force, perhaps five times per second, was a
severe test of ingenuity and materials. Doane in 1864
had three different experimental drills in hand, as
well as various steam and water-powered compressors.

Success finally came in 1865 with the invention of
a drill by Charles Burleigh, a mechanical engineer
at the well-known Putnam Machine Works of Fitchburg,
Massachusetts. The drills were first applied
in the east heading in June of 1866. Although
working well, their initial success was limited by
lack of reliability and a resulting high expense for
repairs. They were described as having &ldquo;several
weakest points.&rdquo; In November, these drills were
replaced by an improved Burleigh drill which was
used with total success to the end of the work. The
era of modern rock tunneling was thus launched by
Sommeiller&rsquo;s insight in initially applying pneumatic
power to a machine drill, by Doane&rsquo;s persistence in
searching for a thoroughly practical drill, and by
Burleigh&rsquo;s mechanical talent in producing one. The
desperate need to complete the Hoosac Tunnel may
reasonably be considered the greatest single spur to
the development of a successful drill.

The significance of this invention was far reaching.
Burleigh&rsquo;s was the first practical mechanical rock
drill in America and, in view of its dependability,
efficiency, and simplicity when compared to the
Sommeiller drill, perhaps in the world. The Burleigh
drill achieved success almost immediately. It was
placed in production by Putnam for the Burleigh
Rock Drill Company before completion of Hoosac in
1876, and its use spread throughout the western
mining regions and other tunnel works. For a major
invention, its adoption was, in relative terms, instantaneous.
It was the prototype of all succeeding
piston-type drills, which came to be known generically
as &ldquo;burleighs,&rdquo; regardless of manufacture. Walter
Shanley, the Canadian contractor who ultimately
completed the Hoosac, reported in 1870, after the
drills had been in service for a sufficient time that
the techniques for their most efficient use were fully
understood and effectively applied, that the Burleigh
drills saved about half the drilling costs over hand
drilling. The per-inch cost of machine drilling
averaged 5.5 cents, all inclusive, vs. 11.2 cents for
handwork. The more important point, that of
speed, is shown by the reports of average monthly
progress of the tunnel itself, before and after use of
the air drills.

Figure 10.&mdash;Trinitroglycerine blast at Hoosac
Tunnel. (Leslie&#39;s Weekly, 1873.)


The right portion of the model (fig.&nbsp;3) represents
the workings during the final period. The bottom
heading system was generally used after the Burleigh
drills had been introduced. Four to six drills were
[213]
mounted on a carriage designed by Doane. These
drove the holes for the first blast in the center of the
heading in about six hours. The full width of the
heading, the 24-foot width of the tunnel, was then
drilled and blasted out in two more stages. As in
the early section, the benches to the rear were later
removed to the full-tunnel height of about 20 feet.
This operation is shown by a single drill (fig.&nbsp;4)
mounted on a screw column. Three 8-hour shifts carried
the work forward: drilling occupied half the
time and half was spent in running the carriage back,
blasting, and mucking (clearing the broken rock).

The tunnel&rsquo;s 1028-foot central shaft, completed
under the Shanley contract in 1870 to provide two
additional work faces as well as a ventilation shaft is
shown at the far right side of this half of the model.
Completed so near the end of the project, only 15
percent of the tunnel was driven from the shaft.

The enormous increase in rate of progress was not
due entirely to machine drilling. From the outset
of his jurisdiction, Doane undertook experiments with
explosives as well as drills, seeking an agent more
effective than black powder. In this case, the need
for speed was not the sole stimulus. As the east and
west headings advanced further and further from the
portals, the problem of ventilation grew more acute,
and it became increasingly difficult to exhaust the
toxic fumes produced by the black powder blasts.

In 1866, Doane imported from Europe a sample
of trinitroglycerine, the liquid explosive newly introduced
by Nobel, known in Europe as &ldquo;glonoÃ¯n oil&rdquo;
and in the United States as &ldquo;nitroglycerine.&rdquo; It
already had acquired a fearsome reputation from its
tendency to decompose with heat and age and to
explode with or without the slightest provocation.
Nevertheless, its tremendous power and characteristic
of almost complete smokelessness led Doane to
employ the chemist George W. Mowbray, who had
blasted for Drake in the Pennsylvania oil fields, to
develop techniques for the bulk manufacture of the
new agent and for its safe employment in the tunnel.

accuracy of the aboveground and

Mowbray established a works on the mountain and
shortly developed a completely new blasting practice
based on the explosive. Its stability was greatly increased
by maintaining absolute purity in the manufacturing
process. Freezing the liquid to reduce its
sensitivity during transport to the headings, and
extreme caution in its handling further reduced the
hazard of its use. At the heading, the liquid was
poured into cylindrical cartridges for placement in
the holes. As with the Burleigh drill, the general
adoption of nitroglycerine was immediate once its
qualities had been demonstrated. The effect on the
work was notable. Its explosive characteristics permitted
fewer blast holes over a given frontal area of
working face, and at the same time it was capable
of effectively blowing from a deeper drill hole, 42
inches against 30 inches for black powder, so that
under ideal conditions 40 percent more tunnel length
was advanced per cycle of operations. A new fuse
and a system of electric ignition were developed which
permitted simultaneous detonation and resulted in
a degree of effectiveness impossible with the powder
train and cord fusing used with the black powder.
Over a million pounds of nitroglycerine were produced
by Mowbray between 1866 and completion of
the tunnel.

When the Shanleys took the work over in 1868,
following political difficulties attending operation by
the State, the period of experimentation was over.
The tunnel was being advanced by totally modern
methods, and to the present day the overall concepts
have remained fundamentally unaltered: the Burleigh
piston drill has been replaced by the lighter
hammer drill; the Doane drill carriage by the more
flexible &ldquo;jumbo&rdquo;;nitroglycerine by its more stable
descendant dynamite and its alternatives; and static-electric
blasting machines by more dependable
magnetoelectric. But these are all in the nature of
improvements, not innovations.

Unlike the preceding model, there was good documentation
for this one. Also, the Hoosac was apparently
the first American tunnel to be well recorded
photographically. Early flashlight views exist of the
drills working at the heading (fig.&nbsp;6) as well as of the
portals, the winding and pumping works at the central
shaft, and much of the machinery and associated
aspects of the project. These and copies of drawings
of much of Doane&rsquo;s experimental apparatus, a rare
technological record, are preserved at the Massachusetts
State Library.



Soft-Ground Tunneling

So great is the difference between hard-rock and
soft-ground tunneling that they constitute two almost
separate branches of the field. In penetrating ground
lacking the firmness or cohesion to support itself above
an opening, the miner&rsquo;s chief concern is not that of
removing the material, but of preventing its collapse
into his excavation. The primitive methods depending
upon brute strength and direct application of fire
and human force were suitable for assault on rock,
but lacked the artifice needed for delving into less
stable material. Roman engineers were accomplished
in spanning subterranean ways with masonry arches,
but apparently most of their work was done by cut-and-cover
methods rather than by actual mining.

Not until the Middle Ages did the skill of effectively
working openings in soft ground develop, and not
until the Renaissance was this development so consistently
successful that it could be considered a
science.

RENAISSANCE MINING

From the earliest periods of rock working, the quest
for minerals and metals was the primary force that
drove men underground. It was the technology of
mining, the product of slow evolution over the
centuries, that became the technology of the early
tunnel, with no significant modification except in
size of workings.

Every aspect of 16th century mining is definitively
detailed in Georgius Agricola&rsquo;s remarkable De re
Metallica, first published in Basel in 1556. During
its time of active influence, which extended for two
centuries, it served as the authoritative work on the
subject. It remains today an unparalleled early record
of an entire branch of technology. The superb
woodcuts of mine workings and tools in themselves
constitute a precise description of the techniques of
the period, and provided an ideal source of information
upon which to base the first model in the soft-ground
series.

The model, representing a typical European mine,
demonstrates the early use of timber frames or
&ldquo;sets&rdquo; to support the soft material of the walls and roof.
In areas of only moderate instability, the sets alone
were sufficient to counteract the earth pressure, and
were spaced according to the degree of support
required. In more extreme conditions, a solid lagging
of small poles or boards was set outside the
frames, as shown in the model, to provide absolute
support of the ground. Details of the framing, the
windlass, and all tools and appliances were supplied
by Agricola, with no need for interpretation or
interpolation.

The basic framing pattern of sill, side posts and cap
piece, all morticed together, with lagging used where
needed, was translated unaltered into tunneling practice,
particularly in small exploratory drifts. It
remained in this application until well into the 20th
century.

The pressure exerted upon tunnels of large area
was countered during construction by timbering
systems of greater elaboration, evolved from the basic
one. By the time that tunnels of section large
enough to accommodate canals and railways were
being undertaken as matter-of-course civil engineering
works, a series of nationally distinguishable
systems had emerged, each possessing characteristic
points of favor and fault. As might be suspected, the
English system of tunnel timbering, for instance, was
rarely applied on the Continent, nor were the German,
Austrian or Belgian systems normally seen in Great
Britain. All were used at one time or another in
this country, until the American system was introduced
in about 1855. While the timbering commonly
remained in place in mines, it would be followed up
by permanent masonry arching and lining in tunnel
work.

Overhead in the museum Hall of Civil Engineering
[217]
are frames representing the English, Austrian and
American systems. Nearby, a series of small relief
models (fig.&nbsp;19) is used to show the sequence of enlargement
in a soft-ground railroad tunnel of about
1855, using the Austrian system. Temporary timber
support of tunnels fell from use gradually after the
advent of shield tunneling in conjunction with cast-iron
lining. This formed a perfect support immediately
behind the shield, as well as the permanent
lining of the tunnel.

BRUNEL&rsquo;S THAMES TUNNEL

The interior surfaces of tunnels through ground
merely unstable are amenable to support by various
systems of timbering and arching. This becomes less
true as the fluidity of the ground increases. The
soft material which normally comprises the beds of
rivers can approach an almost liquid condition
resulting in a hydraulic head from the overbearing
water sufficient to prevent the driving of even the
most carefully worked drift, supported by simple
timbering. The basic defect of the timbering systems
used in mining and tunneling was that there was
inevitably a certain amount of the face or ceiling
unsupported just previous to setting a frame, or
placing over it the necessary section of lagging. In
mine work, runny soil could, and did, break through
such gaps, filling the working. For this reason,
there were no serious attempts made before 1825 to
drive subaqueous tunnels.

In that year, work was started on a tunnel under the
Thames between the Rotherhithe and Wapping
sections of London, under guidance of the already
famous engineer Marc Isambard Brunel (1769-1849),
father of I. K. Brunel. The undertaking is of great
interest in that Brunel employed an entirely novel
apparatus of his own invention to provide continuous
and reliable support of the soft water-bearing clay
which formed the riverbed. By means of this
&ldquo;shield,&rdquo; Brunel was able to drive the world&rsquo;s first
subaqueous tunnel.
[3]

The shield was of cast-iron, rectangular in elevation,
and was propelled forward by jackscrews. Shelves at
top, bottom, and sides supported the tunnel roof,
floor, and walls until the permanent brick lining was
placed. The working face, the critical area, was
supported by a large number of small &ldquo;breasting
boards,&rdquo; held against the ground by small individual
screws bearing against the shield framework. The
shield itself was formed of 12 separate frames, each
of which could be advanced independently of the
others. The height was 22 feet 3 inches: the width
37 feet 6 inches.

The progress was piecemeal. In operation the
miners would remove one breasting board at a time,
excavate in front of it, and then replace it in the
advanced position&mdash;about 6 inches forward. This
was repeated with the next board above or below, and
the sequence continued until the ground for the
entire height of one of the 12 sections had been
removed. The board screws for that section were
shifted to bear on the adjacent frames, relieving the
[218]
frame of longitudinal pressure. It could then be
screwed forward by the amount of advance, the
screws bearing to the rear on the completed masonry.
Thus, step by step the tunnel progressed slowly, the
greatest weekly advance being 14 feet.

In the left-hand portion of the model is the shaft
sunk to begin operations; here also is shown the bucket
hoist for removing the spoil. The V-type steam engine
powering the hoist was designed by Brunel. At the
right of the main model is an enlarged detail of the
shield, actually an improved version built in 1835.

The work continued despite setbacks of every sort.
The financial ones need no recounting here. Technically,
although the shield principle proved workable,
the support afforded was not infallible. Four or five
times the river broke through the thin cover of silt
and flooded the workings, despite the utmost caution
in excavating. When this occurred, masses of clay,
sandbags, and mats were dumped over the opening
in the riverbed to seal it, and the tunnel pumped out.
I. K. Brunel acted as superintendent and nearly lost
his life on a number of occasions. After several suspensions
of work resulting from withdrawal or
exhaustion of support, one lasting seven years, the
work was completed in 1843.

Despite the fact that Brunel had, for the first time,
demonstrated a practical method for tunneling in firm
and water-bearing ground, the enormous cost of the
work and the almost overwhelming problems encountered
had a discouraging effect rather than otherwise.
Not for another quarter of a century was a similar
project undertaken.

The Thames Tunnel was used for foot and light
highway traffic until about 1870 when it was incorporated
into the London Underground railway
system, which it continues to serve today. The
roofed-over top sections of the two shafts may still be
seen from the river.

A number of contemporary popular accounts of the
tunnel exist, but one of the most thorough and
interesting expositions on a single tunnel work of any
period is Henry Law&rsquo;s A Memoir of the Thames Tunnel,
published in 1845-1846 by John Weale. Law, an
eminent civil engineer, covers the work in incredible
detail from its inception until the major suspension
in late 1828 when slightly more than half completed.
The most valuable aspect of his record is a series of
plates of engineering drawings of the shield and its
components, which, so far as is known, exist nowhere
else. These formed the basis of the enlarged section
of the shield, shown to the right of the model of the
tunnel itself. A vertical section through the shield
is reproduced here from Law for comparison with
the model (figs. 21 and 23).

Various inventors attempted to improve upon the
Brunel shield, aware of the fundamental soundness
of the shield principle. Almost all bypassed the
rectangular sectional construction used in the Thames
Tunnel, and took as a starting point a sectional
shield of circular cross section, advanced by Brunel
in his original patent of 1818. James Henry Greathead
(1844-1896), rightfully called the father of modern
subaqueous tunneling, surmised in later years that
Brunel had chosen a rectangular configuration for
actual use, as one better adapted to the sectional
type of shield. The English civil engineer, Peter W.
Barlow, in 1864 and 1868 patented a circular shield,
of one piece, which was the basis of one used by him in
constructing a small subway of 1350 feet beneath the
Thames in 1869, the first work to follow the lead of
Brunel. Greathead, acting as Barlow&rsquo;s contractor,
was the designer of the shield actually used in the
work, but it was obviously inspired by Barlow&rsquo;s
patents.

The reduction of the multiplicity of parts in the
Brunel shield to a single rigid unit was of immense
advantage and an advance perhaps equal to the
shield concept of tunneling itself. The Barlow-Greathead
shield was like the cap of a telescope with
a sharpened circular ring on the front to assist in
penetrating the ground. The diaphragm functioned,
as did Brunel&rsquo;s breasting boards, to resist the longitudinal
earth pressure of the face, and the cylindrical
portion behind the diaphragm bore the radial pressure
of roof and walls. Here also for the first time, a
permanent lining formed of cast-iron segments was
used, a second major advancement in soft-ground
tunneling practice. Not only could the segments be
placed and bolted together far more rapidly than
masonry lining could be laid up, but unlike the
green masonry, they could immediately bear the full
force of the shield-propelling screws.

Barlow, capitalizing on Brunel&rsquo;s error in burrowing
so close to the riverbed, maintained an average cover
of 30 feet over the tunnel, driving through a solid
stratum of firm London clay which was virtually
impervious to water. As the result of this, combined
with the advantages of the solid shield and the
rapidly placed iron lining, the work moved forward
at a pace and with a facility in startling contrast to
that of the Thames Tunnel, although in fairness it
must be recalled that the face area was far less.

The clay was found sufficiently sound that it could
be readily excavated without the support of the diaphragm,
and normally three miners worked in front
of the shield, digging out the clay and passing it
back through a doorway in the plate. This could be
closed in case of a sudden settlement or break in.
Following excavation, the shield was advanced 18
inches into the excavated area by means of 6 screws,
and a ring of lining segments 18 inches in length
bolted to the previous ring under cover of the overlapping
rear skirt of the shield. The small annular
space left between the outside of the lining and the
clay by the thickness and clearance of the skirt&mdash;about
an inch&mdash;was filled with thin cement grout. The
tunnel was advanced 18 inches during each 8-hour
shift. The work continued around the clock, and the
900-foot river section was completed in only 14 weeks.

[4]
The entire work was completed almost without
incident in just under a year, a remarkable performance
for the world&rsquo;s second subaqueous tunnel.

The Tower Subway at first operated with cylindrical
cars that nearly filled the 7-foot bore; the cars
were drawn by cables powered by small steam
engines in the shafts. This mode of power had previously
been used in passenger service only on the
Greenwich Street elevated railway in New York.
Later the cars were abandoned as unprofitable and
the tunnel turned into a footway (fig.&nbsp;32). This small
tunnel, the successful driving due entirely to Greathead&rsquo;s
skill, was the forerunner of the modern subaqueous
tunnel. In it, two of the three elements
essential to such work thereafter were first applied:
the one-piece movable shield of circular section, and
the segmental cast-iron lining.

The documentation of this work is far thinner than
for the Thames Tunnel. The most accurate source of
technical information is a brief historical account in
Copperthwaite&rsquo;s classic Tunnel Shields and the Use of
Compressed Air in Subaqueous Works, published in 1906.
Copperthwaite, a successful tunnel engineer, laments
the fact that he was able to turn up no drawing or
original data on this first shield of Greathead&rsquo;s, but
he presents a sketch of it prepared in the Greathead
office in 1895, which is presumably a fair representation
(fig.&nbsp;33). The Tower Subway model was built
on the basis of this and several woodcuts of the working
area that appeared contemporaneously in the
illustrated press. In this and the adjacent model of
Beach&rsquo;s Broadway Subway, the tunnel axis has been
placed on an angle to the viewer, projecting the bore
into the case so that the complete circle of the working
face is included for a more suggestive effect. This
was possible because of the short length of the work
included.

Henry S. Drinker, also a tunnel engineer and author
of the most comprehensive work on tunneling ever
published, treats rock tunneling in exhaustive detail
up to 1878. His notice of what he terms &ldquo;submarine
tunneling&rdquo; is extremely brief. He does, however,
draw a most interesting comparison between the first
Thames Tunnel, built by Brunel, and the second,
built by Greathead 26 years later:

BEACH&rsquo;S BROADWAY SUBWAY

Almost simultaneously with the construction of the
Tower Subway, the first American shield tunnel was
driven by Alfred Ely Beach (1826-1896). Beach, as
editor of the Scientific American and inventor of, among
other things, a successful typewriter as early as 1856,
was well known and respected in technical circles.
He was not a civil engineer, but had become concerned
with New York&rsquo;s pressing traffic problem
(even then) and as a solution, developed plans for a
rapid-transit subway to extend the length of Broadway.
He invented a shield as an adjunct to this system,
solely to permit driving of the tunnel without disturbing
the overlying streets.

An active patent attorney as well, Beach must
certainly have known of and studied the existing
patents for tunneling shields, which were, without
exception, British. In certain aspects his shield
resembled the one patented by Barlow in 1864, but
never built. However, work on the Beach tunnel
started in 1869, so close in time to that on the Tower
[228]
Subway, that it is unlikely that there was any influence
from that source. Beach had himself patented
a shield, in June 1869, a two-piece, sectional design
that bore no resemblance to the one used. His
subway plan had been first introduced at the 1867
fair of the American Institute in the form of a short
plywood tube through which a small, close-fitting
car was blown by a fan. The car carried 12 passengers.
Sensing opposition to the subway scheme
from Tammany, in 1868 Beach obtained a charter
to place a small tube beneath Broadway for transporting
mail and small packages pneumatically, a
plan he advocated independently of the passenger
subway.

Under this thin pretense of legal authorization, the
sub-rosa excavation began from the basement of a
clothing store on Warren Street near Broadway. The
8-foot-diameter tunnel ran eastward a short distance,
made a 90-degree turn, and thence southward under
[229]
Broadway to stop a block away under the south side
of Murray Street. The total distance was about 312
feet. Work was carried on at night in total secrecy,
the actual tunneling taking 58 nights. At the Warren
Street terminal, a waiting room was excavated and a
large Roots blower installed for propulsion of the single
passenger car. The plan was similar to that used
with the model in 1867: the cylindrical car fitted the
circular tunnel with only slight circumferential clearance.
The blower created a plenum within the waiting
room and tunnel area behind the car of about
0.25 pounds per square inch, resulting in a thrust on
the car of almost a ton, not accounting for blowby.
The car was thus blown along its course, and was
returned by reversing the blower&rsquo;s suction and discharge
ducts to produce an equivalent vacuum within
the tunnel.

shield used at the Tower Subway, 1869. The
first one-piece shield of circular section.
(Copperthwaite,
Tunnel Shields and the Use of Compressed
Air in Subaqueous Works.)


The system opened in February of 1870 and remained
in operation for about a year. Beach was
ultimately subdued by the hostile influences of Boss
Tweed, and the project was completely abandoned.
Within a very few more years the first commercially
operated elevated line was built, but the subway did
not achieve legitimate status in New York until the
opening of the Interborough line in 1904. Ironically,
its route traversed Broadway for almost the length of
the island.





Figure 32.&mdash;Interior of completed Tower Subway.
(Thornbury, Old and New London, 1887,
vol. 1, p. 126.)


The Beach shield operated with perfect success in
this brief trial, although the loose sandy soil encountered
was admittedly not a severe test of its qualities.
No diaphragm was used; instead a series of 8 horizontal
shelves with sharpened leading edges extended
across the front opening of the shield. The outstanding
feature of the machine was the substitution
for the propelling screws used by Brunel and
Greathead of 18 hydraulic rams, set around its
circumference. These were fed by a single hand-operated
pump, seen in the center of figure 34. By
this means the course of the shield&rsquo;s forward movement
could be controlled with a convenience and
[230]
precision not attainable with screws. Vertical and
horizontal deflection was achieved by throttling the
supply of water to certain of the rams, which could
be individually controlled, causing greater pressure
on one portion of the shield than another. This
system has not changed in the ensuing time, except,
of course, in the substitution of mechanically produced
hydraulic pressure for hand.

Unlike the driving of the Tower Subway, no excavation
was done in front of the shield. Rather,
the shield was forced by the rams into the soil for
the length of their stroke, the material which entered
being supported by the shelves. This was removed
from the shelves and hauled off. The ram plungers
then were withdrawn and a 16-inch length of the
permanent lining built up within the shelter of the
shield&rsquo;s tail ring. Against this, the rams bore for the
next advance. Masonry lining was used in the
straight section; cast-iron in the curved. The juncture
is shown in the model.

Enlarged versions of the Beach shield were used in a
few tunnels in the Midwest in the early 1870&rsquo;s, but
from then until 1886 the shield method, for no clear
reason, again entered a period of disuse finding no
application on either side of the Atlantic despite its
virtually unqualified proof at the hands of Greathead
and Beach. Little precise information remains on
this work. The Beach system of pneumatic transit is
described fully in a well-illustrated booklet published
by him in January 1868, in which the American Institute
model is shown, and many projected systems
of pneumatic propulsion as well as of subterranean
and subaqueous tunneling described. Beach again
(presumably) is author of the sole contemporary account
of the Broadway Subway, which appeared in
Scientific American following its opening early in 1870.
Included are good views of the tunnel and car, of the
shield in operation, and, most important, a vertical
sectional view through the shield (fig.&nbsp;35).

It is interesting to note that optical surveys for
maintenance of the course apparently were not used.
The article illustrated and described the driving each
night of a jointed iron rod up through the tunnel
roof to the street, twenty or so feet above, for &ldquo;testing
the position.&rdquo;


THE FIRST HUDSON RIVER TUNNEL

Despite the ultimate success of Brunel&rsquo;s Thames
Tunnel in 1843, the shield in that case afforded only
moderately reliable protection because of the fluidity
of the soil driven through, and its tendency to enter
the works through the smallest opening in the shield&rsquo;s
defense. An English doctor who had made physiological
studies of the effects on workmen of the high
air pressure within diving bells is said to have recommended
to Brunel in 1828 that he introduce an
atmosphere of compressed air into the tunnel to exclude
the water and support the work face.

This plan was first formally described by Sir Thomas
Cochrane (1775-1860) in a British patent of 1830.
Conscious of Brunel&rsquo;s problems, he proposed a system
of shaft sinking, mining, and tunneling in water-bearing
materials by filling the excavated area with
[232]
air sufficiently above atmospheric pressure to prevent
the water from entering and to support the earth. In
this, and his description of air locks for passage of men
and materials between the atmosphere and the pressurized
area, Cochrane fully outlined the essential
features of pneumatic excavation as developed since.

    alignment of the Broadway Subway at night by driving a jointed
    rod up to street level. (Scientific American, March 5, 1870.)
  



In 1839, a French engineer first used the system in
sinking a mine shaft through a watery stratum. From
then on, the sinking of shafts, and somewhat later the
construction of bridge pier foundations, by the pneumatic
method became almost commonplace engineering
practice in Europe and America. Not until 1879
however, was the system tried in tunneling work, and
then, as with the shield ten years earlier, almost
simultaneously here and abroad. The first application
was in a small river tunnel in Antwerp, only
5 feet in height. This project was successfully completed
relying on compressed air alone to support the
earth, no shield being used. The importance of the
work cannot be considered great due to its lack of
scope.

In 1871 Dewitt C. Haskin (1822-1900), a west
coast mine and railroad builder, became interested
in the pneumatic caissons then being used to found
the river piers of Eads&rsquo; Mississippi River bridge at
St. Louis. In apparent total ignorance of the Cochrane
patent, he evolved a similar system for tunneling
water-bearing media, and in 1873 proposed construction
of a tunnel through the silt beneath the Hudson
to provide rail connection between New Jersey and
New York City.

[233]

[234]

It would be difficult to imagine a site more in need
of such communication. All lines from the south
terminated along the west shore of the river and the
immense traffic&mdash;cars, freight and passengers&mdash;was
carried across to Manhattan Island by ferry and
barge with staggering inconvenience and at enormous
cost. A bridge would have been, and still is, almost
out of the question due not only to the width of the
crossing, but to the flatness of both banks. To provide
sufficient navigational clearance (without a drawspan),
impracticably long approaches would have
been necessary to obtain a permissibly gentle grade.


Haskin formed a tunneling company and began
work with the sinking of a shaft in Hoboken on the
New Jersey side. In a month it was halted because
of an injunction by, curiously, the D L &amp; W Railroad,
who feared for their vast investment in terminal and
marine facilities. Not until November of 1879 was
the injunction lifted and work again commenced.
The shaft was completed and an air lock located in
one wall from which the tunnel proper was to be
carried forward. It was Haskin&rsquo;s plan to use no
shield, relying solely on the pressure of compressed
air to maintain the work faces and prevent the entry
of water. The air was admitted in late December,
and the first large-scale pneumatic tunneling operation
launched. A single 26-foot, double-track bore
was at first undertaken, but a work face of such
diameter proved unmanageable and two oval tubes
18 feet high by 16 feet wide were substituted, each
to carry a single track. Work went forward with
reasonable facility, considering the lack of precedent.
A temporary entrance was formed of sheet-iron rings
from the air lock down to the tunnel grade, at which
point the permanent work of the north tube was
started. Immediately behind the excavation at the
face, a lining of thin wrought-iron plates was built up,
to provide form for the 2-foot, permanent brick lining
that followed. The three stages are shown in the
model in about their proper relationship of progress.
The work is shown passing beneath an old timber-crib
bulkhead, used for stabilizing the shoreline.

The silt of the riverbed was about the consistency of
putty and under good conditions formed a secure
barrier between the excavation and the river above.
It was easily excavated, and for removal was mixed
with water and blown out through a pipe into the
shaft by the higher pressure in the tunnel. About
half was left in the bore for removal later. The basic
scheme was workable, but in operation an extreme
precision was required in regulating the air pressure
in the work area.
[5] It was soon found that there
existed an 11-psi difference between the pressure of
water on the top and the bottom of the working face,
due to the 22-foot height of the unlined opening.
Thus, it was impossible to maintain perfect pneumatic
balance of the external pressure over the entire face.
It was necessary to strike an average with the result
that some water entered at the bottom of the face
where the water pressure was greatest, and some air
leaked out at the top where the water pressure was
below the air pressure. Constant attention was essential:
several men did nothing but watch the behavior
of the leaks and adjusted the pressure as the
ground density changed with advance. Air was supplied
by several steam-driven compressors at the
surface.

The air lock permitted passage back and forth of men
and supplies between the atmosphere and the work
area, without disturbing the pressure differential.
This principle is demonstrated by an animated model
set into the main model, to the left of the shaft
(fig.&nbsp;39). The variation of
pressure within the lock chamber
to match the atmosphere or the pressurized area,
depending on the direction of passage, is clearly
shown by simplified valves and gauges, and by the
use of light in varying color density. In the Haskin
tunnel, 5 to 10 minutes were taken to pass the miners
through the lock so as to avoid too abrupt a physiological
change.

[235]

Despite caution, a blowout occurred in July 1880
due to air leakage not at the face, but around the
temporary entrance. One door of the air lock jammed
and twenty men drowned, resulting in an inquiry
which brought forth much of the distrust with which
Haskin was regarded by the engineering profession.
His ability and qualifications were subjected to the
bitterest attack in and by the technical press. There
is some indication that, although the project began
with a staff of competent engineers, they were
alienated by Haskin in the course of work and at least
one withdrew. Haskin&rsquo;s remarks in his own defense
indicate that some of the denunciation was undoubtedly
justified. And yet, despite this reaction, the
fundamental merit of the pneumatic tunneling method
had been demonstrated by Haskin and was immediately
recognized and freely acknowledged. It was
apparent at the same time, however, that air by itself
did not provide a sufficiently reliable support for
large-area tunnel works in unstable ground, and this
remains the only major subaqueous tunnel work
driven with air alone.

After the accident, work continued under Haskin
until 1882 when funds ran out. About 1600 feet of
the north tube and 600 feet of the south tube had been
completed. Greathead resumed operations with a
shield for a British company in 1889, but exhaustion
of funds again caused stoppage in 1891. The tunnel
[236]
was finally completed in 1904, and is now in use as part
of the Hudson and Manhattan rapid-transit system,
never providing the sought-after rail link. A splendid
document of the Haskin portion of the work is S. D. V.
Burr&rsquo;s Tunneling Under the Hudson River published in
1885. It is based entirely upon firsthand material and
contains drawings of most of the work, including the
auxiliary apparatus. It is interesting to note that
electric illumination (arc, not incandescent, lights) and
telephones were used, unquestionably the first employment
of either in tunnel work.

THE ST. CLAIR TUNNEL

The final model of the soft-ground series reflects, as
did the Hoosac Tunnel model for hard-rock tunneling,
final emergence into the modern period. Although
the St. Clair Tunnel was completed over 70 years ago,
it typifies in its method of construction, the basic
procedures of subaqueous work in the present day.
The Thames Tunnel of Brunel, and Haskin&rsquo;s efforts
beneath the Hudson, had clearly shown that by
themselves, both the shield and pneumatic systems of
driving through fluid ground were defective in practice
for tunnels of large area. Note that the earliest
successful works by each method had been of very
small area, so that the influence of adverse conditions
was greatly diminished.

The first man to perceive and seize upon the benefits
to be gained by combining the two systems was,
most fittingly, Greathead. Although he had projected
the technique earlier, in driving the underground City
and South London Railway in 1886, he brought
together for the first time the three fundamental elements
essential for the practical tunneling of soft,
water-bearing ground: compressed-air support of the
work during construction, the movable shield, and cast-iron,
permanent lining. The marriage was a happy
one indeed; the limitations of each system were almost
perfectly overcome by the qualities of the others.

The conditions prevailing in 1882 at the Sarnia,
Ontario, terminal of the Grand Trunk Railway, both
operational and physical, were almost precisely the
same as those which inspired the undertaking of the
[237]
Hudson River Tunnel. The heavy traffic at this
vital U.S.&mdash;Canada rail interchange was ferried inconveniently
across the wide St. Clair River, and the
bank and river conditions precluded construction of a
bridge. A tunnel was projected by the railway in
that year, the time when Haskin&rsquo;s tribulations were
at their height. Perhaps because of this lack of precedent
for a work of such size, nothing was done
immediately. In 1884 the railway organized a tunnel
company; in 1886 test borings were made in the riverbed
and small exploratory drifts were started across
from both banks by normal methods of mine timbering.
The natural gas, quicksand, and water
encountered soon stopped the work.

the erector arm placing a cast-iron lining segment. The three motions of
the arm&mdash;axial, radial, and rotational, were manually powered.
(Smithsonian photo 49260-C.)


It was at this time that the railway&rsquo;s president
visited Greathead&rsquo;s City and South London workings.
The obvious answer to the St. Clair problem lay in
the successful conduct of this subway. Joseph
Hobson, chief engineer of the Grand Trunk and of
the tunnel project, in designing a shield, is said to
have searched for drawings of the shields used in
the Broadway and Tower Subways of 1868-9, but
unable to locate any, he relied to a limited extent
on the small drawings of those in Drinker&rsquo;s volume.
There is no explanation as to why he did not have
drawings of the City and South London shield at that
moment in use, unless one considers the rather unlikely
possibility that Greathead maintained its
design in secrecy.

of the St. Clair Tunnel, 1891. (Photo courtesy of Detroit
Library, Burton Historical Collection.)


The Hobson shield followed Greathead&rsquo;s as closely
as any other, in having a diaphragm with closable
doors, but a modification of Beach&rsquo;s sharpened
horizontal shelves was also used. However, these
functioned more as working platforms than supports
for the earth. The machine was 211/2 feet in diameter,
an unprecedented size and almost twice that of
Greathead&rsquo;s current one. It was driven by 24
hydraulic rams. Throughout the entire preliminary
consideration of the project there was a marked sense
of caution that amounted to what seems an almost
total lack of confidence in success. Commencement
of the work from vertical shafts was planned so that
if the tunnel itself failed, no expenditure would have
been made for approach work. In April 1888, the
[238]
shafts were started near both riverbanks, but before
reaching proper depth the almost fluid clay and silt
flowed up faster than it could be excavated and this
plan was abandoned. After this second inauspicious
start, long open approach cuts were made and the
work finally began. The portals were established in
the cuts, several thousand feet back from each bank
and there the tunneling itself began. The portions
under the shore were driven without air. When the
banks were reached, brick bulkheads containing air
locks were built across the opening and the section
beneath the river, about 3,710 feet long, driven under
air pressure of 10 to 28 pounds above atmosphere.
For most of the way, the clay was firm and there was
little air leakage. It was found that horses could not
survive in the compressed air, and so mules were
used under the river.

In the firm clay, excavation was carried on several
feet in front of the shield, as shown in the model
(fig.&nbsp;42). About twelve
miners worked at the face. However,
in certain strata the clay encountered was so
fluid that the shield could be simply driven forward by
the rams, causing the muck to flow in at the door
openings without excavation. After each advance,
the rams were retracted and a ring of iron lining
segments built up, as in the Tower Subway. Here,
for the first time, an &ldquo;erector arm&rdquo; was used for
placing the segments, which weighed about half a ton.
In all respects, the work advanced with wonderful
facility and lack of operational difficulty. Considering
[239]
the large area, no subaqueous tunnel had ever
been driven with such speed. The average monthly
progress for the American and Canadian headings
totaled 455 feet, and at top efficiency 10 rings or a
length of 15.3 feet could be set in a 24-hour day in
each heading. The 6,000 feet of tunnel was driven in
just a year; the two shields met vis-a-vis in August of
1890.

The transition was complete. The work had been
closely followed by the technical journals and the
reports of its successful accomplishment thus were
brought to the attention of the entire civil engineering
profession. As the first major subaqueous tunnel
completed in America and the first in the world of
a size able to accommodate full-scale rail traffic, the
St. Clair Tunnel served to dispel the doubts surrounding
such work, and established the pattern for a mode
of tunneling which has since changed only in matters
of detail.

Of the eight models, only this one was built under
the positive guidance of original documents. In the
possession of the Canadian National Railways are
drawings not only of all elements of the shield and
lining, but of much of the auxiliary apparatus used
in construction. Such materials rarely survive, and
do so in this case only because of the foresight of the
railway which, to avoid paying a high profit margin
to a private contractor as compensation for the risk
and uncertainty involved, carried the contract itself
and, therefore, preserved all original drawing records.

While the engineering of tunnels has been comprehensively
treated in this paper from the historical
standpoint, it is well to still reflect that the advances
made in tunneling have not perceptibly removed the
elements of uncertainty but have only provided more
positive and effective means of countering their
forces. Still to be faced are the surprises of hidden
streams, geologic faults, shifts of strata, unstable materials,
and areas of extreme pressure and temperature.

FOOTNOTES



[1] There are two important secondary techniques for opening
subterranean and subaqueous ways, neither a method truly of
tunneling. One of these, of ancient origin, used mainly in the
construction of shallow subways and utility ways, is the &ldquo;cut
and cover&rdquo; system, whereby an open trench is excavated and
then roofed over. The result is, in effect, a tunnel. The concept
of the other method was propounded in the early 19th
century but only used practically in recent years. This is the
&ldquo;trench&rdquo; method, a sort of subaqueous equivalent of cut and
cover. A trench is dredged in the bed of a body of water,
into which prefabricated sections of large diameter tube are
lowered, in a continuous line. The joints are then sealed by
divers, the trench is backfilled over the tube, the ends are
brought up to dryland portals, the water is pumped out, and a
subterranean passage results. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge
Tunnel (1960-1964) is a recent major work of this character.


[2] In 1952 a successful machine was developed on this plan,
with hardened rollers on a revolving cutting head for disintegrating
the rock. The idea is basically sound, possessing advantages
in certain situations over conventional drilling and
blasting systems.


[3] In 1807 the noted Cornish engineer Trevithick commenced
a small timbered drift beneath the Thames, 5 feet by 3 feet, as
an exploratory passage for a larger vehicular tunnel. Due to
the small frontal area, he was able to successfully probe about
1000 feet, but the river then broke in and halted the work.
Mine tunnels had also reached beneath the Irish Sea and various
rivers in the coal regions of Newcastle, but these were so far
below the surface as to be in perfectly solid ground and can
hardly be considered subaqueous workings.


[4] Unlike the Brunel tunnel, this was driven from both ends
simultaneously, the total overall progress thus being 3 feet per
shift rather than 18 inches. A top speed of 9 feet per day could
be advanced by each shield under ideal conditions.


[5] Ideally, the pressure of air within the work area of a
pneumatically driven tunnel should just balance the hydrostatic head of
the water without, which is a function of its total height above the
opening. If the air pressure is not high enough, water will, of course,
enter, and if very low, there is danger of complete collapse of the
unsupported ground areas. If too high, the air pressure will overcome
that due to the water and the air will force its way out through the
ground, through increasingly larger openings, until it all rushes out
suddenly in a &ldquo;blowout.&rdquo; The pressurized atmosphere gone, the water then
is able to pour in through the same opening, flooding the workings.

The &ldquo;PIONEER&rdquo;:LIGHT PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVEof 1851
In the Museum of History and Technology


In the mid-nineteenth century there was a renewed interest in
the light, single-axle locomotives which were proving so very
successful for passenger traffic. These engines were built in
limited number by nearly every well-known maker, and among the
few remaining is the 6-wheel &ldquo;Pioneer,&rdquo; on display in the Museum
of History and Technology, Smithsonian Institution. This
locomotive is a true representation of a light passenger
locomotive of 1851 and a historic relic of the mid-nineteenth
century.

The Author: John H. White is associate curator of
transportation in the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s Museum of
History and Technology.


The &ldquo;Pioneer&rdquo;
is an unusual locomotive and on first inspection would
seem to be imperfect for service on an American railroad of the 1850&rsquo;s.
This locomotive has only one pair of driving wheels and no truck, an
arrangement which marks it as very different from the highly successful
standard 8-wheel engine of this period. All six wheels of the Pioneer
are rigidly attached to the frame. It is only half the size of an
8-wheel engine of 1851 and about the same size of the 4&mdash;2&mdash;0 so common
in this country some 20 years earlier. Its general arrangement is that
of the rigid English locomotive which had, years earlier, proven
unsuitable for use on U.S. railroads.

These objections are more apparent than real, for the Pioneer, and
other engines of the same design, proved eminently successful when used
in the service for which they were built, that of light passenger
traffic. The Pioneer&rsquo;s rigid wheelbase is no problem, for when it is
compared to that of an 8-wheel engine it is found to be about four feet
less; and its small size is no problem when we realize it was not
intended for heavy service. Figure 2, a diagram, is a comparison of the
Pioneer and a standard 8-wheel locomotive.

Since the service life of the Pioneer was spent on the Cumberland
Valley Railroad, a brief account of that line is necessary to an
understanding of the service history of this locomotive.

[244]


Exhibits of the &ldquo;Pioneer&rdquo;

The Pioneer has been a historic relic since 1901. In the fall
of that year minor repairs were made to the locomotive so that
it might be used in the sesquicentennial celebration at
Carlisle, Pennsylvania. On October 22, 1901, the engine was
ready for service, but as it neared Carlisle a copper flue
burst. The fire was extinguished and the Pioneer was pushed
into town by another engine. In the twentieth century, the
Pioneer was displayed at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition,
St. Louis, Missouri, in 1904, and at the Wheeling, West
Virginia, semicentennial in 1913. In 1927 it joined many other
historic locomotives at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fair
of the Iron Horse&rdquo; which commemorated the first one hundred
years of that company. From about 1913 to 1925 the Pioneer
also appeared a number of times at the Apple-blossom Festival
at Winchester, Virginia. In 1933-1934 it was displayed at the
World&rsquo;s Fair in Chicago, and in 1948 at the Railroad Fair in the
same city. Between 1934 and March 1947 it was exhibited at the
Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The Cumberland Valley Railroad

The Cumberland Valley Railroad (C.V.R.R.) was chartered on April 2,
1831, to connect the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers by a railroad
through the Cumberland Valley in south-central Pennsylvania. The
Cumberland Valley, with its rich farmland and iron-ore deposits, was a
natural north-south route long used as a portage between these two
rivers. Construction began in 1836, and because of the level valley some
52 miles of line was completed between Harrisburg and Chambersburg by
November 16, 1837. In 1860, by way of the Franklin Railroad, the line
extended to Hagerstown, Maryland. It was not until 1871 that the
Cumberland Valley Railroad reached its projected southern terminus, the
Potomac River, by extending to Powells Bend, Maryland. Winchester,
Virginia, was entered in 1890 giving the Cumberland Valley Railroad
about 165 miles of line. The railroad which had become associated with
the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1859, was merged with that company in 1919.

By 1849 the Cumberland Valley Railroad was in poor condition; the
strap-rail track was worn out and new locomotives were needed. Captain
Daniel Tyler was hired to supervise rebuilding the line with T-rail, and
easy grades and curves. Tyler recommended that a young friend of his,
Alba F. Smith, be put in charge of modernizing and acquiring new
equipment. Smith recommended to the railroad&rsquo;s Board of Managers on June
25, 1851, that &ldquo;much lighter engines than those now in use may be
substituted for the passenger transportation and thereby effect a great
saving both in point of fuel and road repairs&#8230;.&rdquo;[1] Smith may well
have gone on to explain that the road was operating 3- and 4-car
passenger trains with a locomotive weighing about 20 tons; the total
weight was about 75 tons, equalling the uneconomical deadweight of 1200
pounds per passenger. Since speed was not an important consideration (30
mph being a good average), the use of lighter engines would improve the
deadweight-to-passenger ratio and would not result in a slower schedule.

The Board of Managers agreed with Smith&rsquo;s recommendations and instructed
him &ldquo;&#8230; to examine the two locomotives lately built by Mr. Wilmarth
and now in the [protection?] of Captain Tyler at Norwich and if in his
judgment they are adequate to our wants &#8230; have them forwarded to the
road.&rdquo;
[2] Smith inspected the locomotives not long after this resolution
was passed, for they were on the road by the time he made the following
report
[3] to the Board on September 24, 1851:

In accordance with a resolution passed at the last meeting of
your body relative to the small engines built by Mr. Wilmarth I
proceeded to Norwich to make trial of their capacity&mdash;fitness or
suitability to the Passenger transportation of our Road&mdash;and
after as thorough a trial as circumstances would admit (being on
another Road than our own) I became satisfied that with some
necessary improvements which would not be expensive (and are now
being made at our shop)
[245]
the engines would do the business of our Road not only in a
manner satisfactory in point of speed and certainty but with
greater ultimate economy in Expenses than has before been
practised in this Country.

After making the above trial of the Engines&mdash;I stated to your
Hon. President the result of the trial&mdash;with my opinion of their
Capacity to carry our passenger trains at the speed required
which was decidedly in favor of the ability of the Engines. He
accordingly agreed that the Engines should at once be forwarded
to the Road in compliance with the Resolution of your Board. I
immediately ordered the Engines shipped at the most favorable
rates. They came to our Road safely in the Condition in which
they were shipped. One of the Engines has been placed on the
Road and I believe performed in such a manner as to convince all
who are able to judge of this ability to perform&mdash;although the
maximum duty of the Engines was not performed on account of some
original defects which are now being remedied as I before
stated.

Within ten days the Engine will be able to run regularly with a
train on the Road where in shall be enabled to judge correctly
of their merits.

An accident occurred during the trial of the Small Engine at
Norwich which caused a damage of about $300 in which condition
the Engine came here and is now being repaired&mdash;the cost of
which will be presented to your Board hereafter. As to the
fault or blame of parties connected with the accident as also
the question of responsibility for Repairs are questions for
your disposal. I therefore leave the matter until further called
upon.

The Expenses necessarily incurred by the trial of the Engines
and also the Expenses of transporting the same are not included
in the Statement herewith presented, the whole amount of which
will not probably exceed $400.00.


These two locomotives became the Cumberland Valley Railroad&rsquo;s Pioneer
(number 13) and Jenny Lind (number 14). While Smith notes that one of
the engines was damaged during the inspection trials, Joseph Winters, an
employee of the Cumberland Valley who claimed he was accompanying the
engine enroute to Chambersburg at the time of their delivery, later
recalled that both engines were damaged in transit.[4] According to
Winters a train ran into the rear of the Jenny Lind, damaging both it
and the Pioneer, the accident occurring near Middletown, Pennsylvania.
The Jenny Lind was repaired at Harrisburg but the Pioneer, less
seriously damaged, was taken for repairs to the main shops of the
Cumberland Valley road at Chambersburg.

[246]

large headlamp. Note the lamp on the cab roof, now used as the
headlight. (Smithsonian photo 49272.)


While there seems little question that these locomotives were not built
as a direct order for the Cumberland Valley Railroad, an
article[5]
appearing in the Railroad Advocate in 1855 credits their design to
Smith. The article speaks of a 2&mdash;2&mdash;4 built for the Macon and Western
Railroad and says in part:

This engine is designed and built very generally upon the ideas,
embodied in some small tank engines designed by A. F. Smith,
Esq., for the Cumberland Valley road. Mr. Smith is a strong
advocate of light engines, and his novel style and proportions
of engines, as built for him a few years since, by Seth
Wilmarth, at Boston, are known to some of our readers. Without
knowing all the circumstances under which these engines are
worked on the Cumberland Valley road, we should not venture to
repeat all that we have heard of their performances, it is
enough to say that they are said to do more, in proportion to
their weight, than any other engines now in use.

The author believes that the Railroad Advocate&rsquo;s claim of Smith&rsquo;s
design of the Pioneer has been confused with his design of the
Utility (figs. 6, 7). Smith designed this compensating-lever engine to
haul trains over the C.V.R.R. bridge at Harrisburg. It was built by
Wilmarth in 1854.






Figure 4.&mdash;Map of the Cumberland Valley Railroad as it
appeared in 1919.



Figure 5.&mdash;An early broadside of the Cumberland Valley
Railroad.


According to statements of Smith and the Board of Managers quoted on
page 244, the Pioneer and the Jenny Lind were not new when purchased
from their maker, Seth Wilmarth. Although of recent manufacture,
previous to June 1851, they were apparently doing service on a road in
Norwich, Connecticut. It
[247]
should be mentioned that both Smith and Tyler
were formerly associated with the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and
they probably learned of these two engines through this former
association. It is possible that the engines were purchased from
Wilmarth by the Cumberland Valley road, which had bought several other
locomotives from Wilmarth in previous years. It was the practice of at
least one other New England engine builder, the Taunton Locomotive
Works, to manufacture engines on the speculation that a buyer would be
found; if no immediate buyers appeared the engine was leased to a local
road until a sale was made.[6]

Regarding the Jenny Lind and Pioneer, Smith reported[7] to the Board
of Managers at their meeting of March 17, 1852:


The small tank engines which were purchased last year &#8230; and
which I spoke in a former report as undergoing at that time some
necessary improvements have since that time been fairly tested
as to their capacity to run our passenger trains and proved to
be equal to the duty.

The improvements proposed to be made have been completed only on
one engine [Jenny Lind] which is now running regularly with
passenger trains&mdash;the cost of repairs and improvements on this
engine (this being the one accidentally broken on the trial)
amounted to $476.51. The other engine is now in the shop, not
yet ready for service but will be at an early day.

The Pioneer and Jenny Lind achieved such success in action that the
president of the road, Frederick Watts, commented on their performance
in the annual report of the Cumberland Valley Railroad for 1851. Watts
stated that since their passenger trains were rarely more than a baggage
car and two coaches, the light locomotives &ldquo;&#8230; have been found to be
admirably adapted to our business.&rdquo; The Cumberland Valley Railroad,
therefore, added two more locomotives of similar design in the next few
years. These engines were the Boston and the Enterprise, also built
by Wilmarth in 1854-1855.

Watts reported the Pioneer and Jenny Lind cost $7,642. A standard
8-wheel engine cost about $6,500 to $8,000 each during this period. In
recent years, the Pennsylvania Railroad has stated the Pioneer cost
$6,200 in gold, but is unable to give the source for this information.
The author can discount this statement for it does not seem reasonable
that a light, cheap engine of the pattern of the Pioneer could cost as
much as a machine nearly twice its size.

Service History of the Pioneer


After being put in service, the Pioneer continued to perform well and
was credited as able to move a 4-car passenger train along smartly at 40
mph.[8] This tranquility was shattered in October 1862 by a raiding
party led by Confederate General J. E. B. Stuart which
[251]
burned the Chambersburg shops of the Cumberland Valley Railroad. The Pioneer,
Jenny Lind, and Utility were partially destroyed. The Cumberland
Valley Railroad in its report for 1862 stated:

The Wood-shop, Machine-shop, Black-smith-shop,
Engine-house, Wood-sheds, and Passenger Depot were totally consumed,
and with the Engine-house three second-class Engines were much injured
by the fire, but not so destroyed but that they may be restored to
usefulness.

However, no record can be found of the extent or exact nature of the
damage. The shops and a number of cars were burned so it is reasonable
to assume that the cab and other wooden parts of the locomotive were
damaged. One unverified report in the files of the Pennsylvania Railroad
states that part of the roof and brick wall fell on the Pioneer during
the fire causing considerable damage. In June 1864 the Chambersburg
shops were again burned by the Confederates, but on this occasion the
railroad managed to remove all its locomotives before the raid. During
the Civil War, the Cumberland Valley Railroad was obliged to operate
longer passenger trains to satisfy the enlarged traffic. The Pioneer
and its sister single-axle engines were found too light for these trains
and were used only on work and special trains. Reference to table 1 will
show that the mileage of the Pioneer fell off sharply for the years
1860-1865.

The Pennsylvania Railroad claims a total mileage of

In 1871 the Pioneer was remodeled by A. S. Hull, master mechanic of
the railroad. The exact nature of the alterations cannot be determined,
as no drawings or photographs of the engine previous to this time are
known to exist. In fact, the drawing (fig.&nbsp;8) prepared by Hull in 1876
to show the engine as remodeled in 1871 is the oldest known illustration
of the Pioneer. Paul Westhaeffer, a lifelong student of Cumberland
Valley R. R. history, states that according to an interview with one of
Hull&rsquo;s descendants the only alteration made to the Pioneer during the
1871 &ldquo;remodeling&rdquo; was the addition of a handbrake. The road&rsquo;s annual
report of 1853 describes the Pioneer as a six-wheel tank engine. The
report of 1854 mentions that the Pioneer used link motion. These
statements are enough to give substance to the idea that the basic
arrangement has survived unaltered and that it has not been extensively
rebuilt, as was the Jenny Lind in 1878.

By the 1870&rsquo;s, the Pioneer was too light for the heavier cars then in
use and by 1880 it had reached the end of its usefulness for regular
service. After nearly thirty years on the road it had run 255,675 miles.
Two new passenger locomotives were purchased in 1880 to handle the
heavier trains. In 1881 the Pioneer was dropped from the roster, but
was used until about 1890 for work trains. After this time it was stored
in a shed at Falling Spring, Pennsylvania, near the Chambersburg yards
of the C.V.R.R.

Mechanical Description of the Pioneer




Figure 11.&mdash;&ldquo;Pioneer,&rdquo; about 1901, scene unknown. (Photo

After the early 1840&rsquo;s the single-axle locomotive, having one pair of
driving wheels, was largely
[252]
superseded by the 8-wheel engine. The
desire to operate longer trains and the need for engines of greater
traction to overcome the steep grades of American roads called for
coupled driving wheels and machines of greater weight than the 4&mdash;2&mdash;0.
After the introduction of the 4&mdash;4&mdash;0, the single-axle engine received
little attention in this country except for light service or such
special tasks as inspection or dummy engines.




Figure 12.&mdash;The
&ldquo;Pioneer&rdquo;

There was, however, a renewed interest in &ldquo;singles&rdquo; in the early 1850&rsquo;s
because of W. B. Adams&rsquo; experiments with light passenger locomotives in
England. In 1850 Adams built a light single-axle tank locomotive for the
Eastern Counties Railway which proved very economical for light
passenger traffic. It was such a success that considerable interest in
light locomotives was generated in this country as well as in England.
Nearly 100 single-axle locomotives were built in the United States
between about 1845-1870. These engines were built by nearly every
well-known maker, from Hinkley in Boston to the Vulcan Foundry in San
Francisco. Danforth Cooke &amp; Co. of Paterson built a standard pattern
4&mdash;2&mdash;4 used by many roads. One of these, the C. P. Huntington,
survives to the present time.

The following paragraphs describe the mechanical details of the
Pioneer as it appears on exhibition in the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s
new Museum of History and Technology.


BOILER

The boiler is the most important and costly part of a steam locomotive,
representing one-fourth to one-third of the total cost. A poorly built
or designed boiler will produce a poor locomotive no matter how well
made the remainder of mechanism. The boiler of the Pioneer is of the
wagon-top, crownbar, fire-tube
[253]
style and is made of a 5/16-inch thick,
wrought-iron plate. The barrel is very small, in keeping with the size
of the engine, being only 27 inches in diameter. While some readers may
believe this to be an extremely early example of a wagon-top boiler, we
should remember that most New England builders produced few locomotives
with the Bury (dome) boiler and that the chief advocates of this later
style were the Philadelphia builders. By the early 1850&rsquo;s the Bury
boiler passed out of favor entirely and the wagon top became the
standard type of boiler with all builders in this country.

Sixty-three iron tubes, 17/8 inches by 85 inches long are used. The
original tubes may have been copper or brass since these were easier to
keep tight than the less malleable iron tubes. The present tube sheet is
of iron but was originally copper. Its thickness cannot be conveniently
measured, but it is greater than that of the boiler shell, probably
about 1/2 to 5/8 inch. While copper tubes and tube sheets were not much
used in this country after about 1870, copper was employed as recently
as 1950 by Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorns, Ltd., on some small industrial
locomotives.

The boiler shell is lagged with wooden tongue-and-groove strips about
21/2 inches wide (felt also was used for insulation during this
period). The wooden lagging is covered with Russia sheet iron which is
held in place and the joints covered by polished brass bands. Russia
sheet iron is a planish iron having a lustrous, metallic gray finish.


Alba F. Smith

Alba F. Smith, the man responsible for the purchase of the Pioneer,
was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, June 28, 1817.[9] Smith showed promise
as a mechanic at an early age and by the time he was 22 had established
leadpipe works in Norwich. His attention was drawn particularly to
locomotives since the tracks of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad
passed his shop. His attempts to develop a spark arrester for
locomotives brought Smith to the favorable attention of Captain Daniel
Tyler (1799-1882), president of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad. When
Tyler was hired by the Cumberland Valley Railroad in 1850 to supervise
the line&rsquo;s rebuilding, he persuaded the managers of that road to hire
Smith as superintendent of machinery.[10] Smith was appointed as
superintendent of the machine shop of the Cumberland Valley Railroad on
July 22, 1850.[11] On January 1, 1851, he became superintendent of the
road.

In March of 1856 Smith resigned his position with the Cumberland Valley
Railroad and became superintendent of the Hudson River Railroad, where
he remained for only a year. During that time he designed the
coal-burning locomotive Irvington, rebuilt the Waterman condensing
dummy locomotive for use in hauling trains through city streets, and
developed a superheater.[12]

After retiring from the Hudson River Railroad he returned to Norwich and
became active in enterprises in that area, including the presidency of
the Norwich and Worcester Railroad. While the last years of Smith&rsquo;s life
were devoted to administrative work, he found time for mechanical
invention as well. In 1862 he patented a safety truck for locomotives,
and became president of a concern which controlled the most important
patents for such devices.[13] Alba F. Smith died on July 21, 1879, in
Norwich, Connecticut.

[BOILER continued]

The steam dome (fig.&nbsp;18) is located directly over the firebox, inside
the cab. It is lagged and jacketed in an identical manner to the boiler.
The shell of the dome is of 5/16-inch wrought iron, the top cap is a
cast-iron plate which also serves as a manhole cover offering access to
the boiler&rsquo;s interior for inspection and repair.

A round plate, 20 inches in diameter, riveted on the forward end of the
boiler, just behind the bell stand, was found when the old jacket was
removed in May 1963. The size and shape of the hole, which the plate
[258]
covers, indicate that a steam dome or manhole was located at this point.
It is possible that this was the original location of the steam dome
since many builders in the early 1850&rsquo;s preferred to mount the dome
forward of the firebox. This was done in the belief that there was less
danger of priming because the water was less agitated forward of the
firebox.

The firebox is as narrow as the boiler shell and fits easily between the
frame. It is a deep and narrow box, measuring 27 inches by 28 inches by
about 40 inches deep, and is well suited to burning wood. A deep firebox
was necessary because a wide, shallow box suitable for coal burning,
allowed the fuel to burn so quickly it was difficult to fire the engine
effectively. With the deep, narrow firebox, wood was filled up to the
level of the fire door. In this way, the fire did not burn so furiously
and did not keep ahead of the fireman; at the same time, since it burned
so freely, a good fire was always on hand. The Pioneer burned oak and
hickory.[14] For the firebox 5/16-inch thick sheet was used, for heavier
sheet would have blistered and flaked off because of the intense heat of
the fire and the fibrous quality of wrought-iron sheet of the period.
Sheet iron was fabricated from many small strips of iron rolled together
while hot. These strips were ideally welded into a homogeneous sheet,
but in practice it was found the thicker the sheet the less sure the
weld.

The fire grates are cast iron and set just a few inches above the bottom
of the water space so that the water below the grates remains less
turbulent and mud or other impurities in the water settle here. Four
bronze mud plugs and a blowoff cock are fitted to the base of the
firebox so that the sediment thus collected can be removed
(figs. 17, 18).

The front of the boiler is attached to the frame by the smokebox, which
is a cylinder, bolted on a light, cast-iron saddle (not part of the
cylinder castings nor attached to them, but bolted directly to the top
rail of the frame; it may be a hastily made repair put on at the shops
of the C.V.R.R.). The rear of the boiler is attached to the frame by two
large cast-iron brackets, one on each side of the firebox
(fig.&nbsp;18).
These are bolted to the top rail of the frame but the holes in the
brackets are undoubtedly slotted, so that they may slide since the
boiler will expand about 1/4 inch when heated. In addition to the crown
bars, which strengthen the crown sheet, the boiler is further
strengthened by stay bolts and braces located in the wagon top over the
firebox, where the boiler had been weakened by the large hole necessary
for the steam dome. This boiler is a remarkably light, strong, and
compact structure.


BOILER FITTINGS

Few boiler fittings are found on the Pioneer and it appears that
little was done to update the engine with more modern devices during its
many years of service. With the exception of the steam gauge, it has no
more boiler fitting than when it left the builder&rsquo;s shop in 1851.




Figure 19.&mdash;Backhead of the Pioneer. (Smithsonian photo
48069F.)


The throttle valve is a simple slide valve and must have been primitive
for the time, for the balance-poppet throttle valve was in use in this
country previous to 1851. It is located directly below the steam dome
even though it was common practice to place the throttle valve at the
front of the boiler in the smokebox. Considering the cramped condition
inside the smokebox, there would seem to be little space for the
addition of the throttle valve; hence its present location. The dry pipe
projects up into the steam dome to gather the hottest, driest steam for
the cylinders. The inverted, funnel-like cap on the top of the dry pipe
is to prevent priming, as drops of water may travel up the sides of the
pipe and then to the cylinders, with the possibility of great damage.
After the steam enters the throttle valve it passes through the front
end of the valve, through the top of the boiler via the dry pipe
(fig.&nbsp;18), through the front tube sheet, and then to the cylinders via the
petticoat pipes. The throttle lever is a simple arrangement readily
understood from the drawings. It has no latch and the throttle lever is
held in any desired setting by the wingnut and quadrant shown in figure
18. The water level in the boiler is indicated by the three brass cocks
located on the backhead. No gauge glass is used; they were not employed
in this country until the 1870&rsquo;s, although they were commonly used in
England at the time the Pioneer was built.

While two safety valves were commonly required, only one was used on the
Pioneer. The safety valve is located on top of the steam dome.
Pressure is exerted on the lever by a spring balance, fixed at the
forward end by a knife-blade bearing. The pressure can be adjusted by
the thumbscrew on the balance. The graduated scale on the balance gave a
general but uncertain indication of the boiler pressure. The valve
itself is a poppet held against the face of the valve seat by a second
knife blade attached to the
[259]
lever. The ornamental column forming the
stand of the safety valve is cast iron and does much to decorate the
interior of the cab. The pipe carrying the escaping steam projects
through the cab roof. It is made of copper with a decorative brass band.
This entire mechanism was replaced by a modern safety valve for use at
the Chicago Railroad Fair (1949). Fortunately, the old valve was
preserved and has since been replaced on the engine.


The steam gauge is a later addition, but could have been put on as early
as the 1860&rsquo;s, since the most recent patent date that it bears is 1859.
It is an Ashcroft gauge having a handsome 4&mdash;4&mdash;0 locomotive engraved on
its silver face.

The steam jet (item 3, fig.&nbsp;18) is one of the simplest yet most notable
boiler fitting of the Pioneer, being nothing more than a valve tapped
into the base of the steam dome with a line running under the boiler
jacket to the smokestack. When the valve is opened a jet of steam goes
up the stack, creating a draft useful for starting the fire or
enlivening it as necessary. This device was the invention of Alba F.
Smith in 1852, according to the eminent 19th-century technical writer
and engineer Zerah Colburn.[15]

The two feedwater pumps (fig.&nbsp;20) are located beneath the cab deck
(1, fig.&nbsp;17). They are cast-iron construction and are driven by an eccentric
on the driving-wheel axle (fig.&nbsp;27). The
airchamber or dome (1, fig.&nbsp;27)
imparts a more steady flow of the water to the boiler by equalizing the
surges of water from the reciprocating pump plunger. A steam line
(3, fig.&nbsp;18), which heats the pump and prevents freezing in cold weather, is
regulated by a valve in the cab (figs. 18, 27). Note that the line on
the right side of the cab has been disconnected and plugged.

The eccentric drive for the pumps is unusual, and the author knows of no
other American locomotive so equipped. Eastwick and Harrison, it is
true, favored an eccentric drive for feed pumps, but they mounted the
eccentric on the crankpin of the rear driving wheel and thus produced in
effect a half-stroke pump. This was not an unusual arrangement, though a
small crank was usually employed in place of the eccentric. The
full-stroke crosshead pump with which the Jenny Lind
(fig.&nbsp;22) is
equipped, was of course the most common style of feed pump used in this
country in the 19th century.

Of all the mechanisms on a 19th-century locomotive, the feed pump was
the most troublesome. If an engineer could think of nothing else to
complain about, he could usually call attention to a defective pump and
not be found a liar. Because of this, injectors were adopted after their
introduction in 1860. It is surprising that the Pioneer, which was in
regular service as late as 1880 and has been under
steam many times
since for numerous exhibitions, was never fitted with one of these
devices. Because its stroke is
[260]
short and the plunger is in less rapid
motion, the present eccentric arrangement is more complex but less prone
to disorder than the simpler but faster crosshead pump.


Seth Wilmarth

Little is known of the builder of the Pioneer, Seth Wilmarth, and
nothing in the way of a satisfactory history of his business is
available. For the reader&rsquo;s general interest the following information
is noted.[16]

Seth Wilmarth was born in Brattleboro, Vermont, on September 8, 1810. He
is thought to have learned the machinist trade in Pawtucket, Rhode
Island, before coming to Boston and working for the Boston Locomotive
Works, Hinkley and Drury proprietors. In about 1836 he opened a machine
shop and, encouraged by an expanding business, in 1841 he built a new
shop in South Boston which became known as the Union Works.
[17] Wilmarth
was in the general machine business but his reputation was made in the
manufacture of machine tools, notably lathes. He is believed to have
built his first locomotive in 1842, but locomotive building never became
his main line of work. Wilmarth patterned his engines after those of
Hinkley and undoubtedly, in common with the other New England builders
of this period, favored the steady-riding, inside-connection engines.
The &ldquo;Shanghais,&rdquo; so-called because of their great height, built for the
Boston and Worcester Railroad by Wilmarth in 1849, were among the best
known inside-connection engines operated in this country
(fig.&nbsp;14).
While the greater part of Wilmarth&rsquo;s engines was built for New England
roads, many were constructed for lines outside that area, including the
Pennsylvania Railroad, Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Erie.

A comparison of the surviving illustrations of Hinkley and Wilmarth
engines of the 1850&rsquo;s reveals a remarkable similarity in their details
(figs. 14 and 15).
Notice particularly the straight boiler, riveted
frame, closely set truck wheels, feedwater pump driven by a pin on the
crank of the driving wheel, and details of the dome cover. All of the
features are duplicated exactly by both builders. This is not surprising
considering the proximity of the plants and the fact that Wilmarth had
been previously employed by Hinkley.

In 1854 Wilmarth was engaged by the New York and Erie Railroad to build
fifty 6-foot gauge engines.
[18] After work had been started on these
engines, and a large store of material had been purchased for their
construction, Wilmarth was informed that the railroad could not pay cash
but that he would have to take notes in payment.
[19] There was at this
time a mild economic panic and notes could be sold only at a heavy
discount. This crisis closed the Union Works. The next year, 1855, Seth
Wilmarth was appointed master mechanic of the Charlestown Navy Yard,
Boston, where he worked for twenty years. He died in Malden,
Massachusetts, on November 5, 1886.


[261]
[BOILER FITTINGS continued]




Figure 20.&mdash;Feedwater pump

The check valves are placed slightly below the centerline of the boiler
(fig.&nbsp;18). These valves are an unfinished bronze casting and appear to
be of a recent pattern, probably dating from the 1901 renovation. At the
time the engine was built, it was usual to house these valves in an
ornamental spun-brass casing. The smokestack is of the bonnet type
commonly used on wood-burning locomotives in this country between about
1845 and 1870. The exhaust steam from the cylinders is directed up the
straight stack (shown in phantom in fig.&nbsp;27) by the blast pipe. This
creates a partial vacuum in the smokebox that draws the fire, gases,
ash, and smoke through the boiler tubes from the firebox. The force of
the exhausting steam blows them out the stack. At the top of the
straight stack is a deflecting cone which slows the velocity of the
exhaust and changes its direction causing it to go down into the
funnel-shaped outer casing of the stack. Here, the heavy embers and
cinders are collected and prevented from directly discharging into the
countryside as dangerous firebrands. Wire netting is stretched overtop
of the deflecting cone to catch the lighter, more volatile embers which
may defy the action of the cone. The term &ldquo;bonnet stack&rdquo; results from
the fact that this netting is similar in shape to a lady&rsquo;s bonnet. The
cinders thus accumulated in the stack&rsquo;s hopper could be emptied by
opening a plug at the base of the stack.

While the deflecting cone was regarded highly as a spark arrester and
used practically to the exclusion of any other arrangement, it had the
basic defect of keeping the smoke low and close to the train. This was a
great nuisance to passengers, as the low trailing smoke blew into the
cars. If the exhaust had been allowed to blast straight out the stack
high into the air, most of the sparks would have burned out before
touching the ground.

FRAME

The frame of the Pioneer defies an exact classification but it more
closely resembles the riveted- or sandwich-type frame than any other
(figs. 18, 27). While the simple bar frame enjoyed the greatest
popularity in the last century, riveted frames were widely used in this
country, particularly by the New England builders between about 1840 and
1860. The riveted frame was fabricated from two plates of iron, about
5/8-inch thick, cut to the shape of the top rail and the pedestal. A bar
about 2 inches square was riveted between the two plates. A careful
study of photographs of Hinkley and other New England-built engines of
the period will reveal this style of construction. The frame of the
Pioneer differs from the usual riveted frame in that the top rail is
13/4 inches thick by 41/8 inches deep and runs the length of the
locomotive. The pedestals are made of two 3/8-inch plates flush-riveted
to each side of the top rail. The cast-iron shoes which serve as guides
for the journal boxes also act as spacers between the pedestal plates.

The bottom rail of the frame is a 11/8-inch diameter rod which is
forged square at the pedestals and forms the pedestal cap. The frame is
further stiffened by two diagonal rods running from the top of each
truck-wheel pedestal to the base of the driving-wheel pedestal, forming
a truss. Six rods, riveted to the boiler shell and bolted to the frame&rsquo;s
top rail, strengthen the frame laterally. Four of these rods can be seen
easily as they run from the frame to the middle of the boiler; the other
two are riveted to the underside of the boiler. The attachment of these
rods to the boiler was an undesirable practice, for the boiler shell
[264]
was thus subjected to the additional strain of the locomotive&rsquo;s
vibrations as it passed over the road. In later years, as locomotives
grew in size, this practice was avoided and frames were made
sufficiently strong to hold the engine&rsquo;s machinery in line without using
the boiler shell.

The front and rear frame beams are of flat iron plate bolted to the
frame. The rear beam had been pushed in during an accident, and instead
of its being replaced, another plate was riveted on and bent out in the
opposite direction to form a pocket for the rear coupling pin. Note that
there is no drawbar and that the coupler is merely bolted to the beams.
Since the engine only pulled light trains, the arrangement was
sufficiently strong.


RUNNING GEAR

The running gear is simply sprung with individual leaf springs for each
axle; it is not connected by equalizing levers. To find an American
locomotive not equipped with equalizers is surprising since they were
almost a necessity to produce a reasonably smooth ride on the rough
tracks of American railroads. Equalizers steadied the motion of the
engine by distributing the shock received by any one wheel or axle to
all the other wheels and axles so connected, thus minimizing the effects
of an uneven roadbed. The author believes that the Pioneer is a
hard-riding engine.

The springs of the main drives are mounted in the usual fashion. The
rear boiler bracket (fig.&nbsp;18) is slotted so that the spring hanger may
pass through for its connection with the frame. The spring of the
leading wheels is set at right angles to the frame (fig.&nbsp;27) and bears
on a beam, fabricated of iron plate, which in turn bears on the journal
boxes. The springs of the trailing wheels are set parallel with the
frame and are mounted between the pedestal plates (fig.&nbsp;18).

The center of the driving wheel is cast iron and has spokes of the old
rib pattern, which is a T in cross section, and was used previous to the
adoption of the hollow spoke wheel. In the mid-1830&rsquo;s Baldwin and others
used this rib-pattern style of wheel, except that the rib faced inside.
The present driving-wheel centers are unquestionably original. The
sister engine Jenny Lind (fig.&nbsp;22) was equipped with identical driving
wheels. The present tires are very thin and beyond their last turning.
They are wrought iron and shrunk to fit the wheel centers. Flush rivets
are used for further security. The left wheel, shown in figure 17, is
cracked at the hub and is fitted with an iron ring to prevent its
breaking.

The truck wheels, of the hollow spoke pattern, are cast iron with
chilled treads. They were made by Asa Whitney, one of the leading
car-wheel manufacturers in this country, whose extensive plant was
located in Philadelphia. Made under Whitney&rsquo;s patent of 1866, these
wheels may well have been added to the Pioneer during the 1871
rebuilding. Railroad wheels were not cast from ordinary cast iron, which
was too weak and brittle to stand the severe service for which they were
intended, but from a high-quality cast iron similar to that used for
cannons. Its tensile strength, which ranged from 31,000 to 36,000 psi,
was remarkably high and very nearly approached that of the best
wrought-iron plate.

The cylinders are cast iron with an 81/2-inch bore about half the size
of the cylinders of a standard 8-wheel engine. The cylinders are bolted
to the frame but not to the saddle, and are set at a 9&deg; angle to clear
the leading wheels and at the same time to line up with the center of
the driving-wheel axle. The wood lagging is covered with a decorative
brass jacket. Ornamental brass jacketing was extensively used on
mid-19th-century American locomotives to cover not only the cylinders
but steam and sand boxes, check valves, and valve boxes. The greater
expense for brass (Russia iron or painted sheet iron were a cheaper
substitute) was justified by the argument that brass lasted the life of
the engine, and could be reclaimed for scrap at a price approaching the
original cost; and also that when brightly polished it reflected the
heat, preventing loss by radiation, and its bright surface could be seen
a great distance, thus helping to prevent accidents at grade crossings.
The reader should be careful not to misconstrue the above arguments
simply as rationalization on the part of master mechanics more intent on
highly decorative machines than on the practical considerations
involved.

The valve box, a separate casting, is fastened to the cylinder casting
by six bolts. The side cover plates when removed show only a small
opening suitable for inspection and adjustment of the valve. The valve
box must be removed to permit repair or removal of the valve. A better
understanding of this mechanism and the layout of the parts can be
gained from a study of figures 23-26, 28 (8, 8A, and 8B).

Both crossheads were originally of cast iron but one of these has been
replaced and is of steel. They run into steel guides, bolted at the
forward end to the rear cylinder head and supported in the rear by a
yoke. The yoke is one of the more finished and better made pieces on the
entire engine (fig.&nbsp;27). The main rod is of the old pattern, round in
cross section, and only 11/2 inches in diameter at the largest point.


VALVE GEAR

The valve gear is of the Stephenson shifting-link pattern
(see fig.&nbsp;27),
a simple and dependable motion used extensively in this country between
about 1850 and 1900. The author believes that this is the original valve
gear of the Pioneer, since the first mention (1854) in the Annual
Report of the Cumberland Valley Railroad of the style of valve gear
used by each engine, states that the Pioneer was equipped with a
shifting-link motion. Assuming this to be the original valve gear of the
Pioneer, it must be regarded as an early application, because the
Stephenson motion was just being introduced into American locomotive
practice in the early 1850&rsquo;s. Four eccentrics drive the motion; two are
for forward motion and two for reverse. The link is split and made of
two curved pieces. The rocker is fabricated of several forged pieces
keyed and bolted together. On better made engines the rocker would be a
one-piece forging. The lower arm of each rocker is curiously shaped,
made with a slot so that the link block may be adjusted. Generally, the
only adjustment possible was effected by varying the length of the valve
stem by the adjusting nuts provided. A simple weight and lever attached
to the reversing shaft serve as a counterbalance for the links and thus
assist the engineer in shifting the valve motion. There are eight
positions on the quadrant of the reversing lever.

Industries building, showing the tank and backhead. (Smithsonian photo

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

The cab is solid walnut with a natural finish. It is very possible that
the second cab was added to the locomotive after the 1862 fire. A brass
gong used by the
[267]
conductor to signal the engineer is fastened to the
underside of the cab roof. This style of gong was in use in the 1850&rsquo;s
and may well be original equipment.

The water tank is in two sections, one part extending below the deck,
between the frame. The tank holds 600 gallons of water. The tender holds
one cord of wood.

The small pedestal-mounted sandbox was used on several Cumberland Valley
engines including the Pioneer. This box was removed from the engine
sometime between 1901 and 1904. It was on the engine at the time of the
Carlisle sesquicentennial but disappeared by the time of the St. Louis
exposition. Two small sandboxes, mounted on the driving-wheel splash
guards, replaced the original box. The large headlamp (fig.&nbsp;3)
apparently disappeared at the same time and was replaced by a crudely
made lamp formerly mounted on the cab roof as a backup light. Headlamps
of commercial manufacture were carefully finished and made with
parabolic reflectors,
elaborate burners, and handsomely fitted cases.
Such a lamp could throw a beam of light for 1000 feet. The present lamp
has a flat cone-shaped piece of tin for a reflector.

The brushes attached to the pilot were used in the winter to brush snow
and loose ice off the rail and thus improve traction. In good weather
the brushes were set up to clear the tracks.





Figure 30.&mdash;Reconstructed sandbox replaced on the
locomotive, August 1962. (Drawing by J. H. White.)


After the Pioneer had come to the National Museum, it was decided that
some refinishing was required to return it as nearly as possible to the
state of the original engine. Replacing the sandbox was an obvious
change.[20] The brass cylinder jackets were also replaced. The cab was
stripped and carefully refinished as natural wood. The old safety valve
was replaced, [268]as already mentioned. Rejacketing the boiler with
simulated Russia iron produced a most pleasing effect, adding not only
to the authenticity of the display but making the engine appear lighter
and relieving the somber blackness which was not characteristic of a
locomotive of the 1850&rsquo;s. Several minor replacements are yet to be done;
chiefly among these are the cylinder-cock linkage and a proper headlamp.

The question arises, has the engine survived as a true and accurate
representation of the original machine built in 1851? In answer, it can
be said that although the Pioneer was damaged en route to the
Cumberland Valley Railroad, modified on receipt, burned in 1862, and
operated for altogether nearly 40 years, surprisingly few new appliances
have been added, nor has the general arrangement been changed.
Undoubtedly, the main reason the engine is so little changed is that its
small size and odd framing did not invite any large investment for
extensive alteration for other uses. But there can be no positive answer
as to its present variance from the original appearance as represented
in the oldest known illustration of it&mdash;the Hull drawing of 1871
(fig.&nbsp;8). There are few, if any, surviving
19th-century locomotives that have
not suffered numerous rebuildings and are not greatly altered from the
original. The John Bull, also in the U.S. National Museum collection,
is a good example of a machine many times rebuilt in its 30 years of
service.[21] Unless other information is uncovered to the contrary, it
can be stated that the Pioneer is a true representation of a light
passenger locomotive of 1851.

HISTORY of the DIVISION of MEDICAL SCIENCES

In The Museum of History and Technology


  This paper traces, for the first time, the history of the
  Division of Medical Sciences in the Museum of History and
  Technology from its small beginnings as a section of materia
  medica in 1881 to its present broad scope. The original
  collection of a few hundred specimens of crude drugs which had
  been exhibited at the centennial exhibition of 1876 at
  Philadelphia, has now developed into the largest collection in
  the Western Hemisphere of historical objects related to the
  healing arts.

  The Author: Sami Hamarneh is the curator of the Division of
  Medical Sciences in the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s Museum of
  History and Technology.


By the
early 1870&rsquo;s, leading figures from both the health professions
and the general public had begun to realize the necessity for having the
medical sciences represented in the Smithsonian Institution. The impetus
behind this new feeling resulted from the action of a distinguished
American physician, philanthropist, and author, Joseph Meredith Toner
(1825-1896), and came almost a decade before the integration of a new
section concerned with research and the historical and educational
aspects of the healing arts in the Smithsonian Institution.

In 1872, Dr. Toner established the &ldquo;Toner Lectures&rdquo; to encourage efforts
towards discovering new truths &ldquo;for the advancement of medical science
&#8230; for the benefit of mankind.&rdquo; To finance these lectures, he provided
a fund worth approximately $3,000 to be administered by a board of
trustees consisting of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the
Surgeon General of the U.S. Navy, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army
(only in some years), and the president of the Medical Society of the
District of Columbia. The interest from this fund was to compensate
physicians and scholars who were to deliver &ldquo;at least two annual memoirs
or essays&rdquo; based on original research on some branch of the medical
sciences and containing information which had been verified &ldquo;by
experiments or observations.&rdquo;
[1]

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution agreed to have these
lectures published by the Institution in its Miscellaneous Collections.
The first lecture given by the Assistant Surgeon of the U.S. Army, &ldquo;On
the[272] Structure of Cancerous Tumors and the Mode in which Adjacent parts
are Invaded,&rdquo; deserves credit even by current standards of scientific
research.[2] Only 10 lectures were given between 1873 and 1890 (see
bibliography), despite the recommendation for at least two every
year.

  advancement of medical education and research. In 1873, Dr. Toner became
  president of the American Medical Association and, in 1874, he became
  president of the American Public Health Association. He was a physician
  to St. Joseph&rsquo;s Male Orphan Asylum and St. Ann&rsquo;s Infants&rsquo; Asylum in
  Washington, D.C. In addition, he was instrumental in establishing
  Providence Hospital in the District of Columbia. He also provided a
  workable plan for the American Medical Association&rsquo;s library in
  Washington, D.C. (1868-1871). Among his several publications are:
  Contributions to the Annals of Medical Progress and Medical Education
  in the United States before and during the War of Independence
  (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1874) and Medical Men of the
  Revolution (1876). In 1882, he donated his large library, consisting of
  44,000 books and pamphlets on topics related mainly to medicine and
  history, to the Library of Congress. (Photo courtesy of National
  Library of Medicine.)


A more direct factor, which not only contributed to the establishment of
a section on the healing arts, but also had a greater effect upon the
Smithsonian Institution than any other event since its founding, was the
1876 centennial exhibition in Philadelphia.

This magnificent international fair commemorated the hundredth
anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. The
finest exhibits of 30 foreign countries and various States of the Union
participating in the fair were finally donated to the Smithsonian
Institution as the official depository of historical and archeological
objects for this country. As a result, the Institution&rsquo;s collections
increased to an extent far beyond the capacity of the first Smithsonian
building. This led to the erection of the National Museum, known for the
last two decades and until date of publication as the Arts and
Industries building, which was completed on March 4, 1881, and was used
that evening for the inaugural reception of incoming President James A.
Garfield.




Section of Materia Medica (1881-1898)

Throughout the 19th century, the study of materia medica (dealing with
the nature and properties of
[273]
drugs of various kinds and origins, their
collection and mode of administration for the treatment of diseases, and
the medicinal utilization of animal products) held an increasingly
important place among the medical sciences. In the United States, as in
other civilized countries, this topic was greatly emphasized in the
curriculum of almost every school teaching the health professions.
Today, the subject matter contained in this branch of science is taught
under the heading of several specialized fields, such as pharmacology,
pharmacognosy, and drug analysis of various types. However, when the
decision was made in 1881 to promote greater knowledge and interest in
the healing arts by creating a section devoted to such pursuits in the
U.S. National Museum, the title of Section of Materia Medica was
adopted. Added to this, was the fact that the bulk of the first
collections received in the Section was a great variety of crude drugs,
which constituted much of the material then taught in the academic
courses of materia medica.

The new Section was included in the Department of Arts and Industries,
then under the curatorship of Assistant Director G. Brown Goode. From
its beginning and for two decades, however, the Section of Materia
Medica was sponsored and supervised by the U.S. Navy in cooperation with
the Smithsonian Institution. For this reason, the Navy decided not to
establish a similar bureau for a health museum as did the Army in
starting the Medical Museum (of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology)
in 1862 through the efforts of Dr. William Alexander Hammond. The
Smithsonian did, however, provide a clerk to relieve the curator of much
of the routine work. The Section&rsquo;s early vigorous activities were the
result of the ingenuity of the first honorary curator, Dr. James Milton
Flint (1838-1919), an Assistant Surgeon of the U.S. Navy. From the
establishment of the Section, in 1881, to 1912, Dr. Flint was curator
during separate periods for a total of nearly 25 years. For three of his
tenures (1881-1884; 1887-1891; 1895-1900), he was detailed to the
Smithsonian Institution by the Surgeon General of the U.S. Navy. During
the interim periods, other naval doctors were detailed as curators.
Finally, in 1900, Dr. Flint retired from the Navy with the rank of Rear
Admiral and volunteered to continue his services to the National Museum.
The proposal was gladly accepted and he continued as a curator until his
retirement from the Smithsonian Institution in 1912.

The Section commenced with a wealth of material. After the close of the
1876 centennial exhibition, its materia medica collection had been
stored with the other collections in a warehouse, awaiting an
appropriation by Congress for transfer and installation. This collection
was gradually brought into the new National Museum after that building&rsquo;s
completion in 1881. Many other materia medica specimens were
transferred from the Department of Agriculture. In addition to these
large collections of crude drugs, generous contributions came from
several prominent pharmaceutical firms such as Parke, Davis &amp; Company of
Detroit, Michigan; Wallace Brothers of Statesville, North Carolina; and
Schieffelin and Company of New York City. These manufacturing houses are
mentioned here because they and their agents abroad were the first to
take interest and donate to the Section, complete assortments of
contemporary remedial agents then in common use throughout the United
States and[274] Europe, besides many hundreds of &ldquo;rare and curious drugs.&rdquo; Thus, in spite of difficulties encountered from bringing several
collections into the building at one time, the materia medica
exhibition got off to a good start.

It was Dr. Flint, the first curator, who stated in 1883 that remedial
agents used by a nation or a community are as indicative of the degree
of their cultural development and standard of living as is the nature of
their food, the character of their dwellings, and their social and
religious traditions. Therefore, he felt that collections of drugs and
medical, surgical and pharmaceutical instruments and appliances should
not be thought of or designed as instructive to the specialist only, but
should also possess a general interest for the public. Because of these
objectives, Dr. Flint added, this section was conceived as a
departmental division for the collecting and exhibiting of objects
related to medicine, surgery, pharmacology, hygiene, and all material
related to the health field at large.
[4]

During his first term of curatorship (1881-1884), Dr. Flint devoted much
of his time to sorting, examining, identifying, and classifying the
materia medica specimens.
[5] In 1881, he issued a memorandum of
instructions to be followed by collectors of drugs and urged them to
give detailed and accurate information regarding acquired specimens so
that they might be &ldquo;more than mere museum curiosities.&rdquo; In addition, in
1883, he prepared a brief manual of classification of the materia
medica collection in the Museum as well as a useful, detailed catalog
of informational labels of the individual objects on exhibition. The
unpublished catalog is still the property of the Smithsonian Institution
Archives, Division of Medical Sciences&rsquo; Library.

It was Dr. Flint&rsquo;s ambition to obtain a comprehensive, worldwide
collection of all substances used as remedies. Then, in order to
identify drugs from foreign countries, he tried to collect illustrated
works on medical botany and printed pharmacopoeias of all nations having
them. He rightly defined an official pharmacopoeia as &ldquo;a book containing
directions for the identification and preparation of medicines prepared
and issued with the sanction of a government or organized and
authorized medical and pharmaceutical societies. Its purpose is to
establish uniformity in the nomenclature of remedies and in the
character and potency of the pharmaceutical preparations. It is enacted
by legislation, and thus becomes binding on all who prepare drugs or
sell them for medication.&rdquo; By soliciting the help of various American
consuls and Navy officers abroad, about 16 such official pharmacopoeias
were collected, making an almost complete international representation
of all available, official, drug standards. With these sources of
information, Dr. Flint compiled and arranged an international list of
materia medica specimens, indicating the authorized preparations of
each. By so doing, the first curator of this Section took the initiative
at least in proposing and, to some extent acting, on the preparation of
an international pharmacopoeia of drugs used in existing authorized
formularies giving &ldquo;official synonyms, and tables showing the
constituents and comparative strength of all preparations.&rdquo;
[6] This
undertaking is of special importance in the history of American
pharmacy, since it was probably the first attempt of its kind in the
United States.[7] In addition, colored plates and photographs of
medicinal plants were collected, forming the nucleus of the Division&rsquo;s
current collection of pictorial and photographic material related to the
history of the health field.

Dr. Flint also put on exhibition 630 Chinese materia medica specimens
from the 1876 Philadelphia centennial. These had been collected
originally by the Chinese Imperial Customs Commission for the centennial
and were subsequently given to this country.

[275]In 1881, the numbered objects in the Section&rsquo;s register amounted to
1,574 entries. In the following year, 1,590 more specimens were added,
most of them drugs in their crude state. By the end of 1883, the total
collection had reached 4,037, out of which 3,240 individual drugs in
good condition were classified and put on display. Of these, about 500
specimens with beautiful illustrations of parts of their original plants
had been mounted for exhibition. The drug exhibitions also included
materials transferred from the Department of Agriculture in 1881, which
originally had been brought from Central America and South America for
the 1876 centennial exhibition, a variety of opium specimens from
Turkey, and a number of rare drugs listed in the official formulary
which were acquired from the Museum of Karachi in what was then India.

Dr. Flint commented in the Smithsonian Annual Report for 1883 that the
collection of cinchona barks was especially complete. It was comprised
of specimens of nearly all the natural cinchona barks of South America
and every known variety of the cultivated product from the British
government plantations in India. In addition, there were specimens from
Java, Ceylon, Mexico, and Jamaica. The Indian and Jamaican barks were
accompanied by herbarium specimens of the leaf and flower (and, in some
cases, the fruit) of each variety of tree from which the bark was
obtained.[8]

In an attempt to protect specimens liable to attack by insects, a small
piece of blotting paper moistened with chloroform was inserted
underneath the stopper in each bottle. Later on, bichloride of mercury
was found to be a better insecticide.

These early collections of the Section were brought into admirable
condition and received compliments for their organization and
completeness. In the Smithsonian Annual Report for 1883, the
collections were praised as &ldquo;superior to any other in the United States
and scarcely excelled by any in Europe.&rdquo;

In spite of the apparent emphasis on the displaying of drugs, the first
curator of the Section had envisioned that the exhibits eventually would
embrace the entire field of the healing arts. In the Smithsonian Annual
Report for 1883, Dr. Flint noted that &ldquo;in the establishment of a museum
designed to illustrate man and his environment, it is proper that the
materials and methods used for the prevention and cure of disease should
have a place.&rdquo; However, his plans were temporarily interrupted when his
first term as honorary curator ended in 1884.

On June 4, 1884, Dr. Henry Gustav Beyer was detailed by the Department
of the Navy to become the second honorary curator of the Section of
Materia Medica. As a young man, Dr. Beyer (1850-1918) had come from
Saxony, Germany, to the United States and, in due course, became a
naturalized citizen. He[276] was graduated from the Bellevue Hospital
Medical College of New York City in 1876.

Because of his interest in physiological experimental research, Dr.
Beyer enrolled at the Johns Hopkins University, where he was awarded a
Ph. D. degree in 1887. Unlike his predecessor, Dr. Beyer was primarily
interested in carrying on research on the physiological action of
certain drugs and in pharmacology. This was evident from the original
scientific papers mentioned in the Smithsonian Annual Reports and
published by him during the period of his curatorship from 1884 to 1887.

Despite the pressure of his postgraduate studies at Johns Hopkins
University, Dr. Beyer helped in arranging and classifying the materia medica collection without trying to extend materially the scope of the
Section.

After the term of Dr. Beyer expired in 1887, Dr. Flint returned to take
charge of the Section. Surprisingly, at this time, it seems that he
showed less enthusiasm and devotion to the work of the Museum which he
had previously served so well. It could have been a disappointment
resulting from a lack of evidence of any real progress in the Section
since he had left it three years before. Whatever the reasons may have
been, the Smithsonian Annual Reports show that only a few hundred
specimens were added to the materia medica collections between 1887
and 1890, bringing the total to 5,915 preserved in good condition.
Further curtailment of the Section&rsquo;s activities began in November 1891
when Dr. Flint was again transferred to other duties for the U.S. Navy.
From November 1891 to May 24, 1895, curatorship of the Section was
charged to five physicians of the U.S. Navy: Drs. John C. Boyd (from
November 1891 to April 6, 1892); William S. Dixon (April 1892 to January
5, 1893); C. H. White (January 1893 to July 15, 1893); C. U. Gravatt
(July 1893 to January 22, 1894); R. A. Marmion (January 22, 1894 to June
15, 1894); and to Medical Inspector Daniel McMurtrie (June 1894 to May
24, 1895). During this interim of nearly three and a half years, there
were neither literary contributions nor additions made to the
collections of the Section that were of any significance. The reason is
obvious, for all of these curators averaged less than seven months of
service which is not enough time, even for a well-trained individual, to
accomplish very much in a museum. Therefore, it is easy to imagine that
when the Secretary of the Navy detailed Dr. Flint for a third time to
take charge of the Section, he was rather discouraged. Nevertheless, at
the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, from
September 18 to December 31, 1895, the materia medica was represented
by two displays: one on mineral waters and amounts of solid constituents
in pure state; and another showing the quantities of minerals after
analysis of the composition of the human body.

A similar project was undertaken in 1897 at the Tennessee Centennial
Exposition (May 1 to October 31) in Nashville, where there were two
displays of materia medica. One showed several kinds of the cinchona
barks and the medicinal preparations made from them, and another
containing the commercial varieties of the alkaloids of opium.

At this time, Dr. Flint&rsquo;s attention turned to a new phase of medical
exhibition. He felt the need for a program of exhibits on the practice
and the historical development of the healing arts. A change of the
Section&rsquo;s name was deemed necessary and, thus, in 1898 the more
comprehensive title of Division of Medicine was adopted.




Division of Medicine (1898-1939)

The statement by L. Emmett Holt of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical
Research, that before 1906, the Smithsonian Institution was never a
beneficiary to medicine in any form,[9] is not entirely applicable. The
previous discussion has clearly shown that the U.S. National Museum&rsquo;s
cooperation with the Navy contributed materially towards encouraging and
promoting medical knowledge. Furthermore, Dr. Flint tried to bring many
of his plans for this medical division of the Museum to a practical
fulfillment. He devised a program for presenting medical history in a
way which would be of interest both to the public and to the profession.
In order to best illustrate the history of the healing art, he divided
his subject matter into five provisional classifications according to
the Report upon the Condition and Progress of the U.S. National Museum
during 1898:


  1. Magical medicine including exorcism, amulets, talismans,
  fetishes and incantation;

  2. Psychical medicine including faith cures, and hypnotism;[277]

  3. Physical and external medicine including baths, exercise,
  electricity, massage, surgery, cautery, and blood-letting;

  4. Internal medicine including medications and treatment used by
  the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Hindus, Arabians, and Chinese;
  and

  5. Preventive medicine including beverages, food, soil, clothing
  and habitation.


It is certainly to Dr. Flint&rsquo;s credit that from its early conception,
first as Section of Materia Medica and thereafter as Division of
Medicine, he planned for an all-embracing exhibition and reference
collection of the medical sciences. Until the end of the 19th century
and the early years of the 20th century, crude drugs as well as
primitive and magic medicine held a more prominent place than medical
instruments in the exhibits and collections. In 1905, Flint issued his
last, known, literary contribution, &ldquo;Directions for Collecting
Information and Objects Illustrating the History of Medicine,&rdquo; in Part S
of Bulletin of the U.S. National Museum, no. 39. The emphasis he put
upon this shows Dr. Flint&rsquo;s interest in collecting medical and
pharmaceutical objects and equipment of historical value. Consequently,
he arranged new exhibits including one on American Indian medicine. A
medical historian, Fielding H. Garrison, inspected these about 1910 and,
in his &ldquo;An Introduction to the History of Medicine,&rdquo; wrote of their
novelty and appeal. &ldquo;In the interesting exhibit of folk medicine in the
National Museum at Washington,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;a buckeye or horse
chestnut (Aesculus flavus), an Irish potato, a rabbit&rsquo;s foot, a
leather strap previously worn by a horse, and a carbon from an arc light
are shown as sovereign charms against rheumatism. Other amulets in the
Washington exhibit,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;are the patella of a sheep and a ring
made out of a coffin nail (dug out of a graveyard) for cramps and
epilepsy, a peony root to be carried in the pocket against insanity, and
rare and precious stones for all and sundry diseases.&rdquo; It had been Dr.
Flint&rsquo;s intention, besides presenting an educational display on the
history of the medical arts, to warn the public against the perils of
quackery and the faults of folk medicine, as well as to expose evils in
drug adulteration. Today, we can see actual fulfillment of these
intentions in the present exhibit at the medical gallery which has been
executed recently on the basis of scientific, historical research.

After Dr. Flint&rsquo;s retirement from the Smithsonian Institution in 1912,
there was no replacement for over five years. Therefore, the Division
of Medicine was placed, for administrative purposes, under the
supervision of the curator of the newly reestablished (1912) Division of
Textiles, Frederick L. Lewton. During these years, he fought against the
dispersal of the medical and materia medica collections. Thus, for
lack of a curator of its own, almost all new activities in the Division
of Medicine were curtailed until 1917.

On January 31, 1917, Lewton addressed members of the American
Pharmaceutical Association inviting them to cooperate in gathering up
and preserving at the National Museum the &ldquo;many unique and irreplaceable
objects&rdquo; connected with the early history of pharmacy in this country
which could still be saved.[10] Then, on March 14, 1917, an examination
was announced by the Civil Service (held May 2) for an assistant curator
for the Division of Medicine, and the position was filled by Joseph
Donner on August 16, 1917. Donner was the first full-time employee paid
by the Smithsonian Institution for the curatorship of this Division. He
held the post until January 31, 1918, when he was inducted into the
Sanitary Corps of the United States Army. No significant activities in
the Division of Medicine were reported during these few months.

Mr. Donner was followed by a second, full-time, museum officer who
promoted a great amount of good will towards the Division during his
curatorship of a little over 30 years. Dr. Charles Whitebread
(1877-1963), the first pharmacist to head the Division, joined the
Smithsonian in 1918 and remained until his retirement in 1948, the
longest service, thus far, of any individual in the Division.

Dr. Whitebread received his degree of Doctor of Pharmacy from the School
of Pharmacy at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., in
1911. He entered government service late in 1915, but it was not until
April 2, 1918, that he agreed to become assistant curator of the
Division of Medicine.

Curator Whitebread&rsquo;s first year was an active and challenging one, for
in this new position he began to develop a deep interest in the history
of the healing arts. He made a number of important acquisitions, most of
them pertaining to pharmaceutical products, synthetic chemicals and
crude drugs. He found that many specimens from the older drug
collections had deteriorated to such an extent as to be worthless, and
he began replacing them with freshly marketed drugs.[278]

  admiration, five drug containers from the Squibb collection (1945).

Plans were completed for the opening of new medical exhibits and
adopting, with some modifications and additions, earlier classifications
set by Dr. Flint. Dr. Whitebread grouped these into the following
classes: the evaluation of the healing arts; a picture display of
medical men prominent in American history;[11] a materia medica
display including the history of pharmacy; and an exhibition on
Sanitation and Public Hygiene[12] which was later to evolve into the
Hall of Health.

In 1920, Dr. Whitebread added a number of specimens of medical-dosage
forms and pharmaceutical preparations to the Division&rsquo;s collections. He
also acquired other gifts to complete existing exhibits illustrating the
basic principles of the various schools of medicine, such as homeopathy
and osteopathy&mdash;their methods, tools, and ways of thought.

In 1921, a tablet machine by the Arthur Colton Company of Detroit,
Michigan, was acquired, and an exhibit illustrating vaccine and serum
therapy was installed in the medical gallery. This was followed, in
1922, by a collection arranged to tell the story of the prevention and
cure of specific diseases by means of biological remedies.

During the following two years, two more exhibits related to hospital
supplies and sanitation were added to the rapidly developing Hall of
Health exhibition which was opened in 1924. A third exhibit in 1925
consisted of 96 mounted color transparencies illustrating services
provided by hospitals to promote public health. Plans for the further
development of the Hall of Health continued during 1926, and contacts
were made with organizations interested in the educational aspects of
the healing arts. As a result, several new exhibits were added. In 1926,
the American Optometric Association helped in the installation of an
exhibit on conservation of vision or the care of the eyes under the
slogan &ldquo;Save your vision,&rdquo; as a phase of health work. Other exhibits in
the Hall at this time were: what parasites are; water pollution and how
to obtain pure water; waste disposal; ventilation and healthy housing,
and the importance of recreation; purification of milk and how to obtain
pure milk; transmission of diseases by insects and animals; how life
begins; prenatal and postnatal care and preschool care; duties of the
public health nurse; and social, oral and mental hygiene.

With the acquiring of more medical appliances and the widening of the
scope of the exhibits, more and more space was needed, and attention was
turned to the area of the medical gallery which had been occupied by the
materia medica collection for almost four decades. To gain more
exhibit space, it was decided that the greater part of the crude drugs
should be removed from the exhibits and be kept as a reference
collection and for research.[13]

In 1926, original patent models including those related to pharmacy,
medicine, and dentistry, were transferred from the U.S. Patent Office to
the National Museum. These patent models, together with other apothecary
tools and the machines used in drug production took up most of the
available space. This unfortunate situation led Dr. Whitebread to turn
down significant medical and pharmaceutical collections offered the
Museum between 1927 and 1930. Since the patent models were devised for
inventions designed to simplify the practice of the health professions,
three cases of these models were displayed in the medical gallery in the
early 1930&rsquo;s. Other exhibits shown during this decade included the
deception of folk medicine with warnings against superstitions, and an
exhibition on osteopathy,[14] as well as dioramas on the manufacture of
medicines and their use in scientific medical treatment.

In the meantime, Dr. Whitebread was an active contributor to the
literature of the health field in various periodicals, as well as in
pamphlets issued by the Museum and other governmental agencies (see
bibliography). His literary contributions, guided by the exhibits he
designed and the collections he acquired, were focused on the Division&rsquo;s
collections, such as primitive and psychic medicine and warnings against
reliance on magic and superstitions in treatment, medical oddities, and
the utilization of drugs of animal origin, both past and present.




Division of Medicine and Public Health (1939-1957)

After taking charge of the Division of Medicine in 1918, Dr. Whitebread
gave special attention to public health displays. His activities in this
area were accelerated after 1924 when the health exhibit at the
[282]Smithsonian Institution was inaugurated. As the exhibits in this field
increased, the Division, in 1939, took the more comprehensive title of
Division of Medicine and Public Health. Also, in 1939, Dr. Whitebread
was promoted to the rank of associate curator.

[283]

  Figure 10.&mdash;An exhibit on superstitions, empiricism,
  magic, and faith healing in the light of scientific medicine, completed

He continued his efforts to collect more specimens of interest to
medical history and to contribute to the literature. Among exhibited
specimens in 1941 were a powder paper-crimping machine, a portable drug
crusher, an odd device for spreading plaster on cloth, a pill-coating
apparatus, various suppository molds, a lozenge cutter, and an ingenious
Seidlitz powder machine. The derivation of medicinal drugs from animal,
vegetable, and mineral sources was also depicted, as were synthetic
materials and their intermediates. Basic prescription materials were
displayed, and rows of glass-enclosed cases held samples of crude
botanical drugs from almost every part of the globe with explanatory
cards giving brief, concise descriptions. The exhibition provided
medical and pharmaceutical students about to take state-board
examinations, the opportunity to study the subject in detail, especially
the enormous collection of materia medica samples.[15] Also in 1941,
Eli Lilly and Company donated an exhibit on the medical treatment of
various types of anemia. In the same year, a diorama including a
hypochlorinator for purification of water on a farm was installed in the
gallery. In 1942, the first Emerson iron lung (developed in 1931 by John
Haven Emerson) for artificial respiration was acquired by the Division.
The Division acquired, in 1944, the first portable x-ray machine known
to have been operated successfully on the battlefield, as well as other
x-ray equipment and early medicine chests.

Without a doubt, the most outstanding accession in the field of
pharmaceutical history during Dr. Whitebread&rsquo;s years of service was the
acquisition of the E. R. Squibb and Sons old apothecary shop. Most of
the baroque fixtures, including the stained-glass windows with
Hessian-Nassau coats of arms and wrought-iron frames, were part of the
mid-18th-century cathedral pharmacy &ldquo;M&uuml;nster Apotheke&rdquo; in Freiburg im
Breisgau, Germany. It was offered for sale in September 1930 by Dr. Jo
Mayer of Wiesbaden, Germany, who was an enthusiastic collector of
antiques, especially those related to the health professions. Earlier
that year, a historian of pharmacy and chemistry, Fritz Ferchl of
Mittenwald, Germany, had published a series of scholarly and informative
articles on the Meyer collection in which the outstanding specimens were
beautifully portrayed and thoroughly described (see bibliography).

As a result of Dr. Mayer&rsquo;s efforts to sell his collection, the impact of
Ferchl&rsquo;s illustrated articles, and the uniqueness of the collection, E.
R. Squibb and Sons purchased it in 1932 and brought it to the United
States &ldquo;with the thought that it would provide for American pharmacy,
its teachers and students, a museum illuminating the history, growth,
and development of pharmacy, its interesting background and struggle
through the ages.&rdquo; It was displayed at the Century of Progress
exposition held in Chicago during 1933 and 1934; subsequently, it was
assembled in the Squibb Building in New York City as a private museum
where, for about 10 years, it was visited by many interested in
pharmacy, ceramics, and art. Charles H. LaWall, who was originally
engaged to prepare a descriptive catalog on the exhibit, gave it the
title &ldquo;The Squibb Ancient Pharmacy.&rdquo;

Late in 1943, E. R. Squibb and Sons offered the collection as a gift to
the American Pharmaceutical Association if the latter would provide
museum space
[286]
for it. The offer was accepted, but the Association
finally found it difficult to spare the needed space for the collection
and decided to take up the matter with the U.S. National Museum.


  
  
  Figure 14.&mdash;This early exhibit on osteopathy was
  renovated several times prior to the early 1940&rsquo;s. (Smithsonian photo 19250.)


At this point, it should be stated that since 1883 the members of the
American Pharmaceutical Association have been keenly interested in
having the National Museum serve as the custodian for all collected
objects and records of historical interest to pharmacy. In 1944, the
Association officially offered to deposit on permanent loan, the
Squibb&rsquo;s pharmacy collection in the Smithsonian Institution with the
understanding that a suitable place would be provided for prompt and
permanent display. The offer was accepted, and during April and May of
1945, the entire collection was transferred to the Smithsonian
Institution, and construction to recreate the original two rooms for the
old, 18th-century, European &ldquo;Apotheke&rdquo; was underway.

By August 1946, the exhibit was completed. In the large room where the
pharmacist met his customers, the shelves were filled with 15th- to
19th-century, European pharmaceutical antiques. These included
Renaissance mortars; 16th- and 17th-century nested weights; beautiful
Italian, French, Swiss, and German majolica and faience drug jars; Dutch
and English delft; drug containers made of flint or opal glass with
fused-enamel labels with alchemical symbols; rare, 16th-century, wooden
drug containers, each with the coat of arms of the city in which each
was made; and two glass-topped, display tables contained franchises
issued and signed by Popes or state rulers, medical edicts,
dispensatories, herbals, pharmacopoeias, and pharmaceutical utensils.

On the walls in the small laboratory room, which also had been used as a
workshop and a study, were a stuffed crocodile, shark&rsquo;s head, tortoise,
fish, and salamander, parts of which were utilized as remedial agents.
Their presence provided tangible evidence that the pharmacy dispensed
genuine drugs and not substitutes.

The pharmaceutical profession in this country hailed the outstanding
exhibition, and the November 1946 issue of the
[287]
Journal of the American Pharmaceutical
Association, Practical Pharmacy Edition, devoted its
front cover to depicting one corner of the study and laboratory room of
the shop.[16] Also, in a letter dated January 2, 1947, addressed to Dr.
Alexander Wetmore, then Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr.
Robert P. Fischelis, the secretary of the American Pharmaceutical
Association, considered the completion of the deposited exhibition a
triumph and &ldquo;as one of the highlights of the accomplishments of the
Association in 1946.&rdquo;

From 1946 to 1948, the Division&rsquo;s collection was further enriched with
a number of historical specimens, among which was a &ldquo;grosse Flamme&rdquo; x-ray machine with induction-coil tube and stand developed by Albert B.
Koett. It is one of the earliest American-made machines of its kind,
producing a 12-inch spark, the largest usable at that time with
180,000-volt capacity, and a forerunner of later autotransformers. Other
accessions included two 19th-century drug mills, an electric belt used
in quackery, two medicine chests, three sets of Hessian crucibles used
in a pioneer drugstore in Colorado, a drunkometer, mineral ores, and
purely produced chemical elements.

In the spring of 1948, Associate Curator Whitebread retired after 30
years of service with the U.S. National Museum. He was a pioneer in the
field of health museums and during his curatorship had developed a
moribund section into a Division of field-wide importance. Dr.
Whitebread was succeeded by George S. Thomas, also a pharmacist, who
served as associate curator from August 1948 until early 1952.

[290]

During his almost-three and a half years of service, Thomas acquired
hearing-aid appliances from which he designed an exhibit on the
development of these aids, surgical sutures, early samples of
Aureomycin, and a static-electricity machine made by Henkel about 1840.
He also published three short articles under the title, &ldquo;Now
and Then,&rdquo; in the National Capital Pharmacist (1950), no. 1, pp. 8-9; no. 2, pp.
18-19, 29; and no. 3, pp. 15-16. In early 1952, Dr. Arthur O. Morton
presented to the Division, a Swiss-made keratometer which he had
purchased in 1907, and it is believed to be one of the first used in the
United States to measure the curves of the cornea.

The achievements of the Division reached their highest point, thus far,
in significantly increasing the national collection, as well as in
contributing to the scientific, historical, and professional literature,
under the curatorships of George B. Griffenhagen (December 8, 1952, to
June 27, 1959) and John B. Blake (July 1, 1957, to September 2, 1961).
Their reorganization of exhibits and collections, their competence and
industry, fulfilled the hopes, plans, and purposes laid down by earlier
curators for the Division.

Immediately after assuming the responsibilities of the Division and
throughout 1953, Mr. Griffenhagen (M.S. in pharmaceutical chemistry from
the University of Southern California) undertook to develop the
collections still further. He increased the emphasis not only on
historical pharmacy, but also on medicine, surgery, and dentistry. He
also renovated the exhibits in the medical gallery.

In 1954, several antibiotics were donated to the Division including a
mold of Penicillium notatum prepared and presented to the Smithsonian
Institution by Sir Alexander Fleming (1881-1955), the discoverer of
penicillium (1929), and a few Petri dishes used by botanist Benjamin M.
Daggar who, while working for Lederle Laboratories, developed Aureomycin
(chlortetracycline) in 1948. The Forest D. Dodrill&mdash;G.M.R. mechanical
heart (1952), the first machine reported to be used successfully for the
complete bypass of one side of the human heart during a surgical
operation,
[17]
was presented to the Smithsonian Institution.

The following year, 1955, the Division acquired one of the earliest
Einthoven string galvanometers (named after the Dutch physiologist Willem
Einthoven, 1860-1927) made in the United States in 1914 by Charles F.
Hindle for an electrocardiograph. Also added to the Division&rsquo;s
collections was the electrocardiograph used by Dr. Frank E. Wilson of
the United States, a pioneer educator in this field. Two temporary
exhibits on allergy and surgical dressings were installed in the
gallery. In the same year, Curator Griffenhagen published Early
American Pharmacies, a catalog on 28 pharmacy restorations in this
country.

In 1956, among many publications of interest in the fields of medical
and pharmaceutical history, was Curator Griffenhagen&rsquo;s Pharmacy
Museum, with a foreword by Laurence V. Coleman, who termed it a useful
catalog and &ldquo;a good reflection of the history of the museum movement at
large.&rdquo; A third x-ray tube of Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen (1845-1922) was
added to the collection in 1957 as well as a complete set of
hospital-ward fixtures of about 1900 from the Massachusetts General
Hospital, rare patent medicines, 18th-century microscopes, and a
13th-century mortar and pestle made in Persia.

In 1957, Mr. Griffenhagen published a series of illustrated articles in
the Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association, Practical
Pharmacy Edition, which were later reprinted by the Association in a
booklet entitled, Tools of the Apothecary. In it, he described several
pharmaceutical specimens in the collection and their place in history.




Division of Medical Sciences (1957 to Present)

The U.S. National Museum was reorganized on July 1, 1957, into two
units, the Natural History Museum and the Museum of History and
Technology. At the same time, and in view of the widening scope of the
Division, its more scientifically based planning, and the constantly
increasing collection with equal emphasis on all branches of the healing
arts, the Division&rsquo;s title was changed to the Division of Medical
Sciences&mdash;the title it still bears in 1964. With the reorganization, the
Department of Engineering and Industries, under which the Division fell
administratively, was renamed the Department of Science and Technology
of the Museum of History and Technology. It was also the first time
since its establishment in 1881 that the Division had two curators, for
on July 1, 1957, Dr. John B. Blake joined the staff.[291]


  
  
  Figure 19.&mdash;Curators

  Griffenhagen examine the newly acquired (1957) electromagnetic,
  Morton-Wimshurst-Holz Influence Machine. It was manufactured by the
  Bowen Company of Providence, Rhode Island (1889). With the discovery of
  x-ray, it was used for making x-ray photographs until early in the 20th
  century.


As a result of these changes, the Division was subdivided into a Section
of Pharmaceutical History and Health and a Section of Medical and Dental
History. The former was planned to encompass the collections of materia medica, pharmaceutical equipment, and all material related to the
history of pharmacy, toxicology, pharmacology, and biochemistry, as well
as the Hall of Health which was opened November 2, 1957, and which
emphasizes man&rsquo;s progressing knowledge of his body and the functions of
its major organs.
[18] The latter Section was planned to include all that
belongs to the development of surgery, medicine, dentistry, and nursing,
especially in relation to hospitals.

In October 1957, the Division acquired a collection of rare, ceramic,
drug jars which included two, 13th-century, North Syrian and Persian,
albarello-shaped, majolica jars; a 15th-century, Hispano-Moresque drug
container; and a 16th-century, Italian faience, dragon-spout ewer.
During the following two years, Curator Griffenhagen periodically toured
museums and medical and pharmaceutical institutions in this country,
South America, and Europe gathering specimens and information for the
Division and for publication, respectively. However, on June 27, 1959,
he resigned his curatorship to join the staff of the American
Pharmaceutical Association in Washington, D.C. Dr. Blake became the
curator in charge of the Division and Mr. Griffenhagen was succeeded on
September 24, 1959, by the author of this paper as associate curator in
charge of the Section of Pharmaceutical History and Health.

Dr. Blake, as curator of the Section of Medical and Dental History,
acquired a large number of valuable and varied specimens for the
Division&rsquo;s collections. They included optometric refracting instruments,
an early 1920&rsquo;s General Electric, portable, x-ray machine, the Charles
A. Lindbergh and Alexis Carrel pump (designed in 1935 to perfuse
life-sustaining fluids to the organs of the body), the Sewell heart pump
(1950) to control delivery of air pressure and suction to the pumping
mechanism, and a large and valuable collection of dental equipment
formerly at the universities of Pennsylvania and Illinois. Dr. Blake
wrote the explanatory material and supervised the design and production
of the majority of exhibits in the renovated hall of medical and dental
history. He also contributed several scholarly articles and a book (see
bibliography) on the history of the healing arts and public health in
particular. He resigned on September 2, 1961, to join the staff of the
National Library of Medicine as chief of the History of Medicine
Division, and was succeeded by the author as curator of the Division.
From the summer of 1962 to April 1964, the Division benefited from the
expert advice of Dr. Alfred R. Henderson as consultant in the
preparation and designing of the surgical and medical exhibits of the
Museum of History and Technology.

During the period from 1961 to May 1964, the Division&rsquo;s collections
expanded greatly through its [292]medical, dental, and pharmaceutical
acquisitions. Specimens of antiques acquired from 1961 through 1963
numbered up to 1,539 and included gifts from leading institutions and
individual philanthropists. The scope of these gifts and acquisitions
ranges from electronic resuscitators, microscopes, x-ray equipment, and
spectacles, to patent medicines, amulets, apothecary tools, dental
instruments, and office material of practitioners.

In the last decade, the interest in the national endeavor for promoting
research and scholarship in the history of medicine has increased
greatly. It was most appropriate, therefore, for the Smithsonian
Institution to play host on May 2 for two sessions of the 37th annual
meeting of the American Association for the History of Medicine held in
the Washington, D.C., area from April 30 through May 2, 1964. In
welcoming the members to the morning session in the auditorium of the
new Museum of History and Technology, Frank A. Taylor, director of the
United States National Museum, expressed the feeling that the meeting of
the Association was, in a sense, a dedication of the new auditorium and
an opportunity for the Smithsonian to reaffirm its deep interest and
commitment in fostering research and furthering the appreciation of
scholarly endeavor in the history of the healing arts.




A New Dimension For the Healing Arts

&ldquo;One day the United States will have a National Museum of science,
engineering, and industry, as most large nations have.&rdquo; This was the
prediction made in 1946 by the director of the U.S. National Museum, Mr.
Frank A. Taylor, then curator of the Division of
Engineering.
[19] It was
in 1963, that the new $36,000,000 building of the Museum of History
[293]
and Technology was completed, and opened to the public in 1964. The
offices of the Division of Medical Sciences as well as the reference and
study collections were moved to the fifth floor of the new building. The
exhibits, however, will be displayed in the gallery at the southwest
corner of the first floor. These exhibits, it is hoped, will show a new
dimension and an unprecedented approach in displaying the development of
the healing arts throughout the ages and the instruments and equipment
associated with health professions. They also present the expanding
objectives and plans of the Division&rsquo;s growth as an integral part of the
Smithsonian Institution. Conveniently, the exhibits form four, closely
connected halls in one large gallery which will be open to the public in
the summers of 1965 to 1966.


  
  Figure 21.&mdash;Exhibit
  on the development of blood-pressure
  instruments and the early 20th-century sphygmomanometers which was
  completed in 1960. (Smithsonian photo 47943-M.)


1. The Hall of Health displays models and graphic and historical exhibit
materials to demonstrate the function of the various healthy organs of
the human body. The main topics emphasized are: embryology and
childbirth; tooth structure; the heart and blood circulation;
respiration; the endocrine glands; kidneys and the urinary-excretory
system; the brain and the nervous system; the ear; and vision and the
use of eyeglasses.

The most appreciated exhibit of all in this Hall is the &ldquo;transparent
woman&rdquo; figure which rotates, automatically, every 15 minutes with a
recorded message describing the function of each major organ of the body
at the same time that the organ is electronically lighted, so that the
viewer can see its place in the body.

  exhibit designed in 1962. It
  includes otologist Julius Lempert&rsquo;s personal memorabilia and original
  surgical instruments used in the fenestration operation for restoring
  hearing. (Smithsonian photo 49345-C.)


2. The Hall of Medicine and Dentistry will depict the history of these
two sciences with exhibits of the equipment used through the centuries.
In the medical field, early trephining and other surgical instruments
will be displayed along with a diorama of an 1805 surgical operation
performed by Dr. Philip Syng Physick in the amphitheater of the
Pennsylvania Hospital. Diagnostic instruments such as stethoscopes,
endoscopes, speculums, and blood-pressure measuring devices will be
exhibited with a series of microscopes illustrating the development of
these instruments. Exhibits of original galvanometers and other
apparatus will trace the development of cardiography. The early use of
anesthesia will be shown by apparatus of William Morton and Crawford W.
Long, American pioneers in this field. The development of the devices of
modern medicine and surgery will be shown by exhibits of the iron lung
and x-ray tubes, including a tube used by W. K. Roentgen. Medicine
chests and surgical kits of different periods will graphically summarize
the state of medical science in the period each represents.

Exhibits on the development of dentistry and dental surgery will display
examples of tooth-filling and extracting tools, drilling apparatus from
the early hand and foot engines to the first ultrasonic cutting
instrument (1954), and the original contra-angle,
[295]
hydraulic and air-turbine handpiece model
[20] which revolutionized the field of
instrumentation for dental surgery (with speeds of 200,000 to 400,000
rpm). This hydraulic turbine of Dr. Robert J. Nelson and associates of
the National Bureau of Standards set the design pattern for the
remarkable and successful high-speed, air-turbine handpiece developed by
Paul H. Tanner and Oscar P. Nagel of the U.S. Naval Dental School in
1956. Also underway is the reconstruction of the offices of famous
dentists such as G. V. Black and the father of American orthodontia,
Edward H. Angle, using their original equipment and instruments. In
addition, an exhibit is planned to include x-ray tubes and the electric
dental engine, the first to be operated in a human mouth by the pioneer
dentist on dental skiagraphy, Charles E. Kells
(1856-1928).
[21]

  on nursing bottles and measures to
  promote child health to counteract the once-common diseases of
  childhood. This display was completed in 1962. (Smithsonian photo
  49345-G.)


3. The Hall of Pharmaceutical History will feature exhibits on the
reconstruction of two pharmacy shops: an 18th-century apothecary shop,
originally from Germany, with a very elegant collection of drug jars,
decorated medicinal bottles, balances, mortars and pestles, and other
tools and documents pertaining to the apothecary art, and a late
19th-century American drugstore with shelves filled with patent
medicines and drug containers of various sizes and shapes. The window
will also feature symbols of pharmacy and beautiful show globes.
Displays will show the development of antibiotics and the early tools
used in the manufacture of the so-called &ldquo;miracle drugs,&rdquo; including a
mold from Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. In
addition, a platform will be reconstructed to display a variety of
pharmaceutical apparatus used in the preparation and manufacture of
[296]
drugs, such as tablet and capsule machines and drug mills and
percolators. Recently, with the assistance of Professor Glenn
Sonnedecker, the Division acquired a fine collection of pharmaceutical
equipment and devices from the School of Pharmacy of the University of
Wisconsin.


  
  
  Figure 24.&mdash;The
  origins of drugs from the three natural
  kingdoms, drug synthesis, and the increase in the manufacture of
  vitamins. This display was completed in 1962 and is now on display at
  the Museum of History and Technology. (Smithsonian photo P6316.)


Since the Division houses the largest collection of materia medica in
the country, a representative cross section of crude drugs will be
displayed in alphabetical order as well as a display illustrating the
role of cinchona and antimalarial drugs in the fight against disease. An
exhibit will portray the &ldquo;origin of drugs&rdquo; from the three natural
kingdoms, animal, vegetable, and mineral, together with synthetic drugs
including the manufacture of vitamins.

Plans are being made for an elaborate exhibit of weights and balances
used in many countries throughout the centuries, their impact on
accuracy of dosage and weighing of drugs, and their use in the
apothecary art.

The Division will also display pictorial and printed materials, as well
as artifacts from all periods and all countries. These collections are
intended to help in presenting a more complete picture of the story of
the medical sciences for educational purposes and research, and to
increase man&rsquo;s knowledge in fighting disease and promoting health.

Thus, from a few hundred specimens of crude drugs in the Section of
Materia Medica of 83 years ago, there has developed a Museum Division
today which embraces the evolution of the health professions through the
ages. This Division now has the largest collection in the Western
Hemisphere of historical objects which are related to the healing arts.
The reference collections are available to the researcher and scholar,
and the exhibits are intended for pleasure and educational purposes in
these fields. The plans for expansion have no limitation as we keep pace
with man&rsquo;s progress in the medical sciences and continue to collect
materials that contributed to the historical development in the fight
against diseases and the attempts to secure better health for everyone.

Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for the Year 1882 [hereinafter referred to as the
Smithsonian Annual Report], pp. 101-103; and introductory
&ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; to the lectures published by the Smithsonian Institution
in its Miscellaneous Collections (see bibliography).

[2] Dr. J. J. Woodward&rsquo;s lecture explained the progress of medical
knowledge of morbid growth and cancerous tumors from 1865 to 1872. It
cautioned that uncertain methods of diagnosis at that time allowed
charlatans and uneducated practitioners to report cures of cancer in
instances where nonmalignant growths were &ldquo;removed by their caustic
pastes and plasters.&rdquo;

[3] The two longest intervals were in preparing the last two lectures:
the ninth in 1884, and the tenth, 1889. Both came after the
establishment in 1881 of the Section of Materia Medica in the U.S.

pictures of its plant next to it. Consideration was given to displaying
enlarged drawings to show the minute structure of the specimen for
better identification. In addition, an exhibition of several 10-liter
vessels of the most popular mineral waters was planned. The amount of
saline substances which analysis had shown to be present in each vessel
was to be listed in a table to be attached to that vessel, or the same
amount of minerals was to be put in a small bottle beside it. This plan
was carried out to the best advantage at the Cotton States and
International Exposition held in 1895 in Atlanta, Georgia.

DEVELOPMENT OF GRAVITY PENDULUMS
IN THE 19th CENTURY




Figure 1.&mdash;A study of the figure of the earth was one of the earliest projects of the
French Academy of Sciences. In order to test the effect of the earth&rsquo;s rotation on its
gravitational force, the Academy in 1672 sent Jean Richer to the equatorial island of
Cayenne to compare the rate of a clock which was known to have kept accurate time in
Paris. Richer found that the clock lost 2 minutes and 28 seconds at Cayenne, indicating
a substantial decrease in the force of gravity on the pendulum. Subsequent pendulum
experiments revealed that the period of a pendulum varied not only with the latitude but
also regionally, under the influence of topographical features such as mountains. It
became clear that the measurement of gravity should be made a part of the work of the
geodetic surveyor.


[303]


The history of gravity pendulums dates back to the
time of Galileo. After the discovery of the variation of
the force of gravity over the surface of the earth, gravity
measurement became a major concern of physics and
geodesy. This article traces the history of the development
of instruments for this purpose.

The
intensity of gravity, or the acceleration of a
freely falling body, is an important physical quantity
for the several physical sciences. The intensity of
gravity determines the weight of a standard pound
or kilogram as a standard or unit of force. In physical
experiments, the force on a body may be measured
by determining the weight of a known mass which
serves to establish equilibrium against it. Thus, in
the absolute determination of the ampere with a current
balance, the force between two coils carrying
current is balanced by the earth&rsquo;s gravitational force
upon a body of determinable mass. The intensity of
gravity enters into determinations of the size of the
earth from the angular velocity of the moon, its
distance from the earth, and Newton&rsquo;s inverse square
law of gravitation and the laws of motion. Prediction
of the motion of an artificial satellite requires an
accurate knowledge of gravity for this astronomical
problem.

The gravity field of the earth also provides data for
a determination of the figure of the earth, or geoid,
but for this problem of geodesy relative values of
gravity are sufficient. If g is the intensity of gravity
at some reference station, and &#916;g is the difference
between intensities at two stations, the values of
gravity in geodetic calculations enter as ratios (&#916;g)/g
over the surface of the earth. Gravimetric investigations
in conjunction with other forms of geophysical
investigation, such as seismology, furnish data to test
[304]
hypotheses concerning the internal structure of the
earth.

Whether the intensity of gravity is sought in absolute
or relative measure, the most widely used instrument
for its determination since the creation of classical
mechanics has been the pendulum. In recent decades,
there have been invented gravity meters based
upon the principle of the spring, and these instruments
have made possible the rapid determination of
relative values of gravity to a high degree of accuracy.
The gravity meter, however, must be calibrated at
stations where the absolute value of gravity has been
determined by other means if absolute values are
sought. For absolute determinations of gravity, the
pendulum historically has been the principal instrument
employed. Although alternative methods of
determining absolute values of gravity are now in use,
the pendulum retains its value for absolute determinations,
and even retains it for relative determinations,
as is exemplified by the Cambridge Pendulum Apparatus
and that of the Dominion Observatory at
Ottawa, Ontario.

The pendulums employed for absolute or relative
determinations of gravity have been of two basic
types. The first form of pendulum used as a physical
instrument consisted of a weight suspended by a fiber,
cord, or fine wire, the upper end of which was attached
to a fixed support. Such a pendulum may be called
a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; pendulum; the enclosure of the word
simple by quotation marks is to indicate that such a
pendulum is an approximation to a simple, or mathematical
pendulum, a conceptual object which consists
of a mass-point suspended by a weightless
inextensible cord. If l is the length of the simple
pendulum, the time of swing (half-period in the sense
of physics) for vibrations of infinitely small amplitude,
as derived from Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion and the
hypothesis that weight is proportional to mass, is
T = &#960;&#8730;(l/g).

The second form of pendulum is the compound, or
physical, pendulum. It consists of an extended
solid body which vibrates about a fixed axis under
the action of the weight of the body. A compound
pendulum may be constituted to oscillate about one
axis only, in which case it is nonreversible and
applicable only for relative measurements. Or a
compound pendulum may be constituted to oscillate
about two axes, in which case it is reversible (or
&ldquo;convertible&rdquo;) and may be used to determine absolute
values of gravity. Capt. Henry Kater, F.R.S.,
during the years 1817-1818 was the first to design,
construct, and use a compound pendulum for the
absolute determination of gravity. He constructed
a convertible pendulum with two knife edges and
with it determined the absolute value of gravity at
the house of Henry Browne, F.R.S., in Portland
Place, London. He then constructed a similar
compound pendulum with only one knife edge, and
swung it to determine relative values of gravity at a
number of stations in the British Isles. The 19th
century witnessed the development of the theory and
practice of observations with pendulums for the
determination of absolute and relative values of
gravity.




Galileo, Huygens, and Newton


The pendulum has been both an objective and an
instrument of physical investigation since the foundations
of classical mechanics were fashioned in the
17th century.
[1] It is tradition that the youthful
Galileo discovered that the period of oscillation of a
pendulum is constant by observations of the swings
of the great lamp suspended from the ceiling in the
cathedral of Pisa.
[2] The lamp was only a rough
approximation to a simple pendulum, but Galileo
later performed more accurate experiments with a
&ldquo;simple&rdquo; pendulum which consisted of a heavy ball
suspended by a cord. In an experiment designed to
confirm his laws of falling bodies, Galileo lifted the
ball to the level of a given altitude and released it.
The ball ascended to the same level on the other side
of the vertical equilibrium position and thereby
confirmed a prediction from the laws. Galileo also
discovered that the period of vibration of a &ldquo;simple&rdquo;
pendulum varies as the square root of its length, a
[305]
result which is expressed by the formula for the time
of swing of the ideal simple pendulum. He also
used a pendulum to measure lapse of time, and he
designed a pendulum clock. Galileo&rsquo;s experimental
results are important historically, but have required
correction in the light of subsequent measurements
of greater precision.

Mersenne in 1644 made the first determination of
the length of the seconds pendulum,
[3] that is, the length
of a simple pendulum that beats seconds (half-period
in the sense of physics). Subsequently, he
proposed the problem to determine the length of
the simple pendulum equivalent in period to a given
compound pendulum. This problem was solved
by Huygens, who in his famous work Horologium
oscillatorium &#8230; (1673) set forth the theory of the
compound pendulum.
[4]

Huygens derived a theorem which has provided
the basis for the employment of the reversible compound
pendulum for the absolute determination of
the intensity of gravity. The theorem is that a given
compound pendulum possesses conjugate points on
opposite sides of the center of gravity; about these
points, the periods of oscillation are the same. For
each of these points as center of suspension the other
point is the center of oscillation, and the distance
between them is the length of the equivalent simple
pendulum. Earlier, in 1657, Huygens independently
had invented and patented the pendulum clock,
which rapidly came into use for the measurement
of time. Huygens also created the theory of centripetal
force which made it possible to calculate the
effect of the rotation of the earth upon the observed
value of gravity.

The theory of the gravity field of the earth was
founded upon the laws of motion and the law of
gravitation by Isaac Newton in his famous Principia
(1687). It follows from the Newtonian theory
of gravitation that the acceleration of gravity as
determined on the surface of the earth is the
resultant of two factors: the principal factor is the
gravitational attraction of the earth upon bodies,
and the subsidiary factor is the effect of the rotation
of the earth. A body at rest on the surface of the
earth requires some of the gravitational attraction
for the centripetal acceleration of the body as it is
carried in a circle with constant speed by the rotation
of the earth about its axis. If the rotating earth is
used as a frame of reference, the effect of the rotation
is expressed as a centrifugal force which acts to
diminish the observed intensity of gravity.


Glossary of Gravity Terminology

ABSOLUTE GRAVITY: the value of the acceleration of gravity,
also expressed by the length of the seconds pendulum.

RELATIVE GRAVITY: the value of the acceleration of gravity
relative to the value at some standard point.

SIMPLE PENDULUM: see theoretical pendulum.

THEORETICAL PENDULUM: a heavy bob (point-mass) at the
end of a weightless rod.

SECONDS PENDULUM: a theoretical or simple pendulum of such
length that its time of swing (half-period) is one second.
(This length is about one meter.)

GRAVITY PENDULUM: a precisely made pendulum used for
the measurement of gravity.

COMPOUND PENDULUM: a pendulum in which the supporting
rod is not weightless; in other words, any actual pendulum.

CONVERTIBLE PENDULUM: a compound pendulum having
knife edges at different distances from the center of gravity.
Huygens demonstrated (1673) that if such a pendulum
were to swing with equal periods from either knife edge,
the distance between those knife edges would be equal to
the length of a theoretical or simple pendulum of the same
period.

REVERSIBLE PENDULUM: a convertible pendulum which is
also symmetrical in form.

INVARIABLE PENDULUM: a compound pendulum with only
one knife edge, used for relative measurement of gravity.



From Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion and the hypothesis
that weight is proportional to mass, the formula for
the half-period of a simple pendulum is given by
T = &#960;&#8730;(l/g). If a simple pendulum beats seconds,
1 = &#960;&#8730;(&#955;/g), where &#955; is the length of the seconds
pendulum. From T = &#960;&#8730;(l/g) and 1 = &#960;&#8730;(&#955;/g), it follows
that &#955; = l/T2. Then g = &#960;2&#955;. Thus, the intensity of
gravity can be expressed in terms of the length of
the seconds pendulum, as well as by the acceleration
of a freely falling body. During the 19th century,
gravity usually was expressed in terms of the length
of the seconds pendulum, but present practice is to
express gravity in terms of g, for which the unit is
the gal, or one centimeter per second per second.

CaÃ¯enne (Paris, 1679), shows most of the astronomical instruments used by Richer, namely,
one of the two pendulum clocks made by Thuret, the 20-foot and the 5-foot telescopes and
the large quadrant. The figure may be intended as a portrait of Richer. This drawing
was done by Sebastian Le Clerc, a young illustrator who made many illustrations of the
early work of the Paris Academy.





Figure of the Earth


A principal contribution of the pendulum as a
physical instrument has been the determination of the
figure of the earth.
[5] That the earth is spherical in
form was accepted doctrine among the ancient
Greeks. Pythagoras is said to have been the first to
describe the earth as a sphere, and this view was
adopted by Eudoxus and Aristotle.

The Alexandrian scientist Eratosthenes made the
first estimate of the diameter and circumference of
a supposedly spherical earth by an astronomical-geodetic
method. He measured the angle between
the directions of the rays of the sun at Alexandria
and Syene (Aswan), Egypt, and estimated the distance
between these places from the length of time
required by a caravan of camels to travel between
them. From the central angle corresponding to the
arc on the surface, he calculated the radius and hence
the circumference of the earth. A second measurement
was undertaken by Posidonius, who measured
the altitudes of stars at Alexandria and Rhodes and
estimated the distance between them from the time
required to sail from one place to the other.

With the decline of classical antiquity, the doctrine
of the spherical shape of the earth was lost, and only
one investigation, that by the Arabs under Calif
Al-Mamun in A.D. 827, is recorded until the 16th
century. In 1525, the French mathematician Fernel
measured the length of a degree of latitude between
Paris and Amiens by the revolutions of the wheels of
his carriage, the circumference of which he had determined.
In England, Norwood in 1635 measured
the length of an arc between London and York with a
chain. An important forward step in geodesy was
the measurement of distance by triangulation, first
by Tycho Brahe, in Denmark, and later, in 1615, by
Willebrord Snell, in Holland.

Of historic importance, was the use of telescopes in
the triangulation for the measurement of a degree of
arc by the AbbÃ© Jean Picard in 1669.
[6] He had been
commissioned by the newly established Academy of
Sciences to measure an arc corresponding to an angle
of 1&deg;, 22&#8242;, 55&#8243; of the meridian between Amiens
and Malvoisine, near Paris. Picard proposed to the
Academy the measurement of the meridian of Paris
through all of France, and this project was supported
by Colbert, who obtained the approval of the King.
In 1684, Giovanni-Domenico Cassini and De la Hire
commenced a trigonometrical measure of an arc
south of Paris; subsequently, Jacques Cassini, the son
[307]
of Giovanni-Domenico, added the arc to the north
of Paris. The project was completed in 1718. The
length of a degree of arc south of Paris was found to
be greater than the length north of Paris. From the
difference, 57,097 toises
[7] minus 56,960 toises, it was
concluded that the polar diameter of the earth is larger
than the equatorial diameter, i.e., that the earth is a
prolate spheroid (fig.&nbsp;3).




Figure 3.&mdash;Measurements
of the length of a degree
of latitude which were completed in different parts
of France in 1669 and 1718 gave differing results
which suggested that the shape of the earth is not
a sphere but a prolate spheroid (1). But Richer&rsquo;s
pendulum observation of 1672, as explained by
Huygens and Newton, indicated that its shape is
that of an oblate spheroid (2). The disagreement
is reflected in this drawing. In the 1730&rsquo;s it
was resolved in favor of the latter view by two
French geodetic expeditions for the measurement
of degrees of latitude in the equatorial and polar
regions (Ecuador&mdash;then part of Peru&mdash;and Lapland).

Meanwhile, Richer in 1672 had been sent to
Cayenne, French Guiana, to make astronomical
observations and to measure the length of the seconds
pendulum.
[8]
He took with him a pendulum clock
which had been adjusted to keep accurate time in
Paris. At Cayenne, however, Richer found that the
clock was retarded by 2 minutes and 28 seconds per
day (fig.&nbsp;1). He also fitted
up a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; pendulum to
vibrate in seconds and measured the length of this
seconds pendulum several times every week for 10
months. Upon his return to Paris, he found that
the length of the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; pendulum which beat
seconds at Cayenne was 11/4 Paris
lines
[9] shorter than
the length of the seconds pendulum at Paris. Huygens
explained the reduction in the length of the seconds
pendulum&mdash;and, therefore, the lesser intensity of
gravity at the equator with respect to the value at
Paris&mdash;in terms of his theory of centripetal force as
applied to the rotation of the earth and
pendulum.
[10]

A more complete theory was given by Newton in
the Principia.
[11]
Newton showed that if the earth is
assumed to be a homogeneous, mutually gravitating
fluid globe, its rotation will result in a bulging at the
equator. The earth will then have the form of an
oblate spheroid, and the intensity of gravity as a
form of universal gravitation will vary with position
on the surface of the earth. Newton took into
account gravitational attraction and centrifugal action,
and he calculated the ratio of the axes of the
spheroid to be 230:229. He calculated and prepared
a table of the lengths of a degree of latitude and of
the seconds pendulum for every 5&deg; of latitude from
the equator to the pole. A discrepancy between his
predicted length of the seconds pendulum at the
equator and Richer&rsquo;s measured length was explained
by Newton in terms of the expansion of the scale
with higher temperatures near the equator.

Newton&rsquo;s theory that the earth is an oblate spheroid
was confirmed by the measurements of Richer, but
was rejected by the Paris Academy of Sciences, for
it contradicted the results of the Cassinis, father and
son, whose measurements of arcs to the south and
north of Paris had led to the conclusion that the
earth is a prolate spheroid. Thus, a controversy
arose between the English scientists and the Paris
Academy. The conflict was finally resolved by the
results of expeditions sent by the Academy to Peru
and Sweden. The first expedition, under Bouguer,
La Condamine, and Godin in 1735, went to a region
[308]
in Peru, and, with the help of the Spaniard Ullo,
measured a meridian arc of about 3&deg;7&#8242; near Quito,
now in Ecuador.
[12] The second expedition, with
Maupertuis and Clairaut in 1736, went to Lapland
within the Arctic Circle and measured an arc of
about 1&deg; in length.
[13] The northern arc of 1&deg; was
found to be longer than the Peruvian arc of 1&deg;, and
thus it was confirmed that the earth is an oblate
spheroid, that is, flattened at the poles, as predicted
by the theory of Newton.




Figure 4.&mdash;The
direct use of a clock to measure the force of gravity was found to be
limited in accuracy by the necessary mechanical connection of the
pendulum to the clock, and by the unavoidable difference between the
characteristics of a clock pendulum and those of a theoretical (usually
called &ldquo;simple&rdquo;) pendulum, in which the mass is concentrated
in the bob, and the supporting rod is weightless.

After 1735, the clock was used only to time the swing of a detached
pendulum, by the method of &ldquo;coincidences.&rdquo; In this method,
invented by J. J. Mairan, the length of the detached pendulum is first
accurately measured, and the clock is corrected by astronomical
observation. The detached pendulum is then swung before the clock
pendulum as shown here. The two pendulums swing more or less out of
phase, coming into coincidence each time one has gained a vibration. By
counting the number of coincidences over several hours, the period of
the detached pendulum can be very accurately determined. The length and
period of the detached pendulum are the data required for the
calculation of the force of gravity.



The period from Eratosthenes to Picard has been
called the spherical era of geodesy; the period from
Picard to the end of the 19th century has been called
the ellipsoidal period. During the latter period the
earth was conceived to be an ellipsoid, and the determination
of its ellipticity, that is, the difference of
equatorial radius and polar radius divided by the
equatorial radius, became an important geodetic
problem. A significant contribution to the solution
of this problem was made by determinations of
gravity by the pendulum.

An epoch-making work during the ellipsoidal era
[309]
of geodesy was Clairaut&rsquo;s treatise, ThÃ©orie de la figure
de la terre.
[14] On the
hypothesis that the earth is a
spheroid of equilibrium, that is, such that a layer of
water would spread all over it, and that the internal
density varies so that layers of equal density are
coaxial spheroids, Clairaut derived a historic
theorem: If &#947;E, &#947;P are the
values of gravity at the
equator and pole, respectively, and c the centrifugal
force at the equator divided by &#947;E, then the ellipticity
&#945; = (5/2)c - (&#947;P - &#947;E)/&#947;E.

Laplace showed that the surfaces of equal density
might have any nearly spherical form, and Stokes
showed that it is unnecessary to assume any law of
density as long as the external surface is a spheroid of
equilibrium.
[15] It follows
from Clairaut&rsquo;s theorem
that if the earth is an oblate spheroid, its ellipticity
can be determined from relative values of gravity
and the absolute value at the equator involved in c.
Observations with nonreversible, invariable compound
pendulums have contributed to the application
of Clairaut&rsquo;s theorem in its original and contemporary
extended form for the determination of the figure and
gravity field of the earth.




Early Types of Pendulums


The pendulum employed in observations of gravity
prior to the 19th century usually consisted of a small
weight suspended by a filament (figs.
4-6). The
pioneer experimenters with &ldquo;simple&rdquo; pendulums
changed the length of the suspension until the pendulum
beat seconds. Picard in 1669 determined the
length of the seconds pendulum at Paris with a
&ldquo;simple&rdquo; pendulum which consisted of a copper ball
an inch in diameter suspended by a fiber of pite
from jaws (pite was a preparation of the leaf of a
species of aloe and was not affected appreciably by
moisture).

A celebrated set of experiments with a &ldquo;simple&rdquo;
pendulum was conducted by
Bouguer
[16] in 1737 in
the Andes, as part of the expedition to measure the
Peruvian arc. The bob of the pendulum was a double
truncated cone, and the length was measured from
the jaw suspension to the center of oscillation of the
thread and bob. Bouguer allowed for change of
length of his measuring rod with temperature and
also for the buoyancy of the air. He determined the
time of swing by an elementary form of the method
of coincidences. The thread of the pendulum was
swung in front of a scale and Bouguer observed how
long it took the pendulum to lose a number of vibrations
on the seconds clock. For this purpose, he
noted the time when the beat of the clock was heard
and, simultaneously, the thread moved past the
center of the scale. A historic aspect of Bouguer&rsquo;s
method was that he employed an &ldquo;invariable&rdquo;
pendulum, that is, the length was maintained the
same at the various stations of observation, a procedure
that has been described as having been
invented by Bouguer.

Since T =
&#960;&#8730;(l/g),
it follows that T12/T22 = g2/g1.
Thus, if the absolute value of gravity is known at one
station, the value at any other station can be determined
from the ratio of the squares of times of swing
of an invariable pendulum at the two stations. From
the above equation, if T1 is the time of swing at a
station where the intensity of gravity is g, and T2
is the time at a station where the intensity is g + &#916;g,
then (&#916;g)/g =
(T12/T22) - 1.

Bouguer&rsquo;s investigations with his invariable pendulum
yielded methods for the determination of the internal
structure of the earth. On the Peruvian
expedition, he determined the length of the seconds
pendulum at three stations, including one at Quito,
at varying distances above sea level. If values of
gravity at stations of different elevation are to be
compared, they must be reduced to the same level,
usually to sea level. Since gravity decreases with
height above sea level in accordance with the law of
gravitation, a free-air reduction must be applied to
values of gravity determined above the level of the
sea. Bouguer originated the additional reduction for
the increase in gravity on a mountain or plateau
caused by the attraction of the matter in a plate.
From the relative values of gravity at elevated stations
in Peru and at sea level, Bouguer calculated
that the mean density of the earth was 4.7 times
greater than that of the
cordilleras.
[17] For greater
accuracy in the study of the internal structure of the
earth, in the 19th century the Bouguer plate reduction
[310]
came to be supplemented by corrections for irregularities
of terrain and by different types of isostatic
reduction.

La Condamine, who like Bouguer was a member of
the Peruvian expedition, conducted his own pendulum
experiments (fig.&nbsp;4). He experimented in 1735 at
Santo Domingo en route to South
America,
[18] then
at various stations in South America, and again at
Paris upon his return to France. His pendulum consisted
of a copper ball suspended by a thread of pite.
For experimentation the length initially was about 12
feet, and the time of swing 2 seconds, but then the
length was reduced to about 3 feet with time of swing
1 second. Earlier, when it was believed that gravity
was constant over the earth, Picard and others had
proposed that the length of the seconds pendulum be
chosen as the standard. La Condamine in 1747
revived the proposal in the form that the length of the
seconds pendulum at the equator be adopted as the
standard of length. Subsequently, he investigated the
expansion of a toise of iron from the variation in the
period of his pendulum. In 1755, he observed the
pendulum at Rome with Boscovich. La Condamine&rsquo;s
pendulum was used by other observers and finally was
lost at sea on an expedition around the world. The
knowledge of the pendulum acquired by the end of the
18th century was summarized in 1785 in a memoir by
Boscovich.
[19]







Figure 5.&mdash;An
apparatus for the practice measurement
of the length of the pendulum devised on the basis of a
series of preliminary experiments by C. M. de la Condamine
who, in the course of the French geodetic expedition
to Peru in 1735, devoted a 3-month sojourn on the island
of Santo Domingo to pendulum observations by Mairan&rsquo;s
Method. In this arrangement, shown here, a vertical rod
of ironwood is used both as the scale and as the support
for the apparatus, having at its top the brass pendulum
support (A) and, below, a horizontal mirror (O) which
serves to align the apparatus vertically through visual
observation of the reflection of the pointer projecting from
A. The pendulum, about 37 inches long, consists of a
thread of pite (a humidity-resistant, natural fiber) and
a copper ball of about 6 ounces. Its exact length is
determined by adjusting the micrometer (S) so that the
ball nearly touches the mirror. It will be noted that the
clock pendulum would be obscured by the scale. La
Condamine seems to have determined the times of
coincidence by visual observation of the occasions on
which &ldquo;the pendulums swing parallel.&rdquo; (Portion of plate
1, MÃ©moires publiÃ©s par la SociÃ©tÃ© franÃ§aise de Physique, vol. 4.)



[311]




Figure 6.&mdash;The
result of early pendulum
experiments was often expressed in terms of the
length of a pendulum which would have a
period of one second and was called &ldquo;the seconds
pendulum.&rdquo; In 1792, J. C. Borda and J. D.
Cassini determined the length of the seconds
pendulum at Paris with this apparatus. The
pendulum consists of a platinum ball about 11/2
inches in diameter, suspended by a fine iron
wire. The length, about 12 feet, was such that
its period would be nearly twice as long as that
of the pendulum of the clock (A). The interval
between coincidences was determined by observing,
through the telescope at the left, the
times when the two pendulums emerge together
from behind the screen (M). The exact length
of the pendulum was measured by a platinum
scale (not shown) equipped with a vernier and
an auxiliary copper scale for temperature
correction.
When, at the end of the 18th century, the
French revolutionary government established
the metric system of weights and measures, the
length of the seconds pendulum at Paris was
considered, but not adopted, as the unit of
length. (Plate 2, MÃ©moires publiÃ©s par la SociÃ©tÃ©
franÃ§aise de Physique, vol. 4.)


The practice with the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; pendulum on the
part of Picard, Bouguer, La Condamine and others
in France culminated in the work of Borda and Cassini
in 1792 at the observatory in Paris
[20]
(fig.&nbsp;6). The
[312]
experiments were undertaken to determine whether
or not the length of the seconds pendulum should be
adopted as the standard of length by the new government
of France. The bob consisted of a platinum
ball 161/6 Paris lines in diameter, and 9,911 grains
(slightly more than 17 ounces) in weight. The bob
was held to a brass cup covering about one-fifth of
its surface by the interposition of a small quantity of
grease. The cup with ball was hung by a fine iron
wire about 12 Paris feet long. The upper end of the
wire was attached to a cylinder which was part of a
wedge-shaped knife edge, on the upper surface of
which was a stem on which a small adjustable weight
was held by a screw thread. The knife edge rested on
a steel plate. The weight on the knife-edge apparatus
was adjusted so that the apparatus would vibrate
with the same period as the pendulum. Thus, the
mass of the suspending apparatus could be neglected
in the theory of motion of the pendulum about the
knife edge.




Figure 7.&mdash;Results
of experiments in the determination
of the length of the seconds pendulum at KÃ¶nigsberg by a
new method were reported by F. W. Bessel in 1826 and
published in 1828. With this apparatus, he obtained two
sets of data from the same pendulum, by using two different
points of suspension. The pendulum was about 10
feet long. The distance between the two points of suspension
(a and b) was 1 toise (about six feet). A micrometric
balance (c) below the bob was used to determine the increase
in length due to the weight of the bob. He projected
the image of the clock pendulum (not shown) onto
the gravity pendulum by means of a lens, thus placing the
clock some distance away and eliminating the disturbing
effect of its motion. (Portion of plate 6, MÃ©moires publiÃ©s
par la SociÃ©tÃ© franÃ§aise de Physique, vol. 4.)


In the earlier suspension from jaws there was uncertainty
as to the point about which the pendulum
oscillated. Borda and Cassini hung their pendulum
in front of a seconds clock and determined the time of
swing by the method of coincidences. The times on
the clock were observed when the clock gained or
lost one complete vibration (two swings) on the pendulum.
Suppose that the wire pendulum makes n
swings while the clock makes
2n + 2. If the clock
beats seconds exactly, the time of one complete
vibration is 2 seconds, and the time of swing of the
wire pendulum is T =
(2n + 2)/n =
2(1 + 1/n). An error
in the time caused by uncertainty in determining the
coincidence of clock and wire pendulum is reduced
[313]
by employing a long interval of observation 2n. The
whole apparatus was enclosed in a box, in order to
exclude disturbances from currents of air. Corrections
were made for buoyancy, for amplitude of swing and
for variations in length of the wire with temperature.
The final result was that the length of the seconds
pendulum at the observatory in Paris was determined
to be 440.5593 Paris lines, or 993.53 mm., reduced
to sea level 993.85 mm. Some years later the methods
of Borda were used by other French investigators,
among whom was Biot who used the platinum ball of
Borda suspended by a copper wire 60 cm. long.

Another historic &ldquo;simple&rdquo; pendulum was the one
swung by Bessel (fig.&nbsp;7) for the determination of
gravity at KÃ¶nigsberg 1825-1827.
[21] The pendulum
consisted of a ball of brass, copper, or ivory that was
suspended by a fine wire, the upper end of which
was wrapped and unwrapped on a horizontal
cylinder as support. The pendulum was swung
first from one point and then from another, exactly
a &ldquo;toise de Peru&rdquo;
[22] higher up, the bob being at
the same level in each case (fig.&nbsp;7). Bessel found the
period of vibration of the pendulum by the method
of coincidences; and in order to avoid disturbances
from the comparison clock, it was placed at some
distance from the pendulum under observation.

Bessel&rsquo;s experiments were significant in view of the
care with which he determined the corrections. He
corrected for the stiffness of the wire and for the lack
of rigidity of connection between the bob and wire.
The necessity for the latter correction had been
pointed out by Laplace, who showed that through
the circumstance that the pull of the wire is now on
one side and now on the other side of the center of
gravity, the bob acquires angular momentum about
its center of gravity, which cannot be accounted for
if the line of the wire, and therefore the force that it
exerts, always passed through the center. In addition
to a correction for buoyancy of the air considered
by his predecessors, Bessel also took account of the
inertia of the air set in motion by the pendulum.




Figure 8.&mdash;Mode
of suspension of Bessel&rsquo;s pendulum is
shown here. The iron wire is supported by the thumbscrew
and clamp at the left, but passes over a pin at the
center, which is actually the upper terminal of the pendulum.
Bessel found this &ldquo;cylinder of unrolling&rdquo; superior
to the clamps and knife edges of earlier pendulums. The
counterweight at the right is part of a system for supporting
the scale in such a way that it is not elongated by its own
weight.

With this apparatus, Bessel determined the ratio of
the lengths of the two pendulums and their times of vibration.
From this the length of the seconds pendulum was
calculated. His method eliminated the need to take into
account such sources of inaccuracy as flexure of the pendulum
wire and imperfections in the shape of the bob.

Figure 9.&mdash;Friedrich
Wilhelm Bessel (1784-1846),
German mathematician and astronomer. He became
the first superintendent of the Prussian observatory
established at KÃ¶nigsberg in 1810, and
remained there during the remainder of his life.
So important were his many contributions to precise
measurement and calculation in astronomy that he
is often considered the founder of the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; age
in that science. This characteristic also shows in
his venture into geodesy, 1826-1830, one product
of which was the pendulum experiment reported in
this article.


The latter effect had been discovered by Du Buat in
1786,
[23]
but his work was unknown to Bessel. The
length of the seconds pendulum at KÃ¶nigsberg,
reduced to sea level, was found by Bessel to be
440.8179 lines. In 1835, Bessel determined the
intensity of gravity at a site in Berlin where observations
later were conducted in the Imperial Office of
Weights and Measures by Charles S. Peirce of the
U.S. Coast Survey.




Kater&rsquo;s Convertible and Invariable Pendulums




Figure 10.&mdash;Henry
Kater (1777-1835),
English army officer and
physicist. His scientific career began
during his military service in
India, where he assisted in the
&ldquo;great trigonometrical survey.&rdquo;
Returned to England because of
bad health, and retired in 1814, he
pioneered (1818) in the development
of the convertible pendulum
as an alternative to the approximation
of the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; pendulum for
the measurement of the &ldquo;seconds
pendulum.&rdquo; Kater&rsquo;s convertible
pendulum and the invariable pendulum
introduced by him in 1819
were the basis of English pendulum
work. (Photo courtesy National Portrait
Gallery, London.)








Figure 11.&mdash;The attempt to approximate
the simple (theoretical) pendulum in
gravity experiments ended in 1817-18
when Henry Kater invented the compound
convertible pendulum, from which
the equivalent simple pendulum could be
obtained according to the method of
Huygens (see text, p. 314). Developed in
connection with a project to fix the
standard of English measure, Kater&rsquo;s pendulum
was called "compound" because it
was a solid bar rather than the fine wire
or string with which earlier experimenters
had tried to approximate a "weightless"
rod. It was called convertible because it
is alternately swung from the two knife
edges (a and b) at opposite ends. The
weights (f and g) are adjusted so that the
period of the pendulum is the same from
either knife edge. The distance between
the two knife edges is then equal to the
length of the equivalent simple pendulum.



The systematic survey of the gravity field of the
earth was given a great impetus by the contributions
of Capt. Henry Kater, F.R.S. In 1817, he designed,
constructed, and applied a convertible compound
pendulum for the absolute determination of gravity
at the house of Henry Browne, F.R.S., in Portland
Place, London.
[24]
Kater&rsquo;s convertible pendulum
(fig.&nbsp;11) consisted of a brass
rod to which were attached a
flat circular bob of brass and two adjustable weights,
the smaller of which was adjusted by a screw. The
convertibility of the pendulum was constituted by the
provision of two knife edges turned inwards on
opposite sides of the center of gravity. The pendulum
was swung on each knife edge, and the adjustable
weights were moved until the times of swing were the
same about each knife edge. When the times were
judged to be the same, the distance between the
knife edges was inferred to be the length of the
equivalent simple pendulum, in accordance with
Huygens&rsquo; theorem on conjugate points of a compound
pendulum. Kater determined the time of swing by
the method of coincidences (fig.&nbsp;12). He corrected
for the buoyancy of the air. The final value of the
length of the seconds pendulum at Browne&rsquo;s house in
London, reduced to sea level, was determined to be
39.13929 inches.

The convertible compound pendulum had been
conceived prior to its realization by Kater. In 1792,
on the occasion of the proposal in Paris to establish
the standard of length as the length of the seconds
pendulum, Baron de Prony had proposed the employment
of a compound pendulum with three axes of
oscillation.
[25]
In 1800, he proposed the convertible
compound pendulum with knife edges about which
the pendulum could complete swings in equal times.
De Prony&rsquo;s proposals were not accepted and his
papers remained unpublished until 1889, at which
time they were discovered by Defforges. The French
decision was to experiment with the ball pendulum,
and the determination of the length of the seconds
[315]
pendulum was carried out by Borda and Cassini by
methods previously described. Bohnenberger in his
Astronomie (1811),
[26] made the proposal to employ a
convertible pendulum for the absolute determination
of gravity; thus, he has received credit for priority in
publication. Capt. Kater independently conceived
of the convertible pendulum and was the first to
design, construct, and swing one.

After his observations with the convertible pendulum,
Capt. Kater designed an invariable compound
pendulum with a single knife edge but otherwise similar
in external form to the convertible pendulum
[27]
(fig.&nbsp;13). Thirteen of these Kater invariable pendulums
have been reported as constructed and swung
at stations throughout the world.
[28] Kater himself
swung an invariable pendulum at a station in London
and at various other stations in the British Isles.
Capt. Edward Sabine, between 1820 and 1825, made
voyages and swung Kater invariable pendulums at
stations from the West Indies to Greenland and
Spitzbergen.
[29]
In 1820, Kater swung a Kater invariable
pendulum at London and then sent it to Goldingham,
who swung it in 1821 at Madras,
India.
[30] Also
in 1820, Kater supplied an invariable pendulum to
Hall, who swung it at London and then made observations
near the equator and in the Southern Hemisphere,
and at London again in 1823.
[31] The same
pendulum, after its knives were reground, was delivered
to Adm. LÃ¼tke of Russia, who observed
gravity with it on a trip around the world between
1826 and 1829.
[32]

[316]





Figure 12.&mdash;The Kater convertible pendulum in use is placed before a clock, whose
pendulum bob is directly behind the extended &ldquo;tail&rdquo; of the Kater pendulum. A white
spot is painted on the center of the bob of the clock pendulum. The observing telescope,
left, has a diaphragm with a vertical slit of such width that its view is just filled by the tail
of the Kater pendulum when it is at rest. When the two pendulums are swinging, the
white spot on the clock pendulum can be seen on each swing except that in which the two
pendulums are in coincidence; thus, the coincidences are determined. (Portion of plate
5, MÃ©moires publiÃ©s par la SociÃ©tÃ© franÃ§aise de Physique, vol. 4.)


[317]




Figure 13.&mdash;This
drawing accompanied John Goldingham&rsquo;s report on the work done in India with Kater&rsquo;s
invariable pendulum. The value of gravity obtained, directly or indirectly, in terms of the simple pendulum,
is called &ldquo;absolute.&rdquo; Once absolute values of gravity were established at a number of stations, it became
possible to use the much simpler &ldquo;relative&rdquo; method for the measurement of gravity at new stations.
Because it has only one knife edge, and does not involve the adjustments of the convertible pendulum, this
one is called &ldquo;invariable.&rdquo; In use, it is first swung at a station where the absolute value of gravity has been
established, and this period is then compared with its period at one or more new stations. Kater developed
an invariable pendulum in 1819, which was used in England and in Madras, India, in 1821.





Figure 14.&mdash;Vacuum chamber for use with
the Kater pendulum. Of a number of
extraneous effects which tend to disturb the
accuracy of pendulum observations the most
important is air resistance. Experiments reported
by the Greenwich (England) observatory
in 1829 led to the development of a
vacuum chamber within which the pendulum
was swung.


While the British were engaged in swinging the
Kater invariable pendulums to determine relative
values of the length of the seconds pendulum, or
of gravity, the French also sent out expeditions.
Capt. de Freycinet made initial observations at Paris
with three invariable brass pendulums and one
wooden one, and then carried out observations at
Rio de Janeiro, Cape of Good Hope, Ãle de France,
Rawak (near New Guinea), Guam, Maui, and various
other places.
[33] A similar expedition was conducted
in 1822-1825 by Captain
Duperry.
[34]

During the years from 1827 to 1840, various types
of pendulum were constructed and swung by Francis
Baily, a member of the Royal Astronomical Society,
who reported in 1832 on experiments in which no less
than 41 different pendulums were swung in vacuo,
and their characteristics
determined.
[35] In 1836,
Baily undertook to advise the American Lt. Charles
Wilkes, who was to head the United States Exploring
[318]
Expedition of 1838-1842, on the procurement of
pendulums for this voyage. Wilkes ordered from the
London instrument maker, Thomas Jones, two unusual
pendulums, which Wilkes described as &ldquo;those
considered the best form by Mr. Baily for traveling
pendulums,&rdquo; and which Baily, himself, described as
&ldquo;precisely the same as the two invariable pendulums
belonging to this [Royal Astronomical] Society,&rdquo;
except for the location of the knife edges.




Figure 15.&mdash;One of Francis Baily&rsquo;s pendulums
(621/2 inches long), shown on the left, is now in the
possession of the Science Museum, London, and,
right, two views of a similar pendulum (375/8 inches
long) made in the late 19th century by Edward
KÃ¼bel, Washington, D.C., which is no. 316,876 in
the collection of the U.S. National Museum.
Among a large number of pendulums tried by
Baily in London (1827-1840), was one which
resembles the reversible pendulum superficially, but
which is actually an invariable pendulum having
knife edges at both ends. The purpose was apparently
economy, since it is equivalent to two separate
invariable pendulums. This is the type of pendulum
used on the U.S. Exploring Expedition of
1838-1842. It is not known what use was made of
the KÃ¼bel pendulum.


The unusual feature of these pendulums was in
their symmetry of mass as well as of form. They were
made of bars, of iron in one case, and of brass in the
other, and each had two knife edges at opposite ends
equidistant from the center. Thus, although they
resembled reversible pendulums, their symmetry of
mass prevented their use as such, and they were rather
equivalent to four separate invariable
pendulums.
[36]

Wilkes was taught the use of the pendulum by
Baily, and conducted experiments at Baily&rsquo;s house,
where the latter had carried out the work reported on
in 1832. The subsequent experiments made on the
U.S. Exploring Expedition were under the charge of
Wilkes, himself, who made observations on 11 separate
occasions, beginning with that in London (1836) and
followed by others in New York, Washington, D.C.,
Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, Honolulu, &ldquo;Pendulum Peak&rdquo;
(Mauna Loa), Mount Kanoha, Nesqually (Oregon
Territory), and, finally, two more times in Washington,
D.C. (1841 and 1845).

Wilkes&rsquo; results were communicated to Baily, who
appears to have found the work defective because of
insufficient attention to the maintenance of temperature
constancy and to certain alterations made to the
pendulums.
[37]
The results were also to have been
included in the publications of the Expedition, but
were part of the unpublished 24th volume. Fortunately
they still exist, in what appears to be a
printer&rsquo;s proof.
[38]

The Kater invariable pendulums were used to
investigate the internal constitution of the earth.
Airy sought to determine the density of the earth by
observing the times of swing of pendulums at the top
and bottom of a mine. The first experiments were
made in 1826 at the Dolcoath copper mine in Cornwall,
and failed when the pendulum fell to the bottom.
[319]
In 1854, the experiments were again undertaken in the
Harton coalpit, near Sunderland.
[39] Gravity at the
surface was greater than below, because of the attraction
of a shell equal to the depth of the pit. From
the density of the shell as determined from specimens
of rock, Airy found the density of the earth to be 61/2
times greater than that of water. T. C. Mendenhall,
in 1880, used a Kater convertible pendulum in an
invariable manner to compare values of gravity on
Fujiyama and at Tokyo, Japan.
[40] He used a &ldquo;simple&rdquo;
pendulum of the Borda type to determine the absolute
value of gravity at Tokyo. From the values of gravity
on the mountain and at Tokyo, and an estimate of
the volume of the mountain, he estimated the mean
density of the earth as 5.77 times greater than that
of water.

In 1879, Maj. J. Herschel, R.E., stated:

The years from 1840 to 1865 are a complete blank, if
we except Airy&rsquo;s relative density experiments in 1854.
This pause was broken simultaneously in three different
ways. Two pendulums of the Kater pattern were sent
to India; two after Bessel&rsquo;s design were set to work in
Russia; and at Geneva, Plantamour&rsquo;s zealous experiments
with a pendulum of the same kind mark the
commencement of an era of renewed activity on the
European continent.
[41]

With the statement that Kater invariable pendulums
nos. 4 and 6 (1821) were used in India between 1865
and 1873, we now consider the other events mentioned
by Herschel.




[320]
Repsold-Bessel Reversible Pendulum


As we have noted, Bessel made determinations of
gravity with a ball (&ldquo;simple&rdquo;) pendulum in the
period 1825-1827 and in 1835 at KÃ¶nigsberg and
Berlin, respectively. In the memoir on his observations
at KÃ¶nigsberg, he set forth the theory of the
symmetrical compound pendulum with interchangeable
knife edges.
[42] Bessel demonstrated theoretically
that if the pendulum were symmetrical with respect
to its geometrical center, if the times of swing about
each axis were the same, the effects of buoyancy and
of air set in motion would be eliminated. Laplace
had already shown that the knife edge must be
regarded as a cylinder and not as a mere line of
support. Bessel then showed that if the knife edges
were equal cylinders, their effects were eliminated
by inverting the pendulum; and if the knife edges
were not equal cylinders, the difference in their effects
was canceled by interchanging the knives and again
determining the times of swing in the so-called erect
and inverted positions. Bessel further showed that
it is unnecessary to make the times of swing exactly
equal for the two knife edges.

The simplified discussion for infinitely small oscillations
in a vacuum is as follows: If T1 and T2
are the times of swing about the knife edges, and if
h1 and h2 are distances of the knife edges from the
center of gravity, and if k is the radius of gyration
about an axis through the center of gravity, then
from the equation of motion of a rigid body oscillating
about a fixed axis under gravity T12 = &#960;2(k2 + h12)/gh1,
T22 = &#960;2(k2 + h22)/gh2. Then (h1T12
- h2T22)/(h1 - h2) = (&#960;2/g)(h1 + h2) = &#964;2.

&#964; is then the time of swing of a simple pendulum
of length h1 + h2.
If the difference T1 - T2
is sufficiently
small, &#964; = (h1T1 - h2T2)/(h1 - h2).
Prior to its publication by Bessel in 1828, the formula for the time of
swing of a simple pendulum of length h1 + h2 in terms
of T1, T2 had been given by C. F. Gauss in a letter
to H. C. Schumacher dated November 28, 1824.[43]

The symmetrical compound pendulum with interchangeable
knives, for which Bessel gave a posthumously
published design and specifications,[44] has
been called a reversible pendulum; it may thereby
be distinguished from Kater&rsquo;s unsymmetrical convertible
pendulum. In 1861, the Swiss Geodetic
Commission was formed, and in one of its first sessions
in 1862 it was decided to add determinations of
gravity to the operations connected with the measurement&mdash;at
different points in Switzerland&mdash;of the arc of the meridian
traversing central Europe.
[45] It was decided further to employ a
reversible pendulum of Bessel&rsquo;s design and to have it constructed
by the firm of A. Repsold and Sons, Hamburg. It was also
decided to make the first observations with the pendulum
in Geneva; accordingly, the Repsold-Bessel pendulum
(fig.&nbsp;16) was sent to Prof. E. Plantamour,
director of the observatory at Geneva, in the autumn
of 1864.
[46]

The Swiss reversible pendulum was about 560 mm.
in length (distance between the knife edges) and the
time of swing was approximately 3/4-second. At the
extremities of the stem of the pendulum were movable
cylindrical disks, one of which was solid and heavy,
the other hollow and light. It was intended by the
mechanicians that equality of times of oscillation
about the knife edges would be achieved by adjusting
the position of a movable disk. The pendulum was
hung by a knife edge on a plate supported by a
tripod and having an attachment from which a
measuring rod could be suspended so that the distance
between the knife edges could be measured by a
comparator. Plantamour found it impracticable to
adjust a disk until the times of swing about each
knife edge were equal. His colleague, Charles
CellÃ©rier,
[47]
[321]
then showed that if (T1 - T2)/T1 is sufficiently
small so that one can neglect its square, one can
determine the length of the seconds pendulum from
the times of swing about the knife edges by a theory
which uses the distances of the center of gravity from
the respective knife edges. Thus, a role for the position
of the center of gravity in the theory of the
reversible pendulum, which had been set forth earlier
by Bessel, was discovered independently by CellÃ©rier
for the Swiss observers of pendulums.

In 1866, Plantamour published an extensive memoir
&ldquo;ExpÃ©riences faites Ã  GenÃ¨ve avec le pendule
Ã  rÃ©version.&rdquo;
Another memoir, published in 1872, presented
further results of determinations of gravity
in Switzerland. Plantamour was the first scientist
in western Europe to use a Repsold-Bessel reversible
pendulum and to work out methods for its employment.

The Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences acquired
two Repsold-Bessel pendulums, and observations
with them were begun in 1864 by Prof. Sawitsch,
University of St. Petersburg, and
others.
[48] In 1869,
the Russian pendulums were loaned to the India
Survey in order to enable members of the Survey to
supplement observations with the Kater invariable
pendulums nos. 4 and 6 (1821). During the transport
of the Russian apparatus to India, the knives became
rusted and the apparatus had to be reconditioned.
Capt. Heaviside of the India Survey observed with
both pendulums at Kew Observatory, near London,
in the spring of 1874, after which the Russian pendulums
were sent to Pulkowa (Russia) and were
used for observations there and in the Caucasus.

The introduction of the Repsold-Bessel reversible
pendulum for the determination of gravity was
accompanied by the creation of the first international
scientific association, one for geodesy. In 1861, Lt.
Gen. J. J. Baeyer, director of the Prussian Geodetic
Survey, sent a memorandum to the Prussian minister
of war in which he proposed that the independent
geodetic surveys of the states of central Europe be
coordinated by the creation of an international
organization.
[49]
In 1862, invitations were sent to the
various German states and to other states of central
Europe. The first General Conference of the association,
initially called Die Mittel-EuropÃ¤ische Gradmessung,
also L&rsquo;Association GÃ©odÃ©sique Internationale, was
[322]
held from the 15th to the 22d of October 1864 in
Berlin.
[50]
The Conference decided upon questions
of organization: a general conference was to be held
ordinarily every three years; a permanent commission
initially consisting of seven members was to be the
scientific organ of the association and to meet annually;
a central bureau was to be established for the
reception, publication, and distribution of reports
from the member states.




Figure 16.&mdash;From a Design Left by Bessel, this portable apparatus
was developed in 1862 by the firm of Repsold in Hamburg, whose founder
had assisted Bessel in the construction of his pendulum apparatus of
1826. The pendulum is convertible, but differs from Kater&rsquo;s in
being geometrically symmetrical and, for this reason, Repsold&rsquo;s is
usually called &ldquo;reversible.&rdquo; Just to the right of the
pendulum is a standard scale. To the left is a &ldquo;vertical
comparator&rdquo; designed by Repsold to measure the distance between
the knife edges of the pendulum. To make this measurement, two
micrometer microscopes which project horizontally through the comparator
are alternately focused on the knife edges and on the standard scale.



Under the topic &ldquo;Astronomical Questions,&rdquo; the General
Conference of 1864 resolved that there should be determinations of the
intensity of gravity at the greatest possible number of points of the
geodetic network, and recommended the reversible pendulum as the
instrument of observation.
[51] At the
second General Conference, in Berlin in 1867, on the
basis of favorable reports by Dr. Hirsch, director of
the observatory at NeuchÃ¢tel, of Swiss practice with
the Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum, this instrument
was specifically recommended for determinations
of gravity.
[52] The
title of the association was
changed to Die EuropÃ¤ische Gradmessung; in 1886, it
became Die Internationale Erdmessung, under which
title it continued until World War I.

On April 1, 1866, the Central Bureau of Die EuropÃ¤ische
Gradmessung was opened in Berlin under the
presidency of Baeyer, and in 1868 there was founded
at Berlin, also under his presidency, the Royal
Prussian Geodetic Institute, which obtained regular
budgetary status on January 1, 1870. A reversible
pendulum for the Institute was ordered from A.
Repsold and Sons, and it was delivered in the spring
of 1869. The Prussian instrument was symmetrical
geometrically, as specified by Bessel, but different in
form from the Swiss and Russian pendulums. The
distance between the knife edges was 1 meter, and
the time of swing approximately 1 second. The
Prussian Repsold-Bessel pendulum was swung at
Leipzig and other stations in central Europe during
the years 1869-1870 by Dr. Albrecht under the
direction of Dr. Bruhns, director of the observatory
at Leipzig and chief of the astronomical section of the
Geodetic Institute. The results of these first observations
appeared in a publication of the Royal Prussian
Geodetic Institute in 1871.
[53]

Results of observations with the Russian Repsold-Bessel
pendulums were published by the Imperial
Academy of Sciences. In 1872, Prof. Sawitsch
reported the work for western Europeans in &ldquo;Les
variations de la pesanteur dans les provinces occidentales
de l&rsquo;Empire russe.&rdquo;[48] In November 1873, the
Austrian Geodetic Commission received a Repsold-Bessel
reversible pendulum and on September 24,
1874, Prof. Theodor von Oppolzer reported on observations
at Vienna and other stations to the Fourth
General Conference of Die EuropÃ¤ische Gradmessung in
Dresden.[54] At the fourth session of the Conference,
on September 28, 1874, a Special Commission,
consisting of Baeyer, as chairman, and Bruhns, Hirsch,
Von Oppolzer, Peters, and Albrecht, was appointed
to consider (under Topic 3 of the program): &ldquo;Observations
for the determination of the intensity of
gravity,&rdquo; the question, &ldquo;Which Pendulum-apparatuses
are preferable for the determination of many points?&rdquo;

After the adoption of the Repsold-Bessel reversible
pendulum for gravity determinations in Europe, work
in the field was begun by the U.S. Coast Survey under
the superintendency of Prof. Benjamin Peirce. There
is mention in reports of observations with pendulums
prior to Peirce&rsquo;s direction to his son Charles on November
30, 1872, &ldquo;to take charge of the Pendulum Experiments
of the Coast Survey and to direct and inspect all
parties engaged in such experiments and as often
as circumstances will permit, to take the field with
a party&#8230;.&rdquo;
[55] Systematic and important gravity
work by the Survey was begun by Charles Sanders
[323]
Peirce. Upon receiving notice of his appointment,
the latter promptly ordered from the Repsolds a
pendulum similar to the Prussian instrument. Since
the firm of mechanicians was engaged in making
instruments for observations of the transit of Venus in
1874, the pendulum for the Coast Survey could not be
constructed immediately. Meanwhile, during the
years 1873-1874, Charles Peirce conducted a party
which made observations of gravity in the Hoosac
Tunnel near North Adams, and at Northampton and
Cambridge, Massachusetts. The pendulums used
were nonreversible, invariable pendulums with conical
bobs. Among them was a silver pendulum, but
similar pendulums of brass were used
also.
[56]





Figure 17.&mdash;Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum apparatus
as made in 1875, and used in the gravity work of
the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Continental
geodesists continued to favor the general use of convertible
pendulums and absolute determinations of gravity, while
their English colleagues had turned to invariable pendulums
and relative determinations, except for base stations.
Perhaps the first important American contribution to
gravity work was C. S. Peirce&rsquo;s demonstration of the
error inherent in the Repsold apparatus through flexure
of the stand.





Figure 18.&mdash;Charles
Sanders Peirce (1839-1914),
son of Benjamin Peirce, Perkins Professor of
Astronomy and Mathematics at Harvard College.
C. S. Peirce graduated from Harvard in 1859.
From 1873 to 1891, as an assistant at the U.S.
Coast and Geodetic Survey, he accomplished the
important gravimetric work described in this article.
Peirce was also interested in many other fields,
but above all in the logic, philosophy, and history
of science, in which he wrote extensively. His
greatest fame is in philosophy, where he is regarded
as the founder of pragmatism.



[324]

In 1874, Charles Peirce expressed the desire to be
sent to Europe for at least a year, beginning about
March 1, 1875, &ldquo;to learn the use of the new convertible
pendulum and to compare it with those of the European
measure of a Degree and the Swiss and to compare&rdquo;
his &ldquo;invariable pendulums in the manner which
has been used by swinging them in London and
Paris.&rdquo;
[57]

Charles S. Peirce, assistant, U.S. Coast Survey,
sailed for Europe on April 3, 1875, on his mission to
obtain the Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum ordered
for the Survey and to learn the methods of
using it for the determination of gravity. In England,
he conferred with Maxwell, Stokes, and Airy concerning
the theory and practice of research with
pendulums. In May, he continued on to Hamburg
and obtained delivery from the Repsolds of the pendulum
for the Coast Survey (fig.&nbsp;17). Peirce then
went to Berlin and conferred with Gen. Baeyer, who
expressed doubts of the stability of the Repsold stand
for the pendulum. Peirce next went to Geneva,
where, under arrangements with Prof. Plantamour,
he swung the newly acquired pendulum at the
observatory.
[58]

In view of Baeyer&rsquo;s expressed doubts of the rigidity
of the Repsold stand, Peirce performed experiments
to measure the flexure of the stand caused by the
oscillations of the pendulum. His method was to set
up a micrometer in front of the pendulum stand and,
with a microscope, to measure the displacement
caused by a weight passing over a pulley, the friction
of which had been determined. Peirce calculated
the correction to be applied to the length of the seconds
pendulum&mdash;on account of the swaying of the stand
during the swings of the pendulum&mdash;to amount to
over 0.2 mm. Although Peirce&rsquo;s measurements of
flexure in Geneva were not as precise as his later
measurements, he believed that failure to correct for
flexure of the stand in determinations previously made
with Repsold pendulums was responsible for appreciable
errors in reported values of the length of the
seconds pendulum.

The Permanent Commission of Die EuropÃ¤ische
Gradmessung met in Paris, September 20-29, 1875.
In conjunction with this meeting, there was held on
September 21 a meeting of the Special Commission
on the Pendulum. The basis of the discussion by the
Special Commission was provided by reports which
had been submitted in response to a circular sent
out by the Central Bureau to the members on
February 26, 1874.
[59]

Gen. Baeyer stated that the distance of 1 meter between
the knife edges of the Prussian Repsold-Bessel
pendulum made it unwieldy and unsuited for transport.
He declared that the instability of the stand
also was a source of error. Accordingly, Gen. Baeyer
expressed the opinion that absolute determinations
of gravity should be made at a control station by a
reversible pendulum hung on a permanent, and therefore
stable stand, and he said that relative values of
gravity with respect to the control station should be
obtained in the field by means of a Bouguer invariable
pendulum. Dr. Bruhns and Dr. Peters agreed with
Gen. Baeyer; however, the Swiss investigators,
Prof. Plantamour and Dr. Hirsch reported in defense
of the reversible pendulum as a field instrument, as
did Prof. von Oppolzer of Vienna. The circumstance
that an invariable pendulum is subject to changes in
length was offered as an argument in favor of the
reversible pendulum as a field instrument.

Peirce was present during these discussions by the
members of the Special Commission, and he reported
that his experiments at Geneva demonstrated that
the oscillations of the pendulum called forth a flexure
of the support which hitherto had been neglected.
The observers who used the Swiss and Austrian
Repsold pendulums contended, in opposition to
Peirce, that the Repsold stand was stable.

The outcome of these discussions was that the
Special Commission reported to the Permanent Commission
that the Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum,
except for some small changes, satisfied all requirements
for the determination of gravity. The Special
Commission proposed that the Repsold pendulums
of the several states be swung at the Prussian Eichungsamt
in Berlin where, as Peirce pointed out, Bessel
had made his determination of the intensity of gravity
with a ball pendulum in 1835. Peirce was encouraged
to swing the Coast Survey reversible pendulum at the
stations in France, England, and Germany where
[325]
Borda and Cassini, Kater, and Bessel, respectively,
had made historic determinations. The Permanent
Commission, in whose sessions Peirce also participated,
by resolutions adopted the report of the Special
Commission on the Pendulum.
[60]

During the months of January and February 1876,
Peirce conducted observations in the Grande Salle du
Meridien at the observatory in Paris where Borda,
Biot, and Capt. Edward Sabine had swung pendulums
early in the 19th century. He conducted observations
in Berlin from April to June 1876 and, by
experiment, determined the correction for flexure to
be applied to the value of gravity previously obtained
with the Prussian instrument. Subsequent observations
were made at Kew. After his return to the
United States on August 26, 1876, Peirce conducted
experiments at the Stevens Institute in Hoboken,
New Jersey, where he made careful measurements of
the flexure of the stand by statical and dynamical
methods. In Geneva, he had secured the construction
of a vacuum chamber in which the pendulum
could be swung on a support which he called the
Geneva support. At the Stevens Institute, Peirce
swung the Repsold-Bessel pendulum on the Geneva
support and determined the effect of different pressures
and temperatures on the period of oscillation of
the pendulum. These experiments continued into
1878.
[61]

Meanwhile, the Permanent Commission met October
5-10, 1876, in Brussels and continued the discussion
of the pendulum.
[62] Gen. Baeyer reported on
Peirce&rsquo;s experiments in Berlin to determine the flexure
of the stand. The difference of 0.18 mm. in the
lengths of the seconds pendulum as determined by
Bessel and as determined by the Repsold instrument
agreed with Peirce&rsquo;s estimate of error caused by
neglect of flexure of the Repsold stand. Dr. Hirsch,
speaking for the Swiss survey, and Prof. von Oppolzer,
speaking for the Austrian survey, contended, however,
that their stands possessed sufficient stability and that
the results found by Peirce applied only to the stands
and bases investigated by him. The Permanent Commission
proposed further study of the pendulum.

The Fifth General Conference of Die EuropÃ¤ische
Gradmessung was held from September 27 to October 2,
1877, in Stuttgart.
[63] Peirce had instructions from
Supt. Patterson of the U.S. Coast Survey to attend
this conference, and on arrival presented a letter of
introduction from Patterson requesting that he,
Peirce, be permitted to participate in the sessions.
Upon invitation from Prof. Plantamour, as approved
by Gen. IbaÃ±ez, president of the Permanent Commission,
Peirce had sent on July 13, 1877, from New
York, the manuscript of a memoir titled &ldquo;De
l&rsquo;Influence de la flexibilitÃ© du trÃ©pied sur l&rsquo;oscillation
du pendule Ã  rÃ©version.&rdquo; This memoir and others
by CellÃ©rier and Plantamour confirming Peirce&rsquo;s
work were published as appendices to the proceedings
of the conference. As appendices to Peirce&rsquo;s contribution
were published also two notes by Prof. von
Oppolzer. At the second session on September 29,
1877, when Plantamour reported that the work of
Hirsch and himself had confirmed experimentally
the independent theoretical work of CellÃ©rier and the
theoretical and experimental work of Peirce on
flexure, Peirce described his Hoboken experiments.

During the discussions at Stuttgart on the flexure
of the Repsold stand, HervÃ© Faye, president of the
Bureau of Longitudes, Paris, suggested that the swaying
of the stand during oscillations of the pendulum
could be overcome by the suspension from one support
of two similar pendulums which oscillated with equal
amplitudes and in opposite phases. This proposal
was criticized by Dr. Hirsch, who declared that exact
observation of passages of a &ldquo;double pendulum&rdquo;
would be difficult and that two pendulums swinging
so close together would interfere with each other.
The proposal of the double pendulum came up again at
the meeting of the Permanent Commission at Geneva
in 1879.
[64]
On February 17, 1879, Peirce had completed
a paper &ldquo;On a Method of Swinging Pendulums
for the Determination of Gravity, Proposed by M.
[326]
Faye.&rdquo; In this paper, Peirce presented the results
of an analytical mechanical investigation of Faye&rsquo;s
proposal. Peirce set up the differential equations,
found the solutions, interpreted them physically,
and arrived at the conclusion &ldquo;that the suggestion of
M. Faye &#8230; is as sound as it is brilliant and offers
some peculiar advantages over the existing method of
swinging pendulums.&rdquo;

In a report to Supt. Patterson, dated July 1879,
Peirce stated: &ldquo;I think it is important before making
a new pendulum apparatus to experiment with Faye&rsquo;s
proposed method.&rdquo;
[65] He wrote further: &ldquo;The
method proves to be perfectly sound in theory, and as
it would greatly facilitate the work it is probably
destined eventually to prevail. We must unfortunately
leave to other surveys the merit of practically
testing and introducing the new method, as our appropriations
are insufficient for us to maintain the leading
position in this matter, which we otherwise might
take.&rdquo; Copies of the published version of Peirce&rsquo;s
remarks were sent to Europe. At a meeting of the
Academy of Sciences in Paris on September 1, 1879,
Faye presented a report on Peirce&rsquo;s
findings.
[66] The
Permanent Commission met September 16-20, 1879,
in Geneva. At the third session on September 19,
by action of Gen. Baeyer, copies of Peirce&rsquo;s paper on
Faye&rsquo;s proposed method of swinging pendulums were
distributed. Dr. Hirsch again commented adversely
on the proposal, but moved that the question be
investigated and reported on at the coming General
Conference. The Permanent Commission accepted
the proposal of Dr. Hirsch, and Prof. Plantamour
was named to report on the matter at the General
Conference. At Plantamour&rsquo;s request, Charles CellÃ©rier
was appointed to join him, since the problem
essentially was a theoretical one.

The Sixth General Conference of Die EuropÃ¤ische
Gradmessung met September 13-16, 1880, in
Munich.
[67]
Topic III, part 7 of the program was entitled &ldquo;On Determinations
of Gravity through pendulum observations.
Which construction of a pendulum apparatus
corresponds completely to all requirements of science?
Special report on the pendulum.&rdquo;




Figure 19.&mdash;Three
pendulums used in early work
at the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Shown on
the left is the Peirce invariable; center, the Peirce
reversible; and, right, the Repsold reversible.
Peirce designed the cylindrical pendulum in 1881-1882
to study the effect of air resistance according
to the theory of G. G. Stokes on the motion of a
pendulum in a viscous field. Three examples of
the Peirce pendulums are in the U.S. National
Museum.


The conference received a memoir by
CellÃ©rier
[68] on
the theory of the double pendulum and a report by
Plantamour and CellÃ©rier.
[69] CellÃ©rier&rsquo;s mathematical
analysis began with the equations of Peirce and used
the latter&rsquo;s notation as far as possible. His general
discussion included the results of Peirce, but he
stated that the difficulties to be overcome did not
justify the employment of the &ldquo;double pendulum.&rdquo;
He presented an alternative method of correcting for
flexure based upon a theory by which the flexure
caused by the oscillation of a given reversible pendulum
could be determined from the behavior of an
auxiliary pendulum of the same length but of different
weight. This method of correcting for flexure was
recommended to the General Conference by Plantamour
and CellÃ©rier in their joint report. At the
fourth session of the conference on September 16,
1880, the problem of the pendulum was discussed
and, in consequence, a commission consisting of
Faye, Helmholtz, Plantamour (replaced in 1882 by
Hirsch), and Von Oppolzer was appointed to study
apparatus suitable for relative determinations of
gravity.

The Permanent Commission met September 11-15,
1882, at The Hague,
[70]
and at its last session appointed
Prof. von Oppolzer to report to the Seventh General
Conference on different forms of apparatus for the
determination of gravity. The Seventh Conference
met October 15-24, 1883, in Rome,
[71] and, at its
eighth session, on October 22, received a comprehensive,
critical review from Prof. von Oppolzer entitled
&ldquo;Ãber die Bestimmung der Schwere mit Hilfe
verschiedener
Apparate.&rdquo;
[72]
Von Oppolzer especially expounded
the advantages of the Bessel reversible
pendulum, which compensated for air effects by
symmetry of form if the times of swing for both
positions were maintained between the same amplitudes,
and compensated for irregular knife edges by
making them interchangeable. Prof. von Oppolzer
reviewed the problem of flexure of the Repsold stand
and stated that a solution in the right direction was
[327]
the proposal&mdash;made by Faye and theoretically
pursued by Peirce&mdash;to swing two pendulums from the
same stand with equal amplitudes and in opposite
phases, but that the proposal was not practicable.
He concluded that for absolute determinations of
gravity, the Bessel reversible pendulum was highly
appropriate if one swung two exemplars of different
weight from the same stand for the elimination of
flexure. Prof. von Oppolzer&rsquo;s important report recognized
that absolute determinations were less accurate
than relative ones, and should be conducted only at
special places.

The discussions initiated by Peirce&rsquo;s demonstration
of the flexure of the Repsold stand resulted, finally,
in the abandonment of the plan to make absolute
determinations of gravity at all stations with the
reversible pendulum.





Peirce and Defforges Invariable, Reversible Pendulums

The Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum was designed
and initially used to make absolute determinations
of gravity not only at initial stations such as
Kew, the observatory in Paris, and the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C., but also at stations
in the field. An invariable pendulum with a single
knife edge, however, is adequate for relative determinations.
As we have seen, such invariable pendulums
had been used by Bouguer and Kater, and after
the experiences with the Repsold apparatus had been
recommended again by Baeyer for relative determinations.
But an invariable pendulum is subject to
uncontrollable changes of length. Peirce proposed
to detect such changes in an invariable pendulum in
the field by combining the invariable and reversible
principles. He explained his proposal to Faye in a
letter dated July 23, 1880, and he presented it on
September 16, 1880, at the fourth session of the sixth
General Conference of Die EuropÃ¤ische Gradmessung,
in Munich.
[73]

As recorded in the Proceedings of the Conference,
Peirce wrote:


But I obviate it in making my pendulum both invariable
and reversible. Every alteration of the pendulum will
be revealed immediately by the change in the difference
of the two periods of oscillation in the two positions.
Once discovered, it will be taken account of by means
of new measures of the distance between the two supports.


[328]

Peirce added that it seemed to him that if the reversible
pendulum perhaps is not the best instrument to
determine absolute gravity, it is, on condition that
it be truly invariable, the best to determine relative
gravity. Peirce further stated that he would wish
that the pendulum be formed of a tube of drawn brass
with heavy plugs of brass equally drawn. The cylinder
would be terminated by two hemispheres; the
knives would be attached to tongues fixed near the
ends of the cylinder.

During the years 1881 and 1882, four invariable,
reversible pendulums were made after the design of
Peirce at the office of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic
Survey in Washington, D.C. The report of the superintendent
for the year 1880-1881 states:

A new pattern of the reversible pendulum has been invented,
having its surface as nearly as convenient in the
form of an elongated ellipsoid. Three of these instruments
have been constructed, two having a distance of
one meter between the knife edges and the third a distance
of one yard. It is proposed to swing one of the
meter pendulums at a temperature near 32&deg; F. at the
same time that the yard is swung at 60&deg; F., in order to
determine anew the relation between the yard and the
meter.
[74]

The report for 1881-1882 mentions four of these
Peirce pendulums.

A description of the Peirce invariable, reversible
pendulums was given by Assistant E. D. Preston in
&ldquo;Determinations of Gravity and the Magnetic Elements
in Connection with the United States Scientific
Expedition to the West Coast of Africa,
1889-90.&rdquo;
[75]
The invariable, reversible pendulum, Peirce
no. 4, now preserved in the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s
Museum of History and Technology (fig.&nbsp;34), may be
taken as typical of the meter pendulums: In the same
memoir, Preston gives the diameter of the tube as
63.7 mm., thickness of tube 1.5 mm., weight 10.680
kilograms, and distance between the knives 1.000
meter.

The combination of invariability and reversibility
in the Peirce pendulums was an innovation for relative
determinations. Indeed, the combination was
criticized by Maj. J. Herschel, R.E., of the Indian
Survey, at a conference on gravity held in Washington
in May 1882 on the occasion of his visit to the United
States for the purpose of connecting English and
American stations by relative determinations with
three Kater invariable pendulums. These three
pendulums have been designated as nos. 4, 6 (1821),
and 11.
[76]




Figure 20.&mdash;Support for the Peirce pendulum,
1889. Much of the work of C. S. Peirce was concerned
with the determination of the error introduced
into observations made with the portable apparatus
by the vibration of the stand with the pendulum.
He showed that the popular Bessel-Repsold apparatus
was subject to such an error. His own pendulums
were swung from a simple but rugged wooden
frame to which a hardened steel bearing was fixed.


Another novel characteristic of the Peirce pendulums
was the mainly cylindrical form. Prof. George
Gabriel Stokes, in a paper &ldquo;On the Effect of the
[329]
Internal Friction of Fluids on the Motion of
Pendulums&rdquo;
[77]
that was read to the Cambridge Philosophical
Society on December 9, 1850, had solved the hydrodynamical
equations to obtain the resistance to the
motions of a sphere and a cylinder in a viscous
fluid. Peirce had studied the effect of viscous
resistance on the motion of his Repsold-Bessel
pendulum, which was symmetrical in form but not
cylindrical. The mainly cylindrical form of his
pendulums (fig.&nbsp;19) permitted Peirce to predict
from Stokes&rsquo; theory the effect of viscosity and to
compare the results with experiment. His report
of November 20, 1889, in which he presented the
comparison of experimental results with the theory
of Stokes, was not published.
[78]

Peirce used his pendulums in 1883 to establish
a station at the Smithsonian Institution that was to
serve as the base station for the Coast and Geodetic
Survey for some years. Pendulum Peirce no. 1
was swung at Washington in 1881 and was then taken
by the party of Lieutenant Greely, U.S.A., on an
expedition to Lady Franklin Bay where it was swung
in 1882 at Fort Conger, Grinnell Land, Canada.
Peirce nos. 2 and 3 were swung by Peirce in 1882
at Washington, D.C.; Hoboken, New Jersey;
Montreal, Canada; and Albany, New York. Assistant
Preston took Peirce no. 3 on a U.S. eclipse
expedition to the Caroline Islands in 1883. Peirce
in 1885 swung pendulums nos. 2 and 3 at Ann
Arbor, Michigan; Madison, Wisconsin; and Ithaca,
New York. Assistant Preston in 1887 swung Peirce
nos. 3 and 4 at stations in the Hawaiian Islands,
and in 1890 he swung Peirce nos. 3 and 4 at stations
on the west coast of Africa.
[79]

The new pattern of pendulum designed by Peirce
was also adopted in France, after some years of
experience with a Repsold-Bessel pendulum. Peirce
in 1875 had swung his Repsold-Bessel pendulum at
the observatory in Paris, where Borda and Cassini,
and Biot, had made historic observations and where
Sabine also had determined gravity by comparison
with Kater&rsquo;s value at London. During the spring of
1880, Peirce made studies of the supports for the
pendulums of these earlier determinations and calculated
corrections to those results for hydrodynamic
effects, viscosity, and flexure. On June 14, 1880,
Peirce addressed the Academy of Sciences, Paris,
on the value of gravity at Paris, and compared his results
with the corrected results of Borda and Biot and
with the transferred value of Kater.
[80]

In the same year the French Geographic Service
of the Army acquired a Repsold-Bessel reversible
pendulum of the smaller type, and Defforges conducted
experiments with it.
[81] He introduced the
method of measuring flexure from the movement
of interference fringes during motion of the pendulum.
He found an appreciable difference between dynamical
and statical coefficients of flexure and
concluded that the &ldquo;correction formula of Peirce
and CellÃ©rier is suited perfectly to practice and
represents exactly the variation of period caused
by swaying of the support, on the condition that one
uses the statical coefficient.&rdquo; Defforges developed a
theory for the employment of two similar pendulums
of the same weight, but of different length, and hung
by the same knives. This theory eliminated the
flexure of the support and the curvature of the knives
from the reduction of observations.

Pendulums of 1-meter and of 1/2-meter distance
between the knife edges were constructed from
Defforges&rsquo; design by Brunner Brothers in Paris
(fig.&nbsp;21). These Defforges pendulums were cylindrical
in form with hemispherical ends like the Peirce
pendulums, and were hung on knives that projected
from the sides of the pendulum, as in some unfinished
Gautier pendulums designed by Peirce in 1883 in Paris.

telescope shown is part of an interferometer used to measure flexure of the support. One
mirror of the interferometer is attached to the pendulum support; the other to the separate
masonry pillar at the left.


[331]





Figure 22.&mdash;Because
of the greater simplicity of
its use, the invariable pendulum superseded the
convertible pendulum towards the end of the 19th
century, except at various national base stations
(Kew, Paris, Potsdam, Washington, D.C., etc.).
Shown here are, right to left, a pendulum of the
type used by Peirce at the Hoosac Tunnel in
1873-74, the Mendenhall 1/2-second pendulum of
1890, and the pendulum designed by Peirce in
1881-1882.





Figure 23.&mdash;The overall
size of portable pendulum
apparatus was greatly reduced with the introduction of
this 1/2-second apparatus in 1887, by the Austrian military
officer, Robert von Sterneck. Used with a vacuum
chamber not shown here, the apparatus is only about 2
feet high. Coincidences are observed by the reflection of
a periodic electric spark in two mirrors, one on the support
and the other on the pendulum itself.

C. Mendenhall (1841-1924).
Although largely self-educated, he became the first
professor of physics and mechanics at the Ohio
Agricultural and Mechanical College (later Ohio
State University), and was subsequently connected
with several other universities. In 1878, while
teaching at the Tokyo Imperial University in
Japan, he made gravity measurements between
Tokyo and Fujiyama from which he calculated
the mean density of the earth. While superintendent
of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey,
1889-94, he developed the pendulum apparatus
which bears his name.





Von Sterneck and Mendenhall Pendulums


While scientists who had used the Repsold-Bessel
pendulum apparatus discussed its defects and limitations
for gravity surveys, Maj. Robert von Sterneck
of Austria-Hungary began to develop an excellent
apparatus for the rapid determination of relative
values of gravity.
[82] Maj. von Sterneck&rsquo;s apparatus
contained a nonreversible pendulum 1/4-meter in
[332]
length, and 1/2-second time of swing. The pendulum
was hung by a single knife edge, which rested on a
plate that was supported by a tripod. The pendulum
was swung in a chamber from which air was exhausted
and which could be maintained at any desired
temperature. Times of swing were determined by the
observation of coincidences of the pendulum with
chronometer signals. In the final form a small
mirror was attached to the knife edge perpendicular
to the plane of vibration of the pendulum and a second
fixed mirror was placed close to it so that the two
mirrors were parallel when the pendulum was at rest.
The chronometer signals worked a relay that gave a
horizontal spark which was reflected into the telescope
from the mirrors. When the pendulum was at rest,
the image of the spark in both mirrors appeared on
the horizontal cross wire in the telescope, and during
oscillation of the pendulum the two images appeared
in that position upon coincidence. In view of the
reduced size of the pendulum, the chamber in which
it was swung was readily portable, and with an
improved method of observing coincidences, relative
determinations of gravity could be made with rapidity
and accuracy.

By 1887 Maj. von Sterneck had perfected his
apparatus, and it was widely adopted in Europe for
relative determinations of gravity. He used his
apparatus in extensive gravity surveys and also applied
it in the silver mines in Saxony and Bohemia, by the
previously described methods of Airy, for investigations
into the internal constitution of the earth.

On July 1, 1889, Thomas Corwin Mendenhall
became superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic
Survey. Earlier, he had been professor of
physics at the University of Tokyo and had directed
observations of pendulums for the determination of
gravity on Fujiyama and at Tokyo. Supt. Mendenhall,
with the cooperation of members of his staff in
Washington, designed a new pendulum apparatus
of the von Sterneck type, and in October 1890 he
ordered construction of the first model.
[83]

Like the Von Sterneck apparatus, the Mendenhall
pendulum apparatus employed a nonreversible, invariable
pendulum 1/4-meter in length and of slightly
more than 1/2-second in time of swing. Initially, the
knife edge was placed in the head of the pendulum
and hung on a fixed plane support, but after some
experimentation Mendenhall attached the plane
surface to the pendulum and hung it on a fixed knife
edge. An apparatus was provided with a set of
three pendulums, so that if discrepancies appeared
in the results, the pendulum at fault could be detected.
There was also a dummy pendulum which
carried a thermometer. A pendulum was swung
in a receiver in which the pressure and temperature
of the air were controlled. The time of swing was
measured by coincidences with the beat of a chronometer.
The coincidences were determined by an
optical method with the aid of a flash apparatus.

[333]




Figure 25.&mdash;Mendenhall&rsquo;s
1/4-meter (1/2-second) apparatus.
Shown on the left is the flash apparatus and, on the right, the vacuum
chamber within which the pendulum is swung. The flash apparatus consists
of a kerosene lantern and a telescope, mounted on a box containing an
electromagnetically operated shutter. The operation of the shutter is
controlled by a chronograph (not shown), so that it emits a slit of
light at regular intervals. The telescope is focused on two mirrors
within the apparatus, one fixed, the other attached to the top of the
pendulum. It is used to observe the reflection of the flashes from these
mirrors. When the two reflections are aligned, a &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo;
is marked on the chronograph tape. The second telescope attached to the
bottom of the vacuum chamber is for observing the amplitude of the pendulum swing.


The flash apparatus was contained in a light metal
box which supported an observing telescope and
which was mounted on a stand. Within the box was
an electromagnet whose coils were connected with a
chronometer circuit and whose armature carried a
long arm that moved two shutters, in both of which
were horizontal slits of the same size. The shutters
were behind the front face of the box, which also had
a horizontal slit. A flash of light from an oil lamp or
an electric spark was emitted from the box when the
circuit was broken, but not when it was closed. When
the circuit was broken a spring caused the arm to
rise, and the shutters were actuated so that the three
slits came into line and a flash of light was emitted.
A small circular mirror was set in each side of the
pendulum head, so that from either face of the pendulum
the image of the illuminated slit could be reflected
into the field of the observing telescope. A
similar mirror was placed parallel to these two mirrors
and rigidly attached to the support. The chronometer
signals broke the circuit, causing the three slits
momentarily to be in line, and when the images of
the slit in the two mirrors coincided, a coincidence
was observed. A coincidence occurred whenever the
pendulum gained or lost one oscillation on the beat
[334]
of the chronometer. The relative intensity of gravity
was determined by observations with the first
Mendenhall apparatus at Washington, D.C., at stations
on the Pacific Coast and in Alaska, and at the
Stevens Institute, Hoboken, New Jersey, between
March and October 1891.




Figure 26.&mdash;Vacuum receiver
within which the Mendenhall pendulum is swung. The pressure
is reduced to about 50 mm. to reduce the disturbing effect of air resistance. When
the apparatus is sealed, the pendulum is lifted on the knife edge by the lever q and is
started to swing by the lever r. The arc of swing is only about 1&deg;. The stationary mirror
is shown at g. The pendulum shown in outline in the center, is only about 9.7 inches long.


Under Supt. Mendenhall&rsquo;s direction a smaller, 1/4-second,
pendulum apparatus was also constructed
and tested, but did not offer advantages over the
1/2-second apparatus, which therefore continued in
use.

In accordance with Peirce&rsquo;s theory of the flexure
of the stand under oscillations of the pendulum,
determinations of the displacement of the receiver
of the Mendenhall apparatus
were part of a relative
determination of gravity by members of the Coast and
Geodetic Survey. Initially, a statical method was
used, but during 1908-1909 members of the Survey
adapted the Michelson interferometer for the determinations
of flexure during oscillations from the shift of
fringes.
[84]
The first Mendenhall pendulums were
made of bronze, but about 1920 invar was chosen
because of its small coefficient of expansion. About
1930, Lt. E. J. Brown of the Coast and Geodetic
Survey made significant improvements in the Mendenhall
apparatus, and the new form came to be known
as the Brown Pendulum Apparatus.
[85]

[335]




Figure 27.&mdash;The Michelson
interferometer. The horizontal component of the force
acting on the knife edge through the swinging pendulum causes the support to move in
unison with the pendulum, and thereby affects the period of the oscillation. This movement
is the so-called flexure of the pendulum support, and must be taken into account in
the most accurate observations.

In 1907, the Michelson interferometer was adapted
to this purpose by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. As shown here, the
interferometer, resting on a wooden beam, is introduced into the path of
a light beam reflected from a mirror on the vacuum chamber. Movement of
that mirror causes a corresponding movement in the interference fringes
in the interferometer, which can be measured.


The original Von Sterneck apparatus and that of
Mendenhall provided for the oscillation of one
pendulum at a time. After the adoption of the Von
Sterneck pendulum in Europe, there were developed
stands on which two or four pendulums hung at the
same time. This procedure provided a convenient
way to observe more than one invariable pendulum
at a station for the purpose of detecting changes in
length. Prof. M. Haid of Karlsruhe in 1896 described
a four-pendulum apparatus,
[86] and Dr. Schumann of
Potsdam subsequently described a two-pendulum
apparatus.
[87]

[336]




Figure 28.&mdash;Apparatus which
was developed in 1929 by the Gulf Research and Development
Company, Harmarville, Pennsylvania. It was designed to achieve an accuracy
within one ten-millionth of the true value of gravity, and represents the extreme development
of pendulum apparatus for relative gravity measurement. The pendulum was
designed so that the period would be a minimum. The case (the top is missing in this
photograph) is dehumidified and its temperature and electrostatic condition are controlled.
Specially designed pendulum-lifting and -starting
mechanisms are used. The problem of
flexure of the case is overcome by the Faye-Peirce method (see text) in which two
dynamically matched pendulums are swung simultaneously, 180&deg; apart in phase.


The multiple-pendulum apparatus then provided a
method of determining the flexure of the stand from
the action of one pendulum upon a second pendulum
hung on the same stand. This method of determining
the correction for flexure was a development from a
&ldquo;Wippverfahren&rdquo; invented at the Geodetic Institute
in Potsdam. A dynamometer was used to impart
periodic impulses to the stand, and the effect was
observed upon a pendulum initially at rest. Refinements
of this method led to the development of a
method used by Lorenzoni in 1885-1886 to determine
the flexure of the stand by action of an auxiliary
pendulum upon the principal pendulum. Dr. Schumann,
in 1899, gave a mathematical theory of such
determinations,[88] and in his paper cited the mathematical
methods of Peirce and CellÃ©rier for the theory of
Faye&rsquo;s proposal at Stuttgart in 1877 to swing two
similar pendulums on the same support with equal
amplitudes and in opposite phases.

[337]




Figure 29.&mdash;The Gulf pendulum is about 10.7 inches long, and has a period of .89 second.
It is made of fused quartz which is resistant to the influence of temperature change and to
the earth&rsquo;s magnetism. Quartz pendulums are subject to the influence of electrostatic
charge, and provision is made to counteract this through the presence of a radium salt in
the case. The bearings are made of Pyrex glass.


In 1902, Dr. P. FurtwÃ¤ngler[89] presented the mathematical
theory of coupled pendulums in a paper in
which he referred to Faye&rsquo;s proposal of 1877 and reported
that the difficulties predicted upon its application
had been found not to occur. Finally, during the
gravity survey of Holland in the years 1913-1921, in
view of instability of supports caused by the mobility
of the soil, F. A. Vening Meinesz adopted Faye&rsquo;s
proposed method of swinging two pendulums on the
same support.
[90] The observations were made with
the ordinary StÃ¼ckrath apparatus, in which four Von
Sterneck pendulums swung two by two in planes
perpendicular to each other. This successful application
of the method&mdash;which had been proposed by
Faye and had been demonstrated theoretically to be
sound by Peirce, who also published a design for its
[338]
application&mdash;was rapidly followed for pendulum apparatus
for relative determinations by Potsdam,
[91]
Cambridge (England),
[92] Gulf Oil and Development
Company,
[93]
and the Dominion Observatory at
Ottawa.
[94]
Heiskanen and Vening Meinesz state:

The best way to eliminate the effect of flexure is to use
two synchronized pendulums of the same length swinging
on the same apparatus in the same plane and with
the same amplitudes but in opposite phases; it is clear
then the flexure is zero.
[95]

In view of the fact that the symmetrical reversible
pendulum is named for Bessel, who created the theory
and a design for its application by Repsold, it appears
appropriate to call the method of eliminating flexure
by swinging two pendulums on the same support the
Faye-Peirce method. Its successful application was
made possible by Maj. von Sterneck&rsquo;s invention of the
short, 1/4-meter pendulum.




Figure 30.&mdash;The accumulated data of gravity observations over the earth&rsquo;s
surface have indicated that irregularities such as mountains do not have
the effect which would be expected in modifying gravity, but are somehow
compensated for. The most satisfactory solution to this still unanswered
question has been the theory of isostasy, according to which variations in
the density of the material in the earth&rsquo;s crust produce a kind of hydrostatic
equilibrium between its higher and lower parts, as they &ldquo;float&rdquo; on the earth&rsquo;s
fluid core. The metals of different density floating in mercury in this
diagram illustrate isostasy according to the theory of Pratt and Hayford.



Absolute Value of Gravity at Potsdam


The development of the reversible pendulum in the
19th century culminated in the absolute determination
of the intensity of gravity at Potsdam by KÃ¼hnen
and FurtwÃ¤ngler of the Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute,
which then became the world base for gravity
surveys.
[96]

We have previously seen that in 1869 the Geodetic
Institute&mdash;founded by Lt. Gen. Baeyer&mdash;had acquired
a Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum which
was swung by Dr. Albrecht under the direction of
Dr. Bruhns. Dissatisfaction with this instrument was
expressed by Baeyer in 1875 to Charles S. Peirce,
who then, by experiment and mathematical analysis
of the flexure of the stand under oscillations of the
pendulum, determined that previously reported results
with the Repsold apparatus required correction.
Dr. F. R. Helmert, who in 1887 succeeded Baeyer as
director of the Institute, secured construction of a
building for the Institute in Potsdam, and under his
direction the scientific study of the intensity of gravity
was pursued with vigor. In 1894, it was discovered
in Potsdam that a pendulum constructed of very
flexible material yielded results which differed
markedly from those obtained with pendulums of
[339]
greater stiffness. Dr. KÃ¼hnen of the Institute discovered
that the departure from expectations was the
result of the flexure of the pendulum staff itself during
oscillations.
[97]

Peirce, in 1883, had discovered that the recesses cut
in his pendulums for the insertion of tongues that
carried the knives had resulted in the flexure of the
pendulum staff.
[98] By experiment, he also found an
even greater flexure for the Repsold pendulum. In
order to eliminate this source of error, Peirce designed
a pendulum with knives that extended from each
side of the cylindrical staff, and he received authorization
from the superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic
Survey to arrange for the construction of such
pendulums by Gautier in Paris. Peirce, who had
made his plans in consultation with Gautier, was
called home before the pendulums were completed,
and these new instruments remained undelivered.

In a memoir titled &ldquo;Effect of the flexure of a pendulum
upon its period of oscillation,&rdquo;
[99] Peirce determined
analytically the effect on the period of a pendulum
with a single elastic connection between two
rigid parts of the staff. Thus, Peirce discovered
experimentally the flexure of the staff and derived for
a simplified case the effect on the period. It is not
known if he ever found the integrated effect of the
continuum of elastic connections in the pendulum.
Lorenzoni, in 1896, offered a solution to the problem,
and Almansi, in 1899, gave an extended analysis.
After the independent discovery of the problem at
the Geodetic Institute, Dr. Helmert took up the problem
and criticized the theories of Peirce and Lorenzoni.
He then presented his own theory of flexure in
a comprehensive memoir.
[100] In view of the previous
neglect of the flexure of the pendulum staff in the
reduction of observations, Helmert directed that the
Geodetic Institute make a new absolute determination
of the intensity of gravity at Potsdam. For this
purpose, KÃ¼hnen and FurtwÃ¤ngler used the following
reversible pendulums which had been constructed
by the firm of A. Repsold and Sons in Hamburg:

1. The seconds pendulum of the Geodetic Institute
procured in 1869.

2. A seconds pendulum from the Astronomical Observatory,
Padua.

3. A heavy, seconds pendulum from the Imperial and
Royal Military-Geographical Institute, Vienna.

4. A light, seconds pendulum from the Imperial and
Royal Military-Geographical Institute.

5. A 1/2-second, reversible pendulum of the Geodetic
Institute procured in 1892.

Work was begun in 1898, and in 1906 KÃ¼hnen and
FurtwÃ¤ngler published their monumental memoir,
&ldquo;Bestimmung der Absoluten GrÃ¶sze der Schwerkraft
zu Potsdam mit Reversionspendeln.&rdquo;

The acceleration of gravity in the pendulum room
of the Geodetic Institute was determined to be 981.274
Â± 0.003 cm/sec2. In view of the exceptionally careful
and thorough determination at the Institute, Potsdam
was accepted as the world base for the absolute value
of the intensity of gravity. The absolute value of
gravity at some other station on the Potsdam system
was determined from the times of swing of an invariable
pendulum at the station and at Potsdam by the
relation T12/T22 =
g2/g1.
Thus, in 1900, Assistant G. R. Putnam of the Coast
and Geodetic Survey swung Mendenhall pendulums
at the Washington base and at Potsdam, and by transfer
from Potsdam determined the intensity of gravity
at the Washington base to be
980.112 cm/sec2.
[101]
In 1933, Lt. E. J. Brown made comparative measurements
with improved apparatus and raised the
value at the Washington base to
980.118 cm/sec2.
[102]

In view of discrepancies between the results of
various relative determinations, the Coast and Geodetic
Survey in 1928 requested the National Bureau
of Standards to make an absolute determination for
Washington. Heyl and Cook used reversible pendulums
made of fused silica having a period of
approximately 1 second. Their result, published in
1936, was interpreted to indicate that the value at
Potsdam was too high by 20 parts in
1 million.
[103]
This estimate was lowered slightly by Sir Harold
Jeffreys of Cambridge, England, who recomputed
the results of Heyl and Cook by different
methods.
[104]

the United States as of December 1908.

[342]

In 1939, J. S. Clark published the results of a
determination of gravity with pendulums of a non-ferrous
Y-alloy
[105]
at the National Physical Laboratory
at Teddington, England, and, after recomputation
of results by Jeffreys, the value was found to be
12.8 parts in 1 million less than the value obtained by
transfer from Potsdam. Dr. Hugh L. Dryden of the
National Bureau of Standards, and Dr. A. Berroth
of the Geodetic Institute at
Potsdam, have recomputed
the Potsdam data by different methods of adjustment
and concluded that the Potsdam value was too high
by about 12 parts in a million.
[106] Determination of
gravity at Leningrad by Russian scientists likewise
has indicated that the 1906 Potsdam value is too
high. In the light of present information, it
appears justifiable to reduce the Potsdam value of
981.274 by .013 cm/sec2 for purposes of comparison.
If the Brown transfer from Potsdam in 1933 was
taken as accurate, the value for the Washington base
would be 980.105 cm/sec2. In this connection, it is
of interest to note that the value given by Charles
S. Peirce for the comparable Smithsonian base in
Washington, as determined by him from comparative
methods in the 1880&rsquo;s and reported in the Annual
Report of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey
for the year 1890-1891, was
980.1017 cm/sec2.
[107] This
value would appear to indicate that Peirce&rsquo;s pendulums,
observations, and methods of reduction of data
were not inferior to those of the scientists of the
Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute at Potsdam.

Doubts concerning the accuracy of the Potsdam
value of gravity have stimulated many new determinations
of the intensity of gravity since the end of World
War II. In a paper published in June 1957, A. H.
Cook, Metrology Division, National Physical Laboratory,
Teddington, England, stated:

At present about a dozen new absolute determinations
are in progress or are being planned. Heyl and Cook&rsquo;s
reversible pendulum apparatus is in use in Buenos Aires
and further reversible pendulum experiments have been
made in the All Union Scientific Research Institute of
Metrology, Leningrad (V N I I M)
and are planned at
Potsdam. A method using a very long pendulum was
tried out in Russia about 1910 and again more recently
and there are plans for similar work in Finland. The
first experiment with a freely falling body was that
carried out by Volet who photographed a graduated
scale falling in an enclosure at low air pressure. Similar
experiments have been completed in Leningrad and
are in progress at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
(Brunswick) and at the National Research
Council (Ottawa), and analogous experiments are being
prepared at the National Physical Laboratory and at
the National Bureau of Standards. Finally, Professor
Medi, Director of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica
(Rome), is attempting to measure the focal length of
the paraboloidal surface of a liquid in a rotating
dish.
[108]



Application of Gravity Surveys

We have noted previously that in the ancient and
early modern periods, the earth was presupposed to
be spherical in form. Determination of the figure of
the earth consisted in the measurement of the radius
by the astronomical-geodetic method invented by
Eratosthenes. Since the earth was assumed to be
spherical, gravity was inferred to be constant over
the surface of the earth. This conclusion appeared
to be confirmed by the determination of the length
of the seconds pendulum at various stations in Europe
by Picard and others. The observations of Richer in
South America, the theoretical discussions of Newton
and Huygens, and the measurements of degrees of
latitude in Peru and Sweden demonstrated that the
earth is an oblate spheroid.




Figure 33.&mdash;Gravity characteristics of the globe.
Deductions as to the distribution of matter in the earth
can be made from gravity measurements. This globe
shows worldwide variations in gravity as they now appear
from observations at sea (in submarines) as well as on
land. It is based on data from the Institute of Geodesy
at Ohio State University.


The theory of gravitation and the theory of central
forces led to the result that the intensity of gravity
is variable over the surface of the earth. Accordingly,
[343]
determinations of the intensity of gravity became of
value to the geodesist as a means of determining
the figure of the earth. Newton, on the basis of the
meager data available to him, calculated the ellipticity
of the earth to be 1/230 (the ellipticity is defined by
(a-b)/a, where a is the equatorial radius and b the polar
radius). Observations of the intensity of gravity
were made on the historic missions to Peru and
Sweden. Bouguer and La Condamine found that at
the equator at sea level the seconds pendulum was
1.26 Paris-lines shorter than at Paris. Maupertuis
found that in northern Sweden a certain pendulum
clock gained 59.1 seconds per day on its rate in
Paris. Then Clairaut, from the assumption that the
earth is a spheroid of equilibrium, derived a theorem
from which the ellipticity of the earth can be derived
from values of the intensity of gravity.

[344]

Peirce (1873-1874), and Peirce (1881-1882); the double pendulum of Edward KÃ¼bel
(see fig.&nbsp;15, p. 319), and the reversible pendulum of Peirce. On the display counter, from

apparatus, the one on the right having a thermometer attached. At bottom, right, is
the Gulf apparatus (cover removed) mentioned in the text, shown with one quartz
pendulum.


[345]

Early in the 19th century a systematic series of
observations began to be conducted in order to determine
the intensity of gravity at stations all over
the world. Kater invariable pendulums, of which
13 examples have been mentioned in the literature,
were used in surveys of gravity by Kater, Sabine,
Goldingham, and other British pendulum swingers.
As has been noted previously, a Kater invariable
pendulum was used by Adm. LÃ¼tke of Russia on
a trip around the world. The French also sent
out expeditions to determine values of gravity.
After several decades of relative inactivity, Capts.
Basevi and Heaviside of the Indian Survey carried
out an important series of observations from 1865 to
1873 with Kater invariable pendulums and the
Russian Repsold-Bessel pendulums. In 1881-1882
Maj. J. Herschel swung Kater invariable pendulums
nos. 4, 6 (1821), and 11 at stations in England and
then brought them to the United States in order to
make observations which would connect American
and English base stations.
[109]

The extensive sets of observations of gravity provided
the basis of calculations of the ellipticity of the
earth. Col. A. R. Clarke in his Geodesy (London,
1880) calculated the ellipticity from the results of
gravity surveys to be 1/(292.2 Â± 1.5).
Of interest is the
calculation by Charles S. Peirce, who used only
determinations made with Kater invariable pendulums
and corrected for elevation, atmospheric effect,
and expansion of the pendulum through temperature.[110]
He calculated the ellipticity of the earth
to be 1/(291.5 Â± 0.9).

The 19th century witnessed the culmination of the
ellipsoidal era of geodesy, but the rapid accumulation
of data made possible a better approximation to the
figure of the earth by the geoid. The geoid is
defined as the average level of the sea, which is
thought of as extended through the continents.
The basis of geodetic calculations, however, is an
ellipsoid of reference for which a gravity formula
expresses the value of normal gravity at a point on
the ellipsoid as a function of gravity at sea level at
the equator, and of latitude. The general assembly
of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics,
which was founded after World War I to continue
the work of Die Internationale Erdmessung, adopted
in 1924 an international reference ellipsoid,
[111] of
which the ellipticity, or flattening, is Hayford&rsquo;s
value 1/297. In 1930, the general assembly adopted
a correlated International Gravity Formula of the form
&#947; = &#947;E(1 + &#946;(sin2 &#966;) + &#949;(sin2 2&#966;))
where &#947; is normal gravity at latitude &#966;, &#947;E is the
value of gravity at sea level at the equator, &#946; is a
parameter which is computed on the basis of Clairaut&rsquo;s
theorem from the flattening value of the meridian,
and &#949; is a constant which is derived theoretically.
The plumb line is perpendicular to the geoid, and
the components of angle between the perpendiculars
to geoid and reference ellipsoid are deflections of
the vertical. The geoid is above the ellipsoid of
reference under mountains and it is below the
ellipsoid on the oceans, where the geoid coincides
with mean sea level. In physical geodesy, gravimetric
data are used for the determination of the
geoid and components of deflections of the vertical.
For this purpose, one must reduce observed values
of gravity to sea level by various reductions, such as
free-air, Bouguer, isostatic reductions. If g0 is observed
gravity reduced to sea level and &#947; is normal gravity
obtained from the International Gravity Formula,
then &#916;g = g0 - &#947;
is the gravity anomaly.
[112]

In 1849, Stokes derived a theorem whereby the
distance N of the geoid from the ellipsoid of reference
can be obtained from an integration of gravity
anomalies over the surface of the earth. Vening
Meinesz further derived formulae for the calculation
of components of the deflection of the vertical.

Geometrical geodesy, which was based on astronomical-geodetic
methods, could give information
only concerning the external form of the figure of
the earth. The gravimetric
methods of physical
geodesy, in conjunction with methods such as those
of seismology, enable scientists to test hypotheses
concerning the internal structure of the earth.
Heiskanen and Vening Meinesz summarize the
present-day achievements of the gravimetric method of
[346]
physical geodesy by stating
[113] that it alone can give:

1. The flattening of the reference ellipsoid.

2. The undulations N of the geoid.

3. The components of the deflection of the vertical &#950;
and &#951; at any point, oceans and islands included.

4. The conversion of existing geodetic systems to the
same world geodetic system.

5. The reduction of triangulation base lines from the
geoid to the reference ellipsoid.

6. The correction of errors in triangulation in mountainous
regions due to the effect of the deflections of
the vertical.

7. Geophysical applications of gravity measurements,
e.g., the isostatic study of the earth&rsquo;s interior and the
exploration of oil fields and ore deposits.

With astronomical observations or with existing
triangulations, the gravimetric method can accomplish
further results. Heiskanen and Vening Meinesz state:

It is the firm conviction of the authors that the gravimetric
method is by far the best of the existing methods
for solving the main problems of geodesy, i.e., to determine
the shape of the geoid on the continents as well as

Summary

Since the creation of classical mechanics in the 17th
century, the pendulum has been a basic instrument for
the determination of the intensity of gravity, which is
expressed as the acceleration of a freely falling body.
Basis of theory is the simple pendulum, whose time of
swing under gravity is proportional to the square root
of the length divided by the acceleration due to
gravity. Since the length of a simple pendulum
divided by the square of its time of swing is equal to
the length of a pendulum that beats seconds, the intensity
of gravity also has been expressed in terms of
the length of the seconds pendulum. The reversible
compound pendulum has served for the absolute
determination of gravity by means of a theory developed
by Huygens. Invariable compound pendulums
with single axes also have been used to determine
relative values of gravity by comparative times
of swing.

The history of gravity pendulums begins with the
ball or &ldquo;simple&rdquo; pendulum of Galileo as an approximation
to the ideal simple pendulum. Determinations
of the length of the seconds pendulum by French
scientists culminated in a historic determination at
Paris by Borda and Cassini, from the corrected observations
with a long ball pendulum. In the 19th
century, Bessel found the length of the seconds pendulum
at KÃ¶nigsberg and Berlin by observations with
a ball pendulum and by original theoretical considerations.
During the century, however, the compound
pendulum came to be preferred for absolute and relative
determinations.

Capt. Henry Kater, at London, constructed the first
convertible compound for an absolute determination
of gravity, and then he designed an invariable compound
pendulum, examples of which were used for
relative determinations at various stations in Europe
and elsewhere. Bessel demonstrated theoretically the
advantages of a reversible compound pendulum which
is symmetrical in form and is hung by interchangeable
knives. The firm of A. Repsold and Sons in Hamburg
constructed pendulums from the specifications of
Bessel for European gravity surveys.

Charles S. Peirce in 1875 received delivery in Hamburg
of a Repsold-Bessel pendulum for the U.S. Coast
Survey and observed with it in Geneva, Paris, Berlin,
and London. Upon an initial stimulation from
Baeyer, founder of Die EuropÃ¤ische Gradmessung,
Peirce demonstrated by experiment and theory that
results previously obtained with the Repsold apparatus
required correction, because of the flexure of
the stand under oscillations of the pendulum. At
the Stuttgart conference of the geodetic association in
1877, HervÃ© Faye proposed to solve the problem of
flexure by swinging two similar pendulums from the
same support with equal amplitudes and in opposite
phases. Peirce, in 1879, demonstrated theoretically
the soundness of the method and presented a design
for its application, but the &ldquo;double pendulum&rdquo; was
rejected at that time. Peirce also designed and had
constructed four examples of a new type of invariable,
reversible pendulum of cylindrical form which made
possible the experimental study of Stokes&rsquo; theory of the
resistance to motion of a pendulum in a viscous fluid.
Commandant Defforges, of France, also designed and
used cylindrical reversible pendulums, but of different
length so that the effect of flexure was eliminated in
the reduction of observations. Maj. Robert von
Sterneck, of Austria-Hungary, initiated a new era in
gravity research by the invention of an apparatus with
a short pendulum for relative determinations of
gravity. Stands were then constructed in Europe on
[347]
which two or four pendulums were hung at the same
time. Finally, early in the present century, Vening
Meinesz found that the Faye-Peirce method of swinging
pendulums hung on a StÃ¼ckrath four-pendulum
stand solved the problem of instability due to the
mobility of the soil in Holland.

The 20th century has witnessed increasing activity
in the determination of absolute and relative values of
gravity. Gravimeters have been perfected and have
been widely used for rapid relative determinations,
but the compound pendulums remain as indispensable
instruments. Mendenhall&rsquo;s replacement of knives by
planes attached to nonreversible pendulums has been
used also for reversible ones. The Geodetic Institute at
Potsdam is presently applying the Faye-Peirce method
to the reversible pendulum.
[115] Pendulums have been
constructed of new materials, such as invar, fused
silica, and fused quartz. Minimum pendulums for
precise relative determinations have been constructed
and used. Reversible pendulums have been made with
&ldquo;I&rdquo; cross sections for better stiffness. With all these
modifications, however, the foundations of the present
designs of compound pendulum apparatus were
created in the 19th century.

For the account of the work of Peirce, the authors are greatly
indebted to this pioneer paper on Peirce&rsquo;s work on gravity. It
is worth noting that the history of pendulum work in North
America goes back to the celebrated Mason and Dixon, who
made observations of &ldquo;the going rate of a clock&rdquo; at &ldquo;the forks
of the river Brandiwine in Pennsylvania,&rdquo; in 1766-67. These
observations were published in Phil. Trans. (1768), vol. 58,

1895. A footnote states that Assistant O. H. Tittmann, who
represented the United States, subsequently reported Peirce&rsquo;s
prior discovery of the influence of the flexure of the pendulum
itself upon the period (Report of the Superintendent of the U.S.
Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1883-84, Washington, 1885, app.
16, pp. 483-485).

Paper 44 - Transcriber&rsquo;s Note

Formatting of equations has been altered from the original to display them
&lsquo;in line,&rsquo; and brackets have been added to clarify expressions where necessary.

Footnotes have been moved to the end of the paper. Illustrations and the
Glossary of Gravity Terminology section have been moved to avoid breaks
in paragraphs. Minor punctuation errors have been corrected without
note. Typographical errors and inconsistencies have been corrected as
follows:

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
