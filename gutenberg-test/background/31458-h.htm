<p>The Museum of Zoology, University of Utah, contains approximately
5000 specimens in addition to those available to Durrant
(1952) when he prepared his account of the "Mammals of Utah,
<i>Taxonomy and Distribution</i>." Study of this material discloses two
kinds of mammals not heretofore known to occur in Utah, and extends
the known limits of occurrence of many others as is set forth
below in what may be thought of as a supplement to the aforementioned
report of 1952.</p>

<p>Our study was financed in part by a grant from the National
Science Foundation.</p>

<p><i><b>Sorex vagrans obscurus</b></i> Merriam. Dusky Shrew.&mdash;Twelve specimens
are available from the Abajo Mountains and Elk Ridge, San
Juan County, Utah, as follows: North Creek, 6 mi. W Monticello,
8300 ft.; 1 mi. S Twin Peaks, 9500 ft.; Kigalia R. S., 8000 ft.; and
Gooseberry R. S., 8250 ft. Previously, the only known specimens
from east of the Colorado River in Utah were from the La Sal Mountains
in extreme eastern Grand County and extreme northern San
Juan County. These twelve specimens extend the known area of
occurrence of the species in Utah approximately 80 miles to the
south, and indicate that this shrew occurs throughout the state in
favorable habitats.</p>

<p><i><b>Sorex palustris navigator</b></i> (Baird). Water Shrew.&mdash;An individual
was observed by M. Raymond Lee at North Creek, seven miles
west of Monticello, Abajo Mountains, 8000 feet, San Juan County,
on July 10, 1954. Usually we are extremely reluctant to record
sight records, but do so in this instance because the water shrew
is so distinctive that it can be readily recognized and because the
occurrence extends the known range approximately 80 miles southward
in Utah. This individual was observed at close range while
swimming and foraging in North Creek, and there can be no doubt
of its identity.</p>

<p><i><b>Myotis yumanensis yumanensis</b></i> (H. Allen). Yuma Myotis.&mdash;Durrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
(1952:43) reported this subspecies from Utah on the authority
of Hardy (1941:289) who had specimens from two localities in
extreme southwestern Utah. Durrant (1952:41) referred specimen
Number 6784, from Willow Creek, 25 miles south of Ouray,
Uintah County, to <i>Myotis lucifugus carissima</i>. Restudy of this
specimen reveals that it is <i>Myotis yumanensis yumanensis</i>. This
identification has been corroborated by Dr. Philip H. Krutzsch,
University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and extends the known
range of the subspecies <i>M. y. yumanensis</i> approximately 300 miles
northeastward in Utah. See also Krutzsch and Heppenstall (1955:126)
who record specimens from 2 mi. SW Jensen.</p>

<p><i><b>Myotis subulatus melanorhinus</b></i> (Merriam). Small-footed Myotis.&mdash;This
bat previously was known from only seven localities in Utah,
which indicated that it occurred in only the western and southern
areas of the state. Four additional records are now available from
the following localities: Logan Canyon Cave, 15 miles north of
Logan, Cache County; Weber College Campus, Ogden, Weber
County; University of Utah Campus, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake
County; Six Mile Canyon, 3-1/2 miles east of Sterling, Sanpete County.
These occurrences extend the known range to the eastward in Utah,
and indicate a state-wide distribution. Specimens of the subspecies
<i>Myotis s. melanorhinus</i> are recorded also from as far north as
Double Springs, Custer County, Idaho (Davis, 1939:117).</p>

<p><i><b>Pipestrellus hesperus hesperus</b></i> (H. Allen). Western Pipistrelle.&mdash;Heretofore,
the northernmost known specimens of this bat from
Utah were from Old Lincoln Highway, 18 miles southwest of Orr's
Ranch, Tooele County. Specimen Number 7531 is now available
from cliffs NE [3 mi.] Ogden, Weber County, and extends the
known range of this species in Utah approximately 100 miles northeastward.
This pipistrelle probably inhabits all of northern and
northwestern Utah in suitable habitats. This probability is supported
by Davis' (1939:120) report of a specimen from Salmon
Creek, eight miles west of Rogerson, Twin Falls County, Idaho.
See also Krutzsch and Heppenstall (1955:127) who record a specimen
from, eastern Utah as far north as, Desert Springs which is
10 mi. SW Ouray, Uintah County.</p>

<p><i><b>Corynorhinus rafinesquii pallescens</b></i> Miller. Long-eared Bat.&mdash;Formerly,
the northernmost record of the long-eared bat in Utah
was from east of Springville, Utah County. Specimens are now
available from Goldhill, Tooele County, and from South Fork,
Ogden River, Weber County. Professor J. S. Stanford, Department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of Zoology, Utah State Agricultural College, informed us (by
letter) that this bat is the common cave bat in Logan Canyon,
Cache County. This northern extension of known area of occurrence
of approximately 100 miles indicates that it probably is state-wide
in distribution in suitable habitats. It can be inferred from
Hall (1946:161) that the range of <i>C. r. intermedius</i> in Nevada extended
northeastward into northwestern Utah, and Davis (1939:124)
reported specimens from Bingham and Bannock counties,
Idaho, that he referred to the above mentioned subspecies. This
led Stanford to comment (<i>in litt.</i>) that bats of this species from
northern Utah in Cache County might be <i>C. r. intermedius</i>. Insofar
as we are aware, <i>C. r. pallescens</i> differs from <i>C. r. intermedius</i> only
in being slightly paler. Our specimens from Goldhill and South
Fork of the Ogden River are not beyond the range of color of specimens
from elsewhere in the state that are referable to <i>C. r. pallescens</i>.
Inasmuch as specimens are not available from Logan
Canyon, we deem it best pending the acquisition of specimens from
that locality to refer all members of this species from Utah to the
subspecies <i>C. r. pallescens</i>.</p>

<p><i><b>Marmota flaviventer nosophora</b></i> Howell. Yellow-bellied Marmot.&mdash;Durrant
(1952:101) did not indicate that any species of the
genus <i>Marmota</i> occurred on the mountains within the basin of
Pleistocene Lake Bonneville. Furthermore, he commented (<i>op.
cit.</i>:502) upon the dearth of sciurids within this basin. One specimen,
No. 10,905, of the subspecies <i>M. f. nosophora</i> has been taken
from South Willow Canyon, 10,000 feet, base of Deseret Peak,
Stansbury Mountains, Tooele County. This specimen is noteworthy
not only in that it extends the known range of this kind of mammal
50 miles to the west in Utah, but in that it is well within the basin
of the ancient lake. The marmot is common in the Wasatch Mountains
on the eastern mainland of Lake Bonneville, but to date has
not been found on the Oquirrh Mountains immediately to the west.
The Oquirrh Mountains are interposed between the Stansbury and
Wasatch mountains. The presence of the marmot on the Stansbury
Mountains indicates that it probably occurs also on the
Oquirrh Mountains.</p>

<p><i><b>Citellus beldingi crebrus</b></i> Hall. Belding Ground Squirrel.&mdash;Durrant
(1952:113) had only two specimens of this ground squirrel
from Standrod, Boxelder County. Additional specimens have been
obtained from the following localities in northwestern Boxelder
County: Grouse Creek, Park Valley, Grouse Creek Mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
12 miles northwest of Grouse Creek, and Goose Creek. <i>C. b. crebrus</i>
now is known to inhabit all the major drainages of the Raft
River, Goose Creek, and Grouse Creek mountains. In addition to
extending the known area of occurrence of this animal in Utah,
these specimens prove also that this species is not restricted to the
Snake River Drainage as Durrant (1952:113) supposed, but occurs
also in the Great Basin Drainage.</p>

<p><i><b>Citellus richardsonii elegans</b></i> (Kennicott). Richardson Ground
Squirrel.&mdash;Recently, Hansen (1953:132) reported on specimens of
this species from Rich and Summit counties. Additional specimens
are now available from Highway 165 [2 mi. E Summit&mdash;Daggett
Co. Line], 2 miles south of Utah-Wyoming State Line; 5 miles west
of Manila, and one mile northeast of Manila (Carnegie Museum).
These localities are in Daggett County. The occurrence of these
ground squirrels in Rich, Summit and Daggett counties suggests
that they occur along the entire northern piedmont of the Uinta
Mountains.</p>

<p><i><b>Citellus lateralis trepidus</b></i> (Taylor). Golden-mantled Ground
Squirrel.&mdash;Durrant (1952:126) estimated that practically all of the
area in Utah that is within the Great Basin might be included in
the range of this subspecies. Actually, he had specimens from only
the Raft River Mountains in northwestern Boxelder County. He
included sight records from the Deep Creek Mountains and from
the Oquirrh Mountains. Subsequently two specimens, numbers
7469A and 7470A, were obtained from the Deep Creek Mountains.
To date neither specimens nor subsequent sight records have been
obtained from the Oquirrh Mountains, and we are of the opinion
that Durrant erred, and that the golden-mantled ground squirrel
does not inhabit these mountains. Therefore, it seems at this writing
that this subspecies, in Utah, occurs only in the extreme western
and northwestern parts of the state in the Deep Creek and Raft
River mountains, and not within the basin of Pleistocene Lake
Bonneville as formerly supposed.</p>

<p><i><b>Eutamias umbrinus umbrinus</b></i> (J. A. Allen). Uinta Chipmunk.&mdash;Two
specimens, numbers 10,236 and 10,237, from the junction of
Argyle and Minnie Maud creeks, Carbon County, prove that members
of this subspecies occur on the West Tavaputs Plateau, which
is outside the range ascribed to this subspecies by White (1953:572)
and by Durrant (1952:142). The grayish color of these specimens
and the reduction of ochraceous pigments constitute basis for referring
the specimens to <i>E. u. umbrinus</i>, and not to <i>E. u. adsitus</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
<i>E. u. montanus</i>. <i>E. u. umbrinus</i> on the West Tavaputs Plateau is
separated from <i>E. u. montanus</i> on the East Tavaputs Plateau by the
Green River and its deep chasm.</p>

<p><i><b>Perognathus formosus incolatus</b></i> Hall. Long-tailed Pocket Mouse.&mdash;Prior
to the description of this subspecies by Hall (1941:56),
animals of this species had not been reported from within the basin
of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville. When Durrant (1952) prepared
his manuscript he had but a single specimen from western Millard
County and one nearby record (Fautin, 1946:280). Additional
specimens are known from the following localities: junction of
Trout Creek and Birch Creek, Deep Creek Mountains, Tooele
County; six miles north of Ibapah, Tooele County; five miles south
of Timpie, Tooele County; north end of Newfoundland Mountains,
Boxelder County; and Groome, Boxelder County. These occurrences
show that the species is not restricted to the extreme western
part of the state, but occurs in suitable habitats throughout the
basin of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville. The known range is extended
approximately 150 miles north and 40 miles east.</p>

<p><i><b>Perognathus parvus trumbullensis</b></i> Benson. Great Basin Pocket
Mouse.&mdash;Durrant (1952:477), suspecting that this mouse occurred
in Utah, included the subspecies <i>P. p. trumbullensis</i> in his hypothetical
list. Numerous specimens are now available from the following
localities: Pine Valley Mountains, Enterprise Reservoir,
and 19 miles west of Enterprise, Washington County; Bown's Reservoir,
Snow Ranch, Hall Ranch, Steep Creek, Garfield County;
Aquarius Guard Station, Aquarius Plateau, Wayne County. Insofar
as we are aware, these occurrences are the first to be recorded
from Utah, and extend the known range of this subspecies 150 miles
northward.</p>

<p>The specimens from Washington County are paler than those
from Garfield County, and this pallor indicates intergradation with
the subspecies <i>P. p. olivaceus</i>. Of animals from the Aquarius Plateau,
those from the eastern and southern localities are pale and
have a marked suffusion of ochraceous in the upper parts, whereas
those from the western and northern localities are extremely dark
owing to a heavy suffusion of black in the upper parts. The skulls
of animals from the Aquarius Plateau resemble those of <i>P. p. trumbullensis</i>
in the majority of diagnostic characters. In some few
characters, nevertheless, the skulls resemble those of <i>P. p. olivaceus</i>,
and in other characters are intermediate between these two named
subspecies. In shape and size of the interparietal, in slightly longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
nasals, and in slightly greater alveolar length of upper molariform
teeth, animals from the Aquarius Plateau differ from either of the
aforementioned subspecies. All characters considered, we deem it
best to refer these specimens to the subspecies <i>P. p. trumbullensis</i>.</p>

<p><i><b>Thomomys talpoides bridgeri</b></i> Merriam. Northern Pocket Gopher.&mdash;An
adult female, Catalogue No. 25667 of the Museum of Natural
History of the University of Kansas, skin with skull, was trapped,
on 30 June 1948, 14 miles south and 2 miles east of Robertson, 9,300
feet, in Summit County, Utah, by James O. Lonnquist (original
number 146). This is the first record of this subspecies from Utah,
and raises to 37 the named kinds of pocket gophers known from
Utah.</p>

<p><i><b>Reithrodontomys megalotis megalotis</b></i> (Baird). Western Harvest
Mouse.&mdash;Durrant (1952:295) reported no harvest mice from the
Uinta Basin in northeastern Utah. One specimen, No. 10,239, was
obtained from two miles east of Duchesne, Duchesne County. This
specimen extends the known range in Utah 50 miles northward,
and indicates that the harvest mouse of the subspecies <i>R. m. megalotis</i>
occurs throughout the Uinta Basin.</p>

<p><i><b>Onychomys leucogaster pallescens</b></i> Merriam. Northern Grasshopper
Mouse.&mdash;Hansen obtained specimens (in alcohol) from Kennedys
Hole, junction of the White and Green rivers, Uintah County.
The northernmost specimens available to Durrant (1952:328) were
from one mile east of Greenriver, Grand County. These specimens
from Uintah County extend the known range 80 miles to the north,
and substantiate Durrant's conclusion that this subspecies occurs
east of the Green and Colorado rivers.</p>

<p><i><b>Clethrionomys gapperi uintaensis</b></i> Doutt. Red-backed Mouse.&mdash;Previously,
the red-backed mouse in Utah was known only from the
Uinta and Wasatch mountains. The southernmost localities from
which specimens were available were in northern Wasatch County
and southern Salt Lake County. Durrant (1952:355) supposed that
the species ranged southward to Mount Timpanogos in Utah
County. One specimen, No. 10,075, from the summit, 18 miles
east of Mayfield, Sanpete County, and 4 from Ephraim Canyon,
15 miles east of Ephraim, Sanpete County, show that this subspecies
occurs also on the Wasatch Plateau of central Utah. These latter
specimens extend the known range of the red-backed mouse in
Utah approximately 100 miles southward. Owing to the practically
continuous nature of the central mountain ranges of Utah,
students of mammals of Utah usually suspect that most montane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
mammals occur throughout these mountain ranges. The red-backed
mouse has been sought for in vain in the mountains south of the
Wasatch Plateau. Suitable habitats for this mouse occur throughout
the Fishlake Mountains, Thousand Lake Mountains and the
Aquarius Plateau, but despite intensive collecting, none has been
obtained from these areas.</p>

<p><i><b>Phenacomys intermedius intermedius</b></i> Merriam. Heather Vole.&mdash;The
heather vole, while not rare, is uncommon in Utah. Durrant
(1952:360) had but eight specimens from various localities in Summit,
Wasatch, Salt Lake and Utah counties and supposed that the
species was restricted to the western Uinta Mountains and southern
Wasatch Mountains. In the summers of 1952 and 1953, intensive
collecting of mammals was carried out on Boulder Mountain and the
Aquarius Plateau, in Wayne and Garfield counties. Two specimens,
nos. 8956 and 9074, were obtained from Spectacle Lake, Boulder
Mountain, Garfield County. These specimens extend the known area
of occurrence 175 miles southward in Utah. No specimens are known
from the areas between Mount Timpanogos in Utah County, and
Boulder Mountain in Garfield County. We suspect, however, that
when this intervening area has been thoroughly studied, the heather
vole, like many other montane mammals, will be found throughout
the entire length of the central mountain ranges.</p>

<p><i><b>Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus</b></i> (Baird). Pennsylvanian
Meadow Mouse.&mdash;In Utah this mouse was known only from wet
meadows in valleys immediately west of the Wasatch Mountains,
as far south as a place 2 miles south of Provo (Hall and Cockrum,
1953:410). Norman V. Chamberlain collected several specimens
"near" Koosharem Reservoir, Sevier County. These extend the
known range of this subspecies 110 miles southward, and suggest
that Pennsylvanian meadow mice occur, in suitable habitat, all
along the eastern margin of the Great Basin in Utah, at least as
far south as Sevier County. All northern specimens are from the
drainages of Utah Lake and Great Salt Lake, but these specimens
from Sevier County are from the Sevier River Drainage. This
species requires a fairly moist environment, and such habitat exists
between the aforementioned drainages which are practically interconnected
by Mona Reservoir and its adjacent areas of springs.</p>

<p><i><b>Zapus princeps utahensis</b></i> Hall. Big Jumping Mouse.&mdash;Durrant
(1952:388) reported a specimen from Puffer Lake, Beaver Mountains,
Beaver County. He supposed that this mouse occurred also
at high elevations still farther south in Utah. Subsequently, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
specimens were obtained from Garfield County; No. 9006 from
Steep Creek, 12 miles north of Boulder and No. 9071 from East
Fork of Boulder Creek, 10 miles north of Boulder. These two specimens
extend the known range of jumping mice in Utah 75 miles
southeastward. Several specimens have been obtained also from
the Fishlake Plateau, and further bear out Durrant's supposition that
these mammals occur on all of the high mountains of central Utah,
at least as far south as the Aquarius Plateau.</p>

<p><i><b>Urocyon cinereoargenteus scottii</b></i> Mearns. Gray Fox.&mdash;One skull,
No. 10,240, from mouth of Birch Creek, Deep Creek Mountains,
Juab County, extends the known geographic range 50 miles east
from Cherry Creek Canyon, Nevada (see Hall, 1946:241). This
record indicates that the species occurs in the mountainous areas
on the western margins of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, and extends
the known range in Utah approximately 150 miles northward. Furthermore,
this record proves that the gray fox occurs as far north
in western Utah as it does in eastern Nevada, but to date none has
been obtained from the mountains within the basin of the ancient
lake, even though some of them are not far removed from the
Deep Creek Mountains.</p>

<p><i><b>Lutra canadensis nexa</b></i> Goldman. River Otter.&mdash;River otters are
rare in a semi-arid state like Utah, and few have been preserved as
scientific specimens. Durrant (1952:436) had access to but one
skull from an immature animal from the Raft River Mountain area
in northwestern Boxelder County. At present there are two complete
specimens (skins, skulls and skeletons) in the collection of
the University of Utah. They were trapped by an employee of the
Utah State Fish and Game Department, and were donated to the
University of Utah by J. Perry Egan, Director of the above mentioned
department. They are nos. 8854 and 8855, and are from
the Raft River, 2 miles south of the Utah-Idaho border, Boxelder
County.</p>

<p><i><b>Alces americanus shirasi</b></i> Nelson. Moose.&mdash;The moose is rare in
Utah, and to date records of its occurrence have been based solely
upon sight records. There are, nevertheless, two specimens preserved.
One is a young bull (skull only) from Farmington Canyon,
Davis County, in the collection of Weber College, Ogden, Utah.
The other is one antler (No. 10,745) of a young bull from Henrys
Fork, 16 miles south of the Utah-Wyoming border, Summit County,
and it is in the collection of the University of Utah. This large cervid
apparently is increasing in numbers in the state. Dale Jones of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Utah State Fish and Game Department reported to us that a herd
of 25 animals was observed in 1954, in the vicinity of Haydens
Peak, Bear River Drainage, Summit County. A cow and a calf
were seen in the vicinity of Strawberry Reservoir, Wasatch County,
in 1951, by employees of the same department. This latter locality
is the most southern and eastern point of their known occurrence in
Utah.</p>

<p><i><b>Ovis canadensis canadensis</b></i> Shaw. Mountain Sheep.&mdash;Formerly,
the mountain sheep was not known to occur in the La Sal Mountains
in Grand and San Juan counties. On October 23, 1954, a two
year old ram, No. 10,906, was killed by a deer hunter at a locality
1-1/2 miles north of La Sal, La Sal Mountains, San Juan County. This
constitutes the first complete specimen (skin and skull) of a mountain
sheep from Utah. According to Harold Crane, of the Utah
State Fish and Game Department, this ram was running with a herd
of mule deer, and was the only mountain sheep that was seen. The
ram was confiscated and given to the Department of Zoology, University
of Utah, for preservation as a scientific specimen.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
