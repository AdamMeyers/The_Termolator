<p>There appears to be, from year to year, a growing popular taste for
quaint and curious reminiscences of "Ye Olden Time," and to meet this,
Mr. Henry M. Brooks has prepared a series of interesting handbooks. The
materials have been gleaned chiefly from old newspapers of Boston and
Salem, sources not easily accessible, and while not professing to be
history, the volumes contain much material for history, so combined and
presented as to be both amusing and instructive. The titles of some of
the volumes indicate their scope and their promise of entertainment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It has been the good fortune of the writer to be allowed a peep at the
manuscript for this series, and he can assure the lovers of the
historical and the quaint in literature that something both valuable and
pleasant is in store for them. In the specialties treated of in these
books Mr. Brooks has been for many years a careful collector and
student, and it is gratifying to learn that the material is to be
committed to book form."&mdash;<i>Salem Gazette.</i></p>

<p><i>"To say that the past is of no importance, unworthy of a moment's
regard, because it has gone by, and is no longer anything, is an
argument that cannot be held to any purpose; for if the past has ceased
to be, and is therefore to be accounted nothing in the scale of good or
evil, the future is yet to come, and has never been
anything."</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hazlitt</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DAYS_OF_THE_SPINNING-WHEEL" id="THE_DAYS_OF_THE_SPINNING-WHEEL"></a>THE DAYS OF THE SPINNING-WHEEL</h2>

<h3>IN NEW ENGLAND.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> the last few years many young ladies have searched country houses
or ransacked old garrets to find spinning-wheels, which, like old
chairs, tall clocks, and warming-pans, have now become objects of
curiosity and interest to those who take a fancy to antique articles. It
has become fashionable to have these things to adorn our Queen Anne
houses. And brass andirons and shovels and tongs have come into request,
so that we may enjoy the luxury of an open wood fire, which, to our
mind, is one of the most cheerful things in this world. Some one has
remarked "that to be well-dressed gives a feeling of satisfaction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> that
religion fails to give;" but to us, to sit before a blazing wood fire on
a dull, cold evening, gives a feeling of comfort and delight which
surpasses anything we know of. What charming companionship in a wood
fire! Better than the company of uncongenial persons.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Old wood to burn,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Old books to read:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>these are enough; we will leave out the "old wine to drink."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"This bright wood fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So like to that which warmed and lit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My youthful days, how doth it flit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Back on the periods nigher!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Re-lighting and re-warming with its glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bright scenes of my youth,&mdash;all gone out now."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Glance backward to some years before the Revolution, and we shall find a
spinning-wheel in every house, and then, probably, in constant use. Now
its place in our homes is taken by the piano. This instrument had not
then come into use. Something resembling it,&mdash;namely, the spinnet or the
harpsichord,&mdash;was to be found in some instances; but it was by no means
common to find these, for there was but little knowledge of music in
America in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> those days. A hundred years ago, only one or two churches in
Boston had organs, and the public taste, except in rare cases, was
decidedly against music of all kinds, especially sacred music. To show
how this was, we have heard an old lady say that when she was young,
some eighty years or so ago, "musicians, for the most part, were not
thought much of" by the most cultivated people of that time; and she
assured me that even at a later date, members of military bands, as well
as organists and violinists (then called fiddlers) were too often low
characters and men much addicted to drinking. The times were too hard
for the New England people of those days to cultivate music or indulge
in entertainments of any kind except "going to meeting." There was but
little money in circulation, and that was almost always in the form of a
depreciated currency. Gold and silver were scarce articles, and a large
proportion of the necessities of life and luxuries&mdash;if luxuries they
could be called; they would hardly be so considered by us&mdash;were imported
from England or elsewhere. The leading occupations were farming,
fishing, making New England<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> rum, importing rum, sugar, and molasses
from the West Indies, and dry goods from England. The common people were
poor enough, in comparison with the condition of the same class at the
present time, when they make as good an appearance as the wealthy did a
hundred years ago. It would be safe to say that they have more comforts
and conveniences in their homes to-day than the more prosperous had at
the time of the Revolution. The humorist, John Phenix, said that "Gen'l
Washington never saw a steamboat, nor rode in a railroad car;" and
possibly his house was not heated by steam, or furnished with pipes for
hot and cold water. Nor did he ever use gas, or the telegraph or
telephone. Whether the people who lived then would have shown the
extravagance which characterizes our time if they had possessed the
means, is a question not easily to be answered; but it is certain they
were more frugal than we are, if not more industrious. The Revolution
left the masses of the people in rather a destitute condition, and they
were forced to be economical. Their habits were so entirely different
from modern habits that it would exceed our limits to undertake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> to draw
a careful comparison. It is said that the people of those days bewailed
the degeneracy of the times, and spoke of the industry and frugality of
earlier periods.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='right'>NORWICH, May 6, 1784.</p>

<p>A corre&#383;pondent ob&#383;erves, that the extravagances of the
pre&#383;ent day are fully demon&#383;trated in the broadcloth
coats and &#383;ilk gowns,&mdash;the powder and feathers, the
ruffles and cardinals, the &#383;ilk &#383;tockings and feet
trappings&mdash;In the fea&#383;ts, the dancing parties and &#383;elect
companies&mdash;and what is the more melancholy, all orders and
degrees help form the circle.&mdash;Where is the &#383;implicity in
dre&#383;s and manners; temperance in meats and drinks, which
formed the virtuous characters of our illu&#383;trious
ance&#383;tors?&mdash;O! the degeneracy of the times!</p>

<p class='right'><i>Salem Gazette.</i></p></div>

<p>Just as our ancestors did, as Macaulay says, in the days of Charles the
First; they thought they were not as good as their ancestors had been.
This habit of looking back to a time so remote that "distance lends
enchantment to the view," seems to be almost universal. It is this
feeling of reverence for the old that makes it so interesting to us, and
leads us to look at things of the past poetically rather than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
practically; although it is true that sometimes the interest taken in
inconvenient and uncomfortable articles arises rather from their age
than from anything else. But oftentimes the very simplicity, solidity,
and strength of old furniture, for instance, is charming, in contrast
with the elaborate, unmeaning carvings and flimsy character of more
modern productions. We are beginning to see how much more sensible the
Chippendale and other styles commended by Eastlake and some other
writers on household art are to much that has been produced in later
times. Yet we must allow that prejudice and fashion go a great way in
determining our likes and dislikes, in furniture as well as in dress and
other things. Very likely in a few years we shall tire of the Queen Anne
houses and furniture, and hard floors, and have a surfeit of
<i>Anglomania</i>, especially if we carry the taste too far. In this country,
as Emerson says, "Every rider drives too fast." It is hard to be simple
and slow. We must build fast, eat fast, and live fast. But Emerson says
again, "Nature has no respect for haste." Herbert Spencer has given us
in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> kindly spirit some hints on this score which it would be well to
heed. But we are wandering from our immediate subject. Our desire is to
illustrate, in the very words of the people of the period we refer to,
the views they entertained of economy and industry, and how they carried
them out. We will begin, then, in the year 1759, with a curious letter
to the "Boston Gazette" of June 11 of that year, in which the writer
gives some account of the cost of provisions at that period.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><i>To the Trading and Farming People of</i> New England.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen.</span></p>

<p>I Have been coming and going among you &#383;ince the Year
1745. I am now once more on Service in this Part of the
World, and not a little &#383;urprized at the Alteration in the
Value of your Provi&#383;ions, &#383;ince my Knowledge of your
Country. When I fir&#383;t came among you, I could have bought
a Pound of Beef for a Penny, a Goo&#383;e for a Shilling, a
Fowl for three Pence, and &#383;o in Proportion. It now is, I
think, four Pence Sterling for a Pound of Beef, eighteen
Pence Sterling for a Fowl, and three Shillings for a
Goo&#383;e. Pray Gentlemen, when that is the Price at
<i>Bo&#383;ton</i>, what mu&#383;t we pay for it at <i>Louisbourg</i>, after
it has gone thro' the Hands of many different People that
are to live out of it. Our Pay is not increa&#383;ed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>I would &#383;ay nothing to influence you to &#383;ell cheaper,
from Motives di&#383;intere&#383;ted or publick &#383;pirited, as
that weighs but little with the Generality of Mankind. But
con&#383;ider your own Intere&#383;t, the War can la&#383;t but
little longer: This Campaign, in all Probability, will put
an End to it, then where will you find a Market for your
Stock you rai&#383;e. Con&#383;ider with the Fall of this
pre&#383;ent Summer, its pretty certain the Soldiers and Seamen
at pre&#383;ent employed for your Defence, will be called to
Britain: Take the Market while it holds Gentlemen. We have
Beef found us, that is to &#383;ay, the Publick purcha&#383;es it;
let us now and then ta&#383;te of your Veal, Mutton and Fowls
for our Money, and we will &#383;pend all among you; and we
expect both Intere&#383;t and Inclination will prompt you to
give us an ample Supply.</p>

the country in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> parts of New England, where, even if the "Lyons"
once seen at Cape Ann by Wood had departed, there were still some bears,
one having been seen within two miles of Boston.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We hear from Brentwood, in New Hamp&#383;hire Government, as

<p>When we remember the present condition of the city of Lynn, it is
interesting to note how that place stood in reference to the shoe
industry in the year 1762. The "Boston Gazette" of November 2 says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The statement has often been made by connoisseurs that there was no
mahogany furniture in America before the Revolution; but this is a
mistake, for here, in the "Boston Gazette" of Feb. 5, 1759, is an

Book-Case." Probably this was an early specimen of such kind of work, as
mahogany, it is said, was not introduced into Europe long before this

<p>In the year 1762 there appears to have been quite a stir in reference to
economy and home productions, and doubtless the spinning-wheels were
constantly in use. In the "Boston Gazette," November 2, is a very
curious letter of Henry Flynt, a noted teacher, addressed to the ladies
of North America.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><i>To the</i> LADIES <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">North America</span>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Ladies,</span></p>

them had been more particularly devoted to your Service.
This would have agreeably prevented me in an attempt to
which I find my&#383;elf in all Re&#383;pects but too unequal. Yet
relying on your good Sen&#383;e and Candour, I venture to lay
at your Feet a few well-intended Sentiments, which tho' in a
plain home&#383;pun Garb, I hope will not offend. I am
convinced that at this pre&#383;ent it is not only in your
Inclination and Will, but al&#383;o in your Power, to effect
more in favour of your Country, than an Army of an Hundred
Thou&#383;and Men; and indeed more than all the armed Men on
this va&#383;t Continent.</i>&mdash;Can a Woman forget her Ornaments?
<i>Yes I know &#383;he can.</i> Deborah <i>once judged I&#383;rael, and
&#383;ome think it was never judged much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> better afterwards.
But what tho't</i> Deborah <i>or</i> Jael <i>of their Ornaments, when
the one was contriving, &amp; the other driving the Nail that
would go? What tho't beautiful</i> E&#383;ther <i>of her Ornaments,
when tho&#383;e of her Kindred &amp; Hou&#383;hold were in immediate
and imminent Danger, by the Decree treacherou&#383;ly obtained
by</i> Haman, <i>from the mouth of her beloved and almo&#383;t

me, were I to recount the wondrous Deeds and mighty
Atchievements of renowned and honorable Women in all Ages.</i></p>

<p><i>I have but alluded to a few In&#383;tances, among many of

<p>Newport, R.I., has the reputation of having been engaged in the
slave-trade before the Revolution; and the following item, in the
"Boston Gazette," June 30, 1762, noticing without comment the arrival of
a Guinea trader there, would seem to show it to have been not an
uncommon occurrence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We hear from Newport, Rhode I&#383;land, That Capt. Carpenter
was arrived there from the Coa&#383;t of Guinea, having had 104

<p>On the 5th of November "the gunpowder treason and plot" was formerly
pretty generally remembered,&mdash;by the boys, at least, who made bonfires
and burned tar-barrels. We believe the custom has fallen into disuse
except in Salem and Marblehead, where there seems to be a little
"Colonialism" left. As recently as 1885 the writer saw a bonfire in
honor of the occasion on a hill near the latter place. In 1762 there
must have been quite a demonstration, if we can judge anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> by a
vote of the town of Boston. Englishmen visiting us have sometimes
expressed astonishment at learning that this curious custom should still
be kept up here, while it had been abolished at home.</p>

<p>The accommodation offered for travel between Boston and New York before
the Revolution must have been slim enough, judging from an advertisement
in the "Boston<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> Gazette" in 1761. Passengers then went by vessel from
Providence; that is, "Gentlemen Passengers." Whether ladies were
accommodated or not, does not appear; but perhaps they were in the habit
of going by stage, taking a week or so to accomplish the journey, or,
more than likely, few ever travelled at all in those times. In our day,
when every one is on the move, it is hard to realize this state of
things.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Notice is Given, That SAMUEL and WILLIAM CHACE, of</i>

<p>"In 1756," Watson says, "the first stage was started between
Philadelphia and New York by Mr. Butler; three days through in summer
time, five and six in winter. In 1765 a second stage was started, to go
through positively in three days. This was a covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> Jersey

<p>A brief account of Montreal in the "Boston Gazette," March 30, 1761.</p>

<p class='center'>Extract of a Letter from Montreal.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;"The Ca&#383;e of the poor Canadians is really deplorable,
occa&#383;ioned by the bankruptcy of the crown of France. Many
of them who had, with great danger and labour, acquired
e&#383;tates worth 20,000&nbsp;l. &#383;terl. by the fur-trade, or
otherwi&#383;e, can now &#383;carce procure a dinner. All their
remittances from their mother country, con&#383;i&#383;ted in
bills on the French King, which are not now worth one
farthing, as no body whatever will accept of them in
payment. It is computed there is above the value of
3,000,000&nbsp;l. &#383;terling of the&#383;e u&#383;ele&#383;s paper
&#383;craps, circulated through the colony, which, as a reward
to the wretched inhabitants for all their hard&#383;hips and
fatigues, mu&#383;t now &#383;upply the place of affluence and
independence. Mo&#383;t, if not all of them, are perfectly
reconciled to the Briti&#383;h government, as they can now with
&#383;ecurity enjoy any little property they have; whereas
formerly, Governor Vaudreuil made no ceremony of &#383;eizing
the produce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> of their lands, their merchandize and
manufactures of every kind, and after conveying them to the
King's &#383;tore hou&#383;es, paid to the proprietors any price
he plea&#383;ed. If the owners thereafter had occa&#383;ion for
any of their own commodities, they could not procure them
under twenty times the price they had received.</p>

<p>"Montreal in general is a well built town, but incapable of
any defence. The churches are elegant, and the hou&#383;es of
&#383;ome of their principal men are really magnificent; though
few in number. The Hotel Dieu is by far the fine&#383;t
ho&#383;pital I ever &#383;aw, every thing in it is extremely neat
and convenient.</p>

<p>"The people here are extravagantly fond of dre&#383;s; a
&#383;tranger would take Montreal to be a city inhabited by
none but the rich and idle: they are all finely powdered,
walk with their hats under their arms, and wear long coats,
adorned with tin&#383;el lace, and buttoned down to the
extremity. Since I came here, I have not &#383;een one man
dre&#383;&#383;ed like a trade&#383;man. The ladies in general are
hand&#383;ome, extremely gay, and well bred."</p></div>

<p>In 1767 the best soap and "dipt" and "mould" candles were sold at the
post-office in Boston, according to an advertisement in the "Gazette" of
October 26. The candles were made of tallow, and gave but little light,
requiring almost constant snuffing. Other kinds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> candles were not in
general use in New England in the last century. Sperm oil and sperm or
wax candles could be used only by the wealthy. Many families, for
economy, made their own candles. This practice was common in New England
down to within fifty years.</p>

<p>It will be recollected that Dr. Franklin's father was a tallow-chandler
in Boston, and that the Doctor himself worked at the business when a
boy. Elizabeth Franklin, whose name appears in the following
advertisement, was probably a relative of the family.</p>

Country Dances began about nine, and about ten a Supper Room
was opened, where was a very hand&#383;ome Collation. The
Ladies made a brilliant Appearance, and the Company

<p>The great military "occasion" of those days was the annual parade of the

<p><span class="smcap">Boston in Olden Times</span>.&mdash;The "Boston Transcript," in a notice of the
newspapers published in Boston in 1767, of which there were ten, says:
The printer in those days was a man of "all work." If a negro or horse
was up for sale, the printer was the seller. The advertisements in these
old papers are curiosities in their line. The following notices appeared
in the advertising columns of the "Boston Evening Gazette," in 1741:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To be sold by the Printer of this Paper, the very best
negro woman in this town, who has had the small pox and the
measles; is as hearty as a horse, as brisk as a bird, and
will work like a beaver."</p>

<p>"To be sold by the Printer of this Paper, a negro man about
thirty years old, who can do both town and country business
very well, but will suit the country best, where they have
not so many dram-shops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> as we have in Boston. He has worked
at the printing business fifteen or sixteen years; can
handle axe, saw, spade, hoe, or other instrument of
husbandry, as well as most men, and values himself, and is
valued by others, for his skill in cookery."</p></div>

<p>This item, from a paper of 1767, seems to show that the Government was
not then obliged to have a "bill" to uphold silver, for it was evidently

rather, it had not been discovered.</p>

<p>The "Virginia Gazette" gives an account of an early and bold attempt at
British impressment of seamen. This business caused us a great deal of
trouble in after years, and was one of the causes of "Madison's War," as
the old people were fond of calling it.</p>

<p>The press-gang was one of the peculiar institutions of Great Britain.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='right'>BOSTON, October 26, 1767.</p>

<p>By the Virginia Gazette, of the fir&#383;t In&#383;tant, it
appears that Captain Morgan, of the Hornet Sloop of War,
concerted a bloody riotous Plan, to impre&#383;s Seamen, at
Norfolk, for which Purpo&#383;e, his Tender was equipped with
Guns and Men, and under Cover of the Night &#383;aid Morgan
landed at a public Wharff, having fir&#383;t made proper
Di&#383;po&#383;itions either for an Attack or Retreat, then went
to a Tavern, and took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> a chearful Gla&#383;s, after which they
went to work, and took every Per&#383;on they met with, and
knocked all down that re&#383;i&#383;ted; and dragged them on
board the Tender; but the Town &#383;oon took the Alarm, and
being headed by Paul Loyal, E&#383;q; a Magi&#383;trate, they
endeavoured to convince Capt. Morgan of his Error, and being
deaf to all they &#383;aid he ordered the People in the Tender
to fire on the Inhabitants, but they refu&#383;ed to obey their
Commanders Orders, and he was &#383;oon obliged to fly, leaving
&#383;ome of the Hornets behind, who were &#383;ent to Gaol, but
were afterwards relea&#383;ed.</p></div>

<p>Mr. John Ashton, in his recently published work on "Social Life in
England at the end of the Eighteenth Century," informs us that one
evening in the year 1790, 2,100 men were pressed in London alone,
besides many more at the seaport towns.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1762 there was a severe drought in Massachusetts, and
the Governor issued a proclamation recommending public prayers for rain;
but it will be noticed that he says if rain should come before the day
set apart for prayers, then, instead of humiliation, it would be the
duty of the people to make it a day of thanksgiving. The proclamation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>

<p>Timothy Pickering, the father of the distinguished Revolutionary officer
and statesman of the same name, addressed an open letter to King George
III., which is printed in the "Salem Gazette," Oct. 31, 1769. It is a
very quaint production, but it shows the writer's love of simplicity and
downright honesty. He was a sturdy Puritan.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='right'>"Oct. 31, 1769.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">To the King of Great Britain.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Great Sir</span>,&mdash;Your Kingdom is like a Hou&#383;e divided
again&#383;t it&#383;elf. Something Extraordinary mu&#383;t be done.
Our Parliaments for fifty years pa&#383;t (or &#383;ome of them)
have ruined the Nation, in making a mon&#383;trous Debt by
hiring Money, while greater Sums have been expended in Pride
and Luxury. Thirteen hundred Thou&#383;and Pounds Sterling, the
Public Prints tell us, is paid annually to the Dutch as
Intere&#383;t money. My Advice is that all Rulers and
Officers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> who have high Salaries, drop them, except &#383;o
much as is nece&#383;&#383;ary for plain Living;&mdash;(Samuel had more
Honour in his plain Living with his upright Mind, than Saul
had in all his Princely Grandeur,)&mdash;And that all
unnece&#383;&#383;ary Pen&#383;ions cea&#383;e together with military
Officers half-pay, (How Unequal are our Ways: The&#383;e
Officers mu&#383;t have large Half-Pay, while the common
Soldiers are not allowed &#383;mall Half-Pay&mdash;who have been
expo&#383;ed generally to greater Hardships than their
Officers. Either let all have Half-Pay or none. The Soldiers
are to be re&#383;pected as well as their Officers and are as
nece&#383;&#383;ary,) and that high Taxes <i>very high</i> be laid on all
Pride and Luxury, wherever it is found, the Clergy and the
Women not excepted; And that great Taxes be laid on the
Rich. I have an Income of but about eighty Pounds Sterling a
Year, including my own Hands Labour, neverthele&#383;s I am
freely willing to pay one quarter Part of it in Taxes till
my Public Debts are paid. Others that have Two hundred a
Year, can with Ea&#383;e pay one half of it in Taxes, if need
be. <i>Pay thy Debts</i>; Owe no man anything is Law, <i>Divine and
Moral</i>. Immoral Men are in the road that leads to Hell; if
they attend Public Wor&#383;hip, they are Hypocrites, like the
Scribes and Phari&#383;ees, of whom <i>Chri&#383;t</i> &#383;aid, Ye are
of your Father the Devil. If I under&#383;tand the Apo&#383;tle,
when such Men &#383;it or kneel at a Communion Table, it is a
Table of Devils to them. Pray, Sir, tell your Placemen that
the va&#383;t Multitude of your Subjects are very unea&#383;y that
&#383;o<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> much of the Public Money, when rai&#383;ed is &#383;unk in
the Gulph of Exhorbitancy. My Governor, Mr. Francis Bernard,
demands a thou&#383;and Pounds Sterling a Year; one half that
Sum is more than Enough, e&#383;pecially as the Nation is ready
to &#383;ink with the Weight of its Public Debt. The <i>Clergy</i>
can tell their Congregations that the New Te&#383;tament rather
reproves than commands the wearing of co&#383;tly Array and
faring &#383;umptuou&#383;ly every Day; And I may venture to tell
my Readers that all tho&#383;e who neglect taking a
con&#383;cientious care to pay their Debts, private Debts, as
well as public, are in the high Way to De&#383;truction; the
commonne&#383;s of the Sin don't abate the Malignity of it.</p>

<p>P.S. Your Maje&#383;ty &#383;ees how diligent Governor Nehemiah
was in reforming what was ami&#383;s in I&#383;rael. He was
obliged indeed to contend with the Nobles and the Rulers who
oppo&#383;ed him, but he &#383;ubdued them, and no wonder!
Becau&#383;e he feared God and not Man.</p>

his Kingdom.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickering wrote a letter to his son, while the latter was a student
at Harvard College, requesting him not to play at cards, a practice
which he regarded as wicked. But the son (Colonel Timothy Pickering
afterwards), as Mr. Upham, his biographer, well remarks, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> altogether
too busy with his studies to waste time over cards.</p>

<p>We do not observe in the old papers much that would indicate a belief in
modern Spiritualism; but it would seem from some accounts that "angels"
were occasionally seen. In the cases we quote, the kind of "angels" is
not stated. Whether they were real live beauties, or not, can only be
conjectured. Who would not now like to buy one of these books at "four
Coppers," so as to read all about these angels?</p>

<p><i>On Friday la&#383;t, in the Afternoon, was the Dedication of
the new Synagogue, in this Town. It began by a hand&#383;ome
Proce&#383;&#383;ion, in which were carried the Books of the Law, to
be depo&#383;ited in the Ark. Several Portions of Scripture,
and of their Service, with a Prayer for the Royal Family,
were read, and finely &#383;ung by the Prie&#383;t and People.
There were pre&#383;ent many Gentlemen and Ladies. The Order

together with a hand&#383;ome A&#383;&#383;embly of People, in an

<p>We find by the "Salem Mercury" of March 30, 1789, that New Hackensack
was fifty or sixty years before Rochester in "rappings" and
"table-tippings." Who shall say that these manifestations, whatever they
are, are not as old as man himself? The best and wisest of us do not
know everything. There may be some science, yet in its infancy, which
will some day be explained, so that all these things will then be
perfectly understood. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> account here given has no appearance of
deception. Had the girl lived a hundred years earlier, she would in all
probability have been hanged for a witch; but had she lived in these
days, she might have reaped a harvest from lectures and s&eacute;ances.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Extract of a letter from a gentleman at Fi&#383;hkill, dated
March 3, 1789.</i></p>

<p>"Were I to relate the many extraordinary accounts of the
unfortunate girl at New-Hacken&#383;ack, your belief might,
perhaps, be &#383;taggered. I &#383;hall therefore only inform you
of what I was an eyewitne&#383;s to. La&#383;t Sunday afternoon
my&#383;elf and wife went to Dr. Thorn's, and after &#383;itting
&#383;ometime, we heard a knocking under the feet of a young
woman that lives in the family; I a&#383;ked the Doctor what
occa&#383;ioned the noi&#383;e&mdash;he could not tell, but replied,
that he, together with &#383;everal others had examined the
hou&#383;e, but were unable to di&#383;cover the cau&#383;e. I then
took a candle, and went with the girl into the cellar&mdash;there
the knocking al&#383;o continued; but as we were a&#383;cending
the &#383;tairs to return, I heard a prodigious rapping on each
&#383;ide, which alarmed me very much. I &#383;tood &#383;till &#383;ome
time looking around with amazement, when I beheld &#383;ome
lumber, which lay at the head of the &#383;tairs, &#383;hake
con&#383;iderably. About eight or ten days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> after, we vi&#383;ited
the girl again&mdash;the knocking &#383;till continued, though much
louder. Our curio&#383;ity induced us to pay the third vi&#383;it,
when the phenomena were &#383;till more alarming. I then &#383;aw
the chairs move; a large dining table was thrown again&#383;t
me, and a &#383;mall &#383;tand on which &#383;tood a candle, was
to&#383;&#383;ed up, and thrown in my wife's lap; after which we
left the hou&#383;e, much &#383;urpri&#383;ed at what we had &#383;een."</p></div>

<p>Within the writer's recollection, in nearly every house in Salem two or
more fire-buckets, marked with the owner's name, were, when not in use,
kept hanging in the front hall. At fires, lanes, as they were called, of
men were formed, under the direction generally of the fire-wards, and
water was passed from one to another and to the fire from some
neighboring pump or cistern.</p>

<p>With regard to policies, the term "under-writer" came from an old
custom. There were in old times no joint-stock companies for insurance,
but policies were filled out and left at an office kept by some person
for the purpose, where any responsible man could sign his name to a
particular policy and affix such sum as he was willing to risk, and thus
become one of the "underwriters." We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> have seen, for instance, a policy
for $20,000 with twelve or fifteen names of merchants, signed with
various sums from $500 upwards.</p>

<p>For &#383;ome days bye-pa&#383;t, there have been &#383;everal
affrays between the inhabitants and the &#383;oldiers quartered
in this town.</p>

<p>La&#383;t Monday about 9 o'clock at night a mo&#383;t unfortunate

people, called to the main-guard, upon which Capt.

<p>We do not see much in the papers about spinning-wheels until after the
War of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> Revolution; then there seemed to be what may be called a
revival of domestic industry. In 1786 the ladies of Hartford, Conn.,
formed an Economical Association. They say that they are "fully sensible
that our calamities are in a great measure occasioned by the luxury and
extravagance of individuals, and are of opinion that it is a duty they
owe their country as well as their families to retrench as far as
possible all unnecessary expenses." Their articles of agreement were
signed, on the 6th of November, 1786, by more than a hundred ladies
belonging to the first families in the city. By these articles they
engage "not to purchase for next six months any Gauze, Ribbons, Lace,
Feathers, Beaver-Hats, Silks, Muslins, and Chintzes, except only for
weddings and mourning;" also to "dress their persons in the plainest
manner and encourage industry, frugality, and neatness, giving all due
preference to the manufactures of their own country." To this they add
that "when they receive visits and make entertainments, it will be their
study to avoid unnecessary expense, especially on foreign articles." On
June 17 of that year the President of Harvard College addressed a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
letter to the "Massachusetts Gazette" which is interesting in this
connection. This letter we copy to show how economy entered into
everything, even a "liberal education." It will moreover be of interest
because of the attempt made to regulate the students' dress.</p>

<p><i>To the Publi&#383;her of the Ma&#383;&#383;achu&#383;etts</i> Gazette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> proper attempt of the Governours of the Univer&#383;ity
to le&#383;&#383;en the expen&#383;e of a liberal education mu&#383;t be
grateful to the Publick, and meet with their hearty
concurrence; the Members of the Community, therefore, in
general, and the Parents and Guardians of the Students in
particular, it is not doubted, will be well plea&#383;ed with
&#383;ome late regulations, made by the Corporation and
Over&#383;eers, to introduce economy in dre&#383;s, and will
readily perform their part, in carrying them into effect.</p>

<p>By ordering an uniform, the Governours of the Society have
removed the temptation to that frequent change of apparel,
which may have ari&#383;en from the liberty the Students have
had, of chu&#383;ing different colours, from time to time: And
by entirely prohibiting &#383;ilk (an unnece&#383;&#383;ary article in
their clothing) a very con&#383;iderable expen&#383;e is
prevented.</p>

<p>That the dre&#383;s of the Students be neat and decent is
highly proper; but that it &#383;hould be very ornamental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> and
expen&#383;ive is ever needle&#383;s, and oftentimes pernicious:
Nor will any Student, who is &#383;olicitous to acquire
knowledge, and &#383;incerely di&#383;po&#383;ed to improve his time
to the be&#383;t advantage, in obtaining &#383;uch degrees of it,
as may enable him to be exten&#383;ively u&#383;eful to the
Community, feel a reluctance to economical in&#383;titutions
re&#383;pecting dre&#383;s. He will not only e&#383;teem the
ornaments of the mind of va&#383;tly higher importance than
tho&#383;e of the body, but the general good will al&#383;o
con&#383;tantly influence his conduct; and he will chearfully
encourage every regulation, which tends to promote
frugality.</p>

<p>The regulations referred to, I now tran&#383;mit to you, which
the Corporation and Over&#383;eers of the Univer&#383;ity
reque&#383;t you to publi&#383;h, for the information of all

<p>The habit of Snuff-taking was formerly very prevalent in New England, as
well as elsewhere. Within the writer's recollection it was a very common
thing to see the snuff-box passed round for friends to take a pinch.
Very few now a days indulge in this uncleanly habit; but a recent
traveller relates that on visiting St. Peter's in Rome, the first thing
upon entering the church which attracted his attention was seeing the
Pope take a pinch of snuff and then shake from his pocket a large
old-fashioned bandanna handkerchief, which he applied to his nose. Many
years ago a gentleman of Salem was questioned by a stranger about a
certain man who happened to be an inveterate snuff-taker and who was at
the same time greatly interested in free-masonry. "Yes," said the
gentleman, "I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> him."&mdash;"He's about one third masonry and two thirds
snuff." Mr. Francis H. Lee, of Salem, has a curious collection of a
hundred or more snuff-boxes of former generations. They are of various
patterns; some are made of shell and tipped with silver, and look quite
ancient. Simon Elliot, of Boston, and later Wm. Micklefield, of Salem,
were famous snuff manufacturers.</p>

ladies, belonging to this town, a&#383;&#383;lembled, at 2 o'clock,
P.M. at the hou&#383;e of Mr. Daniel Balkum, and, to the

indu&#383;try, &#383;pun, before &#383;un&#383;et, 199 &#383;keins of
excellent linen yarn. Indu&#383;try is the genuine &#383;ource of
all laudable plea&#383;ure. On it depend all the conveniences
of life. Health, the greate&#383;t of ble&#383;&#383;ings, depends on
indu&#383;try&mdash;beauty, on health. If ladies, then, wi&#383;h to be
beautiful, they mu&#383;t be indu&#383;trious; they mu&#383;t animate
their countenances with that blooming health which comes
from the <span class="smcap">Spinning-wheel</span>. The fair &#383;ex, when rightly and
indu&#383;triou&#383;ly employed, are ju&#383;tly termed the beauty
of this lower creation. Beauty without virtue is
contemptible. Merit only gains the heart. Idlene&#383;s is
di&#383;graceful. Indu&#383;try is the ornament of wealth, the
&#383;upport and con&#383;olation of poverty. We hope &#383;oon to
&#383;ee the time, when the fair daughters of America will be
clothed in the manufactures of their own hands. Happy are
we, that &#383;ome have already &#383;et the example. May it never
be &#383;aid, that American ladies ri&#383;e 15 minutes later than
the &#383;un. May they ever have thread enough in their hands
to make a halter for a Shays.</p></div>

crown the plea&#383;ure of the day, with additional company,
they regaled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> with an agreeable dance, and, at a mode&#383;t

<p>In Scotland, the farmers knit as well as the women of their
families; but they do this while they are watching their

emulous indu&#383;try was never more apparent than in this
beautiful a&#383;&#383;embly. The majority of fair hands gave motion
to not le&#383;s than &#383;ixty wheels. Many were occupied in

hundred and thirty-&#383;ix, &#383;even-knotted &#383;keins of
excellent cotton and linen yarn, the work of the day,
excepting about a dozen &#383;keins, which &#383;ome of the
company brought in ready &#383;pun. Some had &#383;pun &#383;ix and
many not le&#383;s than five &#383;keins apiece. She takes this
opportunity of returning thanks to each, which the hurry of
the day rendered impracticable at the time. To conclude and
crown the day, a numerous band of the be&#383;t &#383;ingers
attended in the evening and performed an agreeable variety
of excellent pieces in psalmody. "The price of a virtuous
woman is far above rubies, * * * She layeth her hands to the
&#383;pindle and her hands hold the di&#383;taff."</p>

<p>When spinning-wheels ceased to be used altogether, we are not able to
say. Probably they were not in use for any great length of time after
the opening of the present century; but possibly in some country places
they were used down to the time of the War of 1812, and even later. We
are informed that in some remote places in Rhode Island and in Maine
spinning-wheels are in use to this day; but these are exceptional cases.</p>

<p class='center'>MANUFACTORIES AND THE SPINNING WHEEL.</p>

<p>"The establishment of extensive manufactories, and the
introduction of power-looms and spinning-jennies, has nearly
destroyed the usual household manufactures, and put our
other Jennies out of employment. Our ears are seldom greeted
now a days in the farmer's cottage with the flying of the
shuttle, or the deep base of the spinning wheel. We confess
that we have looked upon their departure with a strong
feeling of regret; and deem it no small abatement of the
advantages, which the establishment of extensive
manufactures has obviously yielded to the country, that it
removes the daughter from the shelter and security of the
paternal roof, and places her in a situation, which
certainly furnishes no means of qualifying her for the
proper department of woman; to preside over our domestic
establishments; to perform her part in the joint labors of
the household; and to know how and when and where to use,
prepare, and to apply to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> the best advantage within doors,
the products of man's labor without doors. Many occupations
of female industry, strictly domestic however, of a healthy
and agreeable nature, are constantly presenting themselves,
so that there is little danger that the race of industrious
women, and accomplished wives, at least among the country
girls, will soon be extinct; and the silk culture, fast
gaining ground among us, promises to furnish an unexhausted
resource and a profitable employment of female labor."</p>

<p>In one of the numbers of the London "Spectator" for 1884 is an
interesting account of an attempt to revive the spinning-wheel industry
in England, through the kind offices of Mr. Albert Flemming, for the
purpose of helping poor women too old or blind to leave their homes for
other work. After considerable difficulty, a wheel was discovered among
a store of ancient articles; but no one at first knew how to use it.
Spinning was one of the lost arts, apparently. At length, however, an
old woman of eighty-four was found who understood the use of the wheel.
She taught Mr. Flemming how to spin. A few more old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> wheels were found,
and some new ones constructed. Then it was some time before a loom could
be discovered. Eventually this was accomplished, and the art of weaving
taught. The account says that twenty women who were unable otherwise to
obtain a living, are now busily at work, happy in being able to provide
for their families. They make, it may be added, a good strong, honest
linen, specimens of which have been presented to Mr. Ruskin. This
account is substantially from the "Living Age," Nov. 1, 1884.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
