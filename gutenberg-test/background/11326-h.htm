      SPIRIT OF "THE ANNUALS" FOR 1828.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our readers have annually anticipated a high treat from this
      splendid intellectual banquet, served up by some of the

      spirits of the age.
    </p>

      We doubt whether the comparison is refined enough for the
      fair authoresses; but our fancy has led us to class their
      contributions to the present feast as follow:&mdash;

      The original engraving is by Edward Goodall, from a painting
      by William Linton, Esq. It is altogether a rich and glorious
      composition, at this moment too, glowing with more than
      pictorial interest; and the <i>carmen triumphale</i> of the
      poetess is a worthy accompaniment. Among the other engravings
      the frontispiece and opposite page of this work are extremely
      rich and beautiful: <i>Psyche borne by the Zephyrs to the
      Island of Pleasure</i>, is full of languishing beauty;
      <i>Medora</i>, painted by Pickersgill and engraved by Rolls,
      is a delightfully placid moonlight scene; the
      <i>Declaration</i>, easy and graceful: there are, however, in
      our opinion, two decided failures in the volume, which, for
      the credit of the artists, had better been omitted. Our
      present notices of the <i>literary</i> department must be
      confined to the following selection:
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE CITY OF THE DEMONS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>By William Maginn, Esq.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In days of yore, there lived in the flourishing city of
      Cairo, a Hebrew Rabbi, by name Jochorian, who was the most
      learned of his nation. His fame went over the East, and the
      most distant people sent their young men to imbibe wisdom
      from his lips. He was deeply skilled in the traditions of the
      fathers, and his word on a disputed point was decisive. He
      was pious, just, temperate, and strict; but he had one
      vice&mdash;a love of gold had seized upon his heart, and he
      opened not his hand to the poor. Yet he was wealthy above
      most, his wisdom being to him the source of riches. The
      Hebrews of the city were grieved at this blemish on the
      wisest of their people; but though the elders of the tribes
      continued to reverence him for his fame, the women and
      children of Cairo called him by no other name than that of
      Rabbi Jochonan the miser.
    </p>
    <p>
      None knew, so well as he, the ceremonies necessary for
      initiation into the religion of Moses; and, consequently, the
      exercise of those solemn offices was to him another source of
      gain. One day, as he walked in the fields about Cairo,
      conversing with a youth on the interpretation of the law, it
      so happened, that the angel of death smote the young man
      suddenly, and he fell dead before the feet of the Rabbi, even
      while he was yet speaking. When the Rabbi found that the
      youth was dead, he rent his garments, and glorified the Lord.
      But his heart was touched, and the thoughts of death troubled
      him in the visions of the night. He felt uneasy when he
      reflected on his hardness to the poor, and he said, "Blessed
      be the name of the Lord! The first good thing that I am asked
      to do in that holy name, will I perform."&mdash;But he
      sighed, for he feared that some one might ask of him a
      portion of his gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      While yet he thought upon these things, there came a loud cry
      at his gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awake, thou sleeper!" said the voice; "Awake! A child is in
      danger of death, and the mother hath sent me for thee that
      thou may'st do thine office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The night is dark and gloomy," said the Rabbi, coming to his
      casement, "and mine age is great; are there not younger men
      than I in Cairo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For thee only, Rabbi Jochonan, whom some call the wise, but
      whom others call Rabbi Jochonan the miser, was I sent. Here
      is gold," said he, taking out a purse of sequins&mdash;"I
      want not thy labour for nothing. I adjure thee to come, in
      the name of the living God."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Rabbi thought upon the vow he had just made, and he
      groaned in spirit, for the purse sounded heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As thou hast adjured me by that name, I go with thee," said
      he to the man, "but I hope the distance is not far. Put up
      thy gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The place is at hand," said the stranger, who was a gallant
      youth, in magnificent attire. "Be speedy, for time presses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jochonan arose, dressed himself, and
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page411" name="page411"></a>[pg
      411]</span> accompanied the stranger, after having carefully
      locked up all the doors of his house, and deposited his keys
      in a secret place&mdash;at which the stranger smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never remember," said the Rabbi, "so dark a night. Be thou
      to me as a guide, for I can hardly see the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it well," replied the stranger with a sigh, "it is a
      way much frequented, and travelled hourly by many; lean upon
      mine arm and fear not."
    </p>
    <p>
      They journeyed on; and though the darkness was great, yet the
      Rabbi could see, when it occasionally brightened, that he was
      in a place strange to him. "I thought," said he, "I knew all
      the country for leagues about Cairo, yet I know not where I
      am. I hope, young man," said he to his companion, "that thou
      hast not missed the way;" and his heart misgave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear not," returned the stranger. "Your journey is even now
      done," and, as he spoke, the feet of the Rabbi slipped from
      under him, and he rolled down a great height. When he
      recovered, he found that his companion had fallen also, and
      stood by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, young man," said the Rabbi, "if thus thou sportest with
      the grey hairs of age, thy days are numbered. Wo unto him who
      insults the hoary head!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger made an excuse, and they journeyed on some
      little further in silence. The darkness grew less, and the
      astonished Rabbi, lifting up his eyes, found that they had
      come to the gates of a city which he had never before seen.
      Yet he knew all the cities of the land of Egypt, and he had
      walked but half an hour from his dwelling in Cairo. So he
      knew not what to think, but followed the man with trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon entered the gates of the city, which was lighted up
      as if there were a festival in every house. The streets were
      full of revellers, and nothing but a sound of joy could be
      heard. But when Jochonan looked upon their faces&mdash;they
      were the faces of men pained within; and he saw, by the marks
      they bore, that they were Mazikin [demons]. He was terrified
      in his soul; and, by the light of the torches, he looked also
      upon the face of his companion, and, behold! he saw upon him
      too, the mark that shewed him to be a Demon. The Rabbi feared
      excessively&mdash;almost to fainting; but he thought it
      better to be silent; and sadly he followed his guide, who
      brought him to a splendid house, in the most magnificent
      quarter of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enter here?" said the Demon to Jochonan, "for this house is
      mine. The lady and the child are in the upper chamber;" and,
      accordingly, the sorrowful Rabbi ascended the stair to find
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, whose dazzling beauty was shrouded by melancholy
      beyond hope, lay in bed; the child, in rich raiment,
      slumbered on the lap of the nurse, by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have brought to thee, light of my eyes!" said the Demon,
      "Rebecca, beloved of my soul! I have brought thee Rabbi
      Jochonan the wise, for whom thou didst desire. Let him, then,
      speedily begin his office; I shall fetch all things
      necessary, for he is in haste to depart."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled bitterly as he said these words, looking at the
      Rabbi; and left the room, followed by the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jochonan and the lady were alone, she turned in the bed
      towards him, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unhappy man that thou art! knowest thou where thou hast been
      brought?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," said he, with a heavy groan; I know that I am in a
      city of the Mazikin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know, then, further," said she, and the tears gushed from
      eyes brighter than the diamond, "know then, further, that no
      one is ever brought here, unless he hath sinned before the
      Lord. What my sin hath been imports not to thee&mdash;and I
      seek not to know thine. But here thou remainest for
      ever&mdash;lost, even as I am lost." And she wept again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rabbi dashed his turban on the ground, and tearing his
      hair, exclaimed, "Wo is me! Who art thou, woman! that
      speakest to me thus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a Hebrew woman," said she, "the daughter of a Doctor of
      the Laws in the city of Bagdad; and being brought hither, it
      matters not how, I am married to a prince among the Mazikin,
      even him who was sent for thee. And that child, whom thou
      sawest, is our first-born, and I could not bear the thought
      that the soul of our innocent babe should perish. I therefore
      besought my husband to try to bring hither a priest, that the
      law of Moses (blessed be his memory!) should be done; and thy
      fame, which has spread to Bagdad, and lands further towards
      the rising of the sun, made me think of thee. Now my husband,
      though great among the Mazikin, is more just than the other
      Demons; and he loves me, whom he hath ruined, with a love of
      despair. So he said, that the name of Jochonan the wise was
      familiar unto him, and that he knew thou wouldst not be able
      to refuse. What thou hast done, to give him power over thee,
      is known to thyself."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page412" name="page412"></a>[pg
      412]</span> "I swear, before Heaven!" said the Rabbi, "that I
      have ever diligently kept the law, and walked stedfastly
      according to the traditions of our fathers, from the day of
      my youth upward. I have wronged no man in word or deed, and I
      have daily worshipped the Lord; minutely performing all the
      ceremonies thereto needful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," said the lady, "all this thou mightest have done, and
      more, and yet be in the power of the Demons. But time passes,
      for I hear the foot of my husband mounting the stair. There
      is one chance of thine escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that? O lady of beauty?" said the agonized Rabbi.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eat not, drink not, nor take fee or reward while here; and
      as long as thou canst do thus, the Mazikin have no power over
      thee, dead or alive. Have courage, and persevere."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she ceased from speaking, her husband entered the room,
      followed by the nurse, who bore all things requisite for the
      ministration of the Rabbi. With a heavy heart he performed
      his duty, and the child was numbered among the faithful. But
      when, as usual, at the conclusion of the ceremony, the wine
      was handed round to be tasted by the child, the mother, and
      the Rabbi, he refused it when it came to him, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare me, my lord, for I have made a vow that I fast this
      day; and I will not eat, neither will I drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it as thou pleasest," said the Demon, "I will not that
      thou shouldst break thy vow;" and he laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the poor Rabbi was taken into a chamber, looking into a
      garden, where he passed the remainder of the night and the
      day weeping, and praying to the Lord that he would deliver
      him from the city of Demons. But when the twelfth hour came,
      and the sun was set, the Prince of the Mazikin came again
      unto him, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eat now, I pray thee, for the day of thy vow is past;" and
      he set meat before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon again thy servant, my lord," said Jochonan, "in this
      thing. I have another vow for this day also. I pray thee be
      not angry with thy servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not angry," said the Demon, "be it as thou pleasest; I
      respect thy vow;" and he laughed louder than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Rabbi sat another day in his chamber by the garden,
      weeping and praying. And when the sun had gone behind the
      hills, the Prince of the Mazikin again stood before him, and
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eat now, for thou must be an hungered. It was a sore vow of
      thine;" and he offered him daintier meats.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jochonan felt a strong desire to eat, but he prayed
      inwardly to the Lord, and the temptation passed, and he
      answered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse thy servant yet a third time, my lord, that I eat
      not. I have renewed my vow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so, then," said the other; "arise, and follow me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Demon took a torch in his hand, and led the Rabbi through
      winding passages of his palace, to the door of a lofty
      chamber, which he opened with a key that he took from a niche
      in the wall. On entering the room, Jochonan saw that it was
      of solid silver&mdash;floor, ceiling, walls, even to the
      threshold and the door-posts. And the curiously carved roof,
      and borders of the ceiling, shone, in the torch-light, as if
      they were the fanciful work of frost. In the midst were heaps
      of silver money, piled up in immense urns of the same metal,
      even over the brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou hast done me a serviceable act, Rabbi," said the
      Demon&mdash;"take of these what thou pleasest; ay, were it
      the whole."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot, my lord," said Jochonan. "I was adjured by thee to
      come hither in the name of God; and in that name I came, not
      for fee or for reward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Follow me," said the prince of the Mazikin; and Jochonan did
      so, into an inner chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of gold, as the other was of silver. Its golden roof
      was supported by pillars and pilasters of gold, resting upon
      a golden floor. The treasures of the kings of the earth would
      not purchase one of the four-and-twenty vessels of golden
      coins, which were disposed in six rows along the room. No
      wonder! for they were filled by the constant labours of the
      Demons of the mine. The heart of Jochonan was moved by
      avarice, when he saw them shining in yellow light, like the
      autumnal sun, as they reflected the beams of the torch. But
      God enabled him to persevere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are thine," said the Demon; "one of the vessels which
      thou beholdest would make thee richest of the sons of
      men&mdash;and I give thee them all."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jochonan refused again; and the Prince of the Mazikin
      opened the door of a third chamber, which was called the Hall
      of Diamonds. When the Rabbi entered, he screamed aloud, and
      put his hands over his eyes; for the lustre of the jewels
      dazzled him, as if he had looked upon the noon-day sun. In
      vases of agate were heaped diamonds beyond enumeration, the
      smallest of which was larger
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page413" name="page413"></a>[pg
      413]</span> than a pigeon's egg. On alabaster tables lay
      amethysts, topazes, rubies, beryls, and all other precious
      stones, wrought by the hands of skilful artists, beyond power
      of computation. The room was lighted by a carbuncle, which,
      from the end of the hall, poured its ever-living light,
      brighter than the rays of noontide, but cooler than the
      gentle radiance of the dewy moon. This was a sore trial on
      the Rabbi; but he was strengthened from above, and he refused
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou knowest me then, I perceive, O Jochonan, son of
      Ben-David," said the Prince of the Mazikin; "I am a Demon who
      would tempt thee to destruction. As thou hast withstood so
      far, I tempt thee no more. Thou hast done a service which,
      though I value it not, is acceptable in the sight of her
      whose love is dearer to me than the light of life. Sad has
      been that love to thee, my Rebecca! Why should I do that
      which would make thy cureless grief more grievous? You have
      yet another chamber to see," said he to Jochonan, who had
      closed his eyes, and was praying fervently to the Lord,
      beating his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far different from the other chambers, the one into which the
      Rabbi was next introduced, was a mean and paltry apartment,
      without furniture. On its filthy walls hung innumerable
      bunches of rusty keys, of all sizes, disposed without order.
      Among them, to the astonishment of Jochonan, hung the keys of
      his own house, those which he had put to hide when he came on
      this miserable journey, and he gazed upon them intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What dost thou see," said the Demon, "that makes thee look
      so eagerly? Can he who has refused silver, and gold, and
      diamonds, be moved by a paltry bunch of rusty iron?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are mine own, my lord," said the Rabbi, "them will I
      take, if they be offered me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take them, then," said the Demon, putting them into his
      hand;&mdash;"thou may'st depart. But, Rabbi, open not thy
      house only, when thou returnest to Cairo, but thy heart also.
      That thou didst not open it before, was that which gave me
      power over thee. It was well that thou didst one act of
      charity in coming with me without reward, for it has been thy
      salvation. Be no more Rabbi Jochonan the miser."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rabbi bowed to the ground, and blessed the Lord for his
      escape. "But how," said he, "am I to return, for I know not
      the way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Close thine eyes," said the Demon. He did so, and in the
      space of a moment, heard the voice of the Prince of Mazikin
      ordering him to open them again. And, behold, when he opened
      them, he stood in the centre of his own chamber, in his house
      at Cairo, with the keys in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he recovered from his surprise, and had offered
      thanksgivings to God, he opened his house, and his heart
      also. He gave alms to the poor, he cheered the heart of the
      widow, and lightened the destitution of the orphan. His
      hospitable board was open to the stranger, and his purse was
      at the service of all who needed to share it. His life was a
      perpetual act of benevolence; and the blessings showered upon
      him by all, were returned bountifully upon him by the hand of
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But people wondered, and said, "Is not this the man who was
      called Rabbi Jochonan the miser? What hath made the change?"
      And it became a saying in Cairo. When it came to the ears of
      the Rabbi, he called his friends together, and he avowed his
      former love of gold, and the danger to which it had exposed
      him; relating all which has been above told, in the hall of
      the new palace that he built by the side of the river, on the
      left hand, as thou goest down by the course of the great
      stream. And wise men, who were scribes, wrote it down from
      his mouth, for the memory of mankind, that they might profit
      thereby. And a venerable man, with a beard of snow, who had
      read it in these books, and at whose feet I sat, that I might
      learn the wisdom of the old time, told it to me. And I write
      it in the tongue of England, the merry and the free, on the
      tenth day of the month Nisan, in the year, according to the
      lesser computation, five hundred ninety and seven, that thou
      may'st learn good thereof. If not, the fault be upon thee.

      Mr. Watts, the editor, besides the stanzas we have quoted,
      has contributed indeed less than other editors, in similar
      works, and much less than we could wish, for we are sincere
      admirers of his plaintive muse. His preface should be read
      with due attention, for it is calculated to set the public
      right on the <i>fate and merit</i> of numberless works.

    <h3>
      A COUNTRY APOTHECARY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the most important personages in a small country town
      is the apothecary. He takes rank next after the rector and
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page415" name="page415"></a>[pg
      415]</span> the attorney, and before the curate; and could be
      much less easily dispensed with than either of those
      worthies, not merely as holding "fate and physic" in his
      hand, but as the general, and as it were official, associate,
      adviser, comforter, and friend, of all ranks and all ages, of
      high and low, rich and poor, sick and well. I am no despiser
      of dignities; but twenty emperors shall be less intensely
      missed in their wide dominions, than such a man as my friend
      John Hallett in his own small sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spot which was favoured with the residence of this
      excellent person was the small town of Hazelby, in
      Dorsetshire; a pretty little place, where every thing seems
      at a stand-still. It was originally built in the shape of the
      letter T; a long broad market-place (still so called,
      although the market be gone) serving for the perpendicular
      stem, traversed by a straight, narrow, horizontal street, to
      answer for the top line. Not one addition has occurred to
      interrupt this architectural regularity, since, fifty years
      ago, a rich London tradesman built, at the west end of the
      horizontal street, a wide-fronted single house, with two low
      wings, iron palisades before, and a fish-pond opposite, which
      still goes by the name of New Place, and is balanced, at the
      east end of the street, by an erection of nearly the same
      date, a large square dingy mansion enclosed within high
      walls, inhabited by three maiden sisters, and called,
      probably by way of nickname, the Nunnery. New Place being on
      the left of the road, and the Nunnery on the right, the T has
      now something of the air of the italic capital T, turned up
      at one end and down at the other. The latest improvements are
      the bow-window in the market-place, commanding the pavement
      both ways, which the late brewer, Andrews, threw out in his
      snug parlour some twenty years back, and where he used to sit
      smoking, with the sash up, in summer afternoons, enjoying
      himself, good man; and the great room, at the Swan,
      originally built by the speculative publican, Joseph
      Allwright, for an assembly-room. That speculation did not
      answer. The assembly, in spite of canvassing and patronage,
      and the active exertions of all the young ladies in the
      neighbourhood, dwindled away, and died at the end of two
      winters: then it became a club-room for the hunt; but the
      hunt quarrelled with Joseph's cookery: then a market-room for
      the farmers; but the farmers (it was in the high-price time)
      quarrelled with Joseph's wine: then it was converted into the
      magistrate's room&mdash;the bench; but the bench and the
      market went away together, and there was an end of justicing:
      then Joseph tried the novel attraction (to borrow a
      theatrical phrase) of a billiard-table; but, alas! that
      novelty succeeded as ill as if it had been theatrical; there
      were not customers enough to pay the marker: at last, it has
      merged finally in that unconscious receptacle of pleasure and
      pain, a post-office; although Hazelby has so little to do
      with traffic of any sort&mdash;even the traffic of
      correspondence&mdash;that a saucy mail-coach will often carry
      on its small bag, and as often forget to call for the London
      bag in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, Hazelby is an insignificant place;&mdash;my readers
      will look for it in vain in the map of Dorsetshire;&mdash;it
      is omitted, poor dear town!&mdash;left out by the map-maker
      with as little remorse as a dropped letter!&mdash;and it is
      also an old-fashioned place. It has not even a cheap shop for
      female gear. Every thing in the one store which it boasts,
      kept by Martha Deane, linen-draper and haberdasher, is dear
      and good, as things were wont to be. You may actually get
      there thread made of flax, from the gouty, uneven, clumsy,
      shiny fabric, ycleped whited-brown, to the delicate commodity
      of Lisle, used for darning muslin. I think I was never more
      astonished, from the mere force of habit, than when, on
      asking for thread, I was presented, instead of the pretty
      lattice-wound balls, or snowy reels of cotton, with which
      that demand is usually answered, with a whole drawerful of
      skeins peeping from their blue papers &mdash;such skeins as
      in my youth a thrifty maiden would draw into the
      nicely-stitched compartments of that silken repository, a
      housewife, or fold into a congeries of graduated
      thread-papers, "fine by degrees, and beautifully less." The
      very literature of Hazelby is doled out at the pastry cook's,
      in a little one-windowed shop kept by Matthew Wise. Tarts
      occupy one end of the counter, and reviews the other; whilst
      the shelves are parcelled out between books, and dolls, and
      ginger, bread. It is a question, by which of his trades poor
      Matthew gains least; he is so shabby, so threadbare, and so
      starved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a town would hardly have known what to do with a highly
      informed and educated surgeon, such as one now generally sees
      in that most liberal profession. My friend, John Hallett,
      suited it exactly. His predecessor, Mr. Simon Saunders, had
      been a small, wrinkled, spare old gentleman, with a short
      cough and a thin voice, who always seemed as if he needed an
      apothecary himself. He wore generally a full suit of drab, a
      flaxen wig of the sort called a Bob Jerom, and a very tight
      muslin stock; a costume which he
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page416" name="page416"></a>[pg
      416]</span> had adopted in his younger days in imitation of
      the most eminent physician of the next city, and continued to
      the time of his death. Perhaps the cough might have been
      originally an imitation also, ingrafted on the system by
      habit. It had a most unsatisfactory sound, and seemed more
      like a trick than a real effort of nature. His talk was
      civil, prosy, and fidgetty: much addicted to small scandal,
      and that kind of news which passes under the denomination of
      tittle-tattle, he was sure to tell one half of the town where
      the other drank tea, and recollected the blancmanges and
      jellies on a supper-table, or described a new gown, with as
      much science and unction as if he had been used to make
      jellies and wear gowns in his own person. Certain
      professional peculiarities might have favoured the
      supposition. His mode of practice was exactly that popularly
      attributed to old women. He delighted in innocent
      remedies&mdash;manna, magnesia, and camphor julep; never put
      on a blister in his life; and would sooner, from pure
      complaisance, let a patient die, than administer an
      unpalatable prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      So qualified, to say nothing of his gifts in tea-drinking,
      cassino, and quadrille (whist was too many for him), his
      popularity could not be questioned. When he expired, all
      Hazelby mourned. The lamentation was general. The women of
      every degree (to borrow a phrase from that great
      phrase-monger, Horace Walpole) "cried quarts;" and the
      procession to the churchyard&mdash;that very churchyard to
      which he had himself attended so many of his
      patients&mdash;was now followed by all of them that remained
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was felt that the successor of Mr. Simon Saunders would
      have many difficulties to encounter. My friend, John Hallett,
      "came, and saw, and overcame." John was what is usually
      called a rough diamond. Imagine a short, clumsy, stout-built
      figure, almost as broad as it is long, crowned by a bullet
      head, covered with shaggy brown hair, sticking out in every
      direction; the face round and solid, with a complexion
      originally fair, but dyed one red by exposure to all sorts of
      weather; open good-humoured eyes, of a greenish cast, his
      admirers called them hazel; a wide mouth, full of large white
      teeth; a cocked-up nose, and a double chin; bearing
      altogether a strong resemblance to a print which I once saw
      hanging up in an alehouse parlour, of "the celebrated divine
      (to use the identical words of the legend) Dr. Martin
      Luther."
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of a country apothecary being peculiarly liable
      to the inclemency of the season, John's dress was generally
      such as might bid defiance to wind, or rain, or snow, or
      hail. If any thing, he wrapt up most in the summer, having a
      theory that people were never so apt to take cold as in hot
      weather. He usually wore a bearskin great-coat, a silk
      handkerchief over his cravat, top boots on those sturdy
      pillars his legs, a huge pair of overalls, and a hat, which,
      from, the day in which it first came into his possession to
      that in which it was thrown aside, never knew the comfort of
      being freed from its oilskin&mdash;never was allowed to
      display the glossy freshness of its sable youth. Poor dear
      hat! how its vanity (if hats have vanity) must have suffered!
      For certain its owner had none, unless a lurking pride in his
      own bluffness and bluntness may be termed such. He piqued
      himself on being a plain downright Englishman, and on a voice
      and address pretty much like his apparel, rough, strong, and
      warm, fit for all weathers. A heartier person never lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his profession he was eminently skilful, bold, confident,
      and successful. The neighbouring physicians liked to come
      after Mr. Hallett; they were sure to find nothing to undo.
      And blunt and abrupt as was his general manner, he was kind
      and gentle in a sick-room; only nervous disorders, the pet
      diseases of Mr. Simon Saunders, he could not abide. He made
      short work with them; frightened them away as one does by
      children when they have the hiccough; or if the malady were
      pertinacious and would not go, he fairly turned off the
      patient. Once or twice, indeed, on such occasions, the
      patient got the start, and turned him off; Mrs. Emery, for
      instance, the lady's maid at New Place, most delicate and
      mincing of waiting-gentlewomen, motioned him from her
      presence; and Miss Deane, daughter of Martha Deane,
      haberdasher, who, after completing her education at a
      boarding-school, kept a closet full of millinery in a little
      den behind her mamma's shop, and was by many degrees the
      finest lady in Hazelby, was so provoked at being told by him
      that nothing ailed her, that, to prove her weakly condition,
      she pushed him by main force out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these exceptions Mr. Hallett was the delight of the
      whole town, as well as of all the farm-houses within six
      miles round. He just suited the rich yeomanry, cured their
      diseases, and partook of their feasts; was constant at
      christenings, and a man of prime importance at weddings. A
      country merry-making was nothing without "the Doctor." He was
      "the very prince of good fellows;" had
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page417" name="page417"></a>[pg
      417]</span> a touch of epicurism, which, without causing any
      distaste of his own homely fare, made dainties acceptable
      when they fell in his way; was a most absolute carver; prided
      himself upon a sauce of his own invention, for fish and
      game&mdash;"Hazelby sauce" he called it; and was universally
      admitted to be the best compounder of a bowl of punch in the
      county.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these rare convivial accomplishments, his gay and
      jovial temper rendered him the life of the table. There was
      no resisting his droll faces, his droll stories, his jokes,
      his tricks, or his laugh&mdash;the most contagious
      cachination that ever was heard. Nothing in the shape of fun
      came amiss to him. He would join in a catch or roar out a
      solo, which might be heard a mile off; would play at hunt the
      slipper or blind man's buff; was a great man in a country
      dance, and upon very extraordinary occasions would treat the
      company to a certain remarkable hornpipe, which put the walls
      in danger of tumbling about their ears, and belonged to him
      as exclusively as the Hazelby sauce. It was a sort of parody
      on a pas seul which he had once seen at the Opera-house, in
      which his face, his figure, his costume, his rich humour, and
      his strange, awkward, unexpected activity, told amazingly.
      "The force of <i>frolic</i> could no farther go" than "the
      Doctor's hornpipe," It was the climax of jollity.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In his shop and his household he had no need either of
      partner or of wife: the one was excellently managed by an old
      rheumatic journeyman, slow in speech, and of vinegar aspect,
      who had been a pedagogue in his youth, and now used to limp
      about with his Livy in his pocket, and growl as he compounded
      the medicines over the bad latinity of the prescriptions; the
      other was equally well conducted by an equally ancient
      housekeeper and a cherry-cheeked niece, the orphan-daughter
      of his only sister, who kept every thing within doors in the
      bright and shining order in which he delighted. John Hallett,
      notwithstanding the roughness of his aspect, was rather
      knick-knacky in his tastes; a great patron of small
      inventions, such as the <i>improved</i> ne plus ultra
      cork-screw, and the latest patent snuffers. He also trifled
      with horticulture, dabbled in tulips, was a connoisseur in
      pinks, and had gained a prize for polyanthuses. The garden
      was under the especial care of his pretty niece, Miss Susan,
      a grateful warm-hearted girl, who thought she never could do
      enough to please her good uncle, and prove her sense of his
      kindness. He was indeed as fond of her as if he had been her
      father, and as kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps there was nothing very extraordinary in his goodness
      to the gentle and cheerful little girl who kept his walks so
      trim and his parlour so neat, who always met him with a
      smile, and who (last and strongest tie to a generous mind)
      was wholly dependent on him&mdash;had no friend on earth but
      himself. There was nothing very uncommon in that. But John
      Hallett was kind to every one, even where the sturdy old
      English prejudices, which he cherished as virtues, might seem
      most likely to counteract his gentler feelings.

      We have only room to particularize the <i>Boroom Slave</i>,
      by Mrs. Bowditch; the <i>Magician's Visiter</i>, by Neele;
      and <i>Scenes in the Life of a Favourite</i>; all which
      possess very powerful interest. Mr. Hood, too, has two
      oddities&mdash;<i>Death in the Kitchen</i>, after Sterne, and
      the <i>Logicians</i>, accompanied by engravings. Indeed, the
      literary variety of the present <i>Forget Me Not</i> is
      highly creditable to the editor, Mr. Shoberl.

    <h2>
      FRIENDSHIP'S OFFERING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To begin with the exterior, which is somewhat novel in taste,
      the proprietors seem to have united the <i>utile cum
      dulci,</i> by substituting for the usual paper covering, an
      elegantly embossed leather binding. This is altogether an
      improvement on the original plan, since the slight coverings
      of silk or paper is scarcely safe out of the drawing-room or
      boudoir, and some of the contributions to the "annuals"
      entitle them to a higher stand. The presentation plate of the
      present <i>Offering</i> is a chaste and classical specimen of
      a kind of gold enamel engraving; <i>The Sylph</i>, engraved
      by Humphreys, is a pleasing picture; <i>Virginia Water</i>,
      from a picture by Daniell, is a delightful scene of rural
      repose; a <i>Sculpture Group</i>, by Fry; a <i>View of
      Bombay</i>; and the <i>Captive Slave</i>, by Finden; among
      the embellishments, are entitled to our commendatory notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present editor is Mr. Charles Knight, who, according to
      his preface, succeeded "at an advanced period of the year to
      the duties which had previously been performed by a gentleman
      of acknowledged taste and ability." This may account for the
      imperfect state of some of the engravings; but the apology is
      not so requisite for the execution of the literary portion of
      the present volume. Our extracts must be short, for we have
      other claimants to our attention. The <i>Housekeepers</i>, a
      Shandean extract, is from one of the best prose
      contributors:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two heavy, middle-aged merchants; they were either
      Dutch or German, I know not which, but their name was
      Vanderclump. Most decided old bachelors they were, with
      large, leathern, hanging cheeks, sleepy grey eyes, and round
      shoulders. They were men not given to much speech, but great
      feeders; and, when waited upon, would point clumsily to what
      they wanted, and make a sort of low growl, rather than be at
      the trouble to speak. These Messrs. Vanderclump were served
      by two tall, smooth-faced dawdles; I never could discover
      which held the superior station in the <i>m&eacute;nage</i>.
      Each has been seen trotting home from market with a basket on
      her arm; each might be observed to shake a duster out of the
      upper windows; each would, occasionally, carry a huge bunch
      of keys, or wait at table during dinner; and, in the summer
      evenings, when it was not post-day, both of them would
      appear, dressed alike, sitting at work at the lower
      counting-house window, with the blinds thrown wide open.
      Both, I suppose, were housekeepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, one cold, foggy spring, that the younger
      brother, Mr. Peter Vanderclump, left London to transact some
      business of importance with a correspondent at Hamburgh,
      leaving his brother Anthony to the loneliness of their gloomy
      house in St. Mary Axe. Week after week passed away, and Mr.
      Peter was still detained at Hamburgh. Who would have supposed
      that his society could have been missed? that the parlour
      could have seemed more dismally dull by the absence of one of
      those from whom it chiefly derived its character of dulness?
      Mr. Anthony took up his largest meerchaum, and enveloped
      himself in its smoke by the hour; but the volumes of smoke
      cleared away, and no Peter Vanderclump appeared emerging from
      the mist. Mr. Anthony brought some of his heavy folios from
      below; and, in their pages of interest, (no common, but often
      compound, interest,) lost, for awhile, the dreary sense of
      loneliness. But, a question was to be asked! Peter's solemn
      "yah" or "nien" was waited for in vain. Forgetful, and almost
      impatient, Anthony looked up&mdash;the chair was unoccupied
      which his brother had constantly filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Anthony began to sigh&mdash;he got into a habit of
      sighing. Betty and Molly (they were soft-hearted baggages)
      felt for their master&mdash;pitied their poor master! Betty
      was placing the supper on the table one evening, when her
      master sighed very heavily. Betty sighed also, and the
      corners of her mouth fell&mdash;their eyes
      met&mdash;something like a blush crimsoned Betty's sleek,
      shining cheek, when, on raising her eyes again, her master
      was still staring at her. Betty simpered, and, in her very
      soft, very demure voice ventured to say, "Was there any thing
      she could do?" Mr. Vanderclump rose up from his chair. Betty,
      for the first time, felt awed by his approach. "Batee!" he
      said, "my poor Batee! Hah! you are a goot girl!" He chucked
      her under the chin with his large hand. Betty looked meek,
      and blushed, and simpered again. There was a pause&mdash;Mr.
      Vanderclump was the first to disturb it. "Hah! hah!" he
      exclaimed, gruffly, as if suddenly recollecting himself; and,
      thrusting both hands into his capacious breeches-pockets, he
      sat down to supper, and took no further notice of Betty that
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, the sun seemed to have made a successful
      struggle with the dense London atmosphere, and shone full in
      Mr. Vanderclump's face while he was at breakfast, and set a
      piping bullfinch singing a tune, which his master loved
      rather for the sake of old associations, than from any
      delight in music. Then Lloyd's
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page419" name="page419"></a>[pg
      419]</span> List was full of arrivals, and the Price Current
      had that morning some unusual charm about it, which I cannot
      even guess at. Mr. Vanderclump looked upon the bright and
      blazing fire; his eye rested, with a calm and musing
      satisfaction, on the light volumes of steam rising from the
      spout of the tea-kettle, as it stood, rather murmuring
      drowsily, than hissing, upon the hob. There was, he might
      have felt, a sympathy between them. They were both placidly
      puffing out the warm and wreathing smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid down his pipe, and took half a well-buttered muffin
      into his capacious mouth at a bite; he washed the mouthful
      down, with a large dish of tea, and he felt in better
      spirits. That morning he entered the counting-house rubbing
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within an hour a crowd of huge, dusky clouds shut out the
      merry sunshine, and the Hamburgh mail brought no tidings
      whatever of Mr. Peter. Mr. Anthony worked himself up into a
      thorough ill-humour again, and swore at his clerks, because
      they asked him questions. When he entered his apartment that
      evening he felt more desolate than ever. Betty placed a
      barrel of oysters on the table&mdash;he heeded her
      not;&mdash;a large German sausage&mdash;his eyes were fixed
      on the ground;&mdash;a piece of Hamburgh beef &mdash;Mr.
      Vanderclump looked up for an instant, and, Europa-like, his
      thoughts crossed the sea, upon that beef, to Hamburgh.
      Gradually, however, a genial warmth spread throughout the
      room, for Betty stirred up the fire, and let down the
      curtains, and snuffed the dim candles; while Molly loaded the
      table with bottles of divers shapes and sizes, a basin of
      snow-white sugar, and a little basket of limes, of well-known
      and exquisite flavour; placing, at the same time, a very
      small kettle of boiling water on the fire.&mdash;"Why,
      Mollee! my goot girl!" said Mr. Vanderclump, in a low and
      somewhat melancholy tone, (his eyes had mechanically followed
      these latter proceedings,) "Mollee! that is ponch!"
      &mdash;"La, sir! and why not?" replied the damsel, almost
      playfully. "Why not be comfortable and cheery? I am
      sure"&mdash;and here she meant to look encouraging, her usual
      simper spreading to a smile&mdash;"I am sure Betty and I
      would do our best to make you so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goot girls, goot girls!" said Mr. Vanderclump, his eyes
      fixed all the while upon the supper-table&mdash;he sat down
      to it. "My goot girls!" said he, soon after, "you may go
      down; I do not want you; you need not wait." The two timid,
      gentle creatures instantly obeyed. More than an hour elapsed,
      and then Mr. Vanderclump's bell rang. The two matronly
      maidens were very busily employed in making a new cap. Betty
      rose at once; but suddenly recollecting that she had been
      trying on her new and unfinished cap, and had then only a
      small brown cotton skull-cap on her head, she raised both her
      hands to her head to be certain of this, and then said, "Do,
      Molly, there's a dear! answer the bell; for such a figure as
      I am, I could not go before master, no how. See, I have
      unpicked this old cap for a little bit of French edging at
      the back." Molly looked a little peevish; but <i>her</i> cap
      was on her head, and up stairs she went. Mr. Vanderclump was
      sitting before the fire, puffing lustily from his eternal
      pipe. "Take away," he said abruptly, "and put the leetle
      table here." He pointed and growled, and the sagacious Molly
      understood. She placed the table beside him, and upon it the
      punch, which he had been drinking. "Batee, my poor Batee!"
      said Mr. Vanderclump, who had not yet noticed that Betty was
      absent. "It is not Betty, but Molly, sir!" replied the latter
      damsel, in a voice of childlike simplicity. "Hah!" said he,
      apparently considering for a moment, "Hah! Batee, Mollee, all
      the same! Mollee, my poor Mollee, you are a goot girl! Get up
      to-morrow morning, my poor Mollee, and put on your best gown,
      and I will marry you!" Molly, was, as she afterwards
      declared, struck all of a heap. She gaped, and gasped with
      astonishment; and then a power of words were rushing and
      racing up her throat to her tongue's end: a glance at her
      master stopped their explosion. His hands were in his
      pockets, his face towards the fire, his pipe in his mouth.
      "Yes, sir," she replied, humbly and distinctly. A few tears
      trickled down her cheeks, as she curtseyed low at the door,
      and disappeared. She knew his ways, she thought within
      herself, as she walked very slowly down the stairs, and she
      congratulated herself that she had not risked another word in
      reply. "And now, Betty," she said, as she entered the
      kitchen, "I'll put the finishing stitch to my cap, and go to
      bed, for master will want nothing more to-night." She sat
      down quietly to work, and conversed quietly with Betty, not
      disclosing a word of her new prospects, Betty, however,
      observed that she took off the trimming with which her new
      cap had been already half-adorned. "Why, bless me, Molly!"
      she cried, "you are not going to put on that handsome white
      satin bow, are you?"&mdash;"Why, yes! I think I shall,"
      replied Molly, "for now I look at your cap, with that there
      yellow riband upon it, mine seems to me quite old-maidish."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page420" name="page420"></a>[pg
      420]</span> The next morning, Molly got up before her sister,
      and put on her best gown and her new cap. The morning was
      dark and dull, and Betty was sleepy, and Molly kept the
      window-curtain and the bed-curtains closely drawn.
      Unsuspected, she slipped out of the chamber, her shawl and
      her bonnet in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clock struck eight, Molly was standing beside her
      master before the rails of the marriage-altar; and, not long
      after, she burst upon the astonished eyes of her sister, as
      Mrs. Vanderclump.

      <i>La Villegiatura</i> is a pleasant article; but we do not
      think there is much of the "love of pastoral associations"
      left in the English character, and we are sorry for it. The
      <i>Rustic Wreath</i>, by Miss Mitford, is very sweet; the
      <i>Cacadore</i>, a story of the peninsular war, is a
      soul-stirring narrative; there is much pleasantry in Mrs.
      Hofland's <i>Comforts of Conceitedness; Virginia Water</i>,
      by the editor, could hardly be written by his
      fireside&mdash;it has too much local inspiration in every
      line; <i>Auguste de Valcour</i>, by the author of <i>Gilbert
      Earle</i>, is in his usual felicitous vein of philosophic
      melancholy; Miss Roberts has a glittering <i>Tale of
      Normandy</i>; the <i>Orphans</i>, by the editor, is simple

    <h3>
      THE LAST VOYAGE. A TRUE STORY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>By Mrs. Opie.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot fail to observe, as we advance in life, how vividly
      our earliest recollections recur to us, and this
      consciousness is accompanied by a melancholy pleasure, when
      we are deprived of those
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page421" name="page421"></a>[pg
      421]</span> who are most tenderly associated with such
      remembrances, because they bring the beloved dead "before our
      mind's eye;" and beguile the loneliness of the <i>present</i>
      hour, by visions of the <i>past</i>. In such visions I now
      often love to indulge, and in one of them, a journey to
      Y&mdash;&mdash; was recently brought before me, in which my
      ever-indulgent father permitted me to accompany him, when I
      was yet but a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we drove through C&mdash;&mdash;r, a village within three
      miles of Y&mdash;&mdash;, he directed my attention to a
      remarkable <i>rising</i>, or <i>conical mound of earth</i>,
      on the top of the tower of C&mdash;&mdash;r church. He then
      kindly explained the cause of this singular, and
      <i>distinguishing</i> appearance, and told me the
      traditionary anecdote connected with it; which now, in my own
      words, I am going to communicate to my readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is generally supposed, that great grief makes the heart so
      selfishly absorbed in its own sufferings, as to render it
      regardless of the sufferings of others; but the conduct of
      her, who is the heroine of the following tale, will prove to
      this general rule an honourable exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know nothing of her birth, and parentage, nor am I
      acquainted even with her name&mdash;but I shall call her
      Birtha&mdash;the story goes, that she lived at
      C&mdash;&mdash;r, a village three miles from Y&mdash;&mdash;
      in N&mdash;&mdash;, and was betrothed to the mate of a
      trading vessel, with the expectation of marrying him, when he
      had gained money sufficient, by repeated voyages, to make
      their union consistent with prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, there is reason to believe that Birtha was
      not idle, but contrived to earn money herself, in order to
      expedite the hour of her marriage; and at length, her lover
      (whom I shall call William) thought that there was no reason
      for him to continue his sea-faring life, but at the end of
      one voyage more, he should be able to marry the woman of his
      choice, and engage in some less dangerous employment, in his
      native village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the next time that he bade farewell to Birtha,
      the sorrow of their parting hour was soothed by William's
      declaring, that, as the next voyage would be his last, he
      should expect, when he returned, to find every thing ready
      for their marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a pleasant expectation, and Birtha eagerly prepared
      to fulfil it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time that Birtha was beginning to believe that William
      was on his voyage home, her neighbours would often help her
      to count the days which would probably elapse before the ship
      could arrive; but when they were not in her presence, some of
      the experienced amongst the men used to express a
      <i>hope</i>, the result of <i>fear</i>, that William would
      return time enough to avoid <i>certain winds</i>, which made
      one part of the navigation on that coast particularly
      dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birtha herself, had, no doubt, her <i>fears</i>, as well as
      her <i>hopes</i>; but there are <i>some</i> fears which the
      lip of affection dares not utter, and this was one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birtha dreaded to have her inquiries respecting that
      dangerous passage, answered by "Yes, we know that it is a
      difficult navigation;" she also dreaded to be told by some
      kind, but ill-judging friends, to "trust in Providence;" as,
      by such advice, the reality of the danger would be still more
      powerfully confirmed to her. This recommendation would to her
      have been needless, as well as alarming; for she had,
      doubtless, always relied on Him who is alone able to save,
      and she knew that the same "Almighty arm was underneath" her
      lover still, which had hitherto preserved him in the time of
      need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;time went on, and we will imagine the little
      garden before the door of the house which Birtha had hired,
      new gravelled, fresh flowers sown and planted there; the
      curtains ready to be put up; the shelves bright with polished
      utensils; table linen, white as the driven snow, enclosed in
      the newly-purchased chest of drawers; and the neat, well
      chosen wedding-clothes, ready for the approaching occasion:
      we will also picture to ourselves, the trembling joy of
      Birtha, when her eager and sympathizing neighbours rushed
      into her cottage, disturbing her early breakfast, with the
      glad tidings, that William's ship had been seen approaching
      the dangerous passage with a fair wind, and that there was no
      doubt but that he would get over it safe, and in day-light!
      How sweet is it to be the messenger and the bearer of good
      news, but it is still sweeter to know that one has friends
      who have pleasure in communicating pleasure to us!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Birtha's joy was still mingled with anxiety, and she
      probably passed that day in alternate restlessness and
      prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards night the wind rose high, blowing from a quarter
      unfavourable to the safety of the ship, and it still
      continued to blow in this direction when night and darkness
      had closed on all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness at that moment seemed to close also upon the
      prospects of Birtha! for she knew that there was no beacon,
      no landmark to warn the vessel of its danger, and inform the
      pilot what coast they were approaching, and what perils they
      were to avoid; and, it is probable, that the almost
      despairing girl was, with
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page422" name="page422"></a>[pg
      422]</span> her anxious friends, that livelong night a
      restless wanderer on the nearest shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the return of morning came the awful confirmation of
      their worst fears!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no remaining vestige of William's vessel, save the
      top of the mast, which shewed where it had sunk beneath the
      waves, and proved that the hearts which in the morning had
      throbbed high with tender hopes and joyful expectations were
      then cold and still "beneath the mighty waters!" How
      different now was the scene in Birtha's cottage, to that
      which it exhibited during the preceding morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      That changed dwelling was not indeed deserted, for
      sympathizing neighbours came to it as before; but though many
      may be admitted with readiness when it is a time for
      congratulation, it is only the few who can be welcome in a
      season of sorrow; and Birtha's sorrow, though <i>quiet</i>,
      was <i>deep</i>&mdash;while neither her nearest relative, nor
      dearest friend, could do any thing to assist her, save, by
      removing from her sight the new furniture, or the new
      dresses, which had been prepared for those happy hours that
      now could never be hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, Birtha, who had always appeared calm and
      resigned, seemed cheerful also! still she remained pale, as
      in the first moments of her trial, save when a feverish flush
      occasionally increased the brightness of her eyes; but she
      grew thinner and thinner, and her impeded breath made her
      affectionate friends suspect that she was going into a rapid
      decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medical aid was immediately called in, and Birtha's pleased
      conviction that her end was near, was soon, though
      reluctantly confirmed to her, at her own request.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is afflicting to see an invalid rejoice in knowing that
      the hour of death is certainly approaching; because it proves
      the depth and poignancy of the previous sufferings: but then
      the sight is comforting and edifying also. It is
      <i>comforting</i>, because it proves that the dying person is
      supported by the only "help that faileth not;" and it is
      edifying, because it invites those who behold it to endeavour
      to <i>believe</i>, that they also may live and <i>die</i>
      like the departing Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not alone the wish "to die and be with Christ,"
      nor the sweet expectation of being united in another world to
      him whom she had lost, that was the cause of Birtha's
      increasing cheerfulness, as the hour of her dissolution drew
      nigh. No&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her generous heart was rejoicing in a project which she had
      conceived, and which would, if realized, be the source of
      benefit to numbers yet unborn. She knew from authority which
      she could not doubt, that had there been a <i>proper
      landmark</i> on the shore, her lover and his ship would not,
      in all human probability, have perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Birtha, "henceforth there shall be a land-mark
      on this coast! and I will furnish it! Here at least, no fond
      and faithful girl shall again have to lament over her
      blighted prospects, and pine, and suffer as I have done."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent immediately for the clergyman of the parish, made
      her will, and had a clause inserted to the following effect:
      "I desire that I may be buried on the top of the tower of
      C&mdash;&mdash;r church! and that my grave may be made very
      high, and pointed, in order to render it a perpetual
      land-mark to all ships approaching that dangerous navigation
      where he whom I loved was wrecked. I am assured, that, had
      there been a land-mark on the tower of C&mdash;&mdash;
      church, his ship might have escaped; and I humbly trust, that
      my grave will always be kept up, according to my will, to
      prevent affectionate hearts, in future, from being afflicted
      as mine has been; and I leave a portion of my little property
      in the hands of trustees, for ever, to pay for the
      preservation of the above-mentioned grave, in all its
      usefulness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she died, the judicious and benevolent sufferer had
      the satisfaction of being assured, that her intentions would
      be carried into effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her last moments were therefore cheered by the belief, that
      she would be graciously permitted to be, even after death, a
      benefit to others, and that her grave might be the means of
      preserving some of her fellow-creatures from shipwreck and
      affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was her belief a delusive one&mdash;-The conical grave in
      question gives so remarkable an appearance to the tower of
      C&mdash;&mdash;r church, when it is seen at sea, even at a
      distance, that if once observed it can never be forgotten,
      even by those to whom the anecdote connected with it is
      unknown &mdash;therefore, as soon as it appears in sight,
      pilots know that they are approaching a dangerous coast, and
      take measures to avoid its perils.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the navigation on that coast is no longer as perilous
      as it was, when the heroine of this story was buried, and the
      tower of C&mdash;&mdash;r church is no longer a necessary
      land-mark, still her grave remains a pleasing memorial of
      one, whose active benevolence rose superior to the
      selfishness both of sorrow and of sickness; and enabled her,
      even on the bed of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page423"
      name="page423"></a>[pg 423]</span> death, to <i>contrive</i>
      and <i>will</i> for the benefit of posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is strange, but true, that the name of this humble, but
      privileged being, is not on record; but many whose names are
      forgotten on earth, have been, I doubt not, received and
      rewarded in heaven.

      The Bijou

    <p>
      Is a new adventurer in the "annual" field, and deserves a
      foremost rank as a work of art. Thus, the <i>Child with
      Flowers</i>, by Humphreys, after Sir Thomas Laurence, is
      really fit company for the president's beautiful picture; the
      <i>Boy and Dog</i>, by the same painter and engraver, is also
      very fine; but the selection of both of the pictures for one
      volume is hardly judicious. With <i>Haddon Hall</i> our
      readers are already familiar. <i>Sans Souci</i>, after
      Stothard, is a delightful scene. In the literature, almost
      the only very striking composition is Sir Walter Scott's
      illustration of Wilkie's painting of the baronet's own
      family, which, having been copied into every newspaper, we do
      not reprint. For our part, we do not admire the painting;
      there is too much <i>rank and file</i> for a family group.
      Mr. Hood has a <i>Lament of Chivalry</i>, in his best style;
      and a few <i>Verses for an Album</i>, by Charles Lamb, are to
      our taste.

    <h2>
      THE LITERARY POCKET-BOOK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Is this year resumed, but we think it is not so successful
      as, were its previous <i>fasciculi</i>. The "<i>literary</i>"
      is a good epithet for its sale among would-be authors, like
      the "<i>Gentleman's</i>" Magazine among a certain class of
      worthies. But of what use are such articles as the following
      to literary men:&mdash;<i>The Seasons</i>, by a Man of
      <i>Taste</i>, (like the <i>carte</i> of a restaurateur;)
      <i>Sayings of a Man about Town; Remonstrance with J.F.
      Newton; Lines on Crockford's &amp;c.</i>&mdash;all amusing
      enough in their way, but, in a literary pocket-book, out of
      place, and not in good taste. The "lists," too, the only
      useful portion of the volume, are, in many instances, very
      incorrect. Apropos, how long has Morris Birbeck been dead?
      Our Illinois friend might be alive when the editor published
      his last pocket-book; but if he stands still, time does not.
      There is, too, an affectation of fashion about the work which
      does not suit our sober taste; but as a seasonable Christmas
      extract, we are induced to quote <i>Winter</i> from the
      <i>Seasons</i>:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now is the high season of beef; beef, which Prometheus killed
      for us at first, ere he filched the fire from heaven, with
      which to constitute it a beef-steak&mdash;that foundation of
      the most delightful of clubs, and origin of the most
      delightful of all memoirs of them. Nor be the sirloin, boast
      of Englishmen, forgot! nor its vaunted origin; which proves
      that the age of chivalry, despite of Burke, is not yet gone!
      Stewed beef too, and ample round, and <i>filet de boeuf saute
      dans sa glace</i>, and stewed rump-steaks, and ox-tail soup.
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "Spirits of beef, where are ye? are ye all fled?"
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      <i>Henry the Eighth</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;when beef flies the English shores, then you may, as
      the immortal bard exquisitely expresses it, "make a silken
      purse out of a sow's ear." But mutton, too, invites my Muse.
      It is calculated that fifteen hundred thousand sheep are
      annually sacrificed in London to the carnivorous taste of
      John Bull. "Of roast mutton (as Dr. Johnson says) what
      remains for me to say? It will be found sometimes succous,
      and sometimes defective of moisture; but what palate has ever
      failed to be pleased with a haunch which has been duly
      suspended? what appetite has not been awakened by the
      fermentation that glitters on its surface, when it has been
      reposing for the requisite number of hours before a fire
      equal in its fervency?"
    </p>
    <p>
      We quite agree with Dr. Johnson; but a boiled leg of mutton,
      its whiteness transparent through the verdant capers that
      decorate its candour, is not to be despised; nor is a hash,
      whether celebrated as an Irish stew, or a <i>hachis de
      mouton</i>, most relishing of <i>rifacciamenti</i>! Chops and
      garlic <i>&agrave; la Francaise</i> are exquisite; and the
      saddle, cut learnedly, is the Elysium of a gourmand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now also is the time of house-lamb and of doe-venison. Now is
      the time of Christmas come, and the voice of the turkey is
      heard in our land! This is the period of their annual
      massacre&mdash;a new slaughter of the innocents! The Norwich
      coaches are now laden with mortals; that, while alive, shared
      with their equally intelligent townsmen, <i>fruges consumere
      nati</i>, the riches of their agricultural county.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let others talk as they will about the Greek and the
      Ottoman!&mdash;in cookery, I abhor Greece, and love Turkey.
      And yet how inconsistent I am in my politics! for I sometimes
      regard the partition of Turkey as a thing well purchased by
      the sacrifice of every Ottoman in the world&mdash;would they
      were all <i>under my feet</i>!&mdash;especially when I have
      the gout. I confess, the dismemberment of Poland did not
      affect me much. A man who is much accustomed to dismember
      fowls, will not care much about that of kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor be the cod (a blessing on his head&mdash;and shoulders!)
      forgotten. Beautifully candid, his laminae separate readily
      before the tranchant silver, and each flake, covered with a
      creamy curd, lies ready to receive the affusion of molten
      (not oiled) butter, which, with its floating oyster-islands,
      seems in impatient agitation for the moment of overflowing
      the alluring "white creature," as a modern poet styles it.

      TIMES TELESCOPE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Having <i>transported</i> the public for the term of
      <i>fourteen years</i>, our readers need not be told that the
      present is the fifteenth volume. We should say more in its
      praise had it said less in our own. In richness and variety
      it is quite equal to any of its predecessors; and we promise
      our readers an occasional sip of its original sweets.
    </p>
    <hr class="full" />
    <p>
      The <i>Keepsake</i> and the <i>Christmas-Box</i> (the latter
      a <i>juvenile</i> annual) must stand over for an early
      number.

        We hope this epithet will not be considered
        ungallant&mdash;for, to say the truth, the <i>ladies</i>
        have contributed the best poetical portion of the feast.
        This display of female talent has increased in brilliancy
        year after year: and the <i>Lords</i> should look to it.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
