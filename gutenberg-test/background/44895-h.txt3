PREFACE.



Reader,


The great business of man's life, is to answer the end
for which he lives; and that is to glorify God and save his own
soul: this is the decree of Heaven, as old as the world. But so it is,
that man mindeth nothing less than what he should most mind;
and despiseth to inquire into his own being, its original duty and
end; choosing rather to dedicate his days (the steps he should make
to blessedness) to gratify the pride, avarice, and luxury of his heart:
as if he had been born for himself, or rather given himself being,
and so not subject to the reckoning and judgment of a superior
power. To this wild and lamentable pass hath poor man
brought himself by his disobedience to the law of God in his heart,
by doing that which he knows he should not do, and leaving undone
what he knows he should do. And as long as this disease continueth
upon man he will make his God his enemy, and himself
incapable of the love and salvation that He hath manifested, by his
Son Jesus Christ, to the world.

If, Reader, thou art such an one, my counsel to thee is, to retire
into thyself, and take a view of the condition of thy soul; for Christ
hath given thee light with which to do it; search carefully and
thoroughly; thy life is in it; thy soul is at stake. It is but once
to be done; if thou abuse thyself in it, the loss is irreparable; the
world is not price enough to ransom thee: wilt thou then, for such
a world, belate thyself, overstay the time of thy salvation, and lose
thy soul? Thou hast to do, I grant thee, with great patience;
but that also must have an end: therefore provoke not that God[iv]
that made thee, to reject thee. Dost thou know what it is? It is
Tophet; it is hell, the eternal anguish of the damned. Oh! Reader, as
one knowing the terrors of the Lord, I persuade thee to be serious,
diligent, and fervent about thy own salvation. Aye, and as one
knowing the comfort, peace, joy, and pleasure of the ways of
righteousness too, I exhort and invite thee to embrace the reproofs
and convictions of Christ's light and spirit in thine own conscience,
and bear the judgment, who hast wrought the sin. The fire burns
but the stubble: the wind blows but the chaff: yield up the body,
soul, and spirit to Him that maketh all things new: new heavens,
and new earth, new love, new joy, new peace, new works, a new
life and conversation. Men are grown corrupt and drossy by sin,
and they must be saved through fire, which purgeth it away: therefore
the word of God is compared to a fire, and the day of salvation
to an oven; and Christ himself to a refiner and purifier of silver.

Come, Reader, hearken to me awhile; I seek thy salvation; that
is my plot; thou wilt forgive me. A refiner is come near thee, his
grace hath appeared unto thee: it shows thee the world's lusts, and
teaches thee to deny them. Receive his leaven, and it will change
thee: his medicine, and it will cure thee: he is as infallible as free;
without money, and with certainty. A touch of his garment did it
of old: it will do it still: his virtue is the same, it cannot be exhausted:
for in him the fulness dwells; blessed be God for his sufficiency.
He laid help upon him, that he might be mighty to save
all that come to God through him: do thou so, and he will change
thee: aye, thy vile body like unto his glorious body. He is the great
philosopher indeed; the wisdom of God, that turns lead into gold,
vile things into things precious: for he maketh saints out of sinners,
and almost gods of men. What rests to us, then, that we must do,
to be thus witnesses of his power and love? This is the Crown: but
where is the Cross? Where is the bitter cup and bloody baptism?
Come, Reader, be like him; for this transcendant joy lift up thy
head above the world; then thy salvation will draw nigh indeed.

Christ's Cross is Christ's way to Christ's Crown. This is the subject
of the following Discourse; first written during my confinement in
the Tower of London, in the year 1668, now reprinted with great
enlargements of matter and testimonies, that thou, Reader, mayest[v]
be won to Christ; and if won already, brought nearer to Him. It is
a path, God, in his everlasting kindness, guided my feet into, in the
flower of my youth, when about twenty-two years of age: then He
took me by the hand, and led me out of the pleasures, vanities, and
hopes of the world. I have tasted of Christ's judgments and mercies,
and of the world's frowns and reproaches: I rejoice in my
experience, and dedicate it to thy service in Christ. It is a debt I
have long owed, and has been long expected: I have now paid it,
and delivered my soul. To my country, and to the world of Christians,
I leave it: my God, if He please, make it effectual to them all,
and turn their hearts from that envy, hatred, and bitterness, they
have one against another, about worldly things; sacrificing humanity
and charity to ambition and covetousness, for which they fill
the earth with trouble and oppression; that receiving the Spirit of
Christ into their hearts, the fruits of which are love, peace, joy, temperance,
and patience, brotherly kindness and charity, they may in
body, soul, and spirit, make a triple league against the world, the
flesh, and the devil, the common enemies of mankind; and having
conquered them through a life of self-denial, by the power of the
Cross of Jesus, they may at last attain to the eternal rest and kingdom
of God.


So desireth, so prayeth,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Friendly Reader,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

NO CROSS, NO CROWN.




PART I.




CHAPTER I.



I. Of the necessity of the Cross of Christ in general; yet the little
regard Christians have to it.&mdash;2. The degeneracy of Christendom
from purity to lust, and moderation to excess.&mdash;3. That worldly
lusts and pleasures are become the care and study of Christians,
so that they have advanced upon the impiety of infidels.&mdash;4. This
defection a second part to the Jewish tragedy, and worse than
the first: the scorn Christians have cast on their Saviour.&mdash;5. Sin
is of one nature all the world over; sinners are of the same
church, the devil's children: profession of religion in wicked
men makes them but the worse.&mdash;6. A wolf is not a lamb; a
sinner cannot be, whilst such, a saint.&mdash;7. The wicked will persecute
the good; this, false Christians have done to the true, for
non-compliance with their superstitions; the strange carnal measures
false Christians have taken of Christianity; the danger of
that self-seduction.&mdash;8. The sense of that has obliged me to make
this discourse for a dissuasive against the world's lusts, and an
invitation to take up the daily cross of Christ as the way left us
by him to blessedness.&mdash;9. Of the self-condemnation of the
wicked; that religion and worship are comprised in doing the
will of God. The advantage good men have over bad men in the
last judgment.&mdash;10. A supplication for Christendom, that she
may not be rejected in that great assize of the world. She is
exhorted to consider what relation she bears to Christ; if her
Saviour, how saved, and from what: what her experience is of
that great work. That Christ came to save from sin and wrath
by consequence; not to save men in sin, but from it, and so from
the wages of it.


I. Though the knowledge and obedience of the doctrine
of the cross of Christ be of infinite moment to the[2]
souls of men, for that is the only door to true Christianity,
and that path the ancients ever trod to blessedness; yet,
with extreme affliction let me say, it is so little understood,
so much neglected, and what is worse, so bitterly contradicted
by the vanity, superstition, and intemperance of
professed Christians, that we must either renounce to
believe what the Lord Jesus hath told us, that whosoever
doth not bear his cross, and come after him, cannot
be his disciple; (Luke, xiv. 27;) or, admitting that for
truth, conclude, that the generality of Christendom do
miserably deceive and disappoint themselves in the great
business of Christianity, and their own salvation.

II. For, let us be never so tender and charitable in the
survey of those nations that entitle themselves to any interest
in the holy name of Christ, if we will but be just too,
we must needs acknowledge, that after all the gracious
advantages of light, and obligations to fidelity, which
these latter ages of the world have received by the coming,
life, doctrine, miracles, death, resurrection, and ascension
of Christ, with the gifts of his Holy Spirit; to which add
the writings, labours, and martyrdom of his dear followers
in all times, there seems very little left of Christianity but
the name; which being now usurped by the old heathen
nature and life, makes the professors of it but true heathens
in disguise. For though they worship not the same idols,
they worship Christ with the same heart: and they can
never do otherwise, whilst they live in the same lusts. So
that the unmortified Christian and the heathen are of the
same religion. For though they have different objects to
which they do direct their prayers, that adoration in both
is but forced and ceremonious, and the deity they truly
worship is the god of the world, the great lord of lusts: to
him they bow with the whole powers of soul and sense.
What shall we eat? What shall we drink? What shall we
wear? And how shall we pass away our time? Which[3]
way may we gather wealth, increase our power, enlarge
our territories, and dignify and perpetuate our names and
families in the earth? Which base sensuality is most
pathetically expressed and comprised by the beloved
Apostle John, in these words: "The lust of the flesh, the
lust of the eyes, and the pride of life," which, says he,
"are not of the Father, but of the world, that lieth in
wickedness." (1 John, ii. 16.)

III. It is a mournful reflection, but a truth no confidence
can be great enough to deny, that these worldly
lusts fill up the study, care, and conversation of wretched
Christendom! and, which aggravates the misery, they
have grown with time. For as the world is older, it is
worse; and the examples of former lewd ages, and their
miserable conclusions, have not deterred, but excited ours;
so that the people of this seem improvers of the old stock
of impiety, and have carried it so much further than
example, that instead of advancing in virtue upon better
times, they are scandalously fallen below the life of heathens.
Their high-mindedness, lasciviousness, uncleanness,
drunkenness, swearing, lying, envy, backbiting,
cruelty, treachery, covetousness, injustice, and oppression,
are so common, and committed with such invention and
excess, that they have stumbled and embittered infidels to
a degree of scorning that holy religion, to which their good
example should have won their affections.

IV. This miserable defection from primitive times, when
the glory of Christianity was the purity of its professors, I
cannot but call the second and worst part of the Jewish
tragedy upon the blessed Saviour of mankind. For the
Jews, from the power of ignorance, and the extreme prejudice
they were under to the unworldly way of his
appearance, would not acknowledge him when he came,
but for two or three years persecuted, and finally crucified
him in one day. But the false Christians' cruelty lasts[4]
longer: they have first, with Judas, professed him, and
then, for these many ages, most basely betrayed, persecuted,
and crucified him, by a perpetual apostasy in
manners, from the self-denial and holiness of his doctrine;
their lives giving the lie to their faith. These are they
that the author of the epistle to the Hebrews tells us,
"Crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put
him to open shame:" (Heb. vi. 6:) whose defiled hearts
John in his Revelation styles, "The streets of Sodom and
Egypt, spiritually so called, where also our Lord was crucified."
(Rev. xi. 8.) And as Christ said of old, a man's
enemies are those of his own house, so Christ's enemies
now are chiefly those of his own profession; they spit
upon him, they nail and pierce him, they crown him with
thorns, and give him gall and vinegar to drink. (Matt.
xxvii. 34.) Nor is it hard to apprehend; for they that
live in the same evil nature and principle the Jews did,
that crucified him outwardly, must needs crucify him
inwardly; since they that reject the grace now in their
own hearts, are one in stock and generation with the hard-hearted
Jews, that resisted the grace that then appeared
in and by Christ.

V. Sin is of one nature all the world over; for though
a liar is not a drunkard, nor a swearer a whoremonger, nor
either properly a murderer, yet they are all of a church;
all branches of the one wicked root; all of kin. They have
but one father, the devil, as Christ said to the professing
Jews, the visible church of that age: he slighted their
claims to Abraham and Moses, and plainly told them
"That he that committed sin, was the servant of sin."
(John, viii. 34, 35.) They did the devil's works, and
therefore were the devil's children. The argument will
always hold upon the same reasons, and therefore good
still: "His servants ye are," saith Paul, "whom ye
obey:" (Rom. vi. 16:) and saith John to the church of old,[5]
"Let no man deceive you; he that committeth sin is of
the devil." (1 John, iii. 7, 8.) Was Judas ever the better
Christian for crying, Hail, Master, and kissing Christ?
By no means; they were the signal of his treachery; the
tokens given by which the bloody Jews should know and
take him. He called him Master, but betrayed him; he
kissed, but sold him to be killed; this is the upshot of the
false Christians' religion. If a man ask them, Is Christ
your Lord? they will cry, God forbid else: yes, he is our
Lord. Very well; but do you keep his commandments?
No, how should we? How then are you his disciples?
It is impossible, say they. What! would you have us
keep his commandments? No man can. What! impossible
to do that without which Christ hath made it impossible
to be a Christian? Is Christ unreasonable? Does he
reap where he has not sown? Require where he has not
enabled? Thus it is, that with Judas they call him
Master, but take part with the evil of the world to betray
him; and kiss and embrace him as far as a specious profession
goes; and then sell him, to gratify the passion
that they most indulge. Thus as God said of old, they
make him serve with their sins and for their sins too.
(Isa. xliii. 24.)

VI. Let no man deceive his own soul; "grapes are not
gathered of thorns, nor figs of thistles:" (Matt. vii. 16:)
a wolf is not a sheep, nor is a vulture a dove. What
form, people, or church soever thou art of, it is the truth
of God to mankind, that they which have even the form of
godliness, but by their unmortified lives, deny the power
thereof, make not the true, but false church: which,
though she entitle herself the Lamb's bride, or church of
Christ, (Rev. xvii. 5,) she is that mystery, or mysterious
Babylon, fitly called by the Holy Ghost, the mother of
harlots and all abominations: because degenerated from
Christian chastity and purity, into all the enormities of[6]
heathen Babylon; a sumptuous city of old time, much
noted for the seat of the kings of Babylon, and at that
time the place in the world of the greatest pride and
luxury. As she was then, so mystical Babylon is now the
great enemy of God's people.

VII. True it is, They that are born of the flesh, hate
and persecute them that are born of the spirit, who are the
circumcision in heart. It seems they cannot own nor
worship God after her inventions, methods, and prescriptions,
nor receive for doctrine her vain traditions, any
more than they can comply with her corrupt fashions and
customs in their conversation. The case being thus, from
an apostate she becomes a persecutor. It is not enough
that she herself declines from ancient purity, others must
do so too. She will give them no rest that will not partake
with her in that degeneracy, or receive her mark.
Are any wiser than she, than mother church? No, no:
nor can any make war with the beast she rides upon,
those worldly powers that protect her, and vow their
maintenance against the cries of her dissenters. Apostasy
and superstition are ever proud and impatient of dissent:
all must conform or perish. Therefore the slain witnesses,
and blood of the souls under the altar, (Rev. vi. 9,) are
found within the walls of this mystical Babylon, this great
city of false Christians, and are charged upon her, by the
Holy Ghost in the Revelation. Nor is it strange that she
should slay the servants who first crucified the Lord: but
strange and barbarous too, that she should kill her husband
and murder her Saviour; titles she seems so fond of,
and that have been so profitable to her; and that she
would recommend herself by, though without all justice.
But her children are reduced so entirely under the dominion
of darkness, by means of their continued disobedience
to the manifestation of the divine light in their souls,
that they forget what man once was, or they should now[7]
be; and know not true and pure Christianity when they
meet it; yet pride themselves upon professing it. Their
measures are so carnal and false about salvation, they call
good evil, and evil good; they make a devil a Christian,
and a saint a devil. So that though the unrighteous
latitude of their lives be matter of lamentation, as to
themselves it is of destruction; yet that common apprehension,
that they may be children of God, while in a
state of disobedience to his holy commandments; and
disciples of Jesus, though they revolt from his cross, and
members of his true church, which is without spot or
wrinkle, notwithstanding their lives are full of spots and
wrinkles; is, of all other deceptions upon themselves, the
most pernicious to their eternal condition. For they are
at peace in sin, and under a security in their transgression.
Their vain hope silences their convictions, and overlays
all tender motions to repentance; so that their mistake
about their duty to God is as mischievous as their rebellion
against him.

Thus they walk on precipices, and flatter themselves,
till the grave swallows them up, and the judgments of the
great God break their lethargy, and undeceive their poor
wretched souls with the anguish of the wicked, as the
reward of their work.

VIII. This has been, is, and will be the doom of all
worldly Christians: an end so dreadful, that if there were
nothing of duty to God, or obligation to men, being a
man, and one acquainted with the terrors of the Lord in
the way and work of my own salvation, compassion alone
were sufficient to excite me to this dissuasive against the
world's superstitions and lusts, and to invite the professors
of Christianity to the knowledge and obedience of the
daily cross of Christ, as the alone way, left by him, and
appointed us to blessedness; that they who now do but
usurp the name may have the thing; and by the power of[8]
the cross, to which they are now dead, instead of being
dead to the world by it, may be made partakers of the
resurrection that is in Christ Jesus, unto newness of life.
For they that are truly in Christ, that is, redeemed by, and
interested in him, are new creatures. (Gal. vi. 15.) They
have received a new will; such as does the will of God,
not their own. They pray in truth, and do not mock God,
when they say, Thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven. They have new affections; such as are set on
things above, (Col. iii. 1, 2, 3,) and make Christ their
eternal treasure. New faith; (1 John, 4, 5;) such as
overcomes the snares and temptations of the world's
spirit in themselves, or as it appears through others:
and lastly, new works; not of a superstitious contrivance,
or of human invention, but the pure fruits of the Spirit
of Christ working in them, as love, joy, peace, meekness,
long-suffering, temperance, brotherly-kindness, faith, patience,
gentleness, and goodness, against which there
is no law; and they that have not the Spirit of Christ,
and walk not in it, the apostle Paul has told us, are
none of his; (Rom. viii. 9;) but the wrath of God, and
condemnation of the law, will lie upon them. For if
there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ;
who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, which
is Paul's doctrine; they that walk not according to
that Holy Spirit, by his doctrine, are not in Christ:
that is, have no interest in him, nor just claim to
salvation by him: and consequently there is condemnation
to such.

IX. And the truth is, the religion of the wicked is a
lie: "there is no peace, saith the prophet, to the wicked."
(Isaiah, xlviii. 22.) Indeed there can be none; they are
reproved in their own consciences, and condemned in
their own hearts, in all their disobedience. Go where
they will, rebukes go with them, and oftentimes terrors[9]
too: for it is an offended God that pricks them, and who,
by his light, sets their sins in order before them. Sometimes
they strive to appease him by their corporeal framed
devotion and worship, but in vain; for true worshipping
of God is doing his will, which they transgress. The rest
is a false compliment, like him that said he would go, and
did not. (Matt. xxi. 30.) Sometimes they fly to sports
and company, to drown the reprover's voice, and blunt
his arrows, to chase away troubled thoughts, and secure
themselves out of the reach of the disquieter of their pleasures;
but the Almighty, first or last, is sure to overtake
them. There is no flying his final justice, for those that
reject the terms of his mercy. Impenitent rebels to his
law may then call to the mountains, and run to the caves
of the earth for protection, but in vain. His all-searching
eye will penetrate their thickest coverings, and strike up a
light in that obscurity, which shall terrify their guilty
souls; and which they shall never be able to extinguish.
Indeed, their accuser is with them, they can no more be
rid of him than of themselves; he is in the midst of
them, and will stick close to them. That spirit which
bears witness with the spirits of the just will bear witness
against theirs. Nay, their own hearts will abundantly
come in against them; and, "if our hearts condemn us,"
saith the apostle John, "God is greater, and knows all
things;" (1 John iii. 20;) that is, there is no escaping the
judgments of God, whose power is infinite, if a man is not
able to escape the condemnation of himself. It is at that
day proud and luxurious Christians shall learn that God
is no respecter of persons; that all sects and names shall
be swallowed up in these two kinds, sheep and goats, just
and unjust: and the very righteous must have a trial for
it; which made that holy man cry out, "If the righteous
scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner
appear?" (1 Pet. iv. 18.) If their thoughts, words, and[10]
works must stand the test, and come under scrutiny
before the impartial Judge of heaven and earth, how then
should the ungodly be exempted? No; we are told by
him that cannot lie, many shall then even cry, Lord,
Lord! set forth their profession, and recount the works
that they have done in his name, to make him propitious,
and yet be rejected with this direful sentence, "Depart
from me, ye workers of iniquity; I know you not." (Matt.
vii. 23.) As if he had said, Get you gone, you evil doers;
though you have professed me, I will not know you; your
vain and evil lives have made you unfit for my holy kingdom:
get you hence, and go to the gods whom you have
served; your beloved lusts which you have worshipped,
and the evil world that you have so much coveted and
adored: let them save you now, if they can, from the wrath
to come upon you, which is the wages of the deeds you have
done. Here is the end of their work that build upon the
sand; the breath of the Judge will blow it down, and
woful will the fall thereof be. Oh, it is now that the
righteous have the better of the wicked! which made an
apostate cry, in old time, "Let me die the death of the
righteous, and let my last end be like unto his." (Numb.
xxiii. 10.) For the sentence is changed, and the Judge
smiles; he casts the eye of love upon his own sheep, and
invites them with "Come, ye blessed of my Father,"
(Matt. xxv. 34,) that through patient continuance in well-doing
have long waited for immortality; you have been
the true companions of my tribulation and cross, and,
with unwearied faithfulness, in obedience to my holy will,
valiantly endured to the end, looking to me, the Author
of your precious faith, for the recompense of reward that
I have promised to them that love me, and faint not:
O, enter ye into the joy of your Lord, and inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world.

[11]

X. O Christendom! my soul most fervently prays, that
after all thy lofty profession of Christ, and his meek and
holy religion, thy unsuitable and un-Christ-like life may
not cast thee at that great assize of the world, and lose
thee so great salvation at last. Hear me once, I beseech
thee: can Christ be thy Lord, and thou not obey him?
or, canst thou be his servant, and never serve him? "Be
not deceived, such as thou sowest shalt thou reap." (Gal.
vi. 7.) He is none of thy Saviour whilst thou rejectest his
grace in thy heart, by which he should save thee. Come,
what has he saved thee from? Has he saved thee from
thy sinful lusts, thy worldly affections, and vain conversations?
If not, then he is none of thy Saviour. For,
though he be offered a Saviour to all, yet he is actually a
Saviour to those only that are saved by him; and none
are saved by him that live in those evils by which they
are lost from God, and which he came to save them
from.

It is sin that Christ is come to save man from, and death
and wrath, as the wages of it; but those that are not
saved, that is delivered, by the power of Christ in their
souls, from the power that sin has had over them, can
never be saved from the death and wrath, that are the
assured wages of the sin they live in.

So that look how far people obtain victory over those
evil dispositions and fleshly lusts, they have been addicted
to, so far they are truly saved, and are witnesses of the
redemption that comes by Jesus Christ. His name shows
his work: "And thou shalt call his name JESUS, for he
shall save his people from their sin." (Matt. i. 21.) "Behold,"
said John, of Christ, "the Lamb of God that takes
away the sins of the world." (John, i. 29.) That is, behold
him whom God hath given to enlighten people, and for
salvation to as many as receive him, and his light and[12]
grace in their hearts, and take up their daily cross and
follow him; such as rather deny themselves the pleasure
of fulfilling their lusts than sin against the knowledge he
has given them of his will, or do that they know they
ought not to do.



[13]




CHAPTER II.



1. By this Christendom may see her lapse, how foul it is, and next,
the worse for her pretence to Christianity.&mdash;2. But there is mercy
with God upon repentance, and propitiation in the blood of Jesus.&mdash;3.
He is the light of the world that reproves the darkness, that
is, the evil of the world; and he is to be known within.&mdash;4. Christendom,
like the inn of old, is full of other guests: she is advised
to believe in, receive, and apply to Christ.&mdash;5. Of the nature of
true faith; it brings power to overcome every appearance of evil:
this leads to consider the Cross of Christ, which has been so much
wanted.&mdash;6. The apostolic ministry, and end of it; its blessed
effect; the character of apostolic times.&mdash;7. The glory of the cross,
and its triumph over the heathen world. A measure to Christendom,
what she is not, and should be.&mdash;8. Her declension, and
cause of it.&mdash;9. The miserable effects that followed.&mdash;10. From
the consideration of the cause the cure may be more easily known,
viz., Not faithfully taking up the daily cross; then, faithfully
taking it daily up must be the remedy.


I. By all which has been said, O Christendom! and by
that better help, if thou wouldst use it, the lamp the Lord
has lighted in thee, not utterly extinct, it may evidently
appear, first, how great and full thy backsliding has been,
who, from the temple of the Lord, art become a cage of
unclean birds; and of a house of prayer, a den of thieves,
a synagogue of Satan, and the receptacle of every defiled
spirit. Next, that under all this manifest defection, thou
hast nevertheless valued thy corrupt self upon thy profession
of Christianity, and fearfully deluded thyself with the
hopes of salvation. The first makes thy disease dangerous,
but the last almost incurable.

II. Yet, because there is mercy with God that he may[14]
be feared, and that he takes no delight in the eternal death
of poor sinners, no, though backsliders themselves, (Ezek.
xviii. 20, 23, 24,) but is willing all should come to the
knowledge and obedience of the Truth, and be saved,
he hath set forth his Son a propitiation, and given him as
a Saviour to take away the sins of the whole world, that
those that believe and follow him may feel the righteousness
of God in the remission of their sins, and blotting
out their transgressions for ever. (Matt. i. 21; Luke i.
77; Rom. iii. 25; Heb. ix. 24 to 28; 1 John ii. 1, 2.)
Now, behold the remedy! an infallible cure, one of God's
appointing; a precious elixir, indeed, that never fails;
and that universal medicine which no malady could ever
escape.

III. But thou wilt say, What is Christ? and where is
he to be found? and how received and applied, in order
to this mighty cure? I tell thee then, first, he is the great
spiritual light of the world that enlightens every one that
comes into the world; by which he manifests to them
their deeds of darkness and wickedness, and reproves
them for committing them. Secondly, he is not far away
from thee, (Acts, xvii. 27.) as the apostle Paul said of God
to the Athenians. "Behold," says Christ himself, "I
stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice,
and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with
him, and he with me." (Rev. iii. 20.) What door can
this be but that of the heart of man?

IV. Thou, like the inn of old, hast been full of guests;
thy affections have entertained other lovers; there has
been no room for thy Saviour in thy soul. Wherefore
salvation is not yet come into thy house, though it is
come to thy door, and thou hast been often proffered it,
and hast professed it long. But if he calls, if he knocks
still, that is, if his light yet shines, if it reproves thee still,
there is hope thy day is not over, and that repentance is[15]
not yet hid from thine eyes; but his love is after thee still,
and his holy invitation continues to save thee.

Wherefore, O Christendom! believe, receive, and apply
him rightly; this is of absolute necessity, that thy soul
may live for ever with him. He told the Jews, "If you
believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins; and
whither I go ye cannot come." (John, viii. 21, 24.) And
because they believed him not, they did not receive him,
nor any benefit by him. But they that believed him
received him; and as many as received him, his own
beloved disciple tells us, "to them gave he power to
become the sons of God, which are born not of blood, nor
of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God." (John, i. 12, 13.) That is, who are not children
of God after the fashions, prescriptions, and traditions of
men, that call themselves his church and people, which is
not after the will of flesh and blood, and the invention of
carnal man, unacquainted with the regeneration and power
of the Holy Ghost, but of God; that is, according to his
will and the working and sanctification of his Spirit and
word of life in them. And such were ever well versed in
the right application of Christ, for he was made to them
indeed propitiation, reconciliation, salvation, righteousness,
redemption, and justification.

So I say to thee, unless thou believest that he that
stands at the door of thy heart and knocks, and sets thy
sins in order before thee, and calls thee to repentance, be
the Saviour of the world, thou wilt die in thy sins, and
where he is gone thou wilt never come. For, if thou
believest not in him, it is impossible that he should do
thee good, or effect thy salvation: Christ works not
against faith, but by it. It is said of old, "He did not
many mighty works in some places, because the people
believed not in him." (John, i. 12, 13.) So that, if thou
truly believest in him, thine ear will be attentive to his[16]
voice in thee, and the door of thine heart open to his
knocks. Thou wilt yield to the discoveries of his light,
and the teachings of his grace will be very dear to thee.

V. It is the nature of true faith to beget a holy fear of
offending God, a deep reverence to his precepts, and a
most tender regard to the inward testimony of his Spirit,
as that by which his children in all ages have been safely
led to glory. For, as they that truly believe receive Christ
in all his tenders to the soul, so as true it is that those who
receive him thus, with him receive power to become the
sons of God: that is, an inward force and ability to do
whatever he requires; strength to mortify their lusts, controul
their affections, resist evil motions, deny themselves,
and overcome the world in its most enticing appearances.
This is the life of the blessed Cross of Christ, which is the
subject of the following discourse, and what thou, O man,
must take up, if thou intendest to be the disciple of Jesus.
Nor canst thou be said to receive Christ, or to believe in
him, whilst thou rejectest his cross. For, as receiving of
Christ is the means appointed of God to salvation, so
bearing the daily cross after him is the only true testimony
of receiving him, and therefore it is enjoined by him as
the great token of discipleship, "If any man will come
after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
follow me." (Matt. xvi. 24.)

This, Christendom, is that thou hast so much wanted,
and the want of which has proved the only cause of thy
miserable declension from pure Christianity. To consider
which well, as it is thy duty, so it is of great use to thy
restoration.

For as the knowledge of the cause of any distemper
guides the physician to make a right and safe judgment
in the application of his medicine, so it will much enlighten
thee in the way of thy recovery, to know and
weigh the first cause of this spiritual lapse and malady[17]
that has befallen thee. To do which, a general view of
thy primitive estate, and consequently of their work that
first laboured in the Christian vineyard, will be needful;
and if therein something be repeated, the weight and
dignity of the subject will bear it, without the need of an
apology.

VI. The work of apostleship, we are told by a prime
labourer in it, was to turn people "from darkness to light,
and from the power of Satan unto God." (Acts, xxvi. 18.)
That is, instead of yielding to the temptations and motions
of Satan, who is the prince of darkness or wickedness, the
one being a metaphor to the other, by whose power their
understandings were obscured, and their souls held in the
service of sin, they should turn their minds to the appearance
of Christ, the Light and Saviour of the world; who
by his light shines in their souls, and thereby gives them
a sight of their sins, and discovers every temptation and
motion in them unto evil, and reproves them when they
give way thereunto; that so they might become the children
of light, and walk in the path of righteousness. And for
this blessed work of reformation did Christ endue his
apostles with his spirit and power, that so men might not
longer sleep in a security of sin and ignorance of God,
but awake to righteousness, that the Lord Jesus might
give them life; that is, that they might leave off sinning,
deny themselves the pleasure of wickedness, and, by true
repentance, turn their hearts to God in well doing, in
which is peace. And truly God so blessed the faithful
labours of these poor mechanics, yet his great ambassadors
to mankind, that in a few years many thousands that
had lived without God in the world, without a sense or
fear of him, lawlessly, very strangers to the work of his
Spirit in their hearts, being captivated by fleshly lusts,
were inwardly struck and quickened by the word of life,
and made sensible of the coming and power of the Lord[18]
Jesus Christ as a judge and lawgiver in their souls, by
whose holy light and spirit the hidden things of darkness
were brought to light and condemned, and pure repentance
from those dead works begotten in them, that they
might serve the living God in newness of spirit. So that
thenceforward they lived not to themselves, neither were
they carried away of those former divers lusts, by which
they had been seduced from the true fear of God; but
"the law of the spirit of life," (Rom. viii. 2,) by which
they overcame the law of sin and death, was their delight,
and therein did they meditate day and night. Their
regard towards God was not taught by the precepts of
men any longer, (Isaiah, xxix. 13,) but from the knowledge
they had received by his own work and impressions
in their souls. They had quitted their old masters, the
world, the flesh, and the devil, and delivered up themselves
to the holy guidance of the grace of Christ, that
taught them to "deny ungodliness and the world's lusts,
and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present
life:" (Tit. ii. 11, 12:) this is the cross of Christ indeed,
and here is the victory it gives to them that take it up;
by this cross they died daily to the old life they had lived,
and by holy watchfulness against the secret motions of
evil in their hearts they crushed sin in its conceptions, yea
in its temptations. So that they, as the apostle John
advised them, "kept themselves, that the evil one touched
them not." (1 John, v. 18.)

For the light, which Satan cannot endure, and with
which Christ had enlightened them, discovered him in all
his approaches and assaults upon the mind; and the
power they received through their inward obedience to
the manifestations of that blessed light, enabled them to
resist and vanquish him in all his stratagems. And thus
it was that, where once nothing was examined, nothing
went unexamined; every thought must come to judgment,[19]
and the rise and tendency of it be also well approved, before
they allowed it any room in their minds. There was
no fear of entertaining enemies for friends, whilst this
strict guard was kept upon the very wicket of the soul.
Now the old heavens and earth, that is, the old earthly
conversation, and old carnal, that is Jewish or shadowy
worship, passed away apace, and every day all things
became new. He was no more a Jew that was one outwardly,
nor that circumcision that was in the flesh; but
he was the Jew that was one inwardly, and that circumcision
which was of the heart, in the Spirit, and not in the
letter, whose praise is not of man, but of God. (Rom. ii.
28, 29.)

VII. Indeed, the glory of the cross shined so conspicuously
through the self-denial of their lives who daily
bore it, that it struck the heathen with astonishment; and
in a small time so shook their altars, discredited their
oracles, struck the multitude, invaded the court, and overcame
their armies, that it led priests, magistrates, and
generals in triumph after it, as the trophies of its power
and victory.

And, while this integrity dwelt with Christians, mighty
was the presence, and invincible that power that attended
them; it quenched fire, daunted lions, turned the edge of
the sword, outfaced instruments of cruelty, convicted
judges, and converted executioners. (Heb. xi. 32, to the
end; Isaiah, xliii. 2; Daniel, iii. 12, to the end.) In fine,
the way their enemies took to destroy, increased them;
and, by the deep wisdom of God, they who in all their
designs endeavoured to extinguish the truth were made
great promoters of it. (Dan. vi. 16, to the end.) Now,
not a vain thought, not an idle word, not an unseemly
action was permitted; no, not an immodest look, no
courtly dress, gay apparel, complimental respects, or personal
honours: much less those lewd immoralities and[20]
scandalous vices, now in vogue with Christians, could find
either example or connivance among them. Their care
was not how to sport away their precious time, but how to
redeem it, (Eph. v. 15, 16,) that they might have enough
to work out their great salvation, which they carefully did,
with fear and trembling: not with balls and masks, with
playhouses, dancing, feasting, and gaming; no, no; to
make sure of their heavenly calling and election was much
dearer to them than the poor and trifling joys of mortality.
For they having, with Moses, seen him that is invisible,
and found that his loving-kindness was better than life,
the peace of his Spirit than the favour of princes,&mdash;as
they feared not Cæsar's wrath,&mdash;so they chose rather to
sustain the afflictions of Christ's true pilgrims than enjoy
the pleasures of sin that were but for a season; esteeming
his reproaches of more value than the perishing treasures
of the earth. And if the tribulations of Christianity were
more eligible than the comforts of the world, and the
reproaches of one than all the honour of the other, there
was then surely no temptations in it that could shake
the integrity of Christendom.

VIII. By this short draught of what Christendom was,
thou mayest see, O Christendom, what thou are not, and
consequently what thou oughtest to be. But how comes
it that from a Christendom that was thus meek, merciful,
self-denying, suffering, temperate, holy, just, and good,
so like to Christ, whose name she bore, we find a Christendom
now that is superstitious, idolatrous, persecuting,
proud, passionate, envious, malicious, selfish, drunken,
lascivious, unclean, lying, swearing, cursing, covetous,
oppressing, defrauding, with all other abominations known
in the earth?

I lay this down as the undoubted reason of this degeneracy,
to wit, the inward disregard of thy mind to the
light of Christ shining in thee, that first showed thee thy[21]
sins and reproved them, and that taught and enabled thee
to deny and resist them. For as thy fear towards God,
and holy abstinence from unrighteousness, was, at first,
not taught by the precepts of men, but by that light and
grace which revealed the most secret thoughts and purposes
of thine heart, and searched the most inward parts,
setting thy sins in order before thee, and reproving thee
for them, not suffering one unfruitful thought, word, or
work of darkness to go unjudged; so when thou didst
begin to disregard that light and grace, to be careless of
that holy watch that was once set up in thine heart, and
didst not keep sentinel there, as formerly, for God's glory
and thy own peace, the restless enemy of man's good
quickly took advantage of this slackness, and often surprised
thee with temptations, whose suitableness to thy
inclinations made his conquest over thee not difficult.

In short, thou didst omit to take up Christ's holy yoke,
to bear thy daily cross; thou wast careless of thy affections,
and kept no journal or check upon thy actions; but
didst decline to audit accounts in thy own conscience,
with Christ thy light, the great Bishop of thy soul and
Judge of thy works, whereby the holy fear decayed and
love waxed cold, vanity abounded, and duty became burdensome.
Then up came formality, instead of the power
of godliness; superstition, in place of Christ's institution:
and whereas Christ's business was to draw on the minds
of his disciples from an outward temple, and carnal rites
and services, to the inward and spiritual worship of God,
suitable to the nature of divinity, a worldly, human,
pompous worship is brought in again, and a worldly
priesthood, temple, and altar, are re-established. Now
it was that the sons of God once more saw the daughters
of men were fair, (Gen. vi. 2,) that is, the pure eye grew
dim, which repentance had opened, that saw no comeliness
out of Christ, and the eye of lust became unclosed[22]
again by the god of the world; and those worldly
pleasures that make such as love them forget God, though
once despised for the sake of Christ, began now to recover
their old beauty and interest in thy affections, and from
liking them, to be the study, care, and pleasure of thy
life.

True, there still remained the exterior forms of worship
and a nominal and oral reverence to God and Christ, but
that was all; for the offence of the holy cross ceased,
the power of godliness was denied, self-denial lost, and,
though fruitful in the invention of ceremonious ornaments,
yet barren in the blessed fruits of the Spirit. And
a thousand shells cannot make one kernel, or many dead
corpses one living man.

IX. Thus religion fell from experience to tradition, and
worship from power to form, from life to letter; and, instead
of putting up lively and powerful requests, animated
by a deep sense of want and the assistance of the Holy
Spirit,&mdash;by which the ancients prayed, wrestled, and prevailed
with God,&mdash;behold a by-rote mumpsimus, a dull
and insipid formality, made up of corporeal bowings and
cringings, garments and furnitures, perfumes, voices, and
music, fitter for the reception of some earthly prince than
the heavenly worship of the one true and immortal God,
who is an eternal, invisible Spirit.

But thy heart growing carnal, thy religion did so too;
and, not liking it as it was, thou fashionedst it to thy
liking: forgetting what the holy prophet said, "The
sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,"
(Prov. xv. 8,) and what St. James saith, "Ye ask, and
receive not." (James, iv. 3.) Why? "Because ye ask
amiss;" that is, with a heart that is not right, but insincere,
unmortified, not in the faith that purifies the soul,
and therefore can never receive what is asked: so that
a man may say with truth, thy condition is worse by thy[23]
religion, because thou art tempted to think thyself better
for it, and art not.

X. Well; by this prospect that is given thee of thy
foul fall from primitive Christianity, and the true cause of
it,&mdash;to wit, a neglect of the daily cross of Christ,&mdash;it may
be easy for thee to inform thyself of the way of thy
recovery.

For, look, at what door thou wentest out, at that door
thou must come in; and, as letting fall and forbearing the
daily cross lost thee, so taking up and enduring the daily
cross must recover thee. It is the same way by which
the sinners and apostates become the disciples of Jesus.
"Whosoever," says Christ, "will come after me and be
my disciple, let him deny himself, and take up his daily
cross and follow me." (Matthew, xvi. 24; Mark, viii.
34; Luke, xiv. 27.) Nothing short of this will do; mark
that! for, as it is sufficient, so it is indispensable; no
crown but by the cross, no life eternal but through death;
and it is but just that those evil and barbarous affections
that crucified Christ afresh, should, by his holy cross, be
crucified.



[24]




CHAPTER III.



1. What the cross of Christ is. A figurative speech, but truly the
Divine power that mortifies the world.&mdash;2. It is so called by the
apostle Paul to the Corinthians.&mdash;3. Where it is the cross appears,
and must be borne? Within; where the lusts are, there
they must be crucified.&mdash;4. Experience teaches every one this;
to be sure Christ asserts it, from within comes murder, &amp;c., and
that is the house where the strong man must be bound.&mdash;5. How
is the cross to be borne? The way is spiritual, a denial of self,
of the pleasure of sin; to please God, and obey his will as manifested
to the soul by the light He gives it.&mdash;6. This shows the
difficulty, yet the necessity of the cross.


The daily cross being then, and still, O Christendom! the
way to glory, that the succeeding matter, which wholly
relates to the doctrine of it, may come with most evidence
and advantage upon thy conscience it is most seriously to
be considered by thee,&mdash;

First, What the cross of Christ is?

Secondly, Where the cross of Christ is to be taken
up?

Thirdly, How, and after what manner it is to be
borne?

Fourthly, What is the great work and business of the
cross? In which, the sins it crucifies, with the mischiefs
that attend them, will be at large expressed.

Fifthly and lastly, I shall add many testimonies from
living and dying persons of great reputation, either for
their quality, learning, or piety, as a general confirmation
of the whole tract.

[25]

To the first, What is the cross of Christ?

I. The cross of Christ is a figurative speech, borrowed
from the outward tree, or wooden cross, on which Christ
submitted to the will of God, suffering death at the hands
of evil men. So that the cross mystical is that Divine
grace and power which crosseth the carnal wills of men,
and gives a contradiction to their corrupt affections, and
that constantly opposeth itself to the inordinate and
fleshly appetite of their minds, and so may be justly
termed the instrument of man's wholly dying to the world,
and being made conformable to the will of God. For
nothing else can mortify sin, or make it easy for us to
submit to the Divine will in things otherwise very contrary
to their own.

II. The preaching of the cross, therefore, in primitive
times was fitly called by Paul, that famous and skilful
apostle in spiritual things, "the power of God," though to
them that perish, then, as now, "foolishness." That is,
to those that were truly weary and heavy laden, and
needed a deliverer, to whom sin was burdensome and
odious, the preaching of the cross, by which sin was to
be mortified, was, as to them, the power of God, or a
preaching of the Divine power by which they were made
disciples of Christ and children of God; and it wrought
so powerfully upon them that no proud nor licentious
mockers could put them out of love with it. But to those
that walked in the broad way, in the full latitude of their
lusts, and dedicated their time and care to the pleasure of
their corrupt appetites, to whom all yoke and bridle were
and are intolerable, the preaching of the cross was and is
foolishness.

III. Well: but then where does this cross appear, and
where must it be taken up?

I answer, within: that is, in the heart and soul; for
where the sin is, the cross must be. Now all evil comes[26]
from within: this Christ taught: "From within," saith
Christ, "out of the heart of man proceed evil thoughts,
adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness,
wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy,
pride, foolishness: all these evils come from within, and
defile the man." (Mark, vii. 21, 22, 23.)

The heart of man is the seat of sin, and where he is
defiled he must be sanctified; and where sin lives, there
it must die: it must be crucified. Custom in evil hath
made it natural to men to do evil; and as the soul rules
the body, so the corrupt nature sways the whole man:
but still, it is all from within.

IV. Experience teaches every son and daughter of
Adam to assent to this; for the enemy's temptations are
ever directed to the mind, which is within: if they take
not, the soul sins not; if they are embraced, lust is presently
conceived, that is, inordinate desires; lust conceived,
brings forth sin; and sin finished, that is, acted,
brings forth death. (James, v. 15.) Here is both the
cause and the effect, the very genealogy of sin, its rise
and end.

In all this, the heart of evil man is the devil's mint, his
work-house, the place of his residence, where he exercises
his power and art. And therefore the redemption of the
soul is aptly called the destruction of the works of the
devil, and bringing in of everlasting righteousness.
(1 John, iii. 8.; Dan. ix. 24.) When the Jews would
have defamed Christ's miracle of casting out devils, by a
blasphemous imputation of it to the power of Beelzebub,
he says that "no man can enter into a strong man's house,
and spoil his goods, till he first bind the strong man."
(Matt. xii. 29.) Which, as it shows the contrariety that
was between Beelzebub and the power by which he dispossessed
him, so it teaches us to know that the souls of
the wicked are the devil's house, and that his goods, his[27]
evil works, can never be destroyed till first he that
wrought them, and keeps the house, be bound. All
which makes it easy to know where the cross must be
taken up, by which alone the strong man must be bound,
his goods spoiled, and his temptations resisted, that is,
within, in the heart of man.

V. But in the next place, how and in what manner is
the cross to be daily borne?

The way, like the cross, is spiritual: that is an inward
submission of the soul to the will of God, as it is manifested
by the light of Christ in the consciences of men,
though it be contrary to their own inclinations. For
example: when evil presents, that which shows the evil
does also tell them they should not yield to it; and if
they close with its counsel, it gives them power to escape
it. But they that look and gaze upon the temptation, at
last fall in with it, and are overcome by it; the consequence
of which is guilt and judgment. Therefore, as
the cross of Christ is that spirit and power in men, though
not of men, but of God, which crosseth and reproveth
their fleshly lusts and affections; so the way of taking up
the cross is an entire resignation of soul to the discoveries
and requirings of it: not to consult their worldly pleasure,
or carnal ease, or interest, for such are captivated in a
moment, but continually to watch against the very appearances
of evil, and by the obedience of faith, that is, of
true love to, and confidence in God, cheerfully to offer up
to the death of the cross, that evil part, that Judas in
themselves, which, not enduring the heat of the siege, and
being impatient in the hour of temptation, would, by its
near relation to the tempter, more easily betray their souls
into his hands.

VI. O this shows to every one's experience how hard it
is to be a true disciple of Jesus! the way is narrow
indeed, and the gate very strait, where not a word, no not[28]
a thought must slip the watch, or escape judgment; such
circumspection, such caution, such patience, such constancy,
such holy fear and trembling. This gives an easy
interpretation to that hard saying, "Flesh and blood
cannot inherit the kingdom of God;" (Matt. xxiv. 42;
xxv. 13; xxvi. 38, 42;) those that are captivated with
fleshly lusts and affections: for they cannot bear the
cross; and they that cannot endure the cross must never
have the crown. To reign, it is necessary first to suffer.
(Phil. ii. 12; 1 Cor. xv. 50.)

CHAPTER IV.



1. What is the great work of the cross? The answer to this is of
great moment.&mdash;2. The work of the cross is self-denial.&mdash;3. What
was the cup and cross of Christ?&mdash;4. What is our cup and cross?&mdash;5.
Our duty is to follow Christ as our captain.&mdash;6. Of the distinction
in self, a lawful and unlawful self.&mdash;7. What the lawful
self is.&mdash;8. That it is to be denied in some cases by Christ's doctrine
and example.&mdash;9. By the Apostle's pattern.&mdash;10. The danger
of preferring lawful self above our duty to God.&mdash;11. The reward
of self-denial an excitement to it.&mdash;12. This doctrine as old as
Abraham.&mdash;13. His obedience of faith memorable.&mdash;14. Job a
great instance of self-denial, his contentment.&mdash;15. Moses also a
mighty example, his neglect of Pharaoh's court.&mdash;16. His choice.&mdash;17.
The reason of it, viz. the recompense of reward.&mdash;18. Isaiah
no inconsiderable instance, who of a courtier, became a holy
prophet.&mdash;19. These instances concluded with that of holy Daniel,
his patience and integrity, and the success they had upon the
king.&mdash;20. There might be many mentioned to confirm this
blessed doctrine.&mdash;21. All must be left for Christ, as men would
be saved.&mdash;22. The way of God is a way of faith and self-denial.&mdash;23.
An earnest supplication and exhortation to all, to attend
upon these things.


But fourthly, What is the great work and business of the
cross respecting man?

Answ. I. This indeed is of that mighty moment to be
truly, plainly, and thoroughly answered, that all that went
before seems only to serve for preface to it; and miscarrying
in it to be no less than a misguidance of the soul
about its way to blessedness. I shall therefore pursue the
question, with God's help, and the best knowledge He
hath given me in the experience of several years' discipleship.

[30]

II. The great work and business of the cross of Christ
in man is self-denial; a word of as much depth in itself
as of sore contradiction to the world, little understood
but less embraced by it, yet it must be borne for all that.
The Son of God is gone before us, and, by the bitter cup
He drank and the baptism He suffered, has left us an example
that we should follow in his steps; which made
him put that hard question to the wife of Zebedee and
her two sons, upon her soliciting that one might sit at his
right and the other at his left hand in his kingdom, "Are
ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to
be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?" It
seems their faith was strong; they answered, "We are
able." Upon which he replied, "Ye shall drink indeed
of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized
with;" but their reward he left to his Father.
(Matt. xx. 21, 22, 23.)

III. What was his cup he drank, and baptism he
suffered? I answer, they were the denial and offering
up of himself by the eternal Spirit to the will of God,
undergoing the tribulations of his life and agonies of his
death upon the cross for man's salvation.

IV. What is our cup and cross that we should drink
and suffer? They are the denial and offering up of ourselves,
by the same Spirit, to do or suffer the will of
God for his service and glory, which is the true life and
obedience of the cross of Jesus; narrow still, but before
an unbeaten way. For when there was none to help, not
one to open the seals, to give knowledge, to direct the
course of poor man's recovery, He came in the greatness
of his love and strength; and though clothed with the
infirmities of a mortal man, being within fortified with
the almightiness of an immortal God, He travelled through
all the straits and difficulties of humanity, and first, of all
others, trod the untrodden path to blessedness.

[31]

V. O come! let us follow Him, the most unwearied, the
most victorious captain of our salvation; to whom all the
great Alexanders and mighty Cæsars of the world are less
than the poorest soldier of their camps could be to them.
True, they were all great princes of their kind, and conquerors
too, but on very different principles. For Christ
made himself of no reputation, to save mankind; but these
plentifully ruined people to augment theirs. They vanquished
others, not themselves; Christ conquered self,
that ever vanquished them; of merit therefore the most
excellent Prince and Conqueror. Besides, they advanced
their empire by rapine and blood, but He by suffering and
persuasion; He never by compulsion, they always by force
prevailed. Misery and slavery followed all their victories,
his brought greater freedom and felicity to those he overcame.
In all they did they sought to please themselves;
in all He did he aimed to please his Father, who is King
of kings and Lord of lords.

It is this most perfect pattern of self-denial we must
follow, if ever we will come to glory; to do which let us
consider self-denial in its true distinction and extent.

VI. There is a lawful and unlawful self: and both must
be denied for the sake of him, who in submission to the
will of God counted nothing dear that he might save us.
And, though the world be scarcely in any part of it at
that pass as yet to need that lesson of the denial of lawful
self, that every day most greedily sacrifices to the pleasure
of unlawful self; yet to take the whole thing before me,
and for that it may possibly meet with some that are so
far advanced in this spiritual warfare as to receive some
service from it, I shall at least touch upon it.

VII. The lawful self which we are to deny, is that conveniency,
ease, enjoyment, and plenty, which in themselves
are so far from being evil, that they are the bounty
and blessings of God to us, as husband, wife, child, house,[32]
land, reputation, liberty, and life itself; these are God's
favours, which we may enjoy with lawful pleasure and
justly improve as our honest interest. But when God
requires them, at what time soever the lender calls for
them or is pleased to try our affections by our parting
with them; I say, when they are brought in competition
with him, they must not be preferred, they must be
denied. Christ himself descended from the glory of his
Father, and willingly made himself of no reputation
among men, that he might make us of some with God;
and, from the quality of thinking it no robbery to be equal
with God, he humbled himself to the poor form of a servant;
yea, the ignominious death of the cross. (Phil. ii.
5, 6, 7, 8.)

VIII. It is the doctrine he teaches us in these words,
"He that loveth father or mother, son or daughter, more
than me, is not worthy of me." (Matt. x. 37.) Again,
"Whoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he
hath, cannot be my disciple." (Luke, xiv. 33.) And he
plainly told the young rich man that if he would have
eternal life, he should sell all and follow him; (Mark,
x. 21, 22;) a doctrine sad to him as it is to those that,
like him, for all their high pretences to religion, in truth
love their possessions more than Christ. This doctrine
of self-denial is the condition to eternal happiness, "He
that will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up
his cross and follow me." (Matt. xvi. 24.)

IX. This made those honest fishermen quit their lawful
trades and follow him, when he called them to it, and
others that waited for the consolation of Israel to offer up
their estates, reputations, liberties, and also lives, to the
displeasure and fury of their kindred and the government
they lived under for the spiritual advantage that accrued
to them by their faithful adherence to his holy doctrine.
True, many would have excused their following him in[33]
the parable of the feast: some had bought land, some had
married wives, and others had bought yokes of oxen, and
could not come; (Luke, xiv. 18, 19, 20;) that is, an
immoderate love of the world hindered them: their lawful
enjoyments, from servants became their idols; they worshipped
them more than God, and would not quit them to
come to God. But this is recorded to their reproach; and
we may herein see the power of self upon the worldly
man, and the danger that comes to him by the abuse of
lawful things. What, thy wife dearer to thee than thy
Saviour! and thy land and oxen preferred before thy soul's
salvation! O beware, that thy comforts prove not snares
first, and then curses: to overrate them, is to provoke him
that gave them to take them away again: come, and follow
him that giveth life eternal to the soul.

X. Woe to them that have their hearts in their earthly
possessions! for when they are gone, their heaven is gone
with them. It is too much the sin of the greatest part of
the world, that they stick in the comforts of it. And it is
lamentable to behold how their affections are bemired and
entangled with their conveniencies and accommodations
in it. The true self-denying man is a pilgrim; but the
selfish man is an inhabitant of the world: the one uses it,
as men do ships, to transport themselves or tackle in a
journey, that is, to get home; the other looks no further,
whatever he prates, than to be fixed in fulness and ease
here, and likes it so well, that if he could, he would not
exchange. However, he will not trouble himself to think
of the other world, till he is sure he must live no longer
in this: but then, alas! it may prove too late; not
to Abraham, but to Dives he may go; the story is as
true as sad.

XI. But on the other hand, it is not for nought that
the disciples of Jesus deny themselves; and indeed,
Christ himself had the eternal joy in his eye: "For the[34]
joy that was set before him," says the author to the
Hebrews, "he endured the cross;" (Heb. xii. 2;) that is,
he denied himself, and bore the reproaches and death of
the wicked; and despised the shame, to wit, the dishonour
and derision of the world. It made him not afraid
nor shrink, he contemned it; and is set down at the right
hand of the throne of God. And to their encouragement,
and great consolation, when Peter asked him, what they
should have that had forsaken all to follow him, he
answered them, "Verily I say unto you, that ye, which
have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of
Man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit
upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel,"
(Matt. xix. 27-29,) that were then in an apostacy from
the life and power of godliness. This was the lot of his
disciples; the more immediate companions of his tribulations,
and first messengers of his kingdom. But the next
that follows is to all: and "every one that hath forsaken
houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or
wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall
receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life."
It was this recompense of reward, this eternal crown of
righteousness, that in every age has raised, in the souls of
the just, a holy neglect, yea, contempt of the world. To
this is owing the constancy of the martyrs, as to their
blood, the triumph of the Truth.

XII. Nor is this a new doctrine; it is as old as Abraham.
(Gen. xii.) In several most remarkable instances,
his life was made up of self-denial. First, in quitting his
own land, where we may well suppose him settled in the
midst of plenty, at least sufficiency: and why? Because
God called him. Indeed this should be reason enough,
but such is the world's degeneracy that in fact it is not:
and the same act, upon the same inducement, in any now,
though praised in Abraham, would be derided. So apt[35]
are people not to understand what they commend; nay,
to despise those actions, when they meet them in the
people of their own times, which they pretend to admire
in their ancestors.

XIII. But he obeyed: the consequence was, that God
gave him a mighty land. This was the first reward of his
obedience. The next was, a son in his old age; and
which greatened the blessing, after it had been, in nature,
past the time of his wife's bearing of children. (Gen.
xxii. 2.) Yet God called for his darling, their only child,
the joy of their age, the son of a miracle, and he upon
whom the fulfilling of the promise made to Abraham did
depend. For this son, I say, God called: a mighty trial:
that which, one would have thought, might very well have
overturned his faith, and stumbled his integrity; at least
have put him upon this dispute in himself. This command
is unreasonable and cruel; it is the tempter's, it
cannot be God's. For, is it to be thought that God gave
me a son to make a sacrifice of him? that the father
should be butcher of his only child? Again, that he
should require me to offer up the son of his own promise,
by whom his covenant is to be performed; this is incredible.
I say, thus Abraham might naturally enough have
argued, to withstand the voice of God, and indulge his
great affections to his beloved Isaac. But good old Abraham,
that knew the voice that had promised him a son,
had not forgotten to know it, when it required him back
again; he disputes not, though it looked strange, and
perhaps with some surprise and horror, as a man. He
had learned to believe that God, that gave him a child by
a miracle, could work another to preserve or restore him.
His affections could not balance his duty, much less
overcome his faith; for he received him in a way that
would let him doubt of nothing that God had promised to
him.

[36]

To the voice of this Almightiness he bows, builds an
altar, binds his only son upon it, kindles the fire, and
stretches forth his hand to take the knife: but the angel
stopped the stroke: Hold, Abraham, thy integrity is
proved. What followed? a ram served, and Isaac was
his again. This shows how little serves, where all is
resigned, and how mean a sacrifice contents the Almighty,
where the heart is approved. So that it is not the sacrifice
that recommends the heart, but the heart that gives
the sacrifice acceptance.

God often touches our best comforts, and calls for that
which we most love, and are least willing to part with.
Not that he always takes it utterly away, but to prove the
soul's integrity, to caution us from excesses, and that we
may remember God, the author of those blessings we
possess, and live loose to them. I speak my experience;
the way to keep our enjoyments is to resign them; and
though that be hard, it is sweet to see them returned, as
Isaac was to his father Abraham, with more love and
blessing than before. O stupid world! O worldly Christians;
not only strangers, but enemies to this excellent
faith! and whilst so, the rewards of it you can never
know.

XIV. But Job presses hard upon Abraham: his self-denial
also was very signal. For when the messengers of
his afflictions came thick upon him, one doleful story after
another, till he was left almost as naked as when he was
born; the first thing he did, he fell to the ground, and
worshipped that power, and kissed that hand that stripped
him; so far from murmuring, that he concludes his losses
of estate and children with these words: "Naked came I
out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return: the
Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the
name of the Lord." (Job, i. 21.) O the deep faith,
patience, and contentment of this excellent man! one[37]
would have thought this repeated news of ruin had been
enough to have overset his confidence in God; but it did
not; that stayed him. But indeed he tells us why; his
Redeemer lived; "I know," says he, "that my Redeemer
lives." (Job, xix. 25, 26.) And it appeared he did; for
he had redeemed him from the world: his heart was not
in his worldly comforts: his hope lived above the joys of
time and troubles of mortality; not tempted by the one,
nor shaken by the other; but firmly believed, that when
after his skin worms should have consumed his body, yet
with his eyes he should see his God. Thus was the
heart of Job both submitted to and comforted in the will
of God.

XV. Moses is the next great example in sacred story
for remarkable self-denial, before the times of Christ's
appearance in the flesh. He had been saved when an
infant, by an extraordinary providence, and it seems, by
what followed, for an extraordinary service: Pharaoh's
daughter, whose compassion was the means of his preservation,
when the king decreed the slaughter of the Hebrew
males, (Exod. ii. 1, 10,) took him for her son, and
gave him the education of her father's court. His own
graceful presence and extraordinary abilities, joined with
her love for him, and interest in her father to promote
him, must have rendered him, if not capable of succession,
at least of being chief minister of affairs under that
wealthy and powerful prince. For Egypt was then what
Athens and Rome were after, the most famous for learning,
art, and glory.

XVI. But Moses, ordained for other work and guided
by a higher principle, no sooner came to years of discretion,
than the impiety of Egypt, and the oppressions of
his brethren there, grew a burden too heavy for him to
bear. And though so wise and good a man could not
want those generous and grateful acknowledgments, that[38]
became the kindness of the king's daughter to him; yet
he had also seen that God that was invisible; (Heb. xi.
24-27;) and did not dare to live in the ease and plenty
of Pharaoh's house, whilst his poor brethren were required
to make brick without straw. (Exod. v. 7, 16.)

Thus the fear of the Almighty taking deep hold of his
heart, he nobly refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's
daughter, and chose rather a life of affliction, with the
most despised and oppressed Israelites, and to be the
companion of their tribulations and jeopardies, than to
enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the
reproaches of Christ, which he suffered for making that
unworldly choice, greater riches than all the treasures of
that kingdom.

XVII. Nor was he so foolish as they thought him; he
had reason on his side; for it is said, he had an eye to
the recompense of reward, he did but refuse a lesser
benefit for a greater. In this his wisdom transcended
that of the Egyptians; for they made the present world
their choice, as uncertain as the weather, and so lost that
which has no end. Moses looked deeper, and weighed
the enjoyments of this life in the scales of eternity, and
found they made no weight there. He governed himself
not by the immediate possession, but the nature and duration
of the reward. His faith corrected his affections,
and taught him to sacrifice the pleasure of self, to the
hope he had of a future more excellent recompense.

XVIII. Isaiah[1] was no inconsiderable instance of this
blessed self-denial; who of a courtier became a prophet,
and left the worldly interests of the one, for the faith,
patience, and sufferings of the other. For his choice did
not only lose him the favour of men, but their wickedness,
enraged at his integrity to God, in his fervent and bold
reproofs of them, made a martyr of him in the end, for[39]
they barbarously sawed him asunder in the reign of king
Manasseh. Thus died that excellent man, and commonly
called the Evangelical Prophet.

XIX. I shall add, of many, one example more, and that
is from the fidelity of Daniel; a holy and wise young man,
who when his external advantages came in competition
with his duty to Almighty God, relinquished them all;
and instead of being solicitous how to secure himself, as
one minding nothing less, he was, to the utmost hazard of
himself, most careful how to preserve the honour of God,
by his fidelity to his will. And though at the first it
exposed him to ruin, yet, as an instance of great encouragement
to all that like him will choose to keep a good
conscience in an evil time, at last it advanced him greatly
in the world; and the God of Daniel was made famous
and terrible through his perseverance even in the eyes of
heathen kings.

XX. What shall I say of all the rest, who counted
nothing dear that they might do the will of God, abandoned
their worldly comforts, and exposed their ease and
safety, as often as the heavenly vision called them,[2] to the
wrath and malice of degenerate princes and an apostate
church? More especially Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Micah,
who after they had denied themselves, in obedience to the
divine voice, sealed their testimony with their blood.

Thus was self-denial the practice and glory of the
ancients, that were predecessors to the coming of Christ
in the flesh: and shall we hope to go to heaven without
it now, when our Saviour himself is become the most
excellent example of it? and that not as some would fain
have it, viz. for us, that we need not; (1 Peter, ii. 21;)
but for us, that we might deny ourselves, and so be the
true followers of his blessed example.

XXI. Whoever therefore thou art that wouldst do the[40]
will of God, but faintest in thy desires, from the opposition
of worldly considerations, remember I tell thee, in
the name of Christ, that he that prefers father or mother,
sister or brother, wife or child, house or land, reputation,
honour, office, liberty, or life, before the testimony of the
light of Jesus, in his own conscience, shall be rejected of
him in the solemn and general inquest upon the world,
when all shall be judged, and receive according to the
deeds done, not the profession made, in this life. It was
the doctrine of Jesus, that if thy right hand offend thee,
thou must cut it off; and if thy right eye offend thee, thou
must pluck it out: (Matt. v. 29, 30:) that is, if the most
dear, the most useful and tender comforts thou enjoyest,
stand in thy soul's way, and interrupt thy obedience to the
voice of God, and thy conformity to his holy will revealed
in thy soul, thou art engaged, under the penalty of damnation,
to part with them.

XXII. The way of God is a way of faith, as dark to
sense, as mortal to self. It is the children of obedience,
who count, with holy Paul, all things dross and dung, that
they may win Christ, and know and walk in this narrow
way. Speculation will not do, nor can refined notions
enter; the obedient only eat the good of this land.
(Isaiah, i. 19.) They that do his will, says the blessed
Jesus, shall know of my doctrine; (John, vii. 17;)
them He will instruct. There is no room for instruction,
where lawful self is lord, and not servant. For self cannot
receive it; that which should is oppressed by self, fearful,
and dare not. O! what will my father or mother say?
How will my husband use me? or finally, what will the
magistrate do with me? For though I have a most powerful
persuasion, and clear conviction upon my soul, of
this or that thing, yet considering how unmodish it is,
what enemies it has, and how strange and singular I shall
seem to them, I hope God will pity my weakness: if I[41]
sink, I am but flesh and blood; it may be hereafter He
may better enable me; and there is time enough. Thus
selfish, fearful man.

But deliberating is ever worst; for the soul loses in
parley: the manifestation brings power with it. Never
did God convince people, but, upon submission, he empowered
them. He requires nothing without giving
ability to perform it: that were mocking, not saving men.
It is enough for thee to do thy duty, that God shows thee
thy duty; provided thou closest with that light and spirit
by which he gives thee that knowledge. They that want
power, are such as do not receive Christ in his convictions
upon the soul, and such will always want it; but such as
do, they receive power, like those of old, to become the
children of God, through the pure obedience of faith.

XXIII. Wherefore, let me beseech you, by the love and
mercy of God, by the life and death of Christ, by the
power of his Spirit, and the hope of immortality, that you,
whose hearts are established in your temporal comforts,
and so lovers of self, more than of these heavenly things,
would let the time past suffice: that you would not think
it enough to be clear of such impieties, as too many are
found in, whilst your inordinate love of lawful things has
defiled your enjoyment of them, and drawn your hearts
from the fear, love, obedience, and self-denial of a true
disciple of Jesus. Turn about then, and hearken to the
still voice in thy conscience; it tells thee thy sins, and
thy misery in them; it gives a lively discovery of the very
vanity of the world, and opens to the soul some prospect
of eternity, and the comforts of the just that are at rest.
If thou adhere to this, it will divorce thee from sin and
self: thou wilt soon find, that the power of its charms
exceeds that of wealth, honour, and beauty of the world,
and finally will give thee that tranquillity which the
storms of time can never shipwreck nor disorder. Here[42]
all thy enjoyments are blest, though small, yet great by
that presence that is within them.

Even in this world the righteous have the better of it,
for they use the world without rebuke, because they do
not abuse it. They see and bless the hand that feeds,
and clothes, and preserves them. And as by beholding
him in all his works, they do not adore them, but him; so
the sweetness of his blessings that gives them, is an
advantage such have upon those that see him not. Besides,
in their increase, they are not lifted up, nor in their
adversities are they cast down: and why? Because they
are moderated in the one, and comforted in the other, by
his divine presence.

In short, heaven is the throne, and the earth but the
footstool of that man that hath self under foot. And
those that know that station will not easily be moved;
such learn to number their days, that they may not be
surprised with their dissolution; and to redeem their
time, because their days are evil; (Ephes. v. 16;) remembering
they are stewards, and must deliver up their
accounts to an impartial judge. Therefore not to self but
to him they live, and in him die, and are blessed with
them that die in the Lord. And thus I conclude my discourse
on the right use of lawful self.



[43]




CHAPTER V.



1. Of unlawful self; it is two-fold: 1st, in religion; 2nd, in morality.&mdash;2.
Of those that are most formal, superstitious, and
pompous in worship.&mdash;3. God's rebuke of carnal apprehensions.&mdash;4.
Christ drew off his disciples from the Jewish exterior worship,
and instituted a more spiritual one.&mdash;5. Stephen is full and plain
in this matter.&mdash;6. Paul refers the temple of God twice to man.&mdash;7.
Of the cross of these worldly worshippers.&mdash;8. Flesh and blood
make their cross, therefore cannot be crucified by it.&mdash;9. They
are yokes without restraint.&mdash;10. Of the gaudiness of their cross,
and their respect to it.&mdash;11. A recluse life no true gospel abnegation.&mdash;12.
Comparison between Christ's self-denial and theirs:
his leads to purity in the world, theirs to voluntary imprisonment,
that they might not be tempted of the world. The mischief
which that example, if followed, would do to the world. It
destroys useful society and honest labour. A lazy life the usual
refuge of idleness, poverty, and guilty age.&mdash;13. Of Christ's
cross in this case. The impossibility that such an external application
can remove an internal cause.&mdash;14. An exhortation to
the men of this belief, not to deceive themselves.


I. I am now come to unlawful self, which, more or less, is
the immediate concern of much the greater part of mankind.
This unlawful self is two-fold. First, that which
relates to religious worship: secondly, that which concerns
moral and civil conversation in the world. And
they are both of infinite consequence to be considered by
us. In which I shall be as brief as I may, with ease to
my conscience, and no injury to the matter.

II. That unlawful self in religion that ought to be mortified
by the cross of Christ, is man's invention and performance
of worship to God as divine, which is not so,[44]
either in its institution or performance. In this great
error those people have the van of all that attribute to
themselves the name of Christians, that are most exterior,
pompous, and superstitious in their worship; for they do
not only miss exceedingly by a spiritual unpreparedness,
in the way of their performing worship to God Almighty,
who is an Eternal Spirit; but the worship itself is composed
of what is utterly inconsistent with the very form
and practice of Christ's doctrine, and the apostolical
example. For whereas that was plain and spiritual, this
is gaudy and worldly: Christ's most inward and mental,
theirs most outward and corporeal: that suited to the
nature of God, who is a Spirit, this accommodated to the
most carnal part. So that instead of excluding flesh and
blood, behold a worship calculated to gratify them: as if
the business were not to present God with a worship to
please Him, but to make one to please themselves. A
worship dressed with such stately buildings and imagery,
rich furnitures and garments, rare voices and music, costly
lamps, wax candles, and perfumes; and all acted with
that most pleasing variety to the external senses that art
can invent or cost procure; as if the world were to turn
Jew or Egyptian again; or that God was an old man
indeed, and Christ a little boy, to be treated with a kind
of religious mask: for so they picture him in their
temples, and too many in their minds. And the truth is,
such a worship may very well suit such an idea of God:
for when men can think Him such a one as themselves, it
is not to be wondered if they address Him in a way that
would be the most pleasing from others to themselves.

III. But what said the Almighty to such a sensual
people of old, much upon the like occasion? "Thou
thoughtest I was such an one as thyself, but I will reprove
thee, and set thy sins in order before thee. Now consider
this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces and[45]
there be none to deliver." But, "to him that ordereth his
conversation aright, will I show the salvation of God."
(Psalm l. 21, 22, 23.) This is the worship acceptable to
him, "to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly
with God." (Mic. vi. 8.) For He that searcheth the heart,
and tries the reins of man, and sets his sins in order before
him, who is the God of the spirits of all flesh, looks not to
the external fabric, but internal frame of the soul, and inclination
of the heart. Nor is it to be soberly thought,
that He who is clothed with divine honour and majesty;
who covers himself with light as with a garment; who
stretches out the heavens like a curtain; who layeth the
beams of his chambers in the deep; who maketh the
clouds his chariot, and walks upon the wings of the wind:
who maketh his angels spirits, his ministers a flaming fire:
who laid the foundation of the earth, that it should not be
moved for ever; can be adequately worshipped by those
human inventions, the refuge of an apostate people from
the primitive power of religion and spirituality of Christian
worship.

IV. Christ drew off his disciples from the glory and
worship of the outward temple, and instituted a more
inward and spiritual worship, in which He instructed his
followers, "Ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at
Jerusalem," says Christ to the Samaritan woman, "worship
the Father; God is a Spirit, and they that worship
Him, must worship Him in spirit and in truth." (John, iv.
21.) As if he had said, for the sake of the weakness of
the people, God condescended in old time to limit himself
to an outward time, place, temple, and service, in and by
which he would be worshipped; but this was during
men's ignorance of his omnipresence, and that they considered
not what God is, nor where he is; but I am come
to reveal him to as many as receive me; and I tell you
that God is a spirit, and will be worshipped in Spirit and[46]
in truth. People must be acquainted with him as a spirit,
consider and worship him as such. It is not that bodily
worship, or these ceremonial services, in use among you
now, will serve, or give acceptance with this God that
is a Spirit: no, you must obey his Spirit that strives
with you, to gather you out of the evil of the world, that
by bowing to the instructions and commands of his Spirit in
your own souls, you may know what it is to worship him
as a Spirit; then you will understand that it is not going
to this mountain, nor to Jerusalem, but to do the will of
God, to keep his commandments, and commune with thine
own heart, and sin not; take up thy cross, meditate in his
holy law, and follow the example of Him whom the Father
hath sent.

V. Wherefore Stephen, that bold and constant martyr of
Jesus, told the Jews, when a prisoner at the bar for disputing
about the end of their beloved temple, and its services,
but falsely accused of blasphemy; "Solomon," said
Stephen, "built God an house; howbeit God dwelleth
not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what
house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the
place of my rest? Hath not my hand made all these
things?" (Acts, vii. 47-50.) Behold a total overthrow
to all worldly temples, and their ceremonial appendages.
The martyr follows his blow upon those apostate Jews,
who were of those times, the pompous, ceremonious,
worldly worshippers: "Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised
in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost; as
did your fathers, so do ye." (Acts, vii. 51.) As if He had
told them, no matter for your outward temples, rites, and
shadowy services, your pretensions to succession in nature
from Abraham; and by religion from Moses. You are
resisters of the Spirit, gainsayers of its instructions: you
will not bow to his counsel, nor are your hearts right towards[47]
God: you are the successors of your fathers' iniquity;
and though verbal admirers, yet none of the successors
of the prophets in faith and life.

But the prophet Isaiah carries it a little further than is
cited by Stephen. For after having declared what is not
God's house, the place where his honour dwells, immediately
follow these words: "But to this man will I look,
even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and
trembleth at my word." (Isaiah, lxvi. 2.) Behold, O
carnal and superstitious man, the true worshipper, and the
place of God's rest! This is the house and temple of
Him whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain; a house
self cannot build, nor the art or power of man prepare or
consecrate.

VI. Paul, that great apostle of the Gentiles, twice expressly
refers the word temple to man: once in his epistle
to the church of Corinth; "Know ye not," says he, "that
your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
you, which ye have of God?" &amp;c. (1 Cor. vi. 19,) and not
the building of man's hand and heart. Again, he tells the
same people, in his second epistle, "For ye are the temple
of the living God, as God hath said;" (2 Cor. vi. 16;)
and then cites God's words by the prophet, "I will dwell
in them, and walk in them; I will be their God, and they
shall be my people." This is the evangelical temple, the
Christian church, whose ornaments are not the embroideries
and furnitures of worldly art and wealth, but the
graces of the Spirit; meekness, love, faith, patience, self-denial,
and charity. Here it is, that the eternal wisdom,
that was with God from everlasting, before the hills were
brought forth, or the mountains laid, chooses to dwell;
"rejoicing," says Wisdom, "in the habitable part of the
earth, and my delights were with the sons of men:"
(Prov. viii. 22, 23, 25, 31;) not in houses built of wood
and stone. This living house is more glorious than Solomon's[48]
dead house; and of which his was but a figure, as
he, the Builder, was of Christ, who builds up a holy
temple to God. It was promised of old, that the glory
of the latter house should transcend the glory of the
former; (Hag. ii. 9;) which may be applied to this: not
one outward temple or house to excel another in outward
lustre; for where is the benefit of that? But the divine
glory, the beauty of holiness in the gospel house or
church, made up of renewed believers, should exceed the
outward glory of Solomon's temple, which in comparison
of the latter days, was but flesh to spirit, fading resemblance
to the eternal substance.

But for all this, Christians have meeting-places, yet not
in Jewish or Heathen state, but plain, void of pomp or
ceremony, suiting the simplicity of their blessed life and
doctrine. For God's presence is not with the house, but
with them that are in it, who are the gospel church, and
not the house. O! that such as call themselves Christians,
knew but a real sanctity in themselves, by the
washing of God's regenerating grace, instead of that imaginary
sanctity ascribed to places; they would then know
what the church is, and where, in these evangelical days,
is the place of God's appearance. This made the prophet
David say, "The king's daughter is all glorious within;
her clothing is of wrought gold." What is the glory that
is within the true church, and that gold that makes up
that inward glory? Tell me, O superstitious man! is it
thy stately temples, altars, tables, carpets, tapestries; thy
vestments, organs, voices, candles, lamps, censers, plate,
and jewels, with the like furniture of thy worldly temples?
No such matter; they bear no proportion with the divine
adornment of the King of Heaven's daughter, the blessed
and redeemed church of Christ. Miserable apostacy that
it is! and a wretched supplement in the loss and absence of
the apostolic life, the spiritual glory of the primitive church.

[49]

VII. But yet some of these admirers of external pomp
and glory in worship would be thought lovers of the cross,
and to that end have made to themselves many. But
alas! what hopes can there be of reconciling that to
Christianity, that the nearer it comes to its resemblance,
the further off it is in reality? for their very cross and
self-denial are most unlawful self: and whilst they fancy
to worship God thereby, they most dangerously err from
the true cross of Christ, and that holy abnegation that was
of his blessed appointment. It is true, they have got a
cross, but it seems to be in the room of the true one: and
so mannerly, that it will do as they will have it that wear
it; for instead of mortifying their wills by it, they made
it, and use it according to them. So that the cross is
become their ensign, that do nothing but what they list.
Yet by that they would be thought his disciples, who
never did his own will, but the will of his heavenly
Father.

VIII. This is such a cross as flesh and blood can carry,
for flesh and blood invented it; therefore not the cross of
Christ, that is to crucify flesh and blood. Thousands of
them have no more virtue than a chip: poor empty shadows,
not so much as images of the true one. Some carry
them for charms about them, but never repel one evil with
them. They sin with them upon their backs; and though
they put them in their bosoms, their beloved lusts lie
there too, without the least disquiet. They are as dumb
as Elijah's mock gods; (1 Kings, xviii. 27;) no life nor
power in them: and how should they, whose matter is
earthly, and whose figure and workmanship are but the
invention and labour of worldly artists? Is it possible that
such crosses should mend their makers? surely not.

IX. These are yokes without restraint, and crosses that
never contradict: a whole cart-load of them would leave a
man as unmortified as they find him. Men may sooner[50]
knock their brains out with them than their sins; and
that, I fear, too many of them know in their very consciences
that use them, indeed adore them: and, which
can only happen to the false cross, are proud of them too,
since the true one leaves no pride, where it is truly borne.

X. For as their religion, so their cross is very gaudy
and triumphant: but in what? In precious metals and
gems, the spoil of superstition upon the people's pockets.
These crosses are made of earthly treasure, instead of
teaching their hearts that wear them to deny it: and like
men, they are respected by their finery. A rich cross
shall have many gazers and admirers: the mean in this,
as other things, are more neglected. I could appeal to
themselves of this great vanity and superstition. O! how
very short is this of the blessed cross of Jesus, that takes
away the sins of the world!

XI. Nor is a recluse life, the boasted righteousness of
some, much more commendable, or one whit nearer to the
nature of the true cross: for if it be not unlawful as other
things are, it is unnatural, which true religion teaches not.
The Christian convent and monastery are within, where
the soul is encloistered from sin. And this religious house
the true followers of Christ carry about with them, who
exempt not themselves from the conversation of the world,
though they keep themselves from the evil of the world in
their conversation. That is a lazy, rusty, unprofitable
self-denial, burdensome to others to feed their idleness;
religious bedlams, where people are kept lest they should
do mischief abroad; patience per force; self-denial against
their will, rather ignorant than virtuous: and out of the
way of temptation, than content in it. No thanks if they
commit not what they are not tempted to commit. What
the eye views not, the heart craves not, as well as rues
not.

XII. The cross of Christ is of another nature; it truly[51]
overcomes the world, and leads a life of purity in the face
of its allurements; they that bear it are not thus chained
up, for fear they should bite; nor locked up, lest they
should be stolen away: no, they receive power from Christ
their captain, to resist the evil, and do that which is good
in the sight of God; to despise the world, and love its
reproach above its praise; and not only not to offend
others, but love those that offend them: though not for
offending them. What a world should we have if every
body, for fear of transgressing, should mew himself up
within four walls! No such matter; the perfection of the
Christian life extends to every honest labour or traffic
used among men. This severity is not the effect of
Christ's free spirit, but a voluntary, fleshly humility: mere
trammels of their own making and putting on, without
prescription or reason. In all which it is plain they are
their own lawgivers, and set their own rule, mulct, and
ransom: a constrained harshness, out of joint to the rest
of the creation; for society is one great end of it, and not
to be destroyed for fear of evil; but sin that spoils
it, banished by a steady reproof, and a conspicuous
example of tried virtue. True godliness does not turn
men out of the world, but enables them to live better in it,
and excites their endeavours to mend it; not to hide their
candle under a bushel, but to set it upon a table in a
candlestick. Besides, it is a selfish invention; and that
can never be the way of taking up the cross, which the
true cross is therefore taken up to subject. But again,
this humour runs away by itself, and leaves the world
behind to be lost; Christians should keep the helm, and
guide the vessel to its port; not meanly steal out at the
stern of the world, and leave those that are in it without a
pilot, to be driven by the fury of evil times, upon the rock
or sand of ruin. In fine, this sort of life, if taken up by
young people, is commonly to cover idleness, or to pay[52]
portions, to save the lazy from the pain of punishment, or
quality from the disgrace of poverty; one will not work,
and the other scorns it; if aged, a long life of guilt sometimes
flies to superstition for a refuge, and after having
had its own will in other things, would finish it in a wilful
religion to make God amends.

XIII. But taking up the cross of Jesus is a more interior
exercise: it is the circumspection and discipline of
the soul in conformity to the divine mind therein revealed.
Does not the body follow the soul, not the soul the body?
Do not such consider, that no outward cell can shut up
the soul from lust, the mind from an infinity of unrighteous
imaginations? The thoughts of man's heart are evil, and
that continually. Evil comes from within, and not from
without: how then can an external application remove an
internal cause; or a restraint upon the body, work a confinement
of the mind? which is much less than without
doors, for where there is least of action, there is most time
to think; and if those thoughts are not guided by a higher
principle, convents are more mischievous to the world
than exchanges. And yet retirement is both an excellent
and needful thing; crowds and throngs were not much
frequented by the ancient holy pilgrims.

XIV. But then examine, O man, thy foundation, what
it is, and who placed thee there; lest in the end it should
appear thou hast put an eternal cheat upon thy own soul.
I must confess I am jealous of the salvation of my own
kind, having found mercy with my heavenly Father. I
would have none to deceive themselves to perdition, especially
about religion, where people are most apt to take all
for granted, and lose infinitely by their own flatteries and
neglect. The inward, steady righteousness of Jesus is
another thing than all the contrived devotion of poor
superstitious man; and to stand approved in the sight of
God, excels that bodily exercise in religion, resulting from[53]
the invention of men. And the soul that is awakened and
preserved by his holy power and spirit, lives to Him in the
way of his own institution, and worships Him in his own
spirit, that is, in the holy sense, life, and leadings of it:
which indeed is the evangelical worship. Not that I
would be thought to slight a true retirement: for I do not
only acknowledge but admire solitude. Christ himself
was an example of it: He loved and chose to frequent
mountains, gardens, and sea-sides. It is requisite to the
growth of piety, and I reverence the virtue that seeks and
uses it; wishing there were more of it in the world: but
then it should be free, not constrained. What benefit to
the mind, to have it for a punishment, and not for a pleasure?
Nay, I have long thought it an error among all
sorts, that use not monastic lives, that they have no retreats
for the afflicted, the tempted, the solitary, and the
devout, where they might undisturbedly wait upon God,
pass through their religious exercises, and, being thereby
strengthened, may, with more power over their own spirits,
enter into the business of the world again: though the less
the better, to be sure. For divine pleasures are found in a
free solitude.



[54]




CHAPTER VI.



1. But men of more refined belief and practice are yet concerned in
this unlawful self about religion.&mdash;2. It is the rise of the performance
of worship God regards.&mdash;3. True worship is only from a
heart prepared by God's Spirit.&mdash;4. The soul of man is dead without
the divine breath of life, and so not capable of worshipping
the living God.&mdash;5. We are not to study what to pray for. How
Christians should pray. The aid they have from God.&mdash;6. The
way of obtaining this preparation: it is by waiting, as David and
others did of old, in holy silence, that their wants and supplies
are best seen.&mdash;7. The whole and the full think they need not this
waiting, and so use it not; but the poor in spirit are of another
mind, wherefore the Lord hears, and fills them with his good things.&mdash;8.
If there were not this preparation, the Jewish times would
have been more holy and spiritual than the gospel; for even then
it was required; much more now.&mdash;9. As sin, so formality, cannot
worship God: thus David, Isaiah, &amp;c.&mdash;10. God's own forms
and institutions hateful to Him, unless his own Spirit use them;
much more those of man's contriving.&mdash;11. God's children ever
met God in his way, not their own; and in his way they always
found help and comfort. In Jeremiah's time it was the same;
his goodness was manifested to his children that waited truly upon
him: it was an inward sense and enjoyment of him they thirsted
after. Christ charged his disciples also to wait for the Spirit.&mdash;12.
This doctrine of waiting further opened, and ended with an
allusion to the pool of Bethesda; a lively figure of inward waiting
and its blessed effects.&mdash;13. Four things necessary to worship;
the sanctification of the worshipper, and the consecration of the
offering, and the thing to be prayed for, and lastly, faith to pray
in: and all must be right, that is, of God's giving.&mdash;14. The
great power of faith in prayer; witness the importunate woman.
The wicked and formal ask, and receive not; the reason why.
But Jacob and his true offspring, the followers of his faith, prevail.&mdash;15.
This shows why Christ upbraided his disciples with
their little faith. The necessity of faith. Christ works no good[55]
on men without it.&mdash;16. This faith is not only possible now but
necessary.&mdash;17. What it is, further unfolded.&mdash;18. Who the
heirs of this faith are; and what were the noble works of it in
the former ages of the just.


I. But there be others of a more refined speculation, and
reformed practice, who dare not use, and less adore, a
piece of wood or stone, an image of silver and gold; nor
yet allow of that Jewish, or rather Pagan pomp in worship,
practised by others, as if Christ's worship were of this
world, though his kingdom be of the other, but are doctrinally
averse to such superstition, and yet refrain not to
bow to their own religious duties, and esteem their formal
performance of several parts of worship that go against
the grain of their fleshly ease, and a preciseness therein,
no small cross unto them; and that if they abstain from
gross and scandalous sins, or if the act be not committed,
though the thoughts of it are embraced, and that it has a
full career in the mind, they hold themselves safe enough
within the pale of discipleship and walls of Christianity.
But this also is too mean a character of the discipline of
Christ's cross: and those that flatter themselves with such
a sort of taking it up, will in the end be deceived with a
sandy foundation, and a midnight cry. For said Christ,
"But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall
speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of
judgment." (Matt. xii. 36.)

II. For first, it is not performing duties of religion, but
the rise of the performance that God looks at. Men may,
and some do, cross their own wills in their own wills: voluntary
omission and commission: "Who has required
this at your hands?" (Isa. i. 12,) said the Lord of old to
the Jews, when they seemed industrious to have served
him; but it was in a way of their own contriving or inventing,
and in their own time and will; not with the
soul truly touched and prepared by the divine power of[56]
God, but bodily worship only: that, the apostle tells us,
profits little. Not keeping to the manner of taking up the
cross in worship as well as other things, has been a great
cause of the troublesome superstition that is yet in the
world. For men have no more brought their worship to
the test, than their sins: nay less; for they have ignorantly
thought the one a sort of excuse for the other; and
not that their religious performances should need a cross,
or an apology.

III. But true worship can only come from a heart prepared
by the Lord. (Prov. xvi. 1; Rom viii. 14.) This
preparation is by the sanctification of the Spirit; by
which, if God's children are led in the general course of
their lives, as Paul teaches, much more in their worship to
their Creator and Redeemer. And whatever prayer be
made, or doctrine be uttered, and not from the preparation
of the Holy Spirit, it is not acceptable with God: nor
can it be the true evangelical worship, which is in spirit
and truth; that is, by the preparation and aid of the
Spirit. For what is a heap of the most pathetical words
to God Almighty; or the dedication of any place or time
to him? He is a Spirit, to whom words, places, and
times, strictly considered, are improper or inadequate.
And though they be the instruments of public worship,
they are but bodily and visible, and cannot carry our
requests any further, much less recommend them to the
invisible God; by no means; they are for the sake of the
congregation: it is the language of the soul God hears,
nor can that speak but by the Spirit, or groan aright to
Almighty God without the assistance of it.

IV. The soul of man, however lively in other things, is
dead to God, till He breathe the spirit of life into it: it
cannot live to Him, much less worship Him, without it.
Thus God tells us, by Ezekiel, when in a vision of the
restoration of mankind, in the person of Israel, an usual[57]
way of speaking among the prophets, and as often mistaken,
"I will open your graves," saith the Lord, "and
put my Spirit in you, and you shall live." (Ezek. xxxvii.
12-14.) So, though Christ taught his disciples to pray,
they were, in some sort, disciples before he taught them;
not worldly men, whose prayers are an abomination to
God. And his teaching them is not an argument that
every body must say that prayer, whether he can say it
with the same heart, and under the same qualifications, as
his poor disciples or followers did, or not; as is now too
superstitiously and presumptuously practised; but rather
as they then, so we now, are not to pray our own prayers,
but his: that is, such as He enables us to make, as He
enabled them then.

V. For if we are not to take thought what we shall say
when we come before worldly princes, because it shall
then be given us; and that "it is not we that speak, but
the Spirit of our heavenly Father that speaketh in us;"
(Matt. x. 19, 20;) much less can our ability be needed, or
ought we to study to ourselves forms of speech in our approaches
to the great Prince of princes, King of kings, and
Lord of lords. For be it his greatness, we ought not by
Christ's command; be it our relation to him as children,
we need not; he will help us, he is our Father; that is,
if he be so indeed. Thus not only the mouth of the body
but of the soul is shut, till God opens it; and then he
loves to hear the language of it. In which the body
ought never to go before the soul: his ear is open to such
requests, and his Spirit strongly intercedes for those that
offer them.

VI. But it may be asked, how shall this preparation be
obtained?

I answer: By waiting patiently, yet watchfully and intently
upon God: "Lord," says the Psalmist, "thou hast
heard the desire of the humble; thou wilt prepare their[58]
heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:" (Psalm x. 17:)
and, says wisdom, "The preparation of the heart in man
is from the Lord." (Prov. xvi. 1.) Here it is thou must
not think thy own thoughts, nor speak thy own words,
which indeed is the silence of the holy cross, but be
sequestered from all the confused imaginations that are
apt to throng and press upon the mind in those holy
retirements. It is not for thee to think to overcome the
Almighty by the most composed matter, cast into the
aptest phrase; no, no; one groan, one sigh, from a wounded
soul, a heart touched with true remorse, a sincere and
godly sorrow, which is the work of God's Spirit, excels
and prevails with God. Wherefore stand still in thy
mind, wait to feel something that is divine, to prepare and
dispose thee to worship God truly and acceptably. And
thus taking up the cross, and shutting the doors and
windows of the soul against everything that would
interrupt this attendance upon God, how pleasant
soever the object be in itself, how lawful or needful
at another season, the power of the Almighty will
break in, his Spirit will work and prepare the heart, that it
may offer up an acceptable sacrifice. It is he that discovers
and presses wants upon the soul; and when it
cries, it is he alone that supplies them. Petitions, not
springing from such a sense and preparation, are formal
and fictitious: they are not true; for men pray in their
own blind desires, and not in the will of God; and his
ear is stopped to them: "but for the oppression of the
poor, for the sighing of the needy," God hath said, "I
will arise;" (Psalm xii. 5;) that is, the poor in spirit, the
needy soul, those that want his assistance, who are ready
to be overwhelmed, that feel a need, and cry aloud for a
deliverer, and that have none on earth to help: none in
heaven but Him, nor in the earth in comparison of Him:
"He will deliver," said David, "the needy when he cries,[59]
and the poor, and him that has no helper." (Psalm lxxii.
12, 14.) He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence,
and precious shall their blood be in His sight.
"This poor man," says he, "cried, and the Lord heard
him, and saved him out of all his troubles." (Psalm
xxxiv. 6-8.) "The angel of the Lord encampeth round
about them that fear him, and delivers them," and then
invites all to come and taste how good the Lord is; "yea,
He will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and
great." (Psalm cxv. 13.)

VII. But what is that to them that are not hungry?
"They that be whole need not a physician:" (Matt. ix. 12;)
the full have no need to sigh, nor the rich to cry for help.
Those that are not sensible of their inward wants, that
have not fears and terrors upon them, who feel no need of
God's power to help them, nor of the light of his countenance
to comfort them, what have such to do with prayer?
their devotion is but at best, a serious mockery of the
Almighty. They know not, they want not, they desire
not what they pray for. They pray the will of God may
be done, and do constantly their own: for though it be
soon said, it is a most terrible thing to them. They ask
for grace, and abuse that they have: they pray for the
Spirit, but resist it in themselves, and scorn at it in others:
they request mercies and goodness of God, and feel no
real want of them. And in this inward insensibility, they
are as unable to praise God for what they have, as to pray
for what they have not. "They shall praise the Lord,"
says David, "that seek him: for he satisfieth the longing
soul, and filleth the hungry with good things." (Psalm
xxii. 26; cvii. 8.) This also he reserves for the poor and
needy, and those that fear God. Let the spiritually poor
and the needy praise thy name: ye that fear the Lord,
praise him; and ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him. Jacob
was a plain man, of an upright heart: and they that are[60]
so, are his seed. And though (with him) they may be as
poor as worms in their own eyes, yet they receive power
to wrestle with God, and prevail as he did.

VIII. But without the preparation and consecration of
this power, no man is fit to come before God; else it were
matter of less holiness and reverence to worship God
under the gospel, than it was in the times of the law,
when all sacrifices were sprinkled before offered; the
people consecrated that offered them, before they presented
themselves before the Lord. (Numb. viii., xix.;
2 Chron. xxix. 36; xxx. 16, 17.) If the touching of a
dead or unclean beast then made people unfit for temple
or sacrifice, yea, society with the clean, till first sprinkled
and sanctified, how can we think so meanly of the worship
that is instituted by Christ in gospel times, as that it
should admit of unprepared and unsanctified offerings?
Or, allow that those, who either in thoughts, words, or
deeds, do daily touch that which is morally unclean, can,
without coming to the blood of Jesus, that sprinkles the
conscience from dead works, acceptably worship the pure
God: it is a downright contradiction to good sense: the
unclean cannot acceptably worship that which is holy;
the impure that which is perfect. There is a holy intercourse
and communion betwixt Christ and his followers;
but none at all betwixt Christ and Belial; between him
and those that disobey his commandments, and live not
the life of his blessed cross and self-denial. (2 Cor. vi.
15, 16.)

IX. But as sin, so formality cannot worship God; no,
though the manner were of his own ordination. Which
made the prophet, personating one in a great strait, cry
out, "Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow
myself before the high God? shall I come before him
with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? will the
Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands[61]
of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression,
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He
hath showed, thee, O man, what is good; and what doth
the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and
to walk humbly with thy God?" (Micah, vi. 6-8.) The
royal prophet, sensible of this, calls thus also upon God;
"O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show
forth thy praise." (Psalm li. 15-17.) He did not dare
open his own lips, he knew that could not praise God;
and why? "for thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I
give it:" if my formal offerings would serve, thou shouldst
not want them; thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.
"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and
a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise:" and
why? because this is God's work, the effect of his power;
and his own works praise him. To the same purpose
doth God himself speak by the mouth of Isaiah, in opposition
to the formalities and lip-worship of the degenerate
Jews: "Thus saith the Lord, the heaven is my throne,
and the earth is my footstool, where is the house that ye
build to me? and where is the place of my rest? For all
these things hath my hand made. But to this man will I
look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and
trembleth at my word." (Isaiah, lxvi. 1, 2.) O behold
the true worshipper! one of God's preparing, circumcised
in heart and ear, that resists not the Holy Spirit, as those
lofty professing Jews did. Was this so then, even in the
time of the law, which was the dispensation of external
and shadowy performances: and can we now expect
acceptance without the preparation of the Spirit of the
Lord in these gospel times, which are the proper times
for the effusion of the Spirit? By no means: God is
what he was; and none else are his true worshippers, but
such as worship him in his own spirit: these he tenders
as the apple of his eye; the rest do but mock him, and[62]
he despises them. Hear what follows to that people, for
it is the state and portion of Christendom at this day;
"He that killeth an ox, is as if he slew a man; he that
sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that
offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he
that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they
have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in
their abominations." (Isaiah, lxvi. 3.) Let none say, we
offer not these kinds of oblations, for that is not the
matter; God was not offended with the offerings, but
offerers. These were the legal forms of sacrifice by God
appointed; but they not presenting them in that frame of
spirit, and under that right disposition of soul that was
required, God declares his abhorrence, and that with
great aggravation; and elsewhere, by the same prophet,
forbids them to bring any more vain oblations before him;
"incense," saith God, "is an abomination to me: your
sabbaths and calling of assemblies I cannot away with;
it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting." And "when
you spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from
you; when you make many prayers, I will not hear you."
(Isaiah, i. 13-18.) A most terrible renunciation of their
worship; and why? Because their hearts were polluted;
they loved not the Lord with their whole hearts,
but broke his law, and rebelled against his Spirit, and did
not that which was right in his sight. The cause is
plain, by the amendment He requires; "Wash ye," says
the Lord, "make you clean, put away the evil of your
doings from before mine eyes: cease to do evil, learn to
do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the
fatherless, plead for the widow." Upon these terms, and
nothing short, He bids them come to Him, and tells them,
that "though their sins be as scarlet, they shall be white
as snow; and though they be as crimson, they shall be
white as wool."

[63]

So true is that notable passage of the Psalmist, "Come
and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he
hath done for my soul: I cried to him with my mouth,
and he was extolled with my tongue. If I regard iniquity
in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. But verily God
hath heard me: he hath attended to the voice of my
prayer. Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my
prayer, nor his mercy from me." (Psalm lxvi. 16, 20.)

X. Much of this kind might be cited, to show the displeasure
of God against even his own forms of worship,
when performed without his own Spirit, and that necessary
preparation of the heart in man, that nothing else
can work or give: which above all other penmen of
sacred writ, is most frequently and emphatically recommended
to us by the example of the Psalmist, who ever
and anon calling to mind his own great slips, and the
cause of them, and the way by which he came to be
accepted of God, and to obtain strength and comfort from
him, reminds himself to wait upon God. "Lead me in
thy truth, and teach me, for thou art the God of my salvation;
on thee do I wait all the day long." (Psalm xxv. 5.)
His soul looked to God for salvation, to be delivered from
the snares and evils of the world. This shows an inward
exercise, and a spiritual attendance, that stood not in
external forms, but in inward divine aid.

And truly, David had great encouragement so to do; the
goodness of God invited him to it and strengthened him
in it. For says he, "I waited patiently for the Lord;
and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. He brought
me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
and set my feet upon a rock." (Psalm xl. 1, 2.) That is,
the Lord appeared inwardly to console David's soul, that
waited for his help, and to deliver it from the temptations
and afflictions that were ready to overwhelm it, and gave
him security and peace. Therefore, he says, "The Lord[64]
hath established my goings;" that is, fixed his mind in
righteousness. Before, every step he took bemired him,
and he was scarcely able to go without falling: temptation
on all hands; but he waited patiently upon God:
his mind retired, watchful, and intent to his law and
Spirit; and he felt the Lord to incline to him. His needy
and sensible cry entered heaven, and prevailed; then
came deliverance and rescue to David, in God's time, not
David's strength to go through his exercises, and surmount
all his troubles. For which he tells us, a new
song was put into his mouth, even praises to his God.
(Psalm xl. 3.) But it was of God's making and putting,
and not his own.

Another time, we have him crying thus: "As the hart
panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after
thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living
God; when shall I come and appear before God?" This
goes beyond formality, and can be tied to no lesson.
But we may by this see, that true worship is an inward
work; that the soul must be touched and raised in its
heavenly desires by the heavenly Spirit, and that the
true worship is in God's presence. When shall I come
and appear? Not in the temple, nor with outward sacrifices,
but before God in his presence. So that souls of
true worshippers see God, make their appearance before
him; and this they wait, they pant, they thirst for. O
how is the greater part of Christendom degenerated from
David's example! No wonder therefore that this good
man tells us, "Truly my soul waiteth upon God;" and
that he gives it in charge to his soul so to do; "O my
soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is
from him." As if he had said, None else can prepare
my heart, or supply my wants; so that my expectation is
not from my own voluntary performance, or the bodily
worship I can give him; they are of no value; they can[65]
neither help me, nor please him. But I wait upon him
for strength and power to present myself so before him, as
may be most pleasing to him; for he that prepares the
sacrifice will certainly accept it. Wherefore in two verses
he repeats it thrice; "I wait for the Lord&mdash;My soul doth
wait&mdash;My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that
watch for the morning." Yea, so intently, and with that
unweariedness of soul, that he says in one place, "Mine
eyes fail while I wait for my God." (Psalm lxix. 3.)
He was not contented with so many prayers, such a set
worship, or limited repetition: no; he leaves not till he
finds the Lord, that is, the comforts of his presence:
which brings the answer of love and peace to his soul.
Nor was this his practice only, as a man more than ordinarily
inspired; for he speaks of it as the way of worship,
then amongst the true people of God, the spiritual Israel,
and circumcision in heart, of that day: "Behold," says he,
"as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
mistress, so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God until he
have mercy on us." (Psalm cxxiii. 2.) In another place,
"Our soul waiteth for the Lord; he is our help and our
shield." (Psalm xxxiii. 20.) "I will wait on thy name,
for it is good before thy saints." (Psalm lii. 9.) It was in
request with the truly godly in that day, and the way
they came to enjoy God, and worship him acceptably.
And from his own experience of the benefit of waiting
upon God, and the saints' practice of those times, he
recommends it to others: "Wait upon the Lord: be of
good courage, and he will strengthen thy heart: wait, I
say, on the Lord." (Psalm xxvii. 14.) That is, wait in
faith and patience, and he will come to save thee. Again,
"Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently upon him." That
is, cast thyself upon him; be contented, and wait for him
to help thee in thy wants; thou canst not think how near[66]
he is to help those that wait upon him: O try and have
faith. Yet again, he bids us, "Wait upon the Lord, and
keep his way." (Psalm xxxvii. 34.) Behold the reason
why so few profit! they are out of his way; and such
can never wait rightly upon him. Great reason had
David for what he said, who had with so much comfort
and advantage met the Lord in his blessed way.

XI. The prophet Isaiah tells us, that though the chastisements
of the Lord were sore upon the people for their
backslidings, yet in the way of his judgments, in the way
of his rebukes and displeasure, they waited for him,
and the desire of their soul, that is the great point,
was to his name, and the remembrance of him.
(Isaiah, xxvi. 8.) They were contented to be chid
and chastised, for they had sinned; and the knowledge
of him so was very desirable to them. But what!
did he not come at last, and that in mercy too? Yes,
he did, and they knew him when he came, a doctrine the
brutish world knows not, "This is our God; we have
waited for him, and he will save us." (Isaiah, xxv. 9.)
O blessed enjoyment! O precious confidence! here is a
waiting in faith which prevailed. All worship not in
faith is fruitless to the worshipper, as well as displeasing
to God: and this faith is the gift of God, and the nature
of it is to purify the heart, and give such as truly believe
victory over the world. Well, but they go on: "We have
waited for him; we will be glad, and rejoice in his salvation."
The prophet adds, "Blessed are all they that wait
upon God:" and why? for "they that wait upon the Lord
shall renew their strength;" they shall never faint, never
be weary: (Isaiah, xxx. 18; xl. 31:) the encouragement
is great. O hear him once more: "For since the beginning
of the world, men have not heard, nor perceived by
the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God! besides thee,
what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him."[67]
(Isaiah, lxiv. 4.) Behold the inward life and joy of the
righteous, the true worshippers; those whose spirits bowed
to the appearance of God's Spirit in them, leaving and
forsaking all it appeared against, and embracing whatever
it led them to. In Jeremiah's time, the true worshippers
also waited upon God: (Jer. xiv. 22:) and he assures us,
that "The Lord is good to them that wait for them to the
soul that seeketh him." (Lam. iii. 25.) Hence it is, that
the prophet Hosea exhorts the church then to turn and
wait upon God. "Therefore turn thou to thy God; keep
mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually."
(Hos. xii. 6.) And Micah is very zealous and resolute in
this good exercise: "I will look unto the Lord, I will
wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me."
(Mic. vii. 7.) Thus did the children of the Spirit, that
thirsted after an inward sense of him. The wicked
cannot say so; nor they that pray, unless they wait. It
is charged upon Israel in the wilderness, as the cause of
their disobedience and ingratitude to God, that they
waited not for his counsels. We may be sure it is our
duty, and expected from us; for God requires it in
Zephaniah: "Therefore wait upon me, saith the Lord,
until the day that I arise," &amp;c. (Zeph. iii. 8.) O that all
who profess the name of God, would wait so, and not
offer to arise to worship without him. And they would
feel his stirrings and arisings in them to help and prepare,
and sanctify them. Christ expressly charged his disciples,
"They should not stir from Jerusalem, but wait
till they had received the promise of the Father, the baptism
of the Holy Ghost," (Acts, i. 4, 8,) in order to their
preparation for the preaching of the glorious gospel of
Christ to the world. And though that were an extraordinary
effusion for an extraordinary work, yet the degree
does not change the kind; on the contrary, if so much
waiting and preparation by the Spirit was requisite to fit[68]
them to preach to man; some, at least, may be needful to
fit us to speak to God.

XII. I will close this great Scripture doctrine of waiting,
with that passage in John about the pool of Bethesda:
"There is at Jerusalem, by the sheep-market, a pool,
which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having
five porches; in these lay a great multitude of impotent
folks, of blind, halt, and withered, waiting for the moving
of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season
into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then
first after the troubling of the water, stepped in, was made
whole of whatsoever disease he had." (John, v. 2-4.)
A most exact representation of what is intended by all
that has been said upon the subject of waiting. For as
there was then an outward and legal, so there is now a
gospel and spiritual Jerusalem, the church of God; consisting
of the faithful. The pool in that old Jerusalem, in
some sort, represented that fountain, which is now set
open in this new Jerusalem. That pool was for those
that were under infirmities of body; this fountain for all
that are impotent in soul. There was an angel then that
moved the water, to render it beneficial; it is God's angel
now, the great angel of his presence, that blesseth this
fountain with success. They that then went in before,
and did not watch the angel, and take advantage of his
motion, found no benefit of their stepping in: those that
now wait not the moving of God's angel, but by the
devotion of their own forming and timing, rush before
God, as the horse into the battle, and hope for success,
are sure to miscarry in their expectation. Therefore, as
then they waited with all patience and attention upon the
angel's motion, that wanted and desired to be cured; so
do the true worshippers of God now, that need and pray
for his presence, which is the life of their souls, as the sun
is to the plants of the field. They have often tried the[69]
unprofitableness of their own work, and are now come to
the sabbath indeed. They dare not put up a device of
their own, or offer an unsanctified request, much less
obtrude bodily worship, where the soul is really insensible
or unprepared by the Lord. In the light of Jesus they
ever wait to be prepared, retired, and recluse from all
thoughts that cause the least distraction and discomposure
in the mind, till they see the angel move, and till
their beloved please to awake: nor dare they call him
before his time. And they fear to make a devotion in his
absence; for they know it is not only unprofitable, but
reprovable: "Who has required this at your hands?"
"He that believes, makes not haste." (Isaiah, i. 12;
xxviii. 16.) They that worship with their own, can only
do as the Israelites, turn their earrings into a molten
image, and be cursed for their pains. Nor fared they
better, "that gathered sticks of old, and kindled a fire,
and compassed themselves about with the sparks that
they had kindled;" (Isaiah, l. 11) for God told them,
"they should lie down in sorrow." It should not only be
of no advantage, and do them no good, but incur a judgment
from him: sorrow and anguish of soul should be
their portion. Alas! flesh and blood would fain pray,
though it cannot wait; and be a saint, though it cannot
abide to do or suffer the will of God; with the tongue
it blesses God, and with the tongue it curses men, made
in his similitude. It calls Jesus LORD, but not by the
Holy Ghost; and often names the name of Jesus, yea,
bows the knee to it too; but departs not from iniquity:
this is abominable to God.

XIII. In short, there are four things so necessary
to worshipping God aright, and which put its performance
beyond man's power, that there seems little more
needed than the naming of them. The first is, the sanctification
of the worshipper. Secondly, the consecration of[70]
the offering; which has been spoken to before somewhat
largely. Thirdly, what to pray for; which no man
knows that prays not by the aid of God's Spirit; and
therefore without that Spirit no man can truly pray. This
the apostle puts beyond dispute; "We know not," says
he, "what we would pray for, as we ought, but the Spirit
helpeth our infirmities." (Rom. viii. 26.) Men unacquainted
with the work and power of the Holy Spirit,
are ignorant of the mind of God; and those, certainly,
can never please him with their prayers. It is not
enough to know we want; but we should learn whether
it be not sent as a blessing, disappointments to the proud,
losses to the covetous, and to the negligent stripes; to
remove these, were to secure the destruction, not help the
salvation of the soul.

The vile world knows nothing but carnally, after a
fleshly manner and interpretation; and too many that
would be thought enlightened are apt to call providences
by wrong names, for instance, afflictions they style judgments,
and trials, more precious than the beloved gold,
they call miseries. On the other hand, they call the preferments
of the world by the name of honour, and its
wealth happiness; when for once that they are so, it
is much to be feared they are sent of God a hundred
times for judgments, at least trials, upon their possessors.
Therefore, what to keep, what to reject, what to want, is
a difficulty God only can resolve the soul. And since
God knows better than we what we need, he can better
tell us what to ask than we can him: which made Christ
exhort his disciples to avoid long and repetitious prayers;
(Matt. vi. 7, 8;) telling them that their heavenly Father
knew what they needed before they asked: and therefore
gave them a pattern to pray by; not as some fancy, to be
a text for human liturgies, which of all services are most
justly noted and taxed for length and repetition; but[71]
expressly to reprove and avoid them. But if those wants
that are the subject of prayer were once agreed upon,
though that might be a weighty point, yet how to pray is
of still greater moment than to pray; it is not the request,
but the frame of the petitioner's spirit. The what may be
proper, but the how defective. As I said, God needs not
to be told of our wants by us, who must tell them to us;
yet he will be told them from us, that both we may seek
him, and he may come down to us. But when this is
done, "To this man will I look, saith the Lord, even
to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and that
trembleth at my word:" (Isaiah, lxvi. 2.) to the sick
heart, the wounded soul, the hungry and thirsty, the weary
and heavy laden ones: such sincerely want a helper.

XIV. Nor is this sufficient to complete gospel-worship;
the fourth requisite must be had, and that is faith; true
faith, precious faith, the faith of God's chosen, that purifies
their hearts, that overcomes the world, and is the
victory of the saints. (1 Tim. i. 5; Acts, xv. 9; Tit. i. 1;
2 Pet. i. 1; 1 John, v. 4.) This is that which animates
prayer and presses it home, like the importunate woman,
that would not be denied; to whom Christ, seeming to
admire, said, "O woman, great is thy faith!" (Matt. xv.
28.) This is of the highest moment on our part, to give
our addresses success with God; and yet not in our power
neither, for it is the gift of God: from him we must have
it; and with one grain of it more work is done, more
deliverance is wrought, and more goodness and mercy
received, than by all the runnings, willings, and toilings of
man, with his inventions and bodily exercises: which,
duly weighed, will easily spell out the meaning, why so
much worship should bring so little profit to the world, as
we see it does, viz. true faith is lost. "They ask, and
receive not; they seek, and find not: they knock, and it is
not opened unto them:" (James, iv. 3:) the case is plain;[72]
their requests are not mixed with purifying faith, by
which they should prevail, as good Jacob's were, when he
wrestled with God and prevailed. And the truth is, the
generality are yet in their sins, following hearts' lusts, and
living in worldly pleasure, being strangers to this precious
faith. It is the reason rendered by the deep author to the
Hebrews, of the unprofitableness of the word preached to
some in those days; "Not being," says he, "mixed with
faith in them that heard it." Can the minister then
preach without faith? No: and much less can any
man pray to purpose without faith, especially when we
are told, that "the just live by faith." For worship is
the supreme act of man's life; and whatever is necessary
to inferior acts of religion must not be wanting
there.

XV. This may moderate the wonder in any, why
Christ so often upbraided his disciples with, O ye of little
faith! yet tells us, that one grain of it, though as little as
that of mustard, one of the least of seeds, if true and right,
is able to remove mountains. As if he had said, There is
no temptation so powerful that it cannot overcome: wherefore
those that are captivated by temptations, and remain
unsupplied in their spiritual wants, have not this powerful
faith: that is the true cause. So necessary was it of old,
that Christ did not many mighty works where the people
believed not; and though his power wrought wonders in
other places, faith opened the way: so that it is hard to
say, whether that power by faith, or faith by that power,
wrought the cure. Let us call to mind what famous
things a little clay and spittle, one touch of the hem of
Christ's garment, and a few words out of his mouth,
(John, ix. 6; Luke, viii. 47, 48,) did by the force of faith
in the patients: "Believe ye that I am able to open your
eyes?" (Matt. ix. 28;) "Yea, Lord," say the blind, and
see. To the ruler, "only believe;" (Matt. ix. 23;) he did,[73]
and his dead daughter recovered life. Again, "If thou
canst believe:" I do believe; says the father, help my unbelief:
and the evil spirit was chased away, and the child
recovered. He said to one, "Go, thy faith hath made
thee whole;" (Mark, x. 52; Luke, vii. 48, 50;) and to
another, "Thy faith hath saved thee; thy sins are forgiven
thee." (Matt. xxi. 21, 22.) And to encourage his disciples
to believe, that were admiring how soon his sentence
was executed upon the fruitless fig-tree, he tells
them, "Verily, if ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall
not only do this, which is done to the fig-tree; but also,
if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and
cast into the sea, it shall be done: and all things whatsoever
ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive,"
(Matt. xviii. 19; Luke, xviii. 27.) This one passage convicts
Christendom of gross infidelity; for she prays, and
receives not.

XVI. But some may say, It is impossible to receive all
that a man may ask. It is not impossible to receive all
that a man, that so believes, can ask. (Mark, ix. 23.)
The fruits of faith are not impossible to those that truly
believe in the God that makes them possible. When
Jesus said to the ruler, "If thou canst believe," he adds,
"all things are possible to him that believeth." (Matt.
xix. 26.) Well, but then some will say, It is impossible
to have such faith: for this very faithless generation
would excuse their want of faith, by making it impossible
to have the faith they want. But Christ's answer to the
infidelity of that age, will best confute the disbelief of
this. "The things that are impossible with men, are
possible with God." (Heb. xi. 6.) It will follow then,
that it is not impossible with God to give that faith;
though it is certain that without it it is impossible to
please God: (1 Tim. i. 5; iii. 9:) for so the author to the
Hebrews teaches. And if it be else impossible to please[74]
God, it must be so to pray to God without this precious
faith.

XVII. But some may say, What is this faith that is so
necessary to worship, and gives it such acceptance with
God and returns that benefit to men? I say, It is a holy
resignation to God, and confidence in him, testified by a
religious obedience to his holy requirings, which gives
sure evidence to the soul of the things not yet seen, and a
general sense and taste of the substance of those things
that are hoped for; that is, the glory which is to be
revealed hereafter. As this faith is the gift of God, so it
purifies the hearts of those that receive it. The apostle
Paul is witness, that it will not dwell but in a pure conscience:
he therefore in one place couples a pure heart
and faith unfeigned together: in another, faith and a
good conscience. James joins faith with righteousness,
(James, ii.) and John with victory over the world;
(1 John, v. 4;) "This," says be, "is the victory
which overcomes the world, even our faith." (Rom.
iv. 1, 2.)

XVIII. The heirs of this faith are the true children
of Abraham, (John, xvi. 9, 10,) in that they walk in
the steps of Abraham, according to the obedience of faith,
which only entitles people to be the children of Abraham.
This lives above the world, not only in its sin, but righteousness:
to this no man comes, but through death to
self by the cross of Jesus, and an entire dependence by
him, upon God.

Famous are the exploits of this divine gift; time would
fail to recount them: all sacred story is filled with them.
But let it suffice, that by it the holy ancients endured all
trials, overcame all enemies, prevailed with God, renowned
his truth, finished their testimony, and obtained the reward
of the faithful, a crown of righteousness, which is the
eternal blessedness of the just.

I. Having thus discharged my conscience against that
part of unlawful self, that fain would be a Christian, a
believer, a saint, whilst a plain stranger to the cross of
Christ, and the holy exercises of it; and in that briefly
discovered what is true worship, and the use and business
of the holy cross therein, to render its performance pleasing
to Almighty God; I shall now, the same Lord assisting
me, more largely prosecute that other part of unlawful
self, which fills the study, care, and conversation of the[76]
world, presented to us in these three capital lusts, that is
to say, pride, avarice, and luxury; from whence all other
mischiefs daily flow, as streams from their proper fountains:
the mortifying of which makes up the other; and
indeed a very great part of the work of the true cross;
and though last in place, yet first in experience and duty:
which done, it introduces in the room of those evil habits,
the blessed effects of that so much needed reformation, to
wit, mortification, humility, temperance, love, patience,
and heavenly-mindedness, with all other graces of the
Spirit, becoming followers of the perfect Jesus, that most
heavenly man.

The care and love of all mankind are either directed to
God or themselves. Those that love God above all, are
ever humbling self to his commands, and only love self in
subserviency to him that is Lord of all. But those who
are declined from that love to God, are lovers of themselves
more than God: for supreme love must centre in
one of these two. To that inordinate self-love, the apostle
rightly joins proud and high-minded. (2 Tim. iii. 2, 4.)
For no sooner had the angels declined their love, duty and
reverence to God, than they inordinately loved and valued
themselves; which made them exceed their station, and
aspire above the order of their creation. This was their
pride, and this sad defection their dismal fall; who are
reserved in chains of darkness unto the judgment of the
great day of God.

II. Pride, that pernicious evil, which begins this
chapter, did also begin the misery of mankind: a most
mischievous quality; and so commonly known by its
motions and sad effects, that every unmortified breast
carries its definition in it. However, I will say, in short,
that pride is an excess of self-love, joined with an undervaluing
of others, and a desire of dominion over them:
the most troublesome thing in the world. There are four[77]
things by which it hath made itself best known to mankind,
the consequences of which have brought a misery
equal to its evil. The first is, an inordinate pursuit of
knowledge; the second, an ambitious craving and seeking
after power; the third, an extreme desire of personal
respect and deference: the last excess is that of worldly
furniture and ornaments. To the just and true witness of
the eternal God, placed in the souls of all people, I appeal
as to the truth of these things.

III. To the first, it is plain, that an inordinate desire of
knowledge introduced man's misery, and brought an universal
lapse from the glory of his primitive state. Adam
would needs be wiser than God had made him. It did
not serve his turn to know his Creator, and give him that
holy homage his being and innocency naturally engaged
and excited him too; nor to have an understanding above
all the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, and the
fishes of the sea, joined with a power to rule over all the
visible creation of God; but he must be as wise as God
too. This unwarrantable search, and as foolish as unjust
ambition, made him unworthy of the blessings he received
from God. This drives him out of paradise; and instead
of being lord of the whole world, Adam becomes the
wretchedest vagabond of the earth.

IV. The lamentable consequence of this great defection,
has been an exchange of innocency for guilt, and a paradise
for a wilderness. But, which is yet worse, in this
state Adam and Eve had got another god than the only
true and living God: and he that enticed them to all this
mischief, furnished them with a vain knowledge, and pernicious
wisdom: the skill of lies and equivocations, shifts,
evasions, and excuses. They had lost their plainness and
sincerity, and from an upright heart, the image in which
God had made man, he became a crooked, twining, twisting
serpent; the image of that unrighteous spirit, to whose[78]
temptations he yielded up, with his obedience, his paradisaical
happiness.

V. So that fallen Adam's knowledge of God stood no
more in a daily experience of the love and work of God
in his soul, but in a notion of what he once did know and
experience: which being not the true and living wisdom
that is from above, but a mere picture, it cannot preserve
man in purity; but puffs up, makes people proud, high-minded,
and impatient of contradiction. This was the
state of the apostate Jews before Christ came; and has
been the condition of apostate Christians ever since he
came: their religion standing, some bodily performances
excepted, either in what they once knew of the work of
God in themselves, and which they have revolted from;
or in an historical belief, and an imaginary conception
and paraphrase upon the experiences and prophecies of
such holy men and women of God, as in all ages have
deserved the style and character of his true children.

VI. As such a knowledge of God cannot be true, so by
experience we find, that it ever brings forth the quite
contrary fruits to the true wisdom. For as this "is first
pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated;"
(James, iii. 17;) so the knowledge of degenerated and unmortified
men is first impure: for it came by the commission
of evil, and is held in an evil and impure conscience
in them that disobey God's laws, and that daily do those
things which they ought not to do; and for which they
stand condemned before God's judgment-seat in the souls
of men: the light of whose presence searches the most
hidden things of darkness, the most secret thoughts, and
concealed inclinations of ungodly men. This is the
science, falsely so called: and as it is impure, so it is
unpeaceable, cross, and hard to be entreated; froward,
perverse, and persecuting; jealous that any should be
better than they, and hating and abusing those that are.

[79]

VII. It was this pride made Cain a murderer: (Gen.
iv. 8:) it is a spiteful quality; full of envy and revenge.
What! was not his religion and worship as good as his
brother's? He had all the exterior parts of worship; he
offered as well as Abel; and the offering of itself might
be as good: but it seems the heart that offered it was not.
So long ago did God regard the interior worship of the
soul. Well, what was the consequence of this difference?
Cain's pride stomached it: he could not bear to be outdone
by his brother. He grew wrathful, and resolved to
vindicate his offering by revenging the refusal of it upon
his brother's life: and without any regard to natural affection,
or the low and early condition of mankind, he barbarously
dyed his hands in his brother's blood.

VIII. The religion of the apostatized Jews did no
better; for, having lost the inward life, power, and spirit
of the law, they were puffed up with that knowledge they
had: and their pretences to Abraham, Moses, and the
promises of God, in that frame, served only to blow them
up into an insufferable pride, arrogancy, and cruelty.
For they could not bear true vision when it came to visit
them; and entertained the messengers of their peace as if
they had been wolves and tigers.

IX. Yea, it is remarkable, the false prophets, the great
engineers against the true ones, were ever sure to persecute
them as false; and, by their interest with earthly
princes, or the poor seduced multitude, made them the
instruments of their malice. Thus it was, that one holy
prophet was sawn asunder, another stoned to death, &amp;c.
So proud and obstinate is false knowledge, and the aspirers
after it; which made holy Stephen cry out, "Ye stiff-necked
and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always
resist the Holy Ghost: as did your fathers, so do ye."
(Acts, vii. 51.)

X. The true knowledge came with the joy of angels,[80]
singing, "Peace on earth, and good-will towards men;"
(Luke, ii. 14;) the false knowledge entertained the message
with calumnies: Christ must needs be an impostor;
and that must prove him so, to wit, his power of working
miracles; which was that which proved the contrary.
They frequently sought to kill him: which at last they
wickedly accomplished. But what was the chief motive
to it? Why, he cried out against their hypocrisy, the
broad phylacteries, the honour they sought of men. To
be short, they give the reason themselves in these words:
If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him:
that is, he will take away our credit with the people; they
will adhere to him, and desert us; and so we shall lose
our power and reputation with the multitude.

XI. And the truth is, he came to level their honour, to
overthrow their Rabbiship, and by his grace to bring the
people to that inward knowledge of God, which they, by
transgression, were departed from; that so they might see
the deceitfulness of their blind guides, who by their vain
traditions had made void the righteousness of the law:
and who were so far from being the true doctors and lively
expounders of it, that in reality they were the children of
the devil, who was a proud liar and cruel murderer from
the beginning.

XII. Their pride in false knowledge having made them
incapable of receiving the simplicity of the gospel, Christ
thanks his Father, that he had hid the mysteries of it from
the wise and prudent, and revealed them to babes. (Matt.
xi. 25.) It was this false wisdom swelled the minds of the
Athenians to that degree, that they despised the preaching
of the apostle Paul as a vain and foolish thing. But that
apostle who, of all the rest, had an education in the learning
of those times, bitterly reflects on that wisdom, so
much valued by Jews and Greeks; "Where," says he,
"is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer[81]
of this world? Hath not God made foolish the
wisdom of this world?" (1 Cor. i. 20.) And he gives a
good reason for it, "That no flesh should glory in his presence."
(Verse 29.) Which is to say, God will stain the
pride of man in false knowledge, that he should have
nothing on this occasion to be proud of: it should be
owing only to the revelation of the Spirit of God. The
apostle goes further, and affirms, "That the world by wisdom
knew not God:" (verse 21:) that is, it was so far
from a help, that as men use it, it was a hindrance to the
true knowledge of God. And in his first epistle to his
beloved Timothy, he concludes thus: "O Timothy! keep
that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and
vain babblings, and oppositions of science, falsely so
called." (Tim. vi. 20.) This was the sense of apostolical
times, when the divine grace gave the true knowledge of
God, and was the guide of Christians.

XIII. Well, but what has been the success of those
ages that followed the apostolical? Any whit better than
that of the Jewish times? Not one jot. They have
exceeded them; as with their pretences to greater knowledge,
so in their degeneracy from the true Christian life:
for though they had a more excellent pattern than the
Jews, to whom God spoke by Moses his servant, he
speaking to them by his beloved Son, the express image
of his substance, the perfection of all meekness and humility;
and though they seemed addicted to nothing more
than an adoration of his name, and a veneration for the
memory of his blessed disciples and apostles, yet so great
was their defection from the inward power and life of
Christianity in the soul, that their respect was little more
than formal and ceremonious. For notwithstanding they,
like the Jews, were mighty zealous in garnishing their
sepulchres, and curious in carving their images; not
only keeping with pretence what might be the relics of[82]
their persons, but recommending a thousand things as
relics, which are purely fabulous, and very often ridiculous,
and to be sure altogether unchristian; yet as to the
great and weighty things of the Christian law, viz. love,
meekness, and self-denial, they were degenerated. They
grew high-minded, proud, boasters, without natural affection,
curious, and controversial, ever perplexing the
church with doubtful questions; filling the people with
disputations, strife, and wrangling, drawing them into
parties, till at last they fell into blood: as if they had
been the worse for being once Christians.

O the miserable state of these pretended Christians!
that instead of Christ's and his apostles' doctrine, of loving
enemies, and blessing them that curse them, they should
teach the people, under the notion of Christian zeal, most
inhumanly to butcher one another; and instead of suffering
their own blood to be shed for the testimony of Jesus,
they should shed the blood of the witnesses of Jesus for
heretics. Thus that subtle serpent, or crafty evil spirit,
that tempted Adam out of innocency, and the Jews from
the law of God, has beguiled the Christians, by lying
vanities, to depart from the Christian law of holiness, and
so they are become slaves to him; for he rules in the
hearts of the children of disobedience.

XIV. And it is observable, that as pride, which is ever
followed by superstition and obstinacy, put Adam upon
seeking a higher station than God placed him in; and as
the Jews, out of the same pride, to outdo their pattern,
given them of God by Moses upon the mount, taught for
doctrines their own traditions, insomuch that those that
refused conformity to them, ran the hazard of Crucify,
crucify: so the nominal Christians, from the same sin of
pride, with great superstition and arrogance, have introduced,
instead of a spiritual worship and discipline, that
which is evidently ceremonious and worldly; with such[83]
innovations and traditions of men as are the fruit of the
wisdom that is from below; witness their numerous and
perplexed councils and creeds, with Conform or burn, at
the end of them.

XV. And as this unwarrantable pride set them first at
work, to pervert the spirituality of the Christian worship,
making it rather to resemble the shadowy religion of the
Jews, and the gaudy worship of the Egyptians, than the
great plainness and simplicity of the Christian institution,
which is neither to resemble that of the mountain, nor the
other of Jerusalem; so has the same pride and arrogancy
spurred them on, by all imaginable cruelties to maintain
this great Diana of theirs. No meek supplications, nor
humble remonstrances, of those that kept close to primitive
purity in worship and doctrine, could prevail with
these nominal Christians to dispense with the imposition
of their unapostolical traditions; but as the ministers and
bishops of these degenerate Christians left their painful
visitation and care over Christ's flock, and grew ambitious,
covetous, and luxurious, resembling rather worldly potentates,
than the humble-spirited and mortified followers of
the blessed Jesus; so almost every history tells us, with
what pride and cruelty, blood and butchery, and that with
unusual and exquisite tortures, they have persecuted the
holy members of Christ out of the world; and that upon
such anathemas, as far as they could, they have disappointed
them of the blessing of heaven too. These,
true Christians call martyrs; but the clergy, like the persecuting
Jews, have styled them blasphemers and heretics;
in which they have fulfilled the prophecy of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who did not say, that they should
think they do the gods good service to kill the Christians,
his dear followers, which might refer to the persecutions
of the idolatrous Gentiles; (John, xvi. 2;) but that they
should think they do God good service to kill them:[84]
which shows, that they should be such as professedly
owned the true God, as the apostate Christians have all
along pretended to do. So that they must be those
wolves, that the apostle foretold, should arise out of themselves,
and worry the flock of Christ, (Acts, xx. 29,) after the
great falling away should commence, that was foretold by
him, and made necessary, in order to the proving of the
faithful, and the revelation of the great mystery of iniquity.

I shall conclude this head with this assertion, that
it is too undeniable a truth, where the clergy have
been most in power and authority, and have had the
greatest influence upon princes and states, there have
been most confusions, wrangles, bloodshed, sequestrations,
imprisonments, and exiles: to the justifying of which I
call the testimony of the records of all times. How it is
in our age I leave to the experience of the living; yet
there is one demonstration that can hardly fail us; the
people are not converted, but debauched, to a degree that
time will not allow us an example. The worship of
Christendom is visible, ceremonious, and gaudy; the
clergy, ambitious of worldly preferments, under the pretence
of spiritual promotion; making the earthly revenues
of churchmen much the reason of their function; being
almost ever sure to leave the present smaller livings, to
solicit and obtain benefices of larger title and income. So
that with their pride and avarice, which good old Peter
foresaw would be their snares, they have drawn after them
ignorance, misery, and irreligion upon Christendom.

XVI. The way of recovery from this miserable defection
is to come to a saving knowledge of religion; that is,
an experience of the divine work of God in the soul: to
obtain which be diligent to obey the grace that appears
in thy soul, O man! that brings salvation; (Tit. ii. 2, 11,
12, 14;) it turns thee out of the broad way into the narrow
way; from thy lusts to thy duty; from sin to holiness;[85]
from Satan to God. Thou must see and abhor self: thou
must watch, and thou must pray, and thou must fast;
thou must not look at thy tempter, but at thy preserver;
avoid ill company, retire to thy solitudes, and be a chaste
pilgrim in this evil world: and thus thou wilt arrive at
the knowledge of God and Christ, that brings eternal life
to the soul: a well-grounded assurance from what a man
feels and knows within himself: such shall not be moved
with evil tidings.



[86]




CHAPTER VIII.



1. Pride craves power as well as knowledge.&mdash;2. The case of Korah,
&amp;c. a proof.&mdash;3. Absalom's ambition confirms it.&mdash;4. Nebuchadnezzar's
does the like.&mdash;5. The history of Pisistratus, Alexander,
Cæsar, &amp;c. shows the same thing.&mdash;6. The Turks are a
lively proof, who have shed much blood to gratify pride for power.&mdash;7.
The last ten years in Christendom exceed in proof of this.&mdash;8.
Ambition rests not in courts, it finds room in private breasts
too, and spoils families and societies.&mdash;9. Their peace is great
that limit their desires by God's grace, and having power, use it
to the good of others.


I. But let us see the next most common, eminent, and
mischievous effect of this evil. Pride does extremely
crave power, than which not one thing has proved more
troublesome and destructive to mankind. I need not
labour myself much in evidence of this, since most of the
wars of nations, depopulation of kingdoms, ruins of cities,
with the slavery and misery that have followed, both our
own experience and unquestionable histories, acquaint us
to have been the effect of ambition, which is the lust of
pride after power.

II. How specious soever might be the pretences of
Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, against Moses, it was their
emulation of his mighty power in the camp of Israel that
put them upon conspiracies and mutinies. They longed
for his authority, and their not having it was his crime:
for they had a mind to be the heads and leaders of the
people. The consequence of which was a remarkable[87]
destruction to themselves and all their unhappy accomplices.

III. Absalom, too, was for the people's rights against
the tyranny of his father and his king; (2 Sam. xv.;) at
least with this pretence he palliated his ambition; but his
rebellion showed he was impatient for power, and that he
resolved to sacrifice his duty as a son and subject to the
importunities of his restless pride; which brought a miserable
death to himself and an extraordinary slaughter upon
his army.

IV. Nebuchadnezzar is a lively instance of the excessive
lust of pride for power. His successes and empire
were too heady for him: so much too strong for his understanding,
that he forgot he did not make himself, or
that his power had a superior. He makes an image, and
all must bow to it, or be burnt. And when Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego refused to comply, "Who," says
he, "is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?"
(Dan. iii.) And notwithstanding the convictions he had
upon him, at the constancy of those excellent men, and
Daniel's interpretation of his dreams, it was not long
before the pride of his power had filled his heart, and then
his mouth, with this haughty question, "Is not this great
Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom,
by the might of my power, and for the honour of my
majesty?" (Dan. iv. 30.) But we are told, that while
the words were in his mouth, a voice from heaven rebuked
the pride of his spirit, and he was driven from the society
of men, to graze among the beasts of the field.

V. If we look into the histories of the world, we shall
find many instances to prove the mischief of this lust of
pride. I will mention a few of them for their sakes who
have either not read or considered them.

Solon made Athens free by his excellent constitution of
laws; but the ambition of Pisistratus began the ruin of it[88]
before his eyes. Alexander, not contented with his own
kingdom, invaded others, and filled with spoil and slaughter
those countries he subdued: and it was not ill said by
the man, who, when Alexander accused him of piracy,
told him to his face that Alexander was the greatest pirate
in the world. It was the same ambition that made Cæsar
turn traitor to his masters, and with their own army, put
into his hand for their service, subdue them to his yoke,
and usurp the government; which ended in the expulsion
of freedom and virtue together in that commonwealth; for
goodness quickly grew to be faction in Rome; and that
sobriety and wisdom which ever rendered her senators
venerable, became dangerous to their safety: insomuch
that his successors hardly left one they did not kill or
banish; unless such as turned to be flatterers of their
unjust acquisition, and the imitators of their debauched
manners.

VI. The Turks are a great proof to the point in hand,
who to extend their dominion, have been the cause of
shedding much blood, and laying many stately countries
waste.

And yet they are to be outdone by apostate Christians;
whose practice is therefore more condemnable, because
they have been better taught: they have had a master of
another doctrine and example. It is true, they call him
Lord still, but they let their ambition reign: they love
power more than one another; and to get it kill one another;
though charged by him not to strike, but to love
and serve one another. And, which adds to the tragedy,
all natural affection is sacrificed to the fury of this lust:
and therefore are stories so often stained with the murder
of parents, children, uncles, nephews, masters, &amp;c.

VII. If we look abroad into remoter parts of the world,
we shall rarely hear of wars; but in Christendom rarely of
peace. A very trifle is too often made a ground of quarrel[89]
here: nor can any league be so sacred or inviolable that
arts shall not be used to evade and dissolve it to increase
dominion. No matter who, nor how many are slain, made
widows and orphans, or lose their estates and livelihoods;
what countries are ruined; what towns and cities spoiled:
if by all these things the ambitious can but arrive at their
ends! To go no further back than sixty years, that little
period of time will furnish us with many wars begun upon
ill grounds, and ended in great desolation. Nay, the last
twelve years of our time make as pregnant a demonstration
as we can furnish ourselves with from the records of
any age. It is too tedious, nor is it my business, to be
particular: it has been often well observed by others, and
is almost known to all, I mean the French, Spanish, German,
English, and Dutch wars.

VIII. But ambition does not only dwell in courts and
senates: it is too natural to every private breast to strain
for power. We daily see how much men labour their
utmost wit and interest to be great, to get higher places,
or greater titles than they have, that they may look bigger
and be more acknowledged; take place of their former
equals, and so equal those that were once their superiors:
compel friends, and be revenged on enemies. This makes
Christianity so little loved of worldly men; its kingdom is
not of this world; and though they may speak it fair, it is
the world they love: that without uncharitableness we may
truly say, People profess Christianity, but they follow the
world. They are not for seeking the kingdom of heaven
first, and the righteousness thereof, (Matt. vi. 33,) and to
trust God with the rest; but for securing to themselves
the wealth and glory of this world, and adjourning the
care of salvation to a sick bed, and the extreme moments
of life; if yet they believe a life to come.

IX. To conclude this head; great is their peace, who
know a limit to their ambitious minds; that have learned[90]
to be contented with the appointments and bounds of
Providence: that are not careful to be great; but, being
great, are humble and do good. Such keep their wits
with their consciences, and, with an even mind, can at all
times measure the uneven world, rest fixed in the midst of
all its uncertainties, and as becomes those who have an
interest in a better, in the good time and will of God,
cheerfully leave this; when the ambitious, conscious of
their evil practices, and weighed down to their graves
with guilt, must go to a tribunal that they can neither awe
nor bribe.



[91]




CHAPTER IX.



1. The third evil effect of pride is love of honour and respect. Too
many are guilty of it.&mdash;2. It had like to have cost Mordecai dear.
Great mischief has befallen nations on this account.&mdash;3. The
world is out in the business of true honour, as well as in that of
true science.&mdash;4. Reasons why the author, and the rest of the
people he walks with, use not these fashions.&mdash;5. The first is, the
sense they had in the hour of their conviction, of the unsuitableness
of them to the Christian spirit and practice, and that the
root they came from was pride and self-love.&mdash;6. Reproach could
not move them from that sense and practice accordingly.&mdash;7. They
do it not to make sects, or for distinction.&mdash;8. Nor yet to countenance
formality, but passively let drop vain customs, and so are
negative to forms.&mdash;9. Their behaviour is a test upon the world.&mdash;10.
And this cross to the world a test upon them.&mdash;11. The
second reason against them is their emptiness.&mdash;12. Honour in
Scripture is not so taken as it is in the world. It is used for
obedience.&mdash;13. It is used for preferments.&mdash;14. A digression
about folly in a Scripture sense.&mdash;15. Honour is used for reputation.&mdash;16.
Honour is also attributed to functions and capacities,
by way of esteem.&mdash;17. Honour is taken for help and countenance
of inferiors.&mdash;18. Honour is used for service and esteem to
all states and capacities: honour all men.&mdash;19. Yet there is a
limitation, in a sense, to the righteous, by the Psalmist; to
honour the godly, and contemn the wicked.&mdash;20. Little of this
honour found in the world's fashions.&mdash;21. The third reason
against them is, they mock and cheat people of the honour due
to them.&mdash;22. The author and his friends are for true honour.&mdash;23.
The fourth reason is, that if the fashions carried true honour
in them, the debauched could honour men, which cannot be.&mdash;24.
The fifth reason is, that then men of spite, hypocrisy, and
revenge, could pay honour, which is impossible.&mdash;25. The sixth
reason is drawn from the antiquity of true honour.&mdash;26. The
seventh reason is from the rise of the vain honour, and the[92]
teachers of it, wherein the clown, upon a comparison, excels the
courtier for a man of breeding.&mdash;27. The eighth reason against
these honours is, that they may be had for money, which true
honour cannot be.&mdash;28. The ninth and last reason is, because the
holy Scripture expressly forbids them to true Christians.&mdash;29. As
in the case of Mordecai.&mdash;30. A passage between a bishop and
the author in this matter.&mdash;31. Likewise the case of Elihu in Job.&mdash;32.
Also the doctrine of Christ to his disciples.&mdash;33. Paul
against conforming to the world's fashions.&mdash;34. Peter against
fashioning ourselves according to the world's lusts.&mdash;35. James
against respect to persons.&mdash;36. Yet Christians are civil and mannerly
in a right way.&mdash;37. But unlike the world in the nature of
it, and motives to it.&mdash;38. Testimonies in favour of our dissent
and practice.


I. The third evil effect of pride, is an excessive desire of
personal honour and respect.

Pride, therefore loves power, that she might have
homage, and that every one may give her honour, and
such as are wanting in that, expose themselves to her
anger and revenge. And as pride, so this evil effect is
more or less diffused through corrupt mankind; and has
been the occasion of great animosity, and mischief in the
world.

II. We have a pregnant instance in holy writ, what
malice and revenge proud man is capable of, when not
gratified in this particular. It had almost cost Mordecai
his neck, and the whole people of the Jews their lives,
because he would not bow himself to Haman, who was a
great favourite to king Ahasuerus. And the practice of
the world, even in our own age, will tell us, that not
striking a flag or sail, and not saluting certain ports or
garrisons, yea, less things have given rise to mighty wars
between states and kingdoms, to the expense of much
treasure, but more blood. The like has followed about
the precedency of princes and their ambassadors. Also
the envy, quarrels, and mischiefs that have happened
among private persons, upon conceit that they have not[93]
been respected to their degree or quality among men,
without hat, knee, or title: to be sure, duels and murders
not a few. I was once myself in France[3] set upon about
eleven at night, as I was walking to my lodging, by a
person that waylaid me, with his naked sword in his
hand, who demanded satisfaction of me for taking no
notice of him, at a time when he civilly saluted me with
his hat; though the truth was, I saw him not when he
did it. I will suppose he had killed me, for he made
several passes at me, or I, in my defence, had killed him,
when I disarmed him, as the earl of Crawford's servant
saw, that was by; I ask any man of understanding or conscience,
if the whole ceremony was worth the life of a
man, considering the dignity of the nature, and the importance
of the life of man, both with respect to God his
Creator, himself, and the benefit of civil society.

III. But the truth is, the world, under its degeneracy
from God, is as much out of the way as to true honour
and respect, as in other things; for mere shows, and those
vain ones, too, are much of the honour and respect that
are expressed in the world; that a man may say concerning
them, as the apostle speaks of science, that is, they
are honours and respects falsely so called; having nothing
of the nature of true honour and respect in them: but as
degenerate men, loving to be honoured, first devised them,
so pride only loves and seeks them, and is affronted and
angry for want of them. Did men know a true Christian
state, and the honour that comes from above, which
JESUS teaches, they would not covet these very vanities,
much less insist upon them.

IV. And here give me leave to set down the reasons
more particularly, why I, and the people with whom I
walk in religious society, have declined, as vain and foolish,
several worldly customs and fashions of respect, much[94]
in request at this time of day: and I beseech thee, reader,
to lay aside all prejudice and scorn, and with the meekness
and inquiry of a sober and discreet mind, read and
weigh what may be here alleged in our defence: and if we
are mistaken, rather pity and inform, than despise and
abuse our simplicity.

V. The first and most pressing motive upon our spirits,
to decline the practice of these present customs, pulling
off the hat, bowing the body or knee, and giving people
gaudy titles and epithets in our salutations and addresses,
was that savour, sight and sense of God, by his light and
Spirit given us, of the Christian world's apostacy from
God, and the cause and effects of that great and lamentable
defection. In the discovery of which the sense of our
state came first before us, and we were made to see him
whom we pierced, and to mourn for it. A day of humiliation
overtook us, and we fainted to that pleasure and
delight we once loved. Now our works went beforehand
to judgment, and a thorough search was made, and the
words of the prophet became well understood by us;
"Who can abide the day of his coming? and who shall
stand when he appears?" "He is like a refiner's fire,
and like fullers' soap." (Mal. iii. 2.) And as the apostle
said, "If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the
ungodly and the sinner appear?" (1 Peter, iv. 18.)
"Wherefore," says the apostle Paul, "knowing the terror
of the Lord, we persuade men:" (2 Cor. v. 11:) what to
do? To come out of the nature, spirit, lusts, and customs
of this wicked world: remembering that, as Jesus has
said, "For every idle word that man shall speak, he shall
give account thereof in the day of judgment." (Matt.
xii. 36.)

This concern of mind and dejection of spirit was visible
to our neighbours; and we are not ashamed to own, that
the terrors of the Lord took such hold upon us, because[95]
we had long, under a profession of religion, grieved God's
Holy Spirit, that reproved us in secret for our disobedience;
that as we abhorred to think of continuing in our old sins,
so we feared to use lawful things, lest we should use them
unlawfully. Our heaven seemed to melt away, and our
earth to be removed out of its place; and we were like
men, as the apostle said, upon whom the ends of the
world were come. God knows it was so in this day; the
brightness of his coming to our souls discovered, and the
breath of his mouth destroyed every plant he had not
planted in us. He was a swift witness against every evil
thought and every unfruitful work; and, blessed be his
name, we were not offended in him, or at his righteous
judgments. Now it was that a grand inquest came upon
our whole life: every word, thought, and deed was
brought to judgment, the root examined, and its tendency
considered. "The lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh,
and the pride of life," (1 John, ii. 16,) were opened to our
view; the mystery of iniquity in us. And by knowing
the evil leaven, and its divers evil effects in ourselves,
how it had wrought, and what it had done, we came to
have a sense and knowledge of the states of others: and
what we could not, nay, we dare not let live and continue
in ourselves, as being manifested to us to proceed from an
evil principle in the time of man's degeneracy, we could
not comply with in others. Now this I say, and that in
the fear and presence of the all-seeing, just God, the present
honours and respect of the world, among other things,
became burdensome to us: we saw they had no being
in paradise, that they grew in the night-time, and came
from an ill root; and that they only delighted a vain and
ill mind, and that much pride and folly were in them.

VI. And though we easily foresaw the storms of reproach
that would fall upon us for our refusing to practise
them; yet we were so far from being shaken in our judgment,[96]
that it abundantly confirmed our sense of them. For
so exalted a thing is man, and so loving of honour and
respect, even from his fellow-creatures, that so soon as in
tenderness of conscience towards God we could not perform
them as formerly, he became more concerned than
for all the rest of our differences, however material to salvation.
So that let the honour of God and our own salvation
do as it will, it was greater heresy and blasphemy to
refuse him the homage of the hat, and his usual titles of
honour; to deny to pledge his healths, or play with him
at cards and dice, than any other principle we maintained:
for being less in his view, it seemed not so much in his
way.

VII. And though it be frequently objected that we seek
to set up outward forms of preciseness, and that is but as
a green riband, the badge of the party, the better to be
known: I do declare, in the fear of Almighty God, that
these are but the imaginations and vain constructions of
insensible men, that have not had that sense which the
Lord hath given us, of what arises from the right and the
wrong root in man: and when such censurers of our simplicity
shall be inwardly touched and awakened by the
mighty power of God, and see things as they are in their
proper natures and seeds, they will then know their own
burden, and easily acquit us, without the imputation of
folly or hypocrisy herein.

VIII. To say that we strain at small things, which becomes
not people of so fair pretensions to liberty and
freedom of spirit: I answer with meekness, truth, and
sobriety; first, nothing is small that God makes matter of
conscience to do, or leave undone. Next as inconsiderable
as they are made, by those that object upon us, they
are much set by; so greatly as for our not giving them to
be beaten, imprisoned, refused justice, &amp;c. To say nothing
of the derision and reproach that hath been frequently[97]
flung at us on this account. So that if we had
wanted a proof of the truth of our inward belief and judgment,
the very practice of them that opposed it would
have abundantly confirmed us. But let it suffice to us,
that "Wisdom is justified of her children:" (Matt. xi. 19:)
we only passively let fall the practice of what we are
taught to believe is vain and unchristian: in which we
are negative to forms: for we leave off, we do not set up
forms.

IX. The world is so set upon the ceremonious parts and
outside of things, that it has well beseemed the wisdom of
God in all ages to bring forth his dispensations with very
different appearances to their settled customs; thereby contradicting
human inventions, and proving the integrity of
his confessors. Nay, it is a test upon the world: it tries
what patience, kindness, sobriety, and moderation they
have: if the rough and homely outside of truth stumble
not their minds from the reception of it, whose beauty is
within: it makes a great discovery upon them. For he
who refuses a precious jewel, because it is presented in a
plain box, will never esteem it to its value, nor set his
heart upon keeping it; therefore I call it a test, because it
shows where the hearts and affections of the people stick,
after all their great pretence to more excellent things.

X. It is also a mighty trial upon God's people, in that
they are put upon the discovery of their contradiction to
the customs generally received and esteemed in the world;
which exposes them to the wonder, scorn, and abuse of
the multitude. But there is a hidden treasure in it: it
inures us to reproach, it teaches us to despise the false
reputation of the world, and silently to undergo the contradiction
and scorn of its votaries; and finally with a
Christian meekness and patience to overcome their injuries
and reproaches. Add to this; it weans thee of thy
familiars; for being slighted of them as a ninny, a fool, a[98]
frantic, &amp;c. thou art delivered from a greater temptation;
and that is the power and influence of their vain conversation.
And last of all, it lists thee of the company of the
blessed, mocked, persecuted JESUS: to fight under his
banner against the world, the flesh, and the devil: that
after having faithfully suffered with him in a state of
humiliation, thou mayst reign with him in a state of glorification:
who glorifies his poor, despised, constant followers
with the glory he had with the Father before the
world began. (John, xvii. 5.) This was the first reason
of our declining to practise the before-mentioned honours,
respect, &amp;c.

XI. The second reason why we decline and refuse the
present use of these customs in our addresses and salutations,
is from the consideration of their very emptiness
and vanity: that there is nothing of true honour and
respect in them, supposing them not to be evil. And, as
religion and worship are degenerated into form and ceremony,
and they not according to primitive practice neither,
so is honour and respect too; there being little of that in
the world as well as of the other; and to be sure, in
these customs, none that is justifiable by Scripture or
reason.

XII. In Scripture we find the word honour often and
diversely used. First for obedience: as when God saith,
"They that honour me;" (1 Sam. ii. 30:) that is, that
keep my commandments. "Honour the king;" (1 Pet.
ii. 17;) that is, obey the king. "Honour thy father and
mother;" (Exod. xx. 12;) that is, saith the apostle to the
Ephesians, "Obey thy father and thy mother in the Lord,
for that is right:" (Eph. vi. 1, 2:) take heed to their precepts
and advice: presupposing always, that rulers and
parents command lawful things, else they dishonour themselves
to enjoin unlawful things; and subjects and children
dishonour their superiors and parents, in complying[99]
with their unrighteous commands. Also Christ uses this
word so, when he says, "I have not a devil, but I honour
my Father, and ye dishonour me;" (John, viii. 49;) that is,
I do my Father's will in what I do, but you will not hear
me; you reject my counsel, and will not obey my voice.
It was not refusing hat and knee, nor empty trifles: no,
it was disobedience; resisting him that God had sent,
and not believing in him. This was the dishonour he
taxed them with; using him as an impostor, that God
had ordained for the salvation of the world. And of these
dishonourers there are but too many at this day. Christ
has a saying to the same effect; "That all men should
honour the Son, even as they honour the Father; and he
that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father,
which hath sent him:" (John, v. 23:) that is, they that
hearken not to Christ, and do not worship and obey him,
they do not hear, worship, nor obey God. As they pretended
to believe in God, so they were to have believed in
him; he told them so. This is pregnantly manifested in
the case of the centurion, whose faith was so much commended
by Christ; where, giving Jesus an account of his
honourable station, he tells him, "He had soldiers under
his authority, and when he said to one, Go, he went; to
another, Come, he came; and to a third, Do this, he did
it." (Luke, vii. 8.) In this it was he placed the honour
of his capacity, and the respect of his soldiers, and not in
hats and legs: nor are such customs yet in use amongst
soldiers, being effeminate, and unworthy of masculine
gravity.

XIII. In the next place, honour is used for preferment
to trust and eminent employments. So the Psalmist,
speaking to God: "For thou hast crowned him with glory
and honour:" again, "Honour and majesty hast thou laid
on him;" (Psalm viii. 5; xxi. 5;) that is, God hath given
Christ power over all his enemies, and exalted him to[100]
great dominion. Thus the wise man intimates, when he
says, "The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom,
and before honour is humility." (Prov. xv. 33.) That is,
before advancement or preferment is humility. Further,
he has this saying, "As snow in summer, and as rain in
harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool:" (Prov. xxvi.
10:) that is, a fool is not capable of the dignity of trust,
employment, or preferment: they require virtue, wisdom,
integrity, diligence, with which fools are unfurnished.
And yet if the respects and titles in use amongst us are to
go for marks of honour, Solomon's proverb will take place,
and doubtless doth, upon the practice of this age, that
yields so much of that honour to a great many of Solomon's
fools; who are not only silly men, but wicked too;
such as refuse instruction, and hate the fear of the Lord;
(Prov. xiii. 18;) which only maketh one of his wise
men.

XIV. And as virtue and wisdom are the same, so folly
and wickedness. Thus Shechem's lying with Dinah,
Jacob's daughter, is called: (Gen. xxxiv. 7:) so is the
rebellion and wickedness of the Israelites in Joshua.
(Josh. vii. 15.) The Psalmist expresses thus: "My
wounds stink, because of my foolishness:" (Psalm
xxxviii. 5:) that is, his sin. And, "The Lord will speak
peace to his saints, but let them not turn again to folly:"
(Psalm lxxxv. 8:) that is, to evil. "His own iniquities,"
says Solomon, "shall take the wicked himself, and he
shall be holden with the cords of his sins: he shall die
without instruction, and in the greatness of his folly he
shall go astray." (Prov. v. 22, 23.) Christ puts foolishness
with blasphemy, pride, theft, murders, adulteries,
wickedness, &amp;c. (Mark, vii. 10-12.) I was the more
willing to add these passages, to show the difference that
there is between the mind of the Holy Ghost, and the
notion that those ages had of fools, that deserve not[101]
honour, and that which is generally meant by fools and
folly in our time; that we may the better understand the
disproportion there is between honour, as then understood
by the Holy Ghost, and those that were led thereby;
and the apprehension of it, and the practice of those
latter ages of professed Christians.

XV. But honour is also taken for reputation, and it is
so understood with us: "A gracious woman," says Solomon,
"retaineth honour;" (Prov. xi. 16;) that is, she
keeps her credit: and by her virtue, maintains her reputation,
of sobriety and chastity. In another place, "It is
an honour for a man to cease from strife:" (Prov. xx. 3:)
that is, it makes for his reputation, as a wise and good
man. Christ uses the word thus, where he says, "A
prophet is not without honour, save in his own country;"
(Matt. xiii. 57;) that is, he has credit, and is valued, save
at home. The apostle to the Thessalonians has a saying
to this effect: "That every one of you should know how
to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour:" (1 Thes.
iv. 4:) that is, in chastity and sobriety. In all which
nothing of the fashions by us declined is otherwise concerned
than to be totally excluded.

XVI. There is yet another use of the word honour in
Scripture, and that is to functions and capacities: as, "An
elder is worthy of double honour:" (1 Tim. v. 17:) that
is, he deserves double esteem, love, and respect; being
holy, merciful, temperate, peaceable, humble, &amp;c., especially
one that labours in word and doctrine. So Paul recommends
Epaphroditus to the Philippians; "Receive him
therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such in
reputation:" (Phil. ii. 29:) as if he had said, Let them be
valued and regarded by you in what they say and teach.
Which is the truest, and most natural and convincing way
of testifying respect to a man of God; as Christ said to
his disciples, "If ye love me ye will keep my sayings."[102]
Further, the apostle bids us, To honour widows indeed:
that is, such women who are of chaste lives and exemplary
virtue are honourable.

XVII. The word honour, in the Scripture, is also used
from superiors to inferiors. Which is plain in the instance
of Ahasuerus to Haman; "What shall be done to the
man whom the king delighteth to honour?" (Esther, vi. 6.)
Why, he mightily advanced him, as Mordecai afterwards.
And more particularly it is said, that "the Jews had light,
and gladness, and joy, and honour:" (Esther, viii. 16:)
that is, they escaped the persecution that was like to fall
upon them, and by the means of Esther and Mordecai,
they enjoyed not only peace, but favour and countenance
too. In this sense the apostle Peter advised Christian
men "To honour their wives:" (1 Pet. iii. 7:) that is, to
love, value, cherish, countenance, and esteem them, for
their fidelity and affection to their husbands, for their
tenderness and care over their children, and for their diligence
and circumspection in their families. There is no
ceremonious behaviour, or gaudy titles requisite to express
this honour. Thus God honours holy men: "Them that
honour me," says the Lord, "I will honour; and they
that despise me shall be lightly esteemed:" (1 Sam. ii. 30:)
that is, I will do good to them, I will love, bless, countenance,
and prosper them that honour me, that obey me:
but they that despise me, that resist my Spirit, and break
my law, they shall be lightly esteemed, little set by or
accounted of; they shall not find favour with God, nor
righteous men. And so we see it daily among men: if
the great visit or concern themselves to aid the poor; we
say, that such a great man did me the honour to come
and see, or help me in my need.

XVIII. I shall conclude this with one passage more,
and that is a very large, plain, and pertinent one:
"Honour all men, and love the brotherhood:" (1 Pet.[103]
ii. 17:) that is, love is above honour, and that is reserved
for the brotherhood. But honour, which is esteem and
regard, that thou owest to all men; and if all, then thy
inferiors. But why for all men? Because they are the
creation of God, and the most noble part of his creation
too: they are also thy own kind: be natural, and assist
them with what thou canst; be ready to perform any real
respect, and yield them any good or countenance thou
canst.

XIX. And yet there seems a limitation to the command,
Honour all men, in that passage of godly David, "Who
shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy
hill? he in whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but
he honoureth them that fear the Lord." (Psalm xv. 1, 4.)
Here honour is confined and affixed to godly persons;
and dishonour made the duty of the righteous to the
wicked, and a mark of their being righteous, that they
dishonour, that is, slight or disregard them. To conclude
this Scripture inquiry after honour, I shall contract the
subject of it under three capacities, superiors, equals, and
inferiors: honour, to superiors is obedience; to equals,
love; to inferiors, countenance and help: that is honour
after God's mind, and the holy people's fashion of old.

XX. But how little of all this is to be seen or had in a
poor empty hat, bow, cringe, or gaudy, flattering title, let
the truth-speaking witness of God in all mankind judge.
For I must not appeal to corrupt, proud, and self-speaking
man, of the good or evil of those customs; that as little
as he would render them, are loved and sought by him,
and he is out of humour and angry if he has them not.

This is our second reason why we refuse to practise the
accustomed ceremonies of honour and respect; because
we find no such notion or expression of honour and respect,
recommended to us by the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures
of truth.

[104]

XXI. Our third reason for not using them as testimonies
of honour and respect is, because there is no discovery
of honour or respect to be made by them: it is
rather eluding and equivocating it; cheating people of the
honour and respect that is due to them; giving them
nothing in the show of something. There is in them no
obedience to superiors, no love to equals, no help or countenance
to inferiors.

XXII. We are, we declare to the whole world, for true
honour and respect; we honour the king, our parents, our
masters, our magistrates, our landlords, one another; yea,
all men, after God's way, used by holy men and women of
old time: but we refuse these customs as vain and deceitful;
not answering the end they are used for.

XXIII. But, fourthly, there is yet more to be said: we
find that vain, loose, and worldly people are the great
lovers and practisers of them, and most deride our simplicity
of behaviour. Now we assuredly know, from the
sacred testimonies, that those people cannot give true
honour that live in a dishonourable spirit; they understand
it not; but they can give the hat and knee, and that
they are very liberal of, nor are any more expert at it.
This is to us a proof that no true honour can be testified
by those customs, which vanity and looseness love and
use.

XXIV. Next to them I will add hypocrisy, and revenge
too. For how little do many care for each other! Nay,
what spite, envy, animosity, secret backbiting, and plotting
one against another, under the use of these idle
respects; till passion, too strong for cunning, breaks
through hypocrisy into open affront and revenge! It
cannot be so with the Scripture honour: to obey, or
prefer a man, out of spite, is not usually done: and to love,
help, serve, and countenance a person, in order to deceive
and be revenged of him, is a thing never heard of: these[105]
admit of no hypocrisy nor revenge. Men do not these
things to palliate ill-will, which are the testimonies of
quite the contrary. It is absurd to imagine it, because
impossible to be done.

XXV. Our sixth reason is, that honour was from the
beginning: but hat-respects and most titles are of late:
therefore there was true honour before hats or titles; and
consequently true honour stands not in them. And that
which ever was the way to express true honour is the best
way still; and this the Scripture teaches better than
dancing-masters can do.

XXVI. Seventhly, if honour consists in such-like ceremonies,
then will it follow, that they are most capable of
showing honour who perform it most exactly, according
to the mode or fashion of the times; consequently, that
man hath not the measure of true honour, from a just and
reasonable principle in himself, but by the means and
skill of the fantastic dancing-masters of the times: and
for this cause it is we see that many give much money to
have their children learn their honours, falsely so called.
And what doth this but totally exclude the poor country
people; who, though they plough, till, sow, reap, go to
market, and in all things obey their justices, landlords,
fathers, and masters, with sincerity and sobriety, rarely
use those ceremonies; but if they do it is so awkwardly
and meanly, that they are esteemed by a court critic so ill
favoured as only fit to make a jest of and be laughed at:
but what sober man will not deem their obedience beyond
the others' vanity and hypocrisy? This base notion of
honour turns out of doors the true, and sets the false in its
place. Let it be further considered, that the way or
fashion of doing it is much more in the design of its performers,
as well as view of its spectators, than the respect
itself. Whence it is commonly said, He is a man of good
mien; or, She is a woman of exact behaviour. And what[106]
is this behaviour but fantastic, cramped postures and
cringings, unnatural to their shape; and, if it were not
fashionable, ridiculous to the view of all people; and is
therefore to the Eastern countries a proverb.

XXVII. But yet, eighthly, real honour consists not in
a hat, bow, or title, because all these things may be had for
money, for which reason, how many dancing-schools,
plays, &amp;c. are there in the land, to which youth is generally
sent to be educated in these vain fashions! Whilst
they are ignorant of the honour that is of God, and their
minds are allured to visible things that perish; and instead
of remembering their Creator, are taken up with toys and
fopperies; and sometimes so much worse, as to cost
themselves a disinheriting, and their indiscreet parents
grief and misery all their days. (Prov. iii. 9.) If parents
would honour God in the help of his poor with the substance
they bestow on such an education, they would find
a far better account in the end.

XXVIII. But lastly, we cannot esteem bows, titles, and
pulling off of hats, to be real honour, because such-like
customs have been prohibited by God, his Son, and servants
in days past. This I shall endeavour to show by
three or four express authorities.

XXIX. My first example and authority is taken from
the story of Mordecai and Haman; so close to this point,
that methinks it should at least command silence to the
objections frequently advanced against us. Haman was
first minister of state, and favourite to king Ahasuerus.
The text says, That the king set his seat above all the
princes that were with him; and all the king's servants
bowed and reverenced Haman; for the king had so commanded
concerning him; but Mordecai, it seems, bowed
not, nor did him reverence. (Esther, iii. 1, 2.) This at
first made ill for Mordecai; a gallows was prepared for
him at Haman's command. But the sequel of the story[107]
shows that Haman proved his own invention, and ended
his pride with his life upon it. Well now, speaking as
the world speaks, and looking upon Mordecai without the
knowledge of the success; was not Mordecai a very
clown, at least a silly, morose, and humorous man, to run
such a hazard for a trifle? What hurt had it done him
to have bowed to and honoured one the king honoured?
Did he not despise the king, in disregarding Haman?
Nay, had not the king commanded that respect; and are
not we to honour and obey the king? One would have
thought he might have bowed for the king's sake, whatever
he had in his heart, and yet have come off well
enough; for that he bowed not merely to Haman, but to
the king's authority; besides, it was but an innocent
ceremony. But it seems Mordecai was too plain and
stout, and not fine and subtle enough to avoid the displeasure
of Haman.

Howbeit, he was an excellent man: he feared God, and
wrought righteousness. And in this very thing also he
pleased God, and even the king too, at last, that had most
cause to be angry with him: for he advanced him to
Haman's dignity; and if it could be to greater honour.
It is true, sad news first came; no less than destruction
to Mordecai, and the whole people of the Jews besides, for
his sake: but Mordecai's integrity and humiliation, his fasting,
and strong cries to God prevailed, and the people were
saved, and poor condemned Mordecai comes, after all, to
be exalted above the princes, whether in this or any other
respect. They that endure faithful in that which they are
convinced God requires of them, though against the grain
and humour of the world and themselves too, they shall
find a blessed recompense in the end. My brethren, remember
the cup of cold water: "We shall reap if we
faint not." And call to mind, that our Captain bowed
not to him that told him, "If thou wilt fall down and[108]
worship me, I will give thee all the glory of the world:"
shall we bow then? O no! Let us follow our blessed
Leader.

XXX. But before I leave this section, it is fit I add,
that in conference with a late bishop, and none of the
least eminent, upon this subject and instance, I remember
he sought to evade it thus: "Mordecai," says he, "did
not refuse to bow, as it was a testimony of respect to the
king's favourite; but he, being a figure and type of Christ,
refused, because Haman was of the uncircumcision, and
ought to bow to him rather." To which I replied, That
allowing Mordecai to be a figure of Christ, and the Jews
of God's people or church; and that as the Jews were
saved by Mordecai, so the church is saved by Christ;
this makes for me; for then, by that reason, the spiritual
circumcision, or people of Christ, are not to receive and
bow to the fashions and customs of the spiritual uncircumcision,
who are the children of the world; of which
such as were condemnable so long ago in the time of the
type and figure, can by no means be justifiably received
or practised in the time of the antitype or substance itself.
On the contrary, this shows expressly, we are faithfully to
decline such worldly customs, and not to fashion ourselves
according to the conversation of earthly-minded people;
but be renewed and changed in our ways, and keep close
to our Mordecai; who having not bowed, we must not
bow, that are his people and followers. And whatever be
our sufferings or reproaches, they will have an end: Mordecai,
our captain, that appears for his people throughout
all the provinces, in the king's gate, will deliver us at last;
and, for his sake, we shall be favoured and loved of the
king himself too. So powerful is faithful Mordecai at last.
Therefore let us all look to Jesus, our Mordecai, the Israel
indeed; He that has power with God, and would not bow
in the hour of temptation, but has mightily prevailed;[109]
and therefore is a Prince for ever, and "of his government
there shall be no end." (Isa. ix. 7.)

XXXI. The next Scripture instance I urge against
these customs, is a passage in Job, thus expressed: "Let
me not, I pray you, accept any man's person; neither let
me give flattering titles unto man, for I know not to give
flattering titles; in so doing, my Maker would soon take
me away." (Job, xxxii. 21, 22.) The question that will
arise upon the allegation of this Scripture is this, viz.
What titles are flattering? The answer is as obvious,
namely, Such as are empty and fictitious, and make him
more than he is: as to call a man what he is not, to
please him; or to exalt him beyond his true name, office,
or desert, to gain upon his affections; who, it may be,
lusteth to honour and respect: such as these,&mdash;most excellent,
most sacred, your grace, your lordship, most dread
majesty, right honourable, right worshipful, may it please
your majesty, your grace, your lordship, your honour, your
worship, and the like unnecessary titles and attributes,
calculated only to please and tickle poor, proud, vain, yet
mortal man. Likewise to call man what he is not, as my
lord, my master, &amp;c., and wise, just, or good, when he is
neither, only to please him, or show him respect.

It was familiar thus to do among the Jews, under their
degeneracy; wherefore one came to Christ, and said,
"Good master, what shall I do to have eternal life?"
(Luke, xviii. 18.) It was a salutation or address of respect
in those times. It is familiar now: good my lord, good
sir, good master, do this, or do that. But what was
Christ's answer? how did he take it? "Why callest thou
me good?" says Christ; "there is none good, save one,
that is God." (Verse 19.) He rejected it that had more
right to keep it than all mankind: and why? Because
there was one greater than he; and that he saw the man
addressed it to his manhood, after the way of the times,[110]
and not to his divinity which dwelt within it: therefore
Christ refuses it, showing and instructing us that we
should not give such epithets and titles commonly to men;
for good being due alone to God and godliness, it can
only be said in flattery to fallen man, and therefore sinful
to be so said.

This plain and exact life well became Him, that was on
purpose manifested to return and restore man from his
lamentable degeneracy, to the innocency and purity of his
first creation; who has taught us to be careful how we
use and give attributes unto man by that most severe saying,
"That every idle word that man shall speak, he shall
give an account thereof in the day of judgment." (Matt.
xii. 3, 6.) And that which should warn all men of the
latitude they take herein, and sufficiently justifies our
tenderness is this, That man can scarcely commit greater
injury and offence against Almighty God, than to ascribe
any of his attributes unto man, the creature of his word,
and the work of his hands. He is a jealous God of his
honour, and will not give his glory unto another. Besides,
it is so near the sin of the aspiring fallen angels,
that affected to be greater and better than they were made
and stated by the great Lord of all, and to entitle man to
a station above his make and orb, looks so like idolatry
(the unpardonable sin under the law) that it is hard to
think how men and women professing Christianity, and
seriously reflecting upon their vanity and evil in these
things, can continue in them, much less plead for them;
and least of all reproach and deride those that through
tenderness of conscience cannot use and give them. It
seems that Elihu did not dare to do it; but put such
weight upon the matter as to give this for one reason for
his forbearance, to wit, lest my Maker should soon take
me away: that is, for fear God should strike me dead, I
dare not give man titles that are above him, or titles[111]
merely to please him. I may not, by any means, gratify
that spirit which lusteth after such things. God is to be
exalted, and man abased. God is jealous of man's being
set higher than his station: he will have him keep his
place, know his original, and remember the rock from
whence he came: that what he has is borrowed; not his
own but his Maker's, who brought him forth and sustained
him; which man is very apt to forget: and lest I should
be accessory to it by flattering titles, instead of telling him
truly and plainly what he is, and using them as he ought
to be treated, and thereby provoke my Maker to displeasure,
and he in his anger and jealousy should take me
soon away, or bring sudden death and an untimely end
upon me, I dare not use, I dare not give such titles unto
men.

XXXII. But if we had not this to allege from the Old
Testament writings, it should and ought to suffice with
Christians, that these customs are severely censured by the
great Lord and Master of their religion; who is so far
from putting people upon giving honour one to another,
that he will not indulge them in it, whatever be the customs
of the country they live in: for he charges it upon
the Jews as a mark of their apostasy; "How can ye
believe which receive honour one of another, and seek not
the honour that cometh from God only?" where their
infidelity concerning Christ is made the effect of seeking
worldly, and not heavenly honour only. And the thing
is not hard to apprehend, if we consider that self-love and
desire of honour from men is inconsistent with the love
and humility of Christ. They sought the good opinion
and respect of the world; how then was it possible they
should leave all and follow him, whose kingdom is not of
this world; and that came in a way so cross to the mind
and humour of it? And that this was the meaning of our
Lord Jesus is plain: for he tells us what that honour was[112]
they gave and received, which he condemned them for,
and of which he bid the disciples of his humility and cross
beware. His words are these, and he speaks them not of
the rabble but of the doctors, the great men, the men of
honour among the Jews: "They love," says he, "the
uppermost rooms at feasts," (Matt. xxiii. 6,) "that is,
places of greatest rank and respect; and greetings,"
(Mark, xii. 38,) that is, salutations of respect, such as
pulling off the hat, and bowing the body are in our age, in
the market-places, viz. in the places of note and concourse,
the public walks and exchanges of the country.
And lastly, "they love," says Christ, "to be called of men,
Rabbi, Rabbi:" one of the most eminent titles among the
Jews. A word comprehending an excellency equal to
many titles: it may stand for your grace, your lordship,
right reverend father, &amp;c. It is upon these men of breeding
and quality that he pronounces his woes, making these
practices some of the evil marks by which to know them,
as well as some of the motives of his threatenings against
them. But he leaves it not here: he pursues this very
point of honour above all the rest in his caution to his
disciples; to whom he gave in charge thus: "But be not
ye called Rabbi; for one is your Master, even Christ, and
all ye are brethren." (Matt. xviii. 8, 10-12.) "Neither
be ye called Masters; but he that is greatest amongst you
shall be your servant: and whoever shall exalt himself
shall be abased." Plain it is that these passages carry a
severe rebuke, both to worldly honour in general, and to
those members and expressions of it in particular, which,
as near as the language of Scripture and customs of that
age will permit, do distinctly reach and allude to those of
our own time; for the declining of which we have suffered
so much scorn and abuse, both in our persons and estates;
God forgive the unreasonable authors of it!

XXXIII. The apostle Paul has a saying of great weight[113]
and fervency, in his epistle to the Romans, very agreeable
to this doctrine of Christ; it is this: "I beseech you
therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present
your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service; and be not conformed
to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of
your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, that
acceptable, and perfect will of God." (Rom. xii. 1, 2.)
He wrote to a people, in the midst of the ensnaring pomp
and glory of the world. Rome was the seat of Cæsar,
and the empire; the mistress of invention. Her fashions,
as those of France now, were as laws to the world, at least
at Rome: whence it is proverbial, Cum fueris Romæ,
Romano vivito more. "When thou art at Rome, thou
must do as Rome does." But the apostle is of another
mind; he warns the Christians of that city, that they
be not conformed; that is, that they do not follow the
vain fashions and customs of this world, but leave them.
The emphasis lies upon this, as well as upon conformed;
and it imports, that this world, which they were not to
conform to, was the corrupt and degenerate condition
of mankind in that age. Wherefore the apostle proceeds
to exhort those believers, and that by the mercies of
God, the most powerful and winning of all arguments,
that they would be transformed; that is, changed from
the way of life customary among the Romans; and prove
what is that acceptable will of God. As if he had said,
Examine what you do and practise; see if it be right,
and that it please God; call every thought, word, and
action to judgment; (John, iii. 21;) try whether they are
wrought in God or not; that so you may prove or know,
what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of
God.

XXXIV. The next scripture authority we appeal to,
in our vindication, is a passage of the apostle Peter, in[114]
his first epistle written to the believing strangers throughout
the countries of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,
and Bithynia; which were the churches of Christ Jesus
in those parts of the world, gathered by his power and
spirit: it is this; "Gird up the loins of your minds; be
sober and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be
brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; as
obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to
the former lusts in your ignorance." (1 Pet. i. 13, 14.)
That is, be not found in the vain fashions and customs of
the world, unto which you conformed in your former
ignorance; but as you have believed in a more plain and
excellent way, so be sober and fervent, and hope to the
end: do not give out; let them mock on; bear ye the
contradiction of sinners constantly, as obedient children,
that you may receive the kindness of God, at the revelation
of Jesus Christ. And therefore does the apostle call them
strangers, a figurative speech, people estranged from the
customs of the world, of new faith and manners; and so
unknown of the world: and if such strangers, then not
to be fashioned or conformed to their pleasing respects
and honours, whom they were estranged from: because
the strangeness lay in leaving that which was customary
and familiar to them before. The following words, verse
17, prove he used the word strangers in a spiritual sense;
"Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear;" that is,
pass the time of your being as strangers on earth in fear;
not after the fashions of the world. A word in the next
chapter, further explains his sense, where he tells the
believers, that they are a peculiar people; to wit, a distinct,
a singular and separate people from the rest of the world:
not any longer to fashion themselves according to their
customs. But I do not know how that could be, if they
were to live in communion with the world, in its respects
and honours; for that is not to be a peculiar or separate[115]
people from them, but to be like them, because conformable
to them.

XXXV. I shall conclude my scripture testimonies
against the foregoing respects, with that memorable and
close passage of the apostle James against respect of
persons in general after the world's fashion: "My brethren,
have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of
glory, with respect of persons: for if there come unto your
assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel: and
there come in also a poor man in vile raiment, and ye
have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and
say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place, (or well and
seemly, as the word is;) and say to the poor, Stand
thou there, or sit here under my footstool; are ye not
then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of
evil thoughts?" (James, ii. 1-4.) That is, they
knew they did amiss: "If ye fulfil the royal law,
according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself, ye do well; but if ye have respect to persons,
ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors."
(James, ii. 8, 9.) This is so full there seems
nothing left for me to add, or others to object. We are
not to respect persons, that is the first thing: and the
next thing is, if we do we commit sin, and break the law;
At our own peril be it. And yet perhaps some will say,
that by this we overthrow all distinction amongst men,
under their divers qualities, and introduce a reciprocal and
relational respect in the room of it: but if it be so, I
cannot help it, the apostle James must answer for it, who
has given us this doctrine for Christian and apostolical.
And yet one greater than he told his disciples, of whom
James was one, "Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles
exercise dominion over them, &amp;c. But it shall not be so
among you; but whosoever will be chief among you, let
him be your servant." (Mat. xx. 25-27.) That is, he[116]
that affects rule, and seeks to be uppermost, shall be
esteemed least among you. And to say true on the whole
matter, whether we regard those early times of the world,
that were antecedent to the coming of Christ or soon after,
there was yet a greater simplicity than in the times in
which we are fallen. For those early times of the world,
as bad as they were in other things, were great strangers
to the frequency of these follies: nay, they hardly used
some of them, at least very rarely. For if we read the
Scriptures, such a thing as my lord Adam, though lord of
the world, is not to be found: nor my lord Noah neither,
the second lord of the earth: nor yet my lord Abraham,
the father of the faithful; nor my lord Isaac; nor my lord
Jacob; but much less is my lord Paul, &amp;c. to be found in
the Bible: and less your holiness, or your grace. Nay,
among the Gentiles, the people wore their own names with
more simplicity, and used not the ceremony of speech that
is now practised among Christians, nor yet anything like
it. My lord Solon, my lord Phocion, my lord Plato, my
lord Aristotle, my lord Scipio, my lord Fabius, my lord
Cato, my lord Cicero, are not to be read in any of the
Greek or Latin stories, and yet they were some of the
sages and heroes of those great empires. No, their own
names were enough to distinguish them from other men,
and their virtue and employments in the public service
were their titles of honour. Nor has this vanity yet crept
far into the Latin writers, where it is familiar for authors
to cite the most learned and the most noble, without any
addition to their names, unless worthy or learned: and if
their works give it them, we make no conscience to deny
it them. For instance; the Fathers they only cite thus:
Polycarpus, Ignatius, Irenæus, Cyprian, Tertullian, Origen,
Arnobius, Lactantius, Chrysostom, Jerom, &amp;c. More
modern writers; Damascen, Rabanus, Paschasius, Theophylact,
Bernard, &amp;c. And of the last age, Luther, Melancthon,[117]
Calvin, Beza, Zuinglius, Marlorat, Vossius,
Grotius, Dalleus, Amyralldus, &amp;c. And of our own
country, Gildas, Beda, Alcuinus, Horn, Bracton, Grosteed,
Littleton, Cranmer, Ridley, Jewel, Whitaker, Seldon, &amp;c.
And yet I presume this will not be thought uncivil or
rude. Why then is our simplicity (and so honestly
grounded too, as conscience against pride in man, that so
evilly and perniciously loves and seeks worship and
greatness) so much despised and abused, and that by professed
Christians too, who take themselves to be the
followers of Him, that has forbidden these foolish customs,
as plainly as any other impiety condemned in his doctrine?
I earnestly beg the lovers, users, and expecters of these
ceremonies, to let this I have written have some consideration
and weight with them.

XXXVI. However, Christians are not so ill-bred as
the world think; for they show respect too: but the
difference between them lies in the nature of the respect
they perform, and the reasons of it. The world's respect
is an empty ceremony, no soul nor substance in it: the
Christian's is a solid thing, whether by obedience to
superiors, love to equals, or help and countenance to
inferiors. Next, their reasons and motives to honour and
respect, are as wide one from the other: for fine apparel,
empty titles, or large revenues are the world's motives, being
things her children worship: but the Christian's motives
are the sense of his duty in God's sight; first to parents
and magistrates; and then to inferior relations: and
lastly to all people, according to their virtue, wisdom, and
piety; which is far from respect to the mere persons of
men, or having their persons in admiration for reward:
much less on such mean and base motives as wealth and
sumptuous raiment.

XXXVII. We shall easily grant, our honour, as our
religion, is more hidden; and that neither are so discernible[118]
by worldly men, nor grateful to them. Our
plainness is odd, uncouth, and goes mightily against the
grain; but so does Christianity too, and that for the same
reasons. But had not the Heathen spirit prevailed too
long under a Christian profession, it would not be so hard
to discern the right from the wrong. O that Christians
would look upon themselves with the glass of righteousness;
that which tells true, and gives them an exact
knowledge of themselves! And then let them examine,
what in them, and about them, agrees with Christ's
doctrine and life; and they may soon resolve, whether
they are real Christians, or but Heathens christened with
the name of Christians.


SOME TESTIMONIES FROM ANCIENT AND MODERN WRITERS
IN FAVOUR OF OUR BEHAVIOUR.

XXXVIII. Marlorat, out of Luther and Calvin, upon
that remarkable passage I just now urged from the apostle
James, gives us the sense those primitive reformers had of
respect to persons in these words, viz. 'To respect
persons here, is to have regard to the habit and garb: the
apostle signifies, that such respecting of persons is so
contrary to true faith, that they are altogether inconsistent:
but if the pomp, and other worldly regards prevail,
and weaken what is of Christ, it is a sign of a decaying
faith. Yea, so great is the glory and splendour of Christ
in a pious soul, that all the glories of the world have no
charms, no beauty, in comparison of that, unto one so
righteously inclined. The apostle maketh such respecting
of persons, to be repugnant to the light within them,
insomuch as they who follow these practices, are condemned
from within themselves. So that sanctity ought
to be the reason or motive of all outward respect; and
that none is to be honoured, upon any account but[119]
holiness.' Thus much Marlorat. But if this be true
doctrine, we are much in the right in refusing conformity
to the vain respects of worldly men.

XXXIX. But I shall add to these, the admonition of a
learned ancient writer, who lived about 1200 years since,
of great esteem, namely Jerom, who writing to a noble
matron, Celantia, directing her how to live in the midst of
her prosperity and honours, amongst many other religious
instructions, speaks thus: 'Heed not thy nobility, nor let
that be a reason for thee to take place of any; esteem not
those of a meaner extraction to be thy inferiors; for our
religion admits of no respect of persons, nor doth it
induce us to repute men, from any external condition, but
from their inward frame and disposition of mind: it is
hereby that we pronounce men noble or base. With God,
not to serve sin is to be free; and to excel in virtue is to
be noble. God has chosen the mean and contemptible of
this world, whereby to humble the great ones. Besides,
it is a folly for any to boast his gentility, since all are
equally esteemed by God. The ransom of the poor and
rich cost Christ an equal expense of blood. Nor is it
material in what state a man is born; the new creature
hath no distinction. But if we will forget how we all
descended from one Father; we ought at least perpetually
to remember that we have but one Saviour.'

XL. But since I am engaged against these fond and
fruitless customs, the proper effects and delights of vain
and proud minds, let me yet add one memorable passage
more, as it is related by the famous Casaubon, in his
discourse of Use and Custom, where he briefly reports,
what passed between Sulpitius Severus and Paulinus,
bishop of Nola, (but such an one as gave all to redeem
captives; whilst others of that function, that they may
show who is their master, are making many both beggars
and captives, by countenancing the plunder and imprisonment[120]
of Christians, for pure conscience to God); he
brings it in thus: 'He is not counted a civil man now, of
late years amongst us, who thinks it much, or refuseth to
subscribe himself servant, though it be to his equal or
inferior.' Yet Sulpitius Severus was once sharply chid
by Paulinus for subscribing himself his servant, in a letter
of his, saying, 'Take heed hereafter, how thou being from
a servant called into liberty, dost subscribe thyself servant
unto one who is thy brother and fellow-servant; for it is
a sinful flattery, not a testimony of humility, to pay those
honours to a man, and a sinner, which are due to the one
Lord, and one Master, and one God.' By this we may
see the sense of some of the more apostolical bishops,
about the civilities and fashions so much reputed with
people that call themselves Christians and bishops, and
who would be thought their successors. It was then a
sin, it is now an accomplishment: it was then a flattery,
it is now respect: it was then fit to be severely reproved;
and now, alas! it is to deserve severe reproof not to use
it. O monstrous vanity! How much, how deeply, have
those who are called Christians revolted from the plainness
of the primitive days, and practice of holy men and women
in former ages! How are they become degenerated into
the loose, proud, and wanton customs of the world, which
knows not God; to whom use hath made these things,
condemned by scripture, reason, and example, almost
natural! And so insensible are they of both their cause
and bad effects, that they not only continue to practise
them, but plead for them, and unchristianly make a very
mock of those who cannot imitate them. But I shall
proceed to what remains yet further to be said in our
defence, for declining another custom, which helps to
make us so much the stumbling-block of this light, vain,
and inconsiderate age.



[121]




CHAPTER X.



1. Another piece of nonconformity to the world, which is our
simple and plain speech, thou for you.&mdash;2. Justified from the use
of words and numbers, singular and plural.&mdash;3. It was, and is
the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin speech, in schools and universities.&mdash;4.
It is the language of all nations.&mdash;5. The original of
the present customs defends our disuse of it.&mdash;6. If custom should
prevail, in a sense it would be on our side.&mdash;7. It cannot be
uncivil or improper, for God himself, the fathers, prophets, Christ,
and his apostles used it.&mdash;8. An instance given in the case of
Peter, in the palace of the high priest.&mdash;9. It is the practice of
men to God in their prayers: the pride of man to expect better
to himself.&mdash;10. Testimonies of several writers in vindication of
us.&mdash;11. The Author's convictions; and his exhortation to his
reader.


I. There is another piece of our nonconformity to the
world, that renders us very clownish to the breeding of it,
and that is, thou for you, and that without difference or
respect to persons: a thing that to some looks so rude it
cannot well go down without derision or wrath. But as
we have the same original reason for declining this, as
the foregoing customs, so I shall add, what to me looks
reasonable in our defence; though it is very probable
height of mind, in some of those that blame us, will very
hardly allow them to believe that the word reasonable
is reconcileable with so silly a practice as this is esteemed.

II. Words of themselves are but as so many marks set
and employed for necessary and intelligible mediums, or
means, whereby men may understandingly express their[122]
minds and conceptions to each other: from whence
comes conversation. Now, though the world be divided
into many nations, each of which, for the most part,
has a peculiar language, speech, or dialect, yet have
they ever concurred in the same numbers and persons,
as much of the ground of right speech. For instance;
I love, thou lovest, he loveth, are of singular number,
importing but one whether in the first, second, or third
person: also we love, ye love, they love, are of the plural
number, because in each is implied more than one.
Which undeniable grammatical rule, might be enough to
satisfy any, that have not forgotten their accidence, that
we are not beside reason in our practice. For if thou
lovest, be singular, and you love, be plural; and if thou
lovest, signifies but one; and you love, many; is it not as
proper to say, thou lovest, to ten men, as to say, you love,
to one man? Or, why not, I love, for we love; and we
love, instead of I love? Doubtless it is the same, though
most improper, and in speech ridiculous.

III. Our next reason is; if it be improper or uncivil
speech, as termed by this vain age, how comes it that the
Hebrew, Greek, and Roman authors, used in schools and
universities, have no other? Why should they not be a
rule in that, as well as other things? And why, I
pray then, are we so ridiculous for being thus far grammatical?
Is it reasonable that children should be whipped
at school for putting you for thou, as having made false
Latin; and yet that we must be, though not whipped,
reproached, and often abused, when we use the contrary
propriety of speech?

IV. But in the third place, it is neither improper nor
uncivil, but much otherwise; because it is used in all
languages, speeches, and dialects, and that through all
ages. This is very plain: as for example, it was God's
language when he first spake to Adam, viz. Hebrew: also[123]
it is the Assyrian, Chaldean, Grecian and Latin speech.
And now among the Turks, Tartars, Muscovites, Indians,
Persians, Italians, Spaniards, French, Dutch, Germans,
Polonians, Swedes, Danes, Irish, Scotch, Welsh, as well
as English there is a distinction preserved, and the word
thou is not lost in the word which goes for you. And
though some of the modern tongues have done as we do,
yet upon the same error. But by this it is plain, that
thou is no upstart, nor yet improper, but the only proper
word to be used in all languages to a single person;
because otherwise all sentences, speeches, and discourses
may be very ambiguous, uncertain, and equivocal. If a
jury pronounce a verdict or a judge a sentence, three
being at the bar, upon three occasions, very differently
culpable, and should say, You are here guilty and to die;
or innocent, and discharged: who knows who is guilty or
innocent? May be but one, perhaps two; or it may be,
all three: therefore our indictments run in the singular
number, as Hold up thy hand: thou art indicted by the
name of, &amp;c., for that thou, not having the fear of God, &amp;c.
And it holds the same in all conversation. Nor can this
be avoided but by many unnecessary circumlocutions.
And as the preventing of such length and obscurity was
doubtless the first reason for the distinction, so cannot
that be justly disused till the reason be first removed;
which can never be whilst two are in the world.

V. But this is not all; it was first ascribed in way of
flattery to proud popes and emperors, imitating the heathens'
vain homage to their gods; thereby ascribing a
plural honour to a single person: as if one pope had been
made up of many gods, and one emperor of many men;
for which reason, you only to be used to many, became
first spoken to one. It seems the word thou looked like
too lean and thin a respect; and therefore, some bigger
than they should be, would have a style suitable to their[124]
own ambition: a ground we cannot build our practice on;
for what began it only loves it still. But supposing you
to be proper to a prince, it will not follow it is to a
common person. For his edict runs, We will and require,
because, perhaps, in conjunction with his council: and
therefore you to a private person is an abuse of the word.
But as pride first gave it birth, so hath she only promoted
it. Monsieur, sir, and madam, were originally names
given to none but the king, his brother, and their wives,
both in France and England; yet now the ploughman in
France is called monsieur, and his wife madame: and men
of ordinary trades in England, sir, and their wives, dame;
which is the legal title of a lady, or else mistress, which
is the same with madame in French. So prevalent hath
pride and flattery been in all ages, the one to give and the
other to receive respects, as they term it.

VI. But some will tell us, custom should rule us; and
that is against us. But it is easily answered, and more
truly, that though in things reasonable or indifferent, custom
is obliging or harmless, yet in things unreasonable or
unlawful, she has no authority. For custom can no more
change numbers than genders, nor yoke one and you together,
than make a man into a woman, or one into a
thousand. But if custom be to conclude us, it is for us;
for as custom is nothing more than ancient usage, I appeal
to the practice of mankind, from the beginning of the
world, through all nations, against the novelty of this confusion,
viz. you to one person. Let custom, which is
ancient practice and fact, issue this question. Mistake
me not: I know words are nothing, but as men give them
a value or force by use; but then, if you will discharge
thou, and that you must succeed in its place, let us have a
distinguishing word instead of you to be used in speech
to many: but to use the same word for one and many,
when there are two, and that only to please a proud and[125]
haughty humour in man, is not reasonable in our sense:
which we hope is Christian, though not modish.

VII. But if thou to a single person be improper or
uncivil, God himself, all the holy fathers and prophets,
Christ Jesus, and his apostles, the primitive saints, all
languages throughout the world, and our own law proceedings
are guilty; which, with submission, were great presumption
to imagine. Besides, we all know it is familiar
with most of our authors to preface their discourses to the
reader in the same language of thee and thou: as, Reader,
thou art desired, &amp;c. Or, Reader, this is written to inform
thee of the occasion, &amp;c. And it cannot be denied, that
the most famous poems, dedicated to love or majesty, are
written in this style. Read of each in Chaucer, Spenser,
Waller, Cowley, Dryden, &amp;c. Why then should it be so
homely, ill-bred, and insufferable in us? This, I conceive,
can never be answered.

VIII. I doubt not at all that something altogether
as singular attended the speech of Christ and his disciples:
for I remember it was urged upon Peter in the high priest's
palace, as a proof of his belonging to Jesus, when he
denied his Lord: "Surely," said they, "thou art also one
of them: for thy speech bewrayeth thee." (Matt. xxvi.
73.) They had guessed by his looks but just before that
he had been with Jesus; but when they discoursed with
him, his language put them all out of doubt: surely then
he was one of them, and he had been with Jesus. Something
it was he had learned in his company that was odd
and observable; to be sure, not of the world's behaviour.
Without question, the garb, gait, and speech of his followers
differed, as well as his doctrine, from the world;
for it was a part of his doctrine it should be so. It is easy
to believe they were more plain, grave, and precise, which
is more credible from the way which poor, confident, fearful
Peter took to disguise the business; for he fell to[126]
cursing and swearing&mdash;a sad shift. But he thought that
the likeliest way to remove the suspicion, that was most
unlike Christ. And the policy took; for it silenced their
objections, and Peter was as orthodox as they. But
though they found him not out, the cock's crow did;
which made Peter remember his dear suffering Lord's
words: and he went forth, and wept bitterly; that he had
denied his Master, who was then delivered up to die for him.

IX. But our last reason is of most weight with me, and
because argumentum ad hominem, it is most heavy with
our despisers, which is this: it should not therefore be
urged upon us, because it is a most extravagant piece of
pride in a mortal man to require or expect from his fellow-creature
a more civil speech or grateful language, than he
is wont to give to the immortal God and his Creator in all
his worship to him. Art thou, O man, greater than he
that made thee? Canst thou approach the God of thy
breath and great Judge of thy life with thou and thee, and
when thou risest off thy knees, scorn a Christian for giving
to thee, poor mushroom of the earth, no better language
than thou hast given to God but just before? An arrogancy
not to be easily equalled! But again, it has either
too much or too little respect; if too much, do not reproach
and be angry, but gravely and humbly refuse it; if too
little, why dost thou show to God no more? O whither
is man gone! To what a pitch does he soar! He would
be used more civilly by us than he uses God; which is to
have us make more than a God of him: but he shall want
worshippers of us, as well as he wants the divinity in
himself that deserves to be worshipped. Certain we are,
that the Spirit of God seeks not these respects, much less
pleads for them, or would be wroth with any that conscientiously
refuse to give them. But that this vain generation
is guilty of using them, to gratify a vain mind, is too
palpable. What capping, what cringing, what scraping,[127]
what vain, unmeant words, most hyperbolical expressions,
compliments, gross flatteries, and plain lies, under the
name of civilities, are men and women guilty of in conversation!
Ah! my friends! whence fetch you these
examples? What part of all the writings of the holy men
of God warrants these things? But, to come nearer to
your own profession, is Christ your example herein, whose
name you pretend to bear; or those saints of old that
lived in desolate places, of whom the world was not
worthy: (Heb. xi. 38:) or do you think you follow the
practice of those Christians that, in obedience to their
Master's life and doctrine, forsook the respect of persons,
and relinquished the fashions, honour, and glory of this
transitory world; whose qualifications lay not in external
gestures, respects, and compliments, but in a meek and
quiet spirit, (1 Pet. iii. 4,) adorned with temperance,
virtue, modesty, gravity, patience, and brotherly kindness;
which were the tokens of true honour, and only badges of
respect and nobility in those Christian times? O no. But
is it not to expose ourselves both to your contempt and
fury, that we imitate them, and not you? And tell us,
pray, are not romances, plays, masks, gaming, fiddlers, &amp;c.
the entertainments that most delight you? Had you the
spirit of Christianity indeed, could you consume your most
precious little time in so many unnecessary visits, games,
and pastimes; in your vain compliments, courtships,
feigned stories, flatteries, and fruitless novelties, and what
not; invented and used to your diversion, to make you
easy in your forgetfulness of God: which never was the
Christian way of living, but entertainment of the heathens
that knew not God? Oh! were you truly touched with a
sense of your sins, and in any measure born again; did
you take up the cross of Jesus and live under it, these,
which so much please your wanton and sensual nature,[128]
would find no place with you. This is not seeking the
things that are above, (Col. iii. 1,) to have the heart thus
set on things that are below; nor working out your own
salvation with fear and trembling, to spend your days in
vanity. This is not crying with Elihu, "I know not to
give flattering titles to men; for in so doing my Maker
would soon take me away." This is not to deny self, and
lay up a more hidden and enduring substance, an eternal
inheritance in the heavens, that will not pass away. Well,
my friends, whatever you think, your plea of custom will
find no place at God's tribunal: the light of Christ in
your own hearts will overrule it; and this Spirit, against
which we testify, shall then appear to be what we say it
is. Say not I am serious about slight things; but beware
you of levity in serious things.

X. Before I close, I shall add a few testimonies from
men of general credit, in favour of our nonconformity to
the world in this particular.

Luther, the great reformer, whose sayings were oracles
with the age he lived in, and of no less reputation now,
with many that object against us, was so far from condemning
our plain speech, that in his Ludus, he sports
himself with you to a single person as an incongruous and
ridiculous speech, viz. Magister, vos estis iratus? Master,
are you angry? As absurd with him in Latin, as My
masters, art thou angry? is in English. Erasmus, a
learned man, and an exact critic in speech, than whom I
know not any we may so properly refer the grammar of
the matter to, not only derides it, but bestows a whole
discourse upon rendering it absurd: plainly manifesting
that it is impossible to preserve numbers if you, the only
word for more than one, be used to express one: as also,
that the original of this corruption was the corruption of
flattery. Lipsius affirms of the ancient Romans, "That[129]
the manner of greeting now in vogue was not in use
amongst them." To conclude: Howel, in his History of
France, gives us an ingenious account of its original;
where he not only assures us, "That anciently the peasants
thou'd their kings, but that pride and flattery first
put inferiors upon paying a plural respect to the single
person of every superior, and superiors upon receiving it."
And though we had not the practice of God and man so
undeniably to justify our plain and homely speech, yet,
since we are persuaded that its original was from pride
and flattery, we cannot in conscience use it. And however
we may be censured as singular by those loose and airy
minds, that through the continual love of earthly pleasures,
consider not the true rise and tendency of words
and things; yet to us whom God has convinced by his
light and Spirit in our hearts of the folly and evil of such
courses, and brought into a spiritual discerning of the
nature and ground of the world's fashions, they appear to
be fruits of pride and flattery; and we dare not continue
in such vain compliances to earthly minds, lest we offend
God, and burden our consciences. But having been sincerely
affected with the reproofs of instruction, and our
hearts being brought into a watchful subjection to the
righteous law of JESUS, so as to bring our deeds to the
light, (John, iii. 19-21,) to see in whom they are wrought,
if in God or not; we cannot, we dare not conform ourselves
to the fashions of the world that pass away; knowing
assuredly, that "for every idle word that men shall
speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment."
(Matt. xii. 36.)

XI. Wherefore, reader, whether thou art a night-walking
Nicodemus, or a scoffing scribe; one that would visit
the blessed Messiah, but in the dark customs of the world,
that thou mightest pass as undiscerned, for fear of bearing
his reproachful cross; or else a favourer of Haman's pride,[130]
and countest these testimonies but a foolish singularity; I
must say, Divine love enjoins me to be a messenger of
truth to thee, and a faithful witness against the evil of this
degenerate world, as in other, so in these things; in which
the spirit of vanity and lust hath got so great a head, and
lived so long uncontrolled, that it hath impudence enough
to term its darkness light, and to call its evil offspring by
the names due to a better nature, the more easily to
deceive people into the practice of them. And truly, so
very blind and insensible are most of what spirit they are,
and ignorant of the meek and self-denying life of holy
Jesus, whose name they profess; that to call each other
Rabbi, that is, master; to bow to men, which I call
worship; and to greet with flattering titles, and to do
their fellow-creatures homage; to scorn that language to
themselves that they give to God, and to spend their time
and estate to gratify their wanton minds; the customs of
the Gentiles, that knew not God, pass with them for
civility, good-breeding, decency, recreation, accomplishments,
&amp;c. O that man would consider, since there are
but two spirits, one good, the other evil, which of them
it is that inclines the world to these things; and whether
it be Nicodemus or Mordecai in thee, that doth befriend
these despised Christians, which makes thee ashamed to
disown that openly in conversation with the world, which
the true light hath made vanity and sin to thee in secret!
Or if thou art a despiser, tell me, I pray thee, what dost
thou think thy mockery, anger, or contempt dost most
resemble, proud Haman, or good Mordecai? My friend,
know that no man hath more delighted in, or been prodigal
of those vanities called civilities than myself; and could
I have covered my conscience under the fashions of the
world, truly I had found a shelter from showers of reproach
that have fallen very often and thick upon me; but had I,
with Joseph, conformed to Egypt's customs, I had sinned[131]
against my God and lost my peace. But I would not
have thee think it is a mere thou or title simply or nakedly
in themselves we boggle at, or that we would beget or
set up any form inconsistent with sincerity or true civility:
there is but too much of that; but the esteem and value
the vain minds of men do put upon them, that ought to be
crossed and stripped of their delights, constrains us to
testify so steadily against them. And this know, from the
sense God's Holy Spirit hath begotten in us, that that
which requires these customs, and begets fear to leave
them, and pleads for them, and is displeased, if not used
and paid, is the spirit of pride and flattery in the ground;
though frequency, use, or generosity may have abated its
strength in some: and this being discovered by the light
that now shines from heaven in the hearts of the despised
Christians I have communion with, necessitates them to
this testimony; and myself, as one of them and for them,
in a reproof of the unfaithful, who would walk undiscerned,
though convinced to the contrary; and for an allay to the
proud despisers, who scorn us as a people guilty of affectation
and singularity. For the eternal God, who is great
amongst us, and on his way in the earth to make his
power known, will root up every plant that his right hand
hath not planted. Wherefore let me beseech thee, reader,
to consider the foregoing reasons, which were mostly
given me from the Lord, in that time, when my condescension
to these fashions would have been purchased at
almost any rate; but the certain sense I had of their contrariety
to the meek and self-denying life of holy JESUS,
required of me my disuse of them, and faithful testimony
against them. I speak the truth in Christ; I lie not: I
would not have brought myself under censure and disdain
for them, could I, with peace of conscience, have kept my
belief under a worldly behaviour. It was extremely irksome
to me to decline, and expose myself; but having an[132]
assured and repeated sense of the original of these vain
customs, that they rise from pride, self-love, and flattery, I
dared not gratify that mind in myself or others. And for
this reason it is, that I am earnest with my readers to be
cautious how they reprove us on this occasion; and do
once more entreat them that they would seriously weigh in
themselves, whether it be the spirit of the world or of the
Father, that is so angry with our honest, plain, and harmless
thou and thee: that so every plant that God our
heavenly Father hath not planted in the sons and daughters
of men may be rooted up.



[133]




CHAPTER XI.



1. Pride leads people to an excessive value of their persons.&mdash;2. It
is plain, from the racket that is made about blood and families:
also in the case of shape and beauty.&mdash;3. Blood no nobility, but
virtue.&mdash;4. Virtue no upstart: antiquity no nobility without it,
else age and blood would bar virtue in the present age.&mdash;5. God
teaches the true sense of nobility, who made of one blood all
nations; there is the original of all blood.&mdash;6. These men of
blood, out of their feathers, look like other men.&mdash;7. This is not
said to reject, but humble the gentleman: the advantages of that
condition above others. An exhortation to recover their lost
economy in families, out of interest and credit.&mdash;8. But the author
has a higher motive; the gospel, and the excellencies of it, which
they profess.&mdash;9. The pride of persons respecting shape and
beauty: the washes, patches, paintings, dresses, &amp;c. This excess
would keep the poor: the mischiefs that attend it.&mdash;10. But
pride in the old and homely yet more hateful: that it is usual.
The madness of it. Counsel to the beautiful to get their souls
like their bodies; and to the homely to supply want of that in
the adornment of their lasting part, their souls, with holiness.
Nothing homely with God but sin. The blessedness of those that
wear Christ's yoke and cross, and are crucified to the world.


I. But pride stops not here; she excites people to an
excessive value and care of their persons: they must have
great and punctual attendance, stately furniture, rich and
exact apparel. All which help to make up that pride of
life that John tells us is not of the Father, but of the
world. (1 John, ii. 16.) A sin God charged upon the
haughty daughters of Zion, (Isaiah, iii.) and on the proud
prince and people of Tyrus. (Ezek. xxvii. xxviii.) Read
these chapters, and measure this age by their sins, and[134]
what is coming on these nations by their judgments. But
at the present I shall only touch upon the first, viz. the
excessive value people have of their persons; leaving the
rest to be considered under the last head of this discourse,
which is luxury, where they may be not improperly
placed.

II. That people are generally proud of their persons is
too visible and troublesome; especially if they have any
pretence either to blood or beauty; the one has raised
many quarrels among men, and the other among women,
and men too often for their sakes and at their excitements.
But to the first: What a pother has this noble blood made
in the world:&mdash;antiquity of name or family, whose father,
or mother, great grandfather, or great grandmother was
best descended or allied:&mdash;what stock or what clan they
came of:&mdash;what coat of arms they gave:&mdash;which had, of
right, the precedence! But methinks nothing of man's
folly has less show of reason to palliate it.

III. For, first, what matter is it of whom any one is
descended, that is not of ill fame: since it is his own
virtue that must raise, or vice depress him? An ancestor's
character is no excuse to a man's ill actions, but an aggravation
of his degeneracy: and since virtue comes not by
generation, I neither am the better nor the worse for my
forefather; to be sure, not in God's account, nor should it
be in man's. Nobody would endure injuries the easier, or
reject favours the more, for coming by the hand of a man
well or ill descended. I confess it were greater honour to
have had no blots, and with an hereditary estate, to have
had a lineal descent or worth; but that was never found:
no; not in the most blessed of families upon earth, I mean
Abraham's. To be descended of wealth and titles, fills no
man's head with brains or heart with truth: those qualities
come from a higher cause. It is vanity then and most
condemnable pride for a man of bulk and character to[135]
despise another of less size in the world and of meaner
alliance for want of them: because the latter may have
the merit, where the former has only the effects of it in an
ancestor: and though the one be great by means of a
forefather, the other is so too, but it is by his own: then,
pray, which is the braver man of the two?

IV. O, says the person proud of blood, It was never a
good world since we have had so many upstart gentlemen!
But what should others have said of that man's ancestor,
when he started first up into the knowledge of the world?
For he, and all men and families, aye, and all states and
kingdoms too, have had their upstarts, that is, their beginnings.
This is being like the true church, because old,
not because good: for families to be noble by being old,
and not by being virtuous. No such matter: it must be
age in virtue, or else virtue before age; for otherwise a
man should be noble by the means of his predecessor, and
yet the predecessor less noble than he, because he was the
acquirer: which is a paradox that will puzzle all their
heraldry to explain. Strange! that they should be more
noble than their ancestor that got their nobility for them!
But if this be absurd, as it is, then the upstart is the noble
man: the man that got it by his virtue; and those are
only entitled to his honour that are imitators of his virtue:
the rest may bear his name from his blood, but that is all.
If virtue then give nobility, which heathens themselves
agree, then families are no longer truly noble than they
are virtuous. And if virtue go not by blood, but by the
qualifications of the descendants, it follows blood is excluded:
else blood would bar virtue; and no man that
wanted the one, should be allowed the benefit of the
other: which were to stint and bound nobility for want of
antiquity, and make virtue useless.

No, let blood and name go together; but pray let
nobility and virtue keep company, for they are nearest of[136]
kin. It is thus profited by God himself, that best knows
how to apportion things with an equal and just hand.
He neither likes nor dislikes by descent; nor does He
regard what people were, but are. He remembers not the
righteousness of any man that leaves his righteousness;
(Ezek. xviii.;) much less any unrighteous man for the
righteousness of his ancestor.

V. But if these men of blood please to think themselves
concerned to believe and reverence God in his holy Scriptures,
they may learn that "in the beginning He made of
one blood all nations of men to dwell upon all the earth;"
(Acts, xvii. 26;) and that we all descended from one
father and mother. A more certain original than the best
of us can assign. From thence go down to Noah, who
was the second planter of the human race, and we are
upon some certainty for our forefathers. What violence
has reaped or virtue merited since, and how far we that
are alive are concerned in either, will be hard for us to
determine but a very few ages off us.

VI. But, methinks it should suffice to say, our own eyes
see that men of blood, out of their gear and trappings, without
their feathers and finery, have no more marks of honour
by nature stamped upon them, than their inferior neighbours.
Nay, themselves being judges, they will frankly tell us,
they feel all those passions in their blood, that make them
like other men, if not further from the virtue that truly
dignifies. The lamentable ignorance and debauchery that
now rages among too many of our greater sort of folks, is
too clear and casting an evidence in the point: and pray
tell me of what blood are they come?

VII. Howbeit, when I have said all this, I intend not,
by debasing one false quality, to make insolent another
that is not true. I would not be thought to set the churl
on the present gentleman's shoulder; by no means: his
rudeness will not mend the matter. But what I have[137]
written is to give aim to all where true nobility dwells,
that every one may arrive at it by the ways of virtue and
goodness. But for all this, I must allow a great advantage
to the gentleman, and therefore prefer his station: just as
the apostle Paul, who after he had humbled the Jews, that
insulted the Christians with their laws and rites, gave
them the advantage over all other nations in statutes and
judgments. I must grant that the condition of our great
men is much to be preferred to the ranks of our inferior
people. For, first, they have more power to do good;
and if their hearts be equal to their ability, they are blessings
to the people of any country. Secondly, the eyes of
the people are usually directed to them; and if they will
be kind, just, and hopeful, they shall have their affections
and services. Thirdly, they are not under equal straits
with the inferior sort; and consequently they have more
help, leisure, and occasion to polish their passions and
tempers with books and conversation. Fourthly, they
have more time to observe the actions of other nations: to
travel and view the laws, customs, and interests of other
countries, and bring home whatsoever is worthy or imitable.
And so an easier way is open for great men to get honour;
and such as love true reputation will embrace the best
means to it. But because it too often happens that great
men do but little mind to give God the glory of their
prosperity, and to live answerable to his mercies; but on
the contrary, live without God in the world, fulfilling the
lusts thereof, his hand is often seen, either in impoverishing
or extinguishing them, and raising up men of more
virtue and humility to their estates and dignity. However,
I must allow that among people of this rank there have
been some of them of more than ordinary virtue, whose
examples have given light to their families. And it has
been something natural for some of their descendants to
endeavour to keep up the credit of their houses in proportion[138]
to the merit of their founder. And to say true, if
there be any advantage in such descent, it is not from
blood but education: for blood has no intelligence in it,
and is often spurious and uncertain; but education has a
mighty influence and strong bias upon the affections and
actions of men. In this the ancient nobles and gentry
of this kingdom did excel: and it were much to be wished
that our great people would set about to recover the
ancient economy of their houses, the strict and virtuous
discipline of their ancestors, when men were honoured for
their achievements, and when nothing more exposed a man
to shame, than being born to a nobility that he had not a
virtue to support.

VIII. O, but I have a higher motive! The glorious
gospel of Jesus Christ, which having taught this northern
isle, and all ranks professing to believe in it, let me prevail
upon you to seek the honour that it has brought from
heaven, to all the true disciples of it, who are indeed the
followers of God's Lamb, that takes away the sin of the
world. (John, i. 29.) Receive with meekness his gracious
word into your hearts, that subdues the world's lusts, and
leads in the holy way to blessedness. Here are charms
no carnal eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor heart perceived,
but they are revealed to such humble converts by
his spirit. Remember you are but creatures, and that you
must die, and after all be judged.

IX. But personal pride ends not in nobility of blood;
it leads folks to a fond value of their persons, be they
noble or ignoble; especially if they have any pretence to
shape or beauty. It is admirable to see, how much it
is possible for some to be taken with themselves, as if
nothing else deserved their regard, or the good opinion of
others. It would abate their folly, if they could find in
their hearts to spare but half the time to think of God
and their latter end, which they most prodigally spend in[139]
washing, perfuming, painting, patching, attiring, and
dressing. In these things they are precise, and very
artificial; and for cost they spare not. But that which
aggravates the evil is, the pride of one might comfortably
supply the need of ten. Gross impiety that it is, that a
nation's pride should not be spared to a nation's poor!
But what is this for at last? Only to be admired,
to have reverence, draw love, and command the eyes
and affections of beholders. And so fantastic are they
in it, as hardly to be pleased too. Nothing is good,
or fine, or fashionable enough for them: the sun itself,
the blessing of heaven, and comfort of the earth, must not
shine upon them, lest it tan them; nor the wind blow, for
fear it should disorder them. O impious nicety! Yet
while they value themselves above all else, they make
themselves the vassals of their own pride; worshipping
their shape, feature, or complexion, whichsoever is their
excellency. The end of all which, is but too often to
excite unlawful love, which I call lust, and draw one
another into as miserable as evil circumstances: in single
persons it is of ill consequence; for if it does not awaken
unchaste desires, it lays no foundation for solid and lasting
union: the want of which helps to make so many unhappy
marriages in the world: but in married people the
sin is aggravated; for they have none of right to please,
but one another; and to affect the gaiety and vanity of
youth, is an ill sign of loving and living well at home: it
looks rather like dressing for a market. It has sad effects
in families: discontents, partings, duels, poisonings, and
other infamous murders. No age can better tell us the sad
effects of this sort of pride than this we live in; as, how
excessively wanton, so how fatal it has been to the sobriety,
virtue, peace, and health of families in this kingdom.

X. But I must needs say, that of all creatures, this sort
of pride does least become the old and homely, if I may[140]
call the ill-favoured and deformed so; for the old are
proud only of what they had, which shows, to their reproach,
their pride has outlived their beauty, and, when
they should be repenting, they are making work for repentance.
But the homely are yet worse, they are proud
of what they never had, nor ever can have: nay, their
persons seem as if they were given for a perpetual humiliation
to their minds; and to be proud of them is loving
pride for pride's sake, and to be proud, without a temptation
to be proud. And yet in my whole life I have
observed nothing more doting on itself: a strange infatuation
and enchantment of pride! What! Not to see
right with their eyes, because of the partiality of their
minds? This self-love is blind indeed. But to add
expense to the vanity, and to be costly upon that which
cannot be mended, one would think they should be downright
mad; especially if they consider, that they look the
homelier for the things that are thought handsome, and
do but thereby draw their deformity more into notice, by
that which does so little become them.

But in such persons' follies we have a specimen of
man; what a creature he is in his lapse from his primitive
image. All this, as Jesus said of sin of old, comes from
within; (Mat. xv. 11-20;) that is the disregard that
men and women have to the word of their Creator in their
hearts; (Deut. xxx. 14; Rom. x. 8;) which shows pride
and teaches humility, and self-abasement, and directs the
mind to the true object of honour and worship; and that
with an awe and reverence suitable to his sovereignty and
majesty. Poor mortals! But living dirt! Made of what
they tread on: who, with all their pride, cannot secure
themselves from the spoil of sickness, much less from the
stroke of death! O! did people consider the inconstancy
of all visible things, the cross and adverse occurrences of
man's life, the certainty of his departure, and eternal[141]
judgment, it is to be hoped they would bring their deeds
to Christ's light in their hearts, (John, iii. 20, 21,) and
they would see if they were wrought in God, or not, as the
beloved disciple tells us from his dear Master's mouth.
Art thou shapely, comely, beautiful&mdash;the exact draught of
a human creature? Admire that Power that made thee
so. Live an harmonious life to the curious make and frame
of thy creation; and let the beauty of thy body teach thee
to beautify thy mind with holiness, the ornament of the
beloved of God. Art thou homely or deformed; magnify
that goodness that did not make thee a beast; and with
the grace that is given unto thee, for it has appeared unto
all, learn to adorn thy soul with enduring beauty. Remember
the King of heaven's daughter, the church, of
which true Christians are members, is all glorious within.
And if thy soul excel, thy body will only set off the lustre
of thy mind. Nothing is homely in God's sight but sin;
and that man and woman that commune with their own
hearts, and sin not; who, in the light of holy Jesus, watch
over the movings and inclinations of their own souls, and
that suppress every evil in its conception, they love the
yoke and cross of Christ, and are daily by it crucified to
the world, but live to God in that life which outlives the
fading satisfactions of it.



[142]




CHAPTER XII.



1. The character of a proud man: a glutton upon himself: is
proud of his pedigree.&mdash;2. He is insolent and quarrelsome, but
cowardly, yet cruel.&mdash;3. An ill child, subject, and servant.&mdash;4.
Inhospitable.&mdash;5. No friend to any.&mdash;6. Dangerous and mischievous
in power.&mdash;7. Of all things, pride bad in ministers.&mdash;8.
They claim prerogative above others.&mdash;9. And call themselves
the clergy: their lordliness and avarice.&mdash;10. Death swallows
all.&mdash;11. The way to escape these evils.


I. To conclude this great head of pride, let us briefly see,
upon the whole matter, what is the character of a proud
man in himself, and in divers relations and capacities. A
proud man then is a kind of glutton upon himself; for he
is never satisfied with loving and admiring himself;
whilst nothing else, with him, is worthy either of love or
care: if good enough to be the servant of his will, it is as
much as he can find in his heart to allow: as if he had
been only made for himself, or rather that he had made
himself. For as he despises man, because he cannot
abide an equal, so he does not love God, because he
would not have a superior: he cannot bear to owe his
being to another, lest he should thereby acknowledge one
above himself. He is one that is mighty big with the
honour of his ancestors, but not of the virtue that brought
them to it; much less will he trouble himself to imitate
them. He can tell you of his pedigree, his antiquity,
what estate, what matches; but forgets that they are
gone, and that he must die too.

[143]

II. But how troublesome a companion is a proud man!
Ever positive and controlling; and if you yield not, insolent
and quarrelsome: yet at the upshot of the matter,
cowardly: but if strongest, cruel. He feels no more of
other men's miseries than if he were not a man, or it were
a sin to be sensible. For not feeling himself interested,
he looks no further; he will not disquiet his thoughts
with other men's infelicities; it shall content him to
believe they are just: and he had rather churlishly upbraid
them as the cause, than be ready to commiserate or relieve
them. So that compassion and charity are with him as
useless as humility and meekness are hateful.

III. A proud man makes an ill child, servant, and
subject; he contemns his parents, master, and prince; he
will not be subject. He thinks himself too wise, or too
old, to be directed; as if it were a slavish thing to obey;
and that none were free that may not do what they
please; which turns duty out of doors and degrades
authority. On the other hand, if he be a husband, or
father, or master, there is scarcely any enduring: he is so
insufferably curious and testy that it is an affliction to
live with him; for hardly can any hand carry it even
enough to please him. Some peccadillo about his clothes,
his diet, his lodging, or attendance quite disorders him:
but especially if he fancies any want of the state and
respect he looks for. Thus pride destroys the nature of
relations: on the one side, learns to contemn duty; and
on the other side, it turns love into fear, and makes the
wife a servant, and the children and servants slaves.

IV. But the proud man makes an ill neighbour too;
for he is an enemy to hospitality: he despises to receive
kindness, because he would not show any, nor be thought
to need it. Besides, it looks too equal and familiar for
his haughty humour. Emulation and detraction are his
element; for he is jealous of attributing any praise to[144]
others, where just; lest that should cloud and lessen him,
to whom it never could be due: he is the man that fears,
what he should wish, to wit, that others should do well.
But that is not all; he maliciously miscalls their acts of
virtue, which his corruptions will not let him imitate, that
they may get no credit by them. If he wants any occasion
of doing mischief, he can make one: either they use
him ill, or have some design upon him; the other day
they paid him not the cap and knee; the distance and
respect he thinks his quality, parts, or merits do require.
A small thing serves a proud man to pick a quarrel; of
all creatures the most jealous, sullen, spiteful and revengeful:
he can no more forgive an injury, than forbear
to do one.

V. Nor is this all: a proud man can never be a friend
to anybody. For besides that his ambition may always
be bribed by honour and preferment to betray that relation,
he is unconversable; he must not be catechised and
counselled, much less reproved or contradicted: no, he is
too covetous of himself to spare another man a share, and
much too high, stiff, and touchy: he will not away with
those freedoms that a real friendship requires. To say
true, he contemns the character; it is much too familiar
and humble for him: his mighty soul would know nothing
besides himself and vassals to stock the world. He values
other men, as we do cattle, for their service only; and, if
he could, would use them so; but as it happens, the
number and force are unequal.

VI. But a proud man in power is very mischievous;
for his pride is the more dangerous by his greatness, since
from ambition in private men, it becomes tyranny in him:
it would reign alone; nay live so, rather than have competitors:
Aut Cæsar, aut nullus. Reason must not check
it, nor rules of law limit it; and either it can do no wrong,
or it is sedition to complain of the wrong that it does. The[145]
men of this temper would have nothing thought amiss
they do; at least, they count it dangerous to allow it to be
so, though so it be; for that would imply they had erred,
which it is always matter of state to deny: no, they will
rather choose to perish obstinately, than by acknowledging,
yield away the reputation of better judging to
inferiors, though it were their prudence to do so. And
indeed, it is all the satisfaction that proud great men
make to the world for the miseries they often bring upon
it, that, first or last, upon a division, they leave their real
interest to follow some one excess of humour, and are
almost ever destroyed by it. This is the end pride gives
proud men, and the ruin it brings upon them, after it has
punished others by them.

VII. But above all things, pride is intolerable in men
pretending to religion; and of them in ministers; for they
are names of the greatest contradiction. I speak without
respect or anger, to persons or parties; for I only touch
upon the bad of all. What shall pride do with religion,
that rebukes it? Or ambition with ministers, whose very
office is humility? And yet there are but too many of
them, that, besides an equal guilt with others in the fleshly
pride of the world, are even proud of that name and office,
which ought always to remind them of self-denial. Yea,
they use it as the beggars do the name of God and Christ,
only to get by it: placing to their own account the advantages
of that reverend profession, and thereby making
their function but a political handle to raise themselves
to the great preferments of the world. But O then! how
can such be his ministers, that said, "My kingdom is not
of this world"? (John, xviii. 36.) Who, of mankind, more
self-conceited than these men? If contradicted, as arrogant
and angry, as if it were their calling to be so. Counsel
one of them, he scorns you: reprove him, and he is
almost ready to excommunicate you: 'I am a minister and[146]
an elder:' flying thither to secure himself from the reach
of just censure, which indeed exposes him but the more
to it: and therefore his fault cannot be the less, by how
much it is worse in a minister to do ill, and spurn at
reproof, than an ordinary man.

VIII. O, but he pleads an exemption by his office:
what! Shall he breed up chickens to pick out his own
eyes! Be rebuked or instructed by a layman or parishioner!
A man of less age, learning, or ability! No such
matter: he would have us believe that his ministerial
prerogative has placed him out of the reach of popular
impeachment. He is not subject to vulgar judgments.
Even questions about religion are schism: believe as he
says: it is not for you to pry so curiously into the mysteries
of religion: never good day since laymen meddle so much
with the minister's office. Not considering, poor man,
that the contrary is most true: not many good days
since ministers meddled so much in laymen's business.
Though perhaps there is little reason for this distinction,
besides spiritual gifts, and the improvement of them
by a diligent use of them for the good of others.

Such good sayings as these, Be ready to teach: answer
with meekness: let every man speak as of the gift of
God that is in him: if anything be revealed to him that
sits by, let the first hold his peace: be not lords over
God's heritage, but meek and lowly; washing the feet of
the people, (1 Cor. xiv. 30,) as Jesus did those of his poor
disciples;&mdash;are unreasonable and antiquated instructions
with some clergy, and it is little less than heresy to remind
them of these things: a mark of great disaffection to the
church in their opinion. For by this time their pride has
made them the church, and the people but the porch at
best; a cipher that signifies nothing, unless they clap
their figure before it: forgetting, that if they were as good
as they should be, they could be but ministers, stewards,[147]
and under-shepherds; that is, servants to the church,
family, flock, and heritage of God: and not that they are
that church, family, flock, and heritage, which they are
only servants unto. Remember the words of Christ, "Let
him that would be greatest be your servant." (Mat. xx. 26.)

IX. There is but one place to be found in the Holy
Scripture, where the word Clerus, can properly be applied
to the church, and they have got it to themselves; from
whence they call themselves the clergy, that is, the inheritance
or heritage of God. Whereas Peter exhorts the
ministers of the gospel, "Not to be lords over God's heritage,
nor to feed them for filthy lucre." (1 Peter, v. 2, 3.)
Peter belike, foresaw pride and avarice to be the ministers'
temptations; and indeed they have often proved their fall:
and to say true, they could hardly fall by worse. Nor is
there any excuse to be made for them in these two respects,
which is not worse than their sin. For if they have not
been lords over God's heritage, it is because they have
made themselves that heritage, and disinherited the people:
so that now they may be the people's lords, with a salvo
to good old Peter's exhortation.

And for the other sin of avarice, they can only avoid it,
and speak truth thus; that never feeding the flock, they
cannot be said to feed it for lucre: that is, they get the
people's money for nothing. An example of which is
given us, by the complaint of God himself, from the
practice of the proud, covetous, false prophets of old,
that the people gave their money for that which was not
bread, and their labour for that which did not profit
them: (Isaiah, lv. 2:) And why? Because then the
priest had no vision; and too many now despise it.

X. But alas! when all is done, what folly, as well as
irreligion, is there in pride! It cannot add one cubit to
any man's stature: what crosses can it hinder? What
disappointments help, or harm frustrate? It delivers not
from the common stroke; sickness disfigures, pain misshapes,[148]
and death ends the proud man's fabric. Six feet
of cold earth bounds his big thoughts; and his person,
that was too good for any place, must at last lodge within
the streight limits of so little and so dark a cave: and he
who thought nothing well enough for him, is quickly the
entertainment of the lowest of all animals, even worms
themselves. Thus pride and pomp come to the common
end; but with this difference, less pity from the living,
and more pain to the dying. The proud man's antiquity
cannot secure him from death, nor his heraldry from
judgment. Titles of honour vanish at this extremity; and
no power or wealth, no distance or respect, can rescue
or insure them. As the tree falls, it lies; and as death
leaves men, judgment finds them.

XI. O! what can prevent this ill conclusion? And
what can remedy this woeful declension from ancient
meekness, humility, and piety, and that godly life and power
which were so conspicuous in the authority of the preachings
and examples of the living, of the first and purest ages
of Christianity? Truly, nothing but an inward and sincere
examination, by the testimony of the holy light and spirit
of JESUS, of the condition of their souls and minds
towards Christ, and a better inquiry into the matter and
examples of holy record. It was his complaint of old,
"that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness
rather than light, because their deeds were evil." (John,
iii. 19.) If thou wouldst be a child of God, and a believer
in Christ, thou must be a child of Light. O man, thou
must bring thy deeds to it and examine them by that holy
lamp in thy soul, which is the candle of the Lord, that
shows thee thy pride and arrogancy, and reproves thy
delight in the vain fashions of this world. Religion is a
denial of self; yea, of self-religion too. It is a firm tie or
bond upon the soul to holiness, whose end is happiness;
for by it men come to see the Lord. The pure in heart,
says JESUS, see God: (Matt. v. 8:) he that once comes[149]
to bear Christ's yoke, is not carried away by the devil's
allurements; he finds excelling joys in his watchfulness
and obedience. If men loved the cross of Christ, his
precepts and doctrine, they would cross their own wills,
which lead them to break Christ's holy will, and lose
their own souls, in doing the devil's. Had Adam minded
that holy light in Paradise more than the serpent's bait;
and stayed his mind upon his Creator, the rewarder of
fidelity, he had seen the snare of the enemy, and resisted
him. O do not delight in that which is forbidden! Look
not upon it, if thou wouldst not be captivated by it.
Bring not the guilt of sins of knowledge upon thy own
soul. Did Christ submit his will to his Father's, and for
the joy that was set before him, endure the cross and
despise the shame (Heb. xii. 2) of a new and untrodden
way to glory? Thou also must submit thy will to Christ's
holy law and light in thy heart, and for the reward He sets
before thee, to wit, eternal life, endure his cross, and
despise the shame of it. All desire to rejoice with Him,
but few will suffer with Him, or for Him. Many are the
companions of his table; not many of his abstinence.
The loaves they follow, but the cup of his agony they
leave: it is too bitter, they like not to drink thereof.
And divers will magnify his miracles, that are offended at
the ignominy of his cross. But O man, as He, for thy
salvation, so thou, for the love of Him, must humble
thyself, (Phil. ii. 7,) and be contented to be of no reputation,
that thou mayest follow Him, not in a carnal, formal
way, of vain man's tradition and prescription, but as the
Holy Ghost, by the apostle, doth express it, in a new and
living way, (Heb. x. 19, 20,) which Jesus had consecrated,
that brings all that walk in it to the eternal rest of God:
whereunto He himself is entered, who is the holy and only
blessed Redeemer.

discourse on that subject referred unto.&mdash;21. Peter Charron's
testimony against it.&mdash;22. Abraham Cowley's witty and sharp
satire upon it.


I. I am come to the second part of this discourse, which
is avarice, or covetousness, an epidemic and a raging distemper
in the world, attended with all the mischiefs that
can make men miserable in themselves, and in society;
so near akin to the foregoing evil, pride, that they are
seldom apart: Liberality being almost as hateful to the
proud, as to the covetous, I shall define it thus: Covetousness
is the love of money or riches; (Ephes. v. 3, 5;)
which, as the apostle hath it, "is the root of all evil."
(1 Tim. vi. 9, 10.) It branches itself into these three
parts: first, desiring of unlawful things; secondly, unlawfully
desiring of lawful things; and lastly, hoarding up, or
unprofitably withholding the benefit of them from the relief
of private persons, or the public. I shall first deliver the
sense of Scripture, and what examples are therein afforded[151]
against this impiety: and next, my own reasons, with
some authorities from authors of credit. By which it will
appear, that the working of the love of riches out of the
hearts of people, is as much the business of the cross of
Christ, as the rooting out of any one sin that man is fallen
into.

II. And first, of desiring, or coveting of unlawful
things: it is expressly forbidden by God himself, in the
law He delivered to Moses upon Mount Sinai, for a rule to
his people the Jews to walk by: "Thou shalt not covet,"
said God, "thy neighbour's house: thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant,
nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy
neighbour's." (Exodus, xx.) This God confirmed by
thundering and lightnings, and other sensible solemnities,
to strike the people with more awe in receiving and
keeping of it, and to make the breach of these moral
precepts more terrible to them. Micah complains in his
time, "They covet fields, and take them by violence;"
(Mic. ii. 2;) but their end was misery. Therefore was it
said of old, "Woe to them that covet an evil covetousness:"
this is to our point. We have many remarkable
instances of this in Scripture; two of which I will briefly
report.

III. David, though otherwise a good man, by unwatchfulness
is taken; the beauty of Uriah's wife was too hard
for him, being disarmed, and off from his spiritual watch.
There was no dissuasive would do; Uriah must be put
upon a desperate service, where it was great odds if he
survived it. This was to hasten the unlawful satisfaction
of his desires, by a way that looked not like direct
murder. The contrivance took; Uriah is killed, and his
wife is quickly David's. This interpreted David's covetousness.
But went it off so? No, his pleasure soon
turned to anguish and bitterness of spirit: his soul was[152]
overwhelmed with sorrow: the waves went over his head:
(Psalm li. lxxvii. xlii. 7:) he was consumed within him:
he was stuck in the mire and clay; he cried, he wept:
yea, his eyes were as a fountain of tears. (Ibid. lxix. 2,
14.) Guiltiness was upon him, and he must be purged;
his sins washed white as snow, that were as red as
crimson, or he is undone for ever. His repentance prevailed:
behold, what work this part of covetousness
makes! What evil! What sorrow! O that the people of
this covetousness would let the sense of David's sorrow
sink deep into their souls, that they might come to David's
salvation! Restore me, saith that good man: it seems he
once knew a better state: yes, and this may teach the
better sort to fear, and stand in awe too, lest they sin and
fall. For David was taken at a disadvantage; he was off
his watch, and gone from the cross; the law was not his
lamp and light, at that instant; he was a wanderer from
his safety, his strong tower, and so surprised: then and
there it was the enemy met him, and vanquished him.

IV. The second instance is that of Naboth's vineyard:
(1 Kings, xxi.:) it was coveted by Ahab and Jezebel:
that, which led them to such an unlawful desire, found
means to accomplish it. Naboth must die, for he would
not sell it. To do it they accuse the innocent man of
blasphemy, and find two knights of the post, sons of
Belial, to evidence against him. Thus, in the name of
God, and in show of pure zeal to his glory, Naboth must
die; and accordingly was stoned to death. The news of
which coming to Jezebel, she bid Ahab arise and take
possession, for Naboth was dead. But God followed both
of them with his fierce vengeance. "In the place where
the dogs licked the blood of Naboth," said Elijah, in the
name of the Lord, "shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine;
and I will bring evil upon thee, and take away thy posterity;"
and of Jezebel, his wife and partner in his covetousness[153]
and murder, he adds, "The dogs shall eat her
flesh by the walls of Jezreel." Here is the infamy and
punishment due to this part of covetousness. Let this
deter those that desire unlawful things, the rights of
others: for God that is just, will certainly repay such
with interest in the end. But perhaps these are few;
either that they do not, or dare not show it, because the
law will bite if they do. But the next part hath company
enough, that will yet exclaim against the iniquity of this
part of covetousness; and by their seeming abhorrence of
it, would excuse themselves of all guilt in the rest: let us
consider that.

V. The next, and most common part of covetousness is
the unlawful desire of lawful things; especially of riches.
Money is lawful, but the love of it is the root of all evil.
So riches are lawful, but they that pursue them, fall into
divers temptations, snares, and lusts; He calls them uncertain,
to show their folly and danger, that set their hearts
upon them. Covetousness is hateful to God; he hath
denounced great judgments upon those that are guilty of
it. God charged it on Israel of old, as one of the reasons
of his judgments; "For the iniquity of his covetousness,"
saith God, "was I wroth and smote him." (Isai. lvii.
17.) In another place, "Every one is given to covetousness,
and from the prophet to the priest, every one dealeth
falsely;" (Jer. vi. 13;) "therefore will I give their wives
unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit
them." (Ibid. viii. 10.) In another place God complained
thus: "But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy
covetousness." (Chap. xxii. 17.) By Ezekiel, God
renews and repeats his complaint against their covetousness:
"And they come to thee as the people cometh, and sit
before thee as my people: they hear thy words, but will
not do them; with their mouths they show much love,
but their heart goeth after their covetousness." (Ezek.[154]
xxxiii. 31.) Therefore God, in the choice of magistrates,
made it part of their qualification, to hate covetousness;
foreseeing the mischief that would follow to that society
or government where covetous men were in power; that
self would bias them, and they would seek their own ends
at the cost of the public. David desired, that his heart
might not incline to covetousness, but to the testimonies of
his God. (Psalm cxix. 36.) And the wise man expressly
tells us, that "he that hateth covetousness shall prolong
his days:" (Prov. xxviii. 16:) making a curse to follow
it. And it is by Luke charged upon the Pharisees as a
mark of their wickedness: and Christ, in that evangelist,
bids his followers "Take heed and beware of covetousness:"
(Luke, xii. 15:) and he giveth a reason for it that
carrieth a most excellent instruction in it; for, saith he,
"a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
which he possesseth:" (Mark, vii. 21, 22:) but he goeth
further; he joins covetousness with adultery, murder, and
blasphemy. No wonder then if the apostle Paul is so
liberal in his censure of this evil: he placeth it with all
unrighteousness, to the Romans; to the Ephesians he
writeth the like, adding, "Let not covetousness be so
much as named among you:" (Rom. i. 29; Eph. v. 3:)
and bids the Colossians mortify their members; (Col. iii.
5;) and names several sins, as fornication, uncleanness, and
such like, but ends with covetousness: which, saith he, is
idolatry. And we know there is not a greater offence against
God: nay, this very apostle calls "the love of money the
root of all evil;" "which," said he, "whilst some have
coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced
themselves through with many sorrows. For they that
will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and many
foolish and hurtful lusts. O man of God," saith he to his beloved
friend Timothy, "flee these things, and follow after righteousness,
faith, patience, and meekness," (1 Tim. vi. 9-11.)

[155]

VI. Peter was of the same mind; for he maketh covetousness
to be one of the great marks of the false prophets
and teachers that should arise among Christians, and by
that they might know them, "who," saith he, "through
covetousness shall with feigned words make merchandise
of you." (2 Peter, ii. 3.) To conclude, therefore, the
author to the Hebrews, at the end of his epistle, leaves
this, with other things, not without great zeal and weight
upon them: "Let," says he, "your conversation be without
covetousness;" (Heb. xiii. 5;) he rests not in this
generality, but goes on, "and be content with such things
as ye have; for God hath said, I will never leave thee nor
forsake thee." What then? Must we conclude that
those who are not content, but seek to be rich, have forsaken
God? The conclusion seems hard; but yet it is
natural; for such, it is plain, are not content with what
they have; they would have more: they covet to be rich,
if they may: they live not with that dependence and
regard to Providence to which they are exhorted, nor is
godliness, with content, great gain to them.

VII. And truly it is a reproach to a man, especially to
a religious man, that he knows not when he hath enough;
when to leave off; when to be satisfied: that notwithstanding
God sends him one plentiful season of grain after
another, he is so far from making that the cause of withdrawing
from the traffic of the world, that he makes it a
reason for launching further into it; as if the more he
hath, the more he may. He therefore reneweth his appetite,
bestirs himself more than ever, that he may have a
share in the scramble, while anything is to be got: this is
as if cumber, not retirement; and gain, not content, were
the duty and comfort of a Christian. O that this thing
were better considered! for by not being so observable
nor obnoxious to the law, as other vices are, there is more
danger for want of that check. It is plain that most[156]
people strive not for substance, but for wealth. Some
there be that love it strongly, and spend it liberally when
they have got it. Though this be sinful, yet more commendable
than to love money for money's sake; that is
one of the basest passions the mind of man can be captivated
with; a perfect lust; and a greater, and more soul-defiling
one there is not in the whole catalogue of concupiscence.
Which considered, should quicken people into a
serious examination, how far this temptation of love of
money hath entered them; and the rather because the
steps it maketh into the mind, are almost insensible, which
renders the danger greater. Thousands think themselves
unconcerned in the caution, that yet are perfectly guilty
of the evil. Now can it be otherwise, when those that
have, from a low condition, acquired thousands, labour yet
to advance, yea, double and treble those thousands; and
that with the same care and contrivance by which they
got them? Is this to live comfortably, or to be rich? Do
we not see how early they rise; how late they go to bed?
How full of the change, the shop, the warehouse, the
custom-house; of bills, bonds, charter-parties, &amp;c. they
are? Running up and down, as if it were to save the life
of a condemned innocent. An insatiable lust, and therein
ungrateful to God, as well as hurtful to men, who giveth it
to them to use, and not to love: that is, the abuse. And
if this care, contrivance, and industry, and that continually,
be not from the love of money in those that have ten
times more than they began with, and much more than
they spend or need, I know not what testimony man can
give of his love for anything.

VIII. To conclude: It is an enemy to government in
magistrates; for it tends to corruption. Wherefore those
that God ordained were such as feared Him and hated
covetousness. Next, it hurts society: for old traders keep
the young ones poor: and the great reason why some[157]
have too little, and so are forced to drudge like slaves to
feed their families, and keep their chin above the water, is,
because the rich hold fast and press to be richer, and
covet more, which dries up the little streams of profit from
smaller folks. There should be a standard, both as to the
value and time of traffic; and then the trade of the master
to be shared among his servants that deserve it. This
were both to help the young to get their livelihood, and
to give the old time to think of leaving this world well, in
which they have been so busy, that they might obtain
a share in the other, of which they have been so careless.

IX. There is yet another mischief to government; for
covetousness leads men to abuse and defraud it, by concealing
or falsifying the goods they deal in: as bringing
in forbidden goods by stealth: or lawful goods, so as to
avoid the payment of dues, or owning the goods of enemies
for gain; or that they are not well made, or full of
measure; with abundance of that sort of deceit.

X. But covetousness has caused destructive feuds in
families; for estates falling into the hands of those whose
avarice has put them upon drawing greater profit to themselves
than was consistent with justice, has given birth to
much trouble, and caused great oppression; it too often
falling out, that such executors have kept the right
owners out of possession with the money they should pay
them.

XI. But this is not all; for covetousness betrays friendship;
a bribe cannot be better placed to do an ill thing,
or undo a man. Nay, it is too often a murderer both of
soul and body; of the soul, because it kills that life it
should have in God: where money masters the mind, it
extinguishes all love to better things: of the body, for it
will kill for money, by assassinations, poisons, false witness,
&amp;c. I shall end this head on covetousness, with the[158]
sin and doom of two covetous men, Judas, and Simon the
sorcerer.

Judas's religion fell in thorny ground: love of money
choked him. Pride and anger in the Jews endeavoured
to murder Christ; but till covetousness set her hand to
effect it, they were all at a loss. They found Judas had
the bag, and probably loved money; they would try him,
and did. The price was set, and Judas betrays his Master,
his Lord, into the hands of his most cruel adversaries.
But to do him right he returned the money, and to be
revenged on himself, was his own hangman. A wicked
act, a wicked end. Come on, you covetous: what say
you now to brother Judas? was he not an ill man? did
he not very wickedly? Yes, yes: would you have done
so? No, no: by no means. Very well; but so said
those wicked Jews of stoning the prophets, and that yet
crucified the beloved Son of God; He that came to save
them, and would have done it, if they had received Him,
and not rejected the day of their visitation. Rub your
eyes well, for the dust is got into them; and carefully read
in your own consciences, and see if, out of love to money,
you have not betrayed the Just One in yourselves, and so
are brethren with Judas in iniquity. I speak for God
against an idol; bear with me. Have you not resisted,
yea, quenched the good Spirit of Christ in your pursuit
after your beloved wealth? Examine yourselves, try
yourselves; know ye not your own selves: if Christ dwell
not, if He rule not, and be not above all beloved in you,
ye are reprobates: in an undone condition! (2 Cor.
xiii. 5.)

XII. The other covetous man is Simon the sorcerer, a
believer too: but his faith could not go deep enough for
covetousness. (Acts, viii. 9-24.) He would have driven
a bargain with Peter: so much money for so much Holy
Ghost; that he might sell it again, and make a good trade[159]
of it; corruptly measuring Peter by himself, as if he had
only a better knack of cozening the people than himself,
who had set up in Samaria for the great power of God,
before the power of God in Philip and Peter undeceived
the people. But what was Peter's answer and
judgment? "Thy money," says he, "perish with thee;
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: thou art in the
gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity." A dismal
sentence. Besides, covetousness tends to luxury, and
rises often out of it: for from having much, they spend
much, and so become poor by luxury: such are covetous
to get, to spend more, which temperance would prevent.
For if men would not, or could not, by good laws well
executed, and a better education, be so lavish in their
tables, houses, furniture, apparel, and gaming, there would
be no such temptation to covet earnestly after what they
could not spend: for there is but here and there a miser
that loves money for money's sake.

XIII. Which leads to the last and basest part of covetousness,
which is yet the most sordid, to wit, hoarding up,
or keeping money unprofitably, both to others and themselves
too. This is Solomon's miser, that makes himself
rich, and hath nothing: (Prov. xiii. 7:) a great sin in the
sight of God. He complained of such as had stored up
the labours of the poor in their houses; he calls it their
spoils, and it is a grinding of the poor, because they see it
not again. But he blesseth those that consider the poor,
and commandeth every one, to open freely to his brother
that is in need; (Psalm xli. 1; Deut. xv. 7, 8;) not only
he that is spiritually, but naturally so; and not to withhold
his gift from the poor. The apostle chargeth
Timothy, in the sight of God, and before Jesus Christ,
that "he fail not to charge them that are rich in this
world, that they trust not in their uncertain riches, but in
the living God, who giveth liberally; and that they do[160]
good with them, that they may be rich in good works."
(1 Tim. vi. 17, 18.) Riches are apt to corrupt; and that
which keeps them sweet and best is charity: he that uses
them not gets them not for the end for which they are
given, but loves them for themselves, and not their service.
The miser is poor in his wealth: he wants for fear of
spending; and increases his fear with his hope, which is
his gain; and so tortures himself with his pleasure; the
most like to the man that hid his talent in a napkin, of all
others, for this man's talents are hid in his bags out of
sight, in vaults, under boards, behind wainscots: else upon
bonds and mortgages, growing but as underground; for it
is good to none.

XIV. The covetous man hates all useful arts and
sciences as vain, lest they should cost him something the
learning: wherefore ingenuity has no more place in his
mind than in his pocket. He lets houses fall, to prevent
the charge of repairs: and for his spare diet, plain clothes,
and mean furniture, he would place them to the account of
moderation. O monster of a man! that can take up the
cross for covetousness, and not for Christ.

XV. But he pretends negatively to some religion too;
for he always rails at prodigality, the better to cover his
avarice. If you would bestow a box of spikenard on a
good man's head; to save money, and to seem righteous,
he tells you of the poor: but if the poor come, he excuses
his want of charity with the unworthiness of the object, or
the causes of his poverty, or that he can bestow his money
upon those that deserve it better; who rarely opens his
purse till quarter-day for fear of losing it.

XVI. But he is more miserable than the poorest; for
he enjoys not what he yet fears to lose; they fear not
what they do not enjoy. Thus is he poor by overvaluing
his wealth: but he is wretched that hungers with money
in a cook's shop: yet having made a god of his[161]
gold, who knows, but he thinks it unnatural to eat what
he worships?

XVII. But, which aggravates this sin, I have myself
once known some, that to get money have wearied themselves
into the grave; and to be true to their principle,
when sick would not spare a fee to a doctor, to help the
poor slave to live; and so died to save charges: a constancy
that canonizes them martyrs for money.

XVIII. But now let us see what instances the Scripture
will give us in reproof of the sordid hoarders and hiders
of money. A good-like young man came to Christ, and
inquired the way to eternal life: Christ told him, he knew
the commandments: he replied, he had kept them from
his youth: it seems he was no loose person, and indeed
such are usually not so, to save charges. And "yet
lackest thou one thing," saith Christ; "sell all, distribute
it to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and
come and follow Me." It seems Christ pinched him in
the sore place; He hit the mark, and struck him to the
heart: who knew his heart; by this He tried how well he
had kept the commandment, "To love God above all."
It was said, the young man was very sorrowful, and went
his way; and the reason which is given is, that he was
very rich. The tides met, money and eternal life: contrary
desires: but which prevailed? Alas! his riches.
But what said Christ to this? How hardly shall they
that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! He adds,
"It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven:" that is,
such a rich man, to wit, a covetous rich man, to whom it
is hard to do good with what he has: it is more than a
miracle: O who then would be rich and covetous! It
was upon these rich men that Christ pronounced his woe,
saying, "Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received
your consolation here." What! none in the heavens?[162]
No, unless you become willing to be poor men, can resign
all, live loose to the world, have it at arm's end, yea, under
foot; a servant, and not a master.

XIX. The other instance is a very dismal one too: it is
that of Ananias and Sapphira. In the beginning of the
apostolical times, it was customary for those who received
the word of life, to bring what substance they had and lay
it at the apostles' feet: of these Joses, surnamed Barnabas,
was exemplary. Among the rest, Ananias and his wife
Sapphira, confessing to the truth, sold their possession,
but covetously reserved some of the purchase-money from
the common purse to themselves, and brought a part for
the whole, and laid it at the apostles' feet. But Peter, a
plain and bold man, in the majesty of the Spirit, said,
"Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the
Holy Ghost; and to keep back part of the price of the
land? Whilst it remained, was it not thine own? And
after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why
hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? Thou hast
not lied unto men, but unto God." (Acts, v. 3, 4.) But
what followed this covetousness and hypocrisy of Ananias?
Why, "Ananias hearing these words, fell down, and gave
up the ghost." The like befel his wife, being privy to the
deceit their avarice had led them to. And it is said, that
"great fear came upon all the church, and those that
heard of these things:" and also should on those that
now read them. For if this judgment was shown and
recorded that we should beware of the like evils, what
will become of those who, under the profession of Christianity,
a religion that teaches men to live loose from the
world, and to yield up all to the will and service of Christ
and his kingdom, not only retain a part, but all; and
cannot part with the least thing for Christ's sake? I
beseech God to incline the hearts of my readers to weigh
these things. This had not befallen Ananias and Sapphira,[163]
if they had acted as in God's presence, and with that
entire love, truth, and sincerity that became them. O
that people would use the light that Christ has given
them, to search and see how far they are under the power
of this iniquity! For would they but watch against the
love of the world, and be less in bondage to the things
that are seen, which are temporal, they would begin to
set their hearts on things above, that are of an eternal
nature. Their life would be hid with Christ in God, out
of the reach of all the uncertainties of time, and troubles,
and changes of mortality. Nay, if people would but consider
how hardly riches are got, how uncertainly they are
kept, the envy they bring; that they can neither make a
man wise, nor cure diseases, nor add to life, much less
give peace in death; no, nor hardly yield any solid benefit
above food or raiment, (which may be had without them,)
and that if there be any good use for them, it is to relieve
others in distress; being but stewards of the plentiful providences
of God, and consequently accountable for our
stewardship; if, I say, these considerations had any room
in our minds, we should not thus post to get, nor care to
hide and keep such a mean and impotent thing. O that
the cross of Christ, which is the Spirit and power
of God in man, might have more place in the soul,
that it might crucify us more and more to the world, and
the world to us; that, like the days of paradise, the earth
might again be the footstool, and the treasure of the earth
a servant, and not a god to man!&mdash;Many have written
against this vice; three I will mention.

XX. William Tindall, that worthy apostle of the
English reformation, has an entire discourse, to which I
refer the reader, entitled, "The Parable of the Wicked
Mammon." The next is&mdash;&mdash;

XXI. Peter Charron, a famous Frenchman, and in particular
for the book he wrote of wisdom, hath a chapter[164]
against covetousness; part of which take as followeth:
"To love and affect riches is covetousness: not only the
love and affection, but also every over-curious care and
industry about riches. The desire of goods, and the pleasure
we take in possessing them, are grounded only upon
opinion: the immoderate desire to get riches is a gangrene
in our soul, which with a venomous heat consumeth our
natural affections, to the end it might fill us with virulent
humours. So soon as it is lodged in our hearts, all honest
and natural affection, which we owe either to our parents,
our friends, or ourselves, vanisheth away: all the rest, in
respect of our profit, seemeth nothing; yea, we forget in
the end, and condemn ourselves, our bodies, our minds,
for this transitory trash; and as our proverb is, We sell
our horse to get us hay. Covetousness is the vile and
base passion of vulgar fools, who account riches the principal
good of a man, and fear poverty as the greatest evil;
and not contenting themselves with necessary means,
which are forbidden no man, weigh that which is good in
a goldsmith's balance; when nature hath taught us to
measure it by the ell of necessity. For, what greater folly
can there be than to adore that which nature itself hath
put under our feet, and hidden in the earth, as unworthy
to be seen; yea, rather to be contemned, and trampled
under foot? This is that which the sin of man hath only
torn out of the entrails of the earth, and brought unto
light to kill himself. We dig out the earth, and bring to
light those things for which we would fight: we are not
ashamed to esteem those things most highly which are in
the lowest parts of the earth. Nature seemeth even in the
first birth of gold, after a sort, to have presaged the misery
of those that are in love with it; for it hath so ordered
the matter, that in those countries where it groweth there
groweth with it neither grass nor plant, nor other thing
that is worth anything: as giving us to understand[165]
thereby, that in those minds where the desire of this
metal groweth, there cannot remain so much as a spark of
true honour and virtue. For what thing can be more base
than for a man to degrade, and to make himself a servant
and a slave to that which should be subject unto him?
Riches serve wise men, but command a fool: for a covetous
man serveth his riches, and not they him: and he is
said to have goods as he hath a fever, which holdeth and
tyrannizeth over a man, not he over it. What thing more
vile, than to love that which is not good, neither can make
a good man? Yea is common, and in the possession of
the most wicked in the world; which many times perverts
good manners, but never amends them: without which, so
many wise men have made themselves happy; and by
which so many wicked men have come to a wicked end.
To be brief; what thing more miserable, than to bind the
living to the dead, as Mezentius did, to the end their
death might be languishing, and the more cruel; to tie
the spirit unto the excrement and scum of the earth; to
pierce through his own soul with a thousand torments,
which this amorous passion of riches brings with it; and
to entangle himself with the ties and cords of this malignant
thing, as the Scripture calls them, which doth likewise
term them thorns and thieves, which steal away the
heart of man, snares of the devil, idolatry, and the root of
all evil? And truly he that shall see the catalogue of those
envies and molestations which riches engender into the
heart of man, as their proper thunderbolt and lightning,
they would be more hated than they are now loved.
Poverty wants many things, but covetousness all: a covetous
man is good to none, but worse to himself." Thus
much of Charron, a wise and great man. My next testimony
is yielded by an author not unlikely to take with
some sort of people for his wit; may they equally value
his morality, and the judgment of his riper time.

[166]

XXII. Abraham Cowley, a witty and ingenious man,
yieldeth us the other testimony: of avarice he writeth
thus: "There are two sorts of avarice, the one is but a
bastard-kind, and that is a rapacious appetite of gain;
not for its own sake, but for the pleasure of refunding it
immediately through all the channels of pride and luxury.
The other is the true kind, and properly so called, which
is a restless and insatiable desire of riches, not for any
further end or use, but only to hoard and preserve, and
perpetually increase them. The covetous man of the first
kind, is like a greedy ostrich, which devoureth any metal,
but it is with an intent to feed upon it, and in effect, it
maketh a shift to digest and excern it. The second is
like the foolish chough, which loveth to steal money, only
to hide it. The first doth much harm to mankind, and
a little good to some few: the second doth good to none;
no, not to himself. The first can make no excuse to God
or angels, or rational men, for his actions: the second can
give no reason or colour, not to the devil himself, for what
he doth: he is a slave to mammon without wages. The
first maketh a shift to be beloved, aye, and envied too, by
some people: the second is the universal object of hatred
and contempt. There is no vice hath been so pelted with
good sentences, and especially by the poets, who have
pursued it with satires and fables, and allegories and allusions,
and moved, as we say, every stone to fling at it;
among which I do not remember a finer correction than
that which was given it by one line of Ovid's:

 
  
    Multa
    Luxuri&aelig; desunt, omnia avariti&aelig;."
  
 

Which is,


"Much is wanting to luxury, all to avarice."


To which saying I have a mind to add one member, and
render it thus: poverty wants some, luxury many, avarice[167]
all things. Somebody saith of a virtuous and wise man
that having nothing, he hath all. This is just his antipode,
who having all things, yet hath nothing.


  
    And O! what man's condition can be worse
    Than his, whom plenty starves, and blessings curse?
    The beggars but a common fate deplore,
    The rich poor man's emphatically poor.
  
 

"I wonder how it cometh to pass, that there hath never
been any law made against him: against him do I say?
I mean for him. As there are public provisions made for
all other madmen, it is very reasonable that the king
should appoint some persons to manage his estate, during
his life, for his heirs commonly need not that care, and
out of it to make it their business to see that he should
not want alimony befitting their condition; which he
could never get out of his own cruel fingers. We relieve
idle vagrants and counterfeit beggars, but have no care
at all of these really poor men, who are, methinks, to be
respectfully treated, in regard of their quality. I might
be endless against them, but I am almost choked with the
superabundance of the matter. Too much plenty impoverisheth
me, as it doth them." Thus much against
avarice, that moth of the soul, and canker of the mind.



[168]




CHAPTER XIV.



1. Luxury, what it is, and the mischief of it to mankind. An
enemy to the cross of Christ.&mdash;2. Of luxury in diet, how unlike
Christ, and contrary to Scripture.&mdash;3. The mischief it does to
the bodies, as well as the minds of people.&mdash;4. Of luxury in the
excess of apparel, and of recreations; that sin brought the first
coat: people not to be proud of the badge of their misery.&mdash;5.
The recreations of the times, enemies to virtue: they rise from
degeneracy.&mdash;6. The end of clothes allowable; the abuse reprehended.&mdash;7.
The chief recreation of good men of old was to serve
God, and do good to mankind, and follow honest vocations, not
vain sports and pastimes.&mdash;8. The Heathen knew and did better
things. The sobriety of infidels above Christians.&mdash;9. Luxury
condemned in the case of the rich man.&mdash;10. The doctrine of the
Scripture positively against a voluptuous life.


I. I am now come to the other extreme, and that is luxury,
which is an excessive indulgence of self, in ease and
pleasure. This is the last great impiety struck at in this
discourse of the holy cross of Christ, which indeed is
much the subject of its mortifying virtue and power. A
disease as epidemical, as killing: it creeps into all stations
and ranks of men: the poorest often exceeding their
ability to indulge their appetite; and the rich frequently
wallowing in those things that please the lusts of their
eye and flesh, and the pride of life: as regardless of the
severe discipline of JESUS, whom they call Saviour, as if
luxury, and not the cross, were the ordained way to
heaven. What shall we eat, what shall we drink, and
what shall we put on? once the care of luxurious heathens,
is now the practice of, and which is worse, the study of[169]
pretended Christians. But let such be ashamed, and
repent; remembering that Jesus did not reproach the
Gentiles for those things, to indulge his followers in them.
They that will have Christ to be theirs, must be sure to
be his; to be like-minded, to live in temperance and moderation,
as knowing the Lord is at hand. Sumptuous
apparel, rich unguents, delicate washes, stately furniture,
costly cookery, and such diversions as balls, masques,
music-meetings, plays, romances, &amp;c., which are the
delight and entertainment of the times, belong not to the
holy path that Jesus and his true disciples and followers
trod to glory. No, "Through many tribulations," says
none of the least of them, "must we enter the kingdom of
God." (Acts, xiv. 22.) I do earnestly beseech the gay
and luxurious, into whose hands this discourse shall be
directed, to consider well the reasons and examples here
advanced against their way of living; if happily they may
come to see how remote it is from true Christianity, and
how dangerous to their eternal peace. God Almighty, by
his grace, soften their hearts to instruction, and shed
abroad his tender love in their souls, that they may be
overcome to repentance, and to the love of the holy way
of the cross of Jesus, the blessed Redeemer of men. For
they cannot think that He can benefit them, while they
refuse to lay down their sins for the love of Him that laid
down his life for the love of them. Or that He will give
them a place in heaven, that refuse Him any in their hearts
on earth. But let us examine luxury in all its parts.

II. Luxury has many parts; the first that is forbidden
by the self-denying Jesus, is gluttony, "Take no thought,
saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink?&mdash;for
after these things do the Gentiles seek:" (Mat. vi. 31,
32:) as if He had said, The Heathen, such as live without
the true God, whose care is to please their appetite, more
than to seek God and his kingdom: you must not do so,[170]
but "seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,
and all these things shall be added unto you."
(Mat. vi. 33.) That which is convenient for you will
follow: let everything have its time and order.

This carries a serious reprehension to the luxurious
eater and drinker, who is taken up with an excessive care
of his palate, what shall he eat, and what shall he drink:
who being often at a loss what to have next, therefore has
an officer to invent, and a cook to dress, disguise, and
drown the species, that it may cheat the eye, look new
and strange; and all to excite an appetite, or raise an
admiration. To be sure there is great variety, and that
curious and costly; the sauce, it may be, dearer than the
meat; and so full is he fed, that without it he can scarce
find out a stomach; which is to force a hunger, rather
than to satisfy it.&mdash;And as he eats, so he drinks: rarely
for thirst, but pleasure: to please his palate. For that
purpose he will have divers sorts, and he must taste them
all: one, however good, is dull and tiresome; variety is
more delightful than the best; and therefore the whole
world is little enough to fill his cellar. But were he temperate
in his proportions, his variety might be imputed
rather to curiosity than luxury. But what the temperate
man uses as a cordial, he drinks by full draughts, till inflamed
by excess, he is fitted to be an instrument of
mischief, if not to other persons, yet always to himself,
whom perhaps at last he knows not: for such brutality are
some come to, they will sip themselves out of their own
knowledge. This is the lust of the flesh, that is not of
the Father, but of the world; for upon this comes in the
music and dance, and mirth, and the laughter, which is
madness; (Eccl. ii. 2;) that the noise of one pleasure may
drown the iniquity of another, lest his own heart should
deal too plainly with him. Thus the luxurious live: they
forget God, they regard not the afflicted. O that the sons[171]
and daughters of men would consider their wantonness
and their iniquity in these things! How ill do they requite
the goodness of God in the use and abuse of the plenty
He yields them! How cruel are they to his creatures, how
lavish of their lives and virtue, how thankless for them:
forgetting the Giver, and abusing his gifts, and despising
counsel, and casting instruction behind them! They lose
tenderness and forget duty, being swallowed up of voluptuousness,
adding one excess to another. God rebuked
this sin in the Jews, by the prophet Amos: "Ye that put
far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come
near; that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves
upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock,
and the calves out of the stall; that chant to the sound of
the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music,
like David; that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves
with the chief ointments; but they are not grieved
for the affliction of Joseph." (Amos, vi. 3-6.) These,
it seems, were the vices of the degenerate Jews, under all
their pretence to religion; and are they not of Christians
at this day? Yea they are, and these are the great parts
of luxury struck at in this discourse. Remember the rich
man, with all his sumptuous fare, went to hell: and the
apostle pronounces heavy woes upon those "whose god
is their belly: for such glory in their shame." (Phil. iii.
19.)

Christ places these things to the courts of worldly
kings, not his kingdom: making them unseemly in his
followers: his feast therefore, to the multitude, which was
his miracle, was plain and simple; enough, but without
curiosity or art of cookery: and it went down well, for
they were hungry; the best and fittest time to eat. And
the apostle, in his directions to his much-beloved Timothy,
debases the lovers of worldly fulness; advising him to
godliness and content as the chiefest gain: adding, "and[172]
having food and raiment, let us therewith be content."
(1 Tim. vi. 6, 8.) Behold the abstemious, and most contented
life of those pilgrims, the sons of heaven, and immortal
offspring of the great power of God; they were in
fasts and perils often, and ate what was set before them;
and in all conditions learned to be contented. O blessed
men! O blessed spirits! Let my soul dwell with yours for
ever.

III. But the diseases which luxury begets and nourishes,
make it an enemy to mankind: for besides the mischief it
brings to the souls of people, it undermines health, and
shortens the life of man, in that it gives but ill nourishment
and so leaves and feeds corrupt humours, whereby the
body becomes rank and foul, lazy and scorbutic; unfit for
exercise, and more for honest labour. The spirits being
thus loaded with ill flesh, and the mind effeminated, a
man is made inactive, and so useless in civil society; for
idleness follows luxury, as well as diseases. These are
the burdens of the world, devourers of good things, self-lovers,
and so forgetters of God: but which is sad, and
yet just, the end of those that forget God, is to be turned
into hell. (Psalm ix. 19.)

IV. But there is another part of luxury that has great
place with vain man and woman, and that is the gorgeousness
of apparel, one of the most foolish, because most
costly, empty, and unprofitable excesses people can well
be guilty of.

V. Nor is it otherwise with recreations, as they call
them; for these are nearly related. Man was made a
noble, rational, grave creature; his pleasure stood in his
duty, and his duty in obeying God: which is to love, fear,
adore, and serve Him; and in using the creation with true
temperance and godly moderation; as knowing well that
the Lord, his judge, was at hand, the inspector and rewarder
of his works. In short, his happiness was in his communion[173]
with God; his error was to leave that conversation,
and let his eyes wander abroad to gaze on transitory
things. If the recreations of the age were as pleasant
and necessary as they are said and made to be, unhappy
then would Adam and Eve have been, that never knew
them. But had they never fallen, and the world been
tainted by their folly and ill example, perhaps man had
never known the necessity or use of many of these things.
Sin gave them birth, as it did the other; they were afraid
of the presence of the Lord, which was the joy of their
innocency, when they had sinned; and then their minds
wandered, sought other pleasures, and began to forget
God; as He complained afterwards by the prophet Amos,
"They put far away the evil day: they eat the fat of the
flock: they drink wine in bowls: they anoint themselves
with the chief perfumes: they stretch themselves upon
beds of ivory: they chant to the sound of the viol, and
invent upon themselves instruments of music, like David,"
(Amos, vi. 3-6,) not heeding or remembering the afflictions
and captivity of poor Joseph: him they wickedly
sold, innocency was quite banished, and shame soon began
to grow a custom, till they were grown shameless in the
imitation. And truly, it is now no less a shame to approach
primitive innocence by modest plainness, than it was
matter of shame to Adam that he lost it, and became
forced to tack fig-leaves for a covering. Wherefore in
vain do men and women deck themselves with specious
pretences to religion, and flatter their miserable souls with
the fair titles of Christian, innocent, good, virtuous, and
the like, whilst such vanities and follies reign. Wherefore
to you all, from the eternal God, I am bound to declare,
you mock Him that will not be mocked, and deceive
yourselves; (Gal. vi. 7;) such intemperance must be
denied, and you must know yourselves changed, and more
nearly approached to primitive purity, before you can be[174]
entitled to what you do now but usurp; for none but
those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children
of God, (Rom. viii. 14; Gal. v. 23,) which guides into
all temperance and meekness.

VI. But the Christian world, as it would be called, is
justly reprovable, because the very end of the first institution
of apparel is grossly perverted. The utmost service
that clothes originally were designed for, when sin had
stripped them of their native innocence, was, as hath been
said, to cover them; therefore plain and modest: next, to
fence out cold; therefore substantial: lastly, to declare
sexes; therefore distinguishing. So that then necessity
provoked to clothing, now, pride and vain curiosity; in
former times some benefit obliged, but now, wantonness
and pleasure: then they minded them for covering, but
now, that is the least part; their greedy eyes must be
provided with gaudy superfluities: as if they made their
clothes for trimming, to be seen rather than worn; only
for the sake of other curiosities that must be tacked upon
them, although they neither fence from cold, nor distinguish
sexes; but signally display their wanton, fantastic,
full-fed minds, that have them.

VII. Then the recreations were to serve God, be just,
follow their vocations, mind their flocks, do good, exercise
their bodies in such a manner as was suitable to gravity,
temperance, and virtue; but now that word is extended
to almost every folly; so much are men degenerated from
Adam in his disobedience; so much more confident and
artificial are they grown in all impieties: yea, their
minds, through custom, are become so very insensible of
the inconveniency that attends the like follies, that what
was once mere necessity, is now the delight, pleasure, and
recreation of age. How ignoble is it, how ignominious
and unworthy of a reasonable creature! Man, who is endued
with understanding, fit to contemplate immortality,[175]
and made a companion (if not superior) to angels, that he
should mind a little dust, a few shameful rags; inventions
of mere pride and luxury; toys so apish and fantastic,
entertainments so dull and earthly, that a rattle, a baby, a
hobby-horse, a top, are by no means so foolish in a simple
child, not unworthy of his thoughts, as are such inventions
of the care and pleasure of men! It is a mark of great
stupidity that such vanities should exercise the noble
mind of man, and image of the great Creator of heaven
and earth.

VIII. Of this many among the very Heathens of old
had so clear a prospect that they detested all such vanity,
looking upon curiosity in apparel, and that variety of
recreations, now in vogue and esteem with false Christians,
to be destructive of good manners, in that it more easily
stole away the minds of people from sobriety to wantonness,
idleness, effeminacy, and made them only companions for
the beast that perishes: witness those famous men, Anaxagoras,
Socrates, Plato, Aristides, Cato, Seneca, Epictetus,
&amp;c., who placed true honour and satisfaction in nothing
below virtue and immortality. Nay, such are the remains
of innocence among some Moors and Indians in our
times, that if a Christian (though he must be an odd one)
fling out a filthy word, it is customary with them, by way
of moral, to bring him water to purge his mouth. How
much do the like virtues and reasonable instances accuse
people, professing Christianity, of gross folly and intemperance!
O that men and women had the fear of God
before their eyes; and that they were so charitable to themselves,
as to remember whence they came, what they are
doing, and to what they must return: that so more noble,
more virtuous, more rational and heavenly things might be
the matters of their pleasure and entertainment; that they
would be once persuaded to believe how inconsistent the
folly, vanity, and conversation they are mostly exercised[176]
in, really are with the true nobility of a reasonable soul;
and let that just principle, which taught the Heathens,
teach them; lest it be found more tolerable for Heathens
than such Christians, in the day of account. For if their
shorter notions, and more imperfect sense of things could
yet discover so much vanity; if their degree of light
condemned it, and they, in obedience thereunto, disused
it, doth it not behove Christians much more?

IX. Again these things, which have been hitherto condemned,
have never been the conversation or practice of
the holy men and women of old times, whom the Scriptures
recommend for holy examples, worthy of imitation.
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were plain men, and princes,
as graziers are, over their families and flocks. They were
not solicitous for the vanities so much lived in by the
people of this generation, for they pleased God by faith.
The first forsook his father's house, kindred, and country;
a true type or figure of that self-denial all must know,
that would have Abraham to their father. They must not
think to live in those pleasures, fashions, and customs
they are called to leave; no, but part with all hopes of the
great recompense of reward, and that better country which
is eternal in the heavens. (Heb. xi. 26, 15; Rom. v. 1.)
The prophets were generally poor; one a shepherd,
another a herdsman, &amp;c. They often cried out unto the
full-fed wanton Israelites to repent, to fear and dread the
living God, to forsake the sins and vanities they lived in;
but they never imitated them. John the Baptist, the messenger
of the Lord, preached his embassy to the world in
a coat of camel's-hair, a rough and homely garment.
(Matt. iii. 4.) Nor can it be conceived that Jesus Christ
himself was much better apparelled, who, according to the
flesh, was of poor descent, and in life, of great plainness;
insomuch that it was usual in a way of derision to say,
"Is not this Jesus, the carpenter, the son of Mary?"[177]
(Matt. xiii. 55; Mark, vi. 3.) And this Jesus tells his
followers, "That as for soft raiment, gorgeous apparel and
delicacies, they were for king's courts:" (Luke, vii. 25:)
implying, that He and his followers were not to seek after
those things; but seems thereby to express the great
difference that was betwixt the lovers of the fashions and
customs of the world, and those whom He had chosen out
of it. And He did not only come in that mean and despicable
manner himself, that He might stain the pride of
all flesh, but therein became exemplary to his followers,
what a self-denying life they must lead, if they would be
his true disciples. Nay, He further leaves it with them
in a parable, to the end that it might make the deeper
impression, and that they might see how inconsistent a
pompous, worldly-pleasing life is with the kingdom He
came to establish and call men to the possession of: and
that is the remarkable story of Dives, who is represented
first, as a rich man; (Luke, xvi. 19. &amp;c.;) next as a voluptuous
man, in his rich apparel, his many dishes, and
his pack of dogs; and lastly, as an uncharitable man, or
one who was more concerned to please the lust of the eye,
the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, and fare sumptuously
every day, than to take compassion of poor
Lazarus at his gate: no, his dogs were more pitiful and
kind than he. But what was the doom of this jolly man,
this great rich man? We read it was everlasting torment;
but that of Lazarus, eternal joy with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, in the kingdom of God. In short, Lazarus was a
good man, the other a great man: the one poor and temperate,
the other rich and luxurious: there are too many
of them alive; and it were well, if his doom might awaken
them to repentance.

X. Nor were the twelve apostles, the immediate messengers
of the Lord Jesus Christ, other than poor men, one a
fisherman, another a tent-maker; and he that was of the[178]
greatest, though perhaps not the best employment, was a
custom-gatherer. (Matt. iv. 18; ix. 9; Acts, xviii. 3.)
So that it is very unlikely that any of them were followers
of the fashions of the world: nay, they were so far from
it, that, as became the followers of Christ, (1 Cor. iv.
9-14,) they lived poor, afflicted, self-denying lives; bidding
the churches to walk as they had them for examples.
(Phil. iii. 1, 7; 1 Pet. ii. 21.) And to shut up this particular,
they gave this pathetic account of the holy women
in former times, as an example of godly temperance,
(1 Pet. iii. 3, 4,) namely, that first they did expressly
abstain from gold, silver, plaited hair, fine apparel, or such
like; and next, that their adornment was a meek and
quiet spirit, and the hidden man of the heart, which are
of great price with the Lord; affirming that such as live
in pleasure, are dead whilst they live: (1 Tim. v. 6; Luke,
viii. 14:) for that the cares and pleasures of this life choke
and destroy the seed of the kingdom, and quite hinder all
progress in the hidden and divine life. Wherefore we
find that the holy men and women of former times were
not accustomed to these pleasures and vain recreations;
but having their minds set on things above, sought another
kingdom, which consists in righteousness, peace, and joy
in the Holy Spirit: who having obtained a good report,
and entered into their eternal rest; therefore their works
follow, and praise them in the gates. (Rom. xiv. 17;
Heb. xi. 2; iv. 9; Rev. xiv. 13.)



[179]




CHAPTER XV.



1. The judgments of God denounced upon the Jews for their luxury;
all ranks included.&mdash;2. Christ charges his disciples to have a care
of the guilt of it: a supplication to the inhabitants of England.&mdash;3.
Temperance pressed upon the churches by the apostles.&mdash;4. An
exhortation to England to measure herself by that rule.&mdash;5. What
Christian recreations are.&mdash;6. Who need other sports to pass away
their time are unfit for heaven and eternity.&mdash;7. Man has but a
few days: they may be better bestowed: this doctrine is ungrateful
to none that would be truly blessed.&mdash;8. Not only good is
omitted by this luxurious life, but evil committed, as breach of
marriage and love, loss of health and estate, &amp;c. Playhouses and
stages most instrumental to this mischief.&mdash;9. How youth are by
them inflamed to vanity: what mischief comes of revels, gamings,
&amp;c. Below the life of noble heathens.&mdash;10. The true disciples of
Jesus are mortified in these things: the pleasure and reward of a
good employment of time.


I. But such excess in apparel and pleasure was not only
forbidden in Scripture, but it was the ground of that
lamentable message by the prophet Isaiah to the people
of Israel: "Moreover the Lord saith, Because the daughters
of Zion are haughty, and walked with stretched-forth
necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go,
and making a tinkling with their feet; therefore the Lord
will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the
daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover their secret
parts; in that day the Lord will take away the bravery of
their tinkling ornaments, and their cauls, (or net-works in
the Hebrew,) and their round tires like the moon; the
chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers; the bonnets,
and the ornaments of the legs, and the head-bands, and[180]
the tablets, and ear-rings, the rings and nose-jewels; the
changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the
wimples, and the crisping-pins; the glasses, and the
fine linen, and the hoods and the veils; and it shall
come to pass, that instead of sweet smell, there shall be
a stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of
well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher, a
girding of sackcloth, and burning instead of beauty: thy
men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war;
and her gates shall lament and mourn, and she being desolate,
shall sit upon the ground."[4] (Isa. iii. 16-26.)
Behold, O vain and foolish inhabitants of England and
Europe, your folly and your doom! Yet read the prophet
Ezekiel's vision of miserable Tyre, what punishment
her pride and pleasure brought upon her; and amongst
many other circumstances these are some: "These were
thy merchants in all sorts of things; in blue clothes and
broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, emeralds,
purple, fine linen, coral and agate, spices, with all precious
stones, and gold, horses, chariots," &amp;c.; for which
hear part of her doom: "Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy
merchandize, and all thy company, which is in the midst,
of thee, shall fall into the midst of the sea in the
day of thy ruin; and the inhabitant of the isles shall
be astonished at thee; and their merchants hiss at
thee; thou shalt be a terror, and shalt be no more."
(Ezek. xxvii.) Thus hath God declared his displeasure
against the luxury of this wanton world. Yet
further the prophet Zephaniah goes, for thus he speaks:
"And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice,
that I will punish the princes, and the king's children,
and all such as are clothed with strange apparel." (Zeph.[181]
i. 8.) Of how evil consequence was it in those times, for
the greatest men to give themselves the liberty of following
the vain customs of other nations; or of changing the
usual end of clothes, or apparel, to gratify foolish curiosity!

II. This did the Lord Jesus Christ expressly charge his
disciples not to be careful about: insinuating that such as
were could not be his disciples: for, says he, "Take no
thought, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we
drink? or Wherewithal shall we be clothed? for after all
these things do the Gentiles seek: for your heavenly
Father knoweth that you have need of all these things:
but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,
and all these things shall be added unto you."
(Matt. vi. 31-33.) Under which of eating, and drinking,
and apparel, he comprehends all external things
whatsoever; and so much appears, as well because they
are opposed to the kingdom of God and his righteousness,
which are invisible and heavenly things, as those very
matters he enjoins them not to be careful about, are the
most necessary, and the most innocent in themselves. If
then, in such cases, the minds of his disciples were not to
be solicitous; much less in foolish, superstitious, idle
inventions, to gratify the carnal appetites and minds of
men: so certain it is that those who live therein are none
of his followers, but the Gentiles; and as He elsewhere
says, "The nations of the world who know not God."
(Luke, xii. 22-30.) If now then the distinguishing mark
between the disciples of Jesus and those of the world is,
that one minds the things of heaven, and God's kingdom,
that "stands in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy
Ghost;" (Rom. xiv. 17;) being not careful of external
matters, even the most innocent and necessary: and that
the other minds eating, drinking, apparel, and the affairs
of this world, with the lusts, pleasures, profits, and honours[182]
that belong to it; be you intreated for your souls' sakes, O
inhabitants of England, to be serious, to reflect awhile
upon yourselves what care and cost you are at of time and
money, about foolish, nay vicious things: so far are you
degenerated from the primitive Christian life. What
buying and selling, what dealing and chaffering, what
writing and posting, what toil and labour, what noise,
hurry, bustle, and confusion, what study, what little contrivances
and overreachings, what eating, drinking, vanity
of apparel, most ridiculous recreations; in short, what
rising early, going to bed late, expense of precious time
is there about things that perish! View the streets, shops,
exchanges, plays, parks, coffee-houses, &amp;c. and is not the
world, this fading world, written upon every face? Say
not within yourselves, How otherwise should men live
and the world subsist? The common, though frivolous
objection. There is enough for all. Let some content
themselves with less: a few things, plain and decent,
serve a Christian life. It is lust, pride, avarice, that
thrust men upon such folly: were God's kingdom more
the exercise of their minds, these perishing entertainments
would have but little of their time or thoughts.

III. This self-denying doctrine was confirmed and enforced
by the apostles in their example, as we have already shown;
and in their precepts too, as we shall yet evince in those two
most remarkable passages of Paul and Peter; where they do
not only tell us what should be done, but also what should be
denied and avoided: "In like manner I will, that women
adorn themselves in modest apparel; with shamefacedness
and sobriety, not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls,
or costly array (then it seems these are immodest) but
which becometh women professing godliness, with good
works." (1 Tim. ii. 9, 10.) Absolutely implying, that
those who attire themselves with gold, silver, broidered
hair, pearls, costly array, cannot in so doing, be women[183]
professing godliness; making those very things to be
contrary to modesty, and consequently that they are evil, and
unbecoming women professing godliness. To which the
apostle Peter joins another precept after the like sort, viz.
"Whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning
of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, and of putting
on of apparel:" what then? "But let it be the hidden
man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even
the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the
sight of God of great price." (1 Pet. iii. 3-5.) And as
an inducement, he adds: "for after this manner in the old
time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned
themselves." Which doth not only intimate that both
holy women were so adorned, and that it behoves such as
would be holy, and trust in the holy God, to be so adorned;
but also, that they who used those forbidden ornaments,
were the women and people in all ages, that, for all their
talk, were not holy, nor did trust in God. Such are so
far from trusting in God that the apostle Paul expressly
says, that "she that liveth in pleasure is dead whilst she
liveth." (1 Tim. v. 6.) And the same apostle further enjoined,
that Christians should have their conversation in
heaven, and their minds fixed on things above: (Phil. iii.
20; Col. iii. 1-4; Rom. xiii. 13:) "walk honestly as in
the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering
and wantonness, not in envy and strife:" (Eph. v.
3, 4:) "let not fornication, uncleanness, or covetousness
be once named among you: neither filthiness, nor foolish
talking nor jesting, which are not convenient; but rather
giving of thanks:" (Eph. iv. 29:) "let no corrupt communication
proceed out of your mouth, but that which is
good, to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto
the hearers. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."
(Rom. xiii. 14; Eph. iv. 30.) And, "Grieve not the[184]
Holy Spirit; (intimating such conversation doth;) but be ye
followers of God, as dear children: walk circumspectly,
not as fools, but as wise; redeeming the time, because the
days are evil." (Eph. v. 1, 15, 16.)

IV. By this, measure yourselves, O inhabitants of this
land, who think yourselves wronged, if not accounted
Christians: see what proportion your life and spirit bear
with these most holy and self-denying precepts and examples.
Well, my friends, my soul mourns for you: I
have been with and among you; your life and pastime are
not strangers to my notice; and with compassion, yea,
inexpressible pity, I bewail your folly. O that you would
be wise! O that the just principle in yourselves would be
heard! O that eternity had time to plead a little with you!
Why should your beds, your glasses, your clothes, your
tables, your loves, your plays, your parks, your treats,
your recreations, poor perishing joys, have all your souls,
your time, your care, your purse, and consideration? Be
ye admonished, I beseech you, in the name of the living
God, by one that some of you know hath had his share in
these things, and consequently time to know how little
the like vanities conduce to true and solid happiness.
No, my Friends, God Almighty knows, and would to God,
you would believe and follow me, they end in shame and
sorrow. Faithful is that most holy One, who hath determined,
that every man and woman shall reap what they
sow: and will not trouble, anguish, and disappointment
be a sad and dreadful harvest for you to reap, for all your
misspent time and substance, about superfluities and vain
recreations? Retire then; quench not the Holy Spirit in
yourselves; redeem your precious abused time: frequent
such conversation as may help you against your
evil inclinations; so shall you follow the examples, and
keep the precepts of Jesus Christ, and all his followers;
for hitherto we have plainly demonstrated, that no such[185]
way of living, as is in request among you of the land, ever
was, or can be, truly Christian.

V. But the best recreation is to do good: and all
Christian customs tend to temperance, and some good and
beneficial end; which more or less may be in every action.
(1 Pet. i. 15; Heb. x. 25; 1 Pet. iv. 9-11; Matt. xxv.
36, 37; Phil. ii. 4; Ibid. iv. 8.) For instance, if men and
women would be diligent to follow their respective callings;
frequent the assemblies of religious people; visit
sober neighbours to be edified, and wicked ones to reform
them; be careful in the tuition of their children, exemplary
to their servants; relieve the necessitous, see the
sick, visit the imprisoned; administer to their infirmities
and indispositions, endeavour peace amongst neighbours:
also, study moderately such commendable and profitable
arts, as navigation, arithmetic, geometry, husbandry, gardening,
handicraft, medicine, &amp;c.; and that women spin,
sew, knit, weave, garden, preserve, and the like housewife
and honest employments, the practice of the greatest and
noblest matrons, and youth, among the very heathens;
helping others, who for want are unable to keep servants,
to ease them in their necessary affairs; often and private
retirements from all worldly objects, to enjoy the Lord:
secret and steady meditations on the divine life and heavenly
inheritance; which to leave undone and prosecute
other things, under the notion of recreations, is impiety;
it is most vain in any to object, that they cannot do these
always, and therefore why may not they use these common
diversions? for I ask, what would such be at? what
would they do? and what would they have? They that have
trades have not time enough to do the half of what hath
been recommended. And as for those who have nothing
to do, and indeed do nothing, which is worse, but sin,
which is worst of all, here is variety of pleasant, of profitable,
yea, of very honourable employments and diversions[186]
for them. Such can with great delight sit at a play,
a ball, a masque, at cards, dice, &amp;c. drinking, revelling,
feasting, and the like, an entire day; yea turn night into
day, and invert the very order of the creation, to humour
their lusts; (Amos, vi. 3-8;) and were it not for eating
and sleeping, it would be past a doubt, whether they
would ever find time to cease from those vain and sinful
pastimes, till the hasty calls of death should summon
their appearance in another world: yet do they think it
intolerable, and hardly possible, for any to sit so long at a
profitable or religious exercise.

VI. But how do these think to pass their vast eternity
away? "For as the tree falls, so it lies." (Eccl. xi. 3.)
Let none deceive themselves, nor mock their immortal
souls with a pleasant, but most false and pernicious dream,
that they shall be changed by a constraining and irresistible
power, just when their souls take leave of their
bodies; no, no, my friends, "what you sow, that shall you
reap:" (Gal. vi. 4-9; Eph. v. 6:) if vanity, folly, visible
delights, fading pleasures; no better shall you ever reap
than corruption, sorrow and the woful anguish of eternal
disappointments. But alas! what is the reason that the
cry is so common, Must we always dote on these things?
Why most certainly it is this, they know not what is the
joy and peace of speaking and acting, as in the presence
of the most holy God: (Eph. iv. 18-20:) that passes
such vain understandings, darkened with the glories and
pleasures of the god of this world; (Rom. x. 2;) whose
religion is so many mumbling and ignorantly devout said
words, as they teach parrots; for if they were of those
whose hearts are set on things above, and whose treasure
is in heaven, there would their minds inhabit, and their
greatest pleasure constantly be: and such who call that a
burden, and seek to be refreshed by such pastimes as a
play, a morrice-dance, a punchinello, a ball, a masque,[187]
cards, dice, or the like, I am bold to affirm, they not only
never knew the divine excellency of God, and his truth,
but thereby declare themselves most unfit for them in
another world. For how is it possible, that they can be
delighted to eternity with that satisfaction, which is so
tedious and irksome for thirty or forty years, that, for a
supply of recreation to their minds, the little toys and
fopperies of this perishing world must be brought into
practice and request? Surely, those who are to reckon
for every idle word, (Matt. xii. 36,) must not use sports
to pass away that time which they are commanded so diligently
to redeem, considering no less work is to be done,
than making their calling and election sure: (Eph. v. 16;
Phil. iii. 14; 2 Pet. i. 10; Col. iv. 5:) much less study
to invent recreations for their vain minds, and spend the
greatest part of their days, and months, and years therein,
not allowing a quarter of that time toward the great concernment
of their lives and souls, for which that time
was given them.

VII. There is but little need to drive away that, by
foolish divertisements, which flies away so swiftly of
itself; and when once gone, is never to be recalled. Plays,
parks, balls, treats, romances, music, love-sonnets, and the
like, will be a very invalid plea, for any other purpose
than their condemnation who are taken and delighted
with them, at the revelation of the righteous judgment of
God. O my friends! these were never invented, but by
that mind which had first lost the joy and ravishing
delights of God's holy presence. So that we conclude
first that of those many excellent employments already
mentioned, as worthy to possess such minds as are inclined
to these vanities, there is store enough of time, not only
to take up their spare hours, but double so much, and
that with great delight, diversion, and profit, both to
themselves and others; were they but once weaned from[188]
vain and fruitless fopperies, and did they but consider,
how great the satisfaction, and how certain the rewards
are, which attend this, and the other life, for such universal
benefits and virtuous examples. The second conclusion
is, that what is alleged by me, can be displeasing and
ungrateful to none, but such as know not what it is to
walk with God, to prepare for an eternal mansion, to have
the mind exercised on heavenly and good things, to follow
the examples of the holy men and women of former
happy ages: such as know not Christ's doctrine, life,
death, and resurrection, but only have their minds fastened
to the flesh, and by the objects of it are allured, deceived, and
miserably ruined: and lastly, that despise heaven, and the
joys that are not seen, though eternal, for a few perishing
trifles that they do see; though they are decreed to pass
away. (Rom. vi. 3-8; 1 Cor. xii. 13; Gal. iii. 27; Col.
ii. 12, 13; Eph. iv. 13.) How these are baptized with
Christ, into his holy life, cruel sufferings, shameful death,
and raised with him to immortal desires, heavenly meditations,
a divine new life, growing into the knowledge of
heavenly mysteries, and all holiness, even unto the measure
of the stature of Jesus Christ, the great example of
all: how, I say, these resemble most necessary Christian
qualifications, and what share they have therein, let their
consciences tell them upon a serious inquiry in the cool of
the day.

VIII. But in the next place, such attire and pastimes
do not only show the exceeding worldliness of people's
inclinations, and their very great ignorance of the divine
joys; but by imitating these fashions, and frequenting
these places and diversions, not only much good is omitted,
but a certain door is open to much evil to be committed:
as first, precious time, that were worth a world on a dying
bed, is lost: money that might be employed for the
general good, vainly expended, pleasure is taken in mere[189]
shame; lusts are gratified, the minds of the people alienated
from heavenly things, and exercised about mere folly;
and men become acceptable by their trims and the à-la-modeness
of their dress and apparel; from whence respect
to persons doth so naturally arise, that to deny it is to
affirm the sun shines not at noon-day; (James, ii. 1-9;)
nothing being more notorious than the cringing, scraping,
sirring, and madaming of persons, according to the gaudiness
of their attire: which is detestable to God, and so
absolutely forbidden in the Scriptures, that to do it is to
break the whole law, and consequently to incur the punishment
thereof. Next, what great holes do the like practices
make in men's estates! How are their vocations
neglected, young women deluded, the marriage-bed invaded,
contentions and family animosities begotten, partings
of man and wife, disinheriting of children, dismissing
of servants! On the other hand, servants made slaves,
children disregarded, wives despised and shamefully
abused, through the intemperance of their husbands;
which either puts them upon the same extravagance, or
laying such cruel injustice to heart, they pine away their
days in grief and misery. But of all these wretched inventions,
the playhouses, like so many hellish seminaries,
do most perniciously conduce to these sad and miserable
ends; where little besides frothy, wanton, if not directly
obscene and profane humours are represented, which are
of notoriously ill consequence upon the minds of most;
especially the youth that frequent them. And thus it is
that idle and debauched stages are encouraged and maintained;
than which scarcely a greater abomination can be
thought on of that rank of impieties, as will anon particularly
be shown; and truly nothing but the excessive
pleasure people take therein could blind their eyes from
seeing it.

IX. But lastly, the grand indisposition of mind in[190]
people to solid, serious, and heavenly meditations, by the
almost continual, as well as pleasant rumination in their
minds, of those various adventures they have been entertained
with, which in the more youthful can never miss to
inflame and animate their boiling and airy constitutions.
(Job, xxxv. 13.) And in the rest of the common recreations
of balls, masques, treats, cards, dice, &amp;c. there are
the like opportunities to promote the like evils. And yet
further; how many quarrels, animosities, nay, murders
too, as well as expense of estate and precious time, have
been the immediate consequences of the like practices!
In short, these were the ways of the Gentiles that knew
not God, but never the practice of them that feared Him:
(Eph. iv. 17-25:) nay, the more noble among the heathens
themselves, namely, Anaxagoras, Socrates, Plato,
Antisthenes, Heraclitus, Zeno, Aristides, Cato, Tully,
Epictetus, Seneca, &amp;c. have left their disgust to these
things upon record, as odious and destructive, not only of
the honour of the immortal God, but of all good order and
government; as leading into looseness, idleness, ignorance,
and effeminacy, the great cankers and bane of all states
and empires. And the pretended innocency of these
things steals away their minds from that which is better,
into the love of them; nay, it gives them confidence to
plead for them, and by no means will they think the contrary.
But why? because it is a liberty that feeds the
flesh and gratifies the lustful eye and palate of poor mortality:
wherefore they think it a laudable condition to be
no better than the beast, that eats and drinks but what his
nature doth require; although the number is very small of
such, so very exorbitant are men and women grown in this
present age: for either they do believe their actions are to
be ruled by their own will; or else at best, that not to be
stained with the vilest wickedness is matter of great
boasting: and indeed it is so in a time when nothing is[191]
too wicked to be done. But certainly, it is a sign of universal
impiety in a land, when not to be guilty of the sins
the very heathens loathe, is to be virtuous, yes, and Christian
too, and that to no small degree of reputation: a dismal
symptom to a country! But is it not to be greatly
blinded, that those we call infidels should detest those
practices as infamous which people that call themselves
Christians, cannot or will not see to be such, but gild them
over with the fair titles of ornaments, decency, recreation,
and the like? Well, my friends, if there were no God, no
heaven, no hell, no holy examples, no Jesus Christ, in
cross, doctrine, and life, to be conformed unto; yet would
charity to the poor, help to the needy, peace amongst
neighbours, visits to the sick, care of the widow and
fatherless, with the rest of those temporal good offices
already repeated, be a nobler employment, and much more
worthy of your expense and pains. Nor indeed is it to be
conceived, that the way to glory is smoothed with such a
variety of carnal pleasures; for then conviction, a wounded
spirit, a broken heart, a regenerate mind; (Prov. xviii. 14;
Psalm li. 17; Matt. v. 4; Luke, vi. 25; Rom. ii. 7; Psalm
xl. 8; Rom. vii. 22; Heb. xi. 13-16; Rom. i. 25-30;)
in a word, immortality, would prove as mere fictions as
some make them, and others therefore think them: no,
these practices are for ever to be extinguished and expelled
all Christian society. For I affirm, that to one who internally
knows God, and hath a sense of his blessed presence,
all such recreations are death; yea, more dangerously evil,
and more apt to steal away the mind from the heavenly
exercise, than grosser impieties. For they are so big they
are plainly seen; so dirty, they are easily detected: which
education and common temperance, as well as constitution
in many, teach them to abhor: and if they should be committed,
they carry with them a proportionable conviction.
But these pretended innocents, these supposed harmless[192]
satisfactions, (Job, i. 4,) are more surprising, more destructive:
for as they easily gain an admission by the senses,
so the more they pretend to innocency the more they
secure the minds of people in the common use of their
evil consequences, that with a mighty confidence they
can plead for them.

X. But as this is plainly not to deny themselves,
(1 John, ii. 15-17,) but on the contrary, to employ the
vain inventions of carnal men and women, to gratify the
desire of the eye, the desire of the flesh, and the pride of
life, (all which exercise the mind below the divine and
only true pleasure, or else, tell me what does,) so be it
known to be such, that the heavenly life and Christian
joys are of another kind, as hath already been expressed:
yea, that the true disciples of the Lord Christ must be
hereunto crucified, as to objects and employments that
attract downwards, and that their affections should be
raised to a more sublime and spiritual conversation, as to
use this world, even in its most innocent enjoyments, as if
they used it not. But if they take pleasure in anything
below, it should be in such good offices as before mentioned,
whereby a benefit may redound in some respect to
others: in which God is honoured over all visible things,
the nation relieved, the government bettered, themselves
rendered exemplary of good, and thereby justly entitled to
present happiness, a sweet memorial with posterity, as
well as to a seat at his right hand, where there are joys
and pleasures for ever: (Job, xxxvi. 7; Psalm v. 12;
Prov. x. 7, 11:) than which there can be nothing more
honourable, nothing more certain, world without end.



[193]




CHAPTER XVI.



1. Luxury should not be used by Christians, because of its inconsistency
with the spirit of Christianity.&mdash;2. The cup of which
Christ's true disciples drank.&mdash;3. O! who will drink of this cup!&mdash;4.
An objection answered of the nature of God's kingdom, and
what it stands in.&mdash;5. Of the frame of the spirit of Christ's followers.


I. But the luxury opposed in this discourse should not be
allowed among Christians, because both that which invents
it, delights in it, and pleads so strongly for it, is inconsistent
with the true spirit of Christianity; nor doth
the very nature of the Christian religion admit thereof.
For therefore was it, that immortality and eternal life were
brought to light, that all the invented pleasures of mortal
life, in which the world lives, might be denied and relinquished:
and for this reason it is, that nothing less than
immense rewards and eternal mansions are promised, that
men and women might therefore be encouraged willingly
to forsake the vanity and fleshly satisfactions of the world,
and encounter with boldness the shame and sufferings they
must expect to receive at the hand of, it may be, their
nearest intimates and relations.

For if the Christian religion had admitted the possession
of this world in any other sense than the simple and
naked use of those creatures, really given of God for the
necessity and convenience of the whole creation; for
instance, did it allow all that pride, vanity, curiosity,
pomp, exchange of apparel, honours, preferments, fashions,[194]
and the customary recreations of the world, with whatever
may delight and gratify their senses; then what need of a
daily cross; a self-denying life; working out salvation
with fear and trembling; seeking the things that are
above; having the treasure and heart in heaven; no idle
talking, no vain jesting, but fearing and meditating all the
day long; undergoing all reproach, scorn, hard usage,
bitter mockings, and cruel deaths? What need these
things? And why should they be expected in order to
that glorious immortality and eternal crown, if the vanity,
pride, expense, idleness, concupiscence, envy, malice, and
whole manner of living among the called Christians, were
allowed by the Christian religion? No certainly; but as
the Lord Jesus Christ well knew in what foolish trifles
and vain pleasures, as well as grosser impieties, the minds
of men and women were fixed, and how much they were
degenerated from the heavenly principle of life, into a
lustful or unlawful seeking after the enjoyments of this
perishing world, nay, inventing daily new satisfactions to
gratify the carnal appetites, so did He not less foresee the
difficulty that all would have to relinquish and forsake
them at his call, and with what great unwillingness they
would take their leave of them, and be weaned from them.
Wherefore to induce them to it, He did not speak unto
them in the language of the law, that they should have an
earthly Canaan, great dignities, a numerous issue, a long
life, and the like: no, rather the contrary, at least to take
these things in their course; but He speaks to them in a
higher strain; namely, He assures them of a kingdom and
a crown that are immortal, that neither time, cruelty,
death, grave, or hell, with all its instruments, shall ever be
able to disappoint or take away from those who should
believe and obey Him. Further, that they should be taken
into that near alliance of loving friends, yea, the intimate
divine relation of dear brethren, and co-heirs with Him of[195]
all celestial happiness, and a glorious immortality. Wherefore,
if it be recorded that those who heard not Moses
were to die, much more they who refuse to hear and obey
the precepts of this great and eternal Rewarder of all that
diligently seek and follow Him.

II. And therefore it was that He was pleased to give us,
in his own example, a taste of what his disciples must
expect to drink deeply of, namely, the cup of self-denial,
cruel trials, and most bitter afflictions: He came not to
consecrate a way to the eternal rest, through gold, and
silver, ribbons, laces, prints, perfumes, costly clothes,
curious trims, exact dresses, rich jewels, pleasant recreations,
plays, treats, balls, masques, revels, romances, love-songs,
and the like pastimes of the world: no, no, alas!
but by forsaking all such kind of entertainments, yea, and
sometimes more lawful enjoyments too; and cheerfully
undergoing the loss of all on the one hand, and the
reproach, ignominy, and the most cruel persecution from
ungodly men on the other. He needed never to have
wanted such variety of worldly pleasures, had they been
suitable to the nature of his kingdom: for He was tempted,
as are his followers, with no less bait than all the glories
of the world: but He commanded to seek another country,
and to lay up treasures in the heavens that fade not away;
and therefore charged them never to be much inquisitive
about what they should eat, drink, or put on, "because,"
saith He, "after these things the Gentiles," that know not
God, "do seek;" (Matt. vi. 29-33;) (and Christians that
pretend to know Him too,) but "having food and raiment,
therewith to be content:" (1 Tim. vi. 11:) He, I say, that
enjoined this doctrine, and led that holy and heavenly
example, even the Lord Jesus Christ, bade them that
would be his disciples take up the same cross, and follow
Him (Luke, xiv. 26, 27, 33.)

III. O who will follow Him! Who will be true Christians?[196]
We must not think to steer another course, nor to
drink of another cup, than hath the Captain of our salvation
done before us: (Heb. ii. 10:) no, for it is the very
question He asked James and John, the sons of Zebedee
of old, when they desired to sit at his right and left hand
in his kingdom, "Are ye able to drink of the cup that I
shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I
am baptized with?" (Matt. xx. 22.) Otherwise no disciples,
no Christians. Whoever they are that would come
to Christ, and be right Christians, must readily abandon
every delight that would steal away the affections of the
mind, and exercise it from the divine principle of life, and
freely write a bill of divorce for every beloved vanity; and
all, under the Sun of Righteousness is so, compared with
Him.

Objection 1. IV. But some are ready to object, who
will not seem to want Scripture for their lusts, although it
be evidently misapplied. The kingdom of God stands not
in meats, or in drinks, or in apparel, &amp;c. Answer. Right;
therefore it is that we stand out of them. But surely you
have the least reason of any to object this to us, who
make those things so necessary to conversation, as our not
conforming to them renders us obnoxious to your reproach;
which how Christian, or resembling it is of the righteousness,
peace, and joy in which the heavenly kingdom stands,
let the just principle in your own consciences determine.
Our conversation stands in temperance, and that stands in
righteousness, by which we have obtained that kingdom,
your latitude and excess have no share or interest in. If
none, therefore, can be true disciples but they that come
to bear the daily cross, but those who follow the example
of the Lord Jesus Christ, (Phil. iii. 10; 1 Pet. iv. 13;
Tit. ii. 11-13; John, i. 9; Rom. vi. 6; Gal. ii. 20;
v. 24; vi. 4,) through his baptism, afflictions, and temptations;
and that none are so baptized with Him but those[197]
whose minds are retired from the vanities in which the
generality of the world live, and become obedient to the
holy light and divine grace with which they have been
enlightened from on high, and thereby are daily exercised
to the crucifying of every contrary affection, and bringing
of immortality to light; if none are true disciples but such,
as most undoubtedly they are not, then let the people of
these days a little soberly reflect upon themselves, and
they will conclude that none who live and delight in these
vain customs and this un-christ-like conversation can be
true Christians, or disciples of the crucified JESUS: for
otherwise, how would it be a cross; or the Christian life
matter of difficulty and reproach? No, the offence of the
cross would soon cease, which is "the power of God to
them that believe;" (Gal. v. 11; 1 Cor. i. 18;) that every
lust and vanity may be subdued, and the creature brought
into a holy subjection of mind to the heavenly will of its
Creator. For therefore has it been said, that Jesus Christ
was and is manifested, that by his holy self-denying life
and doctrine, and by the immortality He brought, and
daily brings to light, He might stain the glory of their
fading rests and pleasures; (1 Cor. i. 27-29;) that having
their minds weaned from them, and being crucified thereunto,
they might seek another country, and obtain an everlasting
inheritance: for "the things that are seen are temporal,"
(2 Cor. iv. 18,) and those they were, and all true
Christians are, to be redeemed from resting in: but the
things that are not seen are eternal; those they were, and
all are to be brought to, and have their affections chiefly
fixed upon.

V. Wherefore a true disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ
is to have his mind so conversant about heavenly things,
that the things of this world may be used as if they were
not: that having such things as are necessary and convenient,
he be therewith content, without the superfluity of[198]
the world; (1 Tim. vi. 8;) whereby the pleasure that in
times of ignorance was taken in the customs and fashions
of the world, may more abundantly be supplied in the
hidden and heavenly life of Jesus: for unless there be an
abiding in Christ, it will be impossible to bring forth that
much fruit (John, xv. 4, 7, 8,) which He requires at the
hand of his followers, and wherein his Father is glorified.
But as it is clear that such as live in the vanities, pleasures,
recreations, and lusts of the world, abide not in Him,
neither know Him, for they that know Him depart from
iniquity; so is their abiding and delighting in those bewitching
follies, the very reason why they are so ignorant
and insensible of Him: Him who continually stands knocking
at the door of their hearts; (Rev. iii. 20;) in whom
they ought to abide, and whose divine power they should
know to be the cross on which every beloved lust and
alluring vanity should be slain and crucified; that so they
might feel the heavenly life to spring up in their hearts,
and themselves to be quickened to seek the things that
are above; that when Christ shall appear, they might
appear with Him in glory who is over all, God blessed for
ever. (Col. iii. 1; Rom. ix. 5.) Amen.



[199]




CHAPTER XVII.



1. The customs, fashions, &amp;c. which make up the attire and pleasure
of the age, are enemies to inward retirement.&mdash;2. Their end
is to gratify lust.&mdash;3. Had they been solid, Adam and Eve had
not been happy, that never had them.&mdash;4. But the confidence
and presumption of Christians, as they would be called, in the
use of them is abominable.&mdash;5. Their authors further condemn
them, who are usually loose and vain people.&mdash;6. Mostly borrowed
of the Gentiles, that knew not God.&mdash;7. An objection of
their usefulness considered and answered, and the objectors
reproved.&mdash;8. The best heathens abhorring what pretended
Christians plead for.&mdash;9. The use of these things encourages the
authors and makers of them to continue in them.&mdash;10. The objection
of the maintenance of families answered. None must do
evil, that good should follow: but better employments may be
found more serviceable to the world.&mdash;11. Another objection
answered: GOD no author of their inventions, and so not
excusable by his institution.&mdash;12. People pleading for these
vanities show what they are. An exhortation to the weighty
and considerate. A great part of the way to true discipleship, is
to abandon the school and shop of Satan.


I. Next, those customs and fashions, which make up the
common attire and conversation of the times, do eminently
obstruct the inward retirement of people's minds, by which
they may come to behold the glories of immortality: who
instead of fearing their Creator in the days of their youth,
and seeking the kingdom of God in the first place, (Eccl.
xii. 1; Luke, xii. 31,) expecting the addition of such
other things as may be necessary and convenient, according
to the injunctions of God and the Lord Jesus Christ;
as soon as they can do anything, they look after pride,[200]
vanity, and that conversation which is most delightful to
the flesh, (Jer. xviii. 18-20,) which becomes their most
delightful entertainment: all which do but evidently beget
lustful conceptions, and inflame to inordinate thoughts,
wanton discourses, lascivious treats, if not at last to wicked
actions. To such it is tedious and offensive to speak of
heaven or another life. Bid them reflect upon their
actions, not grieve the Holy Spirit, consider of an eternal
doom, prepare for judgment; and the best return that is
usual is reproachful jests, (Eph. v. 3, 4,) profane repartees,
if not direct blows. Their thoughts are otherwise employed:
their mornings are too short for them to wash, to
smooth, to paint, to patch, to braid, to curl, to gum, to
powder, and otherwise to attire and adorn themselves;
(Psalm xii. 2; Isa. v.; xii.; lix. 3, 4;) whilst their afternoons
are as commonly bespoke for visits and for plays;
where their usual entertainment is some stories fetched
from the more approved romances; some strange adventures,
some passionate amours, unkind refusals, grand impediments,
importunate addresses, miserable disappointments,
wonderful surprises, unexpected encounters, castles
surprised, imprisoned lovers rescued, and meetings of supposed
dead ones; bloody duels, languishing voices echoing
from solitary groves, overheard mournful complaints,
deep-fetched sighs sent from wild deserts, intrigues
managed with unheard-of subtlety; and whilst all things
seem at the greatest distance, then are dead people alive,
enemies friends, despair turned to enjoyment, and all their
impossibilities reconciled: things that never were, nor are,
nor ever shall or can be, they all come to pass. And as if
men and women were too slow to answer the loose suggestions
of corrupt nature; or were too intent on more
divine speculations and heavenly affairs, they have all that
is possible for the most extravagant wits to invent; not
only express lies, but utter impossibilities to very nature,[201]
on purpose to excite their minds to those idle passions,
and intoxicate their giddy fancies with swelling nothings
but airy fictions: which not only consume their time,
effeminate their natures, debase their reason, and set them
on work to reduce these things to practice, and make each
adventure theirs by imitation; but if disappointed,&mdash;as who
can otherwise expect from such mere phantasms?&mdash;the present
remedy is latitude in the greatest vice. And yet these
are some of their most innocent recreations, which are the
very gins of Satan, to ensnare people; contrived most
agreeable to their weakness, and in a more insensible
manner mastering their affections by entertainments most
taking to their senses. On such occasions it is their
hearts breed vanity, and their eyes turn interpreters to
their thoughts, and their looks do whisper the secret
inflammations of their intemperate minds; (Prov. vii.
10-21;) wandering so long abroad, till their lascivious
actings bring night home, and load their minds and reputations
with lust and infamy.

II. Here is the end of all their fashions and recreations,
to gratify the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the
pride of life: (1 John, ii. 15, 16:) clothes that were given
to cover, now want a covering for their shameful excess; and
that which should remind men of lost innocency, they
pride and glory in: but the hundredth part of these things
cost man the loss of Paradise, that now make up the
agreeable recreation, aye, the accomplishment of the
times. For as it was Adam's fault to seek a satisfaction to
himself, other than what God ordained; so it is the
exercise, pleasure, and perfection of the age, to spend the
greatest portion of their time in vanities, which are so far
from the end of their creation, namely, a divine life, that
they are destructive of it.

III. Were the pleasures of the age true and solid,
Adam and Eve had been miserable in their innocency,[202]
who knew them not: but as it was once their happiness,
not to know them in any degree; so it is theirs, that know
Christ indeed, to be by his eternal power redeemed and
raised to the love of immortality: which is yet a mystery
to those who live and have pleasure in their curious trims,
rich and changeable apparel, nicety of dress, invention
and imitation of fashions, costly attire, mincing gaits,
wanton looks, romances, plays, treats, balls, feasts, and
the like conversation in request: for as these had never
been, if man had staid at home with his Creator, and
given the entire exercise of his mind to the noble ends of
his creation; so certain it is, that the use of these vanities,
is not only a sign that men and women are yet ignorant of
their true rest and pleasure, but it greatly obstructs and
hinders the retirement of their minds, and their serious
inquiry after those things that are eternal. O that there
should be so much noise, clutter, invention, traffic, curiosity,
diligence, pains, and vast expense of time and estate,
to please and gratify poor vain mortality! And that the
soul, the very image of divinity itself, should have so little
of their consideration. What, O what more pregnant
instances and evident tokens can be given, that it is the
body, the senses, the case, a little flesh and bone covered
with skin, the toys, fopperies, and very vanities of this
mortal life and perishing world, that please, that take,
that gain them; on which they dote; and think they
never have too much time, love, or money to bestow upon
them!

IV. Thus are their minds employed; and so vain are
they in their imaginations, and dark in their understandings,
that they not only believe them innocent, but
persuade themselves they are good Christians all this
while; and to rebuke them is worse than heresy. (Luke,
viii. 14; Prov. i. 30, x. 17, xii. 1, xv. 14; Isa. lvii. 1-10;
Jer. xvi. 19-21; Mat. vi. 7.) Thus are they strangers[203]
to the hidden life; and by these things are they diverted
from all serious examination of themselves: and a forced
zeal of half-an-hour's talk in other men's words, which
they have nothing to do with, is made sufficient; being
no more their states, or at least their intention, as their
works show, than it was the young man's in the Gospel,
that said, he would go, and did not. But alas! why? O
there are other guests! What are they? Pharamond,
Cleopatra, Cassandra, Clelia; a play, a ball a spring-garden;
the park, the gallant, the exchange, in a word,
the world. These stay, these call, these are importunate,
and these they attend, and these are their most familiar
associates. Thus are their hearts captivated from the
divine exercise; nay, from such external affairs, as immediately
concern some benefit to themselves, or needy
neighbours; pleasing themselves with the received ideas
of those toys and fopperies into their loose and airy minds;
and if in all things they cannot practise them, because
they want the means of it, yet as much as may be, at least
to dote upon them, be taken with them, and willingly
suffer their thoughts to be hurried after them. All which
greatly indisposes the minds, and distracts the souls of
people from the divine life and principle of the holy Jesus;
but, as it hath been often said, more especially the minds
of the younger sort: to whom the like divertisements
(Jer. ii. 5,) (where their inclinations being presented with
what is very suitable to them, they become excited to
more vanity than ever they thought upon before,) are
incomparably dearer than all that can be said of God's
fear, a retired life, eternal rewards, and joys unspeakable
and full of glory: so vain, so blind, and so very insensible
are men and women, of what truly makes a disciple of
Christ. (Rom. xiii. 11, 12; Matt. xv. 7-14.) O! that
they would ponder on these things, and watch against,
and come out of all these vanities, for the coming of the[204]
Lord, lest being unprepared, and taken up with other
guests, they enter not into his everlasting rest.

V. That which further manifests the unlawfulness of
these numerous fashions and recreations is, that they are
either the inventions of vain, idle, and wanton minds, to
gratify their own sensualities, and raise the like wicked
curiosity in others, to imitate the same; by which nothing
but lust and folly are promoted: or the contrivances of
indigent and impoverished wits, who make it the next
way for their maintenance: in both which respects, and
upon both which considerations, they ought to be detested.
For the first licenses express impiety, and the latter
countenances a wretched way of livelihood, and consequently
diverts from more lawful, more serviceable, and
more necessary employments. That such persons are
both the inventors and actors of all these follies, cannot be
difficult to demonstrate: for were it possible, that any one
could bring us father Adam's girdle, and mother Eve's
apron, what laughing, what fleering, what mocking of
their homely fashions would there be! Surely their tailor
would find but little custom, although we read, it was
God himself that made them coats of skins. (Gen. iii.
21.) The like may be asked of all the other vanities,
concerning the holy men and women through all the
generations of holy writ. How many pieces of ribbon,
and what feathers, lace-bands, and the like, did Adam and
Eve wear in Paradise, or out of it? What rich embroideries,
silks, points, &amp;c. had Abel, Enoch, Noah, and good old
Abraham? Did Eve, Sarah, Susannah, Elizabeth, and the
Virgin Mary use to curl, powder, patch, paint, wear false
locks, or strange colours, rich points, trimmings, laced
gowns, embroidered petticoats, shoes with slip-slaps, laced
with silver or silver lace, and ruffled like pigeons' feet,
with several yards, if not pieces of ribbons? How many
plays did Jesus Christ and his apostles recreate themselves[205]
at? What poets, romances, comedies, and the like did
the apostles and saints make, or use to pass away their
time withal? I know, they bid all redeem their time, to
avoid foolish talking, vain jesting, profane babblings, and
fabulous stories; (Eph. v. 1-5, 15, 16; 2 Tim. ii. 16, 22;
Matt. xxv. 13; Phil. ii. 12, 13; Col. iii. 1, 2, 5;) as what
tend to godliness: and rather to watch, to work out their
salvation with fear and trembling, to flee foolish and
youthful lusts, and to follow righteousness, peace, goodness,
love, charity; and to mind the things that are above
as they would have honour, glory, immortality, and eternal
life.

VI. But if I were asked, Whence came they then? I
could quickly answer, From the Gentiles, that knew not
God; for some amongst them detested them, as will be
shown; they were the pleasures of an effeminate Sardanapalus,
a fantastic Miracles, a comical Aristophanes, a
prodigal Charaxus, a luxurious Aristippus; and the
practices of such women as the infamous Clytemnestra,
the painted Jezebel, the lascivious Campaspe, the immodest
Posthumia, the costly Corinthian Lais, the most
impudent Flora, the wanton Egyptian Cleopatra, and most
insatiable Messalina: persons whose memories have
stunk through all ages, and that carry with them a perpetual
rot: these, and not the holy self-denying men
and women in ancient times, were devoted to the like
recreations and vain delights. Nay, the more sober of
the very heathens themselves, and that upon a principle of
great virtue, as is by all confessed, detested the like folly
and wanton practices. There is none of them to be found
in Plato, or in Seneca's works: Pythagoras, Socrates,
Phocion, Zeno, &amp;c. did not accustom themselves to these
entertainments. The virtuous Penelope, the chaste Lucretia,
and the grave Cornelia, with many others, could
find themselves employment enough among their children,[206]
servants, and neighbours; they, though nobles, next to
their devotion, delighted most in spinning, weaving,
gardening, needlework, and such like good housewifery,
and commendable entertainment: who, though called
Heathens, expressed much more Christianity in all their
actions, than do the wanton, foolish people of this age,
who notwithstanding will be called Christians. But above
all, you playmongers, whence think you, came your so
passionately beloved comedies; than which, as there is
not any one diversion that is more pernicious, so not one
more in esteem, and fondly frequented? Why, I will
tell you; their greatgrandfather was a Heathen, and
that not of the best sort: his name was Epicharmus. It is
true, he is called a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom;
but he was only so by name; and no more in reality than
the comedians of these times are true Christians. It is
reported of him by Suidas, a Greek historian, that he
was the first man who invented comedies; and by the
help of one Phormus, he made also fifty fables. But would
you know his country, and the reason of his invention?
His country was Syracuse, the chief city in Sicily, famous
for the infamy of many tyrants; to please and gratify the
lusts of some of whom, he set his wits to work. And do
not you think this an ill original? And is it less in any
one to imitate, or justify the same, since the more sober
Heathens have themselves condemned them? Nay, is it
not abominable, when such as call themselves Christians,
do both imitate and justify the like inventions? Nor had
the melancholy tragedies a better parentage, namely, one
Thespis, an Athenian poet; to whom they also do ascribe
the original of that impudent custom of painting faces,
and the counterfeit, or representation of other persons, by
change of habit, humours, &amp;c., all which are now so much
in use and reputation with the great ones of the times. To
these let me add that poetical amoroso, whom an inordinate[207]
passion of love first transported to those poetical raptures
of admiration, indeed sordid effeminacy, if not idolatry;
they call him Alcman or Alcina, a Lydian: he being
exceedingly in love with a young woman of his own country,
is said to have been the first person that gave the
world a sight of that kind of folly, namely, love stories,
and verses; which have been so diligently imitated by
almost all nations ever since in their romances.

Objection 2. VII. I know that some will say, But we
have many comedies and tragedies, sonnets, catches, &amp;c.
that are on purpose to reprehend vice, from whence we
learn many commendable things. Though this be shameful,
yet many have been wont, for want of shame or understanding,
or both, to return me this for answer. Now I
readily shall confess, that amongst the heathens it was the
next remedy against the common vices to the more grave
and moral lectures of their philosophers, of which number
I shall instance two: Euripides, whom Suidas calls a
learned tragical poet, and Eupolis, whom the same historian
calls a comical poet. The first was a man so chaste,
and therefore so unlike those of our days, that he was
called one that hated women, that is, wanton ones, for
otherwise he was twice married; the other he characters
as a most severe reprehender of faults. From which I
gather, that their design was not to feed the idle lazy
fancies of people, nor merely to get money; but since by
the means of loose wits the people had been debauched,
their work was to reclaim them, rendering vice ridiculous,
and turning wit against wickedness. And this appears
the rather, from the description given, as also that Euripides
was supposed to have been torn in pieces by wanton
women; which doubtless was for declaiming against their
impudence: and the other being slain in the battle betwixt
the Athenians and Lacedæmonians, was so regretted, that
a law was made, that never after such poets should be[208]
allowed to bear arms: doubtless it was because in losing
him they lost a reprover of vice. So that the end of the
approved comedians and tragedians of those times was but
to reform the people by making sin odious: and that not
so much by a rational and argumentative way, usual with
their philosophers; as by sharp jeers, severe reflections,
and rendering their vicious actions shameful, ridiculous,
and detestable; so that for reputation sake they might not
longer be guilty of them: which is to me but a little softer
than a whip or a bridewell. Now if you that plead for
them will be contented to be accounted heathens, and
those of the more dissolute and wicked sort too, that will
sooner be jeered than argued out of your sins, we shall
acknowledge to you that such comedies and tragedies as
these may be serviceable; but then for shame abuse not
the name of Jesus Christ so impudently as to call yourselves
Christians, whose lusts are so strong, that you are
forced to use the low shifts of heathens to repel them: to
leave their evils not for the love of virtue, but out of fear,
shame, or reputation. Is this your love to Jesus, your
reverence to the Scriptures, that through faith are able to
make the man of God perfect? Is all your prattle about
ordinances, prayers, sacraments, Christianity, and the like,
come to this; that at last you must betake yourselves to
such instructors as were by the sober heathens permitted
to reclaim the most vicious of the people that were
amongst them? And such remedies too as below which
there is nothing but corporal punishment?

VIII. This is so far from Christianity, that many of the
nobler heathens, men and women, were better taught, and
better disposed; they found out more heavenly contemplations,
and subjects of an eternal nature to meditate
upon. Nay, so far did they outstrip the Christians of
these times, that they not only were exemplary by their
grave and sober conversation; but for their public benefit[209]
the Athenians instituted the Gynæcosmi, or twenty men,
who should make it their business to observe the people's
apparel and behaviour; that if any were found immodest,
and to demean themselves loosely, they had full authority
to punish them. But the case is altered; it is punishable
to reprove such: yes, it is matter of the greatest contumely
and reproach. Nay, so impudent are some grown
in their impieties, that they sport themselves with such
religious persons: and not only manifest a great neglect
of piety, and a severe life by their own looseness, but their
extreme contempt of it, by rendering it ridiculous, through
comical and abusive jests on public stages. Which, how
dangerous it is, and apt to make religion little worth in
the people's eyes, besides the demonstration of this age,
let us remember that Aristophanes had not a readier way
to bring the reputation of Socrates in question with the
people, who greatly reverenced him for his grave and
virtuous life and doctrine, than by his abusive representations
of him in a play: which made the airy, wanton,
unstable crowd, rather part with Socrates in earnest, than
Socrates in jest. Nor can a better reason be given why
the poor Quakers are made so much the scorn of men,
than because of their severe reprehensions of sin and
vanity, and their self-denying conversation, amidst so great
intemperance in all worldly satisfactions: yet can such
libertines all this while strut and swell for Christians, and
strut it out against precept and example; but we must be
whimsical, conceited, morose, melancholy, or else heretics,
deceivers, and what not? O blindness! Pharisaical
hypocrisy! As if such were fit to be judges of religion;
or that it were possible for them to have a sight and sense
of true religion, or really to be religious, whilst darkened
in their understandings by the god of the pleasures of this
world; and their minds so wrapped up in external enjoyments,
and the variety of worldly delight: no, in the name[210]
of the everlasting God, you mock Him, and deceive your
souls; for the wrath of the Almighty is against you all,
whilst in that spirit and condition; in vain are all your
babbles and set performances, God laughs you to scorn;
his anger is kindling because of these things: wherefore
be ye warned to temperance, and repent.

IX. Besides, this sort of people are not only wicked,
loose, and vain, who both invent and act these things;
but by your great delight in such vain inventions you
encourage them therein, and hinder them from more
honest and more serviceable employments. For what is
the reason that most commodities are held at such excessive
rates, but because labour is so very dear? And why
is it so, but because so many hands are otherwise bestowed,
even about the very vanity of all vanities? Nay, how
common is it with these mercenary procurers to people's
folly, that when their purses begin to grow low, they shall
present them with a new and pretendedly more convenient
fashion; and that perhaps before the former costly habits
shall have done half their service; which either must be
given away, or new vamped in the cut most à-la-mode. O
prodigal, yet frequent folly!

Objection 3. X. I know I am coming to encounter the
most plausible objection they are used to urge when
driven to a pinch, viz. But how shall those many families
subsist whose livelihood depends upon such fashions and
recreations as you so earnestly decry? I answer: it is a
bad argument to plead for the commission of the least
evil that never so great a good may come of it: if you and
they have made wickedness your pleasure and your profit,
be ye content that it should be your grief and punishment
till the one can learn to be without such vanity, and the
others have found out more honest employments. It is
the vanity of the few great ones that makes so much toil
for the many small: and the great excess of the one occasions[211]
the great labour of the other. Would men learn to
be contented with few things, such as are necessary and
convenient, (the ancient Christian life,) all things might
be at a cheaper rate, and men might live for little. If the
landlords had less lusts to satisfy, the tenants might have
less rent to pay, and turn from poor to rich, whereby they
might be able to find more honest and domestic employments
for their children than becoming sharpers and living
by their wits, which is but a better word for their sins.
And if the report of the more intelligent in husbandry be
credible, lands are generally improvable ten in twenty:
and were there more hands about more lawful and serviceable
manufactures, they would be cheaper, and greater
vent might be made of them, by which a benefit would
redound to the world in general; nay, the burden lies the
heavier upon the laborious country, that so many hands
and shoulders as have the lust-caterers of the cities, should
be wanting to the plough and useful husbandry. If men
never think themselves rich enough, they may never miss
of trouble and employment; but those who can take the
primitive state and God's creation for their model, may
learn with a little to be contented; as knowing that
desires after wealth do not only prevent or destroy true
faith, but when got increase snares and trouble. It is no
evil to repent of evil: but that cannot be, whilst men
maintain what they should repent of: it is a bad argument
to avoid temperance, or justify the contrary, because otherwise
the actors and inventors of excess would want a livelihood;
since to feed them that way is to nurse the cause
instead of starving it. Let such of those vanity hucksters
as have got sufficient, be contented to retreat, and spend
it more honestly than they got it; and such as really are
poor, be rather helped by charity to better callings: this
were more prudent, nay Christian, than to consume money
upon such foolish toys and fopperies. Public workhouses[212]
would be effectual remedies to all these lazy and lustful
distempers, with more profit and a better conscience.
Therefore it is that we cannot, we dare not square our
conversation by the world's: no, but by our plainness and
moderation to testify against such extravagant vanities;
and by our grave and steady life to manifest our dislike,
on God's behalf, to such intemperate and wanton curiosity:
yea, to deny ourselves what otherwise perhaps we lawfully
could use with a just indifferency, if not satisfaction; because
of that abuse that is amongst the generality.

Objection 4. XI. I know, that some are ready further
to object: Hath God given us these enjoyments on purpose
to condemn us, if we use them? Answer: But to such
miserable, poor, silly souls, who would rather charge the
most high and holy God with the invention or creation of
their dirty vanities, than want a plea to justify their own
practice, not knowing how, for shame, or fear, or love to
throw them off; I answer, that what God made for man's
use, was good, and what the blessed Lord Jesus Christ
allowed or enjoined, or gave us in his most heavenly
example, is to be observed, believed, and practised. (Luke,
viii. 14; xii. 28-31.) But in the whole catalogue
the Scriptures give of both, I never found the attires,
recreations, and way of living, so much in request with
the generality of the Christians of these times: no certainly,
God created man a holy, wise, sober, grave, and
reasonable creature, fit to govern himself and the world:
but divinity was then the great object of his reason and
pleasure; all external enjoyments of God's giving being
for necessity, convenience, and lawful delight, with this
proviso too, that the Almighty was to be seen, and sensibly
enjoyed and reverenced in every one of them. But how
very wide the Christians of these times are from this
primitive institution is not difficult to determine, although
they make such loud pretensions to that most holy Jesus,[213]
who not only gave the world a certain evidence of a happy
restoration, by his own coming, but promised his assistance
to all that would follow Him in the self-denial and way of
his holy cross; (John, viii. 12; xv. 7, 8; xvii. 20;) and
therefore hath so severely enjoined no less on all, as they
would be everlastingly saved. But whether the minds of
men and women are not as profoundly involved in all
excess and vanity, as those who know Him not any further
than by hearsay; and whether being thus banished the
presence of the Lord, by their greedy seeking the things
that are below, and thereby having lost the taste of divine
pleasure, they have not feigned to themselves an imaginary
pleasure, to quiet or smother conscience, and pass their
time without that anguish and trouble which are the
consequences of sin, that so they might be at ease and
security while in the world, let their own consciences
declare. (Rom. ii. 8, 9.) Adam's temptation is represented
by the fruit of a tree, (Gen. iii. 6,) thereby intimating
the great influence external objects, as they exceed
in beauty, carry with them upon our senses: so that unless
the mind keep upon its constant watch, so prevalent are
visible things, that hard it is for one to escape being insnared
in them; (Mark, xiii. 33-37;) and he shall need
to be only sometimes entrapped, to cast so thick a veil of
darkness over the mind, that not only it shall with pleasure
continue in its fetters to lust and vanity, but proudly
censure such as refuse to wear them, strongly pleading for
them, as serviceable and convenient: that strange passion
do perishing objects raise in those minds where way is
made, and entertainment given to them. But Christ Jesus
is manifested in us, and hath given unto us a taste and
understanding of Him that is true; and to all such a proportion
of his good spirit, as is sufficient, would they
obey it, to redeem their minds from that captivity they
have been in to lust and vanity, and entirely ransom[214]
them from the dominion of all visible objects, and whatsoever
may gratify the desires of the eye, the lust of the
flesh, and the pride of life; (1 John, ii. 15, 16;) that they
might be regenerated in their minds, changed in their
affections, and have their whole hearts set on things that
are above, where moth nor rust can ever pass, or enter to
harm or destroy.

XII. But it is a manifest sign of what mould and make
the persons are who practise and plead for such shameful
Egyptian rags, as pleasures. It is to be hoped that they
never knew, or to be feared they have forgotten, the
humble, plain, meek, holy, self-denying, and exemplary
life, which the eternal Spirit sanctifies all obedient hearts
into; yea, it is indubitable that either such always have
been ignorant, or else they have lost sight of that good
land, that heavenly country, and blessed inheritance they
once had some glimmering prospect of. (Gal. v. 22-25;
Eph. v. 8-11, 15, 16.) O that they would but withdraw
a while, sit down, weigh and consider with themselves
where they are, and whose work and will they are doing!
that they would once believe the devil hath not a stratagem
more pernicious to their immortal souls, than this
of exercising their minds in the foolish fashions and
wanton recreations of the times! Great and gross impieties
beget a detestation in the opinion of sober education and
reputation; and therefore since the devil rightly sees such
things have no success with many; it is his next, and
most fatal design, to find some other entertainments, that
carry less of infection in their looks, (though more of
security, because less of scandal,) and more of pleasure
in their enjoyment, on purpose to busy and arrest people
from a diligent search and inquiry after those matters
which necessarily concern their eternal peace: (Eph. vi.
12-19:) that being ignorant of the heavenly life, they
may not be induced to press after it; but being only[215]
formally religious, according to the traditions and precepts
of others, proceed to their common pleasures, and find no
check therefrom, their religion and conversation for the
most part agreeing well together, whereby an improvement
in the knowledge of God, going on from grace to grace,
growing to the measure of the stature of Jesus Christ
himself, is not known; but as it was in the beginning
at seven, so it is at seventy; nay, not so innocent, unless
by reason of the old saying, "Old men are twice children."
(Eph. i. 16-23; iv. 12, 13.)

O! the mystery of godliness, the heavenly life, the true
Christian, are another thing. Wherefore we conclude
that as the design of the devil, where he cannot involve
and draw into gross sin, is to busy, delight, and allure the
minds of men and women by more seeming innocent
entertainments, on purpose that he may more easily secure
them from minding their duty and progress, and obedience
to the only true God, which is eternal life; (John. xvii.
3;) and thereby take up their minds from heavenly and
eternal things; so those who would be delivered from
these snares should mind the holy, just, grave, and self-denying
teachings of God's grace and Spirit in themselves,
that they may reject, and for ever abandon the like vanity
and evil; (Tit. ii. 11-15;) and by a reformed conversation
condemn the world of its intemperance: so will the true
discipleship be obtained: for otherwise many enormous
consequences and pernicious effects will follow. It is to
encourage such impious persons, to continue and proceed
in the like trades of feeding the people's lusts; and thereby
such make themselves partakers of their plagues, who by
continual fresh desire to the like curiosities, and that way
of spending time and estate, induce them to spend more
time in studying how to abuse time; lest, through their
pinching and small allowance, those prodigals should call
their father's house to mind: for whatsoever any think,[216]
more pleasant baits, alluring objects, grateful entertainments,
cunning emissaries, acceptable sermons, insinuating
lectures, taking orators, the crafty devil has not ever had,
by which to entice and insnare the minds of people, and
totally to divert them from heavenly reflections and divine
meditations, than the attire, sports, plays, and pastimes of
this godless age, the school and shop of Satan, hitherto so
reasonably condemned.

CHAPTER XVIII.



1. But if these customs, &amp;c. were but indifferent, yet being abused
they deserve to be rejected.&mdash;2. The abuse is acknowledged by
those that use them, therefore should leave them.&mdash;3. Such as
pretend to seriousness should exemplarily withdraw from such
latitudes: a wise parent weans his child of what it dotes too much
upon; and we should watch over ourselves and neighbours.&mdash;4.
God, in the case of the brazen serpent, &amp;c. gives us an example
to put away the use of abused things.&mdash;5. If these things were
sometimes convenient, yet when their use is prejudicial in
example, they should be disused.&mdash;6. Such as yet proceed to love
their unlawful pleasures more than Christ and his cross; the
mischief they have brought to persons and estates, bodies and
souls.&mdash;7. Ingenuous people know this to be true: an appeal to
God's witness in the guilty: their state, that of Babylon.&mdash;8.
But temperance in food, and plainness in apparel, and sober
conversation conduce most to good: so the apostle teaches in
his epistles.&mdash;9. Temperance enriches a land: it is a political
good, as well as a religious one, in all governments.&mdash;10. When
people have done their duty to God, it will be time enough to
think of pleasing themselves.&mdash;11. An address to the magistrates
and all people, how to convert their time and money to better
purposes.


I. But should these things be as indifferent, as they are
proved perniciously unlawful; for I never heard any advance
their plea beyond the bounds of mere indifferency;
yet so great is their abuse, so universal the sad effects
thereof, like to an infection, that they therefore ought to
be rejected of all; especially those whose sobriety hath
preserved theta on this side of that excess, or whose
judgments, though themselves be guilty, suggest the folly
of such intemperance. For what is an indifferent thing,[218]
but that which may be done, or left undone? Granting,
I say, this were the case, yet do both reason and religion
teach that when they are used with such an excess of
appetite as to leave them would be a cross to their desires,
they have exceeded the bounds of mere indifferency, and
are thereby rendered no less than necessary. Which
being a violation of the very nature of the things themselves,
a perfect abuse enters; and consequently they are
no longer to be considered in the rank of things simply
indifferent, but unlawful.

II. Now that the whole exchange of things, against which
I have so earnestly contended, are generally abused by the
excess of almost all ages, sexes, and qualities of people,
will be confessed by many, who yet decline not to conform
themselves to them; and to whom, as I have understood,
it only seems lawful, because, say they, the abuse of others
should be no argument why we should not use them.
But to such I answer, That they have quite forgotten, or
will not remember, they have acknowledged these things
to be but of an indifferent nature; if so, and vanity never
urged more, I say, there can be nothing more clear, than
since they acknowledge their great abuse, that they are
wholly to be forsaken: for since they may as well be let
alone as done at any time, surely they should then of
duty be let alone, when the use of them is an abetting
the general excess, (Phil. iii. 17,) and a mere exciting
others to continue in their abuse, because they find persons
reputed sober to imitate them, or otherwise give
them an example. Precepts are not half so forcible as
examples.

III. Every one that pretends to seriousness ought to
inspect himself, as having been too forward to help on the
excess, and can never make too much haste out of those
inconveniencies that by his former example he encouraged
any to; that by a new one he may put a seasonable check[219]
upon the intemperance of others. A wise parent ever
withdraws those objects, however innocent in themselves,
which are too prevalent upon the weak senses of his
children, on purpose that they might be weaned: and it
is as frequent with men to bend a crooked stick as much
the contrary way, that they might make it straight at last.
Those that have more sobriety than others should not
forget their stewardships, but exercise that gift of God to
the security of their neighbours. It was murdering Cain
that rudely asked the Lord, "Was he his brother's
keeper?" (Gen. iv. 9.) For every man is necessarily
obliged thereto; and therefore should be so wise as to
deny himself the use of such indifferent enjoyments as
cannot be used by him without too manifest an encouragement
to his neighbour's folly.

IV. God hath sufficiently excited men to what is said;
for in the case of the brazen serpent, (2 Kings. xviii. 3, 4,)
which was a heavenly institution and type of Christ, he
with great displeasure enjoined it should be broken to
pieces, because they were too fond and doting upon it.
Yes, the very groves themselves, however pleasant for
situation, beautiful for their walks and trees, must be cut
down: and why? Only because they had been abused to
idolatrous uses. And what is an idol but that which the
mind puts an over-estimate or value upon? None can
benefit themselves so much by an indifferent thing as
others by not using that abused liberty.

V. If those things were convenient in themselves, which
is a step nearer necessity than mere indifferency, yet when
by circumstances they become prejudicial, such conveniency
itself ought to be put off; much more what is but
indifferent should be denied. People ought not to weigh
their private satisfactions more than a public good; nor
please themselves in too free a use of indifferent things, at
the cost of being so really prejudicial to the public as they[220]
certainly are, whose use of them, if no worse, becomes
exemplary to others, and begets an impatience in their
minds to have the like. Wherefore it is both reasonable
and incumbent on all to make only such things necessary
as tend to life and godliness, and to employ their freedom
with most advantage to their neighbours. (2 Pet. i. 3.)
So that here is a two-fold obligation; the one not to be
exemplary in the use of such things, which though they
may use them, yet not without giving too much countenance
to the abuse and excessive vanity of their neighbours.
The other obligation is, that they ought so far to
condescend to such religious people, who are offended at
these fashions, and that kind of conversation as to reject
them. (Rom. xiv. 1, to the end.)

VI. Now those who, notwithstanding what I have
urged, will yet proceed; what is it but that they have so
involved themselves and their affections in them, that it is
hardly possible to reform them; and that for all their
many protestations against their fondness to such fopperies,
they really love them more than Christ and his
cross. Such cannot seek the good of others, who do so
little respect their own. For, after a serious consideration,
what vanity, pride, idleness, expense of time and estates
have been and yet are! How many persons debauched
from their first sobriety, and women from their natural
sweetness and innocency to loose, airy, wanton, and many
times more enormous practices! How many plentiful
estates have been overrun by numerous debts, chastity
ensnared by accursed lustful intrigues; youthful health
overtaken by the hasty seizure of unnatural distempers,
and the remaining days of such spent upon a rack of their
vice's procuring, and so made slaves to the unmerciful but
necessary effects of their own inordinate pleasures! in
which agony they vow the greatest temperance, but are
no sooner out of it, than in their vice again. (Lam. iv. 5;[221]
Job, xxi. 13, 14; Psalm lv. 23; xxxvii. 10; Eccl. viii. 12;
Psalm xxxvii. 1, 2; Prov. ii. 22.)

VII. That these things are the case, and almost innumerable
more, I am persuaded no ingenuous person of any
experience will deny: how then, upon a serious reflection,
any that pretend conscience or the fear of God Almighty,
can longer continue in the garb, livery, and conversation
of those whose whole life tends to little else than what I
have repeated, much less join with them in their abominable
excess, I leave to the just principle in themselves to
judge. (Jer. xvi. 5-9.) No, surely! this is not to obey
the voice of God, who in all ages did loudly cry to all,
Come out of&mdash;of what?&mdash;the ways, fashions, converse, and
spirit of Babylon. (Isa. iii. 13-16; Jer. l. 8; xv. 6, 7;
Amos, vi. 3-7.) What is that? The great city of all
these vain, foolish, wanton, superfluous, and wicked practices,
against which the Scriptures denounce most dreadful
judgments; ascribing all the intemperance of men and
women to the cup of wickedness she hath given them to
drink; whose are the things indifferent, if they must be
so. And for witness, John in his revelation says in her
description: How much she hath glorified herself, and
lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her.
And the kings of the earth, who have lived deliciously
with her, shall bewail her and lament her; and the merchants
of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no
man buyeth her merchandise any more; the merchandise
of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and
fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and thyine-wood,
and all manner of vessels of ivory, and all manner
of vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron,
and marble; and cinnamon, and odours, and ointments,
and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and
wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots,
and slaves, and souls of men. (Rev. xviii. 7, 9, 11-13.)[222]
Behold the character and judgment of luxury: and though
I know it hath a further signification than what is literal,
yet there is enough to show the pomp, plenty, fulness,
idleness, ease, wantonness, vanity, lust, and excess of
luxury that reign in her. But at the terrible day, who will
go to her exchange any more? Who to her plays? Who
will follow her fashions then? And who shall traffic in
her delicate inventions? Not one; for she shall be judged.
No plea shall excuse or rescue her from the wrath of the
Judge; for strong is the Lord, who will perform it. (Rev.
xviii. 8.) If these reasonable pleas will not prevail, yet
however I shall caution such in the repetition of part of
Babylon's miserable doom: mind, my friends, more
heavenly things, hasten to obey that righteous principle
which would exercise and delight you in that which is
eternal; or else with Babylon, the mother of lust and
vanity, the fruits that your souls lust after shall depart
from you, and all things which are dainty and goodly
shall depart from you and you shall find them NO MORE:
O Dives! No more. (Rev. xviii. 14.) Lay your treasures,
therefore, up in heaven, O ye inhabitants of the earth, where
nothing can break through to harm them; but where time
shall shortly be swallowed up of eternity. (Luke, xii.
33, 34.)

VIII. But my arguments against these things end not
here: for the contrary most of all conduces to good;
namely, temperance in food, plainness in apparel, with a
meek, shame-faced, and quiet spirit, and that conversation
which doth only express the same in all godly honesty:
as the apostle saith, "Let no corrupt communication proceed
out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use
of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers;
neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, but
rather giving of thanks: for let no man deceive you with
vain words, because of these things cometh the wrath of[223]
God upon the children of disobedience." (Col. iv. 5, 6;
1 Thes. iv. 11, 12; 1 Pet. iii. 1-4; Eph. iv. 2; v. 3-6;
1 Tim. iv. 12; Phil. iii. 16-20.) And if men and women
were but thus adorned after this truly Christian manner,
impudence would soon receive a check, and lust, pride,
vanity, and wantonness find a rebuke. (1 Pet. ii. 12;
Prov. xxxi. 23-31; James, ii. 2-9.) They would not
be able to attack such universal chastity or encounter such
godly austerity: virtue would be in credit, and vice afraid
and ashamed, and excess not dare to show its face. There
would be an end of gluttony and gaudiness of apparel,
flattering titles, and a luxurious life; (2 Pet. iii. 11; Psal.
xxvi. 6;) and then primitive innocency and plainness
would come back again, and that plain-hearted, downright,
harmless life would be restored, of not much caring what
we should eat, drink, or put on, (Luke, xii. 22-30,) as
Christ tells us the Gentiles did, and as we know this age
daily does, under all its talk of religion; but as the
ancients, who with moderate care for necessaries and conveniencies
of life, devoted themselves to the concernments
of a celestial kingdom, and more minded their improvement
in righteousness than their increase in riches; for
they laid their treasure up in heaven, (Matt. xxv. 21,) and
endured tribulation for an inheritance that cannot be taken
away.

IX. But the temperance I plead for is not only religiously
but politically good: it is the interest of good
government to curb and rebuke excesses: it prevents many
mischiefs. Luxury brings effeminacy, laziness, poverty,
and misery; (Prov. x. 4; Eccl. x. 16-18;) but temperance
preserves the land. It keeps out foreign vanities,
and improves our own commodities: now we are their
debtors; then they would be debtors to us for our native
manufactures. By this means, such persons who by their
excess, not charity, have deeply engaged their estates, may[224]
in a short space be enabled to clear them from those
incumbrances which otherwise, like moths, soon eat out
plentiful revenues. It helps persons of mean substance to
improve their small stocks, that they may not expend
their dear earnings, and hard-got wages upon superfluous
apparel, foolish May-games, plays, dancings, shows,
taverns, ale-houses, and the like folly and intemperance,
of which this land is more infested, and by which it is
rendered more ridiculous than any kingdom in the world:
for none I know of is so infested with cheating mountebanks,
savage morrice-dancers, pick-pockets, and profane
players, and stagers, to the slight of religion, the shame of
government, and the great idleness, expense, and debauchery
of the people: for which the Spirit of the Lord
is grieved, and the judgments of the Almighty are at the
door, and the sentence ready to be pronounced, "Let him
that is unjust be unjust still." (Rev. xxii. 11; Eccl. xii. 1.)
Wherefore it is that we cannot but loudly call upon the
generality of the times, and testify both by our life and
doctrine against the like vanities and abuses, if possibly
any may be weaned from their folly, and choose the good
old path of temperance, wisdom, gravity, and holiness, the
only way to inherit the blessings of peace and plenty here,
and eternal happiness hereafter.

X. Lastly, supposing we had none of these foregoing
reasons justly to reprove the practice of the land in these
particulars; however, let it be sufficient for us to say, that
when people have first learned to fear, worship, and obey
their Creator, to pay their numerous vicious debts, to alleviate
and abate their oppressed tenants; but above all
outward regards, when the pale faces are more commiserated,
when the famished poor, the distressed widow,
and helpless orphan, God's works, and your fellow-creatures,
are provided for; then, I say, if then, it will be time
enough for you to plead the indifferency of your pleasures.[225]
But that the sweet and tedious labour of the husbandman,
early and late, cold and hot, wet and dry, should be converted
into the pleasure, ease, and pastime of a small
number of men; that the cart, the plough, the flail, should
be in that continual severity laid upon nineteen parts of
the land, to feed the inordinate lusts and delicious appetites
of the twentieth, is so far from the appointment of
the great Governor of the world, and God of the spirits of
all flesh, that, to imagine such horrible injustice as the
effects of his determinations, and not the intemperance of
men, were wretched and blasphemous. As on the other
side, it would be to deserve no pity, no help, no relief
from God Almighty, for people to continue that expense
in vanity and pleasure, whilst the great necessities of such
objects go unanswered; especially since God hath made
the sons of men but stewards to each other's exigencies and
relief. Yea, so strict is it enjoined, that on the omission
of these things, we find this dreadful sentence partly to be
grounded, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting
fire," &amp;c. (Matt. xxv. 34-41.) As on the contrary, to
visit the sick, see the imprisoned, relieve the needy, &amp;c.
are such excellent properties in Christ's account, that
thereupon He will pronounce such blessed, saying, "Come,
ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
you," &amp;c. (Matt. xxv. 34-41.) So that the great are
not, with the leviathan in the deep, to prey upon the small,
much less to make a sport of the lives and labours of the
lesser ones, to gratify their inordinate senses.

XI. I therefore humbly offer an address to the serious
consideration of the civil magistrate, that, if the money
which is expended in every parish in such vain fashions
as wearing of laces, jewels, embroideries, unnecessary
ribbons, trimmings, costly furniture, and attendance, together
with what is commonly consumed in taverns, feasts,
gaming, &amp;c. could be collected into a public stock, or[226]
something in lieu of this extravagant and fruitless expense,
there might be reparation to the broken tenants, workhouses
for the able, and alms-houses for the aged and impotent.
Then should we have no beggars in the land, the
cry of the widow and the orphan would cease, and charitable
relief might easily be afforded towards the redemption
of poor captives, and the refreshment of such distressed
Protestants as labour under the miseries of persecution in
other countries: nay, the Exchequer's needs, on just
emergencies, might be supplied by such a bank: this
sacrifice and service would please the just and merciful
God: it would be a noble example of gravity and temperance
to foreign states, and an unspeakable benefit to
ourselves at home.

Alas! why should men need persuasions to what their
own felicity so necessarily leads them? Had these
vitiosos of the times but a sense of heathen Cato's generosity,
they would rather deny their carnal appetites than
leave such noble enterprises unattempted. But that they
should eat, drink, play, game, and sport away their health,
estates, and, above all, their irrevocable precious time,
which should be dedicated to the Lord, as a necessary introduction
to a blessed eternity, and than which, did they
but know it, no worldly solace would come in competition:
I say, that they should be continually employed about
these poor, low things is to have the heathens judge them
in God's days, as well as Christian precepts and examples
condemn them. And their final doom will prove the more
astonishing, in that this vanity and excess are acted under
a profession of the self-denying religion of Jesus, whose
life and doctrine are a perpetual reproach to the most of
Christians. For He was humble, but they are proud; He
forgiving, they revengeful; He meek, they fierce; He plain,
they gaudy; He abstemious, they luxurious; He chaste,
they lascivious: He a pilgrim on earth, they citizens of[227]
the world: in fine, He was meanly born, poorly attended,
and obscurely brought up; He lived despised, and died
hated of the men of his own nation. O you pretended
followers of this crucified Jesus! examine yourselves, try
yourselves, know you not your own selves; if He dwell
not, if He rule not in you, that you are reprobates? Be
ye not deceived, for God will not be mocked, (at last with
forced repentances,) such as you sow, such you must reap.
(1 Cor. xiii. 5; Gal. vi. 8.) I beseech you to hear me,
and remember you were invited and entreated to the salvation
of God. I say; as you sow, you reap: if you are
enemies to the cross of Christ,&mdash;and you are so if you will
not bear it, but do as you list, and not as you ought;&mdash;if you
are uncircumcised in heart and ear, and you are so, if you
will not hear, and open to Him that knocks at the door
within, and if you resist and quench the Spirit in yourselves,
that strives with you, to bring you to God, (and
that you certainly do who rebel against its motions,
reproofs, and instructions,) then you sow to the flesh, to
fulfil the lusts thereof, and of the flesh will you reap the
fruits of corruption, (Rom. ii. 8,) woe, anguish, and tribulation,
from God, the Judge of quick and dead, by Jesus
Christ. But if you will daily bear the holy cross of Christ,
and sow to the Spirit; if you will listen to the light and
grace that comes by Jesus, and which He has given to all
people for salvation, and square your thoughts, words, and
deeds thereby, which leads and teaches the lovers of it to
deny all ungodliness and the world's lusts, and to live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present evil world,
then may you with confidence look for the blessed hope
and joyful coming, and glorious appearance of the great
God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. ii. 11-13.) Let
it be so, O you Christians, and escape the wrath to come!
Why will you die? Let the time past suffice: remember,
that No Cross, no Crown. Redeem then the time, for the[228]
days are evil, (Eph. v. 16,) and yours are but very few.
Therefore gird up the loins of your minds, be sober, fear,
watch, pray, and endure to the end; calling to mind for
your encouragement and consolation, that all such as
through patience and well-doing wait for immortality,
(Rom. ii. 7,) shall reap glory, honour, and eternal life in
the kingdom of the Father: whose is the kingdom, the
power, and the glory for ever. Amen.

PREFACE.


No Cross, No Crown, should have ended here; but that the
power which examples and authorities have put upon the minds of
the people, above the most reasonable and pressing arguments,
inclined me to present my readers with some of those many instances
that might be given, in favour of the virtuous life recommended in
our discourse. I chose to cast them into three sorts of testimonies,
not after the threefold subject of the book; but suitable to the
times, qualities, and circumstances of the persons that gave them
forth; whose divers excellencies and stations have transmitted their
names with reputation to our own times. The first testimony
comes from those called Heathens; the second from professed
Christians; and the last, from retired, aged, and dying men; being
their last and serious reflections, to which no ostentation or worldly
interests could induce them. Where it will be easy for the considerate
reader to observe, how much the pride, avarice, and luxury
of the world stood reprehended in the judgments of persons of
great credit amongst men; and what was that life and conduct,
that in their most retired meditations, when their sight was clearest,
and judgment most free and disabused, they thought would give
peace here, and lay foundations of eternal blessedness.

CHAPTER XIX.



The Testimonies of several great, learned, and virtuous
personages among the Gentiles, urged against the excesses
of the age, in favour of the self-denial, temperance,
and piety, recommended in the first part of this discourse.


I. AMONG THE GREEKS, &amp;c. viz.



1. Cyrus.&mdash;2. Artaxerxes.&mdash;3. Agathocles.&mdash;4. Philip.&mdash;5. Ptolemy.&mdash;6.
Xenophanes.&mdash;7. Antigonus.&mdash;8. Themistocles.&mdash;9. Aristides.&mdash;10.
Pericles.&mdash;11. Phocion.&mdash;12. Clitomachus.&mdash;13. Epaminondas.&mdash;14.
Demosthenes.&mdash;15. Agasicles.&mdash;16. Agesilaus.&mdash;17.
Agis.&mdash;18. Alcamenes.&mdash;19. Alexandrides.&mdash;20. Anaxilas.&mdash;21.
Ariston.&mdash;22. Archidamus.&mdash;23. Cleomenes.&mdash;24. Dersyllidas.&mdash;25.
Hippodamus.&mdash;26. Leonidas.&mdash;27. Lysander.&mdash;28. Pausanias.&mdash;29.
Theopompus, &amp;c.&mdash;30. The manner of life and
government of the Lacedæmonians in general.&mdash;31. Lycurgus
their lawgiver.

I. Cyrus, than whom a greater monarch we hardly find
in story, is more famous for his virtue than his power;
God calls him his shepherd. Now let us see the principles
of his conduct and life. So temperate was he in his youth,
that when Astyages, urged him to drink wine, he answered,
"I am afraid lest there should be poison in it, having seen
thee reel and sottish after having drunk thereof." And so careful
was he to keep the Persians from corruption of manners,
that he would not suffer them to leave their rude and
mountainous country, for one more pleasant and fruitful,
lest through plenty and ease, luxury at last might debase
their spirits. And so very chaste was he, that having[234]
taken a lady of quality, a most beautiful woman, his prisoner,
he refused to see her, saying, "I have no mind to
be a captive to my captive." It seems, he claimed no
such propriety; but shunned the occasion of evil. The
comptroller of his household asking him one day what he
would please to have for his dinner; "Bread," said he;
"for I intend to encamp nigh the water:" a short and easy
bill of fare: but this shows the power he had over his
appetite as well as his soldiers; and that he was fit to
command others, that could command himself: according
to another saying of his, "No man," saith he, "is worthy to
command, who is not better than those who are to obey."
And when he came to die, he gave this reason of his
belief of immortality; "I cannot," said he, "persuade
myself to think that the soul of man, after having sustained
itself in a mortal body, should perish when delivered out
of it, for want of it;" a saying of perhaps as great weight,
as may be advanced against Atheism, from more enlightened
times.

II. Artaxerxes Mnemon, being upon an extraordinary
occasion reduced to eat barley bread, and dried figs, and
drink water, "What pleasure," saith he, "have I lost till
now, through my delicacies and excess!"

III. Agathocles becoming king of Sicily, from being
the son of a potter, always to humble his mind to his
original, would be daily served in earthen vessels upon his
table: an example of humility and plainness.

IV. Philip, king of Macedon, upon three sorts of good
news, arrived in one day, feared too much success might
transport him immoderately; and therefore prayed for
some disappointments to season his prosperity, and caution
his mind under the enjoyment of it. He refused to
oppress the Greeks with his garrisons, saying, "I had
rather retain them by kindness than fear, and to be
always beloved, than for a while terrible." One of his[235]
minions persuading him to decline hearing a cause,
wherein a particular friend was interested, "I had much
rather," says he, "thy friend shall lose his cause, than I
my reputation." Seeing his son, Alexander, endeavouring
to gain the hearts of the Macedonians, by gifts and
rewards, "Canst thou believe," says he, "that a man that
thou hast corrupted to thy interests, will ever be true to
them?" When his court would have had him quarrel with
and correct the Peloponnenses for their ingratitude to him,
he said, "By no means; for if they despise and abuse me
after being kind to them, what will they do if I do them
harm?"&mdash;a great example of patience in a king, and
wittily said. Like to this was his reply to the ambassadors
of Athens, whom asking after audience, if he could do them
any service, and one of them surlily answering, The best
thou canst do us is to hang thyself, he was nothing disturbed,
though his court murmured; but calmly said to
the ambassador, "Those who suffer injuries are better
people than those that do them." To conclude with him:
being one day fallen along the ground, and seeing himself
in that posture he cried out, "What a small spot of earth
do we take up, and yet the whole world cannot content
us!"

V. Ptolemy, son of Lagus, being reproached for his
mean original, and his friends angry that he did not
resent it; "We ought," says he, "to bear reproaches patiently."

VI. Xenophanes being jeered for refusing to play at a
forbidden game, answered: "I do not fear my money,
but my reputation: they that make laws, must keep them."
A commendable saying.

VII. Antigonus being taken sick, he said, it was a
warning from God to instruct him of his mortality. A
poet flattered him with the title of the Son of God, he
answered, "My servant knows the contrary." Another[236]
sycophant telling him, that the will of kings is the rule of
justice: "No," saith he, "rather justice is the rule of the
will of kings;" and being pressed by his minions to put a
garrison into Athens, to hold the Greeks in subjection, he
answered, "he had not a stronger garrison than the affections
of his people."

VIII. Themistocles, after all the honour of his life, sits
down with this conclusion, "That the way to the grave is
more desirable than the way to worldly honours." His
daughter being courted by one of little wit and great
wealth, and another of little wealth and great goodness;
he chose the poor man for his son-in-law: "For," saith
he, "I will rather have a man without money, than money
without a man;" reckoning, that not money, but worth,
makes the man. Being told by Symmachus, that he would
teach him the art of memory; he gravely answered, he
had rather learn the art of forgetfulness: adding, he
could remember enough, but many things he could not
forget, which were necessary to be forgotten: as the
honours, glories, pleasures, and conquests he had spent his
days in: too apt to transport to vain glory.

IX. Aristides, a wise and just Greek, of greatest honour
and trust with the Athenians;&mdash;he was a great enemy to
cabals in government: the reason he renders is, "Because,"
saith he, "I would not be obliged to authorize injustice."
He so much hated covetousness, though he was thrice
chosen treasurer of Athens, that he lived and died poor,
and that of choice: for being therefore reproached by a
rich usurer, he answered, "Thy riches hurt thee more than
my poverty hurts me." Being once banished by a contrary
faction in the state, he prayed to God, that the
affairs of his country might go so well, as never to need
his return: which however caused him presently to be
recalled: whereupon he told them, that he was not troubled
for his exile with respect to himself, but the honour[237]
of his country. Themistocles, their general, had a project
to propose, to render Athens mistress of Greece, but it
required secrecy: the people obliged him to communicate
it to Aristides, whose judgment they would follow.
Aristides having privately heard it from Themistocles,
publicly answered the people, "True there was nothing
more advantageous, nothing more unjust:" which quashed
the project.

X. Pericles, as he mounted the tribunal, prayed to
God that not a word might fall from him, that might
scandalize the people, wrong the public affairs, or hurt
his own. One of his friends praying him to speak falsely
in his favour; "We are friends," saith he, "but not
beyond the altar;" meaning not against religion and truth.
Sophocles being his companion, upon sight of a beautiful
woman, said to Pericles, "Ah, what a lovely creature is
that!" To whom Pericles replied, "It becometh a magistrate
not only to have his hands clean, but his tongue
and eyes also."

XI. Phocion, a famous Athenian, was honest and poor,
yea, he contemned riches: for a certain governor making
rich presents, he returned them; saying, "I refused
Alexander's." And when several persuaded him to accept
of such bounty, or else his children would want, he answered,
"If my son be virtuous, I shall leave him enough;
and if he be vicious, more would be too little." He
rebuked the excess of the Athenians, and that openly;
saying, "He that eateth more than he ought, maketh more
diseases than he can cure." To condemn or flatter him,
was to him alike. Antipater pressing him to submit
to his sense, he answered, "Thou canst not have me
for thy friend and flatterer too." Seeing a man in office
to speak much, and do little, he asked, "How can that
man do business, that is always drunk with talking?"
After all the great services of his life, he was unjustly[238]
condemned to die; and going to the place of execution,
lamented by the people, one of his enemies spit in his
face; he took it without any disorder of mind, only
saying, "Take him away." Before execution, his friends
asked him, whether he had nothing to say to his
son? "Yes," said he, "let him not hate my enemies, nor
revenge my death: I see it is better to sleep on the earth
with peace, than with trouble upon the softest bed: that
he ought to do that which is his duty; and what is more
is vanity: that he must not carry two faces: that he
promise little, but keep his promises: the world does the
contrary."

XII. Clitomachus had so great a love to virtue, and
practised it with such exactness, that if at any time in
company he heard wanton or obscene discourse, he was
wont to quit the place.

XIII. Epaminondas being invited to a sacrificial feast,
so soon as he entered he withdrew, because of the sumptuous
furniture and attire of the place and people; saying,
"I was called at Leurtra to a sacrifice, but I find it is a
debauch." The day after the great battle he obtained
upon his enemies, he seemed sad and solitary, which was
not his ordinary temper; and being asked why, answered,
"I would moderate the joy of yesterday's triumphs." A
Thessalian general, and his colleague in a certain enterprise,
knowing his poverty, sent him two thousand crowns
to defray his part of the charges; but he seemed angry,
and answered, "This looks like corrupting me;" contenting
himself with less than five pounds, which he borrowed
of one of his friends for that service. The same moderation
made him refuse the presents of the Persian emperor,
saying, "They were needless if he only desired of him
what was just; if more, he was not rich enough to corrupt
him." Seeing a rich man refuse to lend one of his friends
money that was in affliction, he said, "Art not thou[239]
ashamed to refuse to help a good man in necessity?"
After he had freed Greece from trouble, and made the
Thebans, his countrymen, triumph over the Lacedæmonians,
till then invincible, that ungrateful people arraigned
him and his friends, under pretence of acting something
without authority: he, as general, took the blame upon
himself, justified the action both from necessity and success,
arraigning his judges for ingratitude whilst himself
was at the bar, which caused them to withdraw with fallen
countenances, and hearts smitten with guilt and fear. To
conclude, he was a man of great truth and patience, as
well as wisdom and courage; for he was never observed
to lie in earnest or in jest. And notwithstanding the ill
and cross humours of the Thebans, aggravated by his
incomparable hazards and services for their freedom and
renown, it is reported of him that he ever bore them
patiently, often saying that he ought no more to be revenged
of his country than of his father.

XIV. Demosthenes, the great orator of Athens, had these
sentences: "That wise men speak little, and that therefore
nature hath given men two ears and one tongue, to hear
more than they speak." To one that spoke much he said,
"How cometh it that he who taught thee to speak, did
not teach thee to hold thy tongue?" He said of a covetous
man, "That he knew not how to live all his lifetime, and
that he left it for another to live after he was dead. That
it was an easy thing to deceive one's self, because it was
easy to persuade one's self to what one desired." He said,
"That calumnies were easily received, but time would
always discover them. That there was nothing more
uneasy to good men than not to have the liberty of speaking
freely; and that if any one knew what he had to suffer
from the people, he would never meddle to govern them.
In fine, that man's happiness was to be like God; and to
resemble Him, we must love truth and justice."

[240]

XV. Agasicles, king of the Lacedæmonians, or Spartans,
which are one, was of the opinion that it was better
to govern without force: and, says he, the means to do it
is to govern the people as a father governs his children.

XVI. Agesilaus, king of the same people, would say,
that he had rather be master of himself than of the greatest
city of his enemies: and to preserve his own liberty than
to usurp the liberty of another man. "A prince," says
he, "ought to distinguish himself from his subjects by his
virtue, and not by his state or delicacy of life." Wherefore
he wore plain, simple clothing; his table was as moderate
and his bed as hard as that of any ordinary subject. And
when he was told that one time or other he would be
obliged to change his fashion: "No," saith he, "I am
not given to change even in a change: and this I do,"
saith he, "to remove from young men any pretence of
luxury, that they may see their prince practise what he
counsels them to do." He added, "That the foundation
of the Lacedæmonian laws was to despise luxury, and to
reward with liberty; nor," saith he, "should good men
put a value upon that which mean and base souls make
their delight." Being flattered by some with divine
honour, he asked them if they could not make gods too?
If they could why did they not begin with themselves?&mdash;The
same austere conduct of life made him refuse to have
his statue erected in the cities of Asia: nor would he
suffer his picture to be taken; and his reason is good:
"for," saith he, "the fairest portraiture of men is their
own actions."&mdash;Whatsoever was to be suddenly done in
the government, he was sure to set his hand first to the
work, like a common person. He would say, it did not
become men to make provision to be rich but to be good.
Being asked the means to true happiness; he answered,
"To do nothing that should make a man fear to die:"
another time, "To speak well, and do well." Being[241]
called home by the ephori, or supreme magistrates, the
way of the Spartan constitution, he returned, saying, "It
is not less the duty of a prince to obey laws than to command
men." He conferred places of trust and honour
upon his enemies, that he might constrain their hatred
into love. A lawyer asking him for a letter to make a
person judge that was of his own friends; "My friends,"
says he, "have no need of recommendation to do justice."&mdash;A
comedian of note, wondering that Agesilaus said
nothing to him, asked if he knew him; "Yes," said he,
"art not thou the buffoon Callipedes?" One calling the
king of Persia the Great king, he answered, "He is not
greater than I unless he hath more virtue than I."&mdash;One of
his friends catching him playing with his children, he
prevented him thus: "Say nothing till thou art a father
too."&mdash;He had great care of the education of youth, often
saying, "We must teach children what they should do
when they are men." The Egyptians despising him because
he had but a small train and a mean equipage;
"Oh," said he, "I will have them to know royalty consists
not in vain pomp but in virtue."

XVII. Agis, another king of Lacedæmon, imprisoned
for endeavouring to restore their declining discipline, being
asked whether he repented not of his design; answered,
"No; for," saith he, "good actions never need repentance."
His father and mother desiring of him to grant
something he thought unjust, he answered, "I obeyed you
when I was young; I must now obey the laws, and do
that which is reasonable."&mdash;As he was leading to the
place of execution one of his people wept, to whom he
said, "Weep not for me; for the authors of this unjust
death are more in fault than I."

XVIII. Alcamenes, king of the same people, being asked
which was the way to get and preserve honour; answered,
"To despise wealth." Another wondering why he refused[242]
the presents of the Messenians, he answered, "I make
conscience to keep the laws that forbid it." To a miser,
accusing him of being so reserved in his discourse, he
said, "I had rather conform to reason than thy covetousness;
or, I had rather be covetous of my words than
money."

XIX. Alexandrides hearing an exile complain of his
banishment, saith he, "Complain of the cause of it, to wit,
his deserts, for there is nothing hurtful but vice." Being
asked why they were so long in making the process of
criminals in Lacedæmon, "Because," saith he, "when
they are once dead they are past repentance." This shows
their belief of immortality and eternal blessedness; and
that even poor criminals, through repentance, may obtain
it.

XX. Anaxilas would say that the greatest advantage
kings had upon other men was their power of excelling
them in good deeds.

XXI. Ariston hearing one admire this expression,
"We ought to do good to our friends and evil to our
enemies;" answered, "By no means; we ought to do
good to all; to keep our friends and to gain our enemies."
A doctrine the most difficult to flesh and blood in all the
precepts of Christ's sermon upon the mount: nay, not
allowed to be his doctrine, but both an eye for an eye,
defended against his express command, and oftentimes an
eye put out, an estate sequestered, and life taken away
under a specious zeal for religion too; as if sin could be
christened, and impiety entitled to the doctrine of Christ:
O, will not such heathens rise up in judgment against our
worldly Christians in the great day of God!

XXII. Archidamus also, king of Sparta, being asked
who was master of Lacedæmonia; "The laws," saith he,
"and after them the magistrates." One praising a musician
in his presence, "Ah!" saith he, "but when wilt[243]
thou praise a good man?"&mdash;Another saying, that man is
an excellent musician: "That is all one," saith he, "as if
thou wouldst say, there is a good cook:" counting both
trades of voluptuousness.&mdash;Another promising him some
excellent wine; "I care not," saith he, "for it will only
put my mouth out of taste to my ordinary liquor;" which
it seems was water.&mdash;Two men chose him an arbitrator;
to accept it, he made them promise to do what he would
have them: "Then," said he, "stir not from this place
till you have agreed the matter between yourselves," which
was done.&mdash;Dionysius, king of Sicily, sending his daughters
rich apparel, he forbad them to wear it, saying, "You will
seem to me but the more homely." This great man certainly
was not of the mind to breed up his children at the
exchanges, dancing-schools, and play-houses.

XXIII. Cleomenes, king of the same people, would say,
"That kings ought to be pleasant; but not to cheapness
and contempt." He was so just a man in power, that he
drove away Demaratus his fellow-king, (for they always
had two,) for offering to corrupt him in a cause before
them, "Lest," saith he, "he should attempt others less
able to resist him, and so ruin the state."

XXIV. Dersyllidas perceiving that Pyrrhus would force
a prince upon his countrymen, the Lacedæmonians, whom
they lately rejected, stoutly opposed him, saying, "If thou
art God, we fear thee not, because we have done no evil;
and if thou art but a man we are men too."

XXV. Hippodamus seeing a young man ashamed,
that was caught in bad company, he reproved him
sharply, saying, "For time to come, keep such company
as thou needest not blush at."

XXVI. Leonidas, brother to Cleomenes, being offered
by Xerxes to be made an emperor of Greece, answered,
"I had rather die for my own country, than have an unjust
command over other men's;" adding, "Xerxes deceived[244]
himself, to think it a virtue to invade the right of other
men."

XXVII. Lysander being asked by a person, what was
the best frame of government; "That," says he, "where
every man hath according to his deserts." Though one
of the greatest captains that Sparta bred, he had learned
by his wisdom to bear personal affronts: "Say what thou
wilt," says he to one that spoke abusively to him, "empty
thyself, I shall bear it." His daughters were contracted
in marriage to some persons of quality, but he dying poor,
they refused to marry them; upon which the ephori
condemned each of them in a great sum of money, because
they preferred money before faith and engagement.

XXVIII. Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus, and colleague
of Lysander, beholding, among the Persian spoils they took,
the costliness of their furniture, said, "It had been much
better if they had been worth less, and their masters
more." And after the victory of Platæa, having a dinner
dressed according to the Persian manner, and beholding
the magnificence and furniture of the treat; "What,"
saith he, "do these people mean, that live in such wealth
and luxury, to attack our meanness and poverty?"

XXIX. Theopompus saith, "The way to preserve a
kingdom, is to embrace the counsel of one's friends, and
not to suffer the meaner sort to be oppressed." One
making the glory of Sparta to consist in commanding
well, he answered, "No, it is in knowing how to obey
well." He was of opinion, that great honours hurt a
state; adding, that time would abolish great, and augment
moderate honours among men; meaning, that men should
have the reputation they deserve, without flattery and
excess.

A rhetorician, bragging himself of his art, was reproved
by a Lacedæmonian; "Dost thou call that an art," saith
he, "which hath not truth for its object?" Also a Lacedæmonian[245]
being presented with a harp after dinner, by a
musical person, "I do not," saith he, "know how to play
the fool." Another being asked, what he thought of a
poet of the times, answered, "Good for nothing but to
corrupt youth." Nor was this only the wisdom and
virtue of some particular persons, which may be thought
to have given light to the dark body of their courts; but
their government was wise and just, and the people generally
obeyed it; making virtue to be true honour, and that
honour dearer to them than life.

XXX. Lacedæmonian customs, according to Plutarch,
were these: they were very temperate in their eating and
drinking, their most delicate dish being a pottage made
for the nourishment of ancient people. They taught their
children to write and read, to obey the magistrates, to
endure labour, and to be bold in danger: the teachers of
other sciences were not so much as admitted in Lacedæmonia.&mdash;They
had but one garment, and that new once a
year. They rarely used baths or oil, the custom of those
parts of the world.&mdash;They accustomed their youth to
travel by night without light, to use them not to be
afraid.&mdash;The old governed the young; and those of
them who obeyed not the aged, were punished.&mdash;It was a
shame not to bear reproof among the youth; and among
the aged, matter of punishment not to give it. They
made ordinary cheer, on purpose to keep out luxury;
holding, that mean fare kept the spirit free, and the body
fit for action. They permitted not their youth to
travel, lest they should corrupt their manners; and for the
same reason they permitted not strangers to dwell amongst
them, that conformed not to their way of living. In this
they were so strict, that such of their youth that were not
educated in their customs, enjoyed not the privileges of
natives. They would suffer neither comedies nor tragedies
to be acted in their country. They condemned a soldier[246]
but for painting his buckler of several colours: and publicly
punished a young man for having learned but the
way to a town given to luxury. They also banished an
orator for bragging, that he could speak a whole day upon
any subject: for they did not like much speaking, much
less for a bad cause.&mdash;They buried their dead without any
ceremony or superstition; for they only used a red cloth
upon the body, broidered with olive leaves; this burial
had all degrees. Mourning they forbad, and epitaphs
too.&mdash;When they prayed to God, they stretched forth
their arms, which with them was a sign that they must do
good works, as well as make good prayers. They asked
of God but two things, patience in labour, and happiness
in well-doing.

This account is mostly the same with Xenophon's: adding,
that they ate moderately, and in common: the aged
mixed with the youth, to awe them, and give them good
example.&mdash;When they were fifteen years of age, instead
of leaving them to their own conduct, as in other places,
they had most care of their conversation, that they might
preserve them from the mischiefs that age is incident to.
And those that would not comply with these rules, were
not counted always honest people.&mdash;And in this, their
government was excellent; that they thought there was
no greater punishment for a bad man, than to be known
and used as such, at all times, and in all places; for they
were not to come into the company of persons of reputation.&mdash;They
were to give place to all others; to stand
when they sat; to be accountable to every honest man
that met them of their conversation.&mdash;That they must keep
their poor kindred.&mdash;That they used not the same freedoms
that honest people might use: by which means they
kept virtue in credit, and vice in contempt.&mdash;They used
all things necessary for life, without superfluity or want;
despising riches, and sumptuous apparel, and living:[247]
judging, that the best ornament of the body is health, and
of the mind, virtue. "And since," saith Xenophon, "it is
virtue and temperance that render us commendable, and
that it is only the Lacedæmonians that reverence them
publicly, and have made it the foundation of their state;
their government, of right, merits preference to any other
in the world. But that," saith he, "which is strange, is,
that all admire it, but none imitate it." Nor is this account
and judgment fantastical.

XXXI. Lycurgus, their famous founder and lawgiver,
instilled these principles, and by his power with them,
made them laws to rule them. Let us hear what he did:
Lycurgus, willing to retire his citizens from a luxurious to
a virtuous life, and show them how much good conduct
and honest industry might meliorate the state of mankind,
applied himself to introduce a new model of government,
persuading them to believe, that though they were descended
of noble and virtuous ancestors, if they were not
exercised in a course of virtue, they would, like the dog
in the kitchen, rather leap at the meat than run at the
game. In fine, they agreed to obey him. The first thing
then that he did to try his power with them, was, to
divide the land into equal portions, so that the whole
Laconic country seemed but the lots of brethren: this
grieved the rich; but the poor, which were the most,
rejoiced.&mdash;He rendered wealth useless by community;
and forbad the use of gold and silver: he made money of
iron, too base and heavy to make a thief. He retrenched
their laws of building, suffering no more ornament than
could be made with a hatchet and a saw: and their
furniture was like their houses. This course disbanded
many trades: no merchant, no cook, no lawyer, no flatterer,
no divine, no astrologer, was to be found in Lacedæmonia.
Injustice was banished, their society having cut up the
root of it, which is avarice, by introducing a community,[248]
and making gold and silver useless. To prevent the
luxury of tables, as well as of apparel, he ordained public
places of eating, where all should publicly be served;
those that refused to come thither, were reputed voluptuous
and reproved, if not corrected. He forbad costly offerings
in the temple, that they might offer often; for that God
regardeth the heart, not the offering.&mdash;These and some
more, were the laws he instituted; and whilst the Spartans
kept them, it is certain they were the first state of Greece;
which lasted about five hundred years. It is remarkable,
that he would never suffer the laws to be written,
to avoid barratry; and that the judges might not be tied
religiously to the letter of the law; but left to the circumstances
of fact; in which no inconvenience was observed
to follow.


II. The Romans also yielded us instances to our point
in hand, viz.



1. Cato.&mdash;2. Scipio Africanus.&mdash;3. Augustus.&mdash;4. Vespasian.&mdash;5.
Trajan.&mdash;6. Adrian.&mdash;7. Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.&mdash;8. Pertinax.&mdash;9.
Pescennius.&mdash;10. Alexander Severus.&mdash;11. Dioclesian.&mdash;12.
Theodosius.

1. Cato, that sage Roman, seeing a luxurious man loaded
with flesh, "Of what service," saith he, "can that man be,
either to himself, or the commonwealth?" One day beholding
the statues of several persons erecting, that he
thought little worthy of remembrance, that he might
despise the pride of it, "I had rather," said he, "they
should ask, why they set not up a statue to Cato, than
why they do."&mdash;He was a man of severity of life, both
example and judge.&mdash;His competitors in the government,
hoping to be preferred, took the contrary humour, and
mightily flattered the people: this good man despised
their arts, and with an unusual fervency cried out, "That
the distempers of the commonwealth did not require[249]
flatterers to deceive them, but physicians to cure them;"
which struck so great an awe upon the people, that he
was first chosen of them all.&mdash;The fine dames of Rome
became governors to their husbands; he lamented the
change, saying, "It is strange that those who command
the world should yet be subject to women."&mdash;He thought
those judges, that would not impartially punish malefactors,
greater criminals than the malefactors themselves: a
good lesson for judges of the world. He would say,
That it was better to lose a gift than a correction; "for,"
says he, "the one corrupts us, but the other instructs us.&mdash;That
we ought not to separate honour from virtue; for
then there would be few any more virtuous." He would
say, "No man is fit to command another, that cannot
command himself. Great men should be temperate in
their power, that they may keep it. For men to be too
long in offices in a government, is to have too little regard
to others, or the dignity of the state. They that do
nothing, will learn to do evil. That those who have
raised themselves by their vices, should gain to themselves
credit by virtue." He repented him, that ever he passed
away one day without doing good. And that there is no
witness any man ought to fear, but that of his own conscience.
Nor did his practice fall much short of his
principles.

II. Scipio Africanus, though a great general, loaded
with honours and triumphs, preferred retirement to them
all; being used to say, That he was never less alone, than
when he was alone: implying, that the most busy men in
the world, are the most destitute of themselves; and,
that external solitariness gives the best company within.
After he had taken Carthage, his soldiers brought him a
most beautiful prisoner; he answered, "I am your general;"
refusing to debase himself, or dishonour her.

III. Augustus eating at the table of one of his friends, where[250]
a poor slave breaking a crystal vessel, fell upon his knees,
begging him that his master might not fling him to the
lampreys; as he had use to do for food, with such of them
that offended him: Augustus hating his friend's cruelty,
broke all his friend's crystal vessels, both reproving
his luxury and his severity. He never recommended any
of his own children, but he always added, If they deserve
it. He reproved his daughter for her excess in apparel,
and both rebuked and imprisoned her for her immodest
latitudes. The people of Rome complaining that wine
was dear, he sent them to the fountains, telling them they
were cheap.

IV. Vespasian was a great and an extraordinary man,
who maintained something of the Roman virtue in his
time. One day seeing a young man finely dressed, and
richly perfumed, he was displeased with him, saying, "I
had rather smell the poor man's garlic, than thy perfume:"
and took his place and government from him. A certain
person being brought before him, that had conspired
against him, he reproved him, and said, "That it was
God who gave and took away empires." Another time
conferring favour upon his enemy, and being asked why
he did so, he answered, that he should remember the
right way.

V. Trajan would say, "That it became an emperor to
act towards his people, as he would have his people act
towards him." The governor of Rome having delivered
the sword into his hand, and created him emperor; "Here,"
saith he, "take it again: if I reign well, use it for me: if
ill, use it against me." An expression which shows
great humility and goodness, making power subservient to
virtue.

VI. Adrian, also emperor, had several sayings worthy
of notice: one was, "That a good prince did not think
the estates of his subjects belonging to him." He would[251]
say, "That kings should not act the king:" that is,
should be just, and mix sweetness with greatness, and be
conversible with good men. "That the treasures of princes
are like the spleen, that never swells, but it makes other
parts shrink:" teaching princes thereby to spare their
subjects.&mdash;Meeting one that was his enemy before he was
emperor, he cried out to him, "Now thou hast no more to
fear:" intimating, that, having power to revenge himself,
he would rather use it to do him good.

VII. Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, a good man, (the
Christians of his time felt it,) commended his son for
weeping at his tutor's death, answering those that would
have rendered it unsuitable to his condition, "Let him
alone," says he, "it is fit he should show himself a man,
before he be a prince." He did nothing in the government
without consulting his friends, and would say,
"It is more just that one should follow the advice of
many, than many the mind of one." He was more
philosopher than emperor: for his dominions were
greater within than without. And having commanded
his own passions by a circumspect conformity to virtuous
principles, he was fit to rule those of other men.
Take some of his excellent sayings, as followeth: "Of my
grandfather Verus I have learned to be gentle and meek,
and to refrain from all anger and passion. From the fame
and memory of him that begot me, shamefacedness, and
manlike behaviour. I observed his meekness, his constancy
without wavering, in those things, which, after a
due examination and deliberation, he had determined.
How free from all vanity he carried himself in matters of
honour and dignity! His laboriousness and assiduity:
his readiness to hear any man that had ought to say,
tending to any common good. His moderate condescending
to other men's occasions as an ordinary man.&mdash;Of my
mother, to be religious and bountiful, and to forbear not[252]
only to do, but to intend any evil. To content myself
with a spare diet, and to fly all such excess as is incident
to great wealth.&mdash;Of my grandfather, both to frequent
public schools and auditories, and to get me good and
able teachers at home; and that I ought not to think
much, if upon such occasions I were at excessive charge.
I gave over the study of rhetoric and poetry, and of
elegant, neat language. I did not use to walk about the
house in my senator's robe, nor to do any such things. I
learned to write letters without any affectation and curiosity;
and to be easy, and ready to be reconciled, and
well pleased again with them that had offended me, as
soon as any of them would be content to seek unto me
again. To observe carefully the several dispositions of my
friends, and not to be offended with idiots, nor unreasonably
to set upon those, that are carried away with the vulgar
opinions, with the theorems and tenets of philosophers.
To love truth and justice, and to be kind and loving to all
them of my house and family, I learned from my brother
Severus: and it was he that put me in the first conceit
and desire of an equal commonwealth, administered by
justice and equality; and of a kingdom, wherein should
be regarded nothing more than the good and welfare, or
liberty of the subjects. As for God, and such suggestions,
helps, and inspirations, as might be expected, nothing did
hinder, but that I might have begun long before to live
according to nature: or that even now, that I was not yet
partaker, and in present possession of that life, I myself
(in that I did not observe those inward motions and suggestions;
yea, and almost plain and apparent instructions
and admonitions of God) was the only cause of it.&mdash;I that
understand the nature of that which is good, that it is to
be desired; and of that which is bad, that it is odious and
shameful: who know moreover, that this transgressor,
whoever he be, is my kinsman, not by the same blood and[253]
seed, but by participation of the same reason, and of the
same divine participle, or principle: how can I either be
hurt by any of these, since it is not in their power to
make me incur anything that is reproachful, or be angry
or ill affected towards him, who by nature is so near unto
me? For we are all born to be fellow-workers, as the
feet, the hands, and the eyelids; as the rows of upper and
under teeth: for such therefore to be in opposition, is
against nature."&mdash;He saith, "It is high time for thee to
understand true nature, both of the world, whereof thou
art a part, and of that Lord and Governor of the world,
from whom, as a channel from the spring, thou thyself
didst flow. And that there is but a certain limit of time
appointed unto thee, which if thou shalt not make use of,
to calm and allay the many distempers of thy soul, it will
pass away, and thou with it, and never after return.&mdash;Do,
soul, do abuse and contemn thyself yet awhile, and the
time for thee to repent thyself will be at an end. Every
man's happiness depends upon himself; but, behold! thy
life is almost at an end, whilst not regarding thyself as
thou oughtest, thou dost make thy happiness to consist
in the souls and conceits of other men. Thou must also
take heed of another kind of wandering; for they are
idle in their actions who toil and labour in their life, and
have no certain scope to which to direct all their motions
and desires. As for life and death, honour and dishonour,
labour and pleasure, riches and poverty, all these things
happen unto men indeed, both good and bad equally; but
as things, which of themselves are neither good nor bad,
because of themselves neither shameful nor praiseworthy.
Consider the nature of all worldly visible things; of those
especially, which either ensnare by pleasure, or for their
irksomeness are dreadful; or for their outward lustre
and show, are in great esteem and request; how vile and
contemptible, how base and corruptible, how destitute of[254]
all true life and being they are. There is nothing more
wretched than that soul, which in a kind of circuit compasseth
all things; searching even the very depths of all the
earth, and, by all signs and conjectures, prying into the
very thoughts of other men's souls; and yet of this is not
sensible, that it is sufficient for a man to apply himself
wholly, and confine all his thoughts and cares to the
guidance of that Spirit which is within him, and truly and
really serve him. For even the least things ought not to
be done without relation unto the end; and the end of the
reasonable creature is, to follow and obey him who is the
reason, as it were, and the law of this great city, and most
ancient commonwealth. Philosophy doth consist in this,
for a man to preserve that spirit which is within him, from
all manner of contumelies and injuries, and above all
pains and pleasures, never to do anything either rashly,
or feignedly, or hypocritically: he that is such is surely
indeed a very priest and minister of God, well acquainted,
and in good correspondence with him especially, that is
seated and placed within himself; to whom also he keeps
and preserveth himself; neither spotted by pleasure, nor
daunted by pain; free from any manner of wrong or contumely.
Let thy God that is in thee, to rule over thee,
find by thee, that he hath to do with a man, an aged man,
a sociable man, a Roman, a prince, and that hath ordered
his life, as one that expecteth, as it were, nothing but the
sound of the trumpet, sounding a retreat to depart out of
this life with all readiness. Never esteem anything as
profitable, which shall ever constrain thee, either to
break thy faith, or to lose thy modesty: to hate any man,
to suspect, to curse, to dissemble, to lust after anything
that requireth the secret of walls or veils. But he that
preferreth, before all things, his rational part and spirit,
and the sacred mysteries of virtue which issue from it, he
shall never want either solitude or company; and, which[255]
is chiefest of all, he shall live without either desire or
fear. If thou shalt intend that which is present, following
the rule of right and reason carefully, solidly, meekly;
and shalt not intermix any other business, but shalt study
this, to preserve thy spirit unpolluted and pure: and as
one that were even now ready to give up the ghost; shalt
cleave unto him, without either hope or fear of anything,
in all things that thou shalt either do or speak, contenting
thyself with heroical truth, thou shalt live happily: and
from this there is no man that can hinder thee. Without
relation to God, thou shalt never perform aright anything
human; nor on the other side anything divine. At what
time soever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into
thyself, and to be at rest: for a man cannot retire any
whither to be more at rest, and freer from all business,
than into his own soul. Afford then thyself this retiring
continually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself. Death
hangeth over thee, whilst yet thou livest, and whilst thou
mayest be good. How much time and leisure doth he
gain, who is not curious to know what his neighbour hath
said, or hath done, or hath attempted, but only what he
doth himself, that it may be just and holy. Neither must
he use himself to cut off actions only, but thoughts and
imaginations also that are not necessary; for so will unnecessary
consequent actions the better be prevented and
cut off. He is poor that stands in need of another, and
hath not in himself all things needful for his life. Consider
well, whether magnanimity rather, and true liberty, and
true simplicity, and equanimity, and holiness, whether
these be not most reasonable and natural. Honour that
which is chiefest and most powerful in the world, and
that is it which makes use of all things, and governs all
things: so also in thyself, honour that which is chiefest
and most powerful, and is of one kind and nature with
that; for it is the very same, which being in thee, turneth[256]
all other things to its own use, and by whom also thy life
is governed. What is it that thou dost stay for? An
extinction or a translation; for either of them, with a
propitious and contented mind. But till that time come,
what will content thee? What else, but to worship and
praise God, and do good unto men?" As he lay dying,
and his friends about him, he spake thus: "Think more
of death, than of me, and that you and all men must die
as well as I." Adding, "I recommend my son to you, and
to God, if he be worthy."

VIII. Pertinax, also emperor, being advised to save himself
from the fury of the mutineers, answered "No: what
have I done that I should do so?" Showing that innocence
is bold, and should never give ground where it can
show itself, be heard, and have fair play.

IX. Pescennius seeing the corruption that reigned among
officers of justice, advised, "That judges should have first
salaries, that they might do their duty without any other
bribes or perquisites." He said, "He would not offend
the living that he might be praised when he was dead."

X. Alexander Severus having tasted both of a private
life, and the state of an emperor, had this censure; "Emperors,"
says he, "are ill managers of the public revenue
to feed so many unuseful mouths;" wherefore he retrenched
his family from pompous to serviceable. He
would not employ persons of quality in his domestic service,
thinking it too mean for them and too costly for him:
adding, "That personal service was the work of the lowest
order of the people." He would never suffer offices of
justice to be sold; "For," saith he, "it is not strange that
men should sell what they buy;" meaning justice. He
was impartial in correction: "My friends," says he, "are
dear to me; but the commonwealth is dearer." Yet he
would say, "That sweetening power to the people made it
lasting. That we ought to gain our enemies as we keep[257]
our friends:" that is, by kindness. He said, "That we
ought to desire happiness and to bear afflictions; that
those which are desirable may be pleasant; but the troubles
we avoid may have most profit in the end." He did not
like pomp in religion: for it is not gold that recommends
the sacrifice, but the piety of him that offers it. A house
being in contest betwixt some Christians and keepers of
taverns, the one to perform religion, the other to sell drink
therein, he decided the matter thus: "That it were
much better that it were any way employed to worship
God than to make a tavern of it." Behold! by this we
may see the wisdom and virtue that shined among the
heathens.

XI. Dioclesian would say, that there was nothing
more difficult than to reign well: and the reason he gave
was, that those who had the ears of princes do so continually
lay ambushes to surprise them to their interests, that
they can hardly make one right step.

XII. Theodosius the younger was so merciful in his
nature, that instead of putting people to death, he wished
it were in his power to call the dead to life again.

These were the sentiments of the ancient grandees of
the world, to wit, emperors, kings, princes, captains,
statesmen, &amp;c. not unworthy of the thoughts of persons of
the same figure and quality now in being: and for that
end they are here collected, that such may with more ease
and brevity behold the true statutes of the ancients, not
lost or lessened by the decays of time.


III. I will now proceed to report the virtuous doctrines
and sayings of men of more retirement; such as philosophers
and writers, both Greeks and Romans, who in
their respective times were masters in the civility, knowledge,
and virtue that were among the Gentiles, being
most of them many ages before the coming of Christ, viz.

[258]



1. Thales.&mdash;2. Pythagoras.&mdash;3. Solon.&mdash;4. Chilon.&mdash;5. Periander.&mdash;6.
Bias.&mdash;7. Cleobulus.&mdash;8. Pittacus.&mdash;9. Hippias.&mdash;10. The
Bambycatii.&mdash;11. The Gynæcosmi.&mdash;12. Anacharsis.&mdash;13. Anaxagoras.&mdash;14.
Heraclitus.&mdash;15. Democritus.&mdash;16. Socrates.&mdash;17.
Plato.&mdash;18. Antisthenes.&mdash;19. Xenocrates.&mdash;20. Bion.&mdash;21. Demonax.&mdash;22.
Diogenes.&mdash;23. Crates.&mdash;24. Aristotle.&mdash;25. Mandanis.&mdash;26.
Zeno.&mdash;27. Seneca.&mdash;28. Epictetus.

I. Thales, an ancient Greek philosopher, being asked
by a person that had committed adultery if he might
swear, answered, "By no means; for perjury is no less
sinful than adultery; and so thou wouldst commit two
sins to cover one." Being asked what was the best condition
of a government, answered, "That the people be
neither rich nor poor:" for he placed external happiness
in moderation. He would say, "That the hardest thing
in the world was to know a man's self; but the best to
avoid those things which we reprove in others;" an excellent
and close saying, "That we ought to choose well and
then to hold fast. That the felicity of the body consists
in health, and that in temperance; and the felicity of the
soul in wisdom." He thought "That God was without
beginning or end; that he was the searcher of hearts; that
he saw the thoughts as well as actions: for being asked
of one if he could sin and hide it from God, he answered,
'No: how can I when he who thinks evil cannot?'"

II. Pythagoras, a famous and virtuous philosopher of
Italy, being asked when men might take the pleasure of
their passions, answered, "When they have a mind to be
worse." He said the world was like a comedy, and the
true philosophers the spectators. He would say, "That
luxury led to debauchery, and debauchery to violence, and
that to bitter repentance: that he who taketh too much
care of his body makes the prison of his soul more insufferable:
that those who do reprove us are our best friends;
that men ought to preserve their bodies from diseases by
temperance, their souls from ignorance by meditation,[259]
their will from vice by self-denial, and their country from
civil war by justice: that it is better to be loved than
feared; that virtue makes bold: but," saith he, "there is
nothing so fearful as an evil conscience." He said, "That
men should believe in a Divinity, that he is, and that he
overlooks them, and neglecteth them not; there is no
being nor place without God." He told the senators of
Croton, being two thousand, praying his advice, "That
they received their country as a depositum, or trust from
the people; wherefore they should manage it accordingly,
since they were to resign their account, with their trust to
their children; that the way to do it was to be equal to
all citizens, and to excel them in nothing more than justice;
that every one of them should so govern his family
that he might refer himself to his own house as to a court
of judicature, taking great care to preserve natural affection;
that they be examples of temperance in their own
families, and to the city; that in courts of judicature none
attest God by an oath, but use themselves so to speak as
they may be believed without an oath: that the discourse
of that philosopher is vain, by which no passion of a man
is healed; for as there is no benefit of medicine if it expel
not diseases out of bodies, so neither of philosophy if it
expel not evil out of the soul."

III. Solon, esteemed as Thales, one of the seven sages
of Greece, a noble philosopher, and a lawgiver to the
Athenians, was so humble that he refused to be prince of
that people, and voluntarily banished himself when Pisastratus
usurped the government there;[5] resolving never to
outlive the laws and freedom of his country. He would
say, that to make a government last the magistrates must
obey the laws, and the people the magistrates. It was his
judgment, that riches brought luxury, and luxury brought
tyranny. Being asked by Cr&oelig;sus, king of Lydia, when[260]
seated on his throne richly clothed and magnificently
attended, if he had ever seen anything more glorious; he
answered, cocks, peacocks, and pheasants; by how much
their beauty is natural. These undervaluing expressions
of wise Solon, meeting so pat upon the pride and luxury
of Cr&oelig;sus, they parted; the one desirous of toys and
vanities, the other an example and instructor of true
nobility and virtue, that contemned the king's effeminacy.
Another time Cr&oelig;sus asked him who was the happiest
man in the world; expecting he would have said Cr&oelig;sus,[6]
because the most famous for wealth in those parts: he
answered, "Tellus, who, though poor, yet was an honest
and good man, and contented with what he had: who,
after he had served the commonwealth faithfully, and seen
his children and grandchildren virtuously educated, died
for his country in a good old age, and was carried by his
children to his grave." This much displeased Cr&oelig;sus,
but he dissembled it. Whilst Solon recommended the
happiness of Tellus, Cr&oelig;sus, moved, demanded to whom
he assigned the next place; making no question but himself
should be named, "Cleobis," saith he, "and Bito,
brethren that loved well, had a competency, were of great
health and strength; most tender and obedient to their
mother, religious of life, who after sacrificing in the
temple fell asleep and waked no more." Hereat Cr&oelig;sus
growing angry, "Strange!" saith he, "doth our happiness
seem so despicable that thou wilt not rank us equal with
private persons?" Solon answered, "Dost thou inquire
of us about human affairs? Knowest thou not that Divine
Providence is severe, and often full of alteration? Do
not we in process of time see many things we would
not? Aye, and suffer many things we would not?
Count man's life at seventy years, which makes[7] twenty-six
thousand two hundred and fifty and odd days, there is[261]
scarcely one day like another: so that every one, O
Cr&oelig;sus! is attended with crosses. Thou appearest to me
very rich, and king over many people; but the question
thou askest I cannot resolve till I hear thou hast ended
thy days happily: for he that hath much wealth is not
happier than he that gets his bread from day to day,
unless Providence continue those good things, and that he
dieth well. Solon, after his discourse, not flattering
Cr&oelig;sus, was dismissed, and accounted unwise that he
neglected the present good out of regard to the future.
Æsop, that wrote the fables, being then at Sardis, sent
for thither by Cr&oelig;sus, and much in favour with him, was
grieved to see Solon so unthankfully dismissed, and
said to him, "Solon, we must either tell kings nothing
at all or what may please them:" "No," saith Solon,
"either nothing at all, or what is best for them."
However it was not long ere Cr&oelig;sus was of another
mind; for being taken prisoner by Cyrus, the founder
of the Persian monarchy, and by his command fettered
and put on a pile of wood to be burned, Cr&oelig;sus sighed
deeply,[8] and cried, "O Solon! Solon!" Cyrus bid the
interpreter ask on whom he called. He was silent;
at last pressing him, answered, "Upon him who I desire
above all wealth, would have spoken with all tyrants."
This not understood, upon further importunity he told
them, "Solon, an Athenian, who long since," says he,
"came to me, and seeing my wealth, despised it; besides,
what he told me is come to pass; nor did his counsel
belong to me alone, but to all mankind, especially those
that think themselves happy." Whilst Cr&oelig;sus said thus,
the fire began to kindle and the outparts to be seized by
the flame: Cyrus, informed of the interpreters what
Cr&oelig;sus said, began to be troubled; and knowing himself
to be a man, and that to use another, not inferior to himself[262]
in wealth, so severely, might one day be retaliated,
instantly commanded the fire to be quenched, and Cr&oelig;sus
and his friends to be brought off: whom ever after, as long
as he lived, Cyrus had in great esteem. Thus Solon
gained due praise, that of two kings his advice saved one
and instructed the other. And as it was in Solon's time
that tragical plays were first invented, so he was most
severe against them; foreseeing the inconveniencies that
followed upon the people's being affected with the novelty
of pleasure. It is reported of him that he went himself to
the play, and after it was ended he went to Thespis, the
great actor, and asked him if he were not ashamed to tell
so many lies in the face of so great an auditory. Thespis
answered, as it is now usual, "There is no harm nor
shame to act such things in jest." Solon, striking his
staff hard upon the ground, replied, "But in a short time
we who approve of this kind of jest shall use it in earnest
in our common affairs and contracts." In fine, he absolutely
forbade him to teach or act plays, conceiving them
deceitful and unprofitable; diverting youth and tradesmen
from more necessary and virtuous employments. He
defined them happy who are competently furnished with
their outward callings,[9] that live temperately and honestly:
he would say that cities are the common sewer of wickedness.
He affirmed that to be the best family which got
not unjustly, kept not unfaithfully, spent not with repentance.
"Observe," saith he, "honesty in thy conversation
more strictly than an oath. Seal words with silence;
silence with opportunity. Never lie, but speak the truth.
Fly pleasure, for it brings sorrow. Advise not the people
what is most pleasant, but what is best. Make not friends
in haste, nor hastily part with them. Learn to obey, and
thou wilt know how to command. Be arrogant to none;
be mild to those about thee. Converse not with wicked[263]
persons. Meditate on serious things. Reverence thy
parents. Cherish thy friend. Conform to reason, and in
all things take counsel of God." In fine, his two short
sentences were these:[10] "Of nothing too much;" and
"Know thyself."

IV. Chilon, another of the wise men of Greece, would
say, that it was the perfection of a man, to foresee and
prevent mischiefs; that herein good people differ from
bad ones, their hopes were firm and assured; that God
was the great touchstone, or rule of mankind; that men's
tongues ought not to outrun their judgment: that we
ought not to flatter great men, lest we exalt them above
their merit and station; nor to speak hardly of the helpless.
They that would govern a state well, must govern their
families well. He would say, that a man ought so to
behave himself, that he fall neither into hatred nor disgrace.
That that commonwealth is happiest where the people
mind the law more than the lawyers. Men should not
forget the favours they receive, nor remember those they
do. Three things, he said, were difficult, yet necessary to
be observed: to keep secrets, forgive injuries, and use time
well. "Speak not ill," says he, "of thy neighbour. Go
slowly to the feast of thy friends, but swiftly to their
troubles. Speak well of the dead. Shun busybodies.
Prefer loss before covetous gain. Despise not the miserable.
If powerful, behave thyself mildly, that thou
mayst be loved rather than feared. Order thy house
well: bridle thy anger: grasp not at much: make not
haste, neither dote upon anything below. A prince,"
saith he, "must not take up his time about transitory and
mortal things; eternal and immortal are fittest for him."
To conclude: he was so just in all his actions, that Laertius
tells us, he professed in his old age, that he had never
done anything contrary to the conscience of an upright[264]
man; only, that of one thing he was doubtful, having
given sentence against his friend, according to law, he
advised his friend to appeal from him his judge, so to
preserve both his friend and the law. Thus true and
tender was conscience in heathen Chilon.

V. Periander, prince and philosopher too, would say,
that pleasures are mortal, but virtues immortal.[11] "In
success be moderate, in disappointments, patient and
prudent. Be alike to thy friends, in prosperity, and in
adversity. Peace is good; rashness dangerous; gain sordid.
Betray not secrets: punish the guilty: restrain men
from sin. They that would rule safely, must be guarded
by love, not arms. To conclude," saith he, "live worthy
of praise, so wilt thou die blessed."

VI. Bias, one of the seven wise men, being in a storm
with wicked men, who cried mightily to God; "Hold
your tongues,"[12] saith he, "it were better He knew not
you were here:" a saying that hath great doctrine in it;
the devotion of the wicked doth them no good: it answers
to that passage in Scripture, "The prayers of the wicked
are an abomination to the Lord." (Prov. xv. 8.) An ungodly
man asking him what godliness was, he was silent:
but the other murmuring, saith he, "What is that to thee,
that is not thy concern?" He was so tender in his
nature, that he seldom judged a criminal to death, but he
wept; adding, "One part goeth to God, and the other
part I must give the law." "That man is unhappy," saith
he, "that cannot bear affliction. It is a disease of the
mind, to desire that which cannot, or is not fit to be had.
It is an ill thing, not to be mindful of other men's miseries."
To one that asked what is hard, he answered,
"To bear cheerfully a change for the worse." "Those,"
says he, "who busy themselves in vain knowledge, resemble
owls that see by night, and are blind by day; for[265]
they are sharp-sighted in vanity, but dark at the approach
of true light and knowledge." He adds, "Undertake
deliberately; but then go through. Speak not hastily,
lest thou sin. Be neither silly nor subtle. Hear much;
speak little and seasonably. Make profession of God
everywhere; and impute the good thou dost, not to
thyself, but to the power of God." His country being
invaded, and the people flying with the best of their
goods, asked, why he carried none of his; "I," saith he,
"carry my goods within me."&mdash;Valerius Maximus adds,
"in his breast;" not to be seen by the eye, but to be prized
by the soul; not to be demolished by mortal hands; present
with them that stay, and not forsaking those that fly.

VII. Cleobulus, prince and philosopher of Lyndus:[13]
he would say, "That it was man's duty to be always employed
upon something that was good." Again, "Be never
vain nor ungrateful. Bestow your daughters, virgins in
years, but matrons in discretion. Do good to thy friend,
to keep him; to thy enemy, to gain him. When any man
goeth forth, let him consider what he hath to do; when
he returneth, examine what he hath done. Know, that to
reverence thy father is thy duty. Hear willingly, but
trust not hastily. Obtain by persuasion, not by violence.
Being rich, be not exalted: poor, be not dejected. Forego
enmity. Instruct thy children. Pray to God, and persevere
in godliness."

VIII. Pittacus being asked what was best, he answered,
"to do the present thing well."[14] He would say, what
thou dost take ill in thy neighbour, do not thyself.
Reproach not the unhappy; for the hand of God is upon
them. Be true to thy trust. Bear with thy neighbour:
love thy neighbour. Reproach not thy friend, though he
recede from thee a little. He would say that commonwealth[266]
is best ordered where the wicked have no command,
and that family, which hath neither ornament nor
necessity. To conclude: he advised to acquire honesty;
love discipline; observe temperance; gain prudence;
mind diligence; and keep truth, faith, and piety. He had
a brother, who, dying without issue, left him his estate;
so that when Cr&oelig;sus offered him wealth he answered, "I
have more by half than I desire." He also affirmed that
family the best who got not unjustly, kept not unfaithfully,
spent not with repentance; and that happiness consists in
a virtuous and honest life: in being content with a competency
of outward things, and in using them temperately.
And to conclude, he earnestly enjoined all to flee corporeal
pleasure; "for," says he, "it certainly brings sorrow:
but observe an honest life more strictly than an oath:
meditate on serious things."

IX. Hippias, a philosopher: it is recorded of him[15]
that he would have every one provide his own necessaries;
and, that he might do what he taught, he was his own
tradesman. He was singular in all such arts and employments,
insomuch as he made the very buskins he wore. A
better life than Alexander's.

X. The Bambycatii[16] were a certain great people that
inhabited about the river Tigris, in Asia, who, observing
the great influence gold, silver, and precious jewels had
upon their minds, agreed to bury all in the earth to prevent
the corruption of their manners.&mdash;They used inferior
metals, and lived with very ordinary accommodation;
wearing mostly but one very grave and plain robe to cover
nakedness. It were well if Christians would mortify their
insatiable appetites after wealth and vanity any way, for
heathens judge their excess.

XI. The Athenians had two distinct numbers of men,
called the Gynæcosmi and Gynæconomi.[17] These were[267]
appointed by the magistrates to overlook the actions of
the people: the first were to see that they apparelled and
behaved themselves gravely; especially that women were
of modest behaviour; and the other were to be present at
their treats and festivals, to see that there was no excess,
nor disorderly carriage; and in case any were found
criminal, they had full power to punish them. When,
alas! when shall this care and wisdom be seen amongst the
Christians of these times, that so intemperance might be
prevented? But it is too evident they love the power and
the profits, but despise the virtue of government, making
it an end instead of a means to that happy end, viz. the
well ordering the manners and conversation of the people,
and equally distributing rewards and punishments.

XII. Anacharsis, a Scythian, was a great philosopher;[18]
Cr&oelig;sus offered him large sums of money, but he refused
them. Hanno did the like, to whom he answered, "My
apparel is a Scythian rug; my shoes, the hardness of my
feet; my bed, the earth; my sauce, hunger: you may
come to me as one that is contented; but those gifts
which you so much esteem, bestow on your citizens."

XIII. Anaxagoras, a nobleman, but true philosopher,[19]
left his great patrimony to seek out wisdom; and being
reproved by his friends for the little care he had of his
estate, answered, "It is enough that you care for it." One
asked him why he had no more love for his country than
to leave it; "Wrong me not," saith he, "my greatest care
is my country," pointing his finger towards heaven. Returning
home, and taking a view of his great possessions,
"If I had not disregarded them," saith he, "I had
perished." He was a great clearer and improver of the
doctrine of One Eternal God, denying divinity to sun,
moon, and stars, saying, "God was infinite, not confined[268]
to place; the eternal wisdom and efficient cause of all
things; the divine mind and understanding; who, when
matter was confused, came and reduced it to order, which
is the world we see." He suffered much from some magistrates
for his opinion; yet dying, was admired by them.

XIV. Heraclitus was invited by king Darius, for his
great virtue and learning, to this effect: "Come as soon
as thou canst to my presence and royal palace; for the
Greeks, for the most part, are not obsequious to wise men,
but despise the good things which they deliver. With
me thou shalt have the first place, and daily honour and
titles: thy way of living shall be as noble as thy instructions."
But Heraclitus, refusing his offer, returned this
answer: "Heraclitus to Darius the king, health. Most
men refrain from justice and truth to pursue insatiableness
and vain glory, by reason of their folly: but I, having forgotten
all evil, and shunning the society of inbred envy
and pride, will never come to the kingdom of Persia,
being contented with a little according to my own mind."
He also slighted the Athenians. He had great and clear
apprehensions of the nature and power of God, maintaining
his divinity against the idolatry in fashion. This
definition he gives of God: "He is not made with hands.
The whole world, adorned with his creatures, is his mansion.
Where is God? Shut up in temples? Impious
men! who place their God in the dark. It is a reproach
to a man to tell him he is a stone, yet the god you profess
is born of a rock: you ignorant people! you know not
God: his works bear witness of him." Of himself he
saith, "O ye men, will ye not learn why I never laugh?
It is not that I hate men, but their wickedness. If you
would not have me weep, live in peace: you carry swords
in your tongues; you plunder wealth, poison friends,
betray the trust the people repose in you: shall I laugh
when I see men do these things? Their garments, beards,[269]
and heads adorned with unnecessary care; a mother deserted
by a wicked son; or young men consuming their patrimony;
others filling their bellies at feasts more with poison
than with dainties. Virtue would strike me blind if I should
laugh at your wars. By music, pipes, and stripes you are
excited to things contrary to all harmony. Iron, a metal
more proper for ploughs and tillage, is fitted for slaughter
and death; men raising armies of men, covet to kill one
another, and punish them that quit the field for not staying
to murder men. They honour as valiants such as are drunk
with blood; but lions, horses, eagles, and other creatures,
use not swords, bucklers, and instruments of war: their limbs
are their weapons,&mdash;some their horns, some their bills, some
their wings; to one is given swiftness, to another bigness,
to a third swimming. No irrational creature useth a sword,
but keeps itself within the laws of its creation, except
man, that doth not so, which brings the heavier blame,
because he hath the greatest understanding.&mdash;You must
leave your wars, and your wickedness, which you ratify
by a law, if you would have me leave my severity. I have
overcome pleasure, I have overcome riches, I have overcome
ambition, I have mastered flattery: fear hath nothing
to object against me, drunkenness hath nothing to charge
upon me, anger is afraid of me: I have won the garland
in fighting against these enemies."&mdash;This, and much more,
did he write in his epistles to Hermodorus, of his complaints
against the great degeneracy of the Ephesians.
And in an epistle to Aphidamus he writes, "I am fallen
sick, Aphidamus, of a dropsy; whatsoever is of us, if it
get the dominion, it becomes a disease. Excess of heat
is a fever; excess of cold, a palsy; excess of wind a
cholic: my disease cometh from excess of moisture. The
soul is something divine, which keeps all these in a due
proportion. I know the nature of the world; I know that
of man; I know diseases; I know health: but if my[270]
body be overpressed, it must descend to the place ordained;
however, my soul shall not descend; but being
a thing immortal, I shall ascend on high, where a heavenly
mansion shall receive me."

A most weighty and pathetical discourse: they that
know anything of God may savour something divine in it.
O that the degenerate Christians of these times would
but take a view of the virtue, temperance, zeal, piety, and
faith of this heathen, who notwithstanding that he lived
five hundred years before the coming of Christ in the
flesh, had these excellent sentences! Yet again, he taught
that God punisheth not by taking away riches; he rather
alloweth them to the wicked to discover them; for poverty
may be a veil. Speaking of God, "How can that light
which never sets be ever hidden or obscured?" "Justice,"
saith he, "shall seize one day upon defrauders and
witnesses of false things." Unless a man hope to the end for
that which is to be hoped for, he shall not find that which
is unsearchable; which Clemens, an ancient father, applied
to Isaiah vi. "Unless you believe, you shall not understand."
Heraclitus lived solitarily in the mountains;
had a sight of his end; and as he was prepared for it, so
he rejoiced in it. These certainly were the men who,
having not a law, without them, became a law unto themselves,
showing forth the work of the law written in their
hearts; (Rom. ii. 14;) and who for that reason shall
judge the circumcision, and receive the reward of "Well
done," by him who is Judge of quick and dead.

XV. Democritus would say, that he had lived to an extraordinary
age by keeping himself from luxury and
excess. That a little estate went a great way with men
that were neither covetous nor prodigal. That luxury
furnished great tables with variety: and temperance furnished
little ones. That riches do not consist in the
possession, but right use of wealth. He was a man of[271]
great retirement, avoiding public honours and employments;
bewailed by the people of Abdera as mad, whilst
indeed he only smiled at the madness of the world.

XVI. Socrates, the most religious and learned philosopher
of his time, and of whom it is reported Apollo gave
this character, that he was the wisest man on earth,[20] was
a man of a severe life, and instructed people gratis in just,
grave, and virtuous manners; for which, being envied by
Aristophanes, the vain, comical wit of that age, as one
spoiling the trade of plays, and exercising the generality
of the people with more noble and virtuous things,[21] was
represented by him in a play, in which he rendered
Socrates so ridiculous, that the vulgar would rather part
with Socrates in earnest than Socrates in jest; which
made way for their impeaching him as an enemy to their
gods; for which they put him to death. But in a short
space his eighty judges and the whole people so deeply
resented the loss, that they slew many of his accusers:
some hanged themselves; none would trade with them
nor answer them a question. They erected several statues
to his praise; they forbad his name to be mentioned, that
they might forget their injustice: they called home his
banished friends and scholars; and by the most wise and
learned men of that age it is observed, that famous city
Athens was punished with the most dreadful plagues that
ever raged amongst them, and all Greece with it never
prospered in any considerable undertaking, but from that
time always decayed. Amongst many of his sober and
religious maxims upon which he was accustomed to discourse
with his disciples, these are some:

He taught everywhere that an upright man and a
happy man are all one. They that do good are employed;[272]
they that spend their time in recreations are idle.[22] To do
good is the best course of life; he only is idle who might
be better employed. A horse is not known by his furniture,
but qualities; so men are to be esteemed for virtue,
not wealth. Being asked who lived without trouble, he
answered, "Those who are conscious to themselves of no
evil thing."[23] To one who demanded what was nobility,
he answered, "A good temper and disposition of soul and
body. They who know what they ought to do, and do it
not, are not wise and temperate, but fools and stupid."
To one that complained he had not been benefited by his
travels, "Not without reason," says Socrates, "thou didst
travel with thyself:" intimating, he knew not the eternal
mind of God to direct and inform him. Being demanded
what wisdom was, said, "A virtuous composure of the
soul." And being asked who were wise, answered,
"Those that sin not." Seeing a young man rich, but ignorant
of heavenly things, and pursuing earthly pleasures;
"Behold," says he, "a golden slave.[24] Soft ways of living
beget neither a good constitution of body nor mind. Fine
and rich clothes are only for comedians." Being demanded
from what things men and women ought to refrain, he
answered, "Pleasure." Being asked what continence and
temperance were, said, "Government of corporeal desires
and pleasures. The wicked live to eat, &amp;c. but the good
eat to live. Temperate persons become the most excellent:
eat that which neither hurts the body nor mind, and
which is easy to be gotten." One saying it was a great
matter to abstain from what one desires; "But," says he,
"it is better not to desire at all." This is deep religion,[273]
even very hard to professed Christians. "It is the property
of God to need nothing;[25] and they that need and
are contented with least come nearest to God. The only
and best way to worship God is to mind and obey
whatsoever he commands. That the souls of men and
women partake of the divine nature: that God is seen of
the virtuous mind: that by waiting upon him they are
united unto him in an accessible place of purity and happiness;
which God he asserted always to be near him."

Many more are the excellent sayings of this great man,
who was not less famous for his sayings than his example,
with the greatest nations; yet died he a sacrifice to the
sottish fury of the vain world. The history of his life
reports that his father was told[26] he should have the guide
of his life within him, which should be more to him than
five hundred masters; which proved true. Instructing his
scholars herein, charging them not to neglect these divine
affairs which chiefly concern man, to mind or inquire after
such things as are without in the visible world. He
taught the use of outward things[27] only as they were
necessary to life and commerce; forbidding superfluities
and curiosities. He was martyred for his doctrine, after
having lived seventy years, the most admired, followed,
and visited of all men in his time by kings and commonwealths;
and than whom antiquity mentions none with
more reverence and honour. Well were it for poor England
if her conceited Christians were true Socrateses;
whose strict, just, and self-denying life doth not bespeak
him more famous than it will Christians infamous at the
revelation of the righteous judgment, where heathens'
virtue shall aggravate Christians' intemperance; and their
humility, the others' excessive pride: and justly too, since[274]
a greater than Socrates is come, whose name they profess,
but they will not obey his law.

XVII. Plato, that famous philosopher and scholar to
Socrates,[28] was so grave and devoted to divine things,
nay, so discreetly politic, that in his commonwealth he
would not so much as harbour poetical fancies, much less
upon stages, as being too effeminate, and apt to withdraw
the minds of youth from more noble, more manly, as well
as more heavenly exercises. Plato seeing a young man
play at dice, reproved him sharply; the other answered,
"What, for so small a matter?" "Custom," saith Plato,
"is no small thing:[29] let idle hours be spent more usefully.
Let youth," said he, "take delight in good things;
for pleasures are the baits of evil. Observe, the momentary
sweetness of a delicious life is followed with eternal
sorrow; the short pain of the contrary, with eternal
pleasure." Being commanded to put on a purple garment
by the king of Sicily, he refused, saying he was a man,
and scorned such effeminacies. Inviting Timothy, the
Athenian general to supper, he treated him with herbs,
water, and such spare diet as he was accustomed to eat.
Timothy's friends next day, laughing, asked how he was
entertained, he answered,[30] "Never better in life; for he
slept all night after his supper:" thereby commending his
temperance. He addicted himself to religious contemplations:
and is said to have lived a virtuous and single
life, always eyeing and obeying the mind, which he
sometimes called, "God, the Father of all things;"
affirming, "Who lived so should become like him, and so be
related to, and joined with the Divinity itself." This same
Plato, upon his dying bed, sent for his friends about him,
and told them the whole world was out of the way, in that
they understood not, nor regarded the mind, assuring
them, those men died most comfortably that lived most[275]
conformably to right reason, and sought and adored the First
Cause, meaning God.

XVIII. Antisthenes, an Athenian philosopher,[31] had
taught in the study of eloquence several years; but upon
his hearing Socrates treat of the seriousness of religion,
of the divine life, eternal rewards, &amp;c. bid all his scholars
seek them a new master, for he had found one for himself:
wherefore selling his estate, he distributed it to the
poor, and betook himself wholly to the consideration of
heavenly things; going cheerfully six miles every day to
hear Socrates.&mdash;But where are the like preachers and
converts amongst the people called Christians? Observe
the daily pains of Socrates; surely he did not study a
week to read a written sermon; we are assured of the
contrary; for it was frequent with him to preach to the
people at any time of the day, in the very streets, as
occasion served, and his good genius moved him. Neither
was he a hireling, or covetous, for he did it gratis: surely
then he had not fat benefices, tithes, glebes, &amp;c. And let
the self-denial and diligence of Antisthenes be considered,
who of a philosopher and master became a scholar, and
that a daily one; surely, it was then matter of reproach,
as it is now; showing thereby both want of knowledge,
though called a philosopher, and his great desire to obtain
it of one that could teach him. None of these used to
go to plays, balls, treats, &amp;c. They found more serious
employments for their minds, and were examples of temperance
to the world.&mdash;I will repeat some of his grave
sentences, as reported by Laertius, and others; namely,
"That those are only noble, who are virtuous.[32] That
virtue was self-sufficient to happiness: that it consisteth
in actions, not requiring many words, nor much learning,
and is self-sufficient to wisdom: for that all other things
have reference thereunto. That men should not govern[276]
by force, nor by laws, unless good, but by justice."[33] To
a friend, complaining he had lost his notes, "Thou
shouldst have written them upon thy mind," saith he,
"and not in a book. Those who would never die, must
live justly and piously."&mdash;Being asked what learning was
best, "That," saith he, "which unlearneth evil."[34] To
one that praised a life full of pleasures and delicacies:[35]
"Let the sons of my enemies," saith he, "live delicately:"
counting it the greatest misery. "We ought," saith he,
"to aim at such pleasures as follow honest labour; and not
those which go before it."[36] When at any time he saw
a woman richly dressed, he would, in a way of reproach,
bid her husband bring out his horse and arms: meaning,
if he were prepared to justify the injuries such wantonness
used to produce, he might the better allow those
dangerous freedoms: "Otherwise," saith he, "pluck off
her rich and gaudy attire." He is said to exclaim bitterly
against pleasures; often saying, "I had rather be mad
than addicted to pleasure, and spend my days in decking
and feeding my carcase. Those," says he, "who have
once learned the way to temperance and virtue, let them
not offer to entangle themselves again with fruitless stories
and vain learning, nor be addicted to corporeal delicacies,
which dull the mind, and will divert and hinder them
from the pursuit of those more noble and heavenly virtues."
Upon the death of his beloved master, Socrates,[37] he
instituted a sect called Cynics, out of whom came the
great sect of Stoics; both which had these common principles,
which they daily, with great and unwearied diligence,
did maintain and instruct people in the knowledge
of, viz., "No man is wise and happy but the good and
virtuous man.[38] That not much learning nor study of[277]
many things was necessary. That a wise man is never
drunk nor mad: that he never sinneth; that a wise man
is void of passion: that he is sincere, religious, grave:
that he only is divine. That such only are priests and
prophets that have God in themselves. And that his law
is imprinted in their minds, and the minds of all men:[39]
that such an one only can pray who is innocent, meek,
temperate, ingenuous, noble, a good magistrate, father, son,
master, servant, and worthy of praise." On the contrary,
"that wicked men can be none of these: that the same
belongs to men and women."

Their diet was slender, their food only what would
satisfy nature.[40] Their garments exceeding mean. Their
habitations solitary and homely. They affirmed, those
who lived with fewest things and were contented, most
nearly approached God, who wants nothing. They voluntarily
despised riches, glory, and nobility, as foolish shows
and vain fictions, that had no true and solid worth or
happiness in them. They made all things to be good and
evil, and flatly denied the idle stories of fortune and
chance.

Certainly these were they who, having no external law,
became a law unto themselves, and did not abuse the
knowledge they had of the invisible God, but to their
capacities instructed men in the knowledge of that righteous,
serious, solid, and heavenly principle which leads
to true and everlasting happiness all those that embrace it.

XIX. Xenocrates refused Alexander's present,[41] yet
treated his ambassadors after his temperate and spare
manner, saying, "You see I have no need of your master's
bounty, that am so well pleased with this." He would[278]
say, "that one ought not to carry one's eyes or one's
hands into another man's house:" that is, to be a busy-body.
That one ought to be most circumspect of one's actions
before children, lest by example one's faults should outlive
one's self. He said pride was the greatest obstruction
to true knowledge. His chastity and integrity were
remarkable and reverenced in Athens: Phryne, the famous
Athenian courtezan, could not place a temptation upon
him, nor Philip, king of Macedon, a bribe, though the
rest sent in the embassy were corrupted. And being
once brought for a witness, the judges rose up, and cried
out, "Tender no oath to Xenocrates, for he will speak the
truth." A respect they did not allow to one another.
Holding his peace at some detracting discourse, they
asked him why he spoke not: "Because," saith he, "I
have sometimes repented of speaking, but never of holding
my peace."

XX. Bion would say, that great men walk in slippery
places: that it is a great mischief not to bear affliction;
that ungodliness is an enemy to assurance. He said to a
covetous man, that he did not possess his wealth, but his
wealth possessed him; abstaining from using it, as if it
were another man's. In fine, that men ought to pursue a
course of virtue, without regard to the praise or reproach
of men.

XXI. Demonax seeing the great care that men had of
their bodies, more than of their minds; "They deck the
house," saith he, "but slight the master." He would
say, that many are inquisitive after the make of the world,
but are little concerned about their own, which were a
science much more worthy of their pains. To a city that
would establish the gladiators, or prize-fighters, he said,
that they ought first to overthrow the altar of mercy;
intimating the cruelty of such practices. One asking
him why he turned philosopher; "Because," saith he,[279]
"I am a man." He would say of the priests of Greece,
if they could better instruct the people, they could not
give them too much; but if not, the people could not give
them too little. He lamented the unprofitableness of
good laws, by being in bad men's hands.

XXII. Diogenes was angry with critics that were nice
of words and not of their own actions; with musicians,
that tune their instruments but could not govern their
passions; with astrologers, that have their eyes in the
sky, and look not at their own goings; with orators, that
study to speak well but not to do well; with covetous
men, that take care to get but never use their estates;
with those philosophers that despise greatness, and yet
court great men; and with those that sacrifice for health,
and yet surfeit themselves with eating their sacrifices.
One time, discoursing of the nature, pleasure, and reward
of virtue, and the people not regarding what he said, he
fell a singing, at which every one pressed to hear;
whereupon he cried out, in abhorrence of their stupidity,
"O God, how much more is the world in love
with folly than with wisdom!" Seeing a man sprinkling
himself with water after having done some ill thing,
"Unhappy man," saith he, "dost thou not know that the
errors of life are not to be washed away with water?"
To one who said, "Life is an ill thing;" he answered,
"Life is not an ill thing, but an ill life is an ill thing."
He was very temperate, for his bed and his table he found
everywhere. One seeing him wash herbs, said, "If thou
hadst followed Dionysius, king of Sicily, thou wouldst
not have needed to have washed herbs;" he answered,
"If thou hadst washed herbs, thou needest not to have
followed Dionysius." He lighted a candle at noon, saying,
"I look for a man;" implying that the world was
darkened by vice, and men effeminated. To a luxurious
person, that had wasted his means, supping upon olives;[280]
"If," saith he, "thou hadst used to dine so, thou wouldst
not have needed to sup so." To a young man, dressing
himself neatly; "If this," saith he, "be for the sake of
men, thou art unhappy; if for women, thou art unjust."
Another time, seeing an effeminate young man; "Art
thou not ashamed," saith he, "to use thyself worse than
nature hath made thee? She hath made thee a man, but
thou wilt force thyself to be a woman." To one that
courted a bad woman; "O wretch!" said he, "what
meanest thou to ask for that which is better lost than
found?" To one that smelled of sweet unguents, "Have
a care," saith he, "that this perfume make not thy life stink."
He compared covetous men to such as have the dropsy;
those are full of money, yet desire more; these of water,
yet thirst for more. Being asked what beasts were the
worst; "In the field," saith he, "bears and lions; in the
city, usurers and flatterers." At a feast, one giving him a
great cup of wine, he threw it away: for which being
blamed, "If I had drunk it," saith he, "not only the wine
would have been lost, but I also." One asking him how
he might order himself best, he said, "By reproving those
things in thyself which thou blamest in others." Another
demanding what was the hardest, he answered, "To know
ourselves; to whom we are partial." An astrologer discoursing
to the people of the wandering stars; "No,"
saith he, "it is not the stars, but these," pointing to the
people that heard him. Being asked what men are most
noble; "They," saith he, "who contemn wealth, honour,
and pleasure, and endure the contraries, to wit, poverty,
scorn, pain, and death." To a wicked man, reproaching
him for his poverty; "I never knew," saith he, "a man
punished for his poverty, but many for their wickedness."
To one bewailing himself that he should not die in his
own country; "Be of comfort," saith he, "for the way to
heaven is alike in every place." One day he went backwards;[281]
whereat the people laughing, "Are you not
ashamed," saith he, "to do that all your lifetime, which
you deride in me?"

XXIII. Crates, a Theban, famous for his self-denial
and virtue, descended from the house of Alexander, of
great estate, at least two hundred talents, which having
mostly distributed amongst the poor citizens, he became
a constant professor of the Cynic philosophy. He exceedingly
inveighed against common women. Seeing at
Delphos a golden image, that Phryne, the courtezan, had
set up by the gains of her trade, he cried out, "This is a
trophy of the Greeks' intemperance." Seeing a young
man highly fed and fat: "Unhappy youth," said he, "do
not fortify thy prison." To another, followed by a great
many parasites; "Young man," saith he, "I am sorry to
see thee so much alone." Walking one day upon the
Exchange, where he beheld people mighty busy after
their divers callings; "These people," saith he, "think
themselves happy; but I am happy that have nothing to
do with them; for I place my happiness in poverty, not
in riches. Oh! men do not know how much a wallet, a
measure of lupins, with security, is worth." Of his wife,
Hipparchia, a woman of wealth and extraction, but
nobler for her love to true philosophy, and how they came
together, there will be occasion to make mention in its
place.

XXIV. Aristotle, a scholar to Plato,[42] and the oracle of
philosophy to these very times, though not so divinely
contemplative as his master, nevertheless follows him in
this, "That luxury should by good discipline be exiled
human societies."[43] Aristotle seeing a youth finely dressed,
said, "Art thou not ashamed, when nature hath made
thee a man, to make thyself a woman?"[44] And to
another, gazing on his fine cloak; "Why dost thou boast[282]
thyself of a sheep's fleece?" He said it was the duty of
a good man to live so under laws as he should do if there
were none.

XXV. Mandanis, a great and famous philosopher of the
Gymnosophists, whom Alexander the Great required to
come to the feast of Jupiter's son, (meaning himself,) declaring,
that if he came he should be rewarded, if not, he
should be put to death; the philosopher contemned his
message as vain and sordid: he first told them, that he
denied him to be Jupiter's son; a mere fiction. Next,
that as for his gifts, he esteemed them nothing worth;
his own country could furnish him with necessaries;
beyond which he coveted nothing. And lastly, as for the
death he threatened, he did not fear it; but of the two, he
wished it rather, "In that," saith he, "I am sure it is a
change to a more blessed and happy state."

XXVI. Zeno, the great Stoic,[45] and author of that philosophy,
had many things admirable in him; who not
only said, but practised. He was a man of that integrity,
and so reverenced for it by the Athenians, that they deposited
the keys of the city in his hands, as the only person
fit to be entrusted with their liberties; yet by birth a
stranger, being of Citium in Cyprus. Antigonus, king of
Macedonia, had a great respect for him, and desired his
company, as the following letter expresseth:

"King Antigonus to Zeno the philosopher, health: I
think that I exceed thee in fortune and glory; but in
learning and discipline, and that perfect felicity which
thou hast attained, I am exceeded by thee; wherefore I
thought it expedient to write to thee, that thou wilt come
to me, assuring myself thou wilt not deny it. Use all
means therefore to come to us, and know, thou art not
to instruct me only, but all the Macedonians; for he who
teacheth the king of Macedonia, and guideth him to[283]
virtue, it is evident that he doth likewise instruct all his
subjects in virtue; for such as is the prince, such for the
most part are those who live under his government."

Zeno answered thus: "To king Antigonus, Zeno wisheth
health: I much esteem thy earnest desire of learning, in
that thou aimest at philosophy; not popular, which perverteth
manners, but that true discipline which conferreth
profit; avoiding that generally commended pleasure, which
effeminates the souls of men. It is manifest that thou art
inclined to generous things, not only by nature but by
choice; with indifferent exercise and assistance, thou
mayest easily attain to virtue. But I am very infirm of
body, being fourscore years of age, and so not well able to
come; yet I will send thee some of my chief disciples,
who in those things concerning the soul, are nothing inferior
to me; and whose instructions, if thou wilt follow
them, will conduct thee to perfect blessedness."

Thus Zeno refused Antigonus, but sent Persæus, his
countryman, and Philonides, a Theban. He would say,
that nothing was more unseemly than pride, especially in
youth, which was a time of learning. He therefore recommended
to young men modesty in three things; in
their walking, in their behaviour, and in their apparel: often
repeating those verses of Euripides, in honour of Capaneus:


 
  
    "He was not puff'd up with his store,
    Nor thought himself above the poor."
  
 

Seeing a man very finely dressed, stepping lightly over
a kennel: "That man," saith he, "doth not care for the
dirt, because he could not see his face in it." He also
taught, that people should not affect delicacy of diet, no,
not in their sickness. To one that smelt with unguents;
"Who is it," saith he, "that smells so effeminately?"
Seeing a friend of his taken too much up with the business
of his land; "Unless thou lose thy land," saith he,[284]
"thy land will lose thee." Being demanded, whether a
man that doth wrong may conceal it from God: "No,"
saith he, "nor yet he who thinks it;" which testifies to
the omnipresence of God. Being asked, who was his
best friend, he answered: "My other self;" intimating
the divine part that was in him. He would say, the end
of man was not to live, eat, and drink; but to use his life
so as to obtain a happy life hereafter. He was so humble
that he conversed with mean and ragged persons: whence
Timon thus:


 
  
    "And for companions, gets of servants store,
    Of all men the most empty and most poor."
  
 

He was patient, and frugal in his household expenses;
Laertius saith, he had but one servant; Seneca avers he
had none. He was mean in his clothes: in his diet, by
Philemon thus described:

 
  
    "He water drinks, then broth and herbs doth eat;
    teTeaching his scholars, almost without meat."xt
  
 

His chastity was so eminent, that it became a proverb;
"As chaste as Zeno." When the news of his death came
to Antigonus, he broke forth into these words, "What an
object have I lost!" And being asked, why he admired
him so much? "Because," saith he, "though I bestowed
many great things upon him, he was never therewith
exalted nor dejected." The Athenians, after his death, by
a public decree, erected a statue to his memorial; it runs
thus: "Whereas Zeno, the son of Mnaseas, a Cittian, has
professed philosophy about fifty-eight years in this city,
and in all things performed the office of a good man,
encouraging those young men who applied themselves to
him, to the love of virtue and temperance, leading himself
a life suitable to the doctrine which he professed; a
pattern to the best to imitate: the people have thought[285]
fit to do honour to Zeno, and to crown him with a crown
of gold, according to law, in regard of his virtue and
temperance, and to build a tomb for him, publicly, in the
Ceramick, &amp;c." These two were his epitaphs, one by
Antipater:


 
  
    "Here Zeno lies, who tall Olympus scal'd;
    Not heaping Pelion on Ossa's head;
    Nor by Herculean labours so prevailed;
    But found out virtue's paths, which thither led."
  
 

The other by Xenodotus, the Stoic, thus:

 
  
    "Zeno, thy years to hoary age were spent,
    Not with vain riches, but with self-content."
  
 

XXVII. Seneca, a great and excellent philosopher, who
with Epictetus shall conclude the testimonies of the men
of their character, hath so much to our purpose that his
works are but a kind of continued evidence for us: he
saith, "Nature was not so much an enemy, as to give an
easy passage of life to all other creatures, and that man
alone should not live without so many arts; she hath
commanded us none of these things. We have made all
things difficult to us, by disdaining things that are easy:
houses, clothes, meats, and nourishment of bodies, and
those things which are now the care of life, were easy to
come by, freely gotten, and prepared with a light labour:
for the measure of these things was necessity, not voluptuousness:
but we have made them pernicious and admirable:
they must be sought with art and skill. Nature
sufficeth to that which she requireth.

"Appetite hath revolted from nature, which continually
inciteth itself, and increaseth with the ages, helping vice
by wit. First it began to desire superfluous, then contrary
things: last of all, it sold the mind to the body, and
commanded it to serve the lusts thereof. All these arts,
wherewith the city is continually set at work, and maketh[286]
such a stir, do center in the affairs of the body, to which
all things were once performed as to a servant, but now
are provided as for a lord: hence the shops of engravers,
perfumers, &amp;c. Hence, of those that teach effeminate
motions of the body, and vain and wanton songs: for
natural behaviour is despised, which completed desires
with necessary help; now it is clownishness and ill-breeding
to be contented with as much as is requisite. What
shall I speak of rich marbles curiously wrought, wherewith
temples and houses do shine? What of stately
galleries and rich furniture? these are but the devices of
most vile slaves; the inventions of men, not of wise men:
for wisdom sits deeper; it is the mistress of the mind.
Wilt thou know what things she hath found out, what she
hath made? Not unseemly motions of the body, nor
variable singing by trumpet or flute; nor yet weapons of
wars, or fortifications: she endeavoureth profitable things;
she favours peace, and calls all mankind to agreement:
she leadeth to a blessed estate; she openeth the way to it,
and shows what is evil from what is good, and chaseth
vanity out of the mind. She giveth solid greatness, but
debaseth that which is puffed up, and would be seen of
men: she bringeth forth the image of God to be seen in
the souls of men: and so from corporeal, she translateth
into incorporeal things." Thus in the 90th epistle to Luculius.
To Gallio, he writeth thus: "All men, brother Gallio,
are desirous to live happy, yet blind to the means of that
blessedness. As long as we wander hither and thither,
and follow not our guide, but the dissonant clamour of
those that call on us to undertake different ways, our
short life is wearied and worn away amongst errors,
although we labour to get us a good mind: there is
nothing therefore to be more avoided, than following the
multitude without examination, and believing anything
without judging. Let us inquire, what is best done, not[287]
what is more usually done; and what planted us in the
possession of eternal felicity; not what is ordinarily allowed
of by the multitude, which is the worst interpreter
of truth. I call the multitude, as well those that are
clothed in white, as those in other colours: for I examine
not the colours of the garments, wherewith their bodies
are clothed: I trust not mine eyes to inform me what a
man is; I have a better and truer light, whereby I can
distinguish truth from falsehood. Let the soul find out
the good of the soul; if once she may have leisure to
withdraw into herself, Oh! how will she confess, I wish
all I have done were undone; and all I have said, when I
recollect it, I am ashamed of it, when I now hear the like in
others. These things below, whereat we gaze, and whereat
we stay, and which one man with admiration shows unto
another, do outwardly shine, but are inwardly empty. Let
us seek out somewhat that is good, not in appearance, but
solid, united, and best, in that which least appears: let us
discover this. Neither is it far from us: we shall find it
if we seek it. For it is wisdom not to wander from that
immortal nature, but to form ourselves according to his
law and example. Blessed is the man who judgeth
rightly: blessed is he who is contented with his present
condition: and blessed is he who giveth ear to that
immortal principle, in the government of his life." A
whole volume of these excellent things hath he written.
No wonder a man of his doctrine and life escaped not
the cruelty of brutish Nero, under whom he suffered
death; as also did the apostle Paul, with whom, it is said
Seneca had conversed. When Nero's messenger brought
him the news, that he was to die; with a composed and
undaunted countenance he received the errand, and presently
called for pen, ink, and paper, to write his last
will and testament; which the captain refusing, he turned
towards his friends, and took his leave thus: "Since, my[288]
loving friends, I cannot bequeath you any other thing in
acknowledgment of what I owe you, I leave you at least
the richest and best portion I have, that is the image of
my manners and life, which doing, you will obtain true
happiness." His friends showing great trouble for the loss
of him; "Where," saith he, "are those memorable precepts
of philosophy? And what is become of those provisions,
which for so many years together we have laid up
against the brunts and afflictions of Providence? Was
Nero's cruelty unknown to us? What could we expect
better at his hands, that killed his brother and murdered
his mother, but that he would put also his tutor and
governor to death?" Then turning to his wife Pompeia
Paulina, a Roman lady, young and noble, besought her for
the love she bore him and his philosophy, to suffer patiently
his affliction: "For," saith he, "my hour is come
wherein I must show, not only by discourse but by death,
the fruit I have reaped by my meditations; I embrace it
without grief, wherefore do not dishonour it with thy
tears. Assuage thy sorrow, and comfort thyself in the
knowledge thou hast had of me, and of my actions; and
lead the rest of thy life with that honest industry thou
hast addicted thyself unto." And dedicating his life to
God, he expired.

XXVIII. Epictetus, contemporary with Seneca, and an
excellent man, thought no man worthy of the profession
of philosophy, that was not purified from the errors of his
nature. His morals were very excellent, which he comprised
under these two words, sustaining, and abstaining;
or bearing, and forbearing; to avoid evil, and patiently
to suffer afflictions, which do certainly comprise the christian
doctrine and life, and is the perfection of the best
philosophy that was at any time taught by Egyptians,
Greeks, or Romans, when it signified virtue, self-denial,
and a life of religious solitude and contemplation.

[289]

How little the Christians of the times are true philosophers,
and how much more these philosophers were Christians,
than they, let the righteous principle in every conscience
judge. But is it not then intolerable, that they
should be esteemed Christians, who are yet to learn to
be good Heathens? That prate of grace and nature, and
know neither? Who will presume to determine what is
become of Heathens, and know not where they are themselves,
nor mind what may become of them? That can run
readily over a tedious list of famous personages, and calumniate
such as will not, with them, celebrate their memories
with extravagant and superfluous praises, whilst they
make it laudable to act the contrary: and none so ready
a way to become vile, as not to be vicious? A strange
paradox, but too true; so blind, so stupified, so besotted,
are the foolish sensualists of the world, under their great
pretences to religion, faith, and worship. Ah! did they
but know the peace, the joy, the unspeakable ravishments
of soul, that inseparably attend the innocent, harmless,
still, and retired life of Jesus? Did they but weigh within
themselves, the authors of their vain delights and pastimes,
the nature and disposition they are so grateful to, the dangerous
consequence of exercising the mind and its affections
below, and arresting and taking them up from their
due attendance and obedience to the most holy voice
crying in their consciences, "Repent, return, all is vanity,
and vexation of spirit:" were but these things reflected
upon; were the incessant wooings of Jesus, and his importunate
knocks and entreaties, by his light and grace, at
the door of their hearts, but kindly answered, and He admitted
to take up his abode there: and lastly, were such
resolved to give up to the instructions and holy guidance
of his eternal Spirit, in all the humble, heavenly, and righteous
conversation it requires, and of which He is become
our Captain and example; then, O then, both root and[290]
branch of vanity, the nature that invented, and that which
delights herself therein, with all the follies themselves,
would be consumed and vanish. But they, alas! cheat
themselves by misconstrued Scriptures, and daub with the
untempered mortar of misapplied promises. They will
be saints whilst they are sinners; and in Christ, whilst in
the spirit of the world, walking after the flesh, and not
after the Spirit, by which the true children of God are
led. My friends, mind the just witness and holy principle
in yourselves, that you may experimentally know more of
the Divine life, in which, and not in a multitude of vain
repetitions, true and solid felicity eternally consists.

IV. Nor is this reputation, wisdom, and virtue, only to
be attributed to men: there were women also in the
Greek and Roman ages, that honoured their sex, by great
examples of meekness, prudence, and chastity; and
which I do the rather mention, that the honour, story
yields to their virtuous conduct, may raise an allowable
emulation in those of their own sex, at least, to equal
the noble character given them by antiquity, viz.



1. Penelope.&mdash;2. Hipparchia.&mdash;3. Cornelia.&mdash;4. Pompeia Plautina.&mdash;5.
Plotina.&mdash;6. A reproof to voluptuous women of the times.

I. Penelope, wife to Ulysses, a woman eminent for her
beauty and quality, but more for her singular chastity.
Her husband was absent from her twenty years, partly in
the service of his country, and partly in exile; and being
believed to be dead, she was earnestly sought by divers
lovers, and pressed by her parents to change her condition;
but all the importunities of the one, or persuasions
of the other, not prevailing, her lovers seemed to use a
kind of violence, that where they could not entice, they
would compel: to which she yielded, upon this condition,
that they would not press her to marry, till she had[291]
ended the work she had in hand: which they granting,
"she undid by night what she wrought by day;" and
with that honest device she delayed their desire, till her
husband returned, whom she received, though in beggar's
clothes, with a heart full of love and truth. A constancy
that reproaches too many of the women of the times. Her
work shows the industry and employment, even of the
women of great quality in those times; whilst those of
the present age despise such honest labour as mean and
mechanical.

II. Hipparchia, a fair Macedonian virgin, noble of
blood, as they term it, but more truly noble of mind, I
cannot omit to mention: who entertained so earnest an
affection for Crates, the Cynical philosopher, as well for
his severe life as excellent discourse, that by no means
could her relations, nor suitors, by all their wealth, nobility,
and beauty, dissuade her from being his companion. Upon
which strange resolution, they all betook themselves to
Crates, beseeching him to show himself a true philosopher,
in persuading her to desist: which he strongly endeavoured
by many arguments; but not prevailing, went his
way, and brought all the little furniture of his house, and
showed her: "This," saith he, "is thy husband; that,
the furniture of thy house: consider on it, for thou canst
not be mine, unless thou followest the same course of
life:" for being rich above twenty talents, which is more
than £50,000, he neglected all to follow a retired life: all
which had so contrary an effect, that she immediately
went to him, before them all, and said, "I seek not the pomp
and effeminacy of this world, but knowledge and virtue,
Crates; and choose a life of temperance, before a life of
delicacies; for true satisfaction, thou knowest, is in the
mind; and that pleasure is only worth seeking, that lasts
for ever." Thus was it she became the constant companion
both of his love and life, his friendship and his virtues;[292]
travelling with him from place to place, and performing
the public exercises of instruction with Crates, wherever
they came. She was a most violent enemy to all impiety,
but especially to wanton men and women, and those whose
garb and conversation showed them devoted to vain pleasures
and pastimes; effeminacy rendering the like persons
not only unprofitable, but pernicious to the whole world.
Which she as well made good by the example of her
exceeding industry, temperance, and severity, as those are
wont to do by their intemperance and folly: for ruin of
health, estates, virtue, and loss of eternal happiness, have
ever attended, and ever will attend, such earthly minds.

III. Cornelia, also a noble Roman matron, and sister to
Scipio, was esteemed the most famous and honourable
personage of her time, not more for the greatness of her
birth, than her exceeding temperance. And history particularly
mentions this, as one great instance of her virtue,
for which she was so much admired, to wit, that she
never was accustomed to wear rich apparel, but such
apparel as was very plain and grave; rather making her
children, whom her instructions and example had made
virtuous, her greatest ornament: a good pattern for the
vain and wanton dames of the age.

IV. Pompeia Plautina, wife to Julianus the emperor,
commended for her compassion to the poor, used the power
her virtue had given her with her husband, to put him
upon all the just and tender things that became his charge,
and to dissuade him from whatsoever seemed harsh to the
people: particularly she diverted him from a great tax his
flatterers advised him to lay upon the people.

V. Plotina, the wife of Trajan, "a woman," saith a certain
author, "adorned with piety, chastity, and all the virtues
that a woman is capable of." There are two instances;
one of her piety, the other of her chastity; the first is
this: when her husband was proclaimed emperor, she[293]
mounted the capitol after the choice, where, in a religious
manner, she said, "Oh, that I may live under all this
honour, with the same virtue and content, that I enjoyed
before I had it." The second is this: her husband being
once exiled, she caused her hair to be cut short, as the
men wore it, that with less notice and danger she might
be the companion of his banishment.

VI. Thus may the voluptuous women of the times read
their reproof in the character of a brave Heathen, and
learn, that solid happiness consists in a neglect of wealth
and greatness, and a contempt of all corporeal pleasures,
as more befitting beasts than immortal spirits: and which
are loved by none but such, as not knowing the excellency
of heavenly things, are both inventing and delighting, like
brutes, in that which perisheth: giving the preference to
poor mortality, and spending their lives to gratify the lusts
of a little dirty flesh and blood, that shall never enter
into the kingdom of heaven; by all which their minds
become darkened, and so insensible of more celestial glories,
that they do not only refuse to inquire after them, but infamously
scoff and despise those that do, as a foolish and
mad people: to that strange degree of darkness and impudence
this age has got. But if the exceeding temperance,
chastity, virtue, industry, and contentedness of very Heathens,
with the plain and necessary enjoyments God has
been pleased to vouchsafe to the sons and daughters of
men, as sufficient to their wants and conveniency, that
they may be the more at leisure to answer the great end
of their being born, will not suffice, but that they will
exceed the bounds, precepts, and examples, both of Heathens
and Christians; anguish and tribulation will overtake
them, when they shall have an eternity to think upon,
with gnashing teeth, what to all eternity they can never
remedy; these dismal wages are decreed for them, who so
far affront God, heaven, and eternal felicity, as to neglect[294]
their salvation from sin here and wrath to come, for the
enjoyment of a few fading pleasures. For such to think,
notwithstanding their lives of sense and pleasure, wherein
their minds become slaves to their bodies, that they shall
be everlastingly happy, is an addition to their evils: since
it is a great abuse to the holy God, that men and women
should believe Him an eternal companion for their carnal
and sensual minds: for "As the tree falls, so it lies; and
as death leaves men, judgment finds them;" and there is
no repentance in the grave. Therefore, I beseech you, to
whom this comes, to retire: withdraw a while: let not the
body see all, taste all, enjoy all; but let the soul see too,
taste and enjoy those heavenly comforts and refreshments
proper to that eternal world, of which she is an inhabitant,
and where she must ever abide in a state of peace or
plagues, when this visible one shall be dissolved.

Having abundantly shown how much the doctrine and
the conversation of the virtuous Gentiles condemn the
pride, avarice, and luxury of the professed Christians of
the times; I shall, in the next place, to discharge my engagement,
and farther fortify this discourse, present my
reader with the judgment and practice of the most christian
times; as also of eminent writers, both ancient and
modern. I shall begin with the blessed Author of that
religion.

I. Jesus Christ, in whose mouth there was found no
guile, sent from God, with a testimony of love to mankind,[296]
and who laid down his life for their salvation; whom God
hath raised by his mighty power to be Lord of all, is
of right to be first heard in this matter; for never man
spake like him to our point; shot, clear, and close; and all
opposite to the way of this wicked world. "Blessed,"
says he, "are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
of God:" (Mat. v.:) He doth not say, blessed are the
proud, the rich, the high-minded: here is humility and
the fear of the Lord blest. "Blessed are they that mourn,
for they shall be comforted:" He doth not say, blessed are
the feasters, dancers, and revellers of the world, whose life
is swallowed up of pleasure and jollity: no; as He was a
man of sorrows, so He blest the godly sorrowful. "Blessed
are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth:" He doth not
say, blessed are the ambitious, the angry, and those that are
puffed up: He makes not the earth a blessing to them: and
though they get it by conquest and rapine, it will at last
fall into the hands of the weak to inherit. Again, "Blessed
are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:"
but no blessing to the hunger and thirst of the luxurious
man. "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain
mercy:" He draws men to tenderness and forgiveness by
reward. Hast thou one in thy power that hath wronged
thee? Be not rigorous; exact not the utmost farthing;
be merciful, and pity the afflicted, for such are blessed.
Yet further, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God." He doth not say, blessed are the proud, the
covetous, the unclean, the voluptuous, the malicious: no;
such shall never see God. Again, "Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they shall be called the children of God." He
doth not say, blessed are the contentious, back-biters, tale-bearers,
brawlers, fighters, makers of war; neither shall
they be called the children of God, whatever they may
call themselves. Lastly, "Blessed are ye when men shall
revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil[297]
against you, falsely for my sake: rejoice and be exceeding
glad, for great is your reward in heaven." He blesseth
the troubles of his people, and translates earthly sufferings
into heavenly rewards. He doth not say, blessed are you
when the world speaks well of you, and fawns upon you:
so that his blessings cross the world's. For the world
blesseth those as happy, that have the world's favour;
He blesseth those as happy that have the world's frowns.
This solveth the great objection, Why are you so foolish
to expose yourselves to the law, to incur the displeasure
of magistrates, and suffer the loss of your estates and liberties?
Cannot a man serve God in his heart, and do as
others do? Are you wiser than your forefathers? Call
to mind your ancestors. Will you question their salvation
by your novelties, and forget the future good of your wife
and children, as well as sacrifice the present comforts of
your life, to hold up the credit of a party? A language I
have more than once heard: I say, this doctrine of Christ
is an answer and antidote against the power of this objection.
He teaches us to embrace truth under all those
scandals. The Jews had more to say of this kind than
any, whose way had a more extraordinary institution;
but Christ minds not either institution or succession. He
was a new man, and came to consecrate a new way, and
that in the will of God; and the power that accompanied
his ministry, and that of his followers, abundantly proved
the Divine authority of his mission, who thereby warns
his to expect and to bear contradiction, reviling, and persecution:
for if they did it to the green tree, much more
were they to expect that they would do it to the dry; if
to the Lord, then to the servant.

Why then should Christians fear that reproach and tribulation,
that are the companions of his religion, since
they work to his sincere followers a far more exceeding
and eternal weight of glory? But indeed they have great[298]
cause to fear and be ashamed, who are the authors of such
reproach and suffering, so contrary to the meek and merciful
spirit of Christ: for if they are blessed, who are
reviled and persecuted for his sake, the revilers and persecutors
must be cursed. But this is not all: He bids his
disciples follow Him, learn of Him, for He was meek and
lowly: He taught them to bear injuries, and not smite
again; to exceed in kindness: to go two miles when
asked to go one; to part with cloak and coat too; to give
to them that ask, and to lend to them that would borrow;
to forgive, aye, and love enemies too; commanding them,
saying, "Bless them that curse you; do good to them
that hate you; and pray for them which despitefully use
you, and persecute you." (Mat. v.) Urging them with a
most sensible demonstration, "That," saith He, "ye may
be the children of your Father, which is in heaven: for He
maketh his sun to rise upon the good and the evil, and
his rain to descend upon the just and the unjust. He also
taught his disciples to believe and rely upon God's providence,
from the care that He had over the least of his creatures:
"Therefore," saith He, "I say unto you, take no
thought for your life, what ye shall eat, and what ye shall
drink, nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on: is
not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do
they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father
feedeth them; are ye not much better than they? Which
of you, by taking thought, can add one cubit unto his
stature? And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider
the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not,
neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that even
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which
to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall He not
much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore[299]
take no thought, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall
we drink, or wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after
all these things do the Gentiles seek, for your heavenly
Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But
seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,
and all these things shall be added unto you. Take therefore
no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take
thought for the things of itself: sufficient unto the day is
the evil thereof." (Mat. vi.) Oh! how plain, how sweet,
how full, yet how brief are his blessed sentences! They
thereby show from whence they came, and that Divinity
itself spoke them: what are laboured, what are forced and
scattered in the best of other writers, and not all neither,
is here comprised after a natural, easy, and conspicuous
manner. He sets nature above art, and trust above care.
This is He that himself came poor into the world, and so
lived in it: He lay in a manger, conversed with mechanics;
fasted much, retired often: and when He feasted, it
was with barley loaves and fish, dressed doubtless in an
easy and homely manner. He was solitary in his life, in
his death ignominious. The foxes had holes, the birds of
the air had nests, but the Son of Man had not a place
whereon to lay his head. He that made all things as
God, had nothing as man; which hath this blessed instruction
in it, that the meanest and poorest should not be
dejected, nor yet the richest and highest be exalted. In
fine, having taught this doctrine, and lived as He spoke,
He died to confirm it, and offered up Himself a propitiation
for the sins of the whole world, when no other sacrifice
could be found, that could atone for man with God, who,
rising above the power of death and the grave, hath led
captivity captive, and is become the first-born from the
dead, and Lord of the living; and his living people praise
Him, who is worthy for ever.

II. John the Baptist, who was the fore-runner of Christ's[300]
appearance in the flesh, did by his own abstinence sufficiently
declare what sort of person it was he came to
prepare and bespeak people to receive. For, though
sanctified from his birth and declared by Christ to be the
greatest of all prophets; yet his clothing was but a coarse
garment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle; and his
food, only locusts and wild honey: a life very natural, and
of great simplicity. This was all the pomp and retinue,
which the greatest ambassador that ever came to the world
was attended with; about the best of messages, to wit,
Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand: and, there is
one coming after me, whose shoes-latchet I am not worthy
to unloose, who shall baptize you with fire, and with the
Holy Ghost; and is the Lamb of God that taketh away
the sin of the world. (Mat. iii. 11; John, i. 29.) Did
the fore-runner of the coming of God, for Immanuel is God
with men, appear without the state, grandeur, and luxury
of the world; and shall those who pretend to receive the
message, and that for glad tidings too, and confess the
Immanuel, Jesus Christ, to be the Lord, live in the vanity
and excess of the world, and care more for their fine
clothes, delicate dishes, rich furniture, stately attendance,
and pleasant diversion, than for the holy cross of Christ,
and blessed narrow way that leadeth to salvation. Be
ashamed, and repent!

III. Peter, Andrew, Philip, and the rest of the holy
apostles, were, by calling as well as doctrine, not a luxurious
people; for they were made up of poor fishermen
and mechanics; for Christ called not his disciples out of
the higher ranks of men, nor had they ability any more
than will to use the excesses herein reproved. You may
conceive what their lives were, by what their Master's
doctrine was; for they were the true scholars of his heavenly
discipline. Peter thus speaks, and exhorteth the
Christians of his time, "Let not your adorning be that[301]
outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and the wearing of
gold, and of putting on of apparel; but let it be the
hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible,
even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in
the sight of God of great price; for after this manner, in
the old time, the holy women, who also trusted in God,
adorned themselves." (1 Pet. iii. 3, 4.) Wherefore gird
up the loins of your minds, be sober and hope to the end,
as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according
to your former lusts, in your ignorance, but as He which
hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of
conversation: (1 Pet. i. 13-15:) and giving all diligence,
add to your faith, virtue; to virtue, knowledge; and to
knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience;
and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly-kindness;
and to brotherly-kindness, charity; for if these
things be in you and abound, they make you, that you
shall be neither barren nor unfruitful: for so an entrance
shall be ministered unto you abundantly, into the everlasting
kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;
(2 Pet. i. 5-8, 11;) not rendering evil for evil, or railing for
railing; but contrariwise, blessing; knowing that ye are
thereunto called, that ye shall inherit a blessing: (1 Pet.
iii. 9:) for even hereunto were ye called, because Christ
also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should
follow his steps, who did no sin, neither was guile found
in his mouth; who, when He was reviled, reviled not again;
when He suffered, He threatened not, but committed himself
to Him that judgeth righteously. (1 Pet. ii. 21-23.)

IV. Paul, who was also an apostle, though, as he saith,
born out of due time: a man of great knowledge and
learning, but, "I count it," saith he, "all loss for the
excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for
whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count
them but dung, that I may win Christ. Brethren, be[302]
followers of me, and mark them which walk so, as ye have
us for an ensample: for many walk, of whom I have told
you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are
the enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction;
whose god is their belly; they glory in their shame,
and they mind earthly things. For our conversation is in
heaven; from whence we look also for the Saviour, the
Lord Jesus Christ." (Phil. iii. 8, 18.) In like manner
also, "I will that women adorn themselves in modest
apparel, with shame-facedness and sobriety, not with
broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but with
good works, as becometh women professing godliness."
(1 Tim. ii. 9, 10.) "Be followers of God, as dear children,
and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us: but fornication,
and all uncleanness, and covetousness, let it not
be once named amongst you, as becometh saints; neither
filthiness nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not
convenient; but rather giving of thanks: for this ye know,
that no whoremonger, unclean person, nor covetous man,
who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of
Christ, and of God. See, then, that you walk circumspectly,
not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time,
because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise,
but understanding what the will of the Lord is; and be
not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
with the Spirit, speaking to yourselves in hymns and spiritual
songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to
the Lord." (Ephes. v.) "Rejoice in the Lord always;
and again, I say rejoice. Let your moderation be known
to all men, for the Lord is at hand." (Phil. iv. 4-6.)
"Be careful for nothing, for we brought nothing into this
world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out: and,
having food and raiment, let us be therewith content; for
godliness, with contentment, is great gain: but they that
will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into[303]
many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in perdition
and destruction; for the love of money is the root
of all evil, which whilst some coveted after, they have
erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with
many sorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things,
and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience,
meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, and lay
hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and
hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.
I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth
all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius
Pilate witnessed a good confession, that thou keep this
commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing
of our Lord Jesus Christ. Charge them that are
rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust
in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us
richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be
rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate,
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation
against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal
life. O Timothy, keep that which is committed to
thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions
of science, falsely so called, which some professing,
have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee,
Amen." (1 Tim. vi. 7, to the end.) This was the blessed
doctrine these messengers of eternal life declared, and
what is more, they lived as they spoke. You find an
account of their reception in the world, and the way of
their living, in his first epistle to the Corinthians; "For I
think," saith he, "that God hath set forth us, the apostles
last, as it were, appointed to death; for we are made a
spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. We are
fools for Christ's sake: we are weak, we are despised:
even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst,
and have no certain dwelling-place, and labour, working[304]
with our hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted
we suffer it; being defamed, we intreat. We are made
as the filth of the world, and are as the off-scouring of all
things unto this day." (1 Cor. iv. 9.) This was the entertainment
those faithful followers of Jesus received at the hands
of an ungrateful world; but he who tells us of this, also
tells us, it is no unusual thing: "For," saith he, "such as
will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution."
Besides, he knew it had been the portion of the righteous
in preceding ages, as in his excellent account of the
faith, trials, and victory of the holy ancients, in his epistle
to the Hebrews he does largely express, where he tells us,
how great a sojourner Abraham was, even in the land of
promise, a stranger in his own country, for God had given
it unto him and his posterity, dwelling, saith he, in tents
with Isaac and Jacob. And why not better settled?
Was it for want of understanding, or ability, or materials?
No; he gives a better reason; for, saith he, Abraham
looked for a city which had foundations, whose builder
and maker is God. And speaking of Moses, he tells us,
"that, by faith, when he was come to years of discretion,
he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming
the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of
Egypt; for he had respect unto the recompense of reward;
nor feared he the wrath of the king, for he endured,
seeing him who is invisible." He adds, "And others had
trials of cruel mockings and scourgings; yea, moreover of
bonds and imprisonments; they were stoned, they were
sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword;
they wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being
destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not
worthy. They wandered in deserts, and in mountains,
and in dens, and caves of the earth, and these all have[305]
obtained a good report." Methinks this should a little
abate the intemperance of professed Christians. I do not
bid them be thus miserable, but I would not have them
make themselves so hereafter; for this afflicted life hath
joys transcending the utmost pleasure that sin can give,
and in the end it will be found, that it were better to be a
poor pilgrim, than a citizen of the world. Nor was this
only the life and instruction of apostolical teachers; the
same plainness and simplicity of life was also followed by
the first Christians.

V. "The primitive Christians,"[46] Ouzelius, in his animadversions
on Minutius Felix, saith, "were reproached
by the Gentiles for their ill-breeding, rude and unpolished
language, unfashionable behaviour, as a people that knew
not how to carry themselves in their addresses and salutations,
calling them rustics and clowns, which the Christians
easily bore, valuing their profession the more for its
nonconformity to the world: wherefore it was usual with
them, by way of irony and contempt, to call the Gentiles,
the well-bred, the eloquent, and the learned." This he
proves by ample testimonies out of Arnobius, Lactantius,
Isidorus Pelusiota, Theodoret, and others. Which may
instruct us, that the Christians' behaviour was not regulated
by the customs of the country they lived in, as is
usually objected against our singularity: no, they refused
the embellishment of art, and would not wear the furniture
of her invention, but as they were singular in their religion,
so in the way of their conversation among men.

VI. Clement Romanus,[47] if author of the constitutions
that go under his name, hath this among the rest, "Abstain
from the vain books of the Gentiles. What have
you to do with strange and unprofitable discourses, which
only serve to seduce weak persons?" This Clement is[306]
remembered by Paul in one of his epistles, (Phil. iv. 3,)
who in this exactly follows his advice to Timothy, about
vain questions, doubtful disputes, and opposition of science.
Let us see how this moderation and purity of manners
continued.

VII. Machiavel,[48] no mean author, in his Disputations,
assures us, "That the first promoters of Christianity were
so diligent in rooting out the vanities and superstitions of
the Gentiles, that they commanded all such poets' and historians'
books, who commended anything of the Gentile
conversation or worship, to be burned;" but that zeal is
evidently extinguished, and those follies revived among
the professors of the religion of Jesus.

VIII. Tertullian,[49] Chrysostom, Theophylact, Gregory
Nazianzene, upon these words of Christ, "But I say unto
you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall
give an account thereof in the day of judgment:" (Mat.
xii. 36:) thus reflect upon vain discourse: "These words
mean," saith Tertullian, "of all vain and superfluous
speech, more talk than is necessary." Says Chrysostom,
"of such words as are not convenient or profitable, but
move immodestly." Says Theophylact, "of all lies,
calumnies, all inordinate and ridiculous speeches." Says
Gregory, "such words men shall account for, which
want that profit ever redounding from modest discourses,
and that are seldom uttered from any preceding necessity
or cause; things frivolous, fables, old wives' tales." All
which sufficiently reprehend the plays, poetry, and romances
of the times, of great folly, vanity, and sin.

IX. Gregory, and this a father of the church, a very extraordinary
man, was so zealous for the simplicity and purity
of the mind, language, and lives of the Christians of
his time, that he suppressed several Greek authors, as Menander,[307]
Diphilus, Apollodorus, Philemon, Alexis, Sappho,
and others, which were the recreations of the vain Gentiles:
thus Cardan. Hear his judgment of fine clothes,
none of the least part of the luxury and vanity of the age.
"There be some," saith he, "are of opinion, that the
wearing of precious and sumptuous apparel is no sin;
which if it were no fault, the Divine word would never
have so punctually expressed, nor historically related, how
the rich man, that was tormented in hell, was clothed in
purple and silk: whence we may note, that, touching the
matter or subject of attire, human curiosity availeth highly.
The first substance of our garments was very mean, to wit,
skins, with wool; when it is we read, God made Adam
and his wife coats of skins; that is, of skins of dead beasts.
Afterwards, to see the growing pride and vanity of men
and women, they came to pure wool, because lighter; after
that to flax: then to dung and ordure of worms, to wit,
silk; lastly, to gold and silver, and precious stones, which
excess of apparel highly displeased God: for instance
whereof, which the very Pagans themselves observed, we
read that the very first among the Romans that ever wore
purple was struck with a thunder-bolt, and so died suddenly
for a terror to all succeeding times, that none should
attempt to live proudly in precious attire." This was the
sense of Gregory Nazianzene, that ancient Christian
writer, who wore commonly a poor coat, like to a frock;
so did Justin Martyr, Jerome, and Austin, as their best
robe.

X. Ambrose, called a father, who was lieutenant to the
province and city of Milan, and upon his discreet appeasing
the multitude, disordered upon some difference amongst
them about electing a bishop, was by their uniform consent
chosen himself: although this person, of all others, might
have been thought to plead for the accustomed recreations,
especially not having been long a Christian, for he was a[308]
Catechumen, or one but lately instructed, at the time
of his being elected; yet doth he in so many words
determine the matter thus: "Plays ought not to be known
by Christians;" then not made, heard, and defended by
Christians; or they must be none that do so.

XI. Augustine,[50] more famous for his many books, and
knowledge in church affairs, whose sentences are oracles
with some, gives this as his opinion of plays, and the like
recreations, that they were more pernicious and abominable
than those idolatrous sacrifices, which were offered in
honour of the pagan gods. Doubtless he thought the one
not so offensive to reason and the impressions divinity hath
made on every understanding, as the other were very pleasant
to the senses, and therefore apt to steal away the
mind from better things; for it was his maxim,[51] that everything
a man doth, is either a hindrance or furtherance to
good. This would be esteemed intolerable doctrine in a
poor Quaker, yet will the Quaker rejoice, if it be esteemed
and followed as good doctrine in Augustine.

XII. The council of Carthage, though times began to
look somewhat mistier, and the purity and spirituality of
religion to be much declined by the professors of Christianity;
yet there was so much zeal left against the worst
part of Heathenism, that I find an express canon against
the reading of vain books and comedies of the Gentiles,
lest the minds of the people should be defiled by them.
But this age either hath no such canon, or executeth it
not, to the shame of their profession.

XIII. Cardan more particularly relateth,[52] how even
Gregory the Great was so zealous of preserving purity of
manners among Christians, who lived almost two hundred
years after the Carthaginian council, that he caused many[309]
Latin authors to be burned, as vain and lascivious; as
Cæcilianus, Affranius, Navius, Licinus, Ennius, Attilius,
Victor, Lucian's Dialogues; nor did Plautus, Martial, and
Terence, so much in request both in the schools and academies
of the land, escape their honest zeal, although the
multitude of copies so far frustrated their good intentions,
as that they are multiplied of late.

XIV. Gratian also[53] had such like passages as these,
"We see that the priests of the Lord, neglecting the gospel
and the prophets, read comedies or play-books, and
sing love verses, and read Virgil," a book in which are
some good expressions. Strange! that these things
should have been so sincerely censured of old, and that
persons whose names are had in so much reverence, should
repute these their censures the constructions of Christ's
precepts, and the natural consequences of the Christian
doctrine; and yet that they should be so far neglected of
this age, as not to be judged worthy an imitation. But
pray let us hear what doctrine the Waldenses teach in this
affair.

XV. The Waldenses[54] were a people so called from one
Peter Waldo, a citizen of Lyons in France, in the year
1160, who inhabited Piedmont, elsewhere called Albigenses,
from Albi, a city of Languedoc in France; Lollards
in England, from one Reynard Lollard, who some time
after came into these parts, and preached boldly against
the idolatries, superstitions, and vain conversation of the
inhabitants of this island. They had many other names,
as Arnoldists, Esperonists, Henricians, Siccars, Insabaches,
Paterenians, Turlupins, Lyonists, Fraticelli, Hussites, Bohemians[310]
(still the same;) but finally, by their enemies,
damnable heretics, though by the Protestants, the true
church of Christ. And to omit many testimonies, I will
instance only in Bishop Usher, who in his discourse of
the succession of the Christian church, defends them not
only as true reformers, but makes the succession of the
Protestant church to be mainly evincible from their antiquity.
I shall forbear all the circumstances and principles
they held, or in which he strongly defends them against the
cruelty and ignorance of their adversaries, particularly
Rainerius, Rubis, Capetaneis, &amp;c. only what they held
concerning our present subject of apparel and recreations,
I cannot be so injurious to the truth, their self-denial, the
good of others, at whose reformation I aim, and my own
discourse, as to omit it. And therefore I shall proceed to
allege their faith and practice in these matters, however
esteemed but of a trifling importance, by the loose, wanton,
and carnal minded of this generation, whose feeling
is lost by the enjoyment of their inordinate desires,
and that think it a high state of Christianity to be no better
than the beasts that perish, namely, in not being excessive
in Newgate and mere kennel enormities. That
these ancient reformers had another sense of these things,
and that they made the conversation of the gospel of a
crucified Jesus to intend and require another sort of life,
than what is used by almost all those who account themselves
members of his church, I shall show out of their
own doctrines, as found in their most authentic histories.

XVI. To be brief, in their exposition upon the Lord's
prayer, that part of it which speaks thus, "Give us this
day our daily bread:"[55] where, next to that spiritual bread,[311]
which they make it to be the duty of all to seek more than
life, they come positively to deny the praying for more than
is requisite for outward necessities, or that it is lawful to use
more; condemning all superfluity and excess, out of fashion,
pride, or wantonness, not only of bread, but all outward
things, which they judge to be thereby comprehended;
using Ezekiel's words,[56] (Ezek. xvi. 45,) that fulness of
bread, and abundance of idleness were the cause of the
wickedness and the abominations of Sodom, for which
God by fire destroyed them off the earth. Whereupon
they conclude with an ancient father of the primitive
church, after this manner, that costly apparel, superfluity
in diet, as three dishes when one will serve, play, idleness,
and sleep, fatten the body, nourish luxury, weaken the spirit,
and lead the soul unto death; "But," say they, "a spare
diet, labour, short sleep, plain and mean garments, help to
purify the soul, tame the body, mortify the lusts of the
flesh, and comfort the spirit." So severe were they, that, in
the chapter of the instructions of their children,[57] they
would not suffer them to converse with those of strange
places or principles, whose conversation was gaming,
plays, and the like wanton recreations; but especially concerning
young women. "A man," say they, "must have
a great care of his daughter. Hast thou daughters?
Keep them within to wholesome things; see they wander
not; for Dinah, Jacob's daughter, was corrupted by being
seen of strangers." They affirm no better to be the general
event of such conversation.

To which I shall add their judgment and practice concerning
taverns,[58] public houses for treats and pleasures,
with which the land swarms in our days.
[312]
XVII. "A tavern is the fountain of sin,[59] the school of
the devil; it works wonders fitting the place. It is the
custom of God to show his power in his church, and to
work miracles; that is to say, to give sight to the spiritually
blind, to make the lame to leap, the dumb to sing, the
deaf to hear: but the devil doth quite contrary to all these
in taverns, and the like places of pleasure. For when the
drunkard goes to the tavern, he goes upright: but when he
comes forth, he cannot go at all; he has lost his sight,
speech, and hearing too." "The lectures that are read in
this school of the devil," say these poor Waldenses, and
first reformers, "are gluttonies, oaths, perjuries, lyings,
blasphemies, flatteries, and divers other wicked villanies
and pernicious effects, by which the heart is withdrawn
further and further from God." And, as the book of Ecclesiasticus
saith, the taverner shall not be freed from sin.

But above other recreations, do but seriously observe,
of what danger and ill consequence these first reformers
thought dancing, music, and the like pastimes to be, which
are the greatest divertisements of the times, viz.:

XVIII. "Dancing is the devil's procession,[60] and he
that entereth into a dance entereth into his procession, the
devil is the guide, the middle, and the end of the dance;
as many paces as man maketh in dancing, so many paces
doth he make to go to hell.[61] A man sinneth in dancing
divers ways, for all his steps are numbered, in his touch,
in his ornaments, in his hearing, sight, speech, and other
vanities. And therefore we will prove, first by the Scripture,
and afterwards by divers other reasons, how wicked
a thing it is to dance. The first testimony that we will
produce is that which we read in the gospel, where it is[313]
said, it pleased Herod so well, that it cost John Baptist
his life. (Mark, vi. 22-28; Exodus, xxxii. 4-7, 19.)
The second is in Exodus, when Moses, coming near to the
congregation, saw the calf, he cast the tables from him,
and broke them at the foot of the mountain; and afterwards
it cost three thousand of their lives. Besides, the
ornaments which women wear in their dances, are as
crowns for many victories which the devil hath got
against the children of God: for the devil hath not only
one sword in the dance, but as many as there are beautiful
and well-adorned persons in the dance; for the words of
a woman are a glittering sword. And therefore that place
is much to be feared wherein the enemy hath so many
swords, since that only one sword of his may be justly
feared. Again, the devil in this place strikes with a
sharpened sword; for women, who make it acceptable,
come not willingly to the dance, if they be not painted
and adorned; which painting and ornament is as a whetstone
on which the devil sharpeneth his sword.&mdash;They
that deck and adorn their daughters, are like those that
put dry wood to the fire, to the end it may burn the
better: for such women kindle the fire of luxury in the
hearts of men. As Sampson's foxes fired the Philistines'
corn, so these women, they have fire in their faces, and
in their gestures and actions, their glances and wanton
words, by which they consume the goods of men." They
proceed, "The devil in the dance useth the strongest
armour that he hath: for his most powerful arms are
women; which is made plain unto us, in that the devil
made choice of the woman to deceive the first man; so did
Balaam, that the children of Israel might be rejected of
God. By a woman he made Sampson, David, and Absalom
to sin. The devil tempteth men by women three
manner of ways; that is, by the touch, by the eye, by the
ear; by these three means he tempteth foolish men to[314]
dancing, by touching their hands, beholding their beauty,
hearing their songs and music."&mdash;Again, "They that
dance break that promise and agreement they have made
with God in baptism, when their godfathers promise for
them, that they shall renounce the devil and all his pomp;
for dancing is the pomp of the devil; and he that danceth
maintaineth his pomp, and singeth his mass. For the
woman that singeth in the dance is the prioress, or chief
of the devil, and those that answer are the clerks, and the
beholders are the parishioners, and the music are the
bells, and the fiddlers the ministers of the devil. For, as
when hogs are strayed, if the hogherd call one, all assemble
themselves together; so the devil causeth one woman to sing
in the dance, or to play on some instrument, and presently
gather all the dancers together."&mdash;Again, "In a dance, a
man breaks the ten commandments of God: as first, Thou
shalt have no other God but me, &amp;c., for in dancing, a
man serves that person whom he most desires to serve,
after whom goes his heart; and therefore Jerome saith,
'Every man's god is that he serves and loves best;'[62] and
that he loves best which his thoughts wander and gad
most after. He sins against the second commandment
when he makes an idol of that he loves. Against the
third, in that oaths, and frivolously using God's name, are
frequently among dancers. Against the fourth, for that
by dancing the sabbath-day is profaned. Against the
fifth, for in the dance parents are many times dishonoured,
since thereby many bargains are made without their
counsel. Against the sixth, a man kills in dancing, for
every one that sets about to please another, he kills the
soul as oft as he persuades unto lust. Against the seventh,
for the party that danceth, be it male or female, committeth
adultery with the party they lust after; for he
that looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath already[315]
committed adultery with her in his heart. Against the
eighth, a man sins in dancing when he withdraweth the
heart of another from God. Against the ninth, when in
dancing he speaks falsely against the truth, and for some
little honour, or secret lascivious end, denies what is true,
or affirms what is false. Against the tenth, when women
affect the ornaments of others, and men covet the wives,
daughters, and servants of their neighbours, which undeniably
attends all such plays and sports."&mdash;Again, "A
man may prove how great an evil dancing is, by the
multitude of sins that accompany those that dance; for
they dance without measure or number;" "And therefore,"
saith Augustine,[63] "the miserable dancer knows not,
that as many paces as he makes in dancing, so many
leaps he makes to hell. They sin in their ornaments after
a five-fold manner: First, by being proud thereof. Secondly,
by inflaming the hearts of those that behold them.
Thirdly, when they make those ashamed that have not
the like ornaments, giving them occasion to covet the
like. Fourthly, by making women importunate in demanding
the like ornaments of their husbands: and,
Fifthly, when they cannot obtain them of their husbands,
they seek to get them elsewhere by sin. They sin by
singing and playing on instruments; for their songs bewitch
the hearts of those that hear them with temporal
delight, forgetting God; uttering nothing in their songs
but lies and vanities; and the very motion of the body
which is used in dancing, gives testimony enough of evil.&mdash;Thus,
you see that dancing is the devil's procession,
and he that enters into a dance, enters into the devil's
procession. Of dancing, the devil is the guide, the middle,
and the end; and he that entereth a good and wise
man into the dance, if it can be that such an one is either
good or wise, cometh forth a corrupt and wicked man:[316]
Sarah, that holy woman, was none of these."[64] Behold
the apprehensions of those good old reformers, touching
those things that are so much in practice and reputation
in these times, with such as profess their religion: thus
far verbatim. But I cannot leave off here, till I have yet
added the conclusion of their catechism and direction,
and some passages out of one of their pastor's letters, fit
to the present occasion.

They conclude with this direction, namely, how to rule
their bodies,[65] and live in this world as becomes the children
of God. Not to serve the mortal desires of the flesh.
To keep their members, that they be not arms of iniquity
and vanity. To rule their outward senses. To subject
the body to the soul. To mortify their members. To fly
idleness. To observe a sobriety and measure in eating
and drinking, in their words and cares of this life. To do
works of mercy. To live a moral or just life by faith.
To fight against the desires. To mortify the works of the
flesh. To give themselves to the exercise of religion.
To confer together touching the will of God: to examine
diligently the conscience. To purge and amend, and
pacify the spirit.

To which I add the epistle of one of their pastors, as I
find it recorded amongst other matters relating to these
poor afflicted people.

XIX. An epistle of pastor Bartholomew Tertian, written
to the Waldensian churches of the valley of Pragela,
thus translated:

"JESUS BE WITH YOU.



"To all our faithful and well beloved brethren in
Christ Jesus,[66] health and salvation be with you all: Amen![317]
These are to put you in remembrance, and to admonish
you, my brethren, hereby acquitting myself of that duty
which I owe unto you all, in the behalf of God, principally
touching the care of your souls' salvation, according
to that light of the truth, which the most high God hath
bestowed on us, that it would please every one of you to
maintain, increase, and nourish, to the utmost of your
power, without diminution, those good beginnings and
examples which have been left unto us by our forefathers,
whereof we are no ways worthy. For it would little profit
us to have been renewed by the fatherly visitation, and
the light which hath been given us of God, if we give
ourselves to worldly, carnal conversations, which are
diabolical; abandoning the principle which is of God,
and the salvation of our souls, for this short and temporal
life. For the Lord saith, 'What doth it profit a man to
gain the whole world, and to lose his own soul?' For it
would be better for us never to have known the way of
righteousness, than having known it, to do the contrary.
Let me therefore intreat you, by the love of God, that you
decrease not, or look back; but rather increase the
charity, fear, and obedience, which is due unto God, and
to yourselves, amongst yourselves; and stand fast in all
these good principles, which you have heard and understood
of God, by our means: and that you would remove
from amongst you all vain conversation and evil surmises,
troubling the peace, the love, the concord, and whatsoever
would indispose or deaden your minds to the service of
God, your own salvation, and the administration of the
truth, if you desire that God should be merciful to you in
your goods temporal and spiritual: for you can do nothing
without Him; and if you desire to be heirs of his glory,
do that which He commandeth: If you would enter into
life, keep my commandments. (Matt. xix. 17.)

"Likewise be careful that there be not nourished[318]
among you any sports, gluttony, whoredom, dancings, nor
any lewdness, nor riot, nor questions, nor deceits, nor
usury, nor discords; nor support nor entertain any persons
of a wicked conversation, or that give any scandal or ill
example amongst you; but let charity and fidelity reign
amongst you, and all good example; doing to one another
as every one desires should be done unto him; for otherwise
it is impossible that any should be saved, or can
have the grace of God, or be good men in this world, or
have glory in another. And therefore, if you hope and
desire to possess eternal life, to live in esteem and credit,
and to prosper in this world, in your goods temporal and
spiritual, purge yourselves from all disorderly ways, to the
end that God may be always with you, who forsakes not
those that trust in him. But know this for certain, that
God heareth not, nor dwelleth with sinners, nor in the
soul that is given unto wickedness, nor in the man that is
subject to sin. And therefore let every one cleanse the
ways of his heart, and fly the danger, if he would not
perish therein. I have no other things at this present,
but that you would put in practice these things; and the
God of peace be with you all, and go along with us, and
be present among us in our sincere, humble, and fervent
prayers, and that He will be pleased to save all those his
faithful, that trust in Christ Jesus.


"Entirely yours, ready to do you service in all
things possible, according to the will of God.

"Bartholomew Tertian."


XX. Behold the life and doctrine, instruction and
practice, of the ancient Waldenses.[67] How harmless,[319]
how plain, how laborious, how exceeding serious and
heavenly in their conversations! These were the men,
women, aye children too, who, for above five hundred
years, have valiantly, but passively maintained a cruel
war, at the expense of their own innocent blood, against
the unheard of cruelties and severities of several princes,
nuncios, and bishops; but above all, of certain cruel inquisitors,
of whom their historians report, that they held
it was a greater evil to conceal a heretic than to be guilty
of perjury; and for a clergyman to marry a wife than to
keep a whore. In short, to dissent, though never so conscientiously,
was worse than open immorality. It was
against the like adversaries these poor Waldenses fought,
by sufferings throughout the nations, by prisons, confiscations,
banishments,[68] wandering from hill to valley,
from den to cave; being mocked, whipped, racked, thrown
from rocks and towers, driven on mountains,[69] and in one
night thousands perished by excessive frost and snow,
smothered in caves, starved, imprisoned, ripped up, hanged,
dismembered, rifled, plundered, strangled, broiled, roasted,
burned; and whatsoever could be invented to ruin men,
women, and children. These Waldenses, you Protestants
pretend to be your ancestors: from them, you say, you have
your religion; and often, like the Jews of the prophets, are
you building their praises in your discourses: but, O look
back, I beseech you, how unlike are you to these afflicted
pilgrims! What resemblance is there of their life in
yours? Did they help to purchase and preserve you a
liberty and religion, can you think, at the loss of all that
was dear to them, that you might pass away your days
and years in pride, wantonness, and vanity? What proportion
bears your excess with their temperance;[70] your[320]
gaudiness with their plainness; your luxury and flesh-pleasing
conversations with their simplicity and self-denial?
But are you not got into that spirit and nature
they condemned in their day; into that carnality and
worldly mindedness they reproved in their persecutors,
nay, into a strain of persecution too, which you seem to
hide under a cloak of reformation? How can you hope
to refute their persecutors whose worst part perhaps was
their cruelty, that turn persecutors yourselves? What
have you besides their good words, that is like them?
And do you think that words will send off the blows of
eternal vengeance? That a little by-rote babble, though
of never so good expressions in themselves, shall serve
your turn at the great day? No, from God I tell you,
that whilst you live in the wantonness, pride, and luxury
of the world, pleasing and fulfilling the lust of the eye,
the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, (1 John, ii.
14-17,) God detests you all, and laughs you and your
worship to scorn. Never tell me, I am too rash; it is the
devil that says so; he has got two scriptures by the end
in these days: one, that there is none that doth good:
and why?[71] That he may persuade all it is impossible to
overcome him: which is the reason so many are overcome;
although glory is promised to none but conquerors.
The second, that we must not judge, lest we be judged:
that is, whilst we are guilty of the same things that are
equivalent, lest we are judged. But away with Satan and
his hypocrisy too: I know what I say, and from whom I
speak: once more I tell you all, whether you will hear or
forbear, that unless you forsake your pride, luxury, avarice,
and the whole variety of vanities, and diligently mind the
eternal light of God in your hearts, to obey it; wrath will
be your portion for ever. Trust not your souls upon misapplied
Scriptures; he that is a child of God must be[321]
holy, for God is holy; and none are his sons and daughters
but those who are adopted by the eternal Spirit, and
led thereby. (1 Pet. i. 15, 16; Rom. viii. 1-16.) It was
a holy, plain, humble, divine life, these poor suffering
Christians both professed and practised, refusing to converse
with such as lived in the superfluities and excess of
the world; for which, if you will believe their very adversaries,
they were persecuted: "For," says Rainerius,[72] a
great writer against them, "they used to teach, first,
what the disciples of Christ ought to be, and that none
are his disciples but they that imitate his life; and that
the popes, cardinals, &amp;c., because they live in luxury,
pride, avarice, &amp;c., are not the successors of Christ; but
themselves only, in that they walk up to his commandments;
thus," says he, "they win upon the people." But
if so, that none are Christians but those that imitate Christ,
what will become of those who call themselves Christians
and yet live at ease in the flesh, not regarding the work of
the holy cross of Christ in their hearts, that crucifies them
that bear it to the world, and the world to them? This
was the true ground of their sufferings, and their loud cries
against the impieties of the greatest; not sparing any
ranks, from the throne to the dunghill, as knowing their
God was no respecter of persons. And now, if you would
follow them indeed, if you would be Protestants in substance,
and learn your enemies a way worth their changing
for&mdash;else better words go but a little way&mdash;if you would
obtain the heavenly inheritance, and you would be eternally
blessed, be ye persuaded to forsake all the pride and
pomp of this vain world. O mind the concerns of an
everlasting rest! Let the just and serious principle of
God within you be the constant guide and companion of[322]
your minds, and let your whole hearts be exercised thereby,
that you may experience an entire reformation and change
of affections, through the power of that divine leaven
which leavens the whole lump, viz. body, soul, and spirit,
where it is received; to which, and its work in man, our
blessed Lord likened the kingdom of God which He came
to set up in the soul: that so having the joys and glory of
another world in your view, you may give your best diligence
to make your calling and election to the possession of
them sure and certain; lest, selling that noble inheritance
for a poor mess of perishing pottage, you never enter into
his eternal rest. And though this testimony may seem too
tedious, yet could it by no means be omitted.&mdash;To authorize
our last reason, of converting superfluities into the relief
of distressed persons, although one would think it so
equal and sober, that it needs no other authority than its
own, yet I shall produce two testimonies so remarkable,
that as they ever were esteemed truly good, so they cannot
be approved by any that refuse to do the same, without
condemning themselves of great iniquity. Oh, you are
called with an high and holy call; as high as heaven, and
as holy as God; for it is He that calls us to holiness
through Christ, who sent his Son to bless us, in turning us
from the evil of our ways; and unless we are so turned we
can have no claim to the blessing that comes by Christ to
men.

XXI. It is reported of Paulinus,[73] bishop of Nola in Italy,
that, instead of converting the demesnes of his diocese to
particular enrichment, he employed it all in the redemption
of poor slaves and prisoners: believing it unworthy of the
Christian faith, to see God's creation labour under the want
of what he had to spare. All agree this was well done,
but few agree to do the same.

XXII. But more particularly that of Acacius,[74] bishop of[323]
Amida, given us by Socrates Scholasticus, in this manner:
"When the Roman soldiers purposed in nowise to restore
again unto the king of Persia such captives as they had
taken at the winning of Azazena, being about seven
thousand in number, to the great grief of the king of Persia,
and all of them ready to starve for want of food: Acacius
lamented their condition, and calling his clergy
together, said thus unto them, 'Our God hath no need of
dishes or of cups, for He neither eateth nor drinketh; these
are not his necessaries; wherefore, seeing the church hath
many precious jewels, both of gold and silver, bestowed of
the free-will and liberality of the faithful, it is requisite
that the captive soldiers should be therewith redeemed,
and delivered out of prison and bondage, and they perishing
with famine should therewith be refreshed and relieved.'"
Thus he prevailed to have them all converted
into money; some for their immediate refreshment, some
for their redemption, and the rest for coastage or provision,
to defray the charges of their voyage. Which noble act
had such an universal influence, that it more famed the
Christian religion among the Infidels, than all their disputes
and battles: insomuch that the King of Persia, a
Heathen, said, "The Romans endeavour to win their adversaries
both by wars and favours;" and greatly desired
to behold that man, whose religion taught so much charity
to enemies; which, it is reported, Theodosius, the emperor,
commanded Acacius to gratify him in. And if the Apostle
Paul's expression hath any force, that "He is worse than
an infidel who provides not for his family;" (1 Tim. 5;)
how greatly doth his example aggravate your shame, that
can behold such pity and compassion expressed to
strangers, nay, enemies, and those infidels too, and be so
negligent of your own family; (for England, aye, Christendom,
in a sense, if not the world, is no more;) as not only
to see their great necessities unanswered, but that wherewith[324]
they should be satisfied, converted to gratify the lust
of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life? But
however such can please themselves, in the deceitful daubing
of their mercenary priests, and dream they are members
of Jesus Christ, it is certain that things were otherwise in
the beginning; for then all was sold, and put into a common
purse, to supply indigences: (Acts, iv. 32-37:) not mattering
earthly inheritances, further than as they might, in
some sense, be subservient to the great end for which they
were given; namely, the good of the creation. Thus had
the purest Christians their minds and thoughts taken up
with the better things, and raised with the assurance of a
more excellent life and inheritance in the heavens, that
will never pass away. And for any to flatter themselves with
being Christians, whilst so much exercised in the vanities,
recreations, and customs of the world, as at this very day we
see they are, is to mock the great God, and abuse their immortal
souls. The Christian life is quite another thing.

And lest that any should object, many do great and
seemingly good actions to raise their reputation only; and
others only decry pleasure, because they have not wherewithal,
or know not how to take it; I shall present them
with the serious sayings of aged and dying men, and those
of the greatest note and rank, whose experience could not
be wanting to give the truest account, how much their honours,
riches, pleasures, and recreations, conduced to their
satisfaction, upon a just reckoning, as well before their extreme
moments as upon their dying beds, when death,
that hard passage into eternity, looked them in the face.

Seigneur du Renti.


I. Solomon, than whom none is believed to have more
delighted himself in the enjoyments of the world, at least
better to have understood them; hear what he says, after
all his experience: (Eccles. ii. 1-11:) "I said in my heart,
Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy
pleasure: and behold, this also is vanity. I said of laughter,
it is mad: and of mirth, what doth it? I made me
great works, builded houses, planted vineyards, made gardens
and orchards, planted trees in them of all kinds
of fruit: I got me servants and maidens, also great
possessions: I gathered me silver and gold, and the peculiar[326]
treasure of kings and provinces; also men and women,
singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical
instruments, and that of all sorts. So I was great, and increased
more than all that were before me in Jerusalem,
and whatsoever mine eyes desired, I kept not from them:
I withheld not mine heart from any joy. Then I looked
on the works which mine hands had wrought, and behold,
all was vanity and vexation of spirit." The reason he gives
in the 18th and 19th verses is, that the time of enjoying
them was very short, and it was uncertain who should be
benefited by them when he was gone. Wherefore, he
concludes with all this: "Fear God, and keep his commandments,
for this is the whole duty of man: for God
shall bring every work into judgment, whether it be good,
or whether it be evil." O that men would lay this to
heart!

II. Chilon,[75] one of the seven wise men of Greece,
already mentioned upon another occasion, affords us a
dying testimony of great example. It is related thus by
A. Gellius: when his life drew towards an end, ready to
be seized by death, he spoke thus to his friends about
him: "My words and actions, in this long term of years,
have been, almost all, such as I need not repent of; which,
perhaps, you also know: truly, even at this time I am certain
I never committed anything the remembrance of
which begets any trouble in me, unless this one thing
only: which, whether it were done amiss or not, I am uncertain.
I sat with two others as judge, upon the life of
my friend: the law was such, as the person must of necessity
be condemned, so that either my friend must lose his
life, or some deceit be used towards the law. Revolving
many things in my mind, for relief of a condition
so desperate, I conceived that which I put in practice to[327]
be of all others the most easy to be borne: silently I condemned
him, and persuaded those others who judged, to
absolve him: thus I preserved in so great a business, the
duty both of a judge and a friend. But from that act I received
this trouble: that I fear it is not free from perfidiousness
and guilt, in the same business, at the same time,
and in a public affair, to persuade others contrary to what
was in my own judgment best." Oh, tender conscience!
Yet an Heathen's. Where dwells the Christian that excelleth?
Hard to be found among the great rabbies of
Christendom.

III. Ignatius,[76] who lived within the first hundred years
after Christ, left this, amongst other things, behind him,
who was torn in pieces of wild beasts at Rome, for his
true faith in Jesus, "There is nothing better than the
peace of a good conscience;" intimating there might be a
peace to wicked consciences, that are past feeling anything
to be evil, but swallowed up of the wickedness of
the world. And in his epistles to the churches at Ephesus,
Magnesia, Trallis, and Rome, upon his martyrdom,
saith, "Now I begin to be a disciple, I weigh neither visible
nor invisible things, so that I may gain Christ." Oh,
heavenly-minded man! A blessed martyr of Jesus indeed.

IV. Justin Martyr, a philosopher who received Christianity
five-and-twenty years after the death of Ignatius,
plainly tells us, in his relation of his conversion to
the Christian faith, that the power of godliness in a
plain, simple Christian, had that influence and operation
on his soul, that he could not but betake himself to a serious
and strict life; and yet, before, he was a Cynic, a strict
sect: and this gave him joy at his martyrdom, having
spent his days as a serious teacher, and a good example.
And Eusebius relates, that, though he was also a follower[328]
of Plato's doctrine,[77] yet when he saw the Christians' piety
and courage, he concluded, no people so temperate, less
voluptuous, and more set on divine things: which first induced
him to be a Christian.

V. Chrysostom, another father, so called, lays this down
for necessary doctrine, "To sacrifice the whole soul and
body to the Lord, is the highest service we can pay unto
Him. God promiseth mercy unto penitent sinners; but He
doth not promise them they shall have so much time as to-morrow
for their repentance."

VI. Charles V. Emperor of Germany, King of Spain,
and Lord of the Netherlands, after three-and-twenty pitched
fields, six triumphs, four kingdoms conquered, and eight
principalities added to his dominions, a greater instance
than whom can scarce be given, resigned up all his pomp
to other hands, and betook himself to his retirement;
leaving this testimony behind him, concerning the life he
spent in the honours and pleasures of the world, and in
that little time of his retreat from them all: that the sincere
study, profession, and practice of the Christian religion,
had in it such joys and sweetness as courts were
strangers to.

VII. Cardinal Wolsey, the most absolute and wealthy
minister of state this kingdom ever had, that in his time
seemed to govern Europe as well as England, when come
to the period of his life, left the world with this close reflection
upon himself: "Had I been as diligent to serve
my God, as I was to please my king, He would not have
left me now in my grey hairs." A dismal reflection for
all worldly-minded men; but those more especially, who
have the power and means of doing more good than ordinary
in the world, and do it not; which seems to have
been the case and reflection of this great man.

[329]

VIII. Sir Philip Sidney, a subject indeed of England,
but they say chosen king of Poland, whom Queen Elizabeth
called her Philip; the Prince of Orange, his master;
whose friendship the lord Brooks was so proud of, that he
would have it part of his epitaph, "Here lies Sir Philip
Sidney's friend;" whose death was lamented in verse by
the then kings of France and Scotland, and the two
universities of England; repented so much at his death
of that witty vanity of his life, his Arcadia, that, to prevent
the unlawful kindling of heats in others, he would have
committed it to the flames himself: and left this farewell
amongst his friends, "Love my memory, cherish my
friends; their faith to me may assure you that they are
honest; but above all govern your wills and affections by
the will and word of your Creator. In me behold the end
of this world, and all its vanities." And indeed he was
not much out in saying so, since in him was to be seen
the end of all natural parts, acquired learning, and civil
accomplishments. His farewell seems spoken without
terror, with a clear sense, and an equal judgment.

IX. Secretary Walsingham, an extraordinary man in
Queen Elizabeth's time, towards the conclusion of his
days, in a letter to his fellow-secretary Burleigh, then lord-treasurer
of England, writes thus: "We have lived enough
to our country, our fortunes, our sovereign: it is high
time we begin to live to ourselves, and to our God."
Which, giving occasion for some court-droll to visit and
try to divert him: "Ah!" said he, "while we laugh, all
things are serious round about us; God is serious, when
He preserveth us, and hath patience towards us; Christ is
serious when He dieth for us; the Holy Ghost is serious,
when He striveth with us; the whole creation is serious,
in serving God and us; they are serious in hell and in
heaven: and shall a man, that has one foot in the grave,
jest and laugh?" O that our statesmen would weigh the[330]
conviction, advice, and conclusion of this great man, and
the greatest man, perhaps, that has borne that character in
our nation! For true it is, that none can be serious too
soon, because none can be good too soon. Away, then,
with all foolish talking and jesting, and let people mind
more profitable things.

X. John Mason, knight, who had been privy-counsellor
to four princes, and spent much time in the preferments
and pleasures of the world, retired with these pathetical
and regretful sayings: "After so many years' experience,
seriousness is the greatest wisdom; temperance the best
physic; a good conscience is the best estate. And were
I to live again, I would change the court for a cloister, my
privy-counsellor's bustles for a hermit's retirement, and
the whole life I lived in the palace, for one hour's enjoyment
of God in the chapel. All things else forsake me,
besides my God, my duty, and my prayers."

XI. Sir Walter Raleigh is an eminent instance, being
as extraordinary a man, as our nation hath produced; in
his person well descended; of health, strength, and a
masculine beauty; in understanding quick: in judgment
sound; learned and wise, valiant and skilful; a historian,
a philosopher, a general, a statesman. After a long life,
full of experience, he drops these excellent sayings, a little
before his death, to his son, to his wife, and to the world,
viz.: "Exceed not in the humour of rags and bravery, for
these will soon wear out of fashion: and no man is esteemed
for gay garments but by fools and women. On the
other side, seek not riches basely, nor attain them by evil
means: destroy no man for his wealth, nor take anything
from the poor; for the cry thereof will pierce the heavens:
and it is most detestable before God, and most dishonourable
before worthy men, to wrest anything from the needy
and labouring soul: God will never prosper thee, if thou
offendest therein; but use thy poor neighbours and tenants[331]
well." A most worthy saying. But he adds, "Have
compassion on the poor and afflicted, and God will bless
thee for it: make not the hungry soul sorrowful; for if he
curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his prayer shall be
heard of Him that made him. Now, for the world, dear
child, I know it too well to persuade thee to dive into the
practices of it; rather stand upon thy own guard against
all those that tempt thee to it, or may practise upon thee;
whether in thy conscience, thy reputation, or thy estate:
resolve, that no man is wise or safe but he that is honest.
Serve God; let Him be the Author of all thy actions: commend
all thy endeavours to Him, who most either wither
or prosper them: please Him with prayer; lest if He frown,
He confound all thy fortune and labour, like the drops of
rain upon the sandy ground. Let my experienced advice
and fatherly instructions sink deep into thy heart: so God
direct thee in all thy ways, and fill thy heart with his grace."


Sir Walter Raleigh's Letter to his Wife, after his
Condemnation.



"You shall receive, my dear wife, my last words, in
these my last lines. My love I send you, that you may
keep when I am dead; and my counsel, that you may remember
it when I am no more. I would not, with my
will, present you sorrows, dear Bess; let them go to the
grave with me, and be buried in the dust: and, seeing
that it is not the will of God that I shall see you any
more, bear my destruction patiently, and with a heart like
yourself. First, I send you all the thanks which my heart
can conceive, or my words express, for your many travails
and cares for me; which, though they have not taken
effect as you wished, yet my debt to you is not the less;
but pay it I never shall in this world. Secondly, I beseech
you, for the love you bear me living, that you do not hide
yourself many days; but by your travails seek to help my[332]
miserable fortunes, and the right of your poor child: your
mourning cannot avail me, who am but dust. Thirdly,
you shall understand, that my lands were conveyed, bona
fide, to my child; the writings were drawn at Midsummer
was at twelvemonth, as divers can witness: and I trust
my blood will quench their malice who desired my slaughter,
that they will not seek to kill you and yours with extreme
poverty. To what friend to direct you, I know not,
for all mine have left me, in the true time of trial: most
sorry am I, that, being surprised by death, I can leave you
no better estate: God hath prevented all my determinations,
that great God, which worketh all in all. If you
can live free from want, care for no more, for the rest is
but a vanity. Love God, and begin betimes; in Him shall
you find true, everlasting, and endless comfort: when you
have travailed and wearied yourself with all sorts of
worldly cogitations, shall you sit down by sorrow in the
end. Teach your son also to serve and fear God, whilst
he is young, that the fear of God may grow up in him;
then will God be a husband to you, and a father to him;
a husband and a father that can never be taken from you.
Dear wife, I beseech you, for my soul's sake, pay all poor
men. When I am dead, no doubt but you will be much
sought unto, for the world thinks I was very rich. Have a
care of the fair pretences of men; for no greater misery
can befal you in this life, than to become a prey unto the
world, and afterwards to be despised. As for me, I am no
more yours, nor you mine: death has cut us asunder, and
God hath divided me from the world, and you from me.
Remember your poor child, for his father's sake, who
loved you in his happiest estate. I sued for my life, but
God knows, it was for you and yours that I desired it: for
know it, my dear wife, your child is the child of a true
man, who in his own respect despiseth death, and his
misshapen and ugly forms. I cannot write much. God[333]
knows how hardly I steal this time, when all are asleep,
and it is also time for me to separate my thoughts from the
world. Beg my dead body, which living was denied you;
and either lay it in Sherborne, or in Exeter church, by my
father and mother. I can say no more; time and death
call me away. The everlasting God, powerful, infinite,
and inscrutable, God Almighty, who is goodness itself,
the true light and life, keep you and yours, and have
mercy upon me, and forgive my persecutors, and false
accusers; and send us to meet in his glorious kingdom.
My dear wife, farewell; bless my boy; pray for me; and
let my true God hold you both in his arms.


"Your's that was, but not now mine own,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Walter Raleigh."


Behold wisdom, resolution, nature, and grace! How
strong in argument, wise in counsel, firm, affectionate, and
devout! O that your heroes and politicians would make
him their example in his death, as well as magnify the
great actions of his life. I doubt not, had he been to live
over his days again, with his experience, he had made
less noise, and yet done more good to the world and himself.
It is a sad thing to consider, that, men hardly come
to know themselves or the world, till they are ready to
leave it.

XII. Henry Wotton, knight, thought it the greatest
happiness in this life, "to be at leisure to be and to do
good;" as in his latter end he was wont to say, when he
reflected on past times, though a man esteemed sober and
learned, "How much time have I to repent of, and how
little to do it in!"

XIII. Sir Christopher Hatton, a little before his death,
advised his relations to be serious in the search after "the
will of God in the holy word:" "for," said he, "it is deservedly
accounted a piece of excellent knowledge, to understand[334]
the law of the land, and the customs of a man's
country; how much more to know the statutes of heaven,
and the laws of eternity; those immutable and eternal
laws of justice and righteousness; to know the will and
pleasure of the great Monarch, and universal King of the
world: I have seen an end of all perfection, but thy commandments,
O God, are exceeding broad."

Whatever other knowledge a man may be endued
withal, could he by a vast and imperious mind, and a
heart as large as the sand upon the sea-shore, command
all the knowledge of art and nature, of words and things;
could he attain a mystery in all languages, and sound the
depth of all arts and sciences; could he discourse of the
interests of all states, the intrigues of all courts, the reason
of all civil laws and constitutions, and give an account of
all histories; and yet not know the Author of his being,
and the Preserver of his life, his Sovereign, and his Judge;
his surest refuge in trouble: his best Friend; the support
of his life, and the hope of his death; his future happiness,
and his portion for ever; he doth but sapienter
descendere in infernum, with a great deal of wisdom go
down to Hell.

XIV. Francis Bacon, lord high-chancellor of England,
some time before his death, confessed, that, to be religious,
was to live strictly and severely; for if the opinion of
another world be false, yet the sweetest life in this world
is piety, virtue, and honesty; if it were true, there be none
so wretched and miserable, as loose, carnal, and profane
persons.

XV. The great duke de Montmorency, colleague to the
duke of Orleans, brother to the French king, Lewis XIII.,
in the war by them agitated against the ministry of Cardinal
Richlieu, being taken and convicted at Lyons, a little
before his beheading, looking upon himself, then very
richly attired; "Ah!" says he, "this becomes not a servant[335]
of the crucified Jesus! What do I with these vanities
about me? He was poor, despised, and naked, when He
went to the cross to die for my sins;" and immediately he
stripped himself of all his finery, and put a more grave
and modest garment on him: a serious reflection, at a time
when he best knew what was best.

XVI. Henry, Prince of Wales, eldest son to king James
I., of whom others say many excellent things, hear what
account he gives of himself at last: a person whom he
loved, and that had been the companion of his diversions,
being with him in his sickness, and asking him how he
did, was, amongst many other sober expressions, answered
thus: "Ah, Tom! I in vain wish for that time I lost with
thee and others in vain recreations." So vain were recreations,
and so precious was time to a prince, and no ordinary
one neither, upon a dying bed. But why wished he
with others for more time, but that it might be better employed?
Thus hath the just principle and holy Spirit of
God in men, throughout all generations, convinced them
of their vanity and folly upon their dying beds, who before
were too much taken up to mind either a dying bed, or a
vast eternity; but when their days were almost numbered,
when mortality hasted on them, when the revelation of
the righteous judgment was at the door, and that all
their worldly recreations and enjoyments must be parted
with, and that eye for ever shut, and flesh turned to
worm's-meat, that took delight therein; then, O then, was
it the holy witness had room to plead with conscience:
then nothing but a holy, strict, and severe life was valuable;
then all the world for a little time, who before had
given all their time for a little of a vain world. But if so
short a representation of the inconsistency of the vanities
of the world with the Christian life, could make so deep
an impression; oh! to what a noble stature and large
proportion had they been grown in all pious and heavenly[336]
knowledge; and how much greater had their rewards
been if they contentedly had foregone those perishing entertainments
of the world betimes, and given the exercise
of their minds to the tuition and guidance of that universal
grace and Holy Spirit of God, which had so long shined in
darkness, uncomprehended of it, and was at last but just
perceived to give a sight of what they had been doing all
their days.

XVII. Philip III. King of Spain, seriously reflecting
upon the life he had led in the world, cried out upon his
death-bed, "Ah! how happy were I, had I spent these
twenty-three years that I have held my kingdom, in a retirement."
Crying out to his confessor, "My concern is
for my soul, not my body. I lay all that God has given
me, my dominion, power, and my life, at the feet of Jesus
Christ my Saviour." Would kings would live, as well as
die so!

XVIII. Count Gondamor, ambassador in England for
that very king, and held the ablest man of his time,
took great freedom as to his religion in his politics,
serving his ends by those ways that would best accomplish
them. When, towards his latter end, he grew very thoughtful
of his past life, and after all his negotiations and successes
in business, said to one of his friends, "I fear nothing
in the world more than sin;" often professing, he
had rather endure hell than sin: so clear and strong were
his convictions, and so exceeding sinful did sin appear to
him, upon a serious consideration of his ways.

XIX. Cardinal Richelieu, after having been first minister
of state of Europe, as well as of France, confessed to old
Peter de Moulin, the famous Protestant of that country,
that, being forced upon many irregularities by that which
they call reason of state, he could not tell how to satisfy his
conscience for several things, and therefore had many temptations
to doubt and disbelieve a God, another world, and[337]
the immortality of the soul, and thereby to relieve his
mind from any disquiet, but in vain. So strong, he said,
was the notion of God on his soul, so clear the impression
of Him upon the frame of the world, so unanimous the
consent of mankind, so powerful the convictions of his own
conscience, that he could not but taste the power of the
world to come, and so live as one that must die, and so die
as one that must live for ever. And being asked one day
why he was so sad, answered, "Monsieur, Monsieur, the
soul is a serious thing; it must be either sad here for a
moment, or be sad for ever."

XX. Cardinal Mazarin, reputed the most cunning
statesman of his time, and who gave great proofs of it in
the successes of the French crown, under his ministry:
his aim was the grandeur of the world, to which he made
all other considerations submit: but, poor man! he was of
another mind a little before his death: for, being awakened
by the smart lashes of conscience, which represented his
soul's condition very dismal, with astonishment and tears
he cried out, "Oh, my poor soul, what will become of
thee! Whither wilt thou go?" and spake one day thus to
the Queen-mother of France, "Madam, your favours have
undone me. Were I to live again, I would be a Capuchin,
rather than a courtier."

XXI. Count Oxenstiern, chancellor of Sweden, a person
of the first quality, station, and ability in his own country,
and whose share and success, not only in the chief ministry
of affairs in that kingdom, but in the greatest negotiations
of Europe during his time, made him no less
considerable abroad. After all his knowledge and honour,
being visited in his retreat from public business, by commissioner
Whitlock, ambassador from England to Queen
Christiana, in the conclusion of their discourse, he said to
the ambassador, "I have seen much, and enjoyed much
of this world, but I never knew how to live till now. I[338]
thank my good God that has given me time to know Him,
and to know myself. All the comfort I have, and all the
comfort I take, and which is more than the whole world
can give, is feeling the good Spirit of God in my heart,
and reading in this good book," holding up the Bible,
"that came from it." And further addressed himself thus
to the ambassador: "You are now in the prime of your
age and vigour, and in great favour and business; but this
will all leave you, and you will one day better understand
and relish what I say to you; and then you will find that
there is more wisdom, truth, comfort, and pleasure, in retiring
and turning your heart from the world, to the good
Spirit of God, and in reading the Bible, than in all the
courts and favours of princes." This I had, as near as
I am able to remember, from the ambassador's own mouth,
more than once. A very edifying history, when we consider
from whom it came; one of the greatest and wisest
men of his age, while his understanding was as sound and
vigorous, as his experience and knowledge were great.

XXII. Dr. Donne, a great poet, taking his farewell of
his friends, on his dying bed, left this saying behind him,
for them to measure their fancies and their actions by: "I
repent of all my life, but that part of it I spent in communion
with God, and doing good."

XXIII. Selden, one of the greatest scholars and antiquaries
of his time: one who had taken a diligent survey
of what knowledge was considerable amongst the Jews,
Heathens, and Christians; at last professeth this toward the
end of his days, in his conference with Bishop Usher,
that, notwithstanding he had been so laborious in his inquiries,
and curious in his collections, and had possessed
himself of a treasure of books and manuscripts, upon all
ancient subjects; yet he could rest his soul on none,
save the Scriptures, and above all that passage lay most
remarkably upon his spirit, (Titus ii. 11-15,) "For the[339]
grace of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared
unto all men, teaching us, that, denying ungodliness and
worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly
in this present world: looking for that blessed hope,
and glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour
Jesus Christ; who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem
us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar
people, zealous of good works: these things speak,
and exhort, and rebuke with all authority." And indeed
it is one of the most comprehensive passages in the Scripture;
for it comprises the end, means, and recompense of
Christianity.

XXIV. Hugo Grotius, than whom these latter ages
think they have not had a man of more universal knowledge,
"a light," say the statesmen; "a light," say the
churchmen too; witness his Annals, and his Book, De
Jure Belli et Pacis; also his Christian Religion, and elaborate
Commentaries. He winds up his life and choice in
this remarkable saying, which should abate the edge of
other men's inordinate desires after what they falsely call
learning; namely, "I would give all my learning and honour
for the plain integrity of Jean Urick, who was a religious
poor man, that spent eight hours of his time in
prayer, eight in labour, and but eight in meals, sleep, and
other necessaries." And to one that admired his great industry,
he returned this by way of complaint: "Ah! I
have consumed my life in laboriously doing nothing."
And to another, that inquired of his wisdom and learning,
what course to take, he solemnly answered, "Be serious."
Such was the sense he had, how much a serious life excelled,
and was of force towards a dying hour.

XXV. To whom I join Salmasius, that famous French
scholar, and the other's contemporary, who after his many
volumes of learning, by which he had acquired great veneration
among men of books, confessed so far to have mistaken[340]
true learning, and that in which solid happiness
consists, that he exclaimed thus against himself: "Oh!
I have lost a world of time; time, that most precious thing
in the world; whereof, had I but one year more, it should
be spent in David's Psalms, and Paul's Epistles. Oh,
Sirs," said he to those about him, "mind the world less,
and God more: the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and
to depart from evil, that is understanding."

XXVI. Francis Junius, an ingenious person, who hath
written his own life, as he was reading Tully de Legibus,
fell into a persuasion, Nihil curare Deum, nec sui, nec
alieni; till in a tumult in Lyons, the Lord wonderfully delivered
him from imminent death; so that he was forced
to acknowledge a divine Providence therein, and his father
hearing the dangerous ways that his son was misled into,
sent for him home, where he carefully and piously instructed
him, and caused him to read over the New Testament;
of which himself writeth thus: "When I opened
the New Testament, I first lighted upon John's first chapter,
"In the beginning was the word," &amp;c. I read part of
the chapter, and was suddenly convinced, that the divinity
of the argument, and the majesty and authority of the
writing, did exceedingly excel all the eloquence of human
writings: my body trembled, my mind was astonished,
and was so affected all that day, that I knew not where
and what I was. Thou wast mindful of me, O my God,
according to the multitude of thy mercies, and calledst
home thy lost sheep into the fold." And, as Justin Martyr
of old, so he of late professed, that the power of godliness
in a plain simple Christian wrought so upon him, that he
could not but take up a strict and a serious life.

XXVII. A. Rivetus, a man of learning, and much reverenced
in the Dutch nation, after a long life of study, in
search of Divine knowledge, upon his death bed, being
discoursed by his friend of heavenly things, brake forth in[341]
this manner: "God has learned me more of himself in ten
days' sickness, than I could get by all my labour and studies."
So near a way, so short a cut it is to the knowledge
of God, when people come into the right way, which is to
turn, in their minds and hearts, to the voice of God, and
learn of Him, who is a Spirit, to be taught of Him, and led
by Him: For in righteousness such shall be established,
and great shall be their peace.



A Letter from James, Earl of Marlborough, a little before
his Death, in the Battle at Sea, on the Coast of Holland,
&amp;c.

XXVIII. "I believe the goodness of your nature, and
the friendship you have always borne me, will receive with
kindness the last office of your friend. I am in health
enough of body, and, through the mercy of God, in Jesus
Christ, well disposed in mind. This I premise, that you
may be satisfied that what I write proceeds not from any
fantastic terror of mind, but from a sober resolution of
what concerns myself, and earnest desire to do you more
good after my death, than mine example (God of his
mercy pardon the badness of it!) in my lifetime may do
you harm. I will not speak aught of the vanity of this
world; your own age and experience will save that labour:
but there is a certain thing that goeth up and down in
the world, called religion, dressed, and pretended fantastically,
and to purposes bad enough, which yet by such
evil dealings loseth not its being. The great good God
hath not left it without a witness, more or less, sooner or
later, in every man's bosom, to direct us in the pursuit of
it; and for the avoiding those inextricable disquisitions
and entanglements our own frail reasons would perplex us
withal, God in his infinite mercy hath given us his holy
word, in which, as there are many things hard to be understood,[342]
so there is enough plain and easy to quiet our
minds, and direct us concerning our future being. I
confess to God and you, I have been a great neglecter,
and, I fear, despiser of it: God of his infinite mercy
pardon me the dreadful fault! But when I retired myself
from the noise and deceitful vanity of the world, I found
no true comfort in any other resolution than what I had
from thence: I commend, from the bottom of my heart,
the same to your, I hope, happy use. Dear Hugh, let us
be more generous, than to believe we die as the beasts
that perish; but with a christian, manly, brave resolution,
look to what is eternal. I will not trouble you further.
The only great God, and holy God, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, direct you to a happy end of your life, and send us
a joyful resurrection! So prays your true friend,


"Marlborough."


XXIX. The late Sir Henry Vane must be too fresh in
memory to need a character; but it is certain, his parts
were of the first rate, and superior to the generality of
men; but he would often say, he owed them to religion.
In his youth he was much addicted to company, and promised
little to business; but in reading a book, called,
"The Signs of a Godly Man," and being convicted in
himself that they were just, but that he had no share in
any one of them, he fell into that extreme anguish and
horror, that for some days and nights he took little food or
rest, which at once dissolved his old friendships, and made
those impressions and resolutions to religion, that neither
university, courts, princes, nor parents, nor any losses or
disappointments that threatened his new course of life,
could weaken or alter. And though this laid him under
some disadvantages for a time, his great integrity and
abilities quickly broke through that obscurity; so that
those of very differing sentiments did not only admire,[343]
but very often desired him to accept the most eminent
negotiations of his country, which he served according to
his own principles with great success, and a remarkable
self-denial. This great man's maxim was, Religion was
the best master, and the best friend; for it made men
wise, and would never leave them that never left it; which
he found true in himself: for as it made him wiser than
those that had been his teachers, so it made him firmer
than any hero, having something more than nature to
support him: which was the judgment as well of foreigners
as others, that had the curiosity to see him die. Making
good some meditations of his own, viz.: "The day of death
is the judge of all our other days: the very trial and
touch-stone of the actions of our life. It is the end that
crowns the work, and a good death honoureth a man's
whole life. The fading corruption and loss of this life
is the passage into a better. Death is no less essential to
us, than to live or to be born. In flying death, thou fliest
thyself; thy essence is equally parted into these two, life
and death. It is no small reproach to a Christian, whose
faith is in immortality, and the blessedness of another life,
to fear death much, which is the necessary passage thereunto."

XXX. The late earl of Rochester was inferior to nobody
in wit, and hardly anybody ever used it worse, if we believe
him against himself in his dying reflections; an account
of which I have had from some that visited him in his
sickness, besides that larger one, made public by the
Bishop of Salisbury. It was then that he came to think
there was a God, for he felt his lashes on his conscience,
and that there was such a thing as virtue, and a reward
for it. Christianity was no longer a worldly or absurd
design; but Christ, a Saviour, and a most merciful one;
and his doctrines plain, just, and reasonable, and the true
way to felicity here and hereafter. Admiring and adoring[344]
that mercy to him, which he had treated with so much
infidelity and obstinate contempt: wishing only for more
life to confute his past one, and in some measure to repair
the injuries he had done to religion by it; begging forgiveness
for Christ's sake, though he thought himself the
most unworthy of it for his own,&mdash;thus died the witty
Lord Rochester, and this retreat he made from the world
he had so great a name in. May the loose wits of the
times, as he desired, take warning by him, and not leave
their repentance to a dying bed!

XXXI. A noble young man of the family of Howard,
having yielded too much to the temptations of youth,
when upon his sick bed, which proved his dying bed, fell
under the power and agony of great convictions, mightily
bewailing himself in the remembrance of his former extravagancies;
crying strongly to God to forgive him,
abhorring his former course, and promising amendment,
if God renewed life to him. However, he was willing to
die, having tasted of the love and forgiveness of God;
warning his acquaintance and kindred that came to see
him to fear God, and forsake the pleasures and vanity of
this world: and so willingly yielded his soul from the
troubles of time, and frailties of mortality.

XXXII. The late princess Elizabeth of the Rhine of
right claimeth a memorial in this discourse, her virtue
giving greater lustre to her name than her quality, which
yet was of the greatest in the German empire. She
chose a single life, as freest of care, and best suited to the
study and meditation she was always inclined to; and the
chief diversion she took, next to the air, was in some such
plain and housewifely entertainments as knitting, &amp;c. She
had a small territory, which she governed so well, that she
showed herself fit for a greater. She would constantly,
every last day in the week, sit in judgment, and hear and
determine causes herself; where her patience, justice, and[345]
mercy were admirable; frequently remitting her forfeitures,
where the party was poor, or otherwise meritorious.
And what was excellent, though unusual, she would temper
her discourses with religion, and strangely draw concerned
parties to submission and agreement; exercising not so
much the rigour of her power, as the power of her persuasion.
Her meekness and humility appeared to me extraordinary;
she never considered the quality, but the
merit of the people she entertained. Did she hear of a
retired man, hid from the world, and seeking after the
knowledge of a better, she was sure to set him down in
the catalogue of her charity, if he wanted it; I have casually
seen, I believe, fifty tokens sealed and superscribed to
the several poor subjects of her bounty, whose distances
would not suffer them to know one another, though they
knew her, whom yet some of them had never seen. Thus,
though she kept no sumptuous table in her own court, she
spread the tables of the poor in their solitary cells; breaking
bread to virtuous pilgrims, according to their want, and
her ability. Abstemious in herself, and in apparel void of
all vain ornaments.

I must needs say, her mind had a noble prospect; her
eye was to a better and more lasting inheritance than can
be found below: which made her often to despise the
greatness of courts, and learning of the schools, of which she
was an extraordinary judge. Being once at Hamburgh,
a religious person, whom she went to see for religion's
sake, telling her it was too great an honour for him, that
he should have a visitant of her quality come under his
roof, that was allied to so many great kings and princes
of this world, she humbly answered: "If they were godly
as well as great, it would be an honour indeed; but if you
knew what that greatness was as well as I, you would
value less that honour." Being in some agony of spirit,
after a religious meeting we had in her own chamber, she[346]
said, "It is a hard thing to be faithful to what one knows:
Oh, the way is strait! I am afraid I am not weighty enough
in my spirit to walk in it." After another meeting, she
uttered these words: "I have records in my library, that
the Gospel was first brought out of England hither into
Germany, by the English, and now it is come again." She
once withdrew, on purpose to give her servants the liberty
of discoursing with us, that they might the more freely put
what questions of conscience they desired to be satisfied
in; for they were religious: suffering both them, and the
poorest of her town, to sit by her in her own bedchamber,
where we had two meetings. I cannot forget her last
words, when I took my leave of her: "Let me desire you
to remember me, though I live at this distance, and that
you should never see me more: I thank you for this good
time; and know and be assured, though my condition
subjects me to divers temptations, yet my soul hath strong
desires after the best things." She lived her single life till
about sixty years of age, and then departed at her own
house in Herwerden, in the year 1680, as much lamented
as she had lived beloved of the people: to whose real
worth, I do, with a religious gratitude, for her kind reception,
dedicate this memorial.

XXXIII. Bulstrode Whitlock, has left his own character
in his "Memoirs of English affairs;" a book that
shows both his employments and greater abilities. He
was almost ever a commissioner and companion with
those great men that the lords and commons of England,
at several times, appointed to treat with King Charles I.
for a peace. He was commissioner of the great seal, ambassador
to the crown of Sweden, and sometimes president
to the council: a scholar, a lawyer, a statesman; in short,
he was one of the most accomplished men of the age.
Being with him sometimes at his own house in Berkshire,
where he gave me that account I have related of chancellor[347]
Oxenstiern, amongst many serious things he spoke,
this was very observable, "I have ever thought," said he,
"there has been one true religion in the world, and that
is the work of the Spirit of God in the hearts and
souls of men. There have been indeed divers forms and
shapes of things, through the many dispensations of God
to men, answerable to his own wise ends, in reference to
the low and uncertain state of man in the world; but the
old world had the Spirit of God, for it strove with them;
and the new world has had the Spirit of God, both Jew
and Gentile, and it strives with all; and they that have
been led by it, have been the good people in every dispensation
of God to the world. And I myself must say, I have
felt it from a child to convince me of my evil and vanity,
and it has often given me a true measure of this poor world,
and some taste of divine things; and it is my grief I did
not more early apply my soul to it. For I can say, since
my retirement from the greatness and hurries of the world,
I have felt something of the work and comfort of it, and
that it is both ready and able to instruct, and lead and preserve
those that will humbly and sincerely hearken to it.
So that my religion is the good Spirit of God in my heart;
I mean, what that has wrought in me and for me." And
after a meeting at his house, to which he gave an entire
liberty for all that pleased to come, he was so deeply affected
with the testimony of the light, spirit, and grace of
Christ in man, as the gospel dispensation, that after the
meeting closed in prayer, he rose up, and pulled off his hat,
and said, "This is the everlasting gospel I have heard this
day: and I humbly bless the name of God, that He has let
me live to see this day, in which the ancient gospel is
again preached to them that dwell upon the earth."

XXXIV. A sister of the family of Penn, in Buckinghamshire,
a young woman delighting in the finery and
pleasures of the world, was seized with a violent illness[348]
that proved mortal to her. In the time of her sickness she
fell into great distress of soul, bitterly bewailing the want
of that inward peace which makes a death-bed easy to the
righteous. After several days' languishing, a little consolation
appeared after this manner. She was some hours in
a kind of trance; she apprehended she was brought into a
place where Christ was; to whom, could she but deliver
her petition, she hoped to be relieved. But her endeavours
increased her pain: for as she pressed to deliver
it, he turned his back upon her, and would not so much
as look towards her. But that which added to her sorrow,
was, that she beheld others admitted: however, she gave
not over importuning him. And when almost ready to
faint, and her hope to sink, he turned one side of his face
towards her, and reached forth his hand, and received her
request: at which her troubled soul found immediate consolation.
Turning to those about her, she repeats what
had befallen her, adding, "Bring me my new clothes,
take off the lace and finery;" and charged her relations,
not to deck and adorn themselves after the manner of the
world: for that the Lord Jesus, whom she had seen, appeared
unto her in the likeness of a plain countryman,
without any trimming or ornament whatever; and that his
servants ought to be like Him.

XXXV. My own father, after thirty years employment,
with good success, in divers places of eminent trust and
honour in his own country, upon a serious reflection, not
long before his death, spoke to me in this manner: "Son
William, I am weary of the world: I would not live over
my days again, if I could command them with a wish: for
the snares of life are greater than the fears of death. This
troubles me, that I have offended a gracious God, that has
followed me to this day. Oh, have a care of sin: that is
the sting both of life and death. Three things I commend
to you. First, Let nothing in this world tempt you to[349]
wrong your conscience; I charge you, do nothing against
your conscience, so will you keep peace at home, which
will be a feast to you in the day of trouble. Secondly,
Whatever you design to do, lay it justly, and time it seasonably;
for that gives security and dispatch. Lastly, Be
not troubled at disappointments; for if they may be recovered,
do it; if they cannot, trouble is vain. If you
could not have helped it, be content; there is often peace
and profit in submitting to Providence, for afflictions make
wise. If you could have helped it, let not your trouble
exceed instruction for another time: these rules will carry
you with firmness and comfort through this inconstant
world." At another time he inveighed against the profaneness
and impiety of the age; often crying out, with an
earnestness of spirit, "Woe to thee, O England! God will
judge thee, O England! Plagues are at thy door,
O England!" He much bewailed that divers men in
power, and many of the nobility and gentry of the
kingdom, were grown so dissolute and profane; often saying,
"God has forsaken us; we are infatuated; we will shut
our eyes; we will not see our true interests and happiness:
we shall be destroyed!" Apprehending the consequences
of the growing looseness of the age to be our ruin; and
that the methods most fit to serve the kingdom with true
credit, at home and abroad, were too much neglected: the
trouble of which did not a little help to feed his distemper,
which drew him daily nearer to his end: and as he believed
it, so less concerned or disordered, I never saw him at any
time; of which I took good notice: wearied to live, as
well as near to die, he took his leave of us, and of me,
with this expression, and a most composed countenance:
"Son William, if you and your friends keep to your
plain way of preaching, and keep to your plain way
of living, you will make an end of the priests to the
end of the world. Bury me by my mother: live all in[350]
love: shun all manner of evil: and I pray God to bless
you all: and He will bless you."

XXXVI. Anthony Lowther, of Mask, a person of good
sense, of a sweet temper, a just mind, and of a sober education;
when of age to be under his own government, was
drawn by the men of pleasure of the town, into the usual
freedoms of it, and was as much a judge as anybody of
the satisfaction that way of living could yield; but some
time before his sickness, with a free and strong judgment,
he would frequently upbraid himself, and contemn the
world for those unreasonable as well as unchristian liberties
that so much abound in it; which apprehension increased
by the instruction of a long and sharp sickness, he
would often despise their folly, and abhor their guilt;
breathing, with some impatience, after the knowledge of
the best things, and the best company; losing as little time
as he could, that he might redeem the time he had lost;
testifying often, with a lively relish, to the truth of religion,
from the sense he had of it in his own breast: frequently
professing, he knew no joy comparable to that of
being assured of the love and mercy of God; which, as he
often implored with strong convictions, and a deep humility
and reverence, so he had frequently tastes thereof
before his last period; pressing his relations and friends,
in a most serious and affectionate manner, to love God,
and one another more, and this vile world less. And of
this he was so full, it was almost ever the conclusion of his
most inward discourses with his family; though he sometimes
said, he could have been willing to have lived, if
God had pleased, to see his younger children nearer a settlement
in the world; yet he felt no desire to live longer
in the world, but on the terms of living better in it. For
that he did not only think virtue the safest, but the happiest
way of living: commending and commanding it to
his children upon his last blessing.

[351]

I shall conclude this chapter of retired, aged, and dying
persons, with some collections I have made out of the life
of a person of great piety and quality of the French nation.

XXXVII. Du Renti, a young nobleman of France, of
admirable parts, as well as great birth, touched with a sense
of the vanity of the world, and the sweetness of a retired
and religious life, notwithstanding the honours and employments
that waited for him, abandons the pride and
pomp of the world, to enjoy a life of more communion
with God: do but hear him: "I avow," saith he, "that
I have no gust in anything where I find not Jesus Christ;
and for a soul that speaks not of Him, or in which we cannot
taste any effect of grace flowing from his Spirit,
(which is the principle of operations, both inward and outward,
that are solidly Christian,) speak not to me at all of
such an one: could I, as I may say, behold both miracles
and wonders there, and yet not Jesus Christ, nor hear any
talk of Him, I count all but amusement of spirit, loss of time,
and a very dangerous precipice. Let us encourage ourselves
to lead this life unknown, and wholly hid from men,
but most known to and intimate with God; divesting
ourselves, and chasing out of our minds all those many
superfluities, and those many amusements, which bring
with them so great a damage, that they take up our mind,
instead of God. So that when I consider that which
thwarts and cuts into so many pieces this holy, this sweet,
and amiable union, which we should have continually
with God, it appears, that it is only a monsieur, a madame,
a compliment, and chatting, indeed a mere foolery; which
notwithstanding doth ravish and wrest from us the time
that is so precious, and the fellowship that is so holy, and
so desirable. Let us quit this, I pray you, and learn to
court it with our own Master; let us well understand our
part, our own world, as we here phrase it, not that world[352]
I mean, which we do renounce, but that wherein the children
of God do their duties to their Father. There is
nothing in this world so separate from the world, as God;
and the greater the saints are, the greater is their retirement
into Him. This our Saviour taught us whilst He
lived on earth, being in all his visible employments united
to God, and retired into the bosom of his Father. Since
the time that I gave up my liberty to God, as I told you,
I was given to understand to what a state of annihilation
the soul must be brought, to render it capable of union
with Him: I saw my soul reduced into a small point, contracted
and shrunk up to nothing: and at the same time I
beheld myself, as if encompassed with whatsoever the
world loves and possesseth; and, as it were, a hand removing
all this far from me, throwing it into the ocean of
annihilation.

"In the first place, I saw removed all exterior things,
kingdoms, great offices, stately buildings, rich household-stuff,
gold and silver, recreations, pleasures; all which are
great encumbrances to the soul's passing on to God, of
which therefore his pleasure is, that she be stripped, that she
may arrive at the point of nakedness and death, which
will bring her into possession of solid riches and real life.
Assure yourself, there is no security in any state, but this
of dying and annihilation; which is to be baptized into
Christ's death, that we live the life of mortification. Our
best way is therefore to divest ourselves of all, that the
holy child Jesus may govern all. All that can be imagined
in this lower world is of small concernment, though
it were the losing of all our goods, and the death of all the
men in it; this poor ant-hill is not worthy of a serious
thought. Had we but a little faith, and a little love, how
happy should we esteem ourselves in giving away all, to
attend no more, save on God alone; and to say, Deus meus
et omnia; my God, and my all! 'Being,' saith he,[353]
'in a chapel richly wainscotted, and adorned with very
excellent sculpture, and with imagery, I beheld it with
some attention, having had some skill in these things, and
saw the bundles of fleurs-de-luce, and of flowers in the
form of borders, and of very curious workmanship; it was
on a sudden put into my mind, The original of what thou
seest would not detain thee at all in seeing it. And I
perceived, that indeed all these, and those flowers themselves,
not in pictures, would not have taken me up; and
all the ornaments which architecture and art invent are
but things most mean and low, running in a manner only
upon flowers, fruits, branches, harpies, and chimeras, part
whereof are in their very being but things common and low,
and part of them merely imaginary; and yet man, who
croucheth to everything, renders himself amorous and a
slave of them; no otherwise than as if a good workman
should stand to copy out, and counterfeit some trifles and
fopperies. I considered by this sight how poor man was
to be cheated, amused, and diverted from his sovereign
good. And since that time, I could make no more stand
to consider any of these things; and if I did it, I should
reproach myself for it, as no sooner seeing them in churches
or elsewhere, but this presently put upon my spirit. The
original is nothing; the copy and the image is yet less;
each thing is vain, except the employment of ourselves
about God alone. An absolute abnegation will be necessary
to all things, to follow in simplicity, without reserve
or reflection, what our Saviour shall work in us, or appoint
for us, let it be this or that. This way was showed me,
in which I ought to walk towards Him: and hence it is,
that all things to me ordinarily are without any gust or
delight. I assure you, it is a great shame to a Christian
to pass his days in this world more at ease than Jesus
Christ here passed his: ah! had we but a little faith,
what repose could we take out of the cross!'"

[354]

I will conclude his sayings with his dying blessing to
his surviving children.

"I pray God bless you, and may it please Him to bless
you, and to preserve you by his grace from the evil of the
world, that you may have no part therein: and, above all,
my children, that you may live in the fear and love of
God, and yield due obedience to your mother."

Expressions of that weight and moment to the immortal
good of man, that they abundantly prove to all sensible
readers, that the author was a man of an enlightened mind,
and of a soul mortified to the world, and quickened to
some tastes of a supernatural life: let his youth, let his
quality, adorned with so much zeal and piety, so much
self-denial and constancy, become exemplary to those of
worldly quality, who may be the readers of this book.
Some perhaps will hear that truth from the several authors
I have reported, whose names, death, and time have recovered
from the envy of mess that would hardly endure it
from me, if at all from the living. Be it as it will, I shall
abundantly rejoice, if God shall please to make any
part of this discourse effectual to persuade any into the
love of holiness, without which, certain it is, no man shall
see the Lord: but the pure in heart shall behold Him for
ever.

To conclude, I cannot pass this reflection upon what is
observed of the sayings of dying men, and which to me seems
to have great instruction in it, viz.: All men agree, when
they come to die, it is best to be religious; to live a holy,
humble, strict, and self-denying life; retired, solitary, temperate,
and disencumbered of the world. Then loving God
above all, and our neighbours as ourselves, forgiving our
enemies, and praying for them, are solid things, and the
essential part of religion, as the true ground of man's happiness.
Then all sin is exceeding sinful, and yields no
more pleasure: but every inordinate desire is burthensome,[355]
and severely reproved. Then the world, with all the lawful
comforts in it, weighs light against that sense and
judgment, which such men have between the temporal
and the eternal. And since it is thus with dying men,
what instruction is it to the living, whose pretence for the
most part is a perpetual contradiction? O that men
would learn to number their days, that they might apply
their hearts to wisdom! of which, the fear of the Lord is
the true and only beginning. And blessed are they that
fear always, for their feet shall be preserved from the
snares of death.

CHAPTER XXII.



1. Of the way of living among the first Christians.&mdash;2. An exhortation
to all professing Christianity, to embrace the foregoing
reasons and examples.&mdash;3. Plain dealing with such as reject
them.&mdash;4. Their recompenses.&mdash;5. The author is better persuaded
and assured of some: an exhortation to them.&mdash;6. Encouragement
to the children of light to persevere, from a consideration
of the excellency of their reward; the end and triumph
of the Christian conqueror. The whole concluded with a brief
supplication to Almighty God.

THE CONCLUSION.


I. Having finished so many testimonies as my time
would give me leave, in favour of this subject, No Cross,
No Crown; no temperance, no happiness; no virtue, no
reward: no mortification, no glorification: I shall conclude
with a short description of the life and worship of
the Christians, within the first century or hundred years
after Christ: what simplicity, what spirituality, what holy
love and communion, did in that blessed age abound
among them! It is delivered originally by Philo Judæus,
and cited by Eusebius Pamphilius, in his Ecclesiastical history;[78]
that those Christians renounced their substance,
and severed themselves from all the cares of this life; and
forsaking the cities, they lived solitarily in fields and gardens.[357]
They accounted their company who followed the
contrary life of cares and bustles, as unprofitable and
hurtful unto them, to the end that with earnest and fervent
desires, they might imitate them which led this prophetical
and heavenly life&mdash;"In many places," says he,
"this people liveth, for it behoveth as well the Grecians as
the Barbarians, to be partakers of this absolute goodness;
but in Egypt, in every province, they abound: and especially
about Alexandria. From all parts the better sort
withdrew themselves into the soil and place of these worshippers,
as they were called, as a most commodious
place, adjoining to the lake of Mary, in a valley very fit,
both for its security and the temperance of the air. They
are further reported to have had meeting-houses, where the
most part of the day was employed in worshipping God:
that they were great allegorizers of the Scriptures, making
them all figurative; that the external show of words, or the
letter, resembleth the superficies of the body; and the
hidden sense or understanding of the words seem in the
place of the soul; which they contemplate by their beholding
names, as it were, in a glass." That is, their religion
consisted not chiefly in reading the letter, disputing
about it, accepting things in literal constructions, but
in the things declared of the substance itself, bringing
things nearer to the mind, soul, and spirit, and pressing into
a more hidden and heavenly sense; making religion to consist
in the temperance and sanctity of the mind, and not
in the formal bodily worship, so much now-a-days in repute,
fitter to please comedians than Christians. Such
was the practice of those times: but now the case is altered;
people will be Christians, and have their worldly-mindedness
too; but though God's kingdom suffer violence
by such, yet shall they never enter: the life of Christ and
his followers hath in all ages been another thing; and[358]
there is but one way, one guide, one rest; all of which are
pure and holy.

II. But if any, notwithstanding our many sober reasons,
and numerous testimonies from Scripture, or the example
or experience of religious, worldly, and profane living and
dying men at home and abroad, of the greatest note, fame,
and learning in the whole world, shall yet remain lovers
and imitators of the folly and the vanity condemned: if
the cries and groans, sighs and tears, and complaints, and
mournful wishes of so many reputed great, nay, some sober
men; "O that I had more time! O that I might live a year
longer, I would live a stricter life! O that I were a poor
Jean Urick! All is vanity in this world! O my poor
soul! whither wilt thou go? O that I had the time spent
in vain recreations! A serious life is above all:" and such
like. If, I say, this by no means can prevail, but if yet
they shall proceed to folly, and follow the vain world, what
greater evidence can they give of their heady resolution, to
go on impiously to despise God, to disobey his precepts,
to deny Christ, to scorn, not to bear his cross, to forsake
the examples of his servants, to give the lie to
the dying serious sayings and consent of all ages; to harden
themselves against the checks of conscience, to befool and
sport away their precious time, and poor immortal souls to
woe and misery? (Exod. xxxii. 6; Amos, vi. 3-6; Ephes.
iv. 17, 24.) In short, it is plain to discover, you have neither
reason to justify yourselves, nor yet enough of modesty to
blush at your own folly; but as those that have lost the
sense of one and the other, go on to eat and drink, and
rise up to play. (Matt. xix. 16-22.) In vain, therefore, is it
for you to pretend to fear the God of heaven, whose minds
serve the god of the pleasure of this world: in vain is it to
say, you believe in Christ, who receive not his self-denying
doctrine: and to no better purpose will all you do avail.[359]
If he that had loved God and his neighbour, and kept the
commandments from his youth, was excluded from being
a disciple, because he sold not all, and followed Jesus;
with what confidence can you call yourselves Christians,
who have neither kept the commandments, nor yet forsaken
anything to be so? And if it was a bar betwixt him
and the eternal life he sought, that, notwithstanding all his
other virtues, love to money and his external possessions
could not be parted with, what shall be your end, who
cannot deny yourselves many less things, but are daily
multiplying your inventions to please your fleshly appetites?
Certainly, much more impossible is it to forsake
the greater. Christ tried his love, in bidding him forsake
all, because he knew, for all his brags, that his mind was
rivetted therein: not that if he had enjoyed his possessions
with Christian indifferency, they might not have been continued;
but what then is their doom, whose hearts are so
fixed in the vanities of the world, that they will rather
make them Christian, than not to be Christians in the use
of them? But such a Christian this young man might
have been, who had more to say for himself than the strictest
Pharisee living dare pretend to; yet he went away sorrowful
from Jesus. Should I ask you, if Nicodemus did well
to come by night, (John, iii. 1-5,) and be ashamed of the
great Messiah of the world? and if he was not ignorant
when Christ spake to him of the new birth? I know you
will answer me, he did very ill, and was very ignorant; but
stay a while; the beam is in your own eyes: you are ready
doubtless to condemn him, and the young man, for not
doing what you not only refuse to do yourselves, but laugh
at others for doing. Nay, had such passages not been
writ, and were it not for the reverence some pretend for the
Scriptures, they would both be as stupid as Nicodemus in
their answers to such heavenly matters, and ready to call it
canting to speak so, as it is frequent for you, when we[360]
speak to the same effect, though not the same words: just
as the Jews, at what time they called God their Father,
they despised his Son; and when He spake of sublime and
heavenly mysteries, some cried, He has a devil; others,
He is mad; and most of them, These are hard sayings,
who can hear them?

III. And to you all that sport yourselves after the manners
of the world, let me say, that you are of those who
profess you know God, but in works deny Him; living in
those pleasures which slay the just in yourselves. (Tit. i. 16.)
For though you talk of believing, it is no more than taking
it for granted that there is a God, a Christ, Scriptures, &amp;c.
without further concerning yourselves to prove the verity
thereof to yourselves or others, by a strict and holy conversation:
which slight way of believing is but a light
and careless way of ridding yourselves of further examination;
and rather throwing them off with an inconsiderate
granting of them to be so, than giving yourselves the trouble
of making better inquiry, leaving that to your priests,
ofttimes more ignorant, and not less vain and idle than yourselves,
which is so far from a gospel faith, that it is the least
respect you can show to God, Scriptures, &amp;c. and next to
which kind of believing, is nothing, under a denial of all.

But if you have hitherto laid aside all temperance, reason,
and shame, at least be entreated to resume them now
on a matter of this importance, and whereon no less concernment
rests, than your temporal and eternal happiness.
Oh, retire, retire; observe the reproofs of instruction in your
own minds: that which begets sadness in the midst of
mirth, which cannot solace itself, nor be contented below
immortality, which calls often to an account at nights,
mornings, and other seasons: which lets you see the vanity,
the folly, the end and misery of these things; this is the
just principle and holy Spirit of the Almighty within you:
hear Him, obey Him: converse with them who are led by[361]
Him, and let the glories of another world be eyed, and the
heavenly recompense of reward kept in sight. Admit not
the thoughts of former follies to revive; but be steady, and
continually exercised by his grace, to deny ungodliness
and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and
godly in this present world: (Tit. ii. 12:) for this is the
true and heavenly nature of Christianity, to be so awakened
and guided by the Spirit and grace of God, as to leave the
sins and vanities of the world, and to have the affections
regenerated, the mind reformed, and the whole man so baptised
into purity and faithfulness towards God and man;
as to act with reverence, justice, and mercy: to care for
very few things; to be content with what you have: to use
all as if you used them not; and to be so disentangled
from the lusts, pleasures, profits, and honours of the world,
as to have the mind raised to things above, the heart
and affections fixed there: that in all things you
may glorify God, and be as lights set on a hill, whose
shining examples may be conducing to the happiness of
others, who, beholding such good works, may be converted,
and glorify God the Father of lights, in whom you all
would be eternally blessed.

IV. But if the impenitence of any is so great, their pursuit
of folly so earnest, and notwithstanding what has been
thus seriously offered to reclaim them, they are resolved to
take their course, and not to be at leisure for more divine
things, I have this further to leave with them from the
Almighty, who first called me to this work: that tribulation,
anguish, and sorrow, (Rom. ii. 4, 5, 6, 9,) shall make their
dying beds; indignation and wrath shall wind up their
days, and trouble and vexation of mind and spirit shall be
the miserable fruits which they shall reap, as the reward of
all their wretched folly and rebellion! Be not deceived,
God will not be mocked: (Gal. vi. 4-8,) it is so irreversibly
decreed, Whatever is sown here, shall be reaped hereafter.[362]
And just is the Almighty, to make good his determinations
upon such, who, instead of employing the time given them
to work out their salvation with fear and trembling, have
spent it in the pleasures of the flesh, which perish; as if
their heaven were here. Nor can it seem unreasonable,
since He hath thus long waited with remission of sins, and
eternal life in his hand, to distribute to them that repent:
that if such will not, to recompense so great obstinacy and
love of this perishing world, with everlasting tribulation.
(Rev. iii. 20, xxi. 27, xxii. 13-15.)

V. But I am otherwise persuaded of many: yes, I am
assured the mercies of the everlasting God have been so
extended to many, that this will prove an effectual call to
bring them out of the ways and customs of this corrupted
and corrupting world; and a means of establishing such,
who hitherto have been unfaithful to what they have been
already convinced of. And you, my friends, whose minds
have received the alarm, whose hearts have truly heard the
voice of one crying in the wilderness, where you have
been straying from the Lord, Repent! repent! To you,
in the name of the great and living God, I speak, I cry,
Come away, come away: ah! what do you do there?
Why are you yet behind? That is not your rest; it is
polluted with the sins and vanities of a perishing world:
gird up your loins: eye your light, one in all, Christ
Jesus, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever: who hath
enlightened every one: (John, i. 9:) follow Him, He will
lead you to the city of God, that has foundations, into
which the wicked cannot enter.

VI. Mind not the difficulties of your march; great and
good things were never enterprised and accomplished
without difficulty, which does but render their enjoyment
more pleasant and glorious in the end. Let the holy men
and women of old be your examples: remember good old
Abraham, (Gen. xii. 1, 2,) the excellency of whose faith[363]
is set out by his obedience to the voice of God, in forsaking
his father's house, kindred, country, &amp;c. And
Moses, that might in probability have been made a king,
by faith in God leaves Egypt's glory and Pharaoh's
favours, and chooses rather a sojourn and pilgrimage with
the despised, afflicted, tormented Israelites in the wilderness,
than to enjoy the pleasures of that great court for a
season; esteeming Christ's reproaches greater riches than
Egypt's treasures. (Heb. xi. 24-27; Isaiah, liv. 3.) But
above all, how great was the reproach, how many the
sufferings, how bitter the mockings, which Jesus suffered
at the hands of his enemies! Yet with what patience,
meekness, forgiveness, and constancy, did He in all his
actions, demean himself towards his bloody persecutors,
despising the shame, enduring the cross, for the joy that
was set before him! (Heb. xii. 12.) And hath left us
this glorious example, that we should follow his steps;
(1 Peter, ii. 22, 23;) which hath in almost every age been
imitated by some. The apostles sealed their testimonies
with their blood, and multitudes after the example of their
constancy, esteeming it the greatest honour, as it was
always attended with the signal demonstration of the
Divine presence. How memorable was that of Origen:
"If my father were weeping upon his knees before me, and
my mother hanging about my neck behind me, and all my
brethren, sisters, and kinsfolk lamenting on every side, to
retain me in the life and practice of the world, I would
fling my mother to the ground, run over my father, despise
all my kindred, and tread them under my feet, that I
might run to Christ." Yet it is not unknown, how dutiful
and tender he was in those relations. Not much unlike to
this was that noble and known instance of latter times, in
Galeacius Carraciolus, marquis of Vico, who abandoned
his friends, estate, and country, resolutely saying with
Moses, that he would rather suffer afflictions with the first[364]
reformers and Protestants, than enjoy his former plenty,
favours, and pleasures, with his old religion. (2 Tim. iii. 12;
1 Peter, iv. 1-5.) Nor is it possible for any now to quit the
world, and live a serious, godly life in Christ, without the
like suffering and persecution. There are among us also
some who have suffered the displeasure of their most dear
and intimate relations and friends; and all those troubles,
disgraces, and reproaches, which are accustomed to attend
such as decline the honours, pleasures, ambition, and preferments
of the world, and that choose to live a humble,
serious, and self-denying life before the Lord: but they
are very unequal to the joy and recompense that follow.
For though there be no affliction that is not grievous for
the present, yet, what says the man of God? it works a
far more exceeding weight of glory in the end. This has
been both the faith and experience of those, that in all
ages have trusted in God, who have not fainted by the
way; but enduring, have obtained an eternal diadem.

Wherefore, since we are compassed about with so great
a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and burden,
and the sin and vanities that do so easily beset us,
and with a constant holy patience run our race, having our
eye fixed upon Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith,
not minding what is behind; (Heb. xii. 1; Rom. v. 1-4;)
so shall we be delivered from every snare. No temptations
shall gain us, no frowns shall scare us from Christ's cross,
and our blessed self-denial. (Phil. iii. 13; Rom. ii. 7.) And
honour, glory, immortality, and a crown of eternal life
shall recompense all our sufferings in the end.



O Lord God! thou lovest holiness, and purity is thy
delight in the earth; wherefore I pray thee, make an
end of sin, and finish transgression, and bring in thy[365]
everlasting righteousness to the souls of men, that thy
poor creation may be delivered from the bondage it groans
under, and the earth enjoy her sabbath again: that thy
great Name may be lifted up in all nations, and thy salvation
renowned to the ends of the world. For thine is the
kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
