<p class="drop-cap">A REMARKABLE example of
the human-like intelligence of a
chimpanzee, rivaling that of the
celebrated "Mr. Crowley," of
New York, so long the chief object of
admiration in the museum of Central
Park, was that of the subject of this
sketch. "Tess" was captured in Africa
by Allan Grosch and brought to Boston,
where she was purchased by Frank
C. Bostock. She was brought up with
Mr. Bostock's little girl and was dressed
the same as any child of three years.
She walked upright, ate with knife and
fork, drank from a cup, had better
table manners than the average child
of the same age, wore finger-rings, ear-rings,
and pin, and always surveyed herself
in the glass to see that her pin was
on straight, and her dress hung right;
she smoked a pipe, drew lines on a
blackboard, wrote with a pen, and
imitated Mr. Bostock's little girl in
many ways. She uttered a few sounds
which were understood by her master,
and seemed to understand what was
said to her. She died of pneumonia
while being exhibited in the East, was
purchased by Mr. C. F. Gunther and
presented by him to the Chicago Academy
of Sciences. Her age was three
years and seven months.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee (<i>Simia troglodytes</i>)
is considerably smaller than the gorilla;
old males reach a height of sixty-four
inches; females, forty-eight inches.
The arms are long, reaching a little below
the knee, and possess great muscular
power. In the feet the large toe
is separated from the others by a deep
incision; and the sole is flat. The hair
of the chimpanzee is smooth, the color
usually black, but in some specimens it
is a dull, reddish brown. Chimpanzees
walk on all fours, resting themselves on
the calloused backs of their hands.
The toes of the feet are sometimes
drawn in when walking. Naturalists
say there is a strong inclination in this
species to show remarkably varying individual
types, which has led to controversies
as to whether there were not
several different species.</p>

<p>That the chimpanzee was known to
the ancients is made fairly certain
by the famous mosaic picture which
once adorned the temple of Fortuna,
and which is said to be still preserved
in the Barberini palace at Palestrina in
Italy. This mosaic represents, among
many other animals of the Upper Nile
country, what is believed to have been
the chimpanzee. A young specimen
was taken to Europe in the beginning
of the seventeenth century. They have
been taken there repeatedly since and
are not infrequent features of the
European animal market. Several have
been brought to the United States and
placed in museums and menageries.</p>

<p>It was formerly believed that the
chimpanzee was a gregarious animal, but
it is now known that there are seldom
more than five, or, at the utmost, ten
living together. Sometimes, however,
they gather in greater numbers for play.
One observer claims to have seen at
one time about fifty of them which had
assembled on trees and amused themselves
with screaming and drumming
on the tree trunks. They shun human
habitation. Their nests are built in
trees, not at a great height from the
ground. They break and twist and
cross larger and smaller branches and
support the whole on a strong bough.
A nest will sometimes be found at the
end of a bough, twenty or thirty feet
from the ground. They change abiding
places often in looking for food or
for other reasons. Two or more nests
are rarely seen in the same tree. Nests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
properly so-called, consisting of inter-woven
branches, as Du Chaillu describes,
have not been seen by any of the other
narrators.</p>

<p>When in repose the chimpanzee in
the wild state usually assumes a sitting
posture. He is often seen sitting or
standing, but it is said the minute he is
detected he drops on all fours and flees.
He is an adept at climbing. In his play
he swings himself from tree to tree and
jumps with amazing agility. His food
consists of fruits, nuts, buds, etc.</p>

<p>While "Tess" was remarkably intelligent
she was too young to show the
maturity of one in Nills' Zoological
Garden in Stuttgart, an account of which
is given by the celebrated painter
of animals, F. Specht. This chimpanzee
could laugh like a human being.
He took notice of this, for no other animal
can show its joy by loud laughter.
When he would take the sympathetic
fellow under the arms, throw him in the
air and catch him, the cage rang with
his merry peals of laughter. One day
he took along a piece of chalk and sat
down on a chair. In a moment the
chimpanzee was sitting on Specht's
knees awaiting further developments.
He put the chalk in the animal's hand,
and leading it, drew several figures on
the wall. When he released the chimpanzee's
hand, the animal started to
shade the drawings with such diligence
that they soon disappeared, to the great
amusement of the spectators.</p>

<p>There are now, or were a few years
ago, two chimpanzees in the Stuttgart
zoological garden, which are the closest
of friends. The female had been
there before and when the male arrived
his box was put over night in her warm,
roomy cage the presentation being intended
for the morrow. When the box,
which, by the way, had been upholstered,
was opened and the male got out, they
both stood on their hind legs for a
few minutes earnestly gazing at each
other. Then they flew into each other's
embrace and exchanged hearty and repeated
kisses; and the female brought
her blanket, spread it on the floor, sat
down on it and by gestures invited the
male to do likewise. It made a charming
picture to see these two taking
their meals at a table. They both used
spoons and did not in the least interfere
with each other. The female had
the peculiarity of cautiously taking the
male's glass, and drinking a goodly portion
out of that, too, after which she
returned it. Both of these animals
laughed heartily when at play.</p>

<p>Barnum, the American showman, had
two chimpanzees, "Nip" and "Tuck," on
exhibition in various cities and towns,
but they did not display much intelligence,
nor did they live long. Other
attempts to introduce the chimpanzee
have not been encouraging. The experiment
of keeping one has not been
tried in the South, however, where there
are doubtless cities whose climatic condition
would prove to be favorable for
keeping chimpanzees much longer
than is possible in the more northern
zoological collections.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE tongue is said to be the
stomach begun. It is the first
organ of the digestive system
which acts upon the food. It is
the source of much of the pleasure of
life, particularly to young people. As
it stands at the entrance to the alimentary
canal it is endowed with powers of
detecting the qualities of whatever the
hands present to the stomach.</p>

<p>In early life the system demands
abundant supplies of good material to
build up growth and maintain activity.
The sense of taste is then peculiarly
keen, and the appetite for good
things is strong. After maturity the desires
become less and one has not so
much pleasure in eating unless by active
labor or from some other cause the
digestive organs are kept in a robust
condition.</p>

<p>With the years the tastes change.
We wonder how children can possibly
eat such quantities in such combination.
The food which fairly delighted us long
ago has little or no attraction for us,
and with many adults there is need for
strong seasoning and condiments which
children avoid.</p>

<p>The child clamors for sweets. The
adult is inclined to check the child in
eating that which would not digest in
the adult's stomach. But Herbert
Spencer won the hearty esteem of the
youngster when he gave scientific argument
showing that growing children
need highly concentrated foods to
meet the demands of nature, and they
may be permitted, in fact encouraged,
to eat freely of foods which are unsuited
to mature people.</p>

<p>The tongue's special work is telling
us whether a given substance is
good for us. Like other senses it may
be deceived and is not always to be relied
upon. And when it has told us
once correctly we may make a serious
mistake in following its advice too extensively
so as to learn that too much
of a good thing is not all good.</p>

<p>Nearly all substances have taste.
That is, the tongue has power to tell us
something about almost every substance
in nature. Water is about the
only substance found in nature that has
no taste. But we rarely find water that
is pure enough to be entirely without
taste. Nearly all solids that can be
dissolved in water have taste. So have
nearly all liquids. When we say that
water tastes good we recognize the
mineral in it, or some combination of
minerals that the human body needs
in its economy.</p>

<p>The substances that the taste recognizes
most readily are common salt,
vinegar, quinine, pepper, and alcohol.
Those least exciting to the tongue are
starch, white of egg, and gum.</p>

<p>The tongue does its work by means
of three sorts of papillæ which cover
its surface. There are many very fine
ones all over the tongue, but these are
most numerous near the tip. Some
larger ones which are not so pointed in
form are also more plentiful near the
tip of the tongue. And there are from
eight to fifteen much larger still that
are arranged in rows like the letter V
at the base of the tongue.</p>

<p>Bitter is tasted mainly at the back of
the tongue. Sweet is tasted all along,
but is most delightful at the base of the
tongue, and it is by this cunning arrangement
that nature gets the tongue
to pass the sweet morsel along to the
throat where it is seized and hurried
downward by the act of swallowing.</p>

<p>These papillæ have within them capillary
blood vessels and the filaments
of nerves. They are the seat of the
tongue's sensibility. Whatever is tasted
must come into chemical action over
these little points. Moderate pressure
helps the sensation, so we smack our
tongues sometimes when we are not in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
company. Cold deadens taste to some
extent and heat acts in nearly the same
way. Rinse the mouth with very warm
or very cold water and then take in a
solution of quinine at about forty degrees
temperature and the bitter fluid
will have almost no bitterness till the
temperature of the mouth and its contents
becomes somewhere near one hundred
degrees.</p>

<p>Three things are necessary in a substance
in order that it may be tasted,
and it is curious to note how common
are all three. First, it must be easily
mixed with the saliva; second, it must
easily spread itself about so that it may
mingle with the mucus that always
covers the papillæ; and third, it
must be capable of acting chemically
on the protoplasm of the end organs
when once it gets into the taste bulb.
All tasteless substances have one or
more of these qualities lacking. Wipe
the tongue dry and place a sugar crystal
upon it. No taste will be experienced
until the spot is moistened.</p>

<p>All substances do not taste alike to
different tongues. We have noted the
difference in appreciation of certain
foods in infancy and in mature years.
Water tastes differently to the fever patient
and to the well man. As substances
taste differently at different
times to the same person, so they vary
with individuals. One tongue is found
on careful examination to have three
times as many papillæ as another, one
system is more susceptible to chemical
action than another, and the nervous
system varies enough in different subjects
to make a considerable difference
in the powers of taste.</p>

<p>One guest at table is delighted with
a dish which appeals not at all to the
palate of his neighbor. In fact there
are cases where the power of taste has
been temporarily or entirely lost. In
such cases the patient goes on with
his daily eating in a mechanical way,
not because it tastes good, but because
he must.</p>

<p>There seem to be different nerves for
sweet, for bitter, for salty things, and
for acids. Substances are known to
chemistry which act differently on the
nerves of the front and those of the
back of the tongue. They very curiously
taste sweet to the nerves of the
tip of the tongue and at the same instant
bitter to those at the base. If
leaves of the <i>Gymnema sylvestre</i> be
chewed, sweet and bitter things are
tasteless for awhile although acids and
salts are tasted as usual.</p>

<p>Let an electric current pass through
the tongue from the tip to the
root and a sour taste will be experienced
at the tip. But no one has yet
explained why when the same sort of
current is passed through in the opposite
direction the taste is alkaline.</p>

<p>Place a small piece of zinc under the
tongue and a dime on top. The saliva
which moistens them will cause them
to form a small galvanic battery. As
they are allowed to touch each other
at the tip of the tongue a sour taste will
be experienced and in the dark a spark
will appear to the eyes.</p>

<p>There is a pretty microscopic formation
on the sides of some of the papillæ.
It consists of rows of small openings or
sacs egg-shaped with very minute
mouths at the surface. These are
known to science as taste bulbs. They
are so small that three hundred of
them put together the long way will
scarcely reach one inch. They are so
numerous that 1,760 have been counted
on one papilla of an ox's tongue. They
are not entirely confined to the surface
of the tongue, for they have been found
in large numbers upon the soft palate
and the uvula, and many have been
discovered on the back side of the
throat and down into the voice box,
some of them even appearing upon the
vocal cords. Their form is much like
that of a long musk melon, but they
are too small to be seen by the naked
eye. The outer part or rind consists of
rows of cells evidently formed to hold
what is within. On the inside are from
five to ten taste cells which are long
enough to reach the whole length of
the bulb and protrude slightly at the
opening where they are finely pointed.
They are attached at the other end and
branch out as if to run to several extremely
fine divisions of the nerves.</p>

<p>Birds and reptiles have no taste bulbs
in their papillæ. Tadpoles and freshwater
fishes have similar bulbs in their
skin, and it is thought they enjoy the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
taste of things around them without the
necessity of taking them in at the
mouth.</p>

<p>We give the sense of taste more
credit sometimes than it merits. What
we regard as tastes are often flavors or
only smells. What is taken in at the
mouth gets to the nose by the back
way if it is of the nature of most spices,
and so by use of the nose and the imagination
we taste things that do not
affect the tongue at all. A cold in the
head shows us we do not taste cinnamon,
we merely experience its pungency
as it smarts the tongue while its
flavor we enjoy only with the nose.</p>

<p>With some substances we have a
mixed experience that passes for taste,
but it is really a combination of taste,
smell, and touch. With the nostrils
held one can scarcely distinguish between
small quantities of pure water
and the same with a very little essence
of cloves. The difference is easily observed
with the nostrils open or after
swallowing, for the odor of the mixture
gets readily into the nose from
either direction.</p>

<p>It is curious to note that, although
there are so many varieties of taste,
man has but few words to describe
them with. We know the taste of a
thousand substances, and yet we are in
nowise superior to the veriest savage
in the matter of speaking about their
flavors. We are obliged to speak in
the same manner as the wild man of
the forest and say that a given taste is
like the taste of some other thing, only
different.</p>

<p>One of the lowest forms of tongues
is that of the gasteropod. All snails
and slugs are gasteropods. They have
instead of a regular tongue a strip that
is called a lingual ribbon, one end of
which is free and the other fastened to
the floor of the mouth. Across the
ribbon from left to right run rows of
hard projections almost like teeth.
Whatever the mouth comes against is
tested for food qualities by this rasping
ribbon which files away at the substance
and wears away not only what
it works upon but the ribbon itself.
This loss of tongue is no serious affair
to the gasteropod, for he finds his
tongue growing constantly like a finger-nail
and he needs to work diligently at
his trade or suffer from undue proportions
of the unruly member. Snails in
an aquarium gnaw the green slime
from the sides of the vessel with their
lingual ribbons, and the process may be
seen to more or less advantage at
times.</p>

<p>Taste is not all confined to tongues.
Some people have papillæ on the inside
of the cheek. Medusae (Jelly
Fish) have no tongues, but the qualities
of the sea-water are noted by them.
As soon as rain begins to fall into the
sea they proceed directly towards the
bottom, showing a decided aversion to
having their water thinned in any way.</p>

<p>Leeches show their powers of distinguishing
tastes when they take in
sweetened water quite freely, but suck
at the skin of a sick man much less
than at that of one in good health.</p>

<p>Taste in insects has its probable seat
in many instances in a pair of short
horns or feelers back of the antennæ.
These are constantly moving over the
parts of that which the insect is feeding
upon, and so apparently enjoyable
is the motion of them that many scientists
have concluded that these are the
taste organs of the insects having them.
At the same time it is quite probable
that in all insects furnished with salivary
glands, a proboscis, or a tongue,
the power of taste is also or exclusively
there.</p>

<p>Fishes seem to do most of their tasting
somewhere down in the stomach,
for they pursue their prey voraciously
and frequently swallow it whole. With
their gristly gums, in many cases
almost of the toughness of leather,
there can be but little sensation of
taste. Their equally hard tongues,
many times fairly bristling with teeth
constructed for capturing, but not for
chewing, cannot possibly afford much
of a taste of what is going down the
throat with the rushing water passing
through the open mouth and gills.</p>

<p>Serpents which swallow their food
alive can get but little taste of their
victims as they pass over the tongue,
although they are deliberate in the act
and cover them with a profusion of
saliva.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that cattle in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
chewing the cud get the highest enjoyment
possible from this sense. They
enjoy their food at the first grasp of it,
and prove it by their persistence in
struggling for certain roots and grasses,
but their calm delight afterwards as
they lie in the shade and bring up
from the recesses of their separate
stomachs the choice and somewhat
seasoned pellets of their morning's
gleanings is an indication of their refined
enjoyment of the pleasures of
this sense.</p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock calls attention to
the remarkable instances of certain insects
in which the foods of the perfect
insect and of the larvæ are quite different.
The mother has to find and
select for her offspring food which she
would not herself touch. "Thus while
butterflies and moths feed on honey,
each species selects some particular
food plant for the larvæ. Again flies,
which also enjoy honey themselves, lay
their eggs on putrid meat and other
decaying animal substances."</p>

<p>Forel seems to have found that certain
insects smell with their antennæ,
but do not taste with them. He gave
his ants honey mixed with strychnine
and morphine. The smell of the honey
attracted them and they followed what
seemed to be the bidding of their antennæ,
but the instant the honey with
its medication touched their lips they
abandoned the stuff.</p>

<p>Will fed wasps with crystals of
sugar till they came regularly for it.
Then he substituted grains of alum for
the sugar. They came and began their
feast as usual, but soon their sense of
taste told them there was some mistake
and they retired vigorously
rubbing their mouth parts to take
away the puckering sensation of the
alum.</p>

<p>Cigar smokers who really enjoy the
weed confess that they cannot tell except
by sight when the cigar goes out.
In the dark they keep right on drawing
air through the cigar, and the
pleasure of the smoke seems to be in
nowise diminished after the cigar is out
unless the smoker discovers he has no
light. This seems to show that the
sense of taste has little to do with the
pleasure of smoking.</p>

<p>Tongues are used in tasting, seizing
food, assisting the teeth to chew, covering
the food with saliva, swallowing,
and talking. Man and the monkey,
having hands to grasp food, do not
use their tongues for this purpose.
The giraffe does so much reaching
and straining after food in the branches
of trees that his tongue has become by
long practice a deft instrument for
grasping. The woodpecker uses his
tongue as a spear, and the anteater
runs his long tongue into the nest of a
colony of ants, so as to catch large
numbers of the little insects on its
sticky surface.</p>

<p>Cats and their kind have a peculiarity
in that instead of having cone-shaped
papillæ their tongues are
covered with sharp spines of great
strength. These are used in combing
the fur and in scraping bones.</p>

<p>Two characteristic accomplishments
of man would not be his if it were not
for his versatile tongue; they are spitting
and whistling. The drawing of
milk in nursing is an act of the tongue,
and the power of its muscles as well
as the complete control of its movements
is an interesting provision of
nature. It is believed by some that
the pleasures of the taste sense are
confined to such animals as suckle
their young.</p>

<p>Tongues are rough because the
papillæ, which in ordinary skin are
hidden beneath the surface, come quite
through and stand up like the villi of
the digestive canal. The red color of
the tongue is due to the fact that the
papillæ are so thinly covered that
the blood circulating within shows
through.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MOUNTAIN_LION" id="THE_MOUNTAIN_LION"></a>THE MOUNTAIN LION.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="58" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS is only one of the names by
which the puma (<i>Felis concolor</i>)
is known in the United States.
He has different local names,
such as tiger, cougar, catamount and
panther, or "painter," as the backwoodsmen
entitle him, and silvery lion.</p>

<p>The puma ranges the whole of both
the Americas from the Straits of Magellan
to where the increasing cold
in the north of Canada blocks his passage.
Like many other large animals,
however, the puma has retired before
the advance of civilization, and in many
of the more thickly populated portions
of the United States a straggler, even,
is rarely to be found.</p>

<p>The haunts of the puma depend upon
the nature of the country. In sections
well-wooded he decidedly prefers forests
to plains; but his favorite spots are
edges of forests and plains grown with
very high grass. He always selects for
his abode such spots as afford some
shelter, in the vicinity of rocks which
have caverns for secure concealment,
and in which to bring forth his young.
He spends the day sleeping on trees, in
bushes, or in the high grass; in the
evening and at night he goes forth to
hunt. He sometimes covers great distances
in a single night, and sportsmen
do not always find him near the place
where he struck down his prey.</p>

<p>All smaller, weak mammals are his
prey&mdash;deer, sheep, colts, calves, and
small quadrupeds generally. When,
however, his prey is so large that it
cannot all be devoured at one meal, the
animal covers it with leaves or buries it
in the earth, returning later to finish his
repast. This habit is sometimes taken
advantage of by his human enemy, who,
poisoning the hidden carcass with
strychnine, often manages to secure the
lion when he comes back to eat it.
The use of poison against these and
other carnivorous animals by the farmer
and stock-raiser has become so general
in the West they are rapidly becoming
exterminated. If it were not for
some such means of defense as this, the
sheep-raisers and cattle-growers would
be quite powerless to protect their herds
from the attacks of the mountain lion
and other beasts of prey.</p>

<p>The puma is a very bloodthirsty animal,
and whether hungry or not, usually
attacks every animal, excepting dogs,
that comes in his way. When hungry,
however, he disdains no sort of food,
feeding even upon the porcupine, notwithstanding
the quills which lacerate
his mouth and face, or the skunk, heedless
of that little animal's peculiar
venom. Ordinarily the puma will not
attack man, fleeing, indeed, from him
when surprised, but he has been known
when emboldened by hunger to make
such attacks. He, of course, sometimes
kills the hunter who has wounded him,
though even then, by the cautious, he
is little feared; but an unprovoked assault,
such as the mangling of a woman
in Pennsylvania in the eighties, is rare.</p>

<p>It is the habit of the puma to spring
upon his prey from an eminence such
as a ledge of rocks, a tree, or a slight rise
of ground. If he fails to strike his victim,
he seldom pursues it for any considerable
distance. In northern regions,
however, he sometimes pursues the
deer when they are almost helpless in
the deep snow. When he has seized
his victim, he tears open its neck, and
laps its blood before he begins to eat.
He devours every part of a small animal,
but the larger ones he eats only in
part&mdash;the head, neck, and shoulders&mdash;burying
the rest.</p>

<p>Very young cubs when captured soon
become thoroughly tamed, enjoying the
liberty of a house like a dog. When
petted they purr like cats and manifest
their affection in much the same manner.
When displeased they growl, but
a roar has never been heard from them.
There is one drawback to a tame puma,
however, says Brehm. When he has
great affection for his master and likes
to play with him, he hides at his approach
and unexpectedly jumps on him.
One can imagine how startling and uncomfortable
would be such an ill-timed
caress. An old puma, when captured,
sometimes rejects all food, preferring
starvation to the loss of liberty.</p>

<p>Every movement of the puma is full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of grace and vigor; he is said to make
leaps of eighteen feet or more. His
sight is keenest in the dusk and by
night; his sense of smell is deficient but
his hearing is extremely acute.</p>

<p>The lair in which the female brings
forth her young is usually in a shallow
cavern on the face of some inaccessible
cliff or ledge of rocks.</p>

<p>In the southern states, Audubon says,
where there are no caves or rocks, the
lair of the puma is generally in a very
dense thicket or in a canebrake. It is
a rude sort of bed of sticks, weeds,
leaves and grasses. The number of
cubs is from two to five. In captivity
two usually are born, but sometimes
only one.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE lemon is the fruit of a small
tree from ten to fifteen feet high.
It is not particularly beautiful,
being rather shrubby in its appearance.
It is an evergreen, bearing
leaves, flowers, and fruit all the year
round. The flowers occur singly in
the axils of the leaves. The calyx is
persistent, that is, it does not drop off
like the corolla, and may be found attached
to the base of the fruit. The
corolla consists of five spreading petals
of a purplish-pink color.</p>

<p>The lemons of the market are from
cultivated plants of which there is a
large number of varieties. These cultivated
varieties or forms took their
origin from the wild lemon trees
native in northern India, in the mountain
forests of the southern Himalayas,
in Kumoan, and Sikkim.</p>

<p>Lemons have been known for a long
time. They were brought to the notice
of the Greeks during the invasion of
Alexander the Great into Media where
the golden-yellow fruit attracted the
attention of the warriors who gave
them the name of Median apples
(<i>Mala medica</i>). Later, Greek warriors
also found this fruit in Persia, and
hence named it Persian apples (<i>Mala
persica</i>). The eminent Greek philosopher
and naturalist Theophrastus, 390
B. C., described the fruit as inedible,
though endowed with a fragrant odor,
and having the power to keep away insects.
On account of this latter property
the so-called Median apple was, by
some, supposed to be identical with the
fruit of the cedar (<i>Kedros</i>) and therefore
received the name "<i>Citrus</i>" from
which is derived "citrone," the German
name, and "citronnier," the
French name for the fruit. Our word
lemon is said to have been derived
from the Indian word <i>limu</i> and the
Arabian word <i>limun</i>. It seems that at
the time of the great Roman historian
and naturalist, Pliny (23-79 A. D.), the
lemon was not yet extensively cultivated.
Dioscarides (50 A. D.) speaks
highly of the medicinal virtues of the
bitter and acrid wild-growing lemon.
Cælius Aurelianus recommends lemon
juice in gout and fevers. In 150 A. D.,
the lemon tree, evidently introduced,
was found growing about Naples and
in Sardinia, but the fruit was still inedible.
About the third century cultivation
had so far improved the fruit that
it could be eaten.</p>

<p>The Arabians are credited with first
having introduced the lemon tree into
southern Europe. The noted Arabian
geographer, Edrisi, twelfth century,
describes the lemon as very sour and
about the size of an apple and the
plant as growing only in India. This
latter statement is, however, erroneous
as the lemon had already been extensively
cultivated in southern and eastern
Spain, where it was introduced by
the agriculturally-inclined Moors. It
has been cultivated for many centuries
in nearly all of the countries bordering
on the Mediterranean Sea and is now also
extensively cultivated in the tropical
and sub-tropical countries and islands
of the Western Hemisphere. One variety
or species, (<i>Citrus lemetta</i>), is a
native of the East Indies and is extensively
cultivated in the West Indies.
Lemon trees are found everywhere in
the larger green houses and conservatories
along with the closely related
orange (<i>Citrus vulgaris</i>.)</p>

<p>As the result of cultivation there are
now about fifty varieties of lemons in
existence. Some of these are comparatively
sweet or rather insipid and are
therefore known as sweet lemons.
The sour varieties are, however, more
generally cultivated. Lest I forget I
will here state that the lemon is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
identical, though closely related, with
the Citron, the fruit of the <i>Citrus
medica</i>.</p>

<p>As above stated the lemon tree
bears fruit all the year round so that a
number of crops are gathered annually.
There are, however, three principal crops
collected as follows: The first from
July to the middle of September; the
second in November; and the third
in January. Frequently there are
also collections in April and in May.
The tree is rather delicate, not as hardy
as the orange, for example. In upper
Italy it even becomes necessary to
cover the trees during the winter
months. Lemons intended for shipment
are picked before they are fully
ripe and packed in barrels or boxes
holding from 400 to 700. When exposed
the fruit shrinks and loses in
weight very rapidly, due to the evaporation
of moisture from the pulpy interior.
In Italy each lemon is wrapped
in tissue paper to protect it against injury
and to reduce the evaporation of
moisture. Sometimes they are coated
with collodion or covered with lead foil
to reduce the loss of moisture.</p>

<p>The lemon is put to various uses.
The yellow rind contains many minute
cavities which are filled with a fixed oil
and an ethereal oil to which the fruit
owes its fragrant odor. In Italy the
oil is obtained in a very crude way.
The peel is cut into three longitudinal
slices. The workman takes
one of these in his right hand,
in the left he grasps a small sponge;
by pressing the sponge against the
outer surface of the rind so that it becomes
concave, the oil-bearing sacs
are ruptured and the oil absorbed by
the sponge. This is repeated until the
sponge becomes saturated, when the
juice is squeezed into a cup or other
vessel. I am very much afraid that
the sponge and the hands of the workman
are not always clean. I have
been informed that an attempt to introduce
machinery for extracting the
oil was forcibly resisted. It is also
stated that the oil obtained by the
"sponge process" is more valuable than
that obtained by machinery and distillation.
The bitter taste so evident in
the lemon is due to <i>limonin</i> and
<i>hesperidin</i>, which occur most abundantly
in the rind.</p>

<p>The sour taste of the lemon is due to
citric acid, which is found in the large
cells forming the pulpy interior. Of
course the sap is largely water, about
97.5 per cent., with about 2 per cent.
citric acid. The amount of acid varies,
however, even rising to 9 or 10 per
cent. The juice is easily expressed
and is put to various uses. Lemonade
is largely consumed on ships, as it is
said to prevent ship scurvy. Washing
face and hands with diluted lemon
juice is said to remove tan and freckles.
The beneficial properties of lemon
juice, lemonade, in fevers is due to its
cooling and refreshing effects, and also
to the fact that it acts as a heart sedative,
thus tending to lower the temperature.
Lemon juice has been highly
recommended in acute rheumatism and
also to counteract the effects of certain
poisons, especially opium.</p>

<p>The essential oil of lemon acts as a
stimulant and has been used in diseases
of the eye (<i>ophthalmia</i>). It also
serves to give an agreeable odor to
certain medicines, and is used in the
manufacture of perfumery and as a
flavoring agent for confectionery.</p>

<p>The lemon peel is used in medicine.
Candied lemon peel is a confection
prepared by boiling the peel in syrup
and then allowing the sugar to crystallize.</p>

<p>The following is a description of the
excellently colored plate: <i>A</i> is a
flowering and fruit-bearing twig, nearly
natural size; 1 is a single flower, somewhat
magnified; 2, stamens and pistil;
3, ovary in longitudinal sections; 3<i>a</i>,
ovary in cross section; 4, anthers; 4<i>a</i>,
pollen-grains; 5, fruit, nearly natural
size; 6, cross-section of fruit showing
rind, large-celled pulp and seeds; 7, 8,
and 9, seeds.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="58" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS subject is an ancient and
honorable one. The most ancient
historical records make
frequent reference to the honey-bee.
A poem written 741 B. C., by
Eremetus was devoted to bees. In
Scripture we read of them and learn
that Palestine was "a land flowing with
milk and honey" and we know that wild
bees are very numerous there even to
the present time. In the year 50 B. C.,
Varro recommended that hives be made
out of basket-work, wool, bark, hollow-trees,
pottery, reeds, or transparent
stone to enable persons to observe the
bees at work. The name "Deborah" is
from the Hebrew and means bee; "Melissa,"
from the Greek, has the same
meaning.</p>

<p>Honey-bees were introduced into the
United States from Europe, in the seventeenth
century, and our wild honey-bees
are offspring of escaped swarms.
Like all enterprising Yankees they first
settled in the eastern states and rapidly
spread over the West, where they
were regarded with wonder by the Indians
and called the "white man's fly."
They traveled, or spread, with such regularity
that some observers claimed to
mark the exact number of miles which
they traveled westward during each
year.</p>

<p>A great many species are almost, or
entirely, worthless for domestic purposes,
while those that are especially
valuable are very few. The favorite at
this time seems to be the Italian species,
which was introduced into the
United States in 1860.</p>

<p>At the opening of the season each
colony of honey-bees contains one laying
queen, several drones, and from
3,000 to 40,000 workers. The workers
begin by cleaning up the hive, and the
queen starts in to rear other bees at once;
new comb is started, honey is brought
in from the earlier varieties of flowers
and the busy bee is launched into another
season of sweetness and good
works.</p>

<p>The United States Department of
Agriculture, in one of its "Farmer's Bulletins,"
under the heading, "How to
Avoid Stings," says, "First, by having
gentle bees." At the time I first read
this I thought they should have completed
the advice by adding "and extract
their stings;" but I find on investigation
that the subject of gentle
bees, is no light matter to the bee-keeper,
and that my idea that "a bee is
a bee and hence entitled to all the
room he requires" does not hold good;
that a bee-keeper when purchasing a
colony of bees of any species not well
known to him will ask if they are gentle
in the same tone he would use if he
were inquiring about a horse.</p>

<p>Bees seem to do well wherever there
are flowers enough to furnish them with
food, and are kept for pleasure and
profit in all parts of our country. A
small plot of ground is devoted to bees
by the farmer, a village lot is often
filled with hives, and even in our larger
cities, especially in New York, Chicago,
and Cincinnati, if not in the gardens or
on the lawns, they may be found well established
on the house-tops, as many
as thirty or forty colonies being found
on a single roof. They can usually find
enough food in and around a city to
keep themselves busy without making
long excursions; in fact, it sometimes
happens that they find more abundant
pasturage in a city than they would in
the open country, especially where
there are large parks and gardens or
where the linden (basswood) trees
have been set out in any considerable
quantities. Sweet clover also sometimes
overruns a neglected garden or
vacant lot and furnishes a rich field for
the city-bred honey-bee.</p>

<p>In Egypt bees are transported on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
hive-boats from place to place along the
Nile according to the succession of
flowers. The custom also prevails in
Persia, Asia Minor and Greece. In
Scotland the same method is used while
the heather is in bloom and in Poland
bees are transferred back and forth between
summer pastures and winter
quarters.</p>

<p>A few years ago a floating bee house
was constructed on the Mississippi river
large enough to carry two thousand
colonies. It was designed to be towed
up the river from Louisiana to Minnesota,
keeping pace with the blossoming
of the flowers and then drop back down
the river to the sunny South before cold
weather should set in in the fall.
Honey-bee ships have also been talked
of which could carry bees to the West
Indies to cruise for honey during the
winter.</p>

<p>The bee is not fastidious, but will
live in any kind of clean box or barrel
that may be provided for its use, hence
it sometimes lives in queer places. A
swarm escaping will generally make its
home in a hollow tree or in a fissure of
some large rock. The ancient English
hives were generally made of baskets
of unpeeled willow. Cork hives are in
use in some parts of Europe, and
earthenware hives are in use in
Greece and Turkey. Glass hives are
mentioned as far back as the year
1665. In 1792 movable-comb hives
were invented and in the century following
more than eight hundred patents
were granted on hives in the United
States.</p>

<p>Bee products form an important item
of income in the United States, more
than two billion pounds of honey and
wax being produced in a single season.
When we consider that this appalling
amount of sweetness is gathered a drop
here and a drop there it leads us to
figures too large to be comprehended.</p>

<p>In considering the value of bees we
must by no means think of honey as
their sole product, as beeswax is an
important article. After the honey has
been extracted from the comb the latter
is mixed with water and boiled
down and run into firm yellow cakes,
from which the color disappears if exposed
for a certain length of time to
the air. Thin slices are exposed until
thoroughly bleached, when it is again
melted and run into cakes, and is then
known as the white wax of commerce.
Before oil lamps came into use large
quantities of this white wax were used
in the manufacture of candles, which
made the best light then known, as
they burned better than tallow candles
and without the smoke or odor which
made the tallow article objectionable.
The advent of the oil-lamp, the gas
jet, and the electric light have practically
disposed of its usefulness in
that direction, except in devotional
exercises, although colored tapers made
of white wax are now used for decorative
purposes, especially during the
holiday season, when numbers of them
are used to light our Christmas trees.
White wax is also used extensively for
making ornamental objects such as
models of fruits and flowers. Whole
plants are sometimes reproduced and
models of various vegetable and animal
products are reproduced in colored
wax and used for educational or museum
purposes. The anatomist finds
it of great value in reproducing the
normal and diseased structures of the
human form. No doubt the original
wax works of Mrs. Jarley, made famous
by Dickens in "The Old Curiosity
Shop," were a collection of wax images
made from the product of the honey-bee.</p>

<p>Metheglin is a drink made from
honey, and is consumed largely in
some parts of the world. It is the nectar
which the ancient Scandinavian expected
to sip in paradise, using skulls
of his enemies as goblets.</p>

<p>The East Indies and the Philippine
Islands seem to be under special obligations
to astonish the world in everything,
and in order to keep pace with
their reputations have produced honey-bees
of three sizes, one of which is the
smallest honey-bee known, and another
the largest. The smaller variety
is so diminutive that one square inch of
comb contains one hundred cells on
each side; the entire comb, as it hangs
from the twig of a small tree or bush,
is only about the size of a man's hand.
The workers are a little longer, but
somewhat more slender than our common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
house-fly, and are blue-black in
color, with the exception of the anterior
third of the abdomen, which is
bright orange.</p>

<p>The giant East Indian honey-bee,
which is probably identical with the
giant of the Philippines, is the largest
known species of the genus. They are
about one-third larger than our common
bee and build huge combs of very
pure wax which are attached to overhanging
ledges of rock or to the limbs
of large trees. These combs are often
five or six feet in length, three or four
feet in width and from one and one-half
to six inches in thickness. The amount
of honey that they gather in the course
of a season is enormous and it has been
suggested that if introduced into this
country they might be of immense
value as they would doubtless visit
mainly the plants which our honey-bees
could not well gather from, such
as red-clover, and thus increase the
amount of clover seed as well as the
quantity of honey already produced.
Up to date, however, it is not proven
that they will live in hives or that they
can live at all in this climate; the latter
being regarded as extremely doubtful
by some of our best informed bee-men.</p>

<p>Not the least interesting thing in an
apiary is the honey extractor, consisting
of a large can inside of which a
light metal basket is made to revolve
by means of a simple gearing. The
frames containing the full comb are
placed in this basket, the caps being
shaved off. After several rapid revolutions
the comb is found to be empty
and is then returned to the hives to be
refilled by the bees.</p>

<p>The queen bee is about one-third
larger than the worker and is the mother
and monarch of the hive. Queens are
sometimes raised by bee-keepers for
sale, especially by those who have
an improved strain of a certain species,
or a new and desirable species of bee.
When the bee-keeper gets a mail order
for a queen he procures a mailing-cage,
which is a small box-like cage covered
with wire screen and cloth, in one end
of which he places a supply of food, the
other end being occupied by a ventilator.
The queen and from eight to
twelve workers, as royal attendants, are
then placed in the cage, the wire-screen
and cloth covers carefully wrapped
around them, the address written, a one
cent stamp affixed and her royal
highness is ready for her trip across a
continent, or, with additional postage,
around the world.</p>

<p>When, from any cause, the bee-pastures
become unproductive bees from
different hives often declare war on
their neighbors, the strong colonies
singling out as enemies those that are
weak or disorganized by the loss of a
queen. The war is always pursued
without quarter and thousands on each
side perish in the fray, the victors
always carrying off every drop of honey
in the hive of the vanquished, leaving
the unfortunate survivors of the defeated
hive to perish by starvation.</p>

<p>In many parts of England when a
member of the family dies someone
must tell the bees; this is done by taking
the house door-key and rapping
thrice on each hive, repeating at the
same time the name of the deceased and
his station in the family. If this ceremony
is omitted the bees will surely
die. In some places the hives are
draped with a strip of black cloth when
a death occurs in the family and with
white cloth in case of a wedding. If
these ceremonies are omitted the bees
are insulted and will leave. Singing a
psalm in front of a hive that is not doing
well will also set all things right, in
some parts of England. I will not
attempt to explain how the American
bee-keeper rears bees without these
ceremonies, but refer the reader to the
various hand-books on bee-keeping
which will doubtless explain it.</p>

<p>The bees occupy a position in the
economy of nature far higher than that
of mere honey-gatherers. The service
they render in pollenizing the flowers
is worth far more to the world than
endless stores of honey. There are a
number of flowers that are so adjusted
that their pollen cannot of itself reach
the stigma but is so disposed that it is
certain to be carried away by any bee
or moth that chances to visit it, while
the stigma is so placed that an incoming
bee is certain to reach it on first alighting
on the flower and dust it with the
pollen which has accumulated on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
hairs on the under portion of the bee,
or has clung to his legs; this, of course,
causes cross-fertilization, a peculiar and
wonderful provision of nature, which
seems to be necessary for the preservation
of fruits and flowers and for the
improvement of the different kinds.
Whole volumes have been written on
this subject, which even now is not entirely
understood, but a single case will
give a little insight into the matter.
The common primrose will produce
even from seeds selected from the same
pod, two different kinds of flowers, in
about equal proportions, which are sterile
of themselves. But each kind may,
by means of the good offices of the
bee or other honey-loving insect, fertilize
the other. If no bees or other insects
visit either of these flowers no
seed can be produced and the life of
the plant ends in a single season.
Cross-fertilization is necessary to some
plants and beneficial to all. Nature has
so devised it and has accordingly made
the flowers conspicuous to insects by
painting them, in most cases, a different
and brighter hue than the foliage of
the plant, making the blossom, in some
cases, give forth a pleasant odor, and
in nearly all cases causing the flower to
secrete the nectar which the insects
love. Flowers which do not attract the
insects by their bright colors, odor, or
nectar, are generally adapted to cross-fertilization
by the wind or are partly or
wholly fertile in themselves.</p>

<p>It is a pretty well established fact
that the flowers which we particularly
esteem, the bright-colored, perfumed,
nectar-producing varieties, owe their existence
to the bees. We also owe the
fruits which we love to the selection of
the bee to a large extent. Some of the
best varieties of strawberries are entirely
sterile and must be planted in
close proximity to fertilizing varieties
in order to bring forth any fruit at all.
Some varieties of pears also require fertilization
by the bees, and cannot bear
fruit if bees are excluded. Even the
apple is not perfect unless fertilized by
the bees, five distinct pollenizations
being required to perfect a single blossom,
and in places where orchards do
not bear it is often found that the introduction
of four or five hives of bees
for each one hundred trees will cause
them to bring forth fruit in abundance.</p>

<p>So, whether we wear bright flowers,
or eat fruit or honey, or stroll through
meadows sweet with clover, the handiwork
of the bee follows us and impresses
us with the fact that our little
friend lives only to give us sustenance,
sweetness, and pleasure.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN Venezuela there is a species of
crane, called by the natives the
Yak-a-Mik, which is easily tamed
and trained to look after a flock of
sheep or take care of the inmates of
the poultry yard. When these are
placed in charge of this bird it may be
implicitly trusted to take them to their
feeding places in the morning and
bring them safely home at night, not
forgetting to hunt for and collect any
stragglers. The Yak-a-Mik displays
all the traits of character usually associated
with the faithful sheep-dog.
It can be amusing, too, for, while its
usual gait is slow and sedate, it can execute
the most fantastic waltzes and
strike all sorts of absurd attitudes. A
German agriculturist, Herr von Seyffert,
had one of these cranes which took
charge of a herd of heifers, driving
them to and from their pastures. It
also kept order in the poultry yard,
stopping all fighting and disorder.</p>

animals, and even minerals
have played an important part
in the expression of religious
ideas and in the execution of religious
rites. Among the plants, sacred, and
closely allied to the mystic life of a
portion of the human race, there is
none more interesting and rich in legend
than the mistletoe. This was associated
with religious observances before
the time of Christ and was mentioned
by our earliest historians.</p>

<p>There are over seventy species of
this peculiar plant. Both the American
variety (<i>Phoradendron flavescens</i>) and
the European, or true mistletoe (<i>Viscum
album</i>), belong to a family of parasites,
so called because they derive
their nourishment entirely or in part
from some other plant instead of taking
it directly from the soil. Owing to the
presence of the green coloring matter
(<i>Chlorophyll</i>), in the stems and leaves,
the mistletoe is not entirely parasitic,
but is to a certain extent self-supporting,
drawing but a portion of its nourishment
from the tree on which it
grows.</p>

<p>It is found both on deciduous and on
evergreen trees. In some locations in
Europe it is especially abundant on the
apple tree and, if in the right climate,
there are few tree species which are
exempt from serving as its host.</p>

<p>The mistletoe is an evergreen shrubby
plant of slow growth, attaining a length
of about four feet and its duration of
life is practically that of the tree on
which it grows. The leathery leaves
and rugged stems are yellowish green
in color and, in the axils of the leaves,
are the small and insignificant flowers,
which ripen about Christmas-tide into
pearly white translucent berries. The
seeds are probably distributed through
the agency of fruit-eating birds which,
after eating, wipe their beaks on the
trunks and limbs of trees, leaving the
seeds snugly planted in the crevices of
the bark.</p>

<p>In Scandinavian mythology we find
the mistletoe used to cause the death
of one of the favorite gods of the
Norsemen, Baldur, the god typifying
the beautiful, the good, and the wise.
In this myth other friendly gods, fearing
Baldur's death, with his mother,
exacted an oath from animals, plants
and minerals that they would not injure
him. Unfortunately, however, the
mistletoe was forgotten and Loki, the
god of evil, knowing this fact and jealous
of Baldur's beauty, gathered a
branch, and taking it to Hödur, the blind
god of brute strength, directed him
how to aim it. Baldur was pierced by the
mistletoe and fell to the ground, dead.</p>

<p>But it was in "Merrie England" that
the mistletoe was held most sacred,
most revered. The Druids, the early
priests of the Gauls and Britons, were
accustomed to retreat to the oak
groves for their mystic rites. The
mistletoe was not often found upon the
oak, but when discovered, was the occasion
of special rejoicing and peculiar
ceremonies, being cut with a golden
hook, and white bulls were sacrificed
under the favored tree. We are told
by some authorities that as the oak
was the symbol of God, the All-powerful,
so the mistletoe became the symbol
of man, receiving his life and sustenance
from God. There are other
interesting myths; and, in fact, the
mistletoe is closely woven with many
beliefs and rites of the Druids.</p>

<p>At Christmas-tide the mistletoe is
largely used for decorative purposes,
especially in England, where the custom
is ancient, and also in our own
land, where each holiday season finds
more and more of this unique plant
gracing chandelier and window, until
we, too, may some day find our maids
all kissed&mdash;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE bald eagle became the bird
of our nation in the year 1873.
It is at home in all parts
of North America. Its nest in
the top of a lofty tree is a common
landmark in Maine, and on the great
mountain peaks of the western states
the nest is usually placed upon the
rock where no man nor beast is able to
climb.</p>

<p>The American eagle lives in America
only, but an eagle living in the Old
World looks very much like it. The
American bird is larger than the one
found in Europe. It is believed that
the bird of our country sometimes
visits Europe, for an eagle is seen
there at times that seems to be our own
bald eagle.</p>

<p>The birds that have beaks and claws
like those of the eagle are very
much like the cat family upon the
ground. They are all fierce hunters
and live upon weaker animals and
birds. The greatest of all the cat family
is the lion, the king of beasts. The
greatest of the cats of the air is the
eagle, and he is called the king of
birds.</p>

<p>As the cats have claws and teeth for
catching and tearing their prey so the
eagles have beaks and talons which
are strong and sharp. The cats come
quickly upon their prey without the
least noise. So do the eagles. They
come down from the sky like lightning
and nothing is swift enough to get
away, unless it is warned of the eagle's
coming.</p>

<p>An eagle sometimes lives to be over
one hundred years old. Many years
ago it was said that an eagle never
dies of sickness nor of old age, but that
its beak grows out of shape in its last
years so that it cannot eat.</p>

<p>All people have admired the eagle.
The Indians of America have always
liked to wear the feathers of the king
of birds, and in Scotland the chief was
known by the feather of an eagle
which he wore in his bonnet.</p>

<p>It often happens that a young eagle
looks much larger than its father or
mother. This is because the first feathers
of the wings and tail are longer than
the ones that grow in their place when
the young eagle has once shed them.
The young eagle is also darker than
the old one. This is why some people
have made mistakes in writing about
them without knowing a young eagle
from an old one.</p>

<p>Eagles of the same kind are not
always of the same color. Some are
darker than others and the markings
are not alike. Some young eagles
shed their downy feathers early and
wear the dress of grown-up birds.
Others keep some or all of their baby
feathers five or six years. And there
are some very old eagles still wearing
some of the downy feathers of their
first dresses.</p>

<p>Eagles kept in cages lose some of
their fierce ways and change the colors
of their dress. But they do not forget
that they are eagles. A large cat
once went under the bars of an eagle's
cage to get the meat which had not
been eaten by the bird. Down came
the eagle, tore the cat to pieces, and
ate him in a hurry.</p>

<p>The bald eagle is very fond of fish.
I have seen him on a bright day sailing
high above a lake where I was fishing.
He was so slow and lazy that I did not
think he was fishing too. But when he
saw a fine large fish near the top of
the water he came down like a flash,
struck his claws into the fish, and flew
away to his mate in a tree upon the land.</p>

<p>Sometimes the eagle gets the fish
hawk to do the work for him. Waiting
on the branch of some tree upon
the shore he sees the fish hawk flying
about over the water looking for his
prey. As soon as a fish has been caught
and the hawk is coming ashore to eat
it, the eagle frightens the hawk so as
to make him drop his fish. Then the
eagle catches it again before it strikes
the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>It is because he is such a robber that
some of the people of America did not
like to have him chosen to be the bird
of our nation. They felt that we ought
to have a bird that is good towards all
the other birds.</p>

<p>A poor family once lived for a long
time by robbing an eagle. The father
climbed to the nest and took away the
meat which the eagle brought for its
young. Every day he got food for his
family from the eagle. When the
young birds were almost ready to fly
he cut the feathers from their wings so
they could not leave the nest. Then
he tied them in to make sure of his
own meat every day. The young ones
cried harder when tied and the old
ones thought they were hungry and
brought them more flesh.</p>

<p>When the young are old enough to
fly the old eagles fly above them as if
to show them how easily it is done. If
the young do not try to fly when the
old ones think it time, they are pushed
out of the nest as if to kill them. But
the young wings flutter so that the bird
does not fall hard, and the old bird flies
under her young one to prevent any harm.</p>

<p>The eye of this bird is so keen that
it can see a small animal much farther
than the animal can see the great bird.
When out of sight in the sky the eagle
can see a hare as it comes out of its
hole. It comes down so fast that it
sometimes catches the hare before it
can get back to a safe place.</p>

<p>When the sky is clear the eagle flies
very high, but on cloudy days he keeps
nearer the ground. He likes to fly
over waterfalls because fish are to be
caught as they pass over the falls. At
Niagara Falls eagles are often seen
because animals are sometimes carried
over the falls by the rushing water, and
the birds can get them easily.</p>

<p>The eagle likes to face the sun and
fly towards it as if he thought he could
reach it. For a long time people wondered
how he could face the sun so
without being made blind. But we
know now that he has a covering for
his eyes that keeps them from all harm
from the strong light. If you watch a
chicken you may see it has two eyelids
for each eye. So has the eagle. The
eagle has a sort of eyebrow of feathers
that may help protect his eyes from
the strong light.</p>

<p>While the eagle is graceful in flying
he is not at all so in walking. Few
birds are so awkward on their feet.
His great claws are made for catching
his prey rather than for walking. He
can tear things with them and use them
in fighting, but he has not much use for
them upon the ground.</p>

<p>When they cannot get the food that
suits them best eagles will sometimes
steal farm animals. Lambs, or even full-grown
sheep are easily carried away.
They have been known to attack children
and carry them off. But they do
not often do this, and they have been
known to carry them a little way and
then set them down again as if the load
were too great or they did not wish to
eat them.</p>

<p>A story is told of a man who lived a
long time ago, and who had but one
child, a little girl. He wished to adopt
a poor little baby boy, but his wife did
not wish to take care of the boy. He
had the baby carried to the top of a
tree in which was the nest of an eagle.
The baby was placed in the nest so he
could not fall, and the man and his
wife walked under the tree. The child
cried so that the lady heard him. She
supposed it had been carried there by
the bird. Great haste was made to get
the baby down, and the lady was so
pleased to think she had saved the
child from being eaten by the birds
that she kept the little one as her own
son.</p>

<p>Eagles hunt in pairs. One flies
about near the ground to scare the
game from the bushes and trees, while
the other keeps watch from above to
swoop down on the first thing that
comes in sight. While their young
ones are in the nest the old birds are
very active. They are fierce if anyone
comes near the young.</p>

<p>Sometimes they show as much cunning
in taking their prey as any of the
cat family. In flying down to catch
animals upon the ground they take
care to fly so that their shadow will
not frighten their prey. An eagle
has been known to destroy an animal
too large to be picked up by flying at
the animal fiercely as it stood upon the
edge of a steep place. The wings of
the bird frightened the animal so as to
drive it over the cliff to meet death
upon the rocks below.</p>

<h2><a name="NUTS" id="NUTS"></a>NUTS.</h2>

<p>1. The English walnut (<i>Inglandaceæ</i>)
has a thin shell. This nut is
much esteemed and is an important
article of commerce. It yields by expression
a bland fixed oil, which, under
the names of "walnut oil" and "nut
oil," is much used by painters and is a
common article of food.</p>

<p>2. The peanut (<i>Arachis</i>) is also called
ground nut and earth nut. It is cultivated
in all warm regions of the
globe, and its usefulness is such that
it is likely to extend. It was introduced
from Peru into Spain, and
thence into France. It succeeds in
favorable situations and yields from
eighty to one hundred fold. Its cultivation
is so general in the eastern parts
of Africa, and even in the interior, that
doubts have been therefore entertained
of its American origin, of which,
the most eminent botanists seem to be
quite satisfied. The fruit is sometimes
eaten raw, but generally boiled or
roasted. The importance of the plant
is chiefly owing to the fixed oil contained
in it, which is used for the same
purposes as olive or almond oil.</p>

<p>3. The Brazil nut is the fruit of the
<i>Bertholletia excelsa</i>, a large tree of the
order <i>Lecythidaceæ</i>, found chiefly on
the Orinoco. The shell is very hard,
and contains a rich, oily meat in one
piece like an almond. The Portuguese
early carried on an extensive
trade in these nuts. They are now
chiefly imported from Para, and continue
to form an article of great commercial
importance. When fresh, they
are highly esteemed for their rich
flavor; but they become rancid in a
short time from the great quantity of
oil they contain. This has been largely
extracted for use in lamps.</p>

<p>4. The hickory nut (<i>Carya alba</i>)
abounds near the great lakes and in
some parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The nuts are in considerable demand
and are sometimes exported.
The shell is thin, but hard, and the
kernel sweet. The oil, which was used
by the Indians as an article of food,
was obtained from it by pounding and
boiling.</p>

<p>5. The filbert is the fruit of the <i>Corylus
avellana</i> or hazel. The kernel has a
mild, farinaceous, oily taste, agreeable
to the palate. In England filberts
are usually large hazel nuts. The
American hazel nuts are of two other
species.</p>

<p>6. The chestnut (<i>Castanea vesca</i>)
is eaten raw, boiled, or roasted, or
is ground into meal and puddings,
cakes, and bread are made from it. The
tree is common to Europe and America.</p>

<p>7. The pecan (<i>Carya olivalformis</i>),
sometimes called the Illinois nut, a
species of hickory nut. The shell is
thin and the meat well flavored. The
tree grows in North America, chiefly in
the Mississippi valley, and in Texas,
where it is one of the largest of forest
trees.</p>

<p>8. The almond (<i>Amygdalus</i>) grows
on a tree about twenty or thirty feet
high, a native of the East and of
Africa, but has now become completely
wild in the whole south of Europe. It
is planted for the sake of its beautiful
flowers, which resemble those of the
peach in form and color. The wood
of the tree is hard and of a reddish
color, and is used by cabinet-makers.
But it is chiefly valued on account of
the kernel of its fruit, well known by
the name of almonds, an important
article of commerce. It is mentioned
in the Old Testament, and appears to
have been cultivated from a very early
period. It was introduced into Britain
as a fruit-tree before the middle of the
sixteenth century, but it is only in the
most favored situations in the south of
England that it ever produces good
fruit. It is successfully cultivated in
southern California. Almonds are
either sweet or bitter. The bitter appear
to be the original kind, and the
sweet to be an accidental variety, perpetuated
and improved by cultivation.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BIRTH_OF_ATHENA" id="THE_BIRTH_OF_ATHENA"></a>THE BIRTH OF ATHENA.</h2>

<p class="ac">BY EMILY C. THOMPSON.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="24" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT IS a study, interesting to some of
our modern scholars, to fathom
the depths of obscurity and bring
up from the hidden past, from the
minds of men long departed, their conceptions
of the beings whom they worshiped.
Still more interesting is it to
surmise and conjecture the origin of
these marvelous beings. Charming
books have been written upon these
subjects and they prove fascinating to
the reader who, with vivid imagination,
can follow the theories of each author
and the long fantastic proofs. The gods
of the Greeks, those anthropomorphic
beings, throbbing with life, radiant with
beauty, the ideal of all that is fair and
lovely, and yet the prey of human passions
and desires, are a never-ending
source of delight to classical students.</p>

<p>All theories start from the supposition
that the gods had their origin
either in physical or mental phenomena.
Many try to trace out the effect which
the world of nature with its wonders,
its beauties, and its fearful realities, has
had upon the savage and primitive
mind, and how from these impressions
arose the main gods of the Greek religion.
Of course there are scholars
on the other side who will not admit
that there is any physical aspect of any
of the gods. So the conflict rages, exciting,
even absorbing, but inconclusive.
The method of proof must depend
largely upon the actual remains of that
civilization which are still left for us in
the literature and art of that people.
The Greeks had an established theogony
very early, as we know by the
"Theogony" of Hesiod, which still remains.
In this the parents of the gods
were traced far back, to Gaia, the earth,
and Uranus, the sky, who themselves
were sprung from Chaos. A minute
relationship was figured out between all
their deities which is to us almost too
perplexing to follow. Many names in
this theogony are names taken from
nature, as those above, and so the scholars
get a basis for their investigations.</p>

<p>Athena was one of the principal goddesses
of this race, the virgin goddess
of wisdom and of the arts of life, especially
honored at Athens, the seat of ancient
culture. Could any goddess seem
farther removed from anything physical
or material?&mdash;and yet we find many
theories from competent, earnest scholars,
brought forward to prove that such
a relationship did exist. The birth of
this goddess as recorded by the ancient
writers was peculiar. At a blow given
by Hephæstus (Vulcan) or Prometheus,
she sprang from the head of Zeus, the
great god of Olympus, clad in her armor,
full-grown, and perfect.</p>

<p>A few quotations will tell us the story
and show us all upon which the scholars
have to base their theories about
the origin of the goddess and her nature.</p>

<p>Homer presents Athena to us as the
daughter of Zeus, and of Zeus alone,
but he does not tell anything about her
birth. She seems to be the spoilt darling
of her father, or as one German
writer calls her, <i>sein anderes Ich</i>. She
wears the ægis of her father and sometimes
all his armor, as she takes an active
part in the battles, aiding her beloved
Achæans.</p>

<p>Hesiod, Theogony, 886-900; 924-926.</p>

<p>"Zeus, the king of the gods, made
Metis first his bride&mdash;Metis, most knowing
of gods and of mortal men. But
when she was about to bear the glancing-eyed
goddess Athena, then deceiving
her mind by craft, by winning
words, he swallowed her, by the
shrewdness of Gaia and starry Uranus,
for thus they advised him, that no other
of the ever-living gods might gain
kingly honor in place of Zeus. For
from her it was decreed that there
should spring clever children; first
the glancing-eyed maiden, Tritogenia
(Athena), having equal strength with
her father and wise counsel; but that
then she would bear a son, king of gods
and men, with overbearing heart. But
first Zeus swallowed her, since the goddess
purposed both good and evil for
him.... So he himself bore from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
his head the glancing-eyed Athena,
terrible, strife-stirring, leader of the
host, the unwearied, revered one, whom
the din of battle, wars, and combat delights."</p>

<p>Pindar, Olympian VII, 33-38.</p>

<p>"Then the golden-haired one (Apollo)
spoke from the fragrant shrine of the
temple, spoke of the voyage from the
Lernæan shores straight to the sea-girt
island where the king of the gods, the
great one, moistened the city with
golden snowflakes, when by the arts of
Hephæstus, by his brazen ax, Athena
springing down the crest of her father's
head, uttered the war cry with a mighty
shout, and Heaven and Mother Earth
shuddered before her."</p>

<p>Homeric Hymn to Athena XXVIII.</p>

<p>"Of Pallas Athena, honored goddess,
I begin to sing, with glancing eyes, of
many counsels and kindly heart, revered
maiden, savior of cities, valiant,
Tritogenia, whom Zeus himself bore
from his sacred head, clad in her arms
of war, golden, all-radiant. Wonder
held all the immortals as they looked
upon her. She quickly sprang before
ægis-bearing Zeus from his immortal
head shaking her sharp spear. And
great Olympus trembled terribly beneath
the weight of the glancing-eyed
one, and the earth about resounded
fearfully, and the sea was moved, agitated
with its purple waves, and the
salt water was poured forth on a sudden.
The glorious son of Hyperion (the
sun) stopped his swift-footed steeds
for a long time until the maiden Pallas
Athena took her arms from her immortal
shoulders and all-wise Zeus rejoiced.</p>

<p>"So hail to thee, daughter of ægis-bearing
Zeus! But of thee and of another
song I shall be mindful."</p>

<p>Lucian, Dialogi Deorum VIII.</p>

<p>In Lucian's "Dialogues of the Gods"
we find the following scene which gives
an amusing account of the story in the
words of Hephæstus and Zeus.</p>

<p><i>Hephæstus.</i>&mdash;"What must I do, O
Zeus? For I have come with my ax,
the sharpest one, if it should be necessary
to cleave stones at one blow."</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i>&mdash;"That is good, O Hephæstus,
but bring it down and cleave my head
in twain."</p>

<p><i>Heph.</i>&mdash;"Are you trying me or are
you insane? Tell me truly what you
wish of me."</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i>&mdash;"This very thing, to cleave my
head. If you disobey, not now for the
first time will you make trial of my
anger. You must strike with your
whole heart and not delay for I am tortured
by the pains which confuse my
brain."</p>

<p><i>Heph.</i>&mdash;"See to it, O Zeus, lest we
do some harm, for the ax is sharp and
not without bloodshed."</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i>&mdash;"Only strike quickly, Hephæstus,
for I know the consequences."</p>

<p><i>Heph.</i>&mdash;"I am unwilling, but still I
shall strike, for what must I do when
you bid? What is this? A maiden
clad in armor! A great evil, O Zeus,
did you have in your head! Naturally
were you quick to anger, keeping such
a maiden beneath the covering of your
brain and armed too. I suppose it has
escaped our notice that you had a camp
and not a head. She leaps and dances,
shakes her shield, brandishes her spear,
and is in an ecstasy. And the greatest
marvel, she is fair and vigorous&mdash;already
in this short time. Quick-glancing
eyes has she, and a helmet, too, adorns
her. Therefore, oh Zeus, as my wages,
promise her to me."</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i>&mdash;"You ask what is impossible,
Hephæstus, for a maiden always it is
her wish to remain. I, as far as I am
concerned, do not gainsay it."</p>

<p><i>Heph.</i>&mdash;"I wanted this. I'll manage
it and I'll snatch her away."</p>

<p><i>Zeus.</i>&mdash;"If it is easy for you, do it.
Still I know that you ask what is impossible."</p>

<p>A certain Philostratus gives descriptions
of paintings which he pretended
belonged to a gallery in Naples, and
this is one of them: "The Birth of
Athena."</p>

<p>"Those astonished ones are the gods
and goddesses to whom the order has
been given that even the nymphs are
not to be absent from heaven, but are
to be present with the rivers from which
they are sprung. They shudder at
Athena, but just now sprung in her arms
from the head of Zeus, by the arts of
Hephæstus, as the ax shows. No one
could imagine the material of her panoply,
for as many as are the colors of
the rainbow as it changes into different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
lights, so many colors flash from her
arms. And Hephæstus seems in doubt
by what gift he should win the favor of
the goddess for his bait is spent since
her arms have grown with her.</p>

<p>Zeus gasps with pleasure, as those
enduring great pain for great gain, and
inquires for his child, proud that he
bore her, and Hera is not angry, but
rejoices as if she had borne the maiden
herself. Now two peoples sacrifice to
Athena on two citadels, the Athenians
and the Rhodians, land and sea; of the
one indeed the sacrifices are without
fire and incomplete. Among the
Athenians fire is painted and the savor
of sacrifices and smoke, as if fragrant
and ascending with the savor; therefore,
as to the wiser and those sacrificing
well, the goddess comes to them.
It is said that gold was poured down
from heaven for the Rhodians and
filled their houses and streets since
Zeus poured out a cloud upon them
because they, too, revered Athena; and
the god Wealth stood upon their acropolis,
winged, as if from the clouds
and golden from the material in which
he appears, and he is painted as having
eyes, for from foresight he came to
them."</p>

<p>Now that practically all the evidence
has been brought it is time to investigate
the theories propounded by these
modern scholars and the various interpretations
which they put upon this
strange birth of a deity.</p>

<p>Preller looks upon Athena as the
goddess of the clear sky. In the
cloudy sky, in the midst of the storm
and lightning the clear bright heaven
appeared, and this was the birth of
Athena. The sky is of the greatest
beauty in Greece, especially in Attica,
so Athena was most honored in this
land.</p>

<p>To another German scholar, Welcker,
she is the æther and also the spirit,
presenting both sides of the nature of
her father, being æther, the daughter
of Zeus dwelling in the æther and
spirit, the daughter of Zeus the most
high spirit. He lays a great deal of
stress upon etymologies in his method
of proof, deriving the name Athena
from æther, but as every author has a
different derivation for this name
equally plausible, it is impossible to
have full confidence in this gentleman's
theory.</p>

<p>Ploix regards Athena as the twilight,
and Max Müller brings forward
his inevitable "Dawn" as the
true solution of the question, but the
view which is presented in Roscher's
Lexicon is perhaps the most sensible
of all on this side. Originally Athena
was the storm-cloud, and her birth from
the head of Zeus shows this, Roscher
maintains. This interpretation is evident
all through the myth. The
clouds appear in different forms, sometimes
as the head of Zeus the god of
the weather, at other times as the
ægis. The lightning is the bright
hatchet or glittering lance with which
the blow is dealt. The thunder is the
terrible war cry. That she was born
in the west adds to this evidence, as
storms came to the Greeks from that
direction.</p>

<p>Farnell contends valiantly in support
of his theory that Athena represents
no physical force in nature, but
wisdom. In antiquity he acknowledges
that some philosophers did regard
Athena in the other light. Aristotle
looked upon her as the moon. The
stoic Diogenes Babylonius gave a
physical explanation of her birth. He
recalls also a comment of a scholiast
to Pindar, which tells that Aristocles
said that the goddess was concealed
in a cloud, and that Zeus, striking the
cloud, made the goddess appear. He
remarks that philosophers then, in their
vagaries, were no better than modern
scholars, but that the conceptions
which the Greek people and poets had
are important for us in reaching a true
conclusion; so he endeavors to prove
that neither in the accounts of the
poets nor in the minds of the Greeks
was there any physical conception of
the goddess.</p>

<p>In the hymn quoted above he reminds
us that there is no thunder
which could not be left out if this were
the description of a storm. He says
also that there is nothing physical in
the picture which Pindar gives us, unless
the terrible cry of a deity must be
taken to mean thunder. Lucian tells
of no storm, and Philostratus, who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
so fond of finding remote allusions
does not seem to find any indication
of a clash of the elements. The only
physical feature in his description is
the comparison of the panoply of
Athena to a rainbow. So Farnell says:
"It may be admitted, then, that these
poetical descriptions do not consciously
express the physical fact. To
make them serve the other theories we
must regard their highly wrought
phrases as mere survivals of an ancient
poetical symbolic diction which did
more clearly express this." If this
were true, would not the earlier accounts
preserve this diction for us?
But they do not, for this symbolic language
is not found in either Homer or
Hesiod. He says: "Is it not more
natural to say that as imagination
dwelt upon her birth the poets tended
to embellish it with the richest phraseology,
to represent it as a great cosmic
incident in which the powers of heaven
and earth were concerned?"</p>

<p>His opponents seem to base all their
interpretations upon the later accounts,
beginning with the Homeric hymn, for
this story which Hesiod gives is in the
way as there is no phenomenon in the
world of nature corresponding to the
swallowing of Metis. Metis is Thought
or Counsel and is a personification of
this abstract idea as Hesiod shows by
calling her the most knowing of gods
and men. Preller objects to this, and
affirms that this primitive language
does not deal with abstractions, and
that the adjective thus applied to her
by Hesiod simply connects her with
the water, as there is a sea nymph of
that name. But in all the myths which
mention Metis, she appears as Thought
or Counsel, and it is absurd in a language
which personifies grace, righteous
indignation, and law not to allow
Metis (Thought) to be a similar personification.</p>

<p>Of course the worship of Athena had
been long in vogue before a story of
her birth arose. So Farnell reasons
out the origin of the story thus: In
her worship Athena appeared to have
abundant thought and counsel, therefore
she naturally became the daughter
of Thought or Counsel, the daughter of
Metis; she had all the powers of Zeus,
therefore she became the daughter of
Zeus, and as she had no feminine weakness
and inclined to father more than
mother, she could not have been born
in the ordinary way, and this might
have been so if Zeus had followed a
fashion common in myth and had
swallowed her mother, Metis. The
prophecy given in Hesiod as the reason
for the swallowing probably arose
after the story, as the fulfillment of the
prophecy could have been hindered in
easier ways, and it is likely that this
reason was borrowed from other
myths, as, for example, the Cronos
story.</p>

<p>The above explanation, Farnell says,
is, of course, only a hypothesis, but it
has the advantage over the others of
being suggested by the most ancient
form of the legend and the most ancient
ideas concerning the goddess.
He adds that the appearance of Prometheus
and Hephæstus in later accounts
would only strengthen his interpretation,
the association of these
divine artists with the goddess of
wisdom and of the arts of life.</p>

<p>This was a favorite subject with the
artists from the earliest times as old
vase paintings bear witness. But the
famous representation was that in the
east pediment of the Parthenon, the
work of Phidias. Only fragments of
this remain to-day. The central group
is entirely lost except for the torso
of one god, supposed by some to
be Hephæstus, but more probably it
is that of Prometheus. So the fragments
are of the side groups and not
so helpful in recalling the original, but
still conjectures and reproductions have
been innumerable.</p>

<p>In Madrid a Roman puteal has been
found which is believed to present the
central group of the east pediment.
Upon this Zeus is seated, before him
Athena flees away, Victory flies after her
to place a crown upon her head and behind
Zeus Prometheus with the ax in his
hand draws back in fright and turns
away. This group of Phidias was, of
course, the culmination of this story in
art. The later representations are few
and supposed to be merely copies of
this.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHAT farm boy has not heard
this birdless voice echoing from
the ghostly shades of the
thicket close at hand, or scarcely audible
in the distance? Perhaps you have
heard it as you have passed between
the wood and the hill over there, coming
clear from the wood but reëchoing
from the hill only the shrill last syllable.
Farther away on the distant hill-top
you may have taken this last syllable
for the piping of the salamander.
The "whippoorwill" song belongs with
the early May moonlit balmy nights,
before the blossoms have lost their best
perfume and before farm work has become
a mere drudgery.</p>

<p>It vividly recalls the merry May-basketing
frolics, apparently so necessary
to existence on the farm; the fresh
green fields and woodland blossoms;
the planting season with all its hidden
promises. There is, in the warble of
the bluebird, glad promise of returning
spring; and in the animated whistle of
the ph&oelig;be reiteration of the earlier
promise; but the whippoorwill tells of
that delightful season realized. His is
not a complaint groaned forth, but a
glad announcement of joy fully come.</p>

<p>My early home nestled in one of
those gems of woodland that dot the
rolling Iowa prairies. One of my earliest
memories of this old home is the
twilight choruses of the whippoorwills
in the door-yard. They often ventured
upon the door-step and sang for minutes
at a time, apparently oblivious of the
members of the family seated just inside
the open door. On more than one occasion
more than one bird occupied the
door-step at the same time, all the while
apparently trying to drown each others'
voices in a continuous flow of song.
At such times the delightful mellowness
which one hears, with the birds in
the distance, gives place to an almost
painful, penetrating shrillness. The
more deliberately uttered song is invariably
preceded by a strongly guttural
sound not unlike that produced by
striking an inflated rubber bag. The
near-by song, to my ear, sounds like
"<i>qui ko wee</i>," the first syllable with a
strong "q" sound. I have never heard
them sing later than 11 o'clock in the
evening nor earlier than 3 in the morning.</p>

<p>It is well-nigh impossible to creep
upon a singing bird in the woods, even
if it could be seen in the dim light, but
it was not unusual, at my old home, for
the birds to playfully fly round and
round anyone who might be standing
out in the yard at twilight. The birds
often came so close that the wings
seemed to brush the face. The flight is
so utterly noiseless that the object of
their sport is aware of the presence before
he can fully realize what it is.</p>

<p>The whippoorwill inhabits the eastern
portion of the United States, west
to eastern North and South Dakota
and Nebraska, western Kansas, Indian
Territory and Texas; north to southern
Canada, into Nova Scotia and Manitoba;
and south in winter into eastern
Mexico and Guatemala. It breeds in
the northern and central parts of its
range, and rarely to Florida.</p>

<p>The nest is made late in May or early
in June, in the Northern states. The
eggs are two in number, light gray or
white, with brown and lilac markings
often arranged in scratchings and pencilings
besides the spots and blotches.
There is usually scarcely more of a nest
than the leaves lying on the ground;
rarely nothing but the bare ground.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EAGLE_2" id="THE_EAGLE_2"></a>THE EAGLE.</h2>

<p class="ac">(<i>Continued from <a href="#Page_25">page 25</a>.</i>)</p>

<p>Eagles are sometimes caught by
placing a large cage on edge so it will
fall when a string is pulled. A live
hen and her chickens are tied to the
cage so they may run under when the
eagle comes at them. As they run
into the cage to escape the eagle, he
follows them, the string is pulled, and
the eagle finds himself alone in the
trap, for the hen and her chickens
easily get out between the bars which
are too close together to allow him to
do the same.</p>

<p>An eagle once attacked a weasel.
This little animal is very fierce, and
will not give up its life easily. Finding
itself in the grasp of the bird, the
weasel turned and fastened its teeth
in the throat of the eagle. It was
lucky for the eagle that the weasel
did not cut his throat, but the little animal
never let go. Its teeth were
locked into the flesh of the eagle so
they could not be torn open. Years
afterwards the eagle was shot, and it
had on its neck a queer locket, the
skull of the weasel hanging there by
the teeth. Sometimes the weasel cuts
a vital part in the bird that picks it up,
and then the weasel enjoys the life-blood
of his enemy.</p>

<p>We have a gold coin that is named
after the eagle. It is worth ten dollars.
In fact it is ten dollars in gold.
The first one was made in 1792. Half-eagles,
quarter-eagles, and double-eagles
have also been made of gold at
our nation's mints.</p>

<p>In some countries besides America
it has been the national bird. When
the army of Rome first tried to land in
England the men feared the fierce
English soldiers. One soldier had an
Eagle with him in the boat. He
jumped into the sea with his eagle
and called to his friends to follow him.
They soon put the enemy to flight,
and the eagle was praised for helping
them win.</p>

<p>The eagle is fond of capturing such
birds as the swan. When he finds a
swan flying so high that it cannot get
to the water and dive out of his reach
the eagle flies against the swan from
below with such force that the breath
is knocked out of the swan in an instant.
As the swan falls lifeless to
the ground the eagle invites his mate
to meet him at the spot and they have
a great feast.</p>

<p>The eagle flies swifter than a railway
train, but one was once caught by
a train before it could rise and get
out of the way. The "cannon-ball"
train on the Georgia Railway was late.
In making up time it swung round a
curve in a cut at full speed. A bald
eagle was seen on the track by the
fireman, who was looking out of the
window. The pilot of the engine was
upon the bird before he could rise. It
struck him, tumbled him upon the
frame, and fastened one of his claws
into a wooden beam.</p>

<p>Before the eagle had time to get
back his senses the fireman climbed
along the foot-rail to the pilot. He
caught the great bird, and a fierce
struggle followed. The bird fought
for freedom and the fireman fought for
a prize.</p>

<p>The train was going at the rate of
forty-five miles an hour. It was hard
for the man to keep himself on the
engine with one hand on the rail and
the other holding the eagle, which tore
at him wildly as the engine swung to
and fro upon the rails.</p>

<p>The man's clothing was torn to
shreds and his hands were bleeding.
But he worked his way back to the
cab where the engineer assisted him in
tying the eagle so he could not get
away. But the tying was not easy for
two men, for the bird made good use
of his great beak and claws.</p>

<p>When spread out on the car floor he
measured seven feet from tip to tip of
his wings. He was not injured, and is
now kept as a splendid prisoner, the
king of American birds.</p>

<h2><a name="MIGRATORY_BIRDS" id="MIGRATORY_BIRDS"></a>MIGRATORY BIRDS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="24" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN the New World the birds of the
temperate zone are rather perplexing
in their migratory habits. Many
of those which go north to Canada
and Alaska in the summer pass the
winter in Mexico, Panama, and even
South Columbia; while others, as well
as a number of migrants from the
United States, go over to the West
Indies. One of the most wonderful instances
of migration is that of the tiny
flame-breasted humming-bird (<i>Selasphorus
rufus</i>), which breeds on the west
coast of America as far north as Alaska
and Bering Island, and winters in Lower
California and Mexico. Thus, with unerring
instinct, this diminutive bird,
scarcely two inches long, flies twice a
year the astounding distance of over
3,000 miles. The birds which belong
to the second class&mdash;those which breed
in the Arctic regions&mdash;comprise the
swans, many of the waders, and a considerable
number of ducks and geese.
In Europe these birds spend the winter
in all the countries from England
south to the Mediterranean and Black
seas, some even going as far south as
the upper reaches of the Nile. In
Asia most of the waders, such as snipe,
woodcock, sandpipers, and plovers, as
well as the ducks and the geese, spend
the winter in India and South China.
In America the Arctic birds migrate to
the Southern United States and Mexico.</p>

<p>The partial migrants, which form the
third class, are rather more puzzling in
their movements, for among them we
find birds whose motives for wandering
are very diverse. Some are unwilling
slaves&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, they get mixed up in the
big flights of true migratory birds, and
are irresistibly hurried along with
them; such are the rooks, starlings,
robins, etc., which are so frequently
seen in Heligoland in the midst of a
flock of swallows, warblers, and other
genuine migrants. Another lot of these
partial migrants are those which, perhaps,
most justly deserve this name;
viz., such birds as larks, pipits, titmice,
etc., which, although resident with us
all the year round, at times greatly
diminish in numbers, owing to more
than half the individuals changing their
abode. For instance, those which
breed in Scotland and England wander
in the winter over to France, but, unlike
the true migrant, always leave
some of their number behind.&mdash;<i>Walter
Rothschild, The Nineteenth Century.</i></p>

<h2><a name="THE_SNAPPING-TURTLE" id="THE_SNAPPING-TURTLE"></a>THE SNAPPING-TURTLE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_b.jpg" width="56" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">BY reason of the ferocity of disposition
of this curious animal,
the snapping-turtle (<i>Chelydra
serpentina</i>) is rather formidable,
not only to the smaller
creatures which inhabit the same localities,
but also to man, its bite
causing very severe wounds. It is
found in America from Canada to
Ecuador, and there are few localities
where it is not met with frequently.
Swimmers in small lakes are sometimes
attacked by it, the habits of the
animal both in the water and on land
being the same. It is bold as well as
fierce, often suffering itself to be lifted
from the ground by the object which it
has grasped rather than to let go its
hold. If attacked, the reptile's long
reach and strong jaws enable it to defeat
any ordinary foe. The elongated
tail of the snapping-turtle has given
rise to the popular name, alligator
turtle and, being appended to the
small, comparatively thin shell, giving
an elongated appearance to the body,
the specific name <i>serpentina</i> resulted.</p>

<p>When the snapper elevates itself for
the attack, with half-open mouth and
sullen eyes, there is said to be something
fiery and defiant in its attitude,
though it is so slow and awkward in
recovering itself after missing its point
of attack that it presents a most ludicrous
appearance. These turtles are
remarkably strong. The elder Agassiz
states that he observed one bite
off a piece of plank more than an inch
thick. They also attain considerable
size, being the largest inland representative
of the order, specimens not infrequently
exceeding three feet in
length. It is carnivorous in its habits,
and is very destructive of fish, small
quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles. Many
have been the water-fowl which have
ventured too close to their voracious
enemy. Its appetite is said to be so
great that it will even catch young
alligators, and devour them in spite of
their teeth and struggles.</p>

<p>The flesh of the snapping-turtle is
delicate, tender, and of rich flavor.
Every fisherman knows that it will take
almost any kind of bait, provided it be
of animal substance. It, however,
prefers fish, and cannot resist a hook
so baited.</p>

<p>In the northern United States, from
the tenth to the twentieth of June, it has
been observed, the female, at early
morning, leaves the water and crawls
to a sandbank, digs a small cavity with
its hind leg, into which the small, round
eggs are deposited to the number of
twenty-five or thirty, when the sand is
drawn over them, the surface smoothed
down, and the animal is soon back in
the water, the entire operation not lasting
over twenty minutes. This method
is different from that of our other land
turtles. Nothing but sand will suit
the purpose of the snapping-turtle.
In order to find a suitable spot for the
burial of her eggs, the female is often
forced to traverse a considerable distance.
The sand must be quite dry
and exposed to the full rays of the sun.
The little ones are hatched in July.
The young run by instinct into the
water.</p>

<p>Remarkable stories are told of the
longevity of the turtle and of its tenacity
of life. That they live to near a
century is well authenticated. After
the head is severed from the body the
head will open and shut the mouth and
roll the eyes. In one case a stick was
held between the open jaws, which
closed upon it with violence, and kept
hold of it. Meanwhile the headless
body was crawling on the ground.</p>

<p>An allied form (<i>Macrochelys lacertina</i>)
inhabits the tributaries of the

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN THE March number of the <i>Cosmopolitan</i>
of 1894, I read a most interesting
article about a tame humming-bird.
I know a number of
people who enjoyed it as much as I, so
I feel sure all lovers of pets, especially
of birds, will be interested in my story of
"Little Billee." I have always been passionately
fond of animals and would like
to make pets of them all. I have cared
the least for birds, (except out of doors)
and have known very little about them.</p>

<p>I have been ill many months, and
my family and friends have done all
they could to make the days pass as
quickly as possible for me. Early in
June my mother found a little brown
bird which could not have been more
than two weeks old. Thinking it
might amuse me she brought him up
stairs done up in her handkerchief, and
I took him inside the bed. After an
hour he seemed very happy and not at
all afraid. I looked him over carefully,
but found him uninjured. I took
him to the open window expecting to
see him try to fly away, but he did not
seem to have the slightest intention of
doing so. From that day to this he
has been perfectly devoted to me and
my constant companion. At this minute
he is sitting on the back of my neck
dressing his feathers.</p>

<p>The first day I could not get him to
eat anything until night, when he drank
milk from an after-dinner coffee spoon.
After that he took little pieces of
bread soaked in milk from my tongue
or lip. I fed him in that way for several
days, then he would take it out of
my fingers. He lived on bread and
milk for two weeks. Now he eats almost
everything that I do. All kinds of vegetables,
mushrooms, and ice cream. He
likes to sit on my hand or shoulder and
take them from my fork.</p>

<p>I have some kind of nourishment
every two hours and Little Billee knows
very well when my maid comes into
my room with a salver that there is
something on it to eat or drink, and he
is wild until he gets on my hand or
shoulder. He drinks milk from my
tumblers and will not drink water out
of anything but my medicine glass.
When Little Billee sees me sit down in
the morning with an orange on a plate,
he flies upon his cage, then over into
my lap, and sits on the first finger of
my left hand and eats the orange from
my spoon. At first he could not crack
his own seeds and as he was very fond
of them I used to do it for him. Now
he can crack them himself, but he prefers
eating them outside his cage, and
his hemp seed he always brings over
and eats on the rug in front of my bed.</p>

<p>Little Billee is very fond of little orange
blossom biscuits. I keep some in
a tin box under a table by the side of
my bed. For several days every time
I would reach out of bed and tap on
the box Little Billee would come running
for a piece. One day I was visiting
with a friend and we forgot all
about the bird. Soon we heard rap,
tap, tap, pop, pop, pop, and there was
Little Billee standing by the box waiting
for a piece. Since then he comes
many times a day. If I send him away
with a small piece he returns directly
for a large one.</p>

<p>I had quite a time teaching him to
stay in his cage. The first day I put
him in I was afraid he would die of
fright. I left the cage on the floor for
two days before he ventured in. After
he had been going in and out for some
time, I closed the door, but he was
frightened quite as much as at first, and
he would not go near the cage the rest
of the day. Finally I tried taking the
cage on my lap and shutting him in; he
did not seem afraid then and now he
does not mind being shut up in the
morning when I am in my dressing-room,
but he much prefers going in and
out at his own sweet will. If I leave
him shut up in his cage and go back to
bed, he is frantic until he is let out and
gets in the bed with me. For the first
two weeks he was not happy if he was
not on me somewhere. He would stay
in bed with me for hours at a time, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
now he plays on the floor, with a little
piece of paper, cotton, or ribbon, and
eats his seeds and biscuit.</p>

<p>I dress my hair high and it is Little
Billee's special delight to sit on the top
of my twist while I walk about my
room. During the first few weeks if I
put him on the floor when he had been
in bed with me, he would hop back and
forth on the rug in front of my bed, and
beg to be taken, or he would fly straight
up. I would put down my hand, he
would hop upon my finger and in a second
be back inside the bed. If I was
sitting in a chair and put him down on
the floor, he would climb right up from
my feet to my neck, put his little bill
in my mouth and chirp with glee. One
day he was on the floor and did not see
me go back to bed, but saw my wrapper
over a chair (which stood about a yard
from my bed). He supposed I was inside
of it, but when he reached the top
and found no mouth to put his bill into,
he gave several very mournful peeps,
but as soon as I spoke to him he chirped
and it did not take him long to fly over
to me. The next day when I put him
down on the floor I was anxious to see
what he would do. After teasing for
some time for me to take him, he went
to a chair, climbed up on the wrapper
until he reached the top, then flew over
to me. Ever after he came that way
when I refused to take him.</p>

<p>One day I left Little Billee on the
rug in front of the bed and went into
my dressing room. While I was gone
my mother came in and sat down.
He was much frightened. Every time
she spoke to him he ran under the bed,
stuck his little head out from under
the valance and peeped for me to
come to him. When I spoke he answered,
but was too much afraid to pass
mother to come to me. When I came out
he ran quickly to me and flew onto the
back of a very low chair. I bent down
and he flew up on my shoulder, chirping
as loud as he could. No little child
could have shown more joy in getting
back to its mother. I do not suppose
he remembers any other mother, and
thinks all little birds have just such
good mothers as I.</p>

<p>I have a magnificent big tiger cat
named Taffy, so I thought Little Billee
would be a very good name for my wee
bird. It seems a very appropriate name
too, as he spends a great deal of his
time dressing himself and manicuring
his nails. When he struts about with
his head held high you can plainly see
the long coat, high collar, high hat,
and umbrella and can easily imagine
the original Little Billee is before you.
But I fear Taffy and my Little Billee
will never go walking arm and arm together.
Taffy has already caught Little
Billee twice, but I have rescued him
from the jaws of death before any harm
was done. I am trying my best to get
them to live contentedly together. I
do not allow Little Billee to go out
into the hall for fear he will fly down
stairs and be caught by Taffy before
anyone can reach him. Before the
door into the hall is a small rug and he
thinks flying over that a great feat, but
when I say, "Little Billee, come right
home," he returns instantly.</p>

<p>He goes to bed at eight o'clock in a
little basket which I put on the top of
some hanging shelves so there will be
no danger from Taffy in the dark.
Taffy sleeps on my bed every night,
and very often on the outside when
Little Billee is inside, and it seems like
the lion and the lamb lying down together.
Little Billee will usually be
contented in his basket until 7 o'clock
in the morning, then I take him into
the bed with me where he lies quietly
on my arm, neck, or palm until I get
up at 9 o'clock. He never makes a
peep unless I speak to him, then he
chirps away like a happy child. On
fine evenings I sat before an open window
from 7 o'clock until 8 with Little
Billee on my finger listening to the
birds. When he became sleepy he
tucked his little head under his wing,
in a few minutes crawled into the
palm of my hand and went sound
asleep, ready for his basket.</p>

<p>When the hot wave came I went
down-stairs at 7 o'clock, shutting him
up in his cage.</p>

<p>The second night I had hard work
to catch him. He ran into the hall
and would not come when I called to
him. The third night, when he saw
me making preparations to dress, he
acted like mad. He hopped all around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
me, put out his tiny wings, and tried
to fly onto me, opened his bill, but not
a sound came out. As I stood in front
of my dressing table he flew to the top
of his cage (which stood on the floor)
to the back of a chair (which was near
me), then up to my shoulder, chirping
away so merrily that I knew he was
saying: "Please take me with you."
Of course, after that it is needless to
say I took him down-stairs, and he has
gone down every night since, where he
remains until 8 o'clock, then is put
into his basket, and I hear no more
from him until morning.</p>

<p>On pleasant mornings I sit on the
piazza and Little Billee sits on my hand
or plays in my lap. When I walk on
the sidewalk Little Billee goes, too,
and never offers to fly away, and if the
wind blows he holds on tight. Sometimes
he sings and always seems interested
in all that is going on about him.</p>

<p>Twice Little Billee has flown out of
my window from fright. Once he was
on my shoulder when a very small girl
with a very large hat came up to him
and away he flew. The next time a
large bunch of ferns was brought to
me. I thought he would like it and
think it was a nice little tree, but I am
all the tree he seems to care for. He
was so frightened he flew onto a chair,
and as I held up a fern out of the window
he went. Both times when my
maid went to look for him she could
not find him until she peeped, then he
answered, and she found him sitting in
the grass waiting to be picked up, and
he was delighted to get back to me.</p>

<p>Little Billee has never gone to any
one except my physician, and that
was when I had had him about a week.
He went to him, hopped all over his
shoulder, picked at his collar and tie
and was very friendly. Now he will
not go to even him, and I feel sure I
am Trilby and his only love. Perhaps
the children who read this will think
Little Billee is a little angel bird and
too good to live, but I will say right
here he is too bad to die. Like all
bright children sometimes he is very
naughty. For instance, when I want
to lie quietly on my bed in the day
time and Little Billee does not, he will
play for some time running up on the
top of my pillow, then down again,
hop on my arm, then under the sheet
until he finds my hand; back he goes
and does the same thing over again.
When he gets tired of that he will sit
on my chin and be very loving, kiss
me in the mouth, and chirp away.
When he finds I am not going to open
my eyes or speak to him he will peck
and bite my eyes, nose, ears, cheeks,
and lips, and I assure you they are not
love bites either. Then again, when he
wants to sit on my shoulder and I prefer
he should sit on my hand, he will
fly up every time I take him down, and
bite hard at my hand, and for such a
little bird he has a very big bite and a
very fierce look.</p>

<p>He loves to visit my mother in her
room, and is very happy walking all
over her and on her head, but she has
never yet been able to touch him. He
seems to have eyes all over his head,
for, no matter how careful she is, he
always sees the finger. He thoroughly
enjoys my squeezing him in my hand,
and kissing him over and over again.</p>

<p>No doubt long ere this my readers
have been wondering what kind of a
bird Little Billee is, but that is a question
which has not yet been answered.
But I love Little Billee so dearly that
it makes little difference to me what
his nationality is or whether his ancestors
came over in the Mayflower,
fought in the American revolution, or
whether, like Topsy, he "just growed."
It was amusing to see Little Billee
the first time he heard the piano.
One morning two friends came to see
me, and while one of them played I
lay on the sofa with Little Billee cuddled
up in my neck. At first he was
very much afraid and did not know
what to make of the music. Soon he
became charmed (as everyone does
who hears exquisite playing) and
craned his little neck way out, opened
his bill, as if he were drinking in the
sound, then reached around, kissed
me in the mouth, snuggled down again,
for a few minutes, and repeated it as
long as she played.</p>

<p>One morning I saw Little Billee lying
on the floor before an open window
with his neck stretched out and bill
wide opened. I thought he was dying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
picked him up, but found him as lively
as ever. When he did the same thing
over again I understood he was taking
a sun bath, and now he takes one every
morning. One morning it was quite
cold when we came in from our walk,
and I sat down in front of the fire with
Little Billee on my knee. It was
amusing to see him put his head on
one side, open his bill and drink in the
warm air. For six weeks he strongly
objected to taking a water bath, and I
really suppose he was too young and
knew best. I left a little dish for several
days on the floor by the side of his
cage, but he was very careful not to go
near it. One morning everything was
very quiet, I on my bed and Little Billee
playing about the room. Soon he
went to the dish, looked in all four
corners, came back to the first one, put
his bill in just a little way, then went
the rounds; did it all over again, putting
his bill in a little further, and
shaking off the water. After debating
a long time he got on the edge of the
dish, put his head in until it was all wet,
then screwed up all his courage and
in he went. Such a droll little figure
as he cut, standing there with his body
and head held as high as he could get
them, his wings out just a little, not
knowing what to do next. All I could
think of was a very timid child going
in wading for the first time, with long
thin legs, very short frock, and arms
akimbo. His fear soon left him, and
he was bathing like an old stager.
When he finished he got out, gave himself
two or three good shakes, then
came over to the bed, and asked me to
take him. I did him up in my handkerchief,
but that did not suit him at
all. I could not do anything with him,
until I let him get on my bare neck, and
covered him with the trimming of my
robe <i>de nuit</i>. He was soaking wet and
shivering like a person having a hard
chill. He kept very still until his
feathers were dry enough to be dressed.
Such shaking, dressing of feathers, and
prinking I never saw. When his toilet
was made to suit him he nestled down
under my chin, and we both slept for an
hour. Every day we go through the
same performance after the bath. One
day I wanted to do something in my
dressing-room, so thought Little Billee
could take his bath and dry himself.
Soon I began to hear very mournful
peeps, and I came out to find Little
Billee, soaking wet, standing in front of
my bed, thinking I was there and teasing
for me to take him. Of course I
could not resist such pleading, so to bed
we went. I know I am completely spoiling
him, but he is such a dear no one
could help it.</p>

<p>Little Billee has taken a great interest
in this tale, and when I write is
always on my shoulder, arm or hand.
His favorite place to sit is on my left
hand between my first finger and thumb,
as they hold my portfolio on my lap,
and peck at my paper and pen. One
day he took the pen full of ink into his
bill then threw the ink all over my
paper. Little Billee has great fun taking
the paper off from the bottom of
his cage, and carrying it all about the
room, and will take it out as fast as I
put it in. The other day he went into
his cage, took the furthest corner of
the paper in his bill, backed out bringing
the paper over his head until it was
all on the floor, then went over to the
opposite corner, took that in his bill,
backed off the paper until he came to
the end, then went around in a circle
like the wind, for perhaps a dozen times,
with the paper perfectly straight out
just like a sail. After a few moments I
put the paper back, he took it right out
in the same way and did it all over again.</p>

<p>A number of weeks have passed since
I began Little Billee's biography. He
grows more wonderful every day, and
his devotion to me is simply marvelous.
Every day he does some new
cunning thing and seems to understand
everything I say to him.</p>

<p>The other day he would not come to
me when I put down my hand, but ran
across the room. After trying for
some time to make him mind, I got
up and said, "Billee, I am going away
and leave you," and started out into
the hall. He came chasing after me,
and now will always do it when I tell
him I am going to leave him. If I go
out of my room and tell him he <i>cannot</i>
go, he will sit on a chair by an open
window or play about on the floor for
an hour at a time, and never think of
flying out of the window or going out
of the door.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE sandhill crane is so often
confused, in the popular mind,
with the great blue heron,
that it may not be amiss to suggest
the real differences between them.
We should first remember that the
crane is not found east of Illinois, except
casually or accidentally, but is
numerous from Illinois westward to the
western border of the plains during the
migrations. It ranges as far north as
Manitoba. The great blue heron is
pretty evenly distributed over the
whole of North America. The cranes
usually, if not always, migrate in greater
or lesser flocks, alternately circling
upward to considerable heights and
sailing straight away, with both soaring
and flapping motion, and with prodigious
croakings. The herons migrate
singly or in pairs, with long,
steady sweep of the wings, and make
no outcry. Close at hand the two species
would hardly be confused by an
ordinarily careful observer, but these
large birds are rarely seen close at
hand.</p>

<p>The feeding habits of the two birds
are very similar, and to this superficial
similarity is largely due the confusion,
I suspect. Both wade into the water
searching for some hapless frog or toad,
often standing motionless for minutes
at a time until the victim comes within
range of the sharply-pointed beak, when
a lightning-like movement of the head
sends the beak completely through the
creature, killing and capturing it with
one stroke. The long legs and neck
are admirably adapted to this kind of
fishing.</p>

<p>Colonel N. S. Goss describes the
courting antics of these ungainly birds
as extremely ludicrous at times. A
veritable Indian war dance, in fact, in
which the females join heartily, and
like the war dance, stopping only when
the last participant falls down with
exhaustion. It seems to be a sort of
promiscuous wedding ceremony for the
whole company.</p>

<p>The crane nests on the dry, flat
prairie, usually scraping together some
wisps of dry grass, but often with not
even this poor excuse for a nest. Here
two to four drab-brown colored, rough-shelled
eggs are laid and the young
reared.</p>

<p>Size seems to be the only criterion
which determines what the crane may
eat. Perhaps it might better be said,
what he will swallow. He seems to
relish stones, pocket-knives, steel nails
and the like fully as well as the choicest
bit of frog or toad. Like many
other birds, however, he regurgitates
the indigestible matter, and so takes
no harm from this promiscuous diet.
Many of us may have reason to envy
him this capacity.</p>

<p>Dr. P. L. Hatch, in his "Birds of
Minnesota," gives an interesting description
of the fighting qualities of a
pet crane which he offered to pit
against any and all canines, one at a
time. One valiant mastiff, which essayed
to do battle with his craneship,
entered the ring with all the confidence
of an unbroken record of victories, but
a moment later he "stayed not on the
order of his going," carrying with him
the exact pattern of the crane's beak.
No other canines ever volunteered for
a similar service.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_LITTLE_BILLEE_2" id="THE_STORY_OF_LITTLE_BILLEE_2"></a>
  THE STORY OF LITTLE BILLEE.</h2>

<p>(<i>Continued from <a href="#Page_44">Page 44</a>.</i>)</p>

<p>I have succeeded far beyond my
expectations with Taffy and Little
Billee. It hurt me very much to be
obliged to punish Taffy when he would
spring at Little Billee, as Taffy and I
had been devoted to each other for two
years; still I did not want him to kill
my baby bird. One day Little Billee
was sitting on my knee dressing
his feathers and going through all
sorts of antics, while Taffy sat a
few feet away gazing at him with
longing eyes. I called to my maid to
bring Taffy and hold him on her lap,
and then let Little Billee peck and bite
his paws, ears, and nose, and a more
astonished cat I never saw. After we
let Taffy go he was found sitting on
the cellar stairs in a most dejected way
rubbing his nose with his paw. For
several days we did the same thing
until Taffy was afraid at sight of Little
Billee. One morning Taffy came to
bed with me, and lay on my arm while
Little Billee sat on my shoulder. Soon
Taffy put his chin on my chin, and Little
Billee came and sat close to my
cheek. Finally Taffy became so sleepy
he turned over, went fast asleep, and
Little Billee hopped down on his back,
and we lay that way for some time.
Since then almost every day Taffy will
lie on my lap, and Little Billee will sit
on his head, back, or on my knee and
dress his feathers. One day Little Billee
had the impertinence, while I had
them both on my lap, to reach out and
peck Taffy in the eye. That was a little
more than Taffy could endure, and
he reached out his paw and struck at
him. For over a week I could not get
Little Billee to go near him, but now
they are very good friends.</p>

<p>Little Billee enjoys going down
into the parlors to see visitors, but he
gives them to understand, the first
thing, they may look but they must not
touch. He will entertain them by hopping
all over me, kissing me in the
mouth and chirping at the top of his
voice. When it begins to get dark
Little Billee does not want to be off
from me a minute. If I have him
down stairs and put him on the floor he
will hop and fly after me from room to
room. The other day I left him in the
front parlor on a plant jar and went
into the dining-room and was gone
some little time. When I came back
there was no Little Billee to be found.
I called him by name and peeped to
him, but I could not get an answer.
As I went upstairs I called, "Where is
my Little Billee?" And he said, chirp,
chirp, chirp; and I found him in my
room eating his seeds and as happy as
possible.</p>

<p>Since then every day when he gets
tired of the parlors he goes upstairs,
for he seems to think my room is his
home. One day I watched him to see
how he went. He hopped from step
to step. When he reached the top
he flew into my room and lighted on
the top of his cage.</p>

<p>Little Billee is certainly not color-blind,
for he notices every little change
in my dress no matter how slight it is.
He had seen me for weeks in only my
robe <i>de nuit</i>, and wrapper. It was pitiable
to see him the first time he saw
me gowned in a white skirt and blue
waist. I had to lie down when I had
finished dressing and Little Billee came
over to the bed as usual and asked me
to take him. I put down my hand, he
hopped on my finger, but when he
looked up and saw the blue sleeve
away he went as if he had been shot
out of a cannon. He tried several
times but his courage always failed.
At last he gave up and went and sat in
a chair across the room, and it was two
days before he really liked the change.
Next I tried a pink waist with the
white skirt, but that seemed even worse
to him, which seemed very strange, as
he had seen me for days in a pink and
white wrapper.</p>

<p>My numerous friends will vouch for
the veracity of the story, as they all
think Little Billee is the most wonderful
bird they have ever seen. I only hope
my little sketch, told just as the things
have come to me, will give similar
pleasure to other invalids.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
