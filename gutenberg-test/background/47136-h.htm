<h2>
ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER
</h2>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
INTRODUCTION
</h3>

<p>
Schopenhauer differs from most other philosophers in
that he has influenced not only the development of the
history of thought, the course along which modern
philosophy has proceeded, but in that his views have
been welcomed as an inspiration, accepted almost in
the spirit of a religious faith by workers in quite other
departments of life.
</p>

<p>
No philosopher has so directly touched and influenced
the great art movements of modern times.  It is now
nearly one hundred years since the publication of his
greatest work, and his philosophy is a more potent and
vitalising force to-day than in his own lifetime.  It has
been a source of inspiration to artists and has directly
stimulated their creative activity, probably more than
any other abstract system has ever done.
</p>

<p>
Poetry has always been influenced subtly by
philosophy.  Spenser and Shelley are imbued through and
through with the doctrines of Plato.  Goethe wrote
some of his finest work under the spell of Spinoza, and
some of Wordsworth's deepest experiences were
interpreted to him through the ideas of Kant.  It is to all
artists, but especially to musicians, that Schopenhauer
makes his most intimate appeal.  For in his system
music plays a strangely important part, above and apart
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
from all the other arts.  In analysing its spiritual
character, he endows it with mystic significance.  One
famous instance of this influence is that of Wagner.
His acquaintance with Schopenhauer's philosophy
marked a turning-point in his artistic life.  It gave a
tremendous stimulus to his musical productivity, and
while under its influence he composed his greatest
works.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer's system expresses, according to his
own statement, only a single thought, viewed in
different aspects.  He considers it from the metaphysical,
æsthetic, and ethical points of view.  This fundamental
thought, which lies at the root of his entire philosophy,
is concerned with the significance of the will.  The will
alone gives the key to the understanding of man's
existence.  Every force in nature is to be regarded as
will, and the inner reality of the universe is to be found
only in will.
</p>

<p>
While it is especially to those who are concerned
with the problems arising out of the function and
significance of art that Schopenhauer offers such fruitful
and fascinating suggestions, the other aspects of his
system offer solutions in the sphere of ethics and
metaphysics of almost equally vital importance.  His
insistence on the significance of instinct and intuition
in all the lower and higher forms of life is of great
importance in the history of philosophy.  It is an aspect
of the subject which until later times had been strangely
neglected.  This prominence which is given to instinct
and intuition, is connected directly with his philosophy
of the will.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer, unlike most philosophers, has always
been read and appreciated by the general reader and
student of life, as distinguished from the specialised
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
student of philosophy.  His fundamental attitude
towards philosophy explains this to a great extent.
Notwithstanding his marked leaning towards mysticism, he
brought philosophy down to earth, and into relation
with, the actual facts of life.  He exchanged abstractions
for realities.  Philosophy had always been far too much
concerned, he maintained, with abstract conceptions,
and the philosopher had tended too exclusively to be
a mere man of books and learning.  The true philosopher,
on the contrary, should be a guide to fine living
as well as to high thinking.
</p>

<p>
Philosophy should express the real life of things.  But
the deepest things in life are not known by way of the
intellect, but are lived and felt.  The profoundest
truths of life we know intuitively and directly, with a
deeper certainty than the understanding can give.
</p>

<p>
That Schopenhauer has a wider public than have
most philosophers is due partly to his style.  He writes
in language so singularly clear and lucid, that it can be
followed easily by the general reader, not specially
trained in a technical philosophical vocabulary.  Of all
German philosophers he is the greatest from a literary
point of view.  "The true philosopher," he writes,
"will always seek after light and clearness, and will
endeavour to resemble a Swiss lake, which through its
peacefulness is able to unite great depth with great
clearness, the depth revealing itself precisely by the
clearness, rather than a turbid, impetuous mountain
torrent."  Philosophers have not always given much
heed to this counsel of perfection.  Obscurity of
expression is merely the cloak in which men seek to hide
their poverty of thought and triteness of mind.
"Everyone," says Schopenhauer, "who possesses a beautiful
and rich mind will always express himself in the most
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
natural, direct, and simple way, concerned to
communicate his thoughts to others and thus relieve the
loneliness that he must feel in such a world as this."
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer is a temperamental pessimist.  In
words of glowing and passionate eloquence he sets out
to prove that all life is essentially sorrow.  From his
earliest days he had been abnormally sensitive to the
misery that lies beneath the surface of life.  Pain is
essential to life and cannot be evaded.  If it can find
entrance in no other form, then it comes in the sad, grey
garments of tedium and ennui.
</p>

<p>
The purest joy in life is that which lifts us out of our
daily existence, and transforms us into disinterested
spectators of it.  This "divine release from the common
ways of men" can only be found through art.  But
even this release, which is accessible only to the few,
increases the capacity for suffering.
</p>

<p>
The final and only permanent solution of life is to be
found in the life of the saint.  True morality passes
through virtue, which is rooted in sympathy, into
asceticism.  Art gives a marvellous consolation in life,
but renunciation and self-surrender offer a complete
release from the terrors and evils of existence.  The
veil of Mâyâ&mdash;the web of illusion&mdash;is lifted from man's
eyes.  He now shudders at the pleasures which recognise
the assertion of life, and attains to the state of
voluntary renunciation, resignation, and true indifference.
Buddhism, Schopenhauer maintained, comes nearest
of all religions to expressing this truth.  It is here that
he shows how profoundly Indian philosophy and
religion had influenced him.
</p>

<p>
Throughout his life Schopenhauer was aggressively
hostile towards all contemporary philosophers.  To some
extent, no doubt, his own failure to obtain academic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
recognition embittered him.  But partly his attitude
may be explained by the complete difference of method
between them.  Schopenhauer cares nothing at all
about method.  To Hegel and his contemporaries
method was all-important.  The historical method was
the pathway which was followed with most enthusiasm
at the time.  It is especially for the historical method
that Schopenhauer has the frankest contempt.  Hegel
and others were attempting to interpret present reality
through history, seeking to show that through the slow
process of history, unfolding itself in time, are revealed
the organic principles which underlie the whole of life.
Schopenhauer attaches practically no value to history
as a highroad for philosophical inquiry.  This way, he
says, lie merely the dry bones of archæology and
antiquarianism.  To examine things historically is to look
along a horizontal line.  To think philosophically is to
look along a vertical line.  The latter is the rational
and the more profound point of view.  "What history
narrates is in fact only the long, heavy, and confused
dream of humanity."  It is our inmost consciousness
which is the real concern of the philosopher.  "The
true philosophy of history," he says, "consists in the
insight into the causes of all these endless changes
and their confusion.  We have always before us the
same even, unchanging nature, which to-day acts in
the same way as yesterday.  Thus it ought to recognise
the identical in all events, in ancient as in modern
times, in the East as in the West, and in spite of all
difference in special circumstances, of costume and of
custom, to see everywhere the same humanity.  If one
has read Herodotus, then in a philosophical regard one
has read enough history.  For everything is already there
that makes up the subsequent history of the world."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
</p>

<p>
That which is significant in itself, not in its relations,
is to be found far more profoundly and distinctly in
poetry than in history.  There is, therefore, far more
real, inner truth in poetry than in history.  Aristotle
held the same view, maintaining that poetry reveals
a higher truth than history, for it strives to express
the universal.  "Poetry," he says, "is a more
philosophical, and a higher thing than history."
</p>

<p>
In Schopenhauer's view, the true philosopher is the
genius.  His penetrative imagination will see farther
and deeper than the learning of the mere scholar.  The
genius is a clear mirror of the inner nature of the
universe.  To him knowledge is the sun which reveals
the world.  His work may be regarded as an inspiration,
as an interpretation of the spirit of beauty in art.
He has been endowed by nature with a special faculty
of inner vision, and uses his power to open the eyes of
ordinary men.  It is the genius who knows the inner
nature of things, just as in Plato true philosophers are
defined as "the lovers of the vision of truth, who are
able to distinguish the idea from the objects which
participate in the idea, and whose eyes are ever directed
towards fixed and immutable principles."  It is the
genius, says Schopenhauer, who interprets his vision
to the rest of mankind.  He enables us to see the world
through his eyes.
</p>

<p>
There was a wide difference, too, between Schopenhauer
and other contemporary philosophers, in their
attitude towards religion.  Schopenhauer's freedom
from academic fetters enabled him to steer an
independent way.  The German university professor was
almost always dominated by the need for reconciling
his philosophical theories with a theological creed.  At
times to square accounts between the two involved
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
considerable ingenuity, as in the case of Kant.  To
Schopenhauer, to whom orthodox religion had always been
a mere form, such attempts savoured of hypocrisy.
Hence he always speaks slightingly of
"philosophy-professors," and throughout his writings he makes
bitter attacks upon them.  Hegel's work is described
as three-fourths utter absurdity, and one quarter as
paradox, and he himself alluded to as "that intellectual
Caliban."  Plato's contempt for the sophists stands on
very much the same plane of thought.
</p>

<p>
In spite of this attitude there is much in Schopenhauer's
system, which is closely akin to Christianity on its
mystical side.  In his ethical theory he shows
extraordinary points of agreement with the mediæval mystics.
Materialism was utterly alien to his spirit.  Materialists,
he said, possess neither humanities nor culture, and their
point of view filled him with the Olympian laughter of
the gods.  He always maintained that his theory of
pessimism was more truly Christian, and more closely
in accord with the spirit of primitive Christianity than
the shallow optimism which crept into the later developments
of that system.  Its ascetic spirit he considered
the kernel of Christianity.  Protestantism represented
for him a falling away from the earlier and purer form,
and a transition to shallow rationalism.
</p>

<p>
His thought was much influenced by ancient Indian
philosophy, and especially by Buddhism.  The
Upanishads had been published in Germany in 1801 in a
Latin translation from a Persian version of the Sanscrit
original.  In these treatises are set forth the general
system of mystical pantheism, which grew out of the
more theosophic elements of the Vedas.  In reading
them Schopenhauer immediately acknowledged a
kindred spirit.  In speaking of this work he says, "How
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
does everyone who by diligent reading has familiarised
himself with this incomparable book, feel himself
stirred to the innermost by that spirit.  The mind is
here washed clean of all its early ingrafted superstition,
and all philosophy servile to that superstition.  It is
the most profitable and the most elevating reading
which is possible in the world.  It has been the consolation
of my life, and will be the consolation of my death."

CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
SCHOPENHAUER'S LIFE
</p>

<p>
Arthur Schopenhauer led the outwardly uneventful
life of a scholar and a thinker, taking no part in public
affairs.  The great movements in European history,
through which he lived, left him untroubled and
unmoved in his scholar's seclusion.  There is little
therefore to chronicle with regard to the outer history of his
life.  It is the more easy to escape the criticism of
Schopenhauer himself, who says that "those who,
instead of studying the thoughts of a philosopher,
make themselves acquainted with his life and history,
are like people who instead of occupying themselves
with a picture, are rather occupied with its frame,
reflecting on the taste of its carving and the nature of its
gilding."
</p>

<p>
The little that there is to tell is, however, of great
significance with regard to the development of his
thought.  For of no philosopher can it be more truly
said than of Schopenhauer, that his thought is the
expression of his character.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer was born at Dantzig on February 22,
1788.  He traced his descent through both parents to
Dutch ancestors.  The family had settled at Dantzig
in the course of commerce.  For several generations
the head of the family had combined the career of a
merchant with landed pursuits.  Schopenhauer's
great-grandfather, Andreas Schopenhauer, leased one of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
large farms belonging to the municipality, while
following the business of a merchant.  His son Andreas
acquired property near Dantzig, and there the father
of the philosopher, Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer, was
born.  Some mental weakness seems to have been
inherited.  The eldest son of Andreas was an imbecile
from his youth, and the other children, with the
exception of Schopenhauer's father, all had some curious
mental or moral twist.  Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer,
however, was a man of strong intelligence and character.
He followed a merchant's career with great success,
raising his firm to the first position in the town.  He
was a disciple of the school of Voltaire, read French
and English literature, and had a keen admiration for
English life and institutions.  His wife, Johanna,
belonged, too, to one of the leading families of Dantzig.
She had been educated on broader lines than was usual
for girls at the time, and had a love for art and letters
which extended her interests beyond the domestic
concerns of her home.  Later on, during her widowhood,
these were to find a wider field and opportunity, and
she became a well-known authoress in the Germany of
her day.  She married in 1785, at the age of eighteen,
being twenty years younger than her husband.  The
marriage was an unhappy one, owing to differences of
temperament.  There were two children of the marriage.
They suffered for the incompatibilities of their parents.
Both were burdened with abnormally strong desires
for the pleasures of life, together with an extraordinary
capacity for suffering.
</p>

<p>
Arthur, the future philosopher, was the first child of
the marriage.  He was given the name of Arthur to
satisfy the cosmopolitanism of his father, the name
being spelt alike in several languages.  His earliest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
years were spent at the country house near Dantzig,
or at the farm, between the sea and the pine-woods,
which had been rented many years before by his
great-grandfather.
</p>

<p>
In 1793, when Schopenhauer was five years old, the
family migrated to Hamburg.  The "free city" of
Dantzig, which had a constitution of its own, was
annexed by Prussia in 1793, at the second partition of
Poland, and Heinrich Schopenhauer was too stern a
republican to adapt himself to the new rule.  He carried
on his business in Hamburg for the next twelve years,
but never became a naturalised citizen.
</p>

<p>
He had resolved that his son should follow the family
career of a merchant, and his education was planned
accordingly on those lines.  He was taken to France in
1797, and left at Havre for two years.  For the next
three years he attended a private school at Hamburg.
During this time, discontent with his father's plans for
his future was gradually ripening within him.  To
reconcile him, he was promised a trip to France and
England, on the condition that he promised to give up
his own desires and ambitions, and to be loyal to his
father's wishes.  The prospect of the journey was too
alluring, and he gave the required promise.  After six
weeks had been spent in London, his parents left him
at a boarding-school at Wimbledon.  In letters to his
mother, he complains of the mechanical instruction,
the dreary Sunday services, and the tedious routine of
the school.  She, in reply, warns him not to give way to
bombast and empty pathos.
</p>

<p>
He became proficient in English, and always held
English character and intelligence in admiration,
although he was impressed by the prevalent hypocrisy
and the oppressive pietism of the time.  He was busy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
already recording his impressions, describing
characteristically the feelings and ideas awakened in him
rather than the actual facts and events.  The travellers
returned through France, from Geneva to Vienna, and
thence to Berlin.
</p>

<p>
For about four months Schopenhauer now worked in
a Dantzig office, trying to acquire the rudiments of a
business training.  When almost seventeen, he entered
the employment of a firm in Hamburg.  He himself
has recorded that there never was a worse clerk in a
merchant's office.  In his leisure, and during office hours
whenever possible, he was reading voraciously.
</p>

<p>
In 1805 his father died, whether by accident or by
his own hand remains uncertain.  For two years
longer Schopenhauer stuck to his hated task, out of
loyalty to his father, and the promise made him some
years earlier.  But at last he could stifle his ambitions
and yearnings towards a purely intellectual life no
longer, and he obtained his mother's consent to leave
his office, and to begin preparation for a learned career.
</p>

<p>
His mother meanwhile, with her daughter Adèle, had
left Hamburg and settled at Weimar, at that time the
intellectual centre of Germany.  Goethe was here the
sun round which the lesser lights of the artistic and
intellectual world revolved.  At the age of forty,
Johanna Schopenhauer had entered on a new life, and
was finding scope and free development for untried
capabilities.  She played a prominent part in the social
life of the place, and her receptions were remarkable
for the circle she gathered round her.  Goethe himself
was a frequent visitor there.  She also took part in the
theatrical performances, which were so conspicuous a
feature of the life at Weimar.  With help and
encouragement from Fernow, a distinguished scholar and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
art critic, she began to write, and published with
considerable popular success travel sketches, art
biographies, and novels.  Her daughter, in describing
their life at Weimar, tells how her mother experienced
ever fresh delight in intercourse with the famous men
living there.  "She was liked, her society was
agreeable.  Her pleasing manners made her house a centre
of intellectual activity, where everyone felt at home,
and freely contributed the best he had to bring."  Besides
Goethe, Schlegel, Grimm, Wieland and others were
frequent guests under her roof.  Freed from his hated
bondage, Schopenhauer now left Hamburg and entered
the gymnasium, or grammar school, at Gotha, but a
lampoon on one of the masters was so resented that
he was obliged to leave.  He then came to Weimar,
at his mother's suggestion, and worked at classics in
the house of a well-known scholar, who had a real
enthusiasm for all things Greek.  Something of his spirit
he communicated to his pupil, and the passion for
Greek art and thought grew into a moulding principle
in Schopenhauer's views of life and religion.  At the
same time that he was entering into the spirit of classical
literature, he was cultivating his musical ability, and
thus feeling his way towards a full and intense
understanding of the art, which entered later with such
significance into the development of his philosophy.
He was striving to realise an ideal of the fullest and
most complete culture, in which not only the life of
thought, but also the life of art should find consummate
satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
The estrangement between his mother and himself
began to widen now that they were thrown constantly
together.  By arrangement, he dined daily with her,
and came to her receptions.  But Schopenhauer was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
too uncontrolled in his temper, and too uncompromising
in his egoism to make an agreeable companion.  His
mother, driven to write to him, asserts that his constant
grumbling, gloomy looks, and intolerant dogmatism
depress her.  It is necessary to her happiness to know
that he is happy, but not necessary that she should be a
witness to it.  Therefore, if they are to agree they must
consent to live apart.  Both mother and son were bent
on self-development, and in character were too
dissimilar to understand each other.  Schopenhauer was
jealous, uncontrolled in his moods, and boorish in his
manners.  That all-consuming egoism, which all his
life spoiled his relations with everyone with whom he
came in contact, made a congenial family life
impossible.  He resented his mother's freedom and
independence, and insulted her friends.  In a way that is
very characteristic of him, he generalises from his own
personal experience, and in his views on women we
find reflected all the bitterness which had grown round
the relations between himself and his mother.
</p>

<p>
In 1809 he attained his majority, and received his
share of his father's fortune, amounting to about £150
a year.  He was now independent, and could pursue
the career he had marked out for himself.  He valued
all his life the liberty which this competency secured
him.  A draft dedication, intended for the second
edition of <i>The World as Will and Idea</i>, was addressed
"to the <i>manes</i> of my father.  Noble, beneficent spirit!
to whom I owe everything that I am....  As thou
didst bring into the world a son such as I am, thou
didst also make provision that in a world like this,
such a son should be able to subsist and to develop
himself....  In my mind the tendency to its only
proper vocation was too decidedly implanted to let me
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
do violence to my nature, and so to subjugate it that,
recking nought of existence in general, and active only
for my personal existence, it should find its sole task
in procuring daily bread....  Thou seemest to have
foreseen that thy son, thou proud republican, could
not possess the talent to compete in cringing
before ministers and councillors, Mæcenases, and their
advisers, basely to beg for the hard-earned piece of
bread, or to flatter self-conceited commonplaceness,
and humbly join himself to the eulogistic retinue of
bungling charlatans....  That I could expand the
forces nature gave me and apply them to their destined
purpose, that I could follow my natural instinct and
think and work for beings without number, while no
one does anything for me, for that I thank thee, my
father, thank thy activity, prudence, thrift, and
provision for the future."
</p>

<p>
In 1809 he entered the University of Göttingen as a
student of medicine.  In his second year he changed his
course to philosophy.  Wieland, the poet, on the
occasion of a visit from Schopenhauer, tried to dissuade
him from philosophy as a career.  The reply was,
"Life is a ticklish business.  I have decided to spend
it in reflecting on it."
</p>

<p>
In 1811 Schopenhauer left Göttingen, and entered
the University of Berlin.  Here, too, he gave special
attention to natural science.  Throughout his
notebooks are scattered critical remarks on his teachers
and their lectures.  Fichte especially was a butt for
his sarcasms.  Against a statement of Schleiermacher's,
that "No man can be a philosopher without being
religious," he writes, "No man who is religious takes to
philosophy: he does not need it."
</p>

<p>
The Napoleonic wars were at this time disorganising
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
the whole of Europe.  Berlin was in the hands of a
French garrison.  But after the disastrous campaign
of Napoleon in Russia, the entire nation rose against
the invader.  University classes were broken up.
Fichte stayed behind to nurse the wounded, and died
next year at his post.  Schopenhauer, a prey to fears,
which tormented him all his life, fled for safety to
Dresden.  He settled finally at Rudolstadt, and wrote
there an essay, to qualify for the degree of doctor of
philosophy at Jena.  This he obtained, and his essay
was published as <i>A Philosophical Treatise on the
Four-fold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason</i>.  This
work he describes in his later books as a preliminary
part of his system, which must be studied if
the remainder is to be understood.  It is written
entirely under the influence of Kant.  The title refers
to the four branches of knowledge: physical science,
mathematics, logic, and ethics.
</p>

<p>
After the publication of his book, Schopenhauer
returned to Weimar, and stayed for a few months with
his mother.  The experiment resulted in complete
estrangement.  He was overbearing and dogmatic,
insulting his mother's friends, and censorious towards
herself.  She wrote to him again, to avoid an
unpleasant personal interview, and complained of his
contemptuous bearing and peremptory manner.  He
left Weimar and never saw his mother again, although
she lived for twenty-four years after their separation.
It is a curious commentary on his relations to his
parents, that his highest praise of his father lay in the
fact that he had, by his thrift, left his son an adequate
income; and that his main censure on his mother is
that she spends her money too negligently.
</p>

<p>
His visits to his mother at Weimar were of considerable
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
importance in the subsequent development of his
thought, for it was there that he made the acquaintance,
not only of Goethe, who influenced him profoundly for
a time, but also of F. Mayer, the orientalist, who
directed his attention to the philosophical literature of
ancient India.  This literature left a permanent mark
upon his mind.
</p>

<p>
For the next four years he lived at Dresden.  In 1816
he published an essay <i>On Vision and Colours</i>, which
has reference to the controversy which Goethe was
waging on the theory of light.  Schopenhauer's theory
is fantastic.  It is not submitted to experimental
evidence, and rests, as he admits, on "intuitive"
certainty.
</p>

<p>
This early work is hardly in the direct line of the
development of Schopenhauer's thought.  It is really
a deviation, for which Goethe's all-compelling influence
is responsible.  Goethe was at first inclined to regard
Schopenhauer as an opponent, for the essay is rather a
transformation of Goethe's theory than an expansion of it.
</p>

<p>
His residence at Dresden was the best he could have
chosen from the point of view of his own system of
philosophy.  Here he could study better than in almost
any other town of Europe the works of art, in which he
was to see a revelation of the meaning of life.  The art
collections of the town are among the most famous in
Europe, and the music, both operatic and orchestral,
was then, as now, of the highest quality.  In this home
of art, Schopenhauer's great system was now taking shape.
</p>

<p>
During his daily walks along the banks of the Elbe,
he was thinking out his theories, making notes
occasionally in a note-book, and then striding on again
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
with the rapid pace by which he was recognised even as
an old man.
</p>

<p>
More and more strongly it was borne in upon him
that "inward discord is the very law of human nature."  All
his life his thoughts had struck the note of genuine
pessimism.  He was always in revolt against the pain
and misery that lie hidden beneath the surface of life.
That this pessimistic bias was fundamentally one of
temperament, there can be no doubt.  In letters to
him from his mother, we find her constantly urging
him, even as a child, to look upon the brighter side of
things.  In a letter written to him in 1806, she writes,
"I could tell you things that would make your hair
stand on end, but I refrain, for I know how you love to
brood over human misery in any case."
</p>

<p>
Even in happiness and success he recognised illusion.
Everywhere in nature we see strife and conflict.  One
species preys upon another.  The "will to live"
necessarily expresses itself as a struggle.
</p>

<p>
Hegel at this time reigned supreme in the kingdom
of philosophy.  It was hardly possible to escape his
influence.  Schopenhauer, in striving to give
expression to a system which would lay bare the real
inner nature of our life and destiny, was at the same
time protesting passionately against the Hegelian
view.  It was as a protest against the all-powerful
idealism of this philosophy that his system was directed
in the first place.  He represents a reaction against
the absorption of everything in reason.  As opposed
to this view, Schopenhauer urged the priority of the
will and the feelings as the fundamental factors in
determining the mental life.
</p>

<p>
The will is the reality behind all life.  The intellect
is merely a tool in the service of the will.  It is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
impossible to find in reason a complete knowledge of the
essence of the world.  A merely intellectual philosophy
of life is bound to be thin and hollow, and we
should aim rather at a clear and direct insight into life.
</p>

<p>
Now the will, into which every form of life can be
resolved, is the source of all human misery and
unhappiness.  The only way in which men can free
themselves from the bondage of the will, and throw off its
yoke, is by looking upon beauty.  It is in art that
eternal truth is revealed with a directness and certainty
to which science never attains.  This theory is
connected with the Platonic theory of Ideas.  The real
inner nature of things, the Ideas in the Platonic sense,
are revealed in creative and imaginative art.  The
faculty of vision, which enables men to divine this
reality behind appearances, and to interpret it to others,
is the gift of the artistic genius.  He "understands
the half-uttered speech of nature, and articulates clearly
what she only stammered forth."  The man of genius
produces works of art by intuitive insight.  He sees
through the outer shell to the inner significance that
lies at the heart of things.  Genius is the faculty of
renouncing entirely one's own personality for the time
being, so as to become clear vision of the world, free
of subjectivity.  The genius must have imagination,
above all things, in order to see in things not that
which nature has actually made, but that which she
endeavoured to make, but could not.
</p>

<p>
Art, however, does not deliver us permanently from
life, but only for moments.  It is therefore not a path
out of life, but only an occasional consolation in life.
</p>

<p>
It is the saint, who through the surrender of all
willing, through the intentional mortification of his
own desires, attains to true resignation.  Happiness
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
and unhappiness become then a matter of indifference,
and the spell of the illusion, which held us chained in
the bonds of this world, is broken for ever.
</p>

<p>
These were the views which found expression in
Schopenhauer's great work, <i>The World as Will and Idea</i>,
which was finished in 1818.  He found a publisher in
Brockhaus of Leipsic.  While the work was going
through the press, he attacked his publisher with such
violent rudeness, that Brockhaus wrote declining all
further correspondence with one "whose letters in
their supreme coarseness and rusticity savour more of
the cabman than of the philosopher."
</p>

<p>
The work appeared when Schopenhauer was thirty
years of age, an extraordinarily early date at which to
produce so complete and elaborate a system of philosophy.
In this work the outlines of his whole system
are permanently fixed.  The whole contains, he says,
but a single thought.  That thought exhibits itself as
metaphysics, æsthetics, and ethics.  He wrote later
many essays and supplements, but these all go towards
confirmation and expansion of his earlier work.  For the
rest of his life he was repeating his original theories,
with infinite variation in expression.  This is entirely
in accord with his own theory of age.  At thirty, he
maintained, the intellectual and moral endowment has
reached its highest development.  All that is done
later is to vary and expand the main principles already
laid down.
</p>

<p>
His book fell still-born from the press.  Twenty years
later he succeeded in getting his publishers to undertake
a second edition, but this too received but scant
recognition.  Schopenhauer had built great hopes on his
work, and his disappointment was bitter when no word
of notice greeted its appearance.  "I dread silence
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
about my system, as a burnt child dreads the fire," he
wrote on one occasion.  When bringing his manuscript
to the notice of the publisher, he had written that the
work "would hereafter be the source of a hundred
other books."  He confided to a disciple that upon
completing the work, he had felt so convinced that he
had solved the enigma of the world, that he had thought
of having his signet-ring carved with the image of the
sphinx throwing herself down the abyss.  "My
philosophy," he wrote, "is the real solution of the enigma
of the world.  In this sense it may be called a revelation."
</p>

<p>
Before the book appeared, Schopenhauer travelled
to Italy.  He first spent some weeks in Venice, where
Byron was living at the time.  The two, however, did
not meet.  He then set out for Rome, by way of Bologna
and Florence, and there he spent the winter.  His time
was spent mostly in the art collections, and in the study
of Italian.  He kept, as he always did in travelling, a
diary, recording not so much his observations on things
seen, as his moods and moralisings on them.
</p>

<p>
In May of the following year, as he was returning
home, he received the news of the bankruptcy of the
Dantzig house in which almost the entire means of his
mother and his sister were invested.  He himself had a
far smaller amount at stake.  The business arrangements
connected with the winding-up of the firm, which
his mother accepted, were not to Schopenhauer's taste,
and the estrangement between himself and his relatives
now became permanent.  He showed his usual promptness
to suspect evil, and his angry accusations were so
bitter, that a silence of eleven years fell between himself
and his mother and sister.  His struggle with the firm
in question lasted for two years.  Schopenhauer came
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
off triumphant financially, his capital with interest
being paid in full, whereas the other creditors obtained
only thirty per cent.
</p>

<p>
His great work having now been launched in the
philosophical world, Schopenhauer turned his thoughts
to the chances of an academic appointment.  After
many inquiries he decided finally on Berlin, and made
an application.  Specimen copies of his published
works were sent in, and a private trial lecture delivered.
Here in 1820 he began his career as assistant lecturer,
and a course of lectures was announced, of six hours a
week, on philosophy in general.  He chose as his lecture
hour the very time at which Hegel delivered his
principal course, thinking to enter into direct competition
with him, and carry off his students.  His hopes,
however, misled him.  The students were not to be beguiled
away from the omnipotent Hegel, and Schopenhauer's
course was a complete failure.  He was not a good
lecturer, and the course fell through before the end of
the term.  The lectures were never again delivered.
</p>

<p>
The six years he spent in Berlin were not in other
respects happy ones.  He was on bad terms with all his
colleagues, and even in his private life he contrived to
bring worry and legal trouble upon himself.  In a small
entrance hall, common ground to himself and another
lodger, he, one day, found three women engaged in
conversation.  He demanded their withdrawal.  Two
complied, but one, a sempstress lodging in the same
house, refused.  Thereupon Schopenhauer, stick in
hand, threw her forcibly twice out of the house.  She
fell, and on the following day brought her case before
the court.  After six months, the verdict went in
Schopenhauer's favour, but an appeal was lodged, and,
in his absence, the court inflicted a fine of twenty thalers,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
as compensation for injuries inflicted.  Some months
later the sempstress brought a further action.  She
claimed that her injuries were more serious than had
first appeared, and that she was now permanently
incapacitated for work.  Schopenhauer was condemned
to pay her sixty thalers a year as aliment, and
five-sixths of the costs of the case.  This sum he paid until
the time of her death, twenty years later.  On her
death certificate he wrote, "obit anus, abit onus."  The
episode throws light on the character of the philosopher,
with its marked strain of coarseness and ill-controlled
passion.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Schopenhauer continued to philosophise,
still hoping against hope for the university
professorship, which never came, but sustained by immense
self-confidence in the importance of his message.  He
lived at Berlin in absolute seclusion.  Social life had no
attractions for him.  He was a constant visitor to the
theatre, the opera-house, and the concert-room, and at
home his flute was a constant diversion.  These were
his chief distractions.
</p>

<p>
From time to time the thought of marriage had
entered into his plans, but his habits of solitude were
growing stronger, and his cynical views on women were
obtaining an ever firmer hold on his mind.  His nature
was strongly sensual, and intermittent amorous
experience is not the best school in which to foster the
growth of fine feeling or noble thoughts on the relations
of the sexes.  It is not surprising to find, therefore, in
his views on women the unmistakable stamp of his
personal experience, a fatal blindness to all but the
physical side of sex.  The subject is not one that he
passes over with indifference, for it amounts almost to
an obsession with him.  He left behind him notes on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
love and marriage, which were held by his literary
executor to be unfit for publication, and these were
burned accordingly.
</p>

<p>
It was during these years at Berlin, embittered by
the lack of recognition of his philosophical work, and by
his failure in the academic world, that his attacks on
university professors grew so virulent.  He attributed
his failure in both respects to conspiracy on the part of
those in power.  His attacks on Hegel grew ever fiercer.
</p>

<p>
In 1829 he was anxious to undertake a translation
into English of Kant's chief works.  He wrote to the
publishers, urging his claims, saying "a century may
pass before there shall again meet in the same head so
much Kantian philosophy with so much English, as
happen to dwell together in mine."  The proposal came
to nothing, and Kant's <i>Critique</i> had to wait for nearly
ten years longer before it appeared in an English form.
</p>

<p>
In 1831 the cholera broke out in Berlin, and Schopenhauer
immediately took to flight.  Hegel was one of
the victims of this outbreak.  In one of his later works,
Schopenhauer describes how he had been moved to
leave Berlin, on the entry of the cholera, by means of
a dream.  He had dreamed of a little schoolfellow and
playmate, who died in childhood, "It may have
been," he says, "of hypothetical truth, a warning in
short, that if I had remained, I should have died of the
cholera.  Immediately after my arrival in Frankfurt,
I was the subject of a perfectly distinct apparition, as I
believe, of my parents, and signifying that I should
survive my mother, who was still alive; my father,
already deceased, carried a light in his hand."  This is
significant, as showing Schopenhauer's belief in the
supernatural, and in mystical influences.
</p>

<p>
After leaving Berlin, Schopenhauer settled at Frankfurt,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
and with the exception of one year, which was
spent at Mannheim, he lived there until his death
twenty-seven years later.  For twenty years after
coming to Frankfurt he lived in entire isolation.  Now
and again, at rare intervals, an article from his pen
appeared, but this is the only sign of life.  We hear
nothing of his personal life during this period.  Friends he
seems to have had none, and all personal intercourse
with acquaintances invariably came to an abrupt end,
owing to his intolerant attitude towards those who
dared to disagree with any of his views.
</p>

<p>
Only when he reaches the verge of old age do we
once again have some record of him.  This latter part
of his life was spent with unvaried regularity.  His
chief occupation and solace is philosophy.  His daily
routine was mapped out, according to a regular plan,
which hardly varied from day to day.  He worked
during the forenoon for three or four hours.  At noon
he enjoyed half an hour's relaxation on the flute.  He
dined daily at a hotel.  After an hour's rest, the
afternoon was given up to lighter literature.  His favourite
authors, among poets, were Petrarch, Shakespeare, and
Calderon.  The study of the great classical writers
was all his life his greatest delight.  The degradation
in style of contemporary literature, which he
constantly bemoaned, he held to be due largely to the
neglect of classical literature.  "Without Latin," he
wrote, "a man must be content to be counted amongst
the vulgar."  He regretted the disuse of the Latin
language as a means of communication between
scholars.  Apart altogether from the educational value
of the classics, he thought no other literature afforded
the same refreshment and enjoyment for the mind.
To take one of the classics in one's hand, even for half
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
an hour, is to feel refreshed, purified, elevated, and
strengthened, exactly as if one had drunk from a fresh
rock spring.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon, whatever the weather, Schopenhauer
took his daily walk, together with his dog, his
invariable companion.  The two were well-known
figures in Frankfurt, as they took their customary
exercise together.  Schopenhauer's devotion to his
dog was boundless.  For the animal world altogether
he had a special tenderness, pitying animals as the
tortured souls of the earth, and holding that in all
essentials they are the same as man.  He condemned
vivisection, on the ground that animals have rights.
</p>

<p>
For two hours he took his customary walk, at a rapid
pace, in accordance with his theory that quick movement
is essential to health.  Then he visited the reading-room
of the town, never omitting to look through the
<i>Times</i>.  The evening was spent frequently at the
theatre, or in the concert-room.  In his later years,
his growing deafness robbed him of much of the
pleasure which he had always won from music.  On
returning home, he read for an hour, and then retired
to rest.  All his life he was afraid of robbers, and took
extraordinary precautions against them.  He slept
invariably with loaded weapons by his bedside, and his
valuables were hidden away with great ingenuity in
various corners of his rooms.  He believed that a
thinker needed more than the ordinary amount of sleep
to recuperate after the day's labours.  His rule of life
was modelled on that of Kant, but of Kant's early rising
he strongly disapproved, believing it to be a reckless
waste of vital energy.
</p>

<p>
Thus the latter part of his life is occupied with careful
rules for the preservation of his health, which was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
naturally robust.  The contradiction is at once obvious
between his actual mode of life and his own moral
ideal, as set forth in his works.  Some of his most
eloquent writing is on the subject of holiness, attained
through renunciation and self-denial.  Poverty,
chastity, and constant mortification of the will are the
ways along which man must travel to gain the highest
moral solution of life.  Schopenhauer was perfectly
conscious of this contradiction between his ideals and
his own way of life.  But, he says, it is just as little
needful that a saint should be a philosopher, as that a
philosopher should be a saint.  In the same way, it is
not necessary that a perfectly beautiful man should
be a great sculptor, or that a great sculptor should
himself be a beautiful man.  It is a strange demand,
that a moralist should teach no other virtue than that
which he himself possesses.
</p>

<p>
After 1818, when <i>The World as Will and Idea</i>
appeared, he published nothing further until 1836.  In
that year, a small book called <i>On the Will in Nature</i>
appeared.  It was described on the title-page as "a
discussion of the corroborations which the philosophy
of the author has, since its first appearance, received at
the hands of empirical science."  During these eighteen
years, in which no new work of his was published, he
had been collecting from all that he read, or saw, or
heard, everything that could in any way be brought
to bear as evidence towards the proof of his main
theories and principles.  Especially had he been on the
alert with regard to scientific investigation, believing
that his own sceptical generation would be most strongly
influenced by anything that science could bring forward
as confirmation of his metaphysical principles.  Physics,
he thought, had arrived at the point where it touches
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
metaphysics.  He was now confident that the time for
his philosophy was ripening.  But in spite of this
confidence, the book met with no more recognition than had
his previous works.
</p>

<p>
In 1838 he competed successfully for a prize offered
by the Scientific Society of Drontheim, in Norway, for
the best essay on the question "whether free-will could
be proved from the evidence of consciousness."  The
subject could not have been more happily chosen to
suit him.  His essay won the prize, and he was elected
a member of the Society.  He obtained permission from
the Society to publish his essay in Germany.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile he was competing for another prize,
offered by the Royal Danish Academy of the Sciences,
at Copenhagen, on the subject of the sources or the basis
of morality.  He was confident of success, and wrote
to the Academy asking that the award might be
speedily made public, as he proposed to publish his
essay along with the one which had been successful
in Norway.  His confidence was premature, for when
the Danish Academy made known its decision, it
announced that Schopenhauer's essay was the only one
sent in, but that it was unworthy of the prize on several
grounds, one of which was, that several of the chief
philosophers had been treated with contempt.
</p>

<p>
From this time his rage against the three philosophers,
Hegel, Fichte, and Schelling, knows no bounds.
He attributed his failure to win recognition to a
conspiracy among them and their followers.  His writings
abound in violent invective against them.  In several
ways there are points of contact between the system
of Schopenhauer and that of Hegel, but Schopenhauer
refused to admit any kinship between them.
</p>

<p>
His two treatises were published together, as he had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
intended.  They appeared in 1841 as <i>The Two Fundamental
Problems of Ethics</i>.  These two problems are the
freedom of the will and the basis of morality.  The
treatment is little more than an expansion of the theories
set forth in his chief work.  He finds the roots of
morality in sympathy.  The sense of brotherhood,
which binds together individual and individual, and
welds them into an organic whole, is the foundation on
which all the moral sentiments are built.  All goodness,
love, virtue, and nobility of character spring from the
same source, from sympathy, which is the same in its
nature as pure love.  Beyond the egoism, which is
fostered by the world around us, there exists also the
principle of altruism, impelling men to self-sacrifice,
unselfishness, and devotion.
</p>

<p>
The second edition of <i>The World as Will and Idea</i>,
which appeared in 1844, seemed at first as likely to
fail of attaining recognition as the earlier one.  But a
change was now at hand.  The reign of optimistic
pantheism was approaching its end in Germany.  The
lofty idealism, which was the strength of the dominant
school of thought, and which found political expression
in the revolutionary movements of 1848, was now
followed by a wave of reaction.  The democratic
movement, after obtaining some temporary triumphs, was
checked completely for the time, and a wave of weariness
and discouragement passed over the country.  Schopenhauer
looked on, while Frankfurt was torn violently
asunder in the throes of its revolution.  His sentiments
were against the democratic party, and he seems to
have feared, above all else, the possibility of losing his
private means.  In letters written at this time to his
friends, Schopenhauer expresses his dislike and
disapproval of the great national movement of 1848.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
was a thorough-going individualist, and the movement,
which stirred to the depths the finest natures of the
time, found no response in Schopenhauer's heart.  His
room was used by Austrian soldiers, who shot from the
windows upon the democrats below.
</p>

<p>
His political views are expressed again in his will,
made in 1852, in which Schopenhauer left the greater
part of his estate to be spent for the benefit of the
soldiers who had been wounded at Berlin, in 1818, in
defence of the royal party against the democratic
revolutionaries.  In his view, the State exists only to
secure safety of persons and property.  It is a strange
error, he says, to attribute to the State any moral
function.  It is to be regarded merely as the
night-watchman, who protects us from thieves and robbers.
</p>

<p>
The German Parliament, which sat at Frankfurt, had
but a short-lived existence.  In the reaction which
followed, Schopenhauer's philosophy found an open
door.  Disciples attached themselves gradually to the
philosopher, and by degrees his system gained ground
at home and abroad.
</p>

<p>
The work which won for him more popularity than
any other, was <i>Parerga and Paralipomena</i> (Chips and
Scraps), published in 1851.  The work had been
declined by three publishers before a Berlin firm agreed
to publish, without any payment to the author.  The
book consists of essays of a very heterogeneous kind,
and of varying length.  Most of the chief problems
discussed in his larger works are treated again in the
essays.  Religion, education, archæology, Sanscrit,
style, noise, ghosts, and immortality are a few of the
subjects dealt with.  Schopenhauer's reading was wide.
His quotations range freely over oriental, classical, and
modern literature.
</p>

<p>
The success which followed the publication of this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
book was reflected on the earlier works, and it was now
possible to bring out further editions.  Schopenhauer's
delight at this tardy recognition was unbounded.
Every scrap of applause was gathered and absorbed
with eagerness.  In his letters during this period,
everyone who differs from him is denounced as a
charlatan and a windbag.  Everyone who says anything
at all similar is attacked as a plagiarist.  Every
adversary is moved by the meanest motives.  So virulent
is his abuse, and so coarse his language, that words in
his letters have sometimes to be changed for an initial.
Nothing short of adulation, could satisfy his hungry
vanity.  Even when the universities at last acknowledged
him, and offered a prize for the best exposition
and criticism of his system, he was enraged at the
award of the prize to a student who treated him as of
more importance in a literary than in a philosophical
capacity.  Praise of any other philosophy than his own
filled him with bitterness.  His correspondence with
Frauenstadt, Lindner, and Asher is full of such
weakness.  It may be doubted whether any great man ever
left behind him letters of so trifling a nature, so steeped
in vanity and so resentful of any breath of criticism.
</p>

<p>
He was active to the end of his life, though the first
fine rapture of his passionate love for all that is best
in art was dimmed inevitably with the passing years.
There is a pathetic reference in a letter to this dulling
of his power of vision.  "In the time," he writes,
"when my spirit was at its zenith, whatever object my
eye rested upon made revelations to me.  Now that I
am old, it may happen that I stand in front of Raphael's
Madonna, and she says nothing to me."
</p>

<p>
He died suddenly, in 1860, at the age of seventy-two.
The stone which marks his grave bears as inscription
the sole words "Arthur Schopenhauer."

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
PESSIMISM
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer's system is set forth in all its fulness in
his great work, <i>The World as Will and Idea</i>.  All that
he wrote after the appearance of this book was
confirmation and expansion of the theories already laid
down.  It differs from his earlier books in method.
He no longer follows academic lines.  He looks upon
the work as a revelation of the meaning of life, based
on a clear and direct intuition into life, and the style
shapes itself accordingly.  Metaphor frequently takes
the place of argument, and his theories are developed in
a flow of passionate eloquence, contrasting remarkably
with the severer methods of the ordinary metaphysician.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer takes as his starting-point certain theories
from the philosophies of Plato and Kant.  Things, as
we know them in experience, said Kant, are made up
partly of forms or moulds, which are in the mind, and
partly of something outside the mind.  That which we
know, our actual experience, is a combination of the two
elements, the subjective and the objective element.
That part of experience which lies outside the mind,
the reality, the thing-in-itself or the noumenon in
philosophical language, we can never know.  For in order
to be known by us, it has to run into the forms or moulds
supplied by the mind, and in this transition its nature
has been changed.  To know it as it is, before it enters
into contact with our minds, is impossible.  That we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
appear to have objective knowledge is therefore a
deception and an illusion.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer accepts Kant's analysis of experience,
but denies that the thing-in-itself is unknowable.  For
that which is real in our experience is not outside us
altogether, as in Kant's theory.  It lies within
ourselves; it is the only real and essential part of our
nature, and we have a direct knowledge of it.  This
reality Schopenhauer finds in the will.  Now the will
is fully known to us through internal perception, through
intuition.  It is the real, inner nature of everything in
the world.  It affords the key to the knowledge of the
inmost being of the whole of nature.  It is the kernel of
every individual thing, and also of the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note, that Schopenhauer's use of
the word "will" is far wider than that of common
usage.  It includes not only conscious desire, but also
unconscious instinct, and the forces of inorganic nature.
He recognises will not only in the existences which
resemble our own, in men and animals, but also in the
force which germinates and vegetates in the plant, the
force through which the crystal is formed, that by
which the magnet turns to the north pole, the force
which appears in the elective affinities of matter as
repulsion and attraction, decomposition and combination,
and lastly even as gravitation, which draws the
stone to the earth and the earth to the sun.  All these
in their inner nature are identical.  It is the same force
in every manifestation of nature, as in each preconsidered
action of man.  The difference is merely one of
degree.
</p>

<p>
The body is the most real thing for everyone.  If we
analyse the reality of this body, we find nothing but the
will.  With this its reality is exhausted.  The word
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
will, like a magic spell, he says, reveals the inmost being
of all nature.  Spinoza says, that if a stone, which has
been projected through the air, had consciousness, it
would believe that it was moving of its own will.
Schopenhauer adds that the stone would be right.  The
impulse given it, is for the stone what the motive is for
us.  All blindly impelling force, all forces which act in
nature in accordance with universal laws, are equally
in their inner nature to be recognised as will.  It is
everywhere one and the same, "just as the first dim
light of dawn must share the name of sunlight with the
rays of the full midday."
</p>

<p>
Now the will expresses itself necessarily as a struggle.
Everywhere in nature we see strife, conflict, and
alternation of victory.  Every grade of will fights for the
matter, the space, and the time of the others.  For each
desires to express its own inmost nature.  Nature
exists only through such struggle.  This universal
conflict is most distinctly visible in the animal kingdom.
For animals have the whole of the vegetable kingdom
for their food, and even within the animal kingdom
every beast is the prey and the food of another.  Each
animal can maintain its existence only by the constant
destruction of some other life.
</p>

<p>
This is the "will to live" which everywhere preys
upon itself, until finally the human race regards nature
as a manufactory for its own use.  This strife manifests
itself just as characteristically in the lower grades of
will, <i>e.g.</i> the ivy which encircles the oak until the tree
withers as if choked, the parasite which fastens itself
on the animal and kills it.  Even crude matter has its
existence only in the strife of conflicting forces.
</p>

<p>
Man has need of the beasts for his support, the beasts
in their turn have need of each other as well as plants,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
which in their turn require the ground, water, and
chemical elements and their combinations.  Thus in
nature everything preys on some other form of life.
For the will must live on itself; there exists nothing
beside it, and it is a hungry will.
</p>

<p>
This theory of the will is connected by Schopenhauer
with pessimism.  Eternal becoming, endless flux
characterises the inner nature of the will.  In the human
race this character of the will is most clearly marked.
All our endeavours and desires delude us by presenting
their satisfaction as the final end of will.  But as soon
as we attain our desires, they no longer appear the
same.  They soon grow stale and are forgotten, and
then are thrown aside as useless illusions.  The
enchantment of distance shows us paradises, which vanish
like optical delusions, as soon as we have allowed
ourselves to be mocked by them.  We are fortunate if
there still remains something to wish for and to strive
after, that the game may be kept up of constant transition
from desire to satisfaction, and from satisfaction
to a new desire.
</p>

<p>
Happiness, therefore, always lies in the future, or
else in the past.  The present, Schopenhauer compares
to a small dark cloud, which the wind drives over the
sunny plain.  Before and behind it all is bright, but
the cloud itself always casts a shadow.  The present
is always insufficient, the future is uncertain, and the
past irrevocable.
</p>

<p>
The will strives always, for striving is its real nature.
No attainment of the goal can put an end to this
constant striving.  It is not susceptible, therefore, of any
final satisfaction, for in itself it goes on for ever.  As in
the life of the plant, so in the life of all men.  There
is the same restless, unsatisfied striving, a ceaseless
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
movement through ever-ascending forms, until finally
the seed becomes a new starting-point.  This is repeated
<i>ad infinitum</i>, nowhere an end, nowhere a final satisfaction,
nowhere a resting-place.  No possible satisfaction
in the world can suffice to still the cravings of the will,
to set a goal to its infinite aspirations, and to fill the
bottomless abyss of its heart.
</p>

<p>
The hindrance of this striving, through an obstacle,
we call suffering; the attainment of its temporary end
is well-being or happiness.  But as there is no final end
of striving, there is no measure and end of suffering.
In proportion as knowledge attains to distinctness, as
consciousness ascends in the scale of organic life, pain
increases also.  It reaches its highest capacity,
therefore, in man.  The more intelligence a man has, the
greater his capacity for suffering; the man who is
gifted with genius suffers most of all.  Suffering is in
the very nature of all life, and the ceaseless efforts
which we make to banish it succeed only in making
it change its form.  Yet we pursue our lives, absorbed
in the interests of the moment, just as we blow out a
soap bubble as large as possible, although we know
perfectly well that it will burst.  Willing or striving
may be compared to an unquenchable thirst.  Every
act of willing presupposes a want.  The basis of all
willing is need or deficiency.  The nature of man,
therefore, is subject to pain originally and through its very
nature.
</p>

<p>
If, on the other hand, man lacks objects of desire,
being deprived of them by too easy satisfaction, then a
terrible emptiness and sense of boredom, comes over
him.  His very existence becomes an unbearable burden
to him.  Thus life swings like a pendulum backwards
and forwards between pain and boredom.  Men have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
expressed this truth oddly, says Schopenhauer, in
transferring all pain and torments to hell, and in leaving
what remains, that is, boredom, for heaven.  Man is of
all animals the most full of wants and needs.  He is a
concretion of a thousand necessities.  Driven by these,
he wanders through life, uncertain about everything
except his own need and misery.  The care for the
maintenance of his existence occupies, as a rule, the
whole of human life.  A second claim, that of the
reproduction of the species, is related directly to this.
At the same time, he is threatened from all sides by
different kinds of dangers, from which it requires
constant watchfulness to escape.  "With cautious steps
and casting anxious glances round him, he pursues his
path, for a thousand accidents and a thousand enemies
lie in wait for him.  Thus he went while yet a savage,
thus he goes in civilised life.  There is no security for
him."
</p>

<p>
The majority of men wage a constant battle for their
very existence, with nothing before them but the
certainty of losing it at last.  Man's greatest care in
avoiding the rocks and whirlpools of life, only bring him
nearer at every step to the greatest, inevitable, and
irremediable shipwreck of death.  This is the final goal
of the laborious voyage.
</p>

<p>
Whatever nature and fortune may have done, whoever
a man be, and whatever he may possess, the pain
of life cannot be cast off.  Excessive joy and excessive
suffering always occur in the same person, for they
condition each other reciprocally, and are conditioned
by great activity of the mind.  Error and delusion lie
at the foundation of keen joy or grief.  Joy rests on the
delusion that lasting satisfaction has been found for
the desires.  The inevitable result is that when the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
delusion vanishes, we pay for it with pain as bitter as
the joy was keen.  The greater the height from which
we drop, the more severe the fall.
</p>

<p>
For the most part we close our minds to the
knowledge that happiness is a delusion.  We strive
unweariedly from wish to wish, and from desire to desire.
It is incredible how meaningless when viewed from
without, how dull and unenlightened by intellect when
felt from within, is the course of life of the great mass
of men.  It is a weary longing and complaining, a
dreamlike staggering through the four ages of life to
death, accompanied only by trivial thoughts.  Such
men go like clockwork, without knowing the reason
why.  The life of every individual, if we survey it as
a whole, is always a tragedy, but looked at in detail, it
has all the character of a comedy.  Everyone who has
awakened from the first dream of youth, who has
reflected on his own experience and on that of others,
must conclude inevitably that this human world is
the kingdom of chance and error, which rule without
mercy in great things and in small.  Everything better
struggles through only with difficulty.  That which is
noble and wise seldom attains to expression.  The
absurd and the perverse in the sphere of thought, the
dull and tasteless in the sphere of art, the wicked and
deceitful in the sphere of action, assert a supremacy
which is rarely disturbed.
</p>

<p>
Nothing external has power to deliver man from this
dominion of woe.  In vain does he make to himself
gods, in order to get from them by prayers and flattery
what can be accomplished only by his own will-power.
</p>

<p>
The most beautiful part of life, its purest joy, is pure
knowledge.  It is removed from all willing, and lifts
us out of real existence.  This relief, however, is granted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
only to a few, because it demands rare talents and rare
opportunities.  Even the few, to whom it comes only
as a passing dream, are made susceptible of far greater
suffering than duller minds can ever feel.  They are
placed in lonely isolation by their nature, which is
different from that of others.  To the great mass of
men, purely intellectual pleasures are not accessible.
They are almost incapable of the joys which lie in pure
knowledge.  Their lives are given up to willing.
</p>

<p>
If we could bring clearly to a man's sight the terrible
sufferings and miseries to which his life is exposed, he
would be seized with horror.  The brevity of life may be
the best quality it possesses.
</p>

<p>
All happiness is negative in character, and never
positive.  Only pain and want can be felt positively.
Happiness is merely the absence of pain, for it follows
upon the satisfaction of a wish.  Some want or need is
the condition which precedes every pleasure.  But with
the satisfaction, the wish, and therefore the pleasure,
cease.  The satisfaction can never be more than
deliverance from a pain or want.  We observe that the
days of our life were happy after they have given place
to unhappy ones.  In proportion as pleasures increase,
the capacity for them decreases.  What is customary
is no longer felt as a pleasure.  Achievement is difficult,
but when attained it is nothing but deliverance from
some sorrow or want.  Therefore we value our blessings
and advantages only when we have lost them, for the
deprivation, the need, is the positive factor.
</p>

<p>
Man's real existence is only in the present, and the
present is slipping ever into the past.  There is thus a
constant transition into death.  The future is quite
uncertain, and always short.  Our existence, therefore,
is a constant hurrying of the present, into the dead past,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
a constant dying.  On the physical side, the life of the
body is but an ever-postponed death.  In the end death
must conquer, and he only plays for a little with his
prey before he swallows it up.
</p>

<p>
With such intensity did Schopenhauer feel that
pessimism was the only possible conclusion, that he
maintained that optimism was not only absurd, but
really a wicked way of thought.  For optimism is a
bitter mockery of the unspeakable suffering of humanity.
He revolted against the theory of Leibnitz, who maintained
that this is the best of all possible worlds.  It is,
on the contrary, he declared, the worst of all possible
worlds.  Optimism is at bottom the unmerited self-praise
of the will to live, the real originator of the world,
which views itself complacently in its works.  It is
not only a false, but also a pernicious doctrine.  For it
presents life to us as a desirable condition, and
happiness as its end.  Everyone believes that he has a just
claim to happiness and pleasure, and if these do not fall
to his lot, he believes that he is wronged.  It is far more
correct to regard misery and suffering, crowned by death,
as the end of our life, for it is these which lead to the
denial of the will to live.  It is difficult to conceive how
men can deceive themselves and be persuaded that life
is there to be thankfully enjoyed, and that man exists
in order to be happy.  The constant illusion and
disillusion seem intended to awaken the conviction, that
nothing at all is worth our striving, our efforts, or our
struggles, and that all good things are but empty vanity.
The truth is, he says, we ought to be wretched and we are.
</p>

<p>
The world is a hell, which surpasses that of Dante.
One need look only at man's treatment of his fellow-men.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer points to the children, who are sent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
into factories to work there daily for long hours,
performing day after day the same mechanical task.  This,
he adds, is to purchase dearly the satisfaction of drawing
breath.  Everyone would have declined the "gift" of
life, if he could have seen it and tested it beforehand.
But life has never been chosen freely.  Everyone would
retire from the struggle gladly, but want and boredom
are the whips which keep the top spinning.  Every
individual bears the stamp of a forced condition.
Inwardly weary, he longs for rest, but yet he must press
forward.  All movement is forced, and men are pushed
from behind.  It is not life that tempts them on, but
necessity that drives them forward.
</p>

<p>
Suicide is no solution of the problem of life.  It is
not to be regarded as a crime, as in the code of modern
society.  But there is a valid moral reason against it,
in that it substitutes for the real emancipation from the
world of suffering, a merely apparent one.  So far from
being a denial of the will, suicide is indeed a strong
assertion of the will.  The suicide destroys merely the
individual manifestation of life.  The wilful destruction
of the single existence is a vain and foolish act.  The
suicide gives up living, because he cannot give up willing.
He denies the individual only, not the species.  There
is a more adequate way of conquering life than by
destroying it, which Schopenhauer expounds when he
deals with the ethical aspect of his philosophy.
</p>

<p>
His analysis of the worth of human life, as represented
in this theory of pessimism, is the most passionate
and terrible indictment of existence which has ever
found expression.  His sense of disenchantment is felt
with such intensity, that it colours and distorts the
whole fabric of his vision of life.
</p>

<p>
There is much affinity between the character and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
work of Schopenhauer and that of Leopardi.  In both
are displayed penetrating profundity of thought,
extraordinary beauty of expression, and deep insight into
the workings of the human mind, while the same
passionate revolt against the misery of life colours the
outlook and achievement of philosopher and poet alike.
Schopenhauer was acquainted with the writings of
Leopardi, and had great admiration for his work.  His
subject, he says, is always the mockery and wretchedness
of existence, and he presents it with such wealth
of imagery, such multiplicity of forms and applications,
that he never wearies us, but is always entertaining and
exciting.  This estimate of the work of Leopardi might
with equal justice be applied to Schopenhauer himself.
</p>

<p>
As his philosophy gained ground gradually, and
became known, he won many disciples and enthusiastic
followers, and for a time his theories of pessimism
became fashionable.  Certain literary groups adopted
them with enthusiasm, but in that direction his influence
was not permanent.  It is not in Schopenhauer's theory
of pessimism that his true importance and real significance
lie.  In philosophy this influence has but faintly shown
itself.  Schopenhauer's direct successor on these lines of
thought is Eduard von Hartmann.  He rejects Schopenhauer's
doctrine that all pleasure is merely relief from
pain, but admits that the greater number of pleasures
are of this kind.  Satisfaction, he asserts, is always brief,
while dissatisfaction is enduring as life itself.  The pain
in the universe greatly preponderates over the pleasure,
even for those who are regarded as the fortunate ones
in the eyes of the world.  The future, moreover, seems
likely to bring us only increased misery.  Hartmann's
practical conclusion is that we should aim at the negation
of the will to live, not each for himself, as Schopenhauer
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
taught, but universally, by working towards the
annihilation of all existence.  Schopenhauer's influence
is here, obviously, very strongly marked.
</p>

<p>
Another disciple, and a far more famous one, is
Nietzsche.  He came under Schopenhauer's influence
while a student at the university, and threw himself
with passionate enthusiasm under the spell of his
philosophy.  Although in his later development he
reacted strongly in an opposite direction, yet all his work
bears the mark of the deep impress which Schopenhauer
had made upon his mind.  His outlook on life
had been changed profoundly by "that wonderful
heart-stirring philosophy," as he calls it.  One of his
earliest works was an essay on <i>Schopenhauer as Educator</i>,
in which he bases the greatness of Schopenhauer
on his power to see the picture of life as a unity, and to
express it as such.  He is held up as the ideal
philosopher, and as one of three models for future man, the
other two being Goethe and Rousseau.  Schopenhauer's
insistence on action as the proper sphere of man, as
contrasted with the mere life of thought, made a strong
appeal to Nietzsche.  A philosopher, says Nietzsche,
must be not only a great thinker, but a living man.
Schopenhauer had not been spoilt, as was Kant, by his
education.  He had seen life as well as studied books,
and so was able to see how the free, strong man could
be evolved.  Many of Nietzsche's most characteristic
doctrines are suggested in this early essay, and are read
partially into Schopenhauer's philosophy.
</p>

<p>
It is more especially Schopenhauer's theories of art
which influenced Nietzsche's thought, and left the
deepest and most permanent mark on his work.  He
adopted in his early days the pessimism along with the
rest of Schopenhauer's system.  But this conception
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
of life was not really native to his mind, and it was
against this aspect of Schopenhauer's philosophy that
he reacted most violently in later life.  Nietzsche
stands, above all else, for the affirmation of life,
Schopenhauer for the negation of life.  In his protest against
pessimism, Nietzsche reaffirms with passionate intensity
the worth of life and the splendour of human
destiny.  He told men to believe in the glory of things,
and bade them shout for the joy of living.  "All that's
joyful shall be true," he says in one of his poems.  In
another passage he insists that "it is necessary to
remain bravely at the surface, to worship appearance, to
believe in forms, in tones, in words, in the whole
Olympus of appearance."  It is clear that by this time
nothing of the pessimistic outlook on life had been left
in Nietzsche's philosophy.
</p>

<p>
Pessimism will always find an echo in the minds of
those who by temperament tend to see only the darker
colours of the picture of life.  Too much questioning
and too little responsibility lead down to the abyss,
as William James points out.  Pessimism, he says, is
essentially a religious disease.  It consists in nothing
but a religious demand, to which there comes no normal
religious reply.
</p>

<p>
To the great mass of mankind there is something alien
and repellent in this grim and bitter outlook of
hopelessness.  It finds little or no response in the heart of
the normal human being, even though at times the
nightmare view may force itself upon him.  "Deliverance,"
says the Indian poet Tagore, "is not for me in
renunciation.  I feel the embrace of freedom in a
thousand bonds of delight.  All my illusions will burn
into illumination of joy and all my desires ripen into
fruits of love."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
</p>

<p>
For Schopenhauer the way of escape lay in two
directions.  In considering his æsthetic theories, we
shall see how he found in art a temporary release from
the bondage of life, and in his ethical system he points
the way to a permanent deliverance.
</p>

<p>
It is in these statements, the æsthetic and the ethical
aspects of his system, that we find the most significant
part of Schopenhauer's philosophy.  His pessimism
left little permanent mark on the course of philosophic
thought.  It is to the other side of his work that we
must look for a fruitful issue, to his statement of the
function of art and its meaning for life; his insistence
on the will, the active element, as that which has most
reality and significance in life; to the part which the
feelings, instinct, and impulse play in his system.  In
all these directions, Schopenhauer's influence has been
powerful and far-reaching.  To-day he is a stronger
force than any other of the great thinkers of his time,
overshadowed though he was by them during his lifetime.
In Germany especially, his influence is felt as a
powerful factor in the thought of the present day.

CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
ART
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer's theory of the beautiful is the side of
his philosophy which has always made so potent an
appeal to artists, and to all those lovers of the beautiful,
for whom art represents the supreme significance of life.
</p>

<p>
The present for Schopenhauer is only an infinitesimal
moment between two eternities, the past and the future.
It is "a flash of light between two darknesses."  Now
how is man to make the best of this brief moment,
under the hard conditions of his destiny?  The answer
to this question Schopenhauer finds in his theory of the
function of art.  He links up into intimate relation his
theory of æsthetic with his philosophical pessimism,
but his pessimism is modified considerably in the process.
</p>

<p>
There are certain men, he maintains, who can free
themselves from the bondage of the will.  They can
throw off its yoke, and, released from all the aims of
desire, they can become disinterested spectators of the
real, essential nature of the world.  The inner meaning
of their clear, deep vision they can interpret to others.
Such men are artists, and the interpretation of their
vision is the work of art.  In art are revealed the
eternal truths of the nature of man and the universe,
revealed with a power and directness to which science
can never attain.  Artists, then, are the seers, the
visionaries, who penetrate into the hidden, vital
principles of things.  They alone have power to interpret
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
the half-uttered speech of nature, and disentangle that
which is real and essential, the inner truth, from that
which is accidental and transitory.  The road to
philosophy, then, leads through the gateway of art.
</p>

<p>
In this theory Schopenhauer starts from Plato's
doctrine of the Ideas.  The particular objects of sense,
which we know, are mere appearances.  They have no
reality in themselves.  They arise and pass away, they
always become and never are.  But there exist also
the types and eternal forms of things, which do not
enter into time and space, and which remain fixed,
subject to no change.  These constitute the sole reality.
Plato called them the Ideas, and Schopenhauer adopts
this term from the Platonic philosophy.  The Ideas for
Schopenhauer represent the different grades of the
objectification of the will, which are manifested in the
individuals.  These are the eternal forms or prototypes
of individual things.
</p>

<p>
Our knowledge of the ordinary things of sense-experience
is indirect, it is gained by way of the intellect.
Our knowledge of the Ideas, on the other
hand, is direct and immediate, it is gained through
intuition.  In his account of the Ideas, or the real,
essential nature of things, Schopenhauer is treading
already the path of mysticism, along which he works
out his theories of ethics.
</p>

<p>
Now the whole function of art is to reproduce the
eternal ideas, to seize on that which is essential and
abiding in all the phenomena of the world.  The one
and only source of art is the knowledge of true reality,
of the Ideas.  The one aim of art is the communication
of this knowledge.  According to the material in which
this vision of true reality is reproduced, it is architecture,
sculpture, painting, poetry, or music.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
</p>

<p>
Science can only follow the unresting and inconstant
stream of appearances.  It can never reach a final goal
nor attain complete satisfaction, any more than by
running we can reach the place where the clouds touch
the horizon.  But art, on the other hand, is everywhere
at its goal.  It plucks the object of its contemplation
out of the stream of things as they seem, and holds it
isolated before its vision.  And this particular thing,
which in the stream of the world's course was a small
perishing part, becomes to art the representative of
the whole, the type of the endless multitude in space
and time.  Art, therefore, pauses before this reality,
which it perceives in the particular thing.  The course
of time stands still; relations vanish before it; only
the essential, the Idea, remains as the object of the
artist's vision.  In the multitudinous and manifold
forms of human life, and in the unceasing change of
events, the artist looks only on the Idea, knowing it as
the abiding and the essential, as that which is known
with equal truth for all time.  Art, therefore, is the
bridge between two worlds.  It leads us from things
as they seem to things as they really are.
</p>

<p>
It is the genius who possesses this power of vision,
and whose magic works can unfold before the eyes of
ordinary mortals the spirit of beauty as she has revealed
herself to him.  Entirely in this spirit does Blake express
his sense of the poet's mission:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I rest not from my great task<br />
  To open the eternal worlds, to open the immortal eyes<br />
  Of man inwards; into the worlds of thought; into Eternity<br />
  Ever expanding in the bosom of God, the human Imagination.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The method of genius is always artistic, as opposed
to scientific.  The nature of genius consists in a
surpassing capacity for the pure contemplation of Ideas.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
It is the faculty of continuing in the state of pure
perception, of losing the personality in perception, and of
enlisting in this service the knowledge which existed
originally only for the service of the will.  Genius, then,
is the power of leaving one's own interests, wishes, and
aims entirely out of sight, of renouncing entirely one's
own personality for a time, so as to remain pure knowing
subject, clear vision of the world.  This state must be
achieved, not merely at moments, but for a sufficient
length of time, and with sufficient consciousness, to
enable the artist to reproduce by deliberate art what
has thus been seized by his inner vision.  He must fix
in lasting thoughts the wavering images that float
before the mind:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But from these create he can<br />
  Forms more real than living man,<br />
  Nurslings of immortality."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is as if, says Schopenhauer, when genius appears
in an individual, a far greater measure of the power of
knowledge falls to his lot than is necessary for ordinary
men.  This excess of knowledge, being free, now
becomes subject purified from will, a clear mirror of the
inner nature of the world.
</p>

<p>
Imagination is an essential element in genius, and it
is a necessary condition that it should be possessed
in an extraordinary degree.  Imagination extends the
horizon far beyond the limits of actual personal experience,
and so enables the artist to construct the whole
dream, the complete vision, out of the little that comes
into his own actual apperception.
</p>

<p>
The actual objects are almost always but imperfect
copies of the ideas expressed in them.  Therefore the
artist requires imagination in order to see in things, not
that which nature has actually made, but that which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
she endeavoured to make, but could not, because of
the never-ceasing conflict between the various forms of
will.  Through the penetrating vision of this imagination,
the artist recognises the Idea.  He understands
the half-uttered speech of nature, and is able to articulate
clearly what she only stammered forth.
</p>

<p>
The common mortal, he says, that manufacture of
nature, which she produces by the thousand every day,
is not capable of observation that is wholly
disinterested in every sense.  He can turn his attention to
things only so far as they have some relation to his will,
however indirect it may be.  This is why he is so soon
done with everything, with works of art, objects of
natural beauty, and everywhere with all that is truly
significant in the various scenes of life.  He does not
linger in the pursuit of beauty, but seeks only to gain
his own way in life.  On the consideration of the
significance of life as a whole, he wastes no time.  The artist,
on the other hand, strives to understand the inner nature
of everything.  His faculty of vision is to him the sum
which reveals the world.
</p>

<p>
In spite of his contempt for the majority of men,
Schopenhauer has to admit that the faculty of perceiving
the Idea, the inner reality, must exist in nearly all
men, in a smaller and different degree, otherwise they
would be just as incapable of enjoying works of art as
of producing them.  They would have no susceptibility
to beauty, nor to sublimity.  All men, therefore, who
are capable of æsthetic pleasure at all, must be capable
to some extent of knowing the Idea in things, and in
responding to the call of beauty, of transcending their
personality for the moment.
</p>

<p>
Æsthetic pleasure is the same whether it is evoked
by a work of art or by the contemplation of nature, for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
the Idea remains unchanged and the same.  The work
of art is only a means of making permanent the vision
in which this pleasure consists.  The artist does not
add "the gleam, the light that never was on sea or
land," but his vision is more finely attuned to the
reality than that of ordinary men.  He makes
permanent in the various media of art "the consecration
and the poet's dream."  His work acts as a communicating
spark from mind to mind.
</p>

<p>
In one of Carlyle's most suggestive passages, he
insists on the spiritual and symbolic nature of the work
of art, in words that echo curiously the thought of
Schopenhauer.  "In all true works of art," he says,
"thou wilt discern eternity looking through time, the
godlike rendered visible ... a hierarch therefore, and
pontiff of the world will we call him, the poet and
inspired maker, who Prometheus-like can shape new
symbols, and bring new fire from heaven to fix it there."
</p>

<p>
That the Idea, the true reality behind appearance, is
revealed with so much more force and clearness in the
productions of art than directly in nature is due to the
power of the artist to abstract the pure Idea, the reality,
from the actual and the accidental, omitting all
disturbing, non-essential qualities.  He disentangles that
which is real and essential from the confused mass
presented in experience.  The artist lets us see the real
world through his eyes.  That he has these eyes, that
he knows the inner nature of things, apart from all their
relations, is the gift of genius.  This gift is inborn,
and cannot be acquired.  But that the artist is able to
lend us this gift, and let us see through his eyes, is
acquired.  This is the technical side of his art.
</p>

<p>
Primarily, then, the genius is the artist.  Scientific
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
genius finds no place in Schopenhauer's scheme.  Statesmen
are of very different fibre.  Their intellect retains a
practical tendency, and is concerned with the choice
of the best means to practical ends, remaining therefore
in the service of the will.  The eminent man, who
is fitted for great achievement in the practical sphere of
life, is so because objects rouse his will in a strong
degree, and spur him on to the investigation of their
relations.  His intellect, therefore, has grown up in close
connection with his will.
</p>

<p>
Talent is limited to detecting the relations which
exist between individual phenomena, whereas genius
rises to a vision of the universal in the individual.  The
genius has a vision of another and a deeper world,
because he sees more profoundly into the world which
lies before him.  "To compare useful people with men
of genius is like comparing building stone with
diamonds."  Mere men of talent come always at the right
time, for they are called forth by the needs of their own
age.  The genius, on the other hand, comes into his age
like a comet, whose eccentric course is foreign to its
well-regulated order.  Genius appears only as a
perfectly isolated exception.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer never states definitely that a philosopher
may be a genius, but he always seems to assume
that he himself belongs to the heavenly company.  He
gives a detailed description of the genius, even to his
physical appearance.  With his usual habit of generalising
from his own particular case, he endows the genius
with many of his own personal characteristics, even to
his dislike of mathematics.
</p>

<p>
The Platonic theory of Ideas was the basis on which
Schopenhauer built his philosophy of art.  But Plato's
own theory of the function of art differed fundamentally
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
from that of Schopenhauer, and it is interesting
to compare the two views.  To Plato it seemed that art
was concerned with the imitation of things as they
seem, not as they really are; with the objects of sense
perception and not with the Ideas.  The artist
mutates the illusory appearances of concrete things.
Consequently the work of art is still further removed from
true reality, from the Idea, than is the thing of
experience.  It is a copy of a copy.  This led him to the
statement that works of art are thrice removed from
the truth.  They can be produced easily without any
knowledge of the truth, for they are concerned only
with appearances, and not with the reality that lies
behind appearances.  Hence Plato's rejection of art.
In his system it is not art, but philosophy that gives
a direct revelation of truth.  Schopenhauer, on the other
hand, maintains that it is not the concrete object of
experience, but the reality itself which lies behind that
object, with which the artist is supremely concerned.
The artist alone among men has the capacity of vision
to see and grasp the truth of this reality.  Such capacity
of vision is reserved by Plato for philosophers, those
whom he calls "lovers of the vision of truth."
</p>

<p>
In his earlier works, Plato approximates far more
closely to Schopenhauer's theory.  He speaks there of
the poet as "a light and winged and holy thing.  There
is no invention in him until he has been inspired....
Beautiful poems are not human or the work of man,
but divine and the work of God.  The poets are only
the interpreters of the gods, by whom they are
severally possessed."
</p>

<p>
The value of art for Schopenhauer lies mainly in its
power to deliver us from the slavery of the will.  In the
quiet contemplation of beauty revealed in art, we are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
delivered from the misery of life.  Willing, he
maintains, arises from want, and therefore from suffering.
The satisfaction of a wish ends it, but every satisfied
wish at once makes room for a new one, and both are
illusions.  No attained object of desire can give lasting
satisfaction, but merely a fleeting gratification.  It is like
the alms thrown to the beggar, that keeps him alive
today, that his misery may be prolonged till the morrow.
</p>

<p>
Without peace no true well-being is possible.  But
when some external cause or inward disposition lifts
us suddenly out of the endless stream of willing, and
knowledge is delivered from the slavery of the will, we
have a vision of things free from this relation of the
will.  We can observe them without personal interest,
without subjectivity.  Then, all at once, the peace
which we are always seeking, but which always fled
from us on the path of the desires, comes to us of its own
accord, and it is well with us.  This is the painless state,
which Epicurus prized as the highest good, and as the
state of the gods.  We are then set free from the miserable
striving of the will.  It is this deliverance that art
effects for us, and which is accomplished only by the
inner power of the artistic nature.  Art frees us from
all subjectivity, from the bondage of the will.  This
freeing of knowledge lifts us out of all the misery of
endless desire, as wholly and entirely as do sleep and
dreams.  Happiness and unhappiness have disappeared.
We are no longer individuals.  We are only that one eye
of the world, which looks out from all knowing
creatures, but which can become perfectly free from the
service of the will in man alone.  Art provides us with
a sphere, in which we can escape from all our misery,
and can attain to a state of temporary peace and
painlessness.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
</p>

<p>
There is a curious affinity between the æsthetic
theories of one of the mediæval mystics and those of
Schopenhauer.  St. Thomas Aquinas, the greatest of
the schoolmen, expounded views in the thirteenth
century akin in many respects to those set forth by
Schopenhauer at the beginning of the nineteenth century.
Beauty, he held, is the revelation of reason in sensuous
shape, and he proceeds further to say that in the
realisation of beauty desire is quieted.
</p>

<p>
Art is the most joy-giving and the only innocent side
of life.  It is, says Schopenhauer, in the full significance
of the word, the flower of life.  The pleasure which
we receive from all beauty, the consolation which art
affords, enables us to forget the cares of life.  This
pleasure consists in the contemplation of the Ideas, in the
contemplation of the inner truth of life, which reveals
to us a drama full of significance.  In entering into the
state of pure contemplation, our happiness lies in the
sense of being lifted, for the time being, above all willing,
beyond all wishes and desires.  We become freed from
ourselves.  These moments when, sunk in contemplation
and enjoyment of the work of art, we are delivered
from the ardent striving of the will, when we seem to rise
out of the heavy atmosphere of earth, these moments
are the happiest which we ever know.
</p>

<p>
The arts themselves Schopenhauer arranges according
to their subject-matter rather than according to their
medium.  He places them in very much the same order
as that in which Hegel puts them.  Architecture,
painting and sculpture, poetry and music are each
discussed in turn.
</p>

<p>
<i>Music</i>.&mdash;Music is the apex of his whole system of
æsthetics.  It is placed by itself, outside and above all
the other arts.  For it is not, like the other arts, a copy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
of the Ideas, but it is the copy of the will itself.  In the
main Schopenhauer's treatment of music is mystical.
Hegel too gave to music the supreme position among
the arts.  It was the central romantic art in his system,
and the mysterious magical enchantment of music is
painted by him with glowing eloquence.
</p>

<p>
The effect of music, says Schopenhauer, on the inmost
nature of man, is powerful beyond that of any of the
other arts.  For that great and exceedingly noble art
stands alone, quite apart from the other arts.  In it
there is no copy or repetition of any Idea of existence
in the world.  It is understood by man in his inmost
consciousness as a universal language, the distinctness
of which surpasses that of the visible world itself.  The
basis of modern music lies in the numerical relations
which underlie sounds.  Arithmetical proportions enter
into and have some part in the pleasure which we derive
from music, as Leibnitz points out, but this does not
account for that passionate delight with which we hear
the deepest recesses of our nature find expression in
sound.  If we take the æsthetic effect as a criterion,
we must attribute to music a far deeper and more vital
significance than that which lies at the basis of the other
arts.  This is connected with the inmost nature of
man and the world.  Its representative relation to the
world must be very deep, absolutely true, and
extraordinarily accurate, because it is understood immediately
by everyone.  It has the appearance of a certain
infallibility, because its form may be reduced to quite
definite rules, expressed in numbers, from which it
cannot free itself without ceasing to be music.  The
obscure relation of music to the world has never been
made clear.
</p>

<p>
In order to explain this relation, Schopenhauer says
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
he gave his mind entirely to the impression of music
in all its aspects, and then returned to apply his
reflections to his system of thought.  We know that he
had invaluable opportunities of studying music, in its
various forms, during the time that he was working
out his system at Dresden.  He himself practised daily
the use of a musical instrument.  The result of his
investigation is an explanation, which he admits is
impossible of proof, because it regards music as the copy
of an original, which can never itself be presented
directly as idea.  But he maintains that in order to
assent with full conviction to his theory of the significance
of this art, it is only necessary to listen frequently
to music, testing the theory at the time, and reflecting
constantly upon it.
</p>

<p>
The other arts represent the Ideas in the particular
things, the realities that lie behind the visible world,
but music is independent altogether of the world of
concrete things.  It ignores completely this aspect of
life.  It could to a certain extent exist even if there was
no world at all.  Music, then, is not the copy of the Ideas,
but the copy of the Will itself.  That is why the effect
of music is so much more powerful and penetrating
than that of the other arts, for they speak only of
shadows, but it speaks of the thing itself.
</p>

<p>
Browning relates music to the will in one of his
best-known poems, when he makes Abt Vogler say:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,<br />
  Existent behind all laws, that made them, and lo, they are!<br />
  And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,<br />
  That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Schopenhauer, in working out the details of his
theory, tries to establish an analogy between music and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
the Ideas of the visible world, connecting the lower
tones with the lowest grades of the objectification of the
will, those of inorganic nature, and leading up gradually
through the intermediate grades until the higher tones
are reached, representing the other end of the scale,
the highest organic forms of life.  The melody, the high
singing part, represents the intelligent life and effort of
man, and progresses with unrestrained freedom, while
it dominates the whole.  This represents the unbroken,
significant connection of one continuous thought.  The
melody, therefore, has significant intentional connection
from beginning to end.  It records the history of
the will enlightened by intellect.  In the world of
experience the will expresses itself in action.  But melody
does more, it expresses the inner side of the action,
drawing out from the deeps its secret history, its motives
and efforts, its passionate yearning and inner excitements,
all that which the reason includes in the concept
of feeling.  For this reason music has been called the
language of feeling and passion, as words are the
language of the reason.  In melody there is a constant
deviation from the keynote in a thousand ways, yet
there always follows a constant return to the keynote.
In all these digressions and deviations melody expresses
the manifold efforts of the will.  Its satisfaction is also
expressed by the final return to a harmonious interval,
and to the keynote.  In melody, therefore, the composer
reveals all the deepest secrets of human willing
and feeling.
</p>

<p>
His work lies far from all reflection and conscious
intention, and flows directly from inspiration.  The
abstract conception is here, as everywhere in art,
unfruitful.  The composer reveals the inner nature of the
world, and expresses the deepest wisdom in a language
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
which his reason does not understand.  In the same
way, a person under the influence of mesmerism tells
things of which he has no conception when he wakes.
In the composer, more than in any other artist, the man
is entirely separate and distinct from the artist.
</p>

<p>
As quick transition from wish to satisfaction is
well-being, so quick melodies are cheerful.  Slow melodies
are analogous to the delayed and hardly-won satisfaction,
and are sad.  Quick dance music seems to speak
only of easily attained and common pleasure.  Adagio
movements speak of the pain of a great and noble
striving, which despises all trivial happiness.
</p>

<p>
The effect of the major and the minor key is equally
marked.  In general, music consists of a constant
succession of more or less disquieting chords, chords
which excite "immortal longings," and also of more or
less quieting and satisfying chords, just as the life of
the heart is a constant succession of feelings of
disquietude and of peace, following desire and satisfaction.
Just as there are two general fundamental moods of the
feelings, serenity and sadness, so music has two keys,
which correspond to these, the major and the minor.
Since music is founded deeply in the nature of man, the
dominant national mood is reproduced invariably in a
country's music.  We find accordingly that the minor
key prevails in Russian music, while allegro in the minor
is characteristic of French music, "as if one danced
while one's shoe pinched."
</p>

<p>
But in all these analogies music has no direct, but
only an indirect relation to them.  It does not express
particular and definite joys, sorrows, pains, or horrors,
but joy, sorrow, pain, or horror itself, the real, inner
nature of each emotion.  It is the essential character of
these emotions that is represented, without disturbing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
accessories.  Music expresses only the quintessence of
life and its events, never the events themselves.  This
inner meaning of life, the eternal truth of things, is
felt and understood immediately when we listen to
great music.  "All things eternal," wrote Wagner,
"can be expressed with unmistakable certainty in
music."  And in another passage, he says, "Music can
never and in no possible alliance cease to be the highest,
the redeeming art.  It is of her nature, that what all
the other arts but hint at, through her and in her
becomes the most indubitable of certainties, the most
direct and definite of truths."
</p>

<p>
It is for this reason that our imagination is excited
so easily by music, and that we seek to give it form by
clothing it with words.  This is the origin of opera and
songs.
</p>

<p>
Wagner built up a whole theory of music, based on
the philosophy of Schopenhauer.  But in their views on
opera they differed fundamentally.  The text of opera,
says Schopenhauer, should never forsake a subordinate
position.  The music should never become a mere
means of expressing the words.  That is a great
misconception of the function of music, for music should
always be universal.  It is just its universality, which
belongs exclusively to it, that gives music its high
worth as "the panacea for all our woes."  If music is
too closely united to the words, and tries to express
itself according to outward events, it is striving to speak
a language which is not its own.  Schopenhauer
mentions Rossini as the composer who is most free from
this mistake.  His music speaks so clearly that it
requires no words to explain it.
</p>

<p>
Nature and music, then, are merely two different
expressions of the same thing.  Music is a universal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
language, expressing the inner nature of the world.  It
resembles geometrical figures and numbers.  They are
the universal forms of all possible objects of experience,
and yet are not abstract, but concrete and determined.
All that goes on in the heart of man, and that is
included in the concept of feeling, may be expressed by an
infinite number of possible melodies, but always
universally.  Music represents the inmost soul of the event,
without the body.  We might therefore just as well
call the world embodied music as embodied will.  For
this reason music makes every scene of real life, and of
the world, more profoundly significant.  It lays bare
the inmost kernel which lies hidden in the heart of all
things.  It penetrates to the very heart of nature.  The
ineffable joy which we derive from music, which haunts
our consciousness as the vision of a distant paradise,
restores to us all the emotions of our inmost nature,
but divested entirely of the sting of actuality, and far
removed from its pain.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to compare the view of Schopenhauer,
that music is a copy of the will itself, with the theory of
Plato and Aristotle, which maintained that music is a
direct reflection of character.  The modern art of music
was not developed in their day, and yet both these
philosophers seem to have had prophetic insight in
understanding the nature of the marvellous spell and
power of sound.  Music to them was an imitation, a
copy of character, and as such of profound importance
in education.  Music reflects character, and therefore
moulds and influences it.  The foundations of
character, says Plato, are laid in music, which charms the
souls of the young into the path of virtue.  Rhythm
and harmony find their way into the secret places of
the soul, making the soul harmonious and graceful.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
"If our youth are to do their work in life, they must
make harmony their perpetual aim," and the soul can
only be reached and educated in this way through
music.
</p>

<p>
It is Schopenhauer's theory of music which has
influenced most directly the world of art.  It was
hailed by Wagner as a revelation, and it determined his
musical development and all his æsthetic theories.
Through Wagner it may be said to have revolutionised
much of modern music.  After reading <i>The World as
Will and Idea</i>, Wagner wrote, "I must confess to having
arrived at a clear understanding of my own works of
art through the help of another, who has provided me
with the reasoned conceptions corresponding to my
intuitive principles."  This philosophy contained, he
said, the intellectual demonstration of the conflict of
human forces, which he himself had demonstrated
artistically.
</p>

<p>
<i>Architecture</i>.&mdash;In Schopenhauer's arrangement of
the arts, music, as we have seen, occupies the supreme
place, being the highest expression in art which man
can achieve.  At the other end of the scale stands
architecture.  Its aim is to bring to greater distinctness
some of the ideas which represent the lowest grades
of the will, such as gravity, cohesion, rigidity, and
hardness.  These are the universal qualities of stone, and
the simplest, most inarticulate manifestations of will.
They may be called the bass notes of nature.  The
conflict between gravity and rigidity is the sole æsthetic
material of architecture.  Its problem is to make this
conflict appear distinctly in a multitude of different
ways.  The beauty of a building lies in the obvious
adaptation of every part to the stability of the whole.
The position, size, and form of every part must be so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
related to the whole, that it forms a necessary and
inevitable part of an organic unity.  Each arch, column,
and capital must be determined by its relation to the
whole building.
</p>

<p>
It is the function of architecture to reveal also the
nature of light.  For the light is intercepted, confined,
and reflected by the mass of the building.  It is thrown
into high relief by the receding forms, which supply the
contrasting depths of shade.  It thus unfolds its nature
and qualities in the clearest and most definite way.  It
is not merely form and symmetry which appeal to us
in architecture, but primarily the fundamental forces
of nature, the simplest qualities of matter.  The quality
of the material, therefore, is of great importance.  The
fundamental law of architecture is that no burden shall
be without sufficient support, and no support without
a suitable burden.  The purest example of this
principle is the column and entablature.  In separating
completely the support and burden in the column and
entablature, the reciprocal action of the two and their
relation to each other become perfectly clear.  For
this reason the simplest building in Italy gives æsthetic
pleasure, due to the flatness of the roof.  A high roof is
neither support nor burden, for its two halves support
each other.  It serves merely a useful end, presenting
to the eye an extended mass, which is wholly alien to the
æsthetic sense.  Architecture requires large masses, in
order to be felt adequately, and it must work out its own
character under the law of the most perfect clearness
to the eye.  It exists in space-perception, and must
make a direct and inevitable appeal to the æsthetic
sense.  This demands symmetry, which is necessary
to mark out the work as a whole.  It is only through
symmetry that a work of architecture reveals itself as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
an organic unity and as the development of a central
thought.  Architecture ought not to imitate the forms
of nature, and yet it should work in the spirit of nature.
It should reveal the end in view quite openly, and
should avoid everything which is merely aimless.  Thus
it achieves the grace which is the result of ease, and the
subordination of every detail to its purpose.
</p>

<p>
It follows from Schopenhauer's treatment of
architecture that he held Greek work of the best period to be
the highest type of building which it is possible to attain.
In its best examples that style is perfect and complete,
and is not susceptible of any important improvement.
The modern architect, he held, cannot depart, to any
great extent, from the rules and models of the Greeks,
without descending the path of deterioration.  There
remains nothing for him to do but to apply the art
transmitted to him, and to carry out the rules laid down,
so far as he is able under the limitations of climate, age,
and country.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer, therefore, had no appreciation of
Gothic architecture.  The simple rationality of the
Greek temple delights him, but the Gothic cathedral
leaves him cold and unmoved.  He makes the naïve
admission, that approval of Gothic architecture would
upset all his theories of the æsthetic significance of
architecture.  To compare the two is, he says, a
barbarous presumption, although he allows, somewhat
grudgingly, that a certain beauty of its own cannot be
denied to the Gothic style.  Our pleasure in it, however,
is to be traced mainly to the association of ideas, and
to historical memories.  That pure rationality by which
every part admits instantly of strict account in its
subordination to the plan as a whole, is not to be found
in Gothic work.  Greek architecture is conceived in a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
purely objective spirit, whereas Gothic is rather
subjective in spirit.  But Schopenhauer cannot reason
away entirely the impression created by the Gothic
interior.  That, he admits, is the finest part of the
whole, and it is here that the mind is impressed by the
effect of the groined vaulting, borne by slender, aspiring
pillars, soaring upwards.  All burden seems to have
disappeared, promising eternal security.  Most of the
faults, however, appear upon the exterior, whereas in
Greek buildings the exterior is the finer; in the interior
the flat roof retains something depressing and prosaic.
</p>

<p>
Of the ideals and aspirations which the great builders
of the Middle Ages so wonderfully transmuted into stone,
Schopenhauer has nothing to tell us.  The men "who
sang their souls in stone" were for him pre-eminently
the builders of Greek temples.
</p>

<p>
In his insistence on the open display of the relation
between burden and support, and also on the importance
of bringing out the qualities of the material, Schopenhauer's
treatment of architecture recalls many passages
in Ruskin, in which he insists repeatedly, that both
truth and feeling require that the conditions of support
should be clearly understood, and that the quality of
the material must find expression.
</p>

<p>
The analogy of architecture to music is one of the
most characteristic and suggestive portions of
Schopenhauer's æsthetic.  He emphasises the great difference
between the two arts, pointing out that according to
their inner nature, in their potency, extent, and
significance they are indeed true antipodes.  Architecture
exists in space, unrelated to time, whereas music is in
time alone, having no relation to space.  But the
principle which gives coherency to architecture is symmetry,
that which gives coherency to music is rhythm.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
close relationship between these two principles is obvious.
It is this resemblance which has led to the saying that
architecture is "frozen music," which Schopenhauer
quotes from Goethe.
</p>

<p>
This relation between the two arts, however, extends
only to the outward form.  In their inner nature they are
entirely different.  In essential qualities, Schopenhauer
maintains, architecture is the most limited and the
weakest of all the arts, whereas music is the most
far-reaching, and possesses the deepest significance.
</p>

<p>
<i>Painting and Sculpture</i>.&mdash;Filling an intermediate
position between architecture and music come painting and
sculpture.  These arts represent more complex grades
of the will than architecture, and therefore convey the
truth of life with deeper insight.  They too are
concerned with the Ideas, and symbolise the inner reality
of outward things and events.  Lowest in the scale of
the various kinds of painting come the painting of
landscape and of still life, in which the subjective side of
æsthetic pleasure is predominant.  Our satisfaction
consists less in the vision and comprehension of the
Ideas than in the state of mind aroused.  We receive
a reflected sense of the deep spiritual peace and absolute
silence of the will, which are necessary in order to enter
so completely into the character of these lifeless objects.
It would be impossible to bring the modern art of
landscape painting, with its revolt against a purely
objective representation of nature, into line with this
analysis of Schopenhauer's.
</p>

<p>
Next in the scale comes the painting and sculpture
of animals, and then follows the plastic representation
of the human form.  The artist expresses in marble
or paint that beauty of form which nature has failed
to complete, and which has to be disentangled from the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
obscuring cloud of trivial and accidental details.  In
virtue of this anticipation through art, it is possible for
us to recognise beauty when nature by a rare chance
does achieve a masterpiece.  Human beauty is the
fullest objectification of the will at the highest grade
which is known.  It is expressed through form.  In
sculpture, beauty and grace are the principal qualities.
The special character of the mind, represented by
expression, is the peculiar sphere of painting.  Historical
painting aims at beauty, grace, and character.  The
inward significance of an action, which is the depth
of insight into the Idea which it reveals, must be
brought to light.  Only the inward significance concerns
art, the outward belongs to history.  The countless
scenes and events which make up the life of men are
important enough to be the object of art, for by their
rich variety they unfold the many-sided Idea of
humanity.
</p>

<p>
No event of human life is excluded from painting.
The painters of the Dutch school, for example, are great
artists, not only in virtue of their technical skill, but
because they have seized the inner significance of the
things and actions they have depicted.  They have real
depth of insight into reality.  What is peculiarly
significant is not the individual, nor the particular event,
but that which is universal in the individual.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer held that the highest achievements of
the art of painting were reached by the Italian painters
of the early Renaissance, especially by Raphael and
Correggio.  We see in them, says Schopenhauer, a
complete grasp of the Ideas, and thus the whole nature
of life and the world.  In them we find the spirit of
complete resignation, which is the inmost spirit of early
Christianity, as well as of Indian philosophy.  There
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
are portrayed the surrender of all volition, the suppression
of the will.  In this way these great artists expressed
the highest wisdom, which is the summit of all art.
</p>

<p>
<i>Poetry</i>.&mdash;Poetry too represents the ideal in individual
creations.  Its aim, like the other arts, is the revelation
of the Ideas.  The poet must understand how to draw
the abstract and universal out of the concrete and
individual, by the manner in which he combines them.
The universality of every concept must be narrowed
more and more, until we reach the concrete image, for
the poet must express the universal in concrete form.
The whole of nature can be represented in the medium
of poetry.  The extent of its province is boundless.
Thoughts and emotions, however, are its peculiar
province, and here no other art can compete with it.
That which has significance in itself, and not in its
relations, the real unfolding of the Idea, is found definitely
and distinctly in poetry.  More genuine inner truth is
to be found in poetry than in history.  The poet's
knowledge is intuitive, and by its means he shows us in
the mirror of his mind the Idea, pure and distinct,
bringing to the consciousness of others that which they
feel and do.  In the epic, the poem of romance, and the
tragedy, selected characters are placed in those
circumstances in which all their special qualities unfold
themselves, and the depths of the human heart are revealed,
and become visible in significant actions.
</p>

<p>
Tragedy is the summit of poetic art.  Here the
unspeakable pain, the wail of humanity, the triumph of
evil, the mastery of chance is unfolded before us.  It is
one and the same will that appears throughout.  Knowledge
reaches the point at which it is no longer deceived
by the veil of Mâyâ, the web of illusion.  Thus the
noblest men, after long conflict and suffering, at last
renounce for ever the ends they have so eagerly pursued.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
The heroes and heroines of tragedy die, purified by
suffering, after the will to live is dead.  The true import of
tragedy is that the hero expiates, not his own individual
sins, but the crime of existence itself.  Tragedy, then,
presents the highest grade of the objectification of the
will, in conflict with itself, on a scale of grandeur and
awful impressiveness.  The greatest poetry is symbolic
in this deepest sense.
</p>

<p>
Goethe may be considered one of the greatest
symbolists among poets.  Every event in life was symbolic
for him.  It expressed something more universal, more
extensive, more profound.  The concrete image, the
whole full-blooded individual was always clearly before
his mind, but beyond that he saw and realised
something more universal, from which it necessarily and
inevitably springs.  He saw that the truth of nature does
not lie on the surface, but in a deeper unity, which the
penetrative insight of the artist alone can grasp.
</p>

<p>
In the system of Schopenhauer, then, art acquires
almost the character of a religion.  It becomes the
means by which the ultimate essence, the soul of
whatever exists, is disengaged from the world of matter.
And "in this dutiful waiting upon every symbol, by
which the soul of things can be made visible, art at
last attains liberty.  In speaking to us so intimately,
so solemnly, as only religion had hitherto spoken to us,
it becomes itself a kind of religion, with all the duties
and responsibilities of the sacred ritual."
</p>

<p>
There is a deep significance in the historical fact, that
the birth of religion is interwoven invariably with that
of the origin of art.  Aristotle connects closely the rise
of various forms of poetry with religious celebrations.
Art and religion were born simultaneously, and have
always been closely related in the history of mankind.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
VIRTUE
</p>

<p>
Art, which Schopenhauer calls "the flower of life,"
enables us to forget the cares and sufferings of life.
The consolation which we derive from beauty repays
us for the miseries and terrors of existence.  The
contemplation of beauty brings us deliverance from the
deceptions and illusions of life, and gives us a pure,
true, and deep knowledge of the inner nature of the
world.  It acts as a quieter of the will, and such quiet
contemplation of beauty is the nearest approach to
pure satisfaction that we can achieve.  This deliverance,
however, is not a path out of life, but only a
consolation in life.  We must seek the highest solution in
proceeding farther in the same direction.  In his theories
on ethics and religion, Schopenhauer points the way to
a permanent escape from life.
</p>

<p>
True morality is summed up in self-surrender, in the
denial of the will to live.  There are two stages in this
progress of morality.  The first and lower is that
attained in the perfecting of the good disposition.  This
is ordinary virtue, which is rooted in love and sympathy,
and which rests on the recognition of the real identity
of any one individual with all other individuals.  The
second and higher stage is that of holiness, and is
attained only through asceticism, through the complete
self-surrender which turns away from all the pleasures
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
of life, and represses even the natural instincts.  Man
lays hold on that which is real through complete
resignation and surrender of the will.  Only then is the
veil of Mâyâ, the illusion of life, torn asunder, and is it
possible for man to be told the vision of truth.  This
is the way of virtue.  It cannot be taught any more
than genius can be taught.  Systems of ethics can
produce virtuous and holy men no more than æsthetics
can produce great poets or musicians.
</p>

<p>
In working out his ethical system, Schopenhauer was
deeply influenced by ancient Indian philosophy.  The
complete release from the slavery of the will is only to
be found, in his view, in the asceticism which is the
fundamental principle of Buddhism and of early
Christianity.  The disposition of mind, which alone leads to
true holiness and to deliverance from the world of
desire, finds expression in renunciation.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer expands his philosophy of art at far
greater length than he does his ethical system, and
seems at times to attach more significance to it.  But in
his final view it is only through virtue and holiness that
man attains to the gate of heaven.
</p>

<p>
It follows from his philosophy of the will that human
action has a significance far transcending all the
possibilities of experience.  Human action exceeds in
importance all other things in the world.  The sanest
philosophers, he held, have been those who have played
an active part in life, and who have not devoted
themselves merely to abstract thought.  It is not the highest
function of man to think and to understand, but to feel
and to live.  In short, understanding itself is attained
only through life.  For reality is greater than our
knowledge of it.  Knowledge itself is a poor thing at
best, an indirect way of seizing hold of reality.  We must
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
understand things by a deeper knowledge than that of
the intellect.  We must exchange head knowledge for
heart knowledge.  For head knowledge is concerned
only with that part of reality which rises above the
threshold of consciousness.  Our total sense of reality
is broader and deeper than a merely intellectual
knowledge.  It includes the subconscious depths of our
personality, making up a whole which is far richer in
content than that mere surface life which we know in
consciousness.
</p>

<p>
This insistence on the importance of intuitive
knowledge is closely connected with Schopenhauer's
treatment of instinct.  He is supremely interested in
instinct, finding in it a positive quality, which plays
frequently a more important part than the knowledge
of the understanding or the reason.  The one kind of
knowledge is set constantly against the other in his
system.  His treatment of the whole subject is of deep
significance in his philosophy.
</p>

<p>
The typical case in which instinct is most highly
developed is that of animals.  They strive definitely
towards an end, though this end is unknown to them.
In all the instinctive actions of animals, the will is clearly
as operative as in their other actions, but it is in blind
activity.  In inorganic and vegetable nature the will
acts as blind impulse, and so with infallible certainty.
Animals are exposed already to illusion and deception,
but in their case instinct comes to their assistance.
Though guided by no motive or knowledge, they yet
have the appearance of performing their work from
rational motives.  They work with the greatest
precision and definiteness towards an end which they do not
know.  In man also the will is in many ways only
blindly active.  Though a tendency of the will, instinct
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
does not act entirely from within.  It waits for some
external circumstance for its action.  Instinct gives
the universal, the rule; intellect gives the particular,
the application.  Instinct seems always to be in
accordance with the conception of an end, and yet is
entirely without such an end.  Schopenhauer also
connects instinct with clairvoyance and dreams.  In his
own life he attached especial importance to dreams,
and on several critical occasions regulated his actions
in accordance with them.  With his treatment of
instinct is bound up also his theory of sexual love.  The
lover is deluded in thinking that he aims at his own
happiness.  The will to live is forcing him, for nature's
own purposes, to aim at a certain typical beauty,
which has its end in the perfection of the offspring.
The more perfectly two individuals are adapted to each
other, the stronger will be their mutual passion.  Nature
is striving for a better realisation of the type, and to
attain its ends must implant a certain illusion in the
individual.  That which is good only for the species
appears to him as good for himself.  He serves the
species in imagining that he is serving himself.  This
illusion is instinct.  The individual is but a helpless
tool carrying out blindly the designs of nature.
</p>

<p>
An instinctive character belongs also to the highest
functions of human life, as in art and virtue.  Wisdom
proper, says Schopenhauer, is something intuitive, and
not something pertaining to the intellect.  It does not
consist in principles and thoughts, which are carried
about ready in the mind, as the result of research, but it
is the whole manner in which the world presents itself
intuitively to the mind.  In real life the scholar is far
surpassed by the man of the world, for the strength of
the latter consists in perfect intuitive knowledge.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
true view of life proceeds from the way in which the
world is known and understood, not from abstract
knowledge.  The heart of all knowledge is intuition.
Upon this depends the infinite superiority of genius to
learning and scholarship.  They stand to each other
as the text of a classic to its commentary.  It was this
emphasis, which Schopenhauer laid on the instinctive
and impulsive side in man, rather than on the conscious
and deliberate, which led him to the view that man is a
creature controlled and dominated by his instincts, and
therefore a mere puppet in the hands of nature.
</p>

<p>
This aspect of Schopenhauer's system acquires a
special importance, when compared with much of the
most modern philosophy.  There are interesting points
of contact with the views of M. Bergson, who maintains
that in the intuition of life we see reality as it is.
</p>

<p>
The intellect is merely a tool in the service of the
will.  Since philosophy must express the real nature
of life, we are driven to seek reality through that which
is felt.  Since the time of Socrates, Schopenhauer
maintained, philosophy has made a systematic misuse
of general conceptions.  We have an immediate
experience of the will, and therefore we may be said to
have an immediate knowledge of the nature of reality.
One of the most valuable contributions which Schopenhauer
made to the history of thought, was his insistence
on the view that philosophy must be brought back
to the recognition of the richness of an immediate and
direct knowledge of reality.  It must learn that the
meaning of things is to be realised more by living than
by thinking.  The philosopher, therefore, must be
before all things "a real man," a guide to fine living.
Schopenhauer brought philosophy into relation with
life, he drew it down from the icy heights, where
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
abstract conceptions alone can flourish, to the sunny plains
below, where art, with "a spark of the divine fire,"
warms and lightens the ways of man.  The intuitive
insight of the genius, which divines the truth through
art, is a far higher form of knowledge than that of the
abstract thinker.
</p>

<p>
It is suggestive to compare with this the view of
Pater, that "philosophy serves culture, not by the
fancied gift of absolute or transcendental knowledge,
but by suggesting questions which help one to detect
the passion, and strangeness, and dramatic contrasts
of life."
</p>

<p>
There is much significance in Schopenhauer's exaltation
of intuition over reason.  Philosophy has always
tended to make too much of reason.  And in spite
of many crudities in his psychology, Schopenhauer's
treatment of the subject contains much of the greatest
value.  In emphasising the part played in the mental
life by instinct, habit, and impulse, he anticipated much
that has since been confirmed in the modern science
of psychology.
</p>

<p>
Kant maintained that the only absolutely good
thing in the world is the good will, and Schopenhauer
practically accepts this dictum.  Right action springs
from the will, and not from the intellect, for the true
nature of man lies in his will.  The problem of ethics
for Schopenhauer is how the will is to be made good.
His treatment of the problem leads him beyond a
system of ethics to a philosophy of religion.
</p>

<p>
Virtue to Socrates was a knowledge of the good;
but no amount of mere knowledge of the good can
make the will good, and therefore Schopenhauer
maintained that Socrates had done next to nothing in ethics.
The real solution of the problem of moral obligation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
lies in sympathy.  It is through sympathy that man
is able to attain virtue.  Goodness of disposition shows
itself as pure disinterested love towards others.  And
when such love becomes perfect it places the fate of
other individuals on a level with itself and its own fate.
The character which has thus attained the highest
goodness and nobility will sacrifice its own interests,
and even its life, for the well-being of others.  Great
heroes in all ages have laid down their lives for their
country or their friends.  Others have submitted
voluntarily to death or torture for the sake of truths or
principles which they held dear.  Socrates and
Giordano Bruno, and many another hero, have suffered
death rather than deny what they held to be true.
Such heights are reached only by rare natures among
men.  But all the intermediate stages of goodness
spring from the same root of sympathy.  Pure love is
in its nature sympathy.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer is here in direct contradiction to Kant,
who recognised goodness and virtue only when they
spring from abstract reflection, from the conception
of duty, and who explained sympathy as weakness.
On the contrary, says Schopenhauer, the mere concept
is as unfruitful for virtue as it is for art.  All true and
pure love is sympathy, and all love which is not
sympathy is selfishness.  Many of our sentiments are a
combination of the two.  Friendship is always, he
says, a mixture of selfishness and sympathy.  The
selfishness lies in the pleasure which we experience in
the presence of a friend, the sympathy in the participation
in his joy or grief, and the sacrifices we make for
his sake.
</p>

<p>
Genuine virtue springs from the knowledge, which
we have through intuition, that other individuals are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
of the same nature as ourselves.  The source of morality
is this inward principle of solidarity between individual
and individual.  This sense of brotherhood, which
pervades the whole of humanity, is the real and vital
fact which makes the whole world kin.  Transcending
the spirit of egoism, which is fostered by the actual
conditions of life, there springs the spirit of altruism,
which strives to subordinate the good of the individual
to the good of the whole community, and prompts the
individual to self-denial and unselfishness.
</p>

<p>
In dealing with men, we should never, he says, take
into consideration their interested motives, their limited
intellectual capacity, nor their wrong-headedness, but
we should think only of their sufferings, their needs,
their anxieties and their misery.  Only in this way can
we feel ourselves akin, and so enter into sympathy with
others, that we experience a fellow-feeling and a desire
to help them in their need.  The two fundamental
attitudes of mind, in which the virtues and vices of men
are rooted, are envy and sympathy.  Each man bears
within himself these two diametrically opposite
characteristics.  One or the other quality becomes the
fundamental attitude of mind and the basis of action
according to the character of the individual.  Envy
builds up a strong, impregnable wall between each man
and his neighbour, isolating the individual in his crust
of misanthropy, which grows daily harder and denser.
Sympathy, on the other hand, breaks down the barriers
between man and man.  The sense of division grows
thin and transparent, until the individual feels himself a
part of an organic whole, deriving his sole usefulness
and justification only in so far as he subordinates his
own personal ends to the common good.
</p>

<p>
Schopenhauer's use of the factor of sympathy in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
explaining morality, differs considerably from that of
the English philosophers of the eighteenth century, in
whose systems of ethics sympathy played a large part.
The sympathy, which Hume presupposes as "a principle
in human nature, beyond which we cannot hope
to find any principle more general," is sympathy with
the pleasure resulting from the effects of virtuous action.
</p>

<p>
Adam Smith, who also regarded sympathy as the
ultimate element into which moral sentiments may be
analysed, approached more nearly to the position of
Schopenhauer.  Morality arises in its simplest form
from direct sympathy or "fellow-feeling" with the
passions of others, which a spectator feels from
imagining himself in their situation.  It is of two kinds, and
moves the spectator to enter into the sentiments of the
person concerned, and also moves the person concerned
"to bring down his emotions to what the spectator
can go along with."  It is a power which enables us to
take a disinterested view of our own conduct by putting
ourselves in another's position.
</p>

<p>
In Schopenhauer's view sympathy is a positive
principle of conduct.  It is based upon the recognition
of the identity of all living beings.  It alone makes
moral conduct possible, and moves us to feel and act
towards others as to ourselves.
</p>

<p>
So far Schopenhauer has described the first stage in
the progress of morality, that which is attained in
ordinary virtue.  The higher stage, that which he calls
holiness, is attained through asceticism, the denial
of the will to live.  On the path of virtue man has
learned to make no distinction between his own person
and that of others, to take as much interest in the
sufferings of others as in his own.  He is even ready to
sacrifice his own individuality, whenever such sacrifice will
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
benefit humanity.  It is no longer the changing joy
and sorrow of his own personality which concerns him,
but the joy and sorrow of all.  He attains to a vision
of the real nature of life, and realises the vain striving,
the inward conflict, and incessant suffering in which it
consists.  And with this knowledge he finds it
impossible to assert the egoistic desires of his own nature.
His will turns away from life.  He shudders at the
pleasures which recognise the assertion of life.  He
attains to the state of voluntary renunciation,
resignation, and indifference.
</p>

<p>
The attainment of this goal is the hardest end of all to
achieve.  Only the saint, the perfect man, ever attains
it completely and finally.  Weaker and less perfect
natures are ever drawn back to life by the sting of the
desires, for the veil of Mâyâ, the mist of illusion, still
clings about their feet.  The vanity and bitterness of
life still holds them, although the entrance to all
suffering stands open while they are not yet purified by
complete and final renunciation.  They cannot tear
themselves free from the illusions of life, from the
allurements of hope, and the sweetness of pleasure.
Those who see through the deceptions of life, and
recognise the real nature of the world, are already on the
way to consolation.  They withdraw from the struggle
of life, and no longer wish to assert their own
individuality.  The loftiest goodness means refraining
from all willing.
</p>

<p>
This is the transition from virtue to asceticism.  A
man who has reached so far ceases to will anything, he
guards himself against desire, and strives to attain
complete indifference to everything.  He gives the lie
to his own body, and no longer desires any gratification.
Voluntary and complete chastity and poverty are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
necessary steps in this asceticism.  Man is at once the
priest and the sacrifice.  Every kind of volition is
suppressed intentionally.  The body is nourished
sparingly, lest its vigour and well-being should arouse the
will.  Every step is taken to break and destroy the
will, which is recognised as the source of all suffering.
Death when it comes at last is welcomed as a longed-for
deliverance, and hailed with gladness.
</p>

<p>
In this picture of the life of holiness and asceticism
Schopenhauer shows the strong influence which Indian
philosophy had exercised upon his thought.  This is the
ideal life, the life of the saint, as portrayed by the early
Christian mystics, and in the Indian religious books.
</p>

<p>
Virtue and holiness proceed from inward, direct
and intuitive knowledge, and not from abstract
knowledge, as so many earlier philosophers asserted.  The
chasm between the two kinds of knowledge can be
bridged only by philosophy.  Everyone is conscious
intuitively of philosophical truths, but philosophy is
necessary to bring them to abstract knowledge and
reflection.  Hence Schopenhauer is at enmity with all
rational religion.  For religion has to do primarily
not with the intellect, but with the will and the feelings.
He felt this so deeply that he left the rational element
almost entirely out of his definition of virtue.  We learn
the meaning of virtue, in his view, through the
sympathy, which makes us feel intuitively the underlying
identity in the lives of other beings with our own life.
It is possible to express abstractly the inner nature of
holiness and asceticism as the denial of the will to live,
but this abstract theory has been known directly, and
carried into practice by countless saints and ascetics,
who all possessed the same inward knowledge, though
they used very different language with regard to it,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
according to their dogmas.  Whether a saint is moved
by the grossest superstition, or whether he be a
philosopher, makes no difference.  His conduct testifies to
his saintliness, and this proceeds from an intuitive
and direct realisation of the nature of the world.  The
dogmas he holds are merely for the satisfaction of his
intellect.  It is therefore not necessary that a saint
should be a philosopher, just as it is not necessary that
a great sculptor should be himself a beautiful man.
</p>

<p>
The use of philosophy is to gather up the whole
nature of the world in concepts, abstractly and
universally, and thus to store up "a reflected image of it
in permanent concepts always at the command of
reason."  Intuitive knowledge, on the other hand, is
expressed most perfectly in deeds and conduct, not in
abstract conceptions.  To understand it fully, therefore,
we must know examples in experience and actual
life.  A mere description of a beautiful soul is cold and
abstract.  Schopenhauer refers as models to the
biographies of the early Christian and of the Buddhist
saints, and in later times to the biography of Spinoza.
He holds up with especial admiration the life of
St. Francis of Assisi.  These records of the lives of simple,
self-denying men, mixed as they are with superstition,
are for the philosopher far more significant and
important than the lives of the great fighters and
conquerors of the world.  The life of St. Francis is of greater
import than that of Alexander the Great.  It is the ethical
aspect of action which is important, and therefore the
most significant life which the world can show is not
the conqueror of the world, but he who has in himself
subdued the world.  It is the quiet, unobserved life of
the man who has learned to deny the will to live that
is most profoundly instructive.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
</p>

<p>
This ethical teaching is no new thing.  It is only
the philosophical expression of it which is new.  As
Christianity developed, the seed of asceticism unfolded
into full flower in the writings of the saints and mystics.
Even more fully developed and more vividly expressed
is this teaching in the ancient Indian writings.  In the
Indian sacred books, in their poems, myths, and legends,
and in the lives of their saints, the love of one's neighbour
is taught, and the complete surrender of self enjoined.
Such love is not confined to humanity, but includes all
living creatures.  The path of asceticism is marked as
the ideal way for all who strive after true holiness.
There is wonderful harmony between the life of a
Christian mystic and that of a Hindu saint.  In each
case the inward life and effort is the same.  The rule
of life enjoined on both shows striking resemblances.
The renunciation of all possessions, the choice of deep,
unbroken solitude, which is spent in silent contemplation,
perfect chastity, and voluntary penance, is the
teaching of Christian and Hindu alike.  In such rare
similarity of teaching, followed by races differing so
radically in outward circumstances, Schopenhauer finds
proof that this manifestation has its root in the nature
of man, and appeals to an essential side of human, nature.
</p>

<p>
In his treatment of art, Schopenhauer points out how
happiness is achieved in the contemplation of beauty.
In his treatment of ethics he shows how permanent
happiness may be attained.  It is the man alone who
follows the path of renunciation, and who succeeds in
denying the will to live, who attains perfect happiness.
He is filled with inward joy and peace.  This joy is in
no way akin to the passionate delight experienced by
those who love life.  That is a fleeting emotion, which
has keen suffering as its correlative.  But "it is a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
peace that cannot be shaken, a deep rest and inward
serenity, a state which we cannot contemplate without
the greatest longing, when it is brought before our
imagination, because we at once recognise it as that
which infinitely surpasses anything else.  Then we feel
that every gratification won from the world is merely
like the alms which the beggar receives from life to-day,
that he may hunger again on the morrow.  Resignation,
on the other hand, is like an inherited estate, it frees
the owner for ever from all care."  He who can enter
into the spirit of the beautiful, as revealed in art, silences
his will for the moment, but the saint who attains
holiness is altogether blessed, for he silences his will, not
only for the moment, but for ever.  His will is wholly
extinguished, save for the last glimmering spark, which
retains his body in life, and which will be extinguished
only with his death.  Such a man has endured bitter
struggles with his own nature, but has emerged
triumphant.  "Nothing can trouble him more, nothing can
move him, for he has cut all the thousand cords of will
which hold us bound to the world, and as desire, fear,
envy, and anger drag us hither and thither in constant
pain.  He now looks back smiling and at rest on the
delusions of the world, which once were able to agonise
his spirit, but which now are as indifferent to him as
the chessmen when the game is ended.  Life passes
before him as a fleeting illusion, as a light morning
dream before half-waking eyes, the real world already
shining through it."
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to compare Schopenhauer's ideal of
the highest form of human life with that of Aristotle.
For Aristotle too the highest end of man was the life of
pure contemplation.  This, however, was a more purely
intellectual state than Schopenhauer had in mind, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
still an existence withdrawn from the cares and struggles
of life, wrapped securely in quiet contemplation.
</p>

<p>
It must not be supposed that when this self-surrender
has been won, that it never wavers or hesitates.  We
can never rest upon it as an assured possession.  It
must ever be attained anew by a constant battle.  For
so long as the body lives, the whole will to live exists
potentially, striving to realise itself and to burn again with
its old intensity.  The peace and blessedness which is
attained in the lives of holy men is found only as the
flower which blossoms after victory in the constant
battle with the will to live.  In the histories of the
saints we find their inner lives full of conflicts and
temptations, the end which gives the deepest peace and
opens the door of freedom constantly eluding them.
</p>

<p>
The suffering which is experienced personally is that
which most frequently produces the fullest resignation.
The illusions of life are a constant hindrance to the
fullest self-surrender.  The will must first be broken by
great personal suffering before complete self-conquest
is reached.  Then, having passed through increasing
stages of affliction, and being brought finally to the verge
of despair, a man knows himself and the world, and
rises above himself and all suffering.  He renounces
willingly everything he desired formerly, and faces death
joyfully.  This is the refined gold, which is drawn out of
the purifying flame of suffering.  Goethe has given an
incomparable picture of an unfolding of character to
such ends, in his drawing of Gretchen in Faust.
</p>

<p>
The extent to which man is free to make himself good
raises the perennial question of the freedom of the will.
Schopenhauer held that the answer depends entirely on
the statement of the problem.  In so far as the real
nature of man is will, and man himself is only a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
phenomenon of this will, a particular action follows
inevitably on a given motive in a given character.  It is just
as absurd, he says, to doubt such inevitableness as to
doubt that the three angles of any triangle are together
equal to two right angles.  If the character and the
motives were given completely, it would be possible to
calculate the future conduct of a man as exactly as we
can calculate an eclipse of the sun or moon.  Character is
as consistent as nature.  There is no independence of the
law of causality, the necessity of which extends to man
as to all else in nature.  But in the metaphysical world,
Schopenhauer, following Kant, maintains that the will
is free.  In so far as the will represents the only reality,
it transcends experience.  It is outside time, outside
every form of the mind which limits or moulds our
experience.  It is above and beyond the forms of
causality, and therefore free transcendentally.  In that
dim region where character is formed we are our own
creators.  Action which is seen empirically to follow
inevitably from a character already formed is seen from
another point of view to be but a form of self-realisation,
of self-expression.
</p>

<p>
Mysticism is strong in Schopenhauer.  Now and
again it breaks through the even flow of European
thought, usually, as with Schopenhauer, drawing its
main inspiration from the East.  There is a recurring
period in the history of thought, when the scientific
point of view does not make its accustomed appeal,
when it is felt intensely that science can give but a
partial and limited view.  Academic culture and science
are felt to be inadequate, are felt even to be leading
away from the real heart of the matter, and putting
us outside the deepest current of existence.  Intuitive
and direct knowledge is given then an importance
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
denied to the knowledge of the reason.  Man retires
into himself, instead of searching outside himself for
objective knowledge.  He seeks the secret of the
universe in the depths of his own heart and will, and strives
to pluck out the heart of life's mystery in waiting on
the silent twilight of inner feeling.  The eyes are shut
on the outer world, in order that one may see the more
inwardly.  Then only does man experience the sense
of solidarity and kinship which runs through all things,
and feel himself one with the universe.
</p>

<p>
These recurring waves of mysticism seem always to
appear in the history of thought at the end of a specially
brilliant intellectual period.  It is as though the
human mind, having striven to the top of its capacity
on the lines of the intellect and the reason, impatient
at its own limitations, and wearying of the discrepancy
between its endeavours and its achievements, turns
eagerly in the opposite direction, and directs its gaze
inward.  The great school of Neo-Platonists, for
example, followed immediately the most brilliant age of
Greek thought.  And the same is true of the strong
trend in the direction of mysticism, which is so marked
towards the close of the eighteenth and the beginning
of the nineteenth centuries in Germany, a tendency
which shows itself in Schopenhauer more strongly than
in any other philosopher.
</p>

<p>
There is a strong appeal in this ideal of human life,
which Schopenhauer depicts in words of glowing
eloquence.  Based on the pessimism which claims that all
life is worthless, it aims at conquering life by
withdrawing altogether from it.  This is a negative solution
of the problem of life.  It is possible to oppose to this
philosophy a robuster view, which would come to grips
with the misery and evil of existence on another plane.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
William James points to the spiritual gain that comes
of fighting ills.  To wage war obstinately against the
odds of life fills us with courage and resolution, and
there is possibly a deeper satisfaction to be won from
the determined facing of the battle of life than in the
attitude of pessimism, which bids us draw back and take
no part in the fray.  There is a fine courage in the
attitude of mind, which admits "the deliciousness of
insanities and realities, strivings and deadnesses, hopes
and fears, agonies and exultations," but which claims
that we who are born for the conflict, the shifting
struggle of the sunbeam in the gloom, must accept it all
as a vital part of the whole.  "When the healthy love
of life is on one, and all its forms and its appetites seem
so unutterably real; when the most brutal and the
most spiritual things are lit by the same sun, and each
is an integral part of the total richness, it seems a
grudging and sickly way of meeting so robust a universe to
shrink away from any of its facts and wish them not to
be.  Rather take the strictly dramatic point of view,
and treat the whole thing as a great unending romance
which the spirit of the universe, striving to realise its
own content, is eternally thinking out and representing
to itself."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
