RICHARD OF ALMAIGNE,</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i003a.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">"A</span> ballad made by one of the adherents to
Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, soon after
the battle of Lewes, which was fought May 14,
1264,"</p>

<p>&mdash;affords a curious specimen of ancient satire,
and shews that the liberty, assumed by the good
people of this realm, of abusing their kings and
princes at pleasure, is a privilege of very long standing.</p>

<p>To render this antique libel intelligible, the reader is to understand
that just before the battle of Lewes, which proved so fatal to
the interests of Henry III., the barons had offered his brother
Richard, King of the Romans, 30,000<i>l.</i> to procure a peace upon
such terms, as would have divested Henry of all his regal power,
and therefore the treaty proved abortive. The consequences of
that battle are well-known: the king, prince Edward his son, his
brother Richard, and many of his friends, fell into the hands of
their enemies: while two great barons of the king's party, John,
Earl of Warren, and Hugh Bigot, the king's justiciary, had been
glad to escape into France.</p>

<p>In the first stanza the aforesaid sum of thirty thousand pounds
is alluded to, but with the usual misrepresentation of party malevolence,
is asserted to have been the exorbitant demand of the
king's brother.</p>

<p>With regard to the second stanza the reader is to note that
Richard, along with the earldom of Cornwall, had the honours of
Walingford and Eyre confirmed to him on his marriage with
Sanchia, daughter of the Count of Provence, in 1243. Windsor
Castle was the chief fortress belonging to the king, and had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
garrisoned by foreigners: a circumstance which furnishes out the
burthen of each stanza.</p>

<p>The third stanza alludes to a remarkable circumstance which
happened on the day of the battle of Lewes. After the battle was
lost, Richard, king of the Romans, took refuge in a windmill,
which he barricaded, and maintained for some time against the
barons, but in the evening was obliged to surrender. See a very
full account of this in the <i>Chronicle of Mailros</i>, Oxon. 1684, p.
229.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The fourth stanza is of obvious interpretation: Richard, who
had been elected king of the Romans in 1256, and had afterwards
gone over to take possession of his dignity, was in the year 1259
about to return into England, when the barons raised a popular
clamour, that he was bringing with him foreigners to over-run the
kingdom: upon which he was forced to dismiss almost all his followers,
otherwise the barons would have opposed his landing.</p>

<p>In the fifth stanza the writer regrets the escape of the Earl of
Warren, and in the sixth and seventh stanzas insinuates that if he
and Sir Hugh Bigot once fell into the hands of their adversaries,
they should never more return home; a circumstance which fixes
the date of this ballad, for, in the year 1265, both these noblemen
landed in South Wales, and the royal party soon after gained the
ascendant. See Holinshed, Rapin, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following is copied from a very ancient MS. in the British
Museum. (Hart. MSS. 2253, fol. 58 v&deg;.) This MS. is judged,
from the peculiarities of the writing, to be not later than the time
of Richard II.; <i>th</i> being everywhere expressed by the character &thorn;;
the <i>y</i> is pointed after the Saxon manner, and the <i>i</i> hath an oblique
stroke over it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The date of the MS. in which this ballad occurs is usually
placed at an earlier period than that fixed upon by Percy. Mr.
Thomas Wright, who prints it in his volume of <i>Political Songs of</i>
<i>England</i> (Camden Society), with several other poems in French,
Anglo-Norman, and Latin, on Simon de Montfort and the Barons'
Wars, assigns it to the reign of Edward II. It will be seen from
Percy's note to verse 44, that the last stanza was printed for the
first time in the fourth edition of the <i>Reliques</i>. This is explained
by the fact that these lines are written on a new folio of the MS.,
and must therefore have been overlooked by the original copyist.</p>

<p>This little poem is without rival as an early exhibition of English
popular feeling in the vernacular; and it also stands alone as
the first dated English historical ballad in existence. It was probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>written during the first flush of enthusiasm after the memorable
battle of Lewes, because, before a year had gone by, victory had
passed to the other side, and at the battle of Evesham, fought on
the 4th of August, 1265, Simon, his eldest son Henry, and a host
of distinguished men, fell on the fatal field. As Drayton sang:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Great Lester here expired with Henry his brave sonne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When many a high exploit they in that day had done."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Prince Edward, who had passed his boyhood in Henry's company
and was much attached to him, personally attended his
funeral.</p>

<p>Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother of Henry III., was elected
King of the Romans on the 13th of January, 1256-7, at Frankfort,
and is styled in Latin documents <i>Rex Alemanni&aelig;</i>. In earlier times
Richard had been a leader of malecontents, and "all from the
child to the old man heaped frequent blessings upon him," but
Montfort (then a courtier) gained him over to the King's side, and
the insurgents were in consequence dispersed.</p>

<p>Richard was probably not so base a man as the writer of the
ballad would wish us to believe, and a good action is recorded of
him which was very ill returned. He interceded for the life of De
Montfort's second son Simon, when that youth surrendered to the
royal party at Northampton in 1266, and he was successful in his
suit. In 1271, Simon and his brother Guy assassinated Henry,
Richard's son, then in the suite of Philip of France, on his return
from the Holy Land, while he was at mass in the church of St.
Lawrence, at Viterbo. Richard himself died in this same year at
Berkhampstead, and his estates descended to his son Edmond,
Earl of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The uncertain manner in which biographic honours are apportioned
is noteworthy, and a writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (vol.
cxix. p. 26) very justly points out a deficiency in English literature,
when he writes that Simon de Montfort V., second Earl of
Leicester, "the founder of the English House of Commons, has
had no biographer."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Mr. Freeman, however, promises to do full
honour to his memory in a forthcoming volume of his history.</p>

<p>This is not the place to give any detailed account of De Montfort,
but a few words on the great leader may be allowable, more
particularly as Percy's introduction does injustice to the anti-royalist
party.</p>

<p>Simon de Montfort, fourth son of Simon de Montfort IV., fourth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>Comte de Montfort,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> married Eleanor, Countess of Pembroke,
the daughter of King John. She had made a vow of widowhood,
and although her brother Henry III. gave her away when she was
married, by one of the royal chaplains, in the king's private
chapel at Westminster, 6th January, 1238, Edmund, Archbishop of
Canterbury, remonstrated strongly against the marriage. It is
said that when the prelate left England, he stood on a hill which
commanded a view of London, and, extending his hands towards
the city, pronounced a parting blessing on his country, and a curse
on the countess and the offspring of her unholy union.</p>

<p>Events so came about that the courtier and alien became the
representative leader of Englishmen, with the famous war-cry of
"England for the English." The battle of Lewes placed everything
in the power of Simon de Montfort, but in his prosperity
many of his followers fell away from him. The last scene of the
great man's life is truly pathetic. He lay at Evesham awaiting the
troops which his son was to bring from Kenilworth. He did not
know, however, that the garrison of that town had been surprised
by Prince Edward, who had escaped from confinement. The army
that marched upon Evesham bore the banners of Simon's son,
but they were flying in the van of an enemy. Simon's first words,
when he saw the force approach, were those of soldierly pride:
"By the arm of St. James they come on well; they learnt that
order from me." Before he spoke again, however, he had realized
his position, and he cried out: "May God have mercy on our
souls, for our bodies are Prince Edward's." When he died liberty
seemed to have been crushed out of existence, but it was not so,
for his spirit lived though his body died, and the real victory was
with him.</p>

<p>The fate of Simon de Montfort was a subject of general lamentation,
but none of the songs upon it that have come down to us
are in English. In an Anglo-Norman lament he is likened to
Thomas of Canterbury, and described as "a precious flower."
Priest and layman united in his praise, and he was revered as a
saint and martyr. Prayers were said in his honour, and a hymn
was sung at his shrine, beginning:</p></div>

<p>Miracles were supposed to be worked by the power of his name,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>and the character of these miracles may be judged by the
following samples. The "old Countess of Gloucester" had a
palfrey, which was asthmatic for two years, until one day in journeying
from Tewkesbury to Evesham, it drank from the earl's well
and was restored to perfect health. The next instance of miraculous
healing is still more remarkable. A chick, which belonged
to Agnes of Selgrave, fell into a pond and was drowned. Its mistress
pulled it out and commended it to "blessed Simon," whereupon
it got up and walked as usual.</p>

<p>Simon had six children by his wife Eleanor, viz., Henry, Simon,
Guy, Amauri, Richard, and Eleanor. Henry was slain with his
father, but the countess and the other children escaped out of
England. Simon and Guy went to Tuscany; Amauri accompanied
his mother to France, was taken prisoner in 1276, and kept in
confinement by Edward for a time, but set at liberty in 1280;
Richard went to Bigorre, but nothing certain is known of his after
career, and it is said that he settled in England under the assumed
name of Wellysborne, an assertion founded on two or three deeds
of doubtful authenticity.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Eleanor was married to Llewellyn,
Prince of Wales, in 1279, Edward I. paying all the expenses of the
ceremony, which was performed with great pomp.]</p></div>

<p>&#8258; This ballad will rise in its importance with the reader,
when he finds that it is even believed to have occasioned a law
in our statute book, viz. "Against slanderous reports or tales, to
cause discord betwixt king and people." (<i>Westm. Primer</i>, c. 34,
anno 3 Edw. I.) That it had this effect is the opinion of an eminent

<h3>II.<br />

ON THE DEATH OF K. EDWARD
THE FIRST.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i010.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">We</span> have here an early attempt at elegy. Edward I.
died July 7, 1307, in the 35th year of his reign, and
69th of his age. This poem appears to have been
composed soon after his death. According to the
modes of thinking peculiar to those times, the writer dwells more
upon his devotion than his skill in government, and pays less
attention to the martial and political abilities of this great monarch,
in which he had no equal, than to some little weaknesses of superstition,
which he had in common with all his contemporaries. The
king had in the decline of life vowed an expedition to the Holy
Land, but finding his end approach, he dedicated the sum of
<i>&pound;</i>32,000 to the maintenance of a large body of knights (140 say
historians, eighty says our poet), who were to carry his heart with
them into Palestine. This dying command of the king was never
performed. Our poet, with the honest prejudices of an Englishman,
attributes this failure to the advice of the king of France,
whose daughter Isabel, the young monarch, who succeeded, immediately
married. But the truth is, Edward and his destructive
favourite, Piers Gaveston, spent the money upon their pleasures.
To do the greater honour to the memory of his heroe, our poet
puts his eloge in the mouth of the Pope, with the same poetic
licence as a more modern bard would have introduced Britannia
or the Genius of Europe pouring forth his praises.</p>

<p>This antique elegy is extracted from the same MS. volume as
the preceding article; is found with the same peculiarities of
writing and orthography; and tho' written at near the distance of
half a century contains little or no variation of idiom: whereas the
next following poem by Chaucer, which was probably written not
more than fifty or sixty years after this, exhibits almost a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
language. This seems to countenance the opinion of some antiquaries,
that this great poet made considerable innovations in his
mother tongue, and introduced many terms, and new modes of
speech from other languages.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[When Henry III. died, highly laudatory songs were sung in
honour of the new king, but when Edward I. died the people
were too grieved at their loss to sing the praise of his successor.
The present song is printed by Mr. Thomas Wright in his <i>Political</i>
<i>Songs of England</i> (Camden Society, 1839, p. 246), where he also
prints a French version, and points out that the one is clearly
translated from the other, adding that the French song was probably
the original. In verse 27, Percy printed hue (<i>i.e.</i> she) with
a capital H, under the impression that it was "the name of the
person who was to preside over the business."]</p></div>

AN ORIGINAL BALLAD BY CHAUCER.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i014.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> little sonnet, which hath escaped all the editors of
Chaucer's works, is now printed for the first time from
an ancient MS. in the Pepysian Library, that contains
many other poems of its venerable author. The versification
is of that species, which the French call <i>rondeau</i>, very
naturally Englished by our honest countrymen <i>round O</i>. Tho' so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>early adopted by them, our ancestors had not the honour of
inventing it: Chaucer picked it up, along with other better things,
among the neighbouring nations. A fondness for laborious trifles
hath always prevailed in the dark ages of literature. The Greek
poets have had their wings and axes: the great father of English
poesy may therefore be pardoned one poor solitary <i>rondeau</i>.&mdash;Geofrey
Chaucer died Oct. 25, 1400.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[These verses are printed in Morris's <i>Aldine Edition of Chaucer</i>
(vol. vi. pp. 304-5), but there is no conclusive evidence that they
are really by Chaucer. Mr. Furnivall writes (<i>Trial Forewords</i>,
Chaucer Society, 1871, p. 32):&mdash;"With the <i>Pity</i> I should like
much to class the <i>Roundel</i> ... as one of the poet's genuine
works, though it is not assigned to him (so far as I know), by any
MS. of authority. It exactly suits the <i>Compleynte of Pite</i>; there
is nothing in it (so far as I can see), to make it not Chaucer's, and
it is of the same form as his Roundel in the <i>Parliament of Foules</i>."
Mr. Hales suggests to me that the poem may have been written by
one of Chaucer's followers, and refers to verse 260 of the <i>Knight's</i>
<i>Tale</i>:</p></div>

THE TURNAMENT OF TOTTENHAM:</h3>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> does honour to the good sense of this nation, that
while all Europe was captivated with the bewitching
charms of chivalry and romance, two of our writers in
the rudest times could see thro' the false glare that
surrounded them, and discover whatever was absurd in them both.
Chaucer wrote his <i>Rhyme of Sir Thopas</i> in ridicule of the latter;
and in the following poem we have a humorous burlesque of the
former. Without pretending to decide, whether the institution of
chivalry was upon the whole useful or pernicious in the rude ages,
a question that has lately employed many good writers,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> it evidently
encouraged a vindictive spirit, and gave such force to the
custom of duelling, that there is little hope of its being abolished.
This, together with the fatal consequences which often attended
the diversion of the turnament, was sufficient to render it obnoxious
to the graver part of mankind. Accordingly the Church
early denounced its censures against it, and the State was often
prevailed on to attempt its suppression. But fashion and opinion
are superior to authority: and the proclamations against tilting
were as little regarded in those times, as the laws against duelling
are in these. This did not escape the discernment of our poet,
who easily perceived that inveterate opinions must be attacked by
other weapons, besides proclamations and censures: he accordingly
made use of the keen one of ridicule. With this view he has
here introduced, with admirable humour, a parcel of clowns,
imitating all the solemnities of the tourney. Here we have the
regular challenge&mdash;the appointed day&mdash;the lady for the prize&mdash;the
formal preparations&mdash;the display of armour&mdash;the scucheons and
devices&mdash;the oaths taken on entering the lists&mdash;the various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>accidents of the encounter&mdash;the victor leading off the prize&mdash;and the
magnificent feasting&mdash;with all the other solemn fopperies that
usually attended the pompous turnament. And how acutely the
sharpness of the author's humour must have been felt in those
days, we may learn from what we can perceive of its keenness
now, when time has so much blunted the edge of his ridicule.</p>

<p>The <i>Turnament of Tottenham</i> was first printed from an ancient
MS. in 1631, 4to., by the Rev. William Bedwell, rector of Tottenham,
who was one of the translators of the Bible. He tells us, it
was written by Gilbert Pilkington, thought to have been some time
parson of the same parish, and author of another piece, intitled,
<i>Passio Domini Jesu Christi</i>. Bedwell, who was eminently skilled
in the Oriental and other languages, appears to have been but little
conversant with the ancient writers in his own, and he so little
entered into the spirit of the poem he was publishing, that he
contends for its being a serious narrative of a real event, and
thinks it must have been written before the time of Edward III.
because turnaments were prohibited in that reign. "I do verily
beleeve," says he, "that this turnament was acted before this proclamation
of K. Edward. For how durst any to attempt to do
that, although in sport, which was so straightly forbidden, both by
the civill and ecclesiasticall power? For although they fought not
with lances, yet, as our authour sayth, 'It was no childrens game.'
And what would have become of him, thinke you, which should
have slayne another in this manner of jeasting? Would he not,
trow you, have been <i>hang'd for it in earnest? yea, and have bene</i>
<i>buried like a dogge</i>?" It is, however, well known that turnaments
were in use down to the reign of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>In the first editions of this work, Bedwell's copy was reprinted
here, with some few conjectural emendations; but as Bedwell
seemed to have reduced the orthography at least, if not the phraseology,
to the standard of his own time, it was with great pleasure
that the Editor was informed of an ancient MS. copy preserved in
the Museum (Harl. MSS. 5396), which appeared to have been
transcribed in the reign of K. Hen. VI. about 1456. This obliging
information the Editor owed to the friendship of Tho. Tyrwhitt,
Esq., and he has chiefly followed that more authentic transcript,
improved however by some readings from Bedwell's book.</p>

<p>[A writer in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (July, 1794, p. 613),
calls attention to the fact that this ballad is "a burlesque upon the
feudal custom of marrying an heiress to the knight who should
vanquish all his opponents at a solemn assembly holden for the
purpose."</p>

<p>Bedwell's MS. is now in the Cambridge public library (Ff. 5,
48), and Mr. Thomas Wright, who has printed it in a miniature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
volume, believes it to have been written as early as the reign of
Edward II.</p>

<p>Bedwell was chaplain to Sir Henry Wotton in his embassy to
Venice, where he is said to have assisted the celebrated Father
Paul in the composition of his <i>History of the Council of Trent</i>.
The following is a copy of the inscription on Bedwell's monument
in the chancel of Tottenham church:&mdash;"Here lyes interred in this
chancel Mr. William Bedwell, sometime vicar of this church and
one of King James's translators of the Bible, and for the Easterne
tongues as learned a man as most lived in these moderne times.
Aged 70. Dyed May the 5th, 1632."]</p></div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">That</span> our plain and martial ancestors could wield their
swords much better than their pens, will appear from
the following homely rhymes, which were drawn up
by some poet laureat of those days to celebrate the
immortal victory gained at Agincourt, Oct. 25, 1415. This song
or hymn is given meerly as a curiosity, and is printed from a MS.
copy in the Pepys collection, vol. i. folio. It is there accompanied
with the musical notes, which are copied on the opposite page.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[When the news of this great victory arrived in England, the
people "were literally mad with joy and triumph," and although
Henry V. on his entrance into London after the battle, commanded
that no "ditties should be made and sung by minstrels or
others" in praise of Agincourt, "for that he would whollie have
the praise and thankes altogether given to God," several songs
have come down to us on this soul-inspiring theme. Besides the
present ballad there are,</p>

<p>1. <i>Agincourte Battell</i>, beginning&mdash;</p></div>

<p>in the Percy Folio MS. (see Hales and Furnivall's edition, vol. ii.
p. 166).</p>

<p>2. <i>Agincourt, or the English Bowman's Glory</i>, a spirited ballad
quoted in Heywood's <i>King Edward IV.</i>, the first stanza of which
is as follows&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Besides these ballads there is a poem attributed to Lydgate,
and Drayton's <i>Battaile of Agincourt</i>. For further information on
the subject the reader should see Sir Nicholas Harris Nicolas's
<i>History</i> of the Battle, and Hales and Furnivall's edition of the
Percy Folio MS. (vol. ii. pp. 158, 595).</p>

<p>Dr. Rimbault describes the music attached to the present ballad
"as the first English regular composition of which we have any
remains."]</p></div>

THE NOT-BROWNE MAYD.</h3>


<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> sentimental beauties of this ancient ballad have
always recommended it to readers of taste, notwithstanding
the rust of antiquity which obscures the style
and expression. Indeed if it had no other merit than
the having afforded the groundwork to Prior's <i>Henry and Emma</i>,
this ought to preserve it from oblivion. That we are able to give
it in so correct a manner, is owing to the great care and exactness
of the accurate editor of the <i>Prolusions</i>, 8vo. 1760; who has
formed the text from two copies found in two different editions of
Arnolde's <i>Chronicle</i>, a book supposed to be first printed about
1521. From the copy in the <i>Prolusions</i> the following is printed,
with a few additional improvements gathered from another edition
of Arnolde's book<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> preserved in the public library at Cambridge.
All the various readings of this copy will be found here, either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>received into the text, or noted in the margin. The references to
the <i>Prolusions</i> will shew where they occur. In our ancient folio
MS.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> described in the preface, is a very corrupt and defective copy
of this ballad, which yet afforded a great improvement in one
passage. See v. 310.</p>

<p>It has been a much easier task to settle the text of this poem,
than to ascertain its date. The ballad of the <i>Nutbrowne Mayd</i>
was first revived in <i>The Muses Mercury</i> for June, 1707, 4to. being
prefaced with a little <i>Essay on the old English Poets and Poetry</i>;
in which this poem is concluded to be "near 300 years old," upon
reasons which, though they appear inconclusive to us now, were
sufficient to determine Prior, who there first met with it. However,
this opinion had the approbation of the learned Wanley, an
excellent judge of ancient books. For that whatever related to
the reprinting of this old piece was referred to Wanley, appears
from two letters of Prior's preserved in the British Museum (Harl.
MSS. No. 3777). The editor of the <i>Prolusions</i> thinks it cannot
be older than the year 1500, because, in Sir Thomas More's tale
of <i>The Serjeant</i>, &amp;c., which was written about that time, there
appears a sameness of rhythmus and orthography, and a very near
affinity of words and phrases with those of this ballad. But this
reasoning is not conclusive, for if Sir Thomas More made this
ballad his model, as is very likely, that will account for the sameness
of measure, and in some respect for that of words and phrases,
even tho' this had been written long before; and as for the orthography,
it is well known that the old printers reduced that of
most books to the standard of their own times. Indeed it is
hardly probable that an antiquary like Arnolde would have inserted
it among his historical collections, if it had been then a
modern piece; at least he would have been apt to have named its
author. But to shew how little can be inferred from a resemblance
of rhythmus or style, the Editor of these volumes has in his ancient
folio MS. a poem on the victory of Flodden-field, written in the
same numbers, with the same alliterations, and in orthography,
phraseology, and style nearly resembling the <i>Visions of Pierce</i>
<i>Plowman</i>, which are yet known to have been composed above 160
years before that battle. As this poem is a great curiosity, we
shall give a few of the introductory lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Grant gracious God, grant me this time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may say, or I cease, thy selven to please;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mary his mother, that maketh all this world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the seemlie saints, that sitten in heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will carpe of kings, that conquered full wide,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That dwelled in this land, that was alyes noble;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Henry the seaventh, that soveraigne lord," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With regard to the date of the following ballad, we have taken
a middle course, neither placed it so high as Wanley and Prior,
nor quite so low as the editor of the <i>Prolusions</i>; we should have
followed the latter in dividing every other line into two, but that
the whole would then have taken up more room than could be
allowed it in this volume.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The edition of Richard Arnold's <i>Chronicle</i> (1521) mentioned
above, is the second; and the first, which is undated, was printed
at Antwerp in 1502. This edition is described in Brydges' <i>Censur&auml;</i>
<i>Literaria</i> (vol. vi. p. 114), where the <i>Nut-Brown Maid</i> is printed.
A copy from the Balliol MS. 354, of about the same date, is
printed in Percy's folio manuscript, ed. Hales and Furnivall,
vol iii. p. 174. Warton will not allow that the poem was written
before the beginning of the sixteenth century, but as Percy says,
it is highly improbable that an antiquary would insert a modern
piece in his miscellany of curiosities.</p>

<p>Percy has inserted the following note in his folio MS.: "From
the concluding words of this last stanza&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">['but men wold that men shold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">be kind to them eche one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">yett I had rather, god to obay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and serve but him alone']<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>it should seem that the author was a woman."</p>

<p>Mr. Skeat remarks that the part of the fourth stanza before the
woman speaks, and the first two verses, are still more conclusive
on this point. On the other side it is noticeable that the author
speaks as a man at line 353:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... that we may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them be comfortable;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>but this may only be a blind.</p>

<p>Few readers will agree with Percy's estimate of Prior's poem,
and <i>Henry and Emma</i> is now only remembered because of its
connection with the <i>Nut-Brown Maid</i>.</p>

<p>Warton justly points out how the simplicity of the original is
decorated, dilated, and consequently spoilt by Prior, who crowds
his verses with zephyrs, Chloe, Mars, the Cyprian deity, &amp;c. Such
lay figures as these are quite out of keeping with the realities of
this most exquisite poem.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<p>One instance of Prior's inability to appreciate the beauties of his
original will be sufficient. The tender allusion at v. 232-3:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O my swete mother, before all other<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For you I have most drede,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>followed by the reflection:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But nowe adue! I must ensue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where fortune doth me lede,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>is entirely omitted by the later poet, who changes</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To shorte my here, a bowe to bere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shote in tyme of nede,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>into</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wanting the scissors, with these hands I'll tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(If that obstructs my flight) this load of hair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>Nut-Brown Maid</i> has always been highly popular (a proof
of the good taste of the people), and in consequence it figures in
Captain Cox's collection described by Laneham. Another proof
of its popularity is the existence of various parodies, one of
which is of very early date.</p>

<p>It was a common practice in the sixteenth century to turn ordinary
ballads into religious songs. <i>The New Nutbrowne Maid</i>,
printed by John Skot about 1520, reprinted by George Isted in
1820 for the Roxburghe Club, and again reprinted by Dr. Rimbault
for the Percy Society (vol. iv.), 1842, is an instance of this
practice. It is a close parody of the original, and purports to be
"upon the passion of Cryste." The <i>he</i> and <i>she</i> are changed to
<i>Maria the mayde</i> and <i>Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>Another version is given in the Percy folio MS. (ed. Hales and
Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 334), which is entitled <i>A Jigge</i>.</p>

<p>The incidents are vulgarized, "but," Mr. Hales observes, "the
beauty of the original is too great to be altogether destroyed, however
rude the hands that handle it. Something of the charm of the
<i>Nut Brown Maid</i> lingers around this <i>Jig</i>."]</p></div>

A BALET BY THE EARL RIVERS.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i048.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> amiable light in which the character of Anthony
Widville, the gallant Earl Rivers, has been placed by
the elegant author of the <i>Catal. of Noble Writers</i>
[Horace Walpole], interests us in whatever fell from his
pen. It is presumed, therefore, that the insertion of this little
sonnet will be pardoned, tho' it should not be found to have much
poetical merit. It is the only original poem known of that nobleman's;
his more voluminous works being only translations. And
if we consider that it was written during his cruel confinement in
Pomfret castle a short time before his execution in 1483, it gives
us a fine picture of the composure and steadiness with which this
stout earl beheld his approaching fate.</p>

<p>This ballad we owe to Rouse, a contemporary historian, who
seems to have copied it from the earl's own handwriting. "In
tempore," says this writer, "incarcerationis apud Pontem-fractum
edidit unum <i>balet</i> in anglicis, ut mihi monstratum est, quod subsequitur
sub his verbis: <i>Sum what musyng</i>, &amp;c." Rossi, <i>Hist.</i> 8vo.
2 ed. p. 213. In Rouse the second stanza, &amp;c. is imperfect, but
the defects are here supplied from a more perfect copy printed in
<i>Ancient Songs, from the time of King Henry III. to the Revolution</i>,
p. 87 [by Joseph Ritson].</p>

<p>This little piece, which perhaps ought rather to have been
printed in stanzas of eight short lines, is written in imitation of a
poem of Chaucer's, that will be found in Urry's ed. 1721, p. 555,
beginning thus:</p>

CUPID'S ASSAULT: BY LORD VAUX.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i050.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> reader will think that infant poetry grew apace between
the times of Rivers and Vaux, tho' nearly contemporaries;
if the following song is the composition of
that Sir Nicholas (afterwards Lord) Vaux, who was the
shining ornament of the court of Henry VII., and died in the year
1523 [1524, see below].</p>

<p>And yet to this lord it is attributed by Puttenham in his <i>Art of</i>
<i>Eng. Poesie</i>, 1589, 4to., a writer commonly well informed. Take
the passage at large: "In this figure [Counterfait Action] the Lord
Nicholas Vaux, a noble gentleman and much delighted in vulgar
making, and a man otherwise of no great learning, but having
herein a marvelous facilitie, made a dittie representing the Battayle
and Assault of Cupide, so excellently well, as for the gallant and
propre application of his fiction in every part, I cannot choose but
set downe the greatest part of his ditty, for in truth it cannot be
amended. <i>When Cupid Scaled</i>," &amp;c. p. 200. For a farther account
of Nicholas, Lord Vaux, see Mr. Walpole's <i>Noble Authors</i>,
vol. i.</p>

<p>Since this song was first printed off, reasons have occurred which
incline me to believe that Lord Vaux, the poet, was not the Lord
Nicholas Vaux who died in 1523, but rather a successor of his in
the title. For, in the first place, it is remarkable that all the old
writers mention Lord Vaux, the poet, as contemporary, or rather
posterior, to Sir Thomas Wyat and the E. of Surrey, neither of
which made any figure till long after the death of the first Lord
Nicholas Vaux. Thus Puttenham, in his <i>Art of English Poesie</i>,
1589, in p. 48, having named Skelton, adds: "In the latter end
of the same kings raigne [Henry VIII.] sprong up a new company
of courtly Makers [Poets], of whom Sir Thomas Wyat th' elder,
and Henry Earl of Surrey were the two chieftaines, who having
travailed into Italie, and there tasted the sweet and stately measures
and stile of the Italian poesie ... greatly polished our
rude and homely manner of vulgar poesie.... In the same time,
or not long after, was the Lord Nicholas Vaux, a man of much
facilitie in vulgar makings."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Webbe, in his <i>Discourse of English</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><i>Poetrie</i>, 1586, ranges them in the following order: "The E. of
Surrey, the Lord Vaux, Norton, Bristow." And Gascoigne, in the
place quoted in the first volume of this work [B. ii. No. 2.] mentions
Lord Vaux after Surrey. Again, the stile and measure of
Lord Vaux's pieces seem too refined and polished for the age of
Henry VII., and rather resemble the smoothness and harmony of
Surrey and Wyat, than the rude metre of Skelton and Hawes.
But what puts the matter out of all doubt, in the British Museum
is a copy of his poem, <i>I lothe that I did love</i> [vid. vol. i. <i>ubi supra</i>],
with this title, "A dyttye or sonet made by the Lord Vaus, in the
time of the noble Quene Marye, representing the image of Death."
Harl. MSS. No. 1703, sec. 25.</p>

<p>It is evident then that Lord Vaux, the poet, was not he that
flourished in the reign of Henry VII., but either his son or grandson;
and yet, according to Dugdale's <i>Baronage</i>, the former was
named Thomas and the latter William: but this difficulty is not
great, for none of the old writers mention the Christian name of
the poetic Lord Vaux,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> except Puttenham; and it is more likely
that he might be mistaken in that lord's name, than in the time in
which he lived, who was so nearly his contemporary.</p>

<p>Thomas, Lord Vaux, of Harrowden, in Northamptonshire, was
summoned to parliament in 1531. When he died does not appear,
but he probably lived till the latter end of Queen Mary's
reign, since his son William was not summoned to parliament till
the last year of that reign, in 1558. This lord died in 1595. See
Dugdale, vol. ii. p. 304. Upon the whole I am inclined to believe
that Lord Thomas was the poet.</p>

<p>The following copy is printed from the first edition of Surrey's
<i>Poems</i>, 1557, 4to. See another song of Lord Vaux's in the preceding
volume, B. ii. No. 2.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Percy is correct in his supposition that the poet was Thomas,
second Lord Vaux, and not his father Nicholas, who died May
14th, 1524, only seventeen days after he was advanced to the
peerage.]</p></div>

SIR ALDINGAR.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i054t.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> old fabulous legend is given from the Editor's folio
MS. with conjectural emendations, and the insertion of
some additional stanzas to supply and compleat the
story.</p>

<p>It has been suggested to the Editor that the author of this poem
seems to have had in his eye the story of Gunhilda, who is sometimes
called Eleanor, and was married to the Emperor (here called
King) Henry.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Percy's MS. note in his folio is as follows: "Without some
corrections this will not do for my <i>Reliques</i>." Readers will be able
to judge for themselves as to the relative beauties of the two, now
that the original is printed at the end of Percy's amended copy.
To make the interpolations more apparent, Percy's added verses
are placed between brackets, and it will be seen that these contain
much of the phraseology and many of the stock prettinesses of the
polite ballad-monger; some of the most vivid bits of the old ballad
being passed over. Percy keeps tolerably to the story, except
that he makes the second messenger one of the queen's damsels
instead of a man. Sir Walter Scott supposes <i>Sir Aldingar</i> to be
founded upon the kindred ballad of <i>Sir Hugh le Blond</i>, but, as
Professor Child says, without any reason. The story occurs in
most of the literatures of Europe.</p></div>

THE GABERLUNYIE MAN.</h3>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">A Scottish Song.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i067.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Tradition</span> informs us that the author of this song was
King James V. of Scotland. This prince (whose character
for wit and libertinism bears a great resemblance to
that of his gay successor, Charles II.) was noted for
strolling about his dominions in disguise,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> and for his frequent gallantries
with country girls. Two adventures of this kind he hath
celebrated with his own pen, viz. in this ballad of <i>The Gaberlunyie</i>
<i>Man</i>; and in another intitled <i>The Jolly Beggar</i>, beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thair was a jollie beggar, and a begging he was boun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he tuik up his quarters into a land'art toun.<br /></span>
<span class="i41">Fa, la, la," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It seems to be the latter of these ballads (which was too licentious
to be admitted into this collection) that is meant in the
<i>Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors</i>,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> where the ingenious writer
remarks, that "there is something very ludicrous in the young
woman's distress when she thought her first favour had been
thrown away upon a beggar."</p>

<p>Bishop Tanner has attributed to James V. the celebrated ballad
of <i>Christ's Kirk on the Green</i>, which is ascribed to King James I.
in Bannatyne's MS. written in 1568: and, notwithstanding that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>authority, the editor of this book is of opinion that Bishop Tanner
was right.</p>

<p>King James V. died Dec. 13th, 1542, aged 33.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[James V. was called the <i>King of the Commons</i>, from his popular
manners and vagrant habit, and many stories are told of his adventures
when in disguise. One of these is worth relating here.
On a certain occasion he heard himself abused by a country lad
as a tyrant and a man odious in every respect, until, unable to restrain
himself, he threw off his disguise, and told his accuser that
he was the king. "Are you really the king?" said the lad, retaining
his self-possession; "weel, ye'll maybe hae heard o' my father:
he gaed daft three days regularly every year, and in a' that time
spoke naething but lies and nonsense: now I'm exactly the same
way, and this is <i>one of my three days</i>." There is no authority for
attributing the present song to James V., except ancient and
universal tradition. The word <i>gaberlunyie</i> is compounded of <i>gaber</i>,
a wallet, and <i>lunyie</i>, the loins: hence a travelling tinker or beggar
carrying a wallet by his side, was called a "gaberlunyie man."
Scott has sketched a vivid portrait of one of these privileged beggars
in his <i>Antiquary</i>, Edie Ochiltree, to wit. The <i>Jolly Beggar</i> is
printed in Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, ii. 164, and in Ritson's <i>Scottish</i>
<i>Songs</i>, i. 168. Competent authorities are not willing to take the
credit of the authorship of <i>Christ's Kirk on the Green</i> from
James I. and give it to James V.]</p></div>

ON THOMAS LORD CROMWELL.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i071.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> is ever the fate of a disgraced minister to be forsaken
by his friends, and insulted by his enemies, always
reckoning among the latter the giddy inconstant multitude.
We have here a spurn at fallen greatness from
one of the angry partisans of declining popery, who could never
forgive the downfall of their Diana and loss of their craft. The
ballad seems to have been composed between the time of Cromwell's
commitment to the Tower, June 10th, 1540, and that of his
being beheaded, July 28 following. A short interval! but Henry's
passion for Catharine Howard would admit of no delay. Notwithstanding
our libeller, Cromwell had many excellent qualities;
his great fault was too much obsequiousness to the arbitrary will
of his master; but let it be considered that this master had raised
him from obscurity, and that the high-born nobility had shewn
him the way in every kind of mean and servile compliance. The
original copy, printed at London in 1540, is intitled, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span><i>A newe</i>
<i>ballade made of Thomas Crumwel, called</i> "<i>Trolle on away</i>." To it
is prefixed this distich by way of burthen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Trolle on away, trolle on awaye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Synge heave and howe rombelowe trolle on away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following piece gave rise to a poetic controversy, which
was carried on thro' a succession of seven or eight ballads, written
for and against Lord Cromwell. These are all preserved in the
archives of the Antiquarian Society, in a large folio collection of
proclamations, &amp;c., made in the reigns of King Henry VIII., King
Edward VI., Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, King James I., &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Thomas Cromwell, called <i>Malleus Monachorum</i>, came of a
good old Lincolnshire family. He was born about the year 1490
at Putney, where his father carried on the business of an iron-founder,
which his enemies reduced to that of a blacksmith. His
father died early, and in consequence of the re-marriage of his
mother, he became a wanderer.</p>

<p>The author of the poor play, entitled <i>The Life and Death of</i>
<i>Thomas Lord Cromwell</i>, which has been absurdly attributed to
Shakspere, makes "old Cromwell, a blacksmith, of Putney," live to
see his son "made lord keeper."</p>

<p>There is a fragment of a ballad on Cromwell without any beginning
in the Folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. i. p. 127),
which ends as follows:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How now? How now? the king did say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thomas how is it with thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hanging and drawing O King! he saide;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You shall never gett more from me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Hales points out a coincidence not mentioned by Mr.
Froude, viz. that the minister was beheaded and the king married
to Catherine Howard on one and the same day. In 1525 Cromwell
undertook for Wolsey the work of visiting and breaking up
the small monasteries which the Pope had granted for the foundation
of Wolsey's new colleges, thus commencing the work which
gained him the enmity of the adherents of the old faith. He was
the first to cause Bibles in the English language to be deposited in
all the churches, and to him we owe the institution of parish registers.]</p></div>

HARPALUS.</h3>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">An Ancient English Pastoral.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i075.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> beautiful poem, which is perhaps the first attempt
at pastoral writing in our language, is preserved among
the <i>Songs and Sonnettes</i> of the Earl of Surrey, &amp;c., 4to.
in that part of the collection which consists of pieces
by <i>uncertain auctours</i>. These poems were first published in 1557,
ten years after that accomplished nobleman fell a victim to the
tyranny of Henry VIII.; but it is presumed most of them were
composed before the death of Sir Thomas Wyatt in 1541. See
Surrey's Poems, 4to. fol. 19, 49.</p>

<p>Tho' written perhaps near half a century before the <i>Shepherd's</i>
<i>Calendar</i>,<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> this will be found far superior to any of those eclogues,
in natural unaffected sentiments, in simplicity of style, in easy flow
of versification, and all other beauties of pastoral poetry. Spenser
ought to have profited more by so excellent a model.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Warton describes this poem as "perhaps the first example in
our language now remaining of the pure and unmixed pastoral,
and in the erotic species for ease of numbers, elegance of rural
allusion excelling everything of the kind in Spenser, who is erroneously
ranked as our earliest English bucolic." He did not,
however, take into account <i>Robin and Makine</i>, which follows
<i>Harpalus</i> in this book, but was written more than half a century
before it. Spenser-lovers also are not likely to agree with Percy's
and Warton's summary judgments upon the <i>Shepherd's Calendar</i>.]</p></div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> palm of pastoral poesy is here contested by a contemporary
writer with the author of the foregoing.
The critics will judge of their respective merits; but
must make some allowance for the preceding ballad,
which is given simply as it stands in the old editions; whereas this,
which follows, has been revised and amended throughout by
Allan Ramsay, from whose <i>Evergreen</i>, vol. i. it is here chiefly
printed. The curious reader may, however, compare it with the
more original copy, printed among <i>Ancient Scottish Poems</i>, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>MS. of George Bannatyne, 1568, Edinburgh, 1770, 12mo. Mr.
Robert Henryson (to whom we are indebted for this poem) appears
to so much advantage among the writers of eclogue, that we
are sorry we can give little other account of him besides what is
contained in the following eloge, written by W. Dunbar, a Scottish
poet, who lived about the middle of the sixteenth century:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Dunfermline he [Death] hes done roun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gud Maister Robert Henrisoun."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Indeed, some little further insight into the history of this Scottish
bard is gained from the title prefixed to some of his poems
preserved in the British Museum, viz. <i>The morall Fabillis of Esop</i>,
compylit be Maister Robert Henrisoun, scolmaister of Dumfermling,
1571. Harl. MSS. 3865, &sect; 1.</p>

<p>In Ramsay's <i>Evergreen</i>, vol. i. are preserved two other little
Doric pieces by Henryson: the one intitled <i>The Lyon and the</i>
<i>Mouse</i>, the other <i>The garment of gude Ladyis</i>. Some other of his
poems may be seen in the <i>Ancient Scottish Poems</i>, printed from
Bannatyne's MS. above referred to.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This remarkable poem is peculiarly interesting as being the
earliest specimen of pastoral poetry in the language. Campbell
calls it "the first known pastoral, and one of the best in a dialect
rich with the favours of the pastoral muse." Langhorne writes
justly:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In gentle Henryson's unlaboured strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Arethusa's shepherd breath'd again."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Percy errs in describing Henryson as a contemporary of Surrey,
as the Scottish poet lived half a century before the English one.
The dates of his birth and death are not known, but he flourished
in the reign of James III. (1460-1488). "On the 10th of September,
1462, the venerable master Robert Henrysone, Licentiate in
Arts and Bachelor in Degrees, was incorporated or admitted a
member of the newly founded University of Glasgow." He was a
notary public, and probably the master of the grammar school attached
to the Abbey of Dunfermline, not as might be supposed a
mere parish schoolmaster. According to the tradition of the last
century, our poet was the representative of the family of Henryson
or Henderson, of Fordell, in the county of Fife; but Mr. David
Laing thinks that it is a gratuitous assumption to suppose that he
or his predecessors ever possessed a single acre of the lands of
Fordell.</p>

<p>Percy has used the version given in Ramsay's <i>Evergreen</i>, which
is slightly altered in diction from the original in the Bannatyne
MS.; for instance, the last stanza occurs in the latter as follows:</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Makyne went hame blyth anneuche,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Attour the holltis hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robene murnit, and Makyne leuche;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Scho sang, he sichit sair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so left him, bayth wo and wreuch,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In dolour and in cair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kepand his hird under a huche<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Amangis the holtis hair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the <i>Evergreen</i> version, the last verse is altered to "Amang
the rushy gair," either because the words "holtis hair" occur in verse
two of the stanza, or that the Editor saw an impropriety in the close
vicinity of the similar words <i>holt</i> and <i>heuch</i>. The two words
"holtis hair" are explained as hoary hills or hoary woods, but
Finlay (<i>Scottish Historical and Romantic Ballads</i>, 1808, vol. ii. p. 193)
holds that "hair" really means high, and derives it from Isl. har ==
altus. He says that a high rock in some of the northern counties
of Scotland, where the dialect is strongly tinctured with Danish, is
called "hair craig," and that the same word lingers on in the Hare-stone
of the Borough Moor, Edinburgh, which obtained its name
in the following manner: The laird of Pennycuik held certain
lands by a strange tenure. He was obliged to mount a large stone
or rock, and salute the king with three blasts of a horn whenever
he passed that way. This rock or eminence was called the "Hare-stone,"
and still exists near Morningside Church. Hoary, however,
is to be understood as grey and not as white with snow, so that
the hare-stone is probably the grey stone. The word holt may
also mean a heath, and C&aelig;dmon uses the phrase "har h&aelig;&eth;" = hoar
or grey heath.</p>

<p>The date (1571) attached to Henryson's version of <i>&AElig;sop's</i>
<i>Fables</i> is that of transcription. It is not known when the Fables
were first printed, but they were reprinted by Robert Lekpreuik
for Henry Charteris in 1570. They are supposed to have been
written between 1470 and 1480.</p>

<p>Henryson wrote several other short poems, as well as the <i>Testament</i>
<i>of Cresseid</i>, written as a continuation or supplement to
Chaucer's <i>Troilus and Cresseide</i>, all of which have been collected
for the first time into an elegant volume by David Laing, who has
added notes and a memoir of the poet (Edinburgh, 1865).</p>

<p>This <i>Testament</i> has a particular interest for us, because Shakspere
referred to it when he wrote "Cressida was a beggar"
(<i>Twelfth Night</i>, act iii. sc. 1). The lines in Henryson's poem
which illustrate this passage, are as follows:</p></div>

GENTLE HERDSMAN, TELL TO ME.</h3>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">Dialogue Between a Pilgrim and Herdsman.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i086.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> scene of this beautiful old ballad is laid near Walsingham,
in Norfolk, where was anciently an image of
the Virgin Mary, famous over all Europe for the numerous
pilgrimages made to it, and the great riches it
possessed. Erasmus has given a very exact and humorous description
of the superstitions practised there in his time. See his
account of the <i>Virgo parathalassia</i>, in his colloquy, intitled, <i>Peregrinatio</i>
<i>religionis ergo</i>. He tells us, the rich offerings in silver,
gold, and precious stones, that were there shewn him, were incredible,
there being scarce a person of any note in England, but
what some time or other paid a visit, or sent a present to <i>our lady</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span><i>of Walsingham</i>.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538,
this splendid image, with another from Ipswich, was carried to
Chelsea, and there burnt in the presence of commissioners; who,
we trust, did not burn the jewels and the finery.</p>

<p>This poem is printed from a copy in the Editor's folio MS.
which had greatly suffered by the hand of time; but vestiges of
several of the lines remaining, some conjectural supplements have
been attempted, which, for greater exactness, are in this one ballad
distinguished by italicks.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>[The shrine of the Virgin at Walsingham was the favourite English
resort of pilgrims for nearly four hundred years, and the people
of Norfolk were in great distress when their image was taken away
from them, and the stream of votaries was suddenly stopped. In
a copy of the <i>Reliques</i> in the library of the British Museum, there
is a MS. note by William Cole to the following effect: "I was
lately informed that the identical image of our lady of Walsingham
being mured up in an old wall, and there discovered on pulling
it down, was presented by the Earl of Leicester (Coke) to a
relative of his of the Roman Catholic religion."</p>

<p>The shrine was connected with a Priory of Augustinian Canons,
which was founded during the episcopate of William Turbus,
Bishop of Norwich (1146-1174). When Henry III. made his
pilgrimage to the shrine in the year 1241, it had long been famous,
and was probably more frequented even than the tomb of St.
Thomas a Becket at Canterbury. Foreigners of all nations came
hither on pilgrimage, and in number and quality the devotees appear
to have equalled those who toiled to the Lady of Loretto in
Italy. Several of our kings visited the shrine after Henry III.
had set the example. Edward I. was there in 1280 and in 1296,
Edward II. in 1315, and Edward IV. and his queen in 1469.
Henry VII. offered his prayers in "our Lady's Church" at Christmas
time 1486-7, and in the following summer, after the battle of
Stoke, "he sent his banner to be offered to our Lady of Walsingham,
where before he made his vows." Spelman gives on hearsay
evidence the report that Henry VIII., in the second year of his
reign, walked barefoot to Walsingham from a neighbouring village,
and then presented a valuable necklace to the image.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>Bartholomew, Lord Burghersh, K.G., by his will made in 1369, ordered a
statue of himself on horseback to be made in silver, and offered
to our Lady of Walsingham; and Henry VII., in his lifetime, gave
a kneeling figure of himself. There are numerous references to
Walsingham in the <i>Paston Letters</i>, and in 1443 we find Margaret
Paston writing to her husband to tell him that her mother had
vowed another image of wax of his own weight, to "our Lady of
Walsingham," and that she herself had vowed to go on pilgrimage
there for him. (Ed. Fenn, iii. 22.)</p>

<p>The total income of the place (including the offerings) was reported
to be <i>&pound;</i>650 in the twenty-sixth year of Henry VIII.'s
reign, and Roger Ascham, when visiting Cologne in 1550, makes
this remark: "The Three Kings be not so rich, I believe, as was
the Lady of Walsingham." Now the treasures at Cologne are
said to have been worth six millions of francs (<i>&pound;</i>240,000).</p>

<p>The road to Walsingham was a well-frequented one, and a cross
was set up in every town it passed through. An old track running
by Newmarket, Brandon, and Castle Acre, which was used by the
pilgrims, was known as the "Palmer's Way" or "Walsingham
Green Way."</p>

<p>The Milky Way ("the Watling-street of the heavens," as Chaucer
has it) has been associated with pilgrimages in several countries.
In Norfolk, the long streaming path of light was supposed to
point the pilgrim on his road to Walsingham, and was in consequence
called the "Walsingham Way." In Italy, in France, and
in the north of Europe it has been called "St. Jago's Way,"
"Jacobsstrasse," &amp;c., as pointing the way to Compostella, and one
of its Turkish names is "The Hadji's Way," as indicating the
road to Mecca.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>Among the Rawlinson MSS. in the Bodleian Library is <i>A</i>
<i>Lament for Walsingham</i>, in the handwriting of Philip, Earl of
Arundel, the third stanza of which is as follows:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

K. EDWARD IV. AND TANNER OF

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i092.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Was</span> a story of great fame among our ancestors. The
author of the <i>Art of English poesie</i>, 1589, 4to, seems to
speak of it as a real fact.&mdash;Describing that vicious mode
of speech, which the Greeks called <i>Acyron</i>, <i>i.e.</i> "When
we use a dark and obscure word, utterly repugnant to that we
should express;" he adds, "Such manner of uncouth speech did
the Tanner of Tamworth use to king Edward the fourth; which
Tanner, having a great while mistaken him, and used very broad
talke with him, at length perceiving by his traine that it was the
king, was afraide he should be punished for it, [and] said thus,
with a certain rude repentance,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>I hope I shall be hanged to-morrow</i>,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>for [<i>I feare me</i>] <i>I shall be hanged</i>; whereat the king laughed a
good,<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> not only to see the Tanner's vaine feare, but also to heare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>his illshapen terme: and gave him for recompence of his good
sport, the inheritance of Plumpton-parke. <i>I am afraid</i>," concludes
this sagacious writer, "<i>the poets of our times that speake more</i>
<i>finely and correctedly, will come too short of such a reward</i>," p. <a href="#Page_214">214</a>.&mdash;The
phrase, here referred to, is not found in this ballad at present,<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
but occurs with some variation in another old poem, intitled <i>John</i>
<i>the Reeve</i>, described in the following volume (see the Preface to
<i>the King and the Miller</i>),<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> viz.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay, sayd John, by Gods grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Edward wer in this place,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hee shold not touch this tonne:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wold be wroth with John <i>I hope</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereffore I beshrew the soupe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That in his mouth shold come."   Pt. ii. st. 24.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following text is selected (with such other corrections as
occurred) from two copies in black-letter. The one in the Bodleyan
library, intitled, "A merrie, pleasant, and delectable historie
betweene K. Edward the Fourth, and a Tanner of Tamworth, &amp;c.
printed at London, by John Danter, 1596." This copy, ancient as
it now is, appears to have been modernized and altered at the time
it was published; and many vestiges of the more ancient readings
were recovered from another copy, (though more recently printed,)
in one sheet folio, without date, in the Pepys collection.</p>

<p>But these are both very inferior in point of antiquity to the old
ballad of <i>The King and the Barker</i>, reprinted with other "Pieces
of Ancient Popular Poetry from Authentic Manuscripts and old
Printed Copies, &amp;c." Lond. 1791, 8vo. As that very antique
Poem had never occurred to the Editor of the Reliques, till he
saw it in the above collection, he now refers the curious reader to
it, as an imperfect and incorrect copy of the old original ballad.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This ballad was a great favourite with our ancestors and is
probably of considerable antiquity.</p>

<p>The earliest entry of it upon the Registers of the Stationers'
Company is to William Griffith in 1564, but no such edition is
known to bibliographers. It is possible, however, that Puttenham
may have found the line quoted above&mdash;</p></div>

<p>It belongs to the large class of tales in which the sovereign is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>made to converse on terms of good fellowship with a humble subject.</p>

<p>The interesting ballad of <i>John the Reeve</i> referred to by Percy is
printed for the first time in Hales and Furnivall's edition of the
Folio Manuscript (vol. ii. p. 550.)</p>

<p>The Tanner of Tamworth is introduced into the first part of
Heywood's <i>Edward IV.</i> The ballad <i>Under the greenwood tree</i>,
among the Ashmole MSS. at Oxford, <i>Robin Hood and the Curtal</i>
<i>Friar</i>, and <i>Robin Hood and the Monk</i>, all begin with the same
words as this ballad&mdash;</p></div>

Selden's <i>Titles of Honour</i>, who produces it as a good authority
to prove, that one mode of creating <i>Esquires</i> at that time, was by
the imposition of a <i>Collar</i>. His words are, "Nor is that old
pamphlet of the Tanner of Tamworth and King Edward the
Fourth so contemptible, but that wee may thence note also an
observable passage, wherein the use of making Esquires, by giving
Collars, is expressed." (Sub Tit. Esquire; &amp; vide in Spelmanni
Glossar. Armiger.) This form of creating Esquires actually exists
at this day among the Serjeants at Arms, who are invested with a
Collar (which they wear on Collar Days) by the King himself.

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> scene of this song is the same as in Num. XIV. The
pilgrimage to Walsingham suggested the plan of many
popular pieces. In the Pepys collection, vol. i. p. 226,
is a kind of Interlude in the old ballad style, of which
the first stanza alone is worth reprinting.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As I went to Walsingham,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the shrine with speede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met I with a jolly palmer<br /></span>

<p>The pilgrimages undertaken on pretence of religion, were often
productive of affairs of gallantry, and led the votaries to no other
shrine than that of Venus.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>The following ballad was once very popular; it is quoted
in Fletcher's <i>Knt. of the burning pestle</i>, act ii. sc. ult. and in
another old play, called, <i>Hans Beer-pot, his invisible Comedy,</i>
<i>&amp;c.</i> 4to. 1618; act i.&mdash;The copy below was communicated to the
Editor by the late Mr. Shenstone as corrected by him from an
ancient copy, and supplied with a concluding stanza.</p>

<p>We have placed this, and <i>Gentle Herdsman</i>, &amp;c. thus early in
the volume, upon a presumption that they must have been written,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>if not before the dissolution of the monasteries, yet while the remembrance
of them was fresh in the minds of the people.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Although Percy does not mention his folio MS. this song is there,
and a copy from it is now printed at the end of Percy's version.
With the exception of the last three lines there are little but verbal
differences, but these are numerous. The ending is strikingly inferior
to that of the MS. and does very little credit to Shenstone's
poetical taste. A copy of the song in the Bodleian library (MS.
Rawl. 85 fol. 124) is signed W. R., and Dr. Bliss in consequence
claimed it for Sir Walter Raleigh in his edition of Wood's <i>Athen&aelig;</i>.
It is inserted in the Oxford edition of Raleigh's Works, vol. viii.
p. 733, with the title&mdash;<i>False Love and True Love</i>. Dr. Hannah
also includes it in his edition of the <i>Courtly Poets</i>, but believes
it highly improbable that Raleigh wrote the song.</p>

<p>Mr. Chappell points out that the first line of the ballad quoted
above is introduced in Nashe's <i>Have with you to Saffron Walden</i>,
1596. In <i>The Weakest goes to the Wall</i>, 1600, we read</p></div>

HARDYKNUTE.</h3>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">A Scottish Fragment.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i105.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">As</span> this fine morsel of heroic poetry hath generally past for
ancient, it is here thrown to the end of our earliest
pieces; that such as doubt of its age, may the better
compare it with other pieces of genuine antiquity. For
after all, there is more than reason to suspect, that it owes most
of its beauties (if not its whole existence) to the pen of a lady,
within the present century. The following particulars may be
depended on. Mrs. Wardlaw, whose maiden name was Halket
(aunt to the late Sir Peter Halket, of Pitferran, in Scotland,
who was killed in America, along with general Bradock, in
1755), pretended she had found this poem, written on shreds of
paper, employed for what is called the bottoms of clues. A suspicion
arose that it was her own composition. Some able judges
asserted it to be modern. The lady did in a manner acknowledge
it to be so. Being desired to shew an additional stanza, as a proof
of this, she produced the 2 last beginning with "<i>There's nae light</i>,"
&amp;c. which were not in the copy that was first printed. The late
Lord President Forbes, and Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto (late Lord
Justice Clerk for Scotland) who had believed it ancient, contributed
to the expence of publishing the first edition, in folio, 1719.&mdash;This
account was transmitted from Scotland by Sir David Dalrymple,
the late Lord Hailes, who yet was of opinion, that part of
the ballad may be ancient; but retouched and much enlarged by
the lady abovementioned. Indeed he had been informed, that the
late William Thomson, the Scottish musician, who published the
<i>Orpheus Caledonius</i>, 1733, 2 vols. 8vo. declared he had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
fragments of it repeated in his infancy, before Mrs. Wardlaw's
copy was heard of.</p>

<p>The poem is here printed from the original edition, as it was
prepared for the press with the additional improvements.</p>

<p>In an elegant publication, intitled, <i>Scottish Tragic Ballads</i>,
printed by and for J. Nichols, 1781, 8vo. may be seen a continuation
of the Ballad of <i>Hardyknute</i>, by the addition of a <i>Second Part</i>,
which hath since been acknowledged to be his own composition,
by the ingenious Editor [John Pinkerton]&mdash;To whom the late Sir
D. Dalrymple communicated (subsequent to the account drawn up
above) extracts of a letter from Sir John Bruce, of Kinross, to Lord
Binning, which plainly proves the pretended discoverer of the fragment
of <i>Hardyknute</i> to have been Sir John Bruce himself. His
words are, "To perform my promise, I send you a true copy of
the Manuscript I found some weeks ago in a vault at Dumferline.
It is written on vellum in a fair Gothic character, but so much
defaced by time, as you'll find that the tenth part is not legible."
He then gives the whole fragment as it was first published in 1719,
save one or two stanzas, marking several passages as having
perished by being illegible in the old MS. Hence it appears,
that Sir John was the author of <i>Hardyknute</i>, but afterwards used
Mrs. Wardlaw to be the midwife of his poetry, and suppressed the
story of the vault; as is well observed by the Editor of the <i>Tragic</i>
<i>Ballads</i>, and of Maitland's <i>Scot. Poets</i>, vol. i. p. cxxvii.</p>

<p>To this gentleman we are indebted for the use of the copy,
whence the second edition was afterwards printed, as the same
was prepared for the press by John Clerk, M.D. of Edinburgh, an
intimate companion of Lord President Forbes.</p>

<p>The title of the first edition was, "<i>Hardyknute, a Fragment</i>.
Edinburgh, printed for James Watson, &amp;c. 1719," folio, 12 pages.</p>

<p>Stanzas not in the first edition are, Nos. 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23,
34, 35, 36, 37, 41, 42.</p>

<p>In the present impression the orthography of Dr. Clerk's copy
has been preserved, and his readings carefully followed, except in
a few instances, wherein the common edition appeared preferable:
<i>viz.</i> He had in ver. 20. <i>but.</i>&mdash;v. 56. <i>of harm.</i>&mdash;v. 64. <i>every.</i>&mdash;v. 67.
<i>lo down.</i>&mdash;v. 83. <i>That</i> omitted.&mdash;v. 89. <i>And</i> omitted.&mdash;v. 143. <i>With</i>
<i>argument but vainly strave Lang.</i>&mdash;v. 148. <i>say'd.</i>&mdash;v. 155. <i>incampit</i>
<i>on the plain.</i>&mdash;v. 156. <i>Norse squadrons.</i>&mdash;v. 158. <i>regand revers.</i>&mdash;v.
170. <i>his strides he bent.</i>&mdash;v. 171. <i>minstrals playand Pibrochs fine.</i>&mdash;v.
172. <i>stately went.</i>&mdash;v. 182. <i>mon.</i>&mdash;v. 196. <i>sharp and fatal.</i>&mdash;v.
219. <i>which.</i>&mdash;v. 241. <i>stood wyld.</i>&mdash;Stanza 39 preceded stanza
38.&mdash;v. 305. <i>There.</i>&mdash;v. 313. <i>blew westling.</i>&mdash;v. 336. had originally
been, <i>He fear'd a' cou'd be fear'd</i>.</p>

<p>The Editor was also informed, on the authority of Dr. David
Clerk, M.D. of Edinburgh (son of the aforesaid Dr. John Clerk),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that between the present stanzas 36 and 37, the two following had
been intended, but were on maturer consideration omitted, and do
not now appear among the MS. additions:</p>

<p>[Elizabeth Halket, second daughter of Sir Charles Halket of
Pitfirrane, Fife, and wife of Sir Henry Wardlaw of Pitrivie, Fife
and Balmulie near Dunfermline, who was born in the year 1677,
married in 1696, and died in 1727, is now known to have been
the authoress of <i>Hardyknute</i>, although it was many years before
the question of the authorship was finally settled.</p>

<p>Mr. David Laing once possessed a copy of this ballad printed
in a duodecimo of eight pages without date, which is supposed to
be the original edition. Besides various differences, some important
and others minute, it does not contain stanzas 27, 28 and
40, which are printed in the folio of 1719. It was reprinted several
times before Percy included it in his book, and its antiquity does
not seem to have been doubted, for the editor of the edition of
1740 speaks of it as a specimen of the true sublime, and believes
that "it can only be the work of an author highly smitten with
the fury of a poetical genius." Allan Ramsay's <i>Evergreen</i>, 1724,
vol. ii. contains this ballad with the twelve additional stanzas noted
above by Percy.</p>

<p>When Percy first printed the ballad suspicions of its authenticity
had been expressed, which soon led to the discovery of the writer, but
after having stated who was the real author, he threw doubts upon his
statement on account of Pinkerton's truthless report. Pinkerton was
never to be depended upon, and he had previously affirmed that
the common people of Lanarkshire "repeat scraps of <i>both parts</i>,"
although the second was his own composition. Sir John Hope Bruce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
had nothing to do with the composition of the ballad, and it is even
doubtful whether his supposed letter to Lord Binning ever had
any existence. If it had, it was merely a mystification. On the
second of December, 1785, Lord Hailes wrote to Pinkerton as
follows, "You mistook if you suppose that I reckoned Sir John
Bruce to be the author of <i>Hardyknute</i>. It is his sister-in-law, Lady
Wardlaw, who is said to have been the author." Yet Pinkerton
made Percy believe that Bruce was the author. Great difference
of opinion has been expressed as to the merit of the ballad by
various critics. Mathias was fascinated with it, and printed it
privately with an encomiastic criticism. Scott wrote on the fly-leaf
of his copy of Ramsay's <i>Evergreen</i>, "<i>Hardyknute</i> was the first
poem I ever learnt&mdash;the last that I shall forget," and in his <i>Minstrelsy</i>
<i>of the Border</i> he terms it "a most spirited and beautiful
imitation of the ancient ballad." Thomas Warton was deceived by
it, and describes it as genuine in the first edition of his <i>Observations</i>
<i>on Spenser</i>. In the second edition he assigns the ballad to its true
author, but adds, "I am apt to think that the first stanza is old
and gave the hint for writing the rest." On the other side Dr.
Johnson considered it to have "no great merit," and Aytoun
esteemed it a very poor performance. It has not been popular
with the ordinary devourers of ballads, and Mr. James Maidment
never had the good luck to pick up a stall copy&mdash;he writes, "The
flying stationers, the best judges of what suited their customers,
not considering it an eligible republication." The ballad is supposed
to refer to the battle of Largs, fought on the second of
October, 1263, between the invading force led by Haco, King
of Norway, and the Scottish army commanded in person by
Alexander III., but it would, in fact, suit any conflict between
Scots and Northmen. The effect of this battle was the loss to
Scandinavia of the Hebrides and the Isle of Man, which dependencies
were relinquished to Alexander III. by terms of a treaty
concluded in 1266, with Magnus, the successor of Haco. The
victory was largely due to the Lord High Steward of Scotland,
who is supposed to be represented by Hardyknute. Mr. Gilfillan
notes that "Fairly Castle, the residence of Hardyknute,
stands three miles south of the battle field. It is a single square
tower, by the side of a wild stream tumbling over a rock into a
deep ravine."]</p></div>

<h3>I.<br />

A BALLAD OF LUTHER, THE POPE, A
CARDINAL, AND A HUSBANDMAN.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i125i.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> the former Book we brought down this second Series
of poems, as low as about the middle of the sixteenth
century. We now find the Muses deeply engaged in
religious controversy. The sudden revolution, wrought
in the opinions of mankind by the Reformation, is one of the most
striking events in the history of the human mind. It could not
but engross the attention of every individual in that age, and
therefore no other writings would have any chance to be read, but
such as related to this grand topic. The alterations made in the
established religion by Henry VIII., the sudden changes it underwent
in the three succeeding reigns within so short a space as
eleven or twelve years, and the violent struggles between expiring
Popery, and growing Protestantism, could not but interest all mankind.
Accordingly every pen was engaged in the dispute. The
followers of the Old and New Profession (as they were called) had
their respective Ballad-makers; and every day produced some
popular sonnet for or against the Reformation. The following ballad,
and that intitled <i>Little John Nobody</i>, may serve for specimens of
the writings of each party. Both were written in the reign of Edward
VI.; and are not the worst that were composed upon the
occasion. Controversial divinity is no friend to poetic flights.
Yet this ballad of <i>Luther and the Pope</i> is not altogether devoid
of spirit; it is of the dramatic kind, and the characters are tolerably
well sustained; especially that of Luther, which is made to speak
in a manner not unbecoming the spirit and courage of that vigorous
Reformer. It is printed from the original black-letter copy (in the
Pepys collection, vol. i. folio,) to which is prefixed a large wooden
cut, designed and executed by some eminent master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>We are not to wonder that the ballad-writers of that age should
be inspired with the zeal of controversy, when the very stage
teemed with polemic divinity. I have now before me two very
ancient quarto black-letter plays: the one published in the time
of Henry VIII., intitled, <i>Every Man</i>; the other called <i>Lusty</i>
<i>Juventus</i>, printed in the reign of Edward VI. In the former of
these, occasion is taken to inculcate great reverence for old mother
church and her superstitions:<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> in the other, the poet (one <i>R. Wever</i>)
with great success attacks both. So that the Stage in those days
literally was, what wise men have always wished it, a supplement
to the pulpit:&mdash;This was so much the case, that in the play of
<i>Lusty Juventus</i>, chapter and verse are every where quoted as
formally as in a sermon; take an instance:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Lord by his prophet Ezechiel sayeth in this wise playnlye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in the xxxiij chapter it doth appere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be converted, O ye children, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From this play we learn that most of the young people were New
Gospellers, or friends to the Reformation; and that the old were
tenacious of the doctrines imbibed in their youth: for thus the
Devil is introduced lamenting the downfal of superstition:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The olde people would believe stil in my lawes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the yonger sort leade them a contrary way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wyl not beleve, they playnly say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In olde traditions, and made by men, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in another place Hypocrisy urges,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The worlde was never meri<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since chyldren were so boulde:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now every boy will be a teacher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father a foole, the chyld a preacher."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of the plays abovementioned, to the first is subjoined the following
Printer's Colophon, &para; Thus endeth this moral playe of Every Man,
&para; Imprynted at London in Powles chyrche yarde by me John
Skot. In Mr. Garrick's collection is an imperfect copy of the same
play, printed by Richarde Pynson.</p>

<p>The other is intitled, <i>An enterlude called Lusty Juventus</i>: and is
thus distinguished at the end: Finis. quod R. Wever. Imprinted
at London in Paules churche yeard, by Abraham Vele at the signe
of the Lambe. Of this too Mr. Garrick has an imperfect copy of a
different edition.</p>

<p>Of these two plays the reader may find some further particulars
in the former volume, Appendix II., see <i>The Essay on the Origin of</i>
<i>the English Stage</i>; and the curious reader will find the plays
themselves printed at large in Hawkins's <i>Origin of the English</i>
<i>Drama</i>, 3 vols. Oxford, 1773, 12mo.</p>

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i131.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">While</span> in England verse was made the vehicle of controversy,
and popery was attacked in it by logical
argument, or stinging satire; we may be sure the zeal
of the Scottish Reformers would not suffer their pens
to be idle, but many a pasquil was discharged at the Romish
priests, and their enormous encroachments on property. Of this
kind perhaps is the following, (preserved in Maitland's MS. Collection
of Scottish poems in the Pepysian library:)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tak a Wobster, that is leill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a Miller, that will not steill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ane Priest, that is not gredy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay ane deid corpse thame by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, throw virtue of thame three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That deid corpse sall qwyknit be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus far all was fair: but the furious hatred of popery led them
to employ their rhymes in a still more licentious manner. It is a
received tradition in Scotland, that at the time of the Reformation,
ridiculous and obscene songs were composed to be sung by the
rabble to the tunes of the most favourite hymns in the Latin service.
<i>Green sleeves and pudding pies</i> (designed to ridicule the
popish clergy) is said to have been one of these metamorphosed
hymns: <i>Maggy Lauder</i> was another: <i>John Anderson my jo</i> was a
third. The original music of all these burlesque sonnets was very
fine. To give a specimen of their manner, we have inserted one
of the least offensive. The reader will pardon the meanness of
the composition for the sake of the anecdote, which strongly marks
the spirit of the times.</p>

<p>In the present Edition this song is much improved by some

LITTLE JOHN NOBODY.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i133.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">We</span> have here a witty libel on the Reformation under
king Edward VI. written about the year 1550, and preserved
in the Pepys collection, British Museum, and
Strype's <i>Mem. of Cranmer</i>. The author artfully declines
entering into the merits of the cause, and wholly reflects on the lives
and actions of many of the Reformed. It is so easy to find flaws and
imperfections in the conduct of men, even the best of them, and
still easier to make general exclamations about the profligacy of
the present times, that no great point is gained by arguments
of that sort, unless the author could have proved that the principles
of the Reformed Religion had a natural tendency to produce
a corruption of manners: whereas he indirectly owns,
that their <i>reverend father</i> [archbishop Cranmer] had used the
most proper means to stem the torrent, by giving the people
access to the Scriptures, by teaching them to pray with understanding,
and by publishing homilies, and other religious tracts.
It must however be acknowledged, that our libeller had at that
time sufficient room for just satire. For under the banners of the
Reformed had enlisted themselves, many concealed papists, who
had private ends to gratify; many that were of no religion; many
greedy courtiers, who thirsted after the possessions of the church;
and many dissolute persons, who wanted to be exempt from all
ecclesiastical censures. And as these men were loudest of all
others in their cries for Reformation, so in effect, none obstructed
the regular progress of it so much, or by their vicious lives brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>vexation and shame more on the truly venerable and pious Reformers.</p>

<p>The reader will remark the fondness of our satirist for alliteration:
in this he was guilty of no affectation or singularity; his
versification is that of <i>Pierce Plowman's Visions</i>, in which a recurrence
of similar letters is essential: to this he has only superadded
rhyme, which in his time began to be the general practice. See
an <i>Essay</i> on this very peculiar kind of metre, in the appendix to
this Volume.</p>

THE HEIR OF LINNE.</h3>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> original of this ballad is found in the Editor's folio
MS., the breaches and defects in which rendered the
insertion of supplemental stanzas necessary. These, it
is hoped, the reader will pardon, as indeed the completion
of the story was suggested by a modern ballad on a similar
subject.</p>

<p>From the Scottish phrases here and there discernible in this
poem, it should seem to have been originally composed beyond
the Tweed.</p>

<p>The Heir of Linne appears not to have been a Lord of Parliament,
but a Laird, whose title went along with his estate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[In the folio MS. Percy wrote the following note: "This old
copy (tho' a very indifferent fragment) I thought deserving of
some attention. I have therefore bestowed an entire revisal of the
subject for my <i>Reliques</i>, &amp;c." In this revisal, the Bishop swelled
out the 125 lines of the original into the 216 of his own version.
It has, therefore, been necessary to print a copy of the original at
the end of the present ballad. The modern ballad referred to
above is the <i>Drunkard's Legacy</i>, printed in J. H. Dixon's <i>Ballads</i>
<i>of the Peasantry</i>, but it is only comparatively modern, as it dates
back to a period long before Percy's time. The portion which
Percy interpolated and took from this ballad, forms the end of the
first part and beginning of the second part of the following version.</p>

<p>The incident by which the hidden treasure is discovered occurs
in one of the stories of Cinthio's <i>Heccatomithi</i> (Dec. ix. Nov. 8),
but the arguments of the two tales are in other respects different.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
The Scotch claim this ballad as their own. Some suppose the
hero to have been an Ayrshire laird, and others that he was from
Galloway. Motherwell gives the following verses as the commencement
of the traditionary version extant in Scotland:</p></div>

GASCOIGNE'S PRAISE OF THE FAIR

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">George</span> Gascoigne was a celebrated poet in the early
part of Queen Elizabeth's reign, and appears to great
advantage among the miscellaneous writers of that age.
He was author of three or four plays, and of many
smaller poems; one of the most remarkable of which is a satire in
blank verse, called the <i>Steele-glass</i>, 1576, 4to.</p>

<p>Gascoigne was born in Essex, educated in both universities,
whence he removed to Gray's-inn; but, disliking the study of the
law, became first a dangler at court, and afterwards a soldier in
the wars of the Low Countries. He had no great success in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of these pursuits, as appears from a poem of his, intitled "Gascoigne's
Wodmanship, written to lord Gray of Wilton." Many of
his epistles dedicatory are dated in 1575, 1576, from "his poore
house in Walthamstoe:" where he died a middle-aged man in
1578, according to Anth. Wood: or rather in 1577, if he is the
person meant in an old tract, intitled, "A remembrance of the
well employed Life and godly End of Geo. Gascoigne, Esq.;
who deceased at Stamford in Lincolnshire, Oct. 7, 1577, by Geo.
Whetstone, Gent. an eye-witness of his godly and charitable end
in this world," 4to. no date. [From a MS. of Oldys.]</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Warton thinks "Gascoigne has much exceeded all
the poets of his age, in smoothness and harmony of versification."<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>
But the truth is, scarce any of the earlier poets of Q.
Elizabeth's time are found deficient in harmony and smoothness,
tho' those qualities appear so rare in the writings of their successors.
In the <i>Paradise of Dainty Devises</i>,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> (the <i>Dodsley's Miscellany</i>
of those times) will hardly be found one rough, or
inharmonious line:<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> whereas the numbers of Jonson, Donne, and
most of their contemporaries, frequently offend the ear like the
filing of a saw. Perhaps this is in some measure to be accounted
for from the growing pedantry of that age, and from the writers
affecting to run their lines into one another, after the manner of
the Latin and Greek poets.</p>

<p>The following poem (which the elegant writer above quoted
hath recommended to notice, as possessed of a delicacy rarely to
be seen in that early state of our poetry) properly consists of
Alexandrines of twelve and fourteen syllables, and is printed from
two quarto black-letter collections of Gascoigne's pieces; the first
intitled, "A hundreth sundrie flowres, bounde up in one small
posie, &amp;c. London, imprinted for Richarde Smith:" without date,
but from a letter of H. W. (p. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>), compared with the printer's
epist. to the reader, it appears to have been published in 1572, or
3. The other is intitled, "The Posies of George Gascoigne,
Esq.; corrected, perfected, and augmented by the author; 1575.&mdash;Printed
at Lond. for Richard Smith, &amp;c." No year, but the
epist. dedicat. is dated 1576.</p>

<p>In the title-page of this last (by way of printer's,<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> or bookseller's
device) is an ornamental wooden cut, tolerably well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>executed, wherein Time is represented drawing the figure of
Truth out of a pit or cavern, with this legend, <i>Occulta veritas</i>
<i>tempore patet</i> [<span class="smcap">R. S.</span>] This is mentioned because it is not improbable
but the accidental sight of this or some other title-page
containing the same device, suggested to Rubens that well-known
design of a similar kind, which he has introduced into the Luxemburg
gallery,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> and which has been so justly censured for the
unnatural manner of its execution.</p>

FAIR ROSAMOND.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i154.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Most</span> of the circumstances in this popular story of king
Henry II. and the beautiful Rosamond have been
taken for fact by our English historians; who, unable to
account for the unnatural conduct of queen Eleanor in
stimulating her sons to rebellion, have attributed it to jealousy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>and supposed that Henry's amour with Rosamond was the object
of that passion.</p>

<p>Our old English annalists seem, most of them, to have followed
Higden the monk of Chester, whose account, with some enlargements,
is thus given by Stow:&mdash;"Rosamond the fayre daughter of
Walter lord Clifford, concubine to Henry II. (poisoned by queen
Elianor, as some thought) dyed at Woodstocke [<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1177] where
king Henry had made for her a house of wonderfull working; so
that no man or woman might come to her, but he that was instructed
by the king, or such as were right secret with him
touching the matter. This house after some was named Labyrinthus,
or Dedalus worke, which was wrought like unto a knot in
a garden, called a maze;<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> but it was commonly said, that lastly
the queene came to her by a clue of thridde, or silke, and so dealt
with her, that she lived not long after: but when she was dead,
she was buried at Godstow in an house of nunnes, beside Oxford,
with these verses upon her tombe:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hic jacet in tumba, Rosa mundi, non Rosa munda:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Non redolet, sed olet, qu&aelig; redolere solet.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"In English thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The rose of the world, but not the cleane flowre,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is now here graven; to whom beauty was lent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this grave full darke nowe is her bowre,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That by her life was sweete and redolent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now that she is from this life blent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though she were sweete, now foully doth she stinke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mirrour good for all men, that on her thinke.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11em;"><span class="smcap">Stowe's</span> <i>Annals</i>, ed. 1631, p. 154.</span><br />
</p>

<p>How the queen gained admittance into Rosamond's bower is
differently related. Hollinshed speaks of it, as "the common
report of the people, that the queene ... founde hir out by a
silken thread, which the king had drawne after him out of hir
chamber with his foot, and dealt with hir in such sharpe and
cruell wise, that she lived not long after." Vol. iii. p. 115. On
the other hand, in Speede's <i>Hist.</i> we are told that the jealous
queen found her out "by a clew of silke, fallen from Rosamund's
lappe, as shee sate to take ayre, and suddenly fleeing from the
sight of the searcher, the end of her silke fastened to her foot, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>the clew still unwinding, remained behinde: which the queene
followed, till she had found what she sought, and upon Rosamund
so vented her spleene, as the lady lived not long after." 3rd edit.
p. 509. Our ballad-maker with more ingenuity, and probably as
much truth, tells us the clue was gained by surprise, from the
knight who was left to guard her bower.</p>

<p>It is observable, that none of the old writers attribute Rosamond's
death to poison (Stow, above, mentions it merely as a
slight conjecture); they only give us to understand, that the queen
treated her harshly; with furious menaces, we may suppose, and
sharp expostulations, which had such effect on her spirits, that she
did not long survive it. Indeed on her tomb-stone, as we learn
from a person of credit,<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> among other fine sculptures, was engraven
the figure of a cup. This, which perhaps at first was an
accidental ornament (perhaps only the chalice) might in after
times suggest the notion that she was poisoned; at least this construction
was put upon it, when the stone came to be demolished
after the nunnery was dissolved. The account is, that "the tomb-stone
of Rosamund Clifford was taken up at Godstow, and broken
in pieces, and that upon it were interchangeable weavings drawn
out and decked with roses red and green, and the picture of the
<i>cup</i>, out of which she drank the poison given her by the queen,
carved in stone."</p>

<p>Rosamond's father having been a great benefactor to the nunnery
of Godstow, where she had also resided herself in the innocent
part of her life, her body was conveyed there, and buried in the
middle of the choir; in which place it remained till the year
1191, when Hugh bishop of Lincoln caused it to be removed.
The fact is recorded by Hoveden, a contemporary writer, whose
words are thus translated by Stow: "Hugh bishop of Lincolne
came to the abbey of nunnes, called Godstow, ... and when
he had entred the church to pray, he saw a tombe in the middle
of the quire, covered with a pall of silke, and set about with lights
of waxe: and demanding whose tomb it was, he was answered,
that it was the tombe of Rosamond, that was some time lemman
to Henry II.... who for the love of her had done much good
to that church. Then quoth the bishop, take out of this place the
harlot, and bury her without the church, lest christian religion
should grow in contempt, and to the end that, through example of
her, other women being made afraid may beware, and keepe
themselves from unlawfull and advouterous company with men."&mdash;<i>Annals</i>,
p. 159.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p>History further informs us, that king John repaired Godstow
nunnery, and endowed it with yearly revenues, "that these holy
virgins might releeve with their prayers, the soules of his father
king Henrie, and of lady Rosamund there interred."<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> ... In
what situation her remains were found at the dissolution of the
nunnery, we learn from Leland: "Rosamundes tumbe at Godstowe
nunnery was taken up [of] late; it is a stone with this inscription,
<span class="smcap">Tumba Rosamund&aelig;</span>. Her bones were closid in lede,
and withyn that bones were closyd yn lether. When it was
opened a very swete smell came owt of it."<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> See Hearne's discourse
above quoted, written in 1718; at which time he tells us,
were still seen by the pool at Woodstock the foundations of a very
large building, which were believed to be the remains of Rosamond's
labyrinth.</p>

<p>To conclude this (perhaps too prolix) account, Henry had two
sons by Rosamond, from a computation of whose age, a modern
historian has endeavoured to invalidate the received story. These
were William Longue-esp&eacute; (or Long-sword), earl of Salisbury, and
Geoffrey, bishop of Lincolne.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Geoffrey was the younger of
Rosamond's sons, and yet is said to have been twenty years old at
the time of his election to that see in 1173. Hence this writer
concludes, that king Henry fell in love with Rosamond in 1149,
when in king Stephen's reign he came over to be knighted by the
king of Scots; he also thinks it probable that Henry's commerce
with this lady "broke off upon his marriage with Eleanor (in
1152) and that the young lady, by a natural effect of grief and
resentment at the defection of her lover, entered on that occasion
into the nunnery of Godstowe, where she died probably before the
rebellion of Henry's sons in 1173." (Carte's <i>Hist.</i> vol. i. p. 652.)
But let it be observed, that Henry was but sixteen years old when
he came over to be knighted; that he staid but eight months in
this island, and was almost all the time with the king of Scots;
that he did not return back to England till 1153, the year after his
marriage with Eleanor; and that no writer drops the least hint of
Rosamond's having ever been abroad with her lover, nor indeed is
it probable that a boy of sixteen should venture to carry over a
mistress to his mother's court. If all these circumstances are
considered, Mr. Carte's account will be found more incoherent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>and improbable than that of the old ballad; which is also countenanced
by most of our old historians.</p>

<p>Indeed the true date of Geoffrey's birth, and consequently of
Henry's commerce with Rosamond, seems to be best ascertained
from an ancient manuscript in the Cotton library: wherein it is
thus registered of Geoffrey Plantagenet: "Natus est 5&deg; Hen. II.
[1159.] Factus est miles 25&deg; Hen. II. [1179.] Elect. in
Episcop. Lincoln. 28&deg; Hen. II. [1182.]" Vid. <i>Chron. de Kirkstall</i>
(Domitian XII.) Drake's <i>Hist. of York</i>, p. 422.</p>

<p>The ballad of <i>Fair Rosamond</i> appears to have been first published
in "Strange Histories, or Songs and Sonnets, of Kinges,
Princes, Dukes, Lords, Ladyes, Knights, and Gentlemen, &amp;c. By
Thomas Delone. Lond. 1607." 12mo.</p>

<p>It is here printed (with conjectural emendations), from four
ancient copies in black-letter; two of them in the Pepys library.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[It is also printed in the <i>Crown Garland of Golden Roses, and</i>
<i>Garland of Goodwill</i>. Reprinted by the Percy Society.</p>

<p>In the <i>Collection of Old Ballads</i>, 1723, vol. i. p. 1, is another
ballad on the same subject, with the title, <i>The Unfortunate Concubine,</i>
<i>or Rosamond's Overthrow</i>.</p>

<p>The story is also treated in Warner's <i>Albion's England</i>
(ch. 41).]</p></div>

QUEEN ELEANOR'S CONFESSI&Oacute;N.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i164.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">"Eleanor</span>, the daughter and heiress of William duke of
Guienne, and count of Poictou, had been married sixteen
years to Louis VII. king of France, and had
attended him in a croisade, which that monarch commanded
against the infidels; but having lost the affections of her
husband, and even fallen under some suspicions of gallantry with
a handsome Saracen, Louis, more delicate than politic, procured a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
divorce from her, and restored her those rich provinces, which by
her marriage she had annexed to the crown of France. The
young count of Anjou, afterwards Henry II. king of England,
tho' at that time but in his nineteenth year, neither discouraged
by the disparity of age, nor by the reports of Eleanor's gallantry,
made such successful courtship to that princess, that he married
her six weeks after her divorce, and got possession of all her
dominions as a dowery. A marriage thus founded upon interest
was not likely to be very happy: it happened accordingly,
Eleanor, who had disgusted her first husband by her gallantries,
was no less offensive to her second by her jealousy: thus carrying
to extremity, in the different parts of her life, every circumstance
of female weakness. She had several sons by Henry, whom she
spirited up to rebel against him; and endeavouring to escape to
them disguised in man's apparel in 1173, she was discovered and
thrown into a confinement, which seems to have continued till the
death of her husband in 1189. She however survived him many
years: dying in 1204, in the sixth year of the reign of her youngest
son, John." See Hume's <i>Hist.</i> 4to. vol. i. pp. 260, 307. Speed,
Stow, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is needless to observe, that the following ballad (given, with
some corrections, from an old printed copy) is altogether fabulous;
whatever gallantries Eleanor encouraged in the time of her first
husband, none are imputed to her in that of her second.</p>

<p>[The idea of the unlucky shrift exhibited in the following ballad
is taken from some old story-teller. It occurs among the tales of
Boccaccio, Bandello, Barbazan, La Fontaine, and several other
writers.</p>

<p>A copy of this ballad, differing very considerably from the present
version, is to be found in Kinloch's <i>Ancient Scottish Ballads</i>.
The first stanza is as follows:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The queen fell sick, and very, very sick<br /></span>

THE BEGGAR'S DAUGHTER OF
BEDNALL-GREEN.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i171.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> popular old ballad was written in the reign of
Elizabeth, as appears not only from ver. 23, where the
arms of England are called the "Queenes armes;" but
from its tune's being quoted in other old pieces,
written in her time. See the ballad on <i>Mary Ambree</i> in this
volume. The late Mr. Guthrie assured the editor that he had
formerly seen another old song on the same subject, composed in
a different measure from this; which was truly beautiful, if we
may judge from the only stanza he remembered. In this it was
said of the old beggar, that "down his neck</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;his reverend lockes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In comelye curles did wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his aged temples grewe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The blossomes of the grave."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following ballad is chiefly given from the Editor's folio MS.
compared with two ancient printed copies: the concluding stanzas,
which contain the old beggar's discovery of himself, are not however
given from any of these, being very different from those of
the vulgar ballad. Nor yet does the Editor offer them as genuine,
but as a modern attempt to remove the absurdities and inconsistencies,
which so remarkably prevailed in this part of the song,
as it stood before: whereas by the alteration of a few lines, the
story is rendered much more affecting, and is reconciled to probability
and true history. For this informs us, that at the decisive
battle of Evesham (fought Aug. 4, 1265), when Simon de Montfort,
the great Earl of Leicester, was slain at the head of the
barons, his eldest son Henry fell by his side, and in consequence
of that defeat, his whole family sunk for ever, the king bestowing
their great honours and possessions on his second son, Edmund
earl of Lancaster.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This charming old ballad has enjoyed a long life of popularity,
and according to Mr. Chappell it is still kept in print in Seven
Dials, and sung about the country. As it is to be found in most
collections, it has not been thought necessary to take note of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
various trifling alterations which Percy made, but the six stanzas
which he ejected in favour of the eight between brackets are
printed at the end. A few of the alterations are improvements,
but most of them are the reverse; thus, in place of the received
reading of verse 28,</p></div>

<p>Mr. John Pickford (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 4th Series, vol. ix.
p. 64) once possessed an old mezzotint engraving of the Blind
Beggar of a large folio size, on the margin of which were inscribed
the lines referred to above. In Robert Greene's <i>Pandosto</i> (1588),
from which Shakspere drew the plot of his <i>Winter's Tale</i>, there is
the same simile as is used in these verses. Egistus says:&mdash;"Thou
seest my white hayres are blossomes for the grave."</p>

<p>Pepys in his Diary (25th June, 1663), speaks of going to
dinner with Sir William and Lady Batten and Sir J. Minnes to Sir
William Ryder's at Bethnall Green, and adds: "This very house
was built by the blind beggar of Bednall Green, so much talked of
and sang in ballads, but they say it was only some outhouse of it."
The mansion was built by John Kirby, a citizen of London, in the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, and afterwards became the residence of
Sir Hugh Platt, author of <i>The Jewell House of Art and Nature</i>,
1594; <i>The Garden of Eden</i>, &amp;c. Ryder died there in 1669.]</p></div>

<p>&dagger;&Dagger;&dagger; The word <i>fit</i> for <i>part</i>, often occurs in our ancient ballads
and metrical romances: which being divided into several parts for
the convenience of singing them at public entertainments, were in
the intervals of the feast sung by fits, or intermissions. So Puttenham
in his <i>Art of English Poesie</i>, 1589, says: "the Epithalamie
was divided by breaches into three partes to serve for three several
fits, or times to be sung." P. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>.</p>

<p>From the same writer we learn some curious particulars relative
to the state of ballad-singing in that age, that will throw light on
the present subject: speaking of the quick returns of one manner
of tune in the short measures used by common rhymers; these, he
says, "glut the eare, unless it be in small and popular musickes,
sung by these Cantabanqui, upon benches and barrels heads,
where they have none other audience then boys or countrey
fellowes, that passe by them in the streete; or else by <i>blind</i>
<i>harpers</i>, or such like taverne minstrels, that give a <i>fit</i> of mirth for
a <i>groat</i>, ... their matter being for the most part stories of old
time, as the tale of <i>Sir Topas</i>, the reportes of <i>Bevis of Southampton</i>,
<i>Guy of Warwicke</i>, <i>Adam Bell and Clymme of the Clough</i>, and
such other old romances or historical rimes, made purposely for
recreation of the common people at Christmasse dinners and
brideales, and in tavernes and alehouses, and such other places of
base resorte." P. <a href="#Page_69">69</a>.</p>

<p>This species of entertainment, which seems to have been
handed down from the ancient bards, was in the time of Puttenham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>falling into neglect; but that it was not, even then, wholly excluded
from more genteel assemblies, he gives us room to infer from
another passage: "We ourselves," says this courtly<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> writer, "have
written for pleasure a little brief romance, or historical ditty in
the English tong of the <i>Isle of Great Britaine</i> in short and long
meetres, and by breaches or divisions (<i>i.e.</i> fits), to be more commodiously
sung to the harpe in places of assembly, where the company
shal be desirous to heare of old adventures, and valiaunces
of noble knights in times past, as are those of <i>King Arthur and</i>
<i>his Knights of the Round Table</i>, <i>Sir Bevys of Southampton</i>, <i>Guy</i>
<i>of Warwicke</i>, and others like." P. <a href="#Page_33">33</a>.</p>

<p>In more ancient times no grand scene of festivity was compleat
without one of these reciters to entertain the company with feats
of arms, and tales of knighthood, or, as one of these old minstrels
says, in the beginning of an ancient romance on <i>Guy and Colbronde</i>,
in the Editor's folio MS. p. <a href="#Page_349">349</a> [ed. Hales and Furnivall,
vol. ii., p. 527]:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>If we consider that a <i>groat</i> in the age of Elizabeth was more
than equivalent to a shilling now, we shall find that the old
harpers were even then, when their art was on the decline, upon a
far more reputable footing than the ballad-singers of our time.
The reciting of one such ballad as this of the <i>Beggar of Bednal</i>
<i>Green</i>, in two parts, was rewarded with half-a-crown of our
money. And that they made a very respectable appearance, we
may learn from the dress of the old beggar, in the preceding
ballad, p. <a href="#Page_178">178</a>, where he comes into company in the habit and
character of one of these minstrels, being not known to be the
bride's father till after her speech, ver. 63. The exordium of his
song, and his claiming a groat for his reward, v. 76, are peculiarly
characteristic of that profession. Most of the old ballads begin
in a pompous manner, in order to captivate the attention of the
audience, and induce them to purchase a recital of the song: and
they seldom conclude the first part without large promises of still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>greater entertainment in the second. This was a necessary piece
of art to incline the hearers to be at the expense of a second
groat's-worth. Many of the old romances extend to eight or nine
fits, which would afford a considerable profit to the reciter.</p>

<p>To return to the word <i>fit</i>; it seems at one time to have
peculiarly signified the pause, or breathing-time, between the
several parts (answering to Passus in the <i>Visions of Pierce Plowman</i>):
thus in the ancient ballad of <i>Chevy-Chase</i> (vol. i. p. 27), the
first part ends with this line:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The first <i>fit</i> here I fynde:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>i.e.</i> here I come to the first pause or intermission. (See also vol. i.
p. 44.) By degrees it came to signify the whole part or division
preceding the pause. (See vol. i. pp. 162, 169.) This sense it
had obtained so early as the time of Chaucer; who thus concludes
the first part of his rhyme of <i>Sir Thopas</i> (writ in ridicule of the
old ballad romances):&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lo! lordis mine, here is a <i>fitt</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye woll any more of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To tell it woll I fonde."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The word <i>fit</i> indeed appears originally to have signified a poetic
strain, verse, or poem; for in these senses it is used by the Anglo-Saxon
writers. Thus K. &AElig;lfred in his <i>Boethius</i>, having given a
version of lib. 3, metr. 5, adds, &ETH;a &#xA785;e p&iota;&#xA785;&#xA77A;om &thorn;a &thorn;a&#xA785; &#xA77C;&iota;&#xA787;&#xA787;e
a&#xA785;un&#541;en h&aelig;&#xA77C;&#xA77A;e, p. <a href="#Page_65">65</a>, <i>i.e.</i> "When wisdom had sung these (Fitts)
verses." And in the proem to the same book, Fon on &#xA77C;&iota;&#xA787;&#xA787;e, "Put
into (fitt) verse." So in Cedmon, p. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>. Feon&#xA77A; on &#xA77C;&iota;&#xA787;&#xA787;e, seems
to mean "composed a song," or "poem." The reader will trace
this old Saxon phrase, in the application of the word <i>fond</i>, in the
foregoing passage of Chaucer.</p>

<p>Spencer has used the word fit to denote "a strain of music;"
see his poem, intitled, <i>Collin Clout's come home again</i>, where he
says:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Shepherd of the ocean [Sir Walt. Raleigh]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provoked me to play some pleasant <i>fit</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And when he heard the music which I made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He found himself full greatlye pleas'd at it," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is also used in the old ballad of <i>K. Estmere</i>, vol. i. book 1,
No. 6, v. 243.</p>

<p>From being applied to music, this word was easily transferred to
dancing; thus in the old play of <i>Lusty Juventus</i> (described in preliminary
note to book 2, No. 1 in this volume), Juventus says:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By the masse I would fayne go daunce a <i>fitte</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>And from being used as a part or division in a ballad, poem, &amp;c.
it is applied by Bale to a section or chapter in a book (though I
believe in a sense of ridicule or sarcasm), for thus he intitles two
chapters of his <i>English Votaryes</i>, part 2nd, viz. fol. 49, "The fyrst
<i>fytt</i> of Anselme with Kynge Wyllyam Rufus;" fol. 50, "An other
<i>Fytt</i> of Anselme with kynge Wyllyam Rufus."</p></div>

FANCY AND DESIRE.</h3>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">By the Earl of Oxford.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i185.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Edward</span> Vere, Earl of Oxford, was in high fame for
his poetical talents in the reign of Elizabeth; perhaps
it is no injury to his reputation that few of his compositions
are preserved for the inspection of impartial
posterity. To gratify curiosity, we have inserted a sonnet of his,
which is quoted with great encomiums for its "excellencie and
wit," in Puttenham's <i>Arte of Eng. Poesie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> and found intire in the
<i>Garland of Good-will</i>. A few more of his sonnets (distinguished
by the initial letters E. O.), may be seen in the <i>Paradise of Daintie</i>
<i>Devises</i>. One of these is intitled <i>The Complaint of a Lover,</i>
<i>wearing blacke and tawnie</i>. The only lines in it worth notice are
these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A crowne of baies shall that man 'beare'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who triumphs over me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For black and tawnie will I weare,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which mourning colours be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We find in Hall's <i>Chronicle</i>, that when Q. Catharine of Arragon
dyed, Jan. 8, 1536, "Queen Anne (Bullen) ware <i>yellowe</i> for the
mourning." And when this unfortunate princess lost her head,
May 19, the same year, "on the ascencion day following, the kyng
for mourning ware <i>whyte</i>." Fol. 227, 228.</p>

<p>Edward, who was the seventeenth earl of Oxford, of the family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>of Vere, succeeded his father in his title and honours in 1563, and
died an aged man in 1604. See Mr. Walpole's <i>Noble Authors</i>.
Athen. Oxon, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Walpole was in error when he stated that Lord Oxford died an
aged man, for that nobleman was only about sixty at the time of
his death. Sir Egerton Brydges points out in his edition of the
<i>Paradise of Dainty Devices</i> (<i>British Bibliographer</i>, vol. iii.), that
the earl could not have been born earlier than 1540 or 1541,
because his elder half-sister Katherine, widow of Edward, Lord
Windsor, died in January, 1599, aged 60. The chief events of his
life are these. In 1585 he was the chief of those who embarked
with the Earl of Leicester for the relief of the states of Holland
and Zealand. In 1586 he sat as Lord Great Chamberlain of England
on the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1588 he hired and
fitted out ships at his own charge against the Spanish Armada. In
1589 he sat on the trial of Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, and
in 1601 on the trials of the Earls of Essex and Southampton.
His private character was far from good, and his honour was tarnished
by his dispute with Sir Philip Sidney. He used his first
wife (a daughter of the great Burleigh) cruelly, in revenge for the
statesman's treatment of his great friend, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.
In his early youth he travelled in Italy, and returned from
that country a finished coxcomb, bringing home with him Italian
dresses, perfumes, and embroidered gloves. He presented a pair
of the latter to Queen Elizabeth, who was so pleased with them
that she was drawn with them on her hands. The earl was buried
at Hackney, on the 6th of July, 1604.</p>

<p>Percy might have spared rather more praise for this pretty little
poem.]</p></div>

SIR ANDREW BARTON.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i188.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">I </span>cannot give a better relation of the fact which is
the subject of the following ballad, than in an extract
from the late Mr. Guthrie's <i>Peerage</i>,<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> which was begun
upon a very elegant plan, but never finished. Vol. i.
4to. p. 22.</p>

<p>"The transaction which did the greatest honour to the earl of
Surrey<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> and his family at this time (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1511), was their behaviour
in the case of Barton, a Scotch sea-officer. This gentleman's
father having suffered by sea from the Portuguese, he had obtained
letters of marque for his two sons to make reprisals upon the subjects
of Portugal. It is extremely probable, that the court of
Scotland granted these letters with no very honest intention. The
council board of England, at which the earl of Surrey held the
chief place, was daily pestered with complaints from the sailors
and merchants, that Barton, who was called Sir Andrew Barton,
under pretence of searching for Portuguese goods, interrupted the
English navigation. Henry's situation at that time rendered him
backward from breaking with Scotland, so that their complaints
were but coldly received. The earl of Surrey, however, could not
smother his indignation, but gallantly declared at the council
board, that while he had an estate that could furnish out a ship,
or a son that was capable of commanding one, the narrow seas
should not be infested.</p>

<p>"Sir Andrew Barton, who commanded the two Scotch ships,
had the reputation of being one of the ablest sea officers of his
time. By his depredations, he had amassed great wealth, and his
ships were very richly laden. Henry, notwithstanding his situation,
could not refuse the generous offer made by the earl of
Surrey. Two ships were immediately fitted out, and put to sea
with letters of marque, under his two sons, Sir Thomas<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> and Sir
Edward Howard. After encountering a great deal of foul weather,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>Sir Thomas came up with the 'Lion,' which was commanded by
Sir Andrew Barton in person; and Sir Edward came up with the
'Union,' Barton's other ship (called by Hall, the 'Bark of Scotland.')
The engagement which ensued was extremely obstinate
on both sides; but at last the fortune of the Howards prevailed.
Sir Andrew was killed fighting bravely, and encouraging his men
with his whistle, to hold out to the last; and the two Scotch ships
with their crews, were carried into the river Thames. (Aug. 2,
1511.)</p>

<p>"This exploit had the more merit, as the two English commanders
were in a manner volunteers in the service, by their
father's order. But it seems to have laid the foundation of Sir
Edward's fortune; for, on the 7th of April, 1512, the king constituted
him (according to Dugdale) admiral of England,
Wales, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"King James 'insisted' upon satisfaction for the death of
Barton, and capture of his ship: tho' Henry had generously dismissed
the crews, and even agreed that the parties accused might
appear in his courts of admiralty by their attornies, to vindicate
themselves." This affair was in a great measure the cause of the
battle of Flodden, in which James IV. lost his life.</p>

<p>In the following ballad will be found perhaps some few deviations
from the truth of history; to atone for which it has probably
recorded many lesser facts, which history hath not condescended
to relate. I take many of the little circumstances of the story to
be real, because I find one of the most unlikely to be not very
remote from the truth. In pt. 2, v. 156, it is said, that England
had before "but two ships of war." Now the "Great Harry" had
been built only seven years before, viz. in 1504: which "was
properly speaking the first ship in the English navy. Before this
period, when the prince wanted a fleet, he had no other expedient
but hiring ships from the merchants."&mdash;Hume.</p>

<p>This ballad, which appears to have been written in the reign of
Elizabeth, has received great improvements from the Editor's folio
MS. wherein was an ancient copy, which, though very incorrect,
seemed in many respects superior to the common ballad; the
latter being evidently modernized and abridged from it. The
following text is, however, in some places amended and improved
by the latter (chiefly from a black-letter copy in the Pepys collection),
as also by conjecture.</p>

<p>[There is little to be added to the above preface, but those who
wish to read the Scottish version will find John Lesley's (Bishop
of Ross) account of the affair (<i>Historie of Scotland</i>, 1436-1561),
quoted in Mr. Furnivall's full preface to the ballad in the folio MS.
(vol. iii. p. 399). Percy fully explains how he made up his copy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
There is, in fact, hardly a line that has not been altered, and the
notes at the foot of the page give the reader no idea of the
changes that have been made. To have noted all the differences
would have loaded the page unnecessarily, and therefore in consideration
of the interest of the ballad, a reprint of the folio copy
has been added, although there are several printed copies. It is
difficult to understand what could have induced Percy to reject
the pretty lines:</p></div>

was brought to its present perfection, some naval commanders
had recourse to instruments or machines, similar in use, though
perhaps unlike in construction, to the heavy dolphins made of
lead or iron used by the ancient Greeks; which they suspended
from beams or yards fastened to the masts, and which they precipitately
let fall on the enemies ships, in order to sink them, by
beating holes through the bottoms of their undecked triremes, or
otherwise damaging them. These are mentioned by Thucydides,
lib. vii. p. 256, ed. 1564, folio, and are more fully explained in

LADY ANNE BOTHWELL'S LAMENT.</h3>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">A Scottish Song.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i209.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of this pathetic ballad the Editor once
thought might possibly relate to the Earl of Bothwell,
and his desertion of his wife Lady Jean Gordon, to
make room for his marriage with the Queen of Scots.</p>

<p>But this opinion he now believes to be groundless; indeed Earl
Bothwell's age, who was upwards of 60 at the time of that marriage,
renders it unlikely that he should be the object of so warm
a passion as this elegy supposes. He has been since informed,
that it entirely refers to a private story: A young lady of the name
of <i>Bothwell</i>, or rather <i>Boswell</i>, having been, together with her child,
deserted by her husband or lover, composed these affecting lines
herself; which here are given from a copy in the Editor's folio MS.
corrected by another in Allan Ramsay's <i>Miscellany</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The young lady alluded to above has since been set aside for
the Hon. Anne Bothwell, daughter of Adam Bothwell, Bishop of
Orkney. Mr. James Maidment, in his elegant edition of <i>Scottish</i>
<i>Ballads and Songs</i> (vol. ii. 1868), writes: "The late Charles
Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esquire, whose knowledge of antiquated scandal
was extraordinary, found in a MS. history of the family of Bothwell
by Father Hay, that Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney, had a
daughter named 'Anne, who fell with child to a son of the Earl
of Marre.'" Anne was the sister of the first Lord Holyroodhouse
(created in 1607), and her seducer was Alexander, third son of
John, seventh Earl of Mar, a cousin of her own, considered one of
the handsomest men of his day. This is all very well for conjecture,
but it is nothing more. The ballad does not appear to
have been associated with a Bothwell, or in fact with any named
person, until more than a century after it was written. In the
Folio MS. it is simply called <i>Balowe</i>, and Percy therefore might
well have hesitated before he gave it the heading he has, and before
he Scotticised all the English words. The four earliest versions
are in the following books: 1. Richard Brome's Comedy of the
<i>Northern Lass, or the Nest of Fools</i>, printed in 1632, but acted
somewhat earlier; 2. Percy Folio; 3. Pinkerton's MS. (1625-49),
in the possession of David Laing; 4. John Gamble's MS., 1649;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
5. Elizabeth Rogers' MS., 1658. Mr. Chappell drew up the
following very valuable note for the edition of the Percy Folio
(vol. iii. p. 518), which puts the matter very clearly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Baloo is a sixteenth-century ballad, not a seventeenth. It is
alluded to by several of our early dramatists, and the tune is to be
found in an early Elizabethan MS. known as William Ballet's Lute
Book, as well as in Morley's <i>Consort Lessons</i>, printed in 1599.
The words and tune are together in John Gamble's Music
Book, a MS. in the possession of Dr. Rimbault, (date 1649,)
and in Elizabeth Rogers's Virginal Book, in the library of the
British Museum (Addit. MS. 10,337). The last is dated 1658,
but the copy may have been taken some few years after. Baloo
was so popular a subject that it was printed as a street ballad,
with additional stanzas, just as 'My lodging it is on the cold
ground' and other popular songs were lengthened for the same
purpose. It has been reprinted in that form by Evans, in his <i>Old</i>
<i>Ballads, Historical and Narrative</i>, edit. 1810, vol. i. p. 259. The
title is 'The New Balow; or A Wenches Lamentation for the loss
of her Sweetheart: he having left her a babe to play with, being
the fruits of her folly.' The particular honour of having been the
'wench' in question was first claimed for 'Lady Anne Bothwell'
in Part iii. of <i>Comic and Serious Scots Poems</i>, published by
Watson in Edinburgh in 1711. Since that date Scotch antiquaries
have been very busy in searching into the scandalous history of the
Bothwell family, to find out which of the Lady Annes might have
been halla-balooing.</p>

<p>"May we not release the whole race from this imputation?
The sole authority for the charge is Watson's <i>Collection</i>! the
same book that ascribes to the unfortunate Montrose the song of
'My dear and only love, take heed,' and tacks it as a second part
to his 'My dear and only love, I pray.' Shade of Montrose! how
must you be ashamed of your over-zealous advocate! Let us
examine whether the spirit of 'Lady Anne Bothwel' has more
reason to be grateful. Among the stanzas ascribed to her by
Watson are the two following, which are not to be found in any
English copy:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I take my fate from best to worse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I must needs now be a nurse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lull my young son in my lap.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From me, sweet orphan, take the pap:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balow, my boy, thy mother mild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall sing, as from all bliss exil'd.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the second we find the inducement supposed to have been
offered by Lady Anne's lover:</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I was too credulous at the first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grant thee that a maiden durst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in thy bravery thou didst vaunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I no maintenance should want:(!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou swear thou lov'd, thy mind is moved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which since no otherwise has proved.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Comment is unnecessary. Can any one believe that such
lines were written by or for any lady of rank? Yet they were
copied as Lady Anne's by Allan Ramsay, and polished in his
usual style. They have been polished and repolished by subsequent
editors, but to little avail, for they remain great blots upon
a good English ballad. There is not a Scotch word, nor even one
peculiar to the North of England, in the whole of Watson's version."</p>

<p>This attempt to dispute the Scottish origin of the ballad is
strongly resented by the editor of the <i>Ballad Minstrelsy of Scotland</i>,
Glasgow, 1871. At all events the fact remains that the title
"Lady Anne Bothwell's Balow" cannot be traced farther back
than Watson's <i>Collection</i>, published in 1711.]</p></div>

(See above, No. XI. v. 10.) <i>Sugar</i> at present is cheap and common;
and therefore suggests now a coarse and vulgar idea.</p></div>

THE MURDER OF THE KING OF SCOTS.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i213.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> catastrophe of Henry Stewart, lord Darnley, the unfortunate
husband of Mary Q. of Scots, is the subject
of this ballad. It is here related in that partial, imperfect
manner in which such an event would naturally
strike the subjects of another kingdom, of which he was a native.
Henry appears to have been a vain, capricious, worthless young
man, of weak understanding, and dissolute morals. But the beauty
of his person, and the inexperience of his youth, would dispose
mankind to treat him with an indulgence, which the cruelty of his
murder would afterwards convert into the most tender pity and
regret: and then imagination would not fail to adorn his memory
with all those virtues he ought to have possessed. This will
account for the extravagant elogium bestowed upon him in the
first stanza, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Henry lord Darnley was eldest son of the earl of Lennox, by
the lady Margaret Douglas, niece of Henry VIII. and daughter
of Margaret queen of Scotland by the earl of Angus, whom that
princess married after the death of James IV.&mdash;Darnley, who had
been born and educated in England, was but in his 21st year, when
he was murdered, Feb. 9, 1567-8. This crime was perpetrated by
the E. of Bothwell, not out of respect to the memory of Riccio,
but in order to pave the way for his own marriage with the queen.</p>

<p>This ballad (printed, with a few corrections, from the Editor's
folio MS.) seems to have been written soon after Mary's escape
into England in 1568, see v. 65.&mdash;It will be remembered at v. 5,
that this princess was Q. dowager of France, having been first
married to Francis II. who died Dec. 4, 1560.</p>

<p>[In the above note Percy takes the ordinary unfavourable view
of Darnley's character, which is not entirely borne out by contemporary
evidence. Darnley was unfortunate both in having all
Mary's friends as his enemies and in having no supporters among
her opponents because he was a Roman Catholic. It is not fair to
dispose of such a ballad as the present with the inference that the
writer could know nothing of Darnley's character. It does not
stand alone, and it appears from the broadsides that circulated
through the country after his murder that the people had a real
liking for him although he had been amongst them only a couple
of years. Robert Lekprevik, the most celebrated Edinburgh
printer of his time, printed in 1567, <i>The Testament and Tragedie</i>
<i>of umquhile King Henrie Stewart of gude memorie</i>, a powerful poem,
which discovers clearly the popular feeling against Mary. Mr.
Froude also found one of these ballads among the Scottish State
Papers, in which curses are heaped upon Mary, who is called
Dalila, Clytemnestra and Semiramis for her murder of "ane
bonny boy." One of the verses is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"At ten houris on Sunday late at een,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Dalila and Bothwell bade good night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off her finger false she threw ane ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, My Lord ane token you I plight."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the circumstances of the English ballad are related in a partial
and imperfect manner, what shall we say of the much more severe
tone of those written in Scotland. Mr. Maidment<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> has gathered
together a few facts that show how much may be said in favour of
the unfortunate prince. It appears from Colville's <i>Historie and Life</i>
<i>of King James the sext</i>, that Secretary Maitland inflamed Darnley's
mind with the insinuation that Rizzio was too intimate with the
queen. The criminal familiarity of her majesty with Rizzio
appears to have been generally suspected, so that Darnley's
conduct was that of a jealous husband who was fascinated with
his wife. Colville gives the following portrait of him:&mdash;"He was
a cumlie Prince, of a fayre and large stature of bodie, pleasant in
countenance and affable to all men and devote, weill excercesit in
martiall pastymis uponn horsback as ony prince of that age, bot was
sa facile as he could concele no secreit although it myght tend to
his awin weill."<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>He was certainly accomplished and had been carefully educated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>He wrote a little tale called <i>Utopia Nova</i> when he was between
eight and nine years of age, which he presented to his cousin,
Mary Tudor. The queen in return presented him with a gold
chain, which he acknowledged in a letter remarkable for the
extreme beauty of its caligraphy. He also completed a translation
into English of Valerius Maximus. Mr. Froude severely
condemns the character of Darnley in the following terms: "He
was at once meddlesome and incapable, weak and cowardly, yet
insolent and unmanageable," and adds that Randolph described
him as "a conceited, arrogant, intolerant fool." Nevertheless "the
death of the husband of the Queen of Scots belongs to that rare
class of incidents which, like the murder of C&aelig;sar, have touched
the interests of the entire educated world. Perhaps there is no
single recorded act, arising merely out of private or personal passions,
of which the public consequences have been so considerable."<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>Darnley was the second son of the Earl and Countess of Lennox,
and not, as stated above, by Percy, the eldest. Their first-born
died on the 28th of November, 1545, nine months after his birth.</p>

<p>The following ballad is entitled <i>Earle Bodwell</i> in the Folio MS.
(ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 260). In the first three editions
of the <i>Reliques</i> there were more alterations from the MS. than
in the fourth, for in the latter Percy restored several of the old
readings. The retained alterations are judicious, and no more than
the Editor might well feel himself justified in making.]</p></div>

A SONNET BY Q. ELIZABETH.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i218.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> following lines, if they display no rich vein of poetry,
are yet so strongly characteristic of their great and
spirited authoress, that the insertion of them will be
pardoned. They are preserved in Puttenham's <i>Arte</i>
<i>of English Poesie</i>; a book in which are many sly addresses to the
queen's foible of shining as a poetess. The extraordinary manner
in which these verses are introduced shews what kind of homage
was exacted from the courtly writers of that age, viz.</p>

<p>"I find," says this antiquated critic, "none example in English
metre, so well maintaining this figure [<i>Exargasia</i>, or the Gorgeous,
Lat. <i>Expolitio</i>] as that dittie of her majesties owne making, passing
sweete and harmonicall; which figure beyng as his very originall
name purporteth the most bewtifull and gorgious of all others, it
asketh in reason to be reserved for a last complement, and desciphred
by a ladies penne herselfe beyng the most bewtifull, or
rather bewt&igrave;e of queenes.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> And this was the occasion: our soveraigne
lady perceiving how the Scottish queenes residence within
this realme at so great libertie and ease (as were skarce meete for
so great and dangerous a prysoner) bred secret factions among her
people, and made many of the nobilitie incline to favour her partie:
some of them desirous of innovation in the state: others aspiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>to greater fortunes by her libertie and life. The queene our soveraigne
ladie to declare that she was nothing ignorant of those secret
practizes, though she had long with great wisdome and pacience
dissembled it, writeth this dittie most sweete and sententious, not
hiding from all such aspiring minds the daunger of their ambition
and disloyaltie: which afterward fell out most truly by th' exemplary
chastisement of sundry persons, who in fauour of the said Sc.
Q. declining from her Maiestie, sought to interrupt the quiet of the
Realme by many euill and vndutiful practizes." (p. <a href="#Page_207">207</a>.)</p>

<p>This sonnet was probably written in 1584, not long before Hen.
Percy 8th E. of Northumberland was imprisoned on suspicion of
plotting with F. Throckmorton, Tho. Lord Paget, and the Guises,
for invading England, and liberating the Q. of Scots, &amp;c. (See
Collins's <i>Peerage</i>, 1779, ii. 405.) The original is written in long
lines or alexandrines, each of which is here, on account of the
narrowness of the page, subdivided into two: but her majesty's
orthography, or at least that of her copyist, is exactly followed.</p>

<p>In the first edition of Harrington's <i>Nug&aelig; Antiqu&aelig;</i>, 1st vol. 1769,
12mo. p. 58, is a copy of this poem, with great variations, the best
of which are noted below. It is there accompanied with a very
curious letter, in which this sonnet is said to be "of her Highness
own enditing ... My Lady Willoughby did covertly get it on her
Majesties tablet, and had much hazard in so doing; for the Queen
did find out the thief, and chid for spreading evil bruit of her
writing such toyes, when other matters did so occupy her employment
at this time; and was fearful of being thought too lightly of
for so doing." ***</p>

KING OF SCOTS AND ANDREW
BROWNE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i221.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> ballad is a proof of the little intercourse that subsisted
between the Scots and English, before the accession of
James I. to the crown of England. The tale which is
here so circumstantially related does not appear to have
had the least foundation in history, but was probably built upon
some confused hearsay report of the tumults in Scotland during the
minority of that prince, and of the conspiracies formed by different
factions to get possession of his person. It should seem
from ver. 97 to have been written during the regency, or at least
before the death, of the earl of Morton, who was condemned and
executed June 2, 1581; when James was in his 15th year.</p>

<p>The original copy (preserved in the archives of the Antiquarian
Society, London) is intitled, <i>A new Ballad, declaring the great</i>
<i>treason conspired against the young king of Scots, and how one Andrew</i>
<i>Browne an Englishman, which was the king's chamberlaine,</i>
<i>prevented the same. To the tune of Milfield, or els to Green-sleeves.</i>
At the end is subjoined the name of the author "W. Elderton.
Imprinted at London for Yarathe James, dwelling in Newgate
Market, over against Ch. Church," in black-letter, folio.</p>

<p>This <i>Elderton</i>, who had been originally an attorney in the
sheriffs' courts of London, and afterwards (if we may believe
Oldys) a comedian, was a facetious fuddling companion, whose
tippling and rhymes rendered him famous among his contemporaries.
He was author of many popular songs and ballads:
and probably other pieces in these volumes, besides the following,
are of his composing. He is believed to have fallen a victim to
his bottle before the year 1592. His epitaph has been recorded
by Camden, and translated by Oldys:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hic situs est sitiens, atque ebrius Eldertonus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quid dico hic situs est? hic potius sitis est,"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Dead drunk here Elderton doth lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dead as he is, he still is dry:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So of him it may well be said,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Here he, but not his thirst, is laid."<br /></span>

<p>[This ballad was licensed to Y. James on the 30th of May, 1581.
Percy does not mention in the above note the fact that the ballad
is included in the Folio MS., where it is entitled <i>Bishoppe and</i>
<i>Browne</i> (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 265). It only consists
of ten stanzas in place of fifteen, and two of them are incomplete.
There is a sort of second part, probably also by Elderton, called
<i>King James and Brown</i>, in the MS. (vol. i. p. 135), the villain of
which is the same Douglas who is warned in the 98th verse of the
present ballad to "take heede you do not offend the king."]</p></div>

THE BONNY EARL OF MURRAY.</h3>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">A Scottish Song.</span>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i226.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> December, 1591, Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell,
had made an attempt to seize on the person of his
sovereign James VI., but being disappointed, had retired
towards the north. The king unadvisedly gave a commission
to George Gordon Earl of Huntley, to pursue Bothwell
and his followers with fire and sword. Huntley, under cover of
executing that commission, took occasion to revenge a private
quarrel he had against James Stewart Earl of Murray, a relation
of Bothwell's. In the night of Feb. 7, 1592, he beset Murray's
house, burnt it to the ground, and slew Murray himself; a young
nobleman of the most promising virtues, and the very darling of
the people. See Robertson's <i>Hist.</i></p>

<p>The present Lord Murray hath now in his possession a picture
of his ancestor naked and covered with wounds, which had been
carried about, according to the custom of that age, in order to
inflame the populace to revenge his death. If this picture did not
flatter, he well deserved the name of the <i>bonny Earl</i>, for he is there
represented as a tall and comely personage. It is a tradition in
the family, that Gordon of Bucky gave him a wound in the face:
Murray half expiring, said, "You hae spilt a better face than your
awin." Upon this, Bucky pointing his dagger at Huntley's breast,
swore, "You shall be as deep as I;" and forced him to pierce the
poor defenceless body.</p>

<p>K. James, who took no care to punish the murtherers, is said by
some to have privately countenanced and abetted them, being
stimulated by jealousy for some indiscreet praises which his Queen
had too lavishly bestowed on this unfortunate youth. See the
preface to the next ballad. See also Mr. Walpole's <i>Catalogue of</i>
<i>Royal Auth.</i> vol. i. p. 42.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[James Stewart, son of Sir James Stewart of Doune, acquired
the earldom of Murray by his marriage with Elizabeth, eldest
daughter and heiress of the Regent Murray. The earl was only
twenty-one years of age at the time of his murder, which was
perpetrated at Dinnibrissel, the seat of his mother, where he was
on a visit. Doune Castle in Menteith is now in ruins, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
still the property of the family, and gives the title of Viscount to
the eldest son of the Earl of Murray. The Earl of Huntley,
instead of being punished for his crime, was created a marquis,
and King James made the young earl of Murray marry the eldest
daughter of his father's murderer.</p>

<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">A Scottish Ballad.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i228.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been suggested to the Editor, that this ballad
covertly alludes to the indiscreet partiality, which
Q. Anne of Denmark is said to have shewn for the
<i>bonny Earl of Murray</i>; and which is supposed to have
influenced the fate of that unhappy nobleman. Let the reader
judge for himself.</p>

<p>The following account of the murder is given by a contemporary
writer, and a person of credit, Sir James Balfour, knight, Lyon
King of Arms, whose MS. of the Annals of Scotland is in the
Advocates library at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>"The seventh of Febry, this yeire, 1592, the Earle of Murray
was cruelly murthered by the Earle of Huntley at his house in
Dunibrissel in Fyffe-shyre, and with him Dumbar, shriffe of Murray.
It [was] given out and publickly talked, that the Earle
of Huntley was only the instrument of perpetrating this facte,
to satisfie the King's jealousie of Murray, quhum the Queine
more rashely than wyslie, some few dayes before had commendit
in the King's heiringe, with too many epithets of a proper and
gallant man. The reasons of these surmises proceidit from proclamatione
of the Kings, the 18 of Marche following; inhibiting
the younge Earle of Murray to persue the Earle of Huntley, for his
father's slaughter, in respect he being wardit [imprisoned] in the
castell of Blacknesse for the same murther, was willing to abide
his tryall, averring that he had done nothing bot by the King's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>majesties commissione; and was neither airt nor part of the
murther."<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>The following ballad is here given from a copy printed not long
since at Glasgow, in one sheet 8vo. The world was indebted for
its publication to the lady Jean Hume, sister to the Earl of Hume,
who died at Gibraltar [in 1761].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Buchan, who printed a longer version of this ballad in thirty-nine
stanzas, believed young Waters to have been David Graham
of Fintray, who was found guilty of being concerned in a Popish
plot, and beheaded on the 16th of February, 1592. Chambers
supposed that the fate of some one of the Scottish nobles executed
by James I. after his return from captivity in England is alluded to.
The various conflicting conjectures are none of them very probable,
and there is nothing in the ballad that would conclusively connect
it with authentic Scottish history. Percy's suggestion is peculiarly
unfortunate, as young Waters was publicly executed at Stirling.
Mr. Maidment points out (<i>Scottish Ballads and Songs</i>, vol. i. p. 62)
that the first edition appeared under the following title, <i>Young</i>
<i>Waters, an Ancient Scotish Poem, never before printed. Glasgow:</i>
<i>printed and sold by Robert and Andrew Foulis, MDCCLV.</i> sm. 4to.
pp. 8; and he suggests that Lord Hailes was the editor of it.]</p></div>

MARY AMBREE.</h3>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1584, the Spaniards, under the command of
Alexander Farnese, prince of Parma, began to gain
great advantages in Flanders and Brabant, by recovering
many strong holds and cities from the Hollanders,
as Ghent, (called then by the English <i>Gaunt</i>,) Antwerp,
Mechlin, &amp;c. See Stow's <i>Annals</i>, p. 711. Some attempt made
with the assistance of English volunteers to retrieve the former of
those places probably gave occasion to this ballad. I can find no
mention of our heroine in history, but the following rhymes rendered
her famous among our poets. Ben Jonson often mentions her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>and calls any remarkable virago by her name. See his <i>Epic&oelig;ne</i>,
first acted in 1609, act iv. sc. 2. His <i>Tale of a Tub</i>, act i. sc. 2.
And his masque intitled the <i>Fortunate Isles</i>, 1626, where he quotes
the very words of the ballad,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----"<i>Mary Ambree</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Who marched so free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the siege of Gaunt,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As the ballad doth vaunt)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were a braver wight, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She is also mentioned in Fletcher's <i>Scornful Lady</i>, act v. <i>sub</i>
<i>finem</i>.</p>

<p>----"My large gentlewoman, my <i>Mary Ambree</i>, had I but
seen into you, you should have had another bed-fellow."&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is likewise evident, that she is the virago intended by Butler
in <i>Hudibras</i> (p. i. c. iii. v. 365), by her being coupled with <i>Joan</i>
<i>d'Arc</i>, the celebrated <i>Pucelle d'Orleans</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A bold virago stout and tall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As <i>Joan</i> of France, or English <i>Mall</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This ballad is printed from a black letter copy in the Pepys
Collection, improved from the Editor's folio MS. and by conjecture.
The full title is, <i>The valorous acts performed at Gaunt by the brave</i>
<i>bonnie lass Mary Ambree, who in revenge of her lovers death did play</i>
<i>her part most gallantly</i>. The tune is, <i>The blind beggar, &amp;c.</i></p>

BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBEY.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i238.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Peregrine</span> Bertie, lord Willoughby of Eresby, had,
in the year 1586, distinguished himself at the siege of
Zutphen, in the Low Countries. He was the year after
made general of the English forces in the United Provinces,
in room of the earl of Leicester, who was recalled. This
gave him an opportunity of signalizing his courage and military
skill in several actions against the Spaniards. One of these,
greatly exaggerated by popular report, is probably the subject of
this old ballad, which, on account of its flattering encomiums on
English valour, hath always been a favourite with the people.</p>

<p>"My lord Willoughbie (says a contemporary writer) was one of
the queenes best swordsmen: ... he was a great master of the art
military ... I have heard it spoken, that had he not slighted the
court, but applied himself to the queene, he might have enjoyed a
plentifull portion of her grace; and it was his saying, and it did
him no good, that he was none of the <i>Reptilia</i>; intimating, that
he could not creepe on the ground, and that the court was not
his element; for indeed, as he was a great souldier, so he was of
suitable magnanimitie, and could not brooke the obsequiousnesse
and assiduitie of the courte." (<i>Naunton.</i>)</p>

<p>Lord Willoughbie died in 1601.&mdash;Both Norris and Turner were
famous among the military men of that age.</p>

<p>The subject of this ballad (which is printed from an old black-letter
copy, with some conjectural emendations,) may possibly
receive illustration from what <i>Chapman</i> says in the Dedicat. to his
version of Homer's <i>Frogs and Mice</i>, concerning the brave and
memorable Retreat of Sir John Norris, with only 1000 men, thro'
the whole Spanish army, under the duke of Parma, for three miles
together.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Lord Willoughby was the son of Katherine, daughter of Lord
Willoughby of Eresby and widow of Charles Brandon, Duke of
Suffolk, and of her second husband, Richard Bertie. They were
protestants and were forced to fly from persecution in 1553, taking
refuge first in the Low Countries and afterwards in Poland. They
called their son in consequence Peregrine, a name that has ever
since remained in the family. Mr. Hales has drawn my attention
to the fact that Spenser, when in Ireland, named one of his sons
Peregrine for a similar reason. A ballad was written entitled <i>The</i>
<i>Duchess of Suffolk's Calamity</i>, which contains these lines:</p></div>

THE WINNING OF CALES.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i243.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of this ballad is the taking of the city of
<i>Cadiz</i>, (called by our sailors corruptly <i>Cales</i>) on June
21, 1596, in a descent made on the coast of Spain,
under the command of the Lord Howard admiral, and
the earl of Essex general.</p>

<p>The valour of Essex was not more distinguished on this occasion
than his generosity: the town was carried sword in hand, but
he stopt the slaughter as soon as possible, and treated his prisoners
with the greatest humanity, and even affability and kindness. The
English made a rich plunder in the city, but missed of a much
richer, by the resolution which the Duke of Medina, the Spanish
admiral, took, of setting fire to the ships, in order to prevent their
falling into the hands of the enemy [see v. 27]. It was computed,
that the loss which the Spaniards sustained from this enterprize,
amounted to twenty millions of ducats. See Hume's <i>Hist</i>.</p>

<p>The Earl of Essex knighted on this occasion not fewer than
sixty persons, which gave rise to the following sarcasm:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A gentleman of Wales, a knight of Cales,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a laird of the North country;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a yeoman of Kent with his yearly rent<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will buy them out all three."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ballad is printed, with some corrections, from the Editor's
folio MS. and seems to have been composed by some person, who
was concerned in the expedition. Most of the circumstances
related in it will be found supported by history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Philip II. was meditating the dispatch of a second armada,
but before he could set his schemes in motion his strongest fortress
was razed to the ground. Macaulay calls this "the most brilliant
military exploit that was achieved on the continent by English
arms during the long interval which elapsed between the battle of
Agincourt and that of Blenheim." No wonder then that the English
sang with enthusiasm of the glories of their success. Raleigh
and Sir Francis Vere were among the leaders under Essex.</p>

<p>It will be seen by the foot notes that Percy follows his MS.
original pretty faithfully. Child prints a version from Deloney's
<i>Garland of Goodwill</i> as reprinted by the Percy Society (vol. xxx.
p. 113). The earliest notice of the tune (the new Tantara) to
which this ballad was to be sung is in the year 1590.]</p></div>

THE SPANISH LADY'S LOVE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i247.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> beautiful old ballad most probably took its rise
from one of these descents made on the Spanish coasts
in the time of queen Elizabeth; and in all likelihood
from that which is celebrated in the foregoing ballad.</p>

<p>It was a tradition in the West of England, that the person
admired by the Spanish lady was a gentleman of the Popham
family [Sir John Popham], and that her picture, with the pearl
necklace mentioned in the ballad, was not many years ago preserved
at Littlecot, near Hungerford, Wilts, the seat of that respectable
family.</p>

<p>Another tradition hath pointed out Sir Richard Levison, of
Trentham, in Staffordshire, as the subject of this ballad; who
married Margaret daughter of Charles Earl of Nottingham; and
was eminently distinguished as a naval officer and commander in
all the expeditions against the Spaniards in the latter end of
Q. Elizabeth's reign, particularly in that to Cadiz in 1596, when
he was aged 27. He died in 1605, and has a monument, with
his effigy in brass, in Wolverhampton church.</p>

<p>It is printed from an ancient black-letter copy, corrected in part
by the Editor's folio MS.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Sir John Popham and Sir Richard Levison are not the only
candidates for the honour of being associated with the Spanish
Lady, for strong claims have also been brought forward in favour
of Sir Urias Legh of Adlington, Cheshire, and of Sir John Bolle of
Thorpe Hall, Lincolnshire. A descendant of the latter worthy
wrote a letter in his favour, which appeared in the <i>Times</i> of May 1,
1846, and from which the following particulars are extracted:&mdash;"In
Illingworth's <i>Topographical Account of Scampton, with Anecdotes</i>
<i>of the family of Bolles</i>, it is stated, 'the portrait of Sir John,
drawn in 1596, at the age of thirty-six years, having on him the
gold chain given him by the Spanish Lady, &amp;c., is still in the possession
of Captain Birch.' That portrait is now in the possession
of Captain Birch's successor, Thomas Bosvile, Esq., of
Ravensfield Park, Yorkshire." The writer of the letter signs
himself Charles Lee, and dates from Coldrey, Hants. He adds
another extract from Illingworth's <i>Scampton</i>, which is as follows:
"On Sir John Bolle's departure from Cadiz, the Spanish
Lady sent as presents to his wife, a profusion of jewels, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
valuables, amongst which was her portrait, drawn in green, plate,
money, and other treasure. Some articles are still in the possession
of the family, though her picture was unfortunately and by accident,
disposed of about half a century since. This portrait being
drawn in green, gave occasion to her being called in the neighbourhood
of Thorpe Hall, the Green Lady, where to this day
there is a traditionary superstition among the vulgar that Thorpe
Hall was haunted by the Green Lady, who used nightly to take
her seat in a particular tree near the mansion."</p>

<p>Mr. Chappell points out that this ballad is quoted in <i>Cupid's</i>
<i>Whirligig</i>, 1616, and parodied in Rowley's <i>A Match at Midnight</i>,
1633. It is also quoted in Mrs. Behn's Comedy, <i>The Rovers, or</i>
<i>the banished Cavaliers</i>, and in Richard Brome's <i>Northern Lasse</i>.</p>

<p>Shenstone was not satisfied with the beautiful simplicity of this
charming ballad, and attempted in his <i>Moral Tale of Love and</i>
<i>Honour</i> to place it before his readers "in less grovelling accents
than the simple guise of ancient record." The mode he adopted
was to spin it out by the frequent introduction of <i>Ah me</i> and
<i>'tis true</i>, and addresses to the "generous maid," Elvira, Iberia, &amp;c.
Wordsworth acted far differently, when he founded his exquisite
<i>Armenian Lady's Love</i> upon this ballad:</p></div>

ARGENTILE AND CURAN,</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i252.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">Is</span> extracted from an ancient historical poem in XIII.
Books, intitled, <i>Albion's England</i>, by <i>William Warner</i>:
"An author (says a former editor,) only unhappy in the
choice of his subject, and measure of his verse. His
poem is an epitome of the British history, and written with great
learning, sense, and spirit. In some places fine to an extraordinary
degree, as I think will eminently appear in the ensuing episode
(of Argentile and Curan). A tale full of beautiful incidents in
the romantic taste, extremely affecting, rich in ornament, wonderfully
various in style; and in short, one of the most beautiful
pastorals I ever met with." (<i>Muses Library</i>, 1738, 8vo.) To his
merit nothing can be objected unless perhaps an affected quaintness
in some of his expressions, and an indelicacy in some of his
pastoral images.</p>

<p><i>Warner</i> is said, by A. Wood,<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> to have been a Warwickshire
man, and to have been educated in Oxford, at Magdalene-hall:
as also in the latter part of his life to have been retained in the
service of Henry Cary Lord Hunsdon, to whom he dedicates his
poem. However that may have been, new light is thrown upon
his history, and the time and manner of his death are now ascertained,
by the following extract from the parish register book of
Amwell, in Hertfordshire; which was obligingly communicated
to the Editor by Mr. <i>Hoole</i>, the very ingenious translator of
Tasso, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(1608&mdash;1609.) "Master William Warner, a man of good yeares
and of honest reputation; by his profession an Atturnye of the
Common Pleas; author of <i>Albions England</i>, diynge suddenly in
the night in his bedde, without any former complaynt or sicknesse,
on thursday night beeinge the 9th daye of March; was buried the
satturday following, and lyeth in the church at the corner under
the stone of Walter Ffader." Signed <i>Tho. Hassall Vicarius</i>.</p>

<p>Though now Warner is so seldom mentioned, his contemporaries
ranked him on a level with Spenser, and called them the Homer
and Virgil of their age.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> But Warner rather resembled <i>Ovid</i>,
whose <i>Metamorphoses</i> he seems to have taken for his model, having
deduced a perpetual poem from the deluge down to the &aelig;ra of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>Elizabeth, full of lively digressions and entertaining episodes.
And though he is sometimes harsh, affected, and obscure, he
often displays a most charming and pathetic simplicity: as where
he describes Eleanor's harsh treatment of Rosamond:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With that she dasht her on the lippes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So dyed double red:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard was the heart that gave the blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soft were those lippes that bled."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The edition of <i>Albion's England</i> here followed was printed in
4to. 1602; said in the title-page to have been "first penned and
published by William Warner, and now revised and newly enlarged
by the same author." The story of <i>Argentile and Curan</i> is I believe
the poet's own invention; it is not mentioned in any of our
chronicles. It was however so much admired, that not many
years after he published it, came out a larger poem on the same
subject in stanzas of six lines, intitled, <i>The most pleasant and delightful</i>
<i>historie of Curan a prince of Danske, and the fayre princesse</i>
<i>Argentile, daughter and heyre to Adelbright, sometime king of Northumberland,</i>
<i>&amp;c. by</i> William Webster, <i>London</i>, 1617, in 8 sheets 4to.
An indifferent paraphrase of the following poem.&mdash;This episode of
Warner's has also been altered into the common ballad, <i>of the two</i>
<i>young Princes on Salisbury Plain</i>, which is chiefly composed of
Warner's lines, with a few contractions and interpolations, but all
greatly for the worse. See the collection of <i>Hist. Ballads</i>, 1727,
3 vols. 12mo.</p>

correct many popular mistakes relating to her catastrophe. The
first is from Sir Thomas More's <i>History of Richard III.</i> written in
1513, about thirty years after the death of Edw. IV.</p>

<p>"Now then by and by, as it wer for anger, not for covetise, the
protector sent into the house of Shores wife (for her husband
dwelled not with her) and spoiled her of al that ever she had,
(above the value of 2 or 3 thousand marks) and sent her body to
prison. And when he had a while laide unto her, for the maner
sake, that she went about to bewitch him, and that she was of
counsel with the lord chamberlein to destroy him: in conclusion
when that no colour could fasten upon these matters, then he layd
heinously to her charge the thing that herselfe could not deny, that
al the world wist was true, and that natheles every man laughed at
to here it then so sodainly so highly taken,&mdash;that she was naught
of her body. And for thys cause (as a goodly continent prince,
clene and fautless of himself, sent oute of heaven into this vicious
world for the amendment of mens maners) he caused the bishop
of London to put her to open pennance, going before the crosse
in procession upon a sonday with a taper in her hand. In which
she went in countenance and pace demure so womanly; and albeit
she was out of al array save her kyrtle only, yet went she so fair
and lovely, namelye, while the wondering of the people caste a
comly rud in her chekes (of which she before had most misse) that
her great shame wan her much praise among those that were more
amorous of her body, then curious of her soule. And many good
folke also, that hated her living, and glad wer to se sin corrected,
yet pittied thei more her penance then rejoiced therin, when thei
considred that the protector procured it more of a corrupt intent,
then any virtuous affeccion.</p>

<p>"This woman was born in London, worshipfully frended, honestly
brought up, and very wel maryed, saving somewhat too soone;
her husbande an honest citizen, yonge, and goodly, and of good
substance. But forasmuche as they were coupled ere she wer wel
ripe, she not very fervently loved, for whom she never longed.
Which was happely the thinge, that the more easily made her
encline unto the king's appetite, when he required her. Howbeit
the respect of his royaltie, the hope of gay apparel, ease, plesure,
and other wanton welth, was able soone to perse a soft tender
hearte. But when the king had abused her, anon her husband (as
he was an honest man, and one that could his good, not presuming
to touch a kinges concubine) left her up to him al together. When
the king died, the lord chamberlen [Hastings] toke her:<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>in the kinges daies, albeit he was sore enamoured upon her, yet
he forbare her, either for reverence, or for a certain friendly faithfulness.</p>

<p>"Proper she was, and faire: nothing in her body that you wold
have changed, but if you would have wished her somewhat higher.
Thus say thei that knew her in her youthe. Albeit some that <i>now</i>
<i>see her</i> (<i>for yet she liveth</i>) deme her never to have bene wel visaged.
Whose jugement seemeth me somewhat like, as though men should
gesse the bewty of one longe before departed, by her scalpe taken
out of the charnel-house; for now is she old, lene, withered, and
dried up, nothing left but ryvilde skin, and hard bone. And yet
being even such, whoso wel advise her visage, might gesse and
devise which partes how filled, wold make it a fair face.</p>

<p>"Yet delited not men so much in her bewty, as in her pleasant
behaviour. For a proper wit had she, and could both rede wel
and write; mery in company, redy and quick of aunswer, neither
mute nor ful of bable; sometime taunting without displeasure, and
not without disport. The king would say, That he had three concubines,
which in three divers properties diversly excelled. One
the meriest, another the wiliest, the thirde the holiest harlot in his
realme, as one whom no man could get out of the church lightly
to any place, but it were to his bed. The other two wer somwhat
greater personages, and natheles of their humilite content to be
nameles, and to forbere the praise of those properties; but the
meriest was the Shoris wife, in whom the king therfore toke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>special pleasure. For many he had, but her he loved, whose
favour, to sai the trouth (for sinne it wer to belie the devil) she
never abused to any mans hurt, but to many a mans comfort and
relief. Where the king toke displeasure, she would mitigate and
appease his mind: where men were out of favour, she wold bring
them in his grace: for many, that had highly offended, shee
obtained pardon: of great forfeitures she gate men remission: and
finally in many weighty sutes she stode many men in gret stede,
either for none or very smal rewardes, and those rather gay than
rich: either for that she was content with the dede selfe well done,
or for that she delited to be sued unto, and to show what she was
able to do wyth the king, or for that wanton women and welthy be
not alway covetous.</p>

<p>"I doubt not some shal think this woman too sleight a thing
to be written of, and set amonge the remembraunces of great
matters: which thei shal specially think, that happely shal esteme
her only by that thei <i>now see her</i>. But me semeth the chaunce so
much the more worthy to be remembred, in how much she is <i>now</i>
in the more beggerly condicion, unfrended and worne out of acquaintance,
after good substance, after as grete favour with the
prince, after as grete sute and seeking to with al those, that in
those days had busynes to spede, as many other men were in their
times, which be now famouse only by the infamy of their il dedes.
Her doinges were not much lesse, albeit thei be muche lesse
remembred because thei were not so evil. For men use, if they
have an evil turne, to write it in marble; and whoso doth us a
good tourne, we write it in duste.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> Which is not worst proved by
her; for <i>at this daye</i> shee beggeth of many at this daye living, that
at this day had begged, if shee had not bene." See More's <i>workes</i>,
folio, bl. let. 1557, pp. 56, 57.</p>

<p><i>Drayton</i> has written a poetical epistle from this lady to her royal
lover, and in his notes thereto he thus draws her portrait: "Her
stature was meane, her haire of a dark yellow, her face round and
full, her eye gray, delicate harmony being betwixt each part's proportion,
and each proportion's colour, her body fat, white and smooth,
her countenance cheerfull and like to her condition. The picture
which I have seen of hers was such as she rose out of her bed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>morning, having nothing on but a rich mantle cast under one arme
over her shoulder, and sitting on a chaire, on which her naked
arm did lie. What her father's name was, or where she was borne,
is not certainly knowne: but Shore, a young man of right goodly
person, wealth and behaviour, abandoned her bed after the king
had made her his concubine. Richard III. causing her to do open
penance in Paul's church-yard, <i>commanded that no man should</i>
<i>relieve her</i>, which the tyrant did, not so much for his hatred to
sinne, but that by making his brother's life odious, he might cover his
horrible treasons the more cunningly." See <i>England's Heroical</i>
<i>Epistles</i>, by Mich. Drayton, Esq; Lond. 1637, 12mo.</p>

<p>An original picture of <i>Jane Shore</i> almost naked is preserved in
the Provost's Lodgings at Eton; and another picture of her is in
the Provost's Lodge at King's College, Cambridge: to both which
foundations she is supposed to have done friendly offices with
<i>Edward IV.</i> A small quarto Mezzotinto print was taken from
the former of these by <i>J. Faber</i>.</p>

<p>The history of <i>Jane Shore</i> receives new illustration from the
following letter of <i>K. Richard III.</i> which is preserved in the <i>Harl.</i>
<i>MSS.</i> Num. 433, Art. 2378, but of which the copy transmitted to
the Editor has been reduced to modern orthography, &amp;c. It is
said to have been addressed to <i>Russel</i> bp. of Lincoln, lord chancellor,
Anno 1484.</p>

<p class="center">By the <i>King</i>.
</p>

<p>"Right Reverend Father in God, &amp;c. signifying unto you, that
it is shewed unto us, that our Servant and Solicitor Thomas Lynom,
marvellously blinded and abused with the late Wife of William
Shore, now living in Ludgate by our commandment, hath made
Contract of Matrimony with her, as it is said, and intendeth, to our
full great marvel, to effect the same. WE, for many causes, would
be sorry that he should be so disposed; pray you therefore to send
for him, and in that ye goodly may, exhort, and stir him to the
contrary: And if ye find him utterly set for to marry her, and none
otherwise would be advertized, then, if it may stand with the laws
of the church, we be content the time of marriage be deferred to
our coming next to London; that upon sufficient Surety found of
her good abearing, ye do so send for her Keeper, and discharge
him of our said commandment, by Warrant of these, committing
her to the rule, and guiding of her Father, or any other, by your
direction, in the mean season. Given, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="stageright">"<i>RIC.</i> Rex."<br /></p>

<p>It appears from two articles in the same MS. that K. Richard
had granted to the said <i>Thomas Linom</i> the office of King's Solicitor
(Art. 134.), and also the Manor of Colmeworth, com. Bedf. to him
and his Heirs Male (Art. 596.)</p>

<p>The following ballad is printed (with some corrections) from an
old black-letter copy in the Pepys collection. Its full title is, <i>The</i>
<i>woefull lamentation of Jane Shore, a goldsmith's wife in London,</i>
<i>sometime king Edward IV. his concubine</i>. To the tune of <i>Live with</i>
<i>me, &amp;c.</i> (See the first volume.) To every stanza is annexed the
following burthen:</p>

<p>[The tale of Jane Shore's sufferings has found frequent narrators.
The first known ballad upon her story was written by Thomas
Churchyard (who died in 1604) and is included in the <i>Mirror for</i>
<i>Magistrates</i>. The ballad here printed is attributed to Thomas
Deloney, and was entered on the books of the Stationers' Company
to William White, printer, on the 11th of June, 1603, but no
copy of this edition is known to exist. Mr. Chappell remarks that
no copy in any of the collections can be dated "earlier than
Charles the Second's time, or at most than the Protectorate"
(<i>Roxburghe Ballads</i>, vol. i. p. 479). It is printed in the <i>Collection</i>
<i>of Old Ballads</i>, 1723 (vol. i. p. 145), and in the same collection is
a burlesque song called <i>King Edward and Jane Shore</i> (vol. i.
p. 153). The Roxburghe copy has a second part which Mr. Chappell
says is "probably by another hand and of later date." Deloney
has paid very little attention to facts, and many of his statements
are groundless, for instance no one was hanged for succouring
Jane (vv. 105-112), and instead of dying of hunger in a
ditch (vv. 125-132), she survived her penance nearly fifty years.
(She died in the 18th year of Henry VIII.'s reign.) Her husband
is named Matthew Shore in verse 13, but we have the
best authority for affirming that his true name was William.
Richard III. followed Jane Shore with unrelenting hate, and not
content with making her do penance, clapping her in prison and
depriving her of all her property, which amounted to the value of
3000 marks, equal to about <i>&pound;</i>20,000 of our present money, he
prevented her from marrying a respectable man.</p>

<p>There is no date to the paper printed above, but as John Russell,
D.D., Bishop of Lincoln, was Richard's Chancellor only from
Nov. 1484 to July 1485, we can fix it pretty closely.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Nugent Bell, in his <i>Huntingdon Peerage</i>, the
name of the father of Jane Shore was Thomas Wainstead. Granger
says that the Duchess of Montagu had a lock of her hair which
looked as if it had been powdered with gold dust. For further
information, see <i>Some Particulars of the Life of Jane Shore</i>, by the
Rev. Mark Noble, in Brayley's <i>Graphic Illustrator</i>, pp. 49-64.]</p></div>

Dorset, son to Edward IV.'s queen. In Rymer's <i>F&oelig;dera</i> is a proclamation
of Richard's, dated at Leicester, Oct. 23, 1483, wherein
a reward of 1000 marks in money, or 100 a year in land is offered
for taking "Thomas late marquis of Dorset," who, "not having
the fear of God, nor the salvation of his own soul, before his eyes,
has damnably debauched and defiled many maids, widows, and
wives, and <i>lived in actual adultery with the wife of Shore</i>." Buckingham
was at that time in rebellion, but as Dorset was not with him,
Richard could not accuse him of treason, and therefore made a
handle of these pretended debaucheries to get him apprehended.

<p>[The Rev. Mark Noble writes as follows of the charge made by
Richard of Dorset's living in adultery with Jane Shore.&mdash;"It could
not be before she was taken by Edward; it could not be during
that king's life; it could not be afterwards, by Richard's own
account, for by his proclamation she then was the mistress of
Hastings to the night preceding his being put to death. It could
not be after that catastrophe, for ever after then Richard kept
her either in the Tower or in Ludgate a close prisoner."&mdash;<i>Brayley's</i>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> little simple elegy is given, with some corrections,
from two copies, one of which is in <i>The golden garland</i>

<p>The burthen of the song, <i>Ding Dong</i>, &amp;c. is at present
appropriated to burlesque subjects, and therefore may excite only
ludicrous ideas in a modern reader; but in the time of our poet it
usually accompanied the most solemn and mournful strains. Of
this kind is that fine a&euml;rial Dirge in Shakespear's <i>Tempest</i>:</p>

in a manner the most solemn and expressive of melancholy.</p>

Satire; a manner of moralizing, which, if it was not

<i>Visions</i>,<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> was at least chiefly brought into repute by
that ancient Satirist. It is not so generally known that the kind
of verse used in this ballad hath any affinity with the peculiar
metre of that writer, for which reason I shall throw together some
cursory remarks on that very singular species of versification, the
nature of which has been so little understood.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

the old copy are here corrected; but with notice to the Reader,
wherever it was judged necessary, by inclosing the corrections
between inverted 'commas.'</p>

THE WANDERING JEW.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i291.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> story of the Wandering Jew is of considerable antiquity:
it had obtained full credit in this part of the
world before the year 1228, as we learn from Mat.
Paris. For in that year, it seems, there came an Armenian
archbishop into England, to visit the shrines and reliques
preserved in our churches; who, being entertained at the monastery
of St. Albans, was asked several questions relating to his country,
&amp;c. Among the rest a monk, who sat near him, inquired, "if he
had ever seen or heard of the famous person named Joseph, that
was so much talked of; who was present at our Lord's crucifixion
and conversed with him, and who was still alive in confirmation of
the Christian faith." The archbishop answered, That the fact was
true. And afterwards one of his train, who was well known to a
servant of the abbot's, interpreting his master's words, told them
in French, "That his lord knew the person they spoke of very
well: that he had dined at his table but a little while before he
left the East: that he had been Pontius Pilate's porter, by name
Cartaphilus; who, when they were dragging Jesus out of the door
of the Judgment-hall, struck him with his fist on the back, saying,
'Go faster, Jesus, go faster: why dost thou linger?' Upon which
Jesus looked at him with a frown and said, 'I indeed am going, but
thou shall tarry till I come.' Soon after he was converted, and baptized
by the name of Joseph. He lives for ever, but at the end of
every hundred years falls into an incurable illness, and at length into
a fit or ecstacy, out of which when he recovers, he returns to the
same state of youth he was in when Jesus suffered, being then
about thirty years of age. He remembers all the circumstances
of the death and resurrection of Christ, the saints that arose with
him, the composing of the apostles' creed, their preaching, and dispersion;
and is himself a very grave and holy person." This is the
substance of Matthew Paris's account, who was himself a monk of
St. Albans, and was living at the time when this Armenian archbishop
made the above relation.</p>

<p>Since his time several impostors have appeared at intervals
under the name and character of the <i>Wandering Jew</i>; whose
several histories may be seen in Calmet's <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>.
See also the <i>Turkish Spy</i>, vol. ii. book 3, let. 1. The story that is
copied in the following ballad is of one, who appeared at Hamburgh
in 1547, and pretended he had been a Jewish shoemaker at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the time of Christ's crucifixion.&mdash;The ballad however seems to
be of later date. It is preserved in black-letter in the Pepys collection.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This wondrous myth has found its way into many literatures,
and numerous theories have been brought forward to account for
its universality; but the only foundation for it appears to be in
Christ's words&mdash;"tarry till I come." Mons. Paul Lacroix, however,
suggests that it took its rise in a grand and beautiful allegory
in which the Hebrew race were personified under the figure of
the Everlasting Wanderer. Professor Child makes the following
pertinent remark in his <i>English and Scottish Ballads</i> (vol. viii.
p. 78). "It will be noticed that in the second form of the legend,
the punishment of perpetual existence, which gives rise to the old
names, <i>Jud&aelig;us non mortalis</i>, <i>Ewiger Jude</i>, is aggravated by a condemnation
to incessant change of place, which is indicated by
a corresponding name, <i>Wandering Jew</i>, <i>Juif Errant</i>, &amp;c."</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages it was supposed by some that Cain was the
Wandering Jew, but the Mahometan belief was fixed upon Samiri,
who, during the absence of Moses, enticed the people to worship
the golden calf. In G. Weil's <i>The Bible, the Koran, and the Talmud</i>,
1846 (p. 127), we read, "Moses then summoned Samiri, and
would have put him to death instantly, but Allah directed that he
should be sent into banishment. Ever since that time he roams
like a wild beast throughout the world; everyone shuns him and
purifies the ground on which his feet have stood; and he himself,
whenever he approaches men, exclaims, 'Touch me not.'" (Quoted
in Buckle's <i>Common Place Book</i>. <i>Works</i>, vol. ii. p. 502, 1872.)</p>

<p>The legend has been localized in various parts of the world and
connected with other myths. According to Mr. Baring Gould, a
similar curse to that under which the Wandering Jew is living is
supposed to have been inflicted upon the gipsies, on account of
their refusal to shelter the Virgin and Child in the flight into
Egypt.</p>

<p>The last recorded appearance of the Wandering Jew was at
Brussels in April, 1774, and the wanderer's name was Isaac
Laquedem. The name of the Hamburgh impostor, mentioned
above by Percy, was Ahasuerus.]</p></div>

editions of Davison's poems before that time, one in 1608,<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> the
other in 1611.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> So that unless this poem was an after-insertion in
the 4th edit. it must have been written long before the death of
Sir Walter: perhaps it was composed soon after his condemnation
in 1603. See Oldys's <i>Life of Sir W. Raleigh</i>, p. 173, fol.</p>

<p>[Hallam asserted that this favourite poem had been ascribed
to Raleigh without evidence and without probability. Ritson
affirmed that F. Davison was the author, and Ellis supported the
claims of Joshua Sylvester, but Dr. Hannah has proved conclusively
that it was really written by Raleigh. It was certainly composed
before 1608, and probably about the period of its author's marriage
and his consequent imprisonment in the Tower. Dr. Hannah
has brought together a large amount of illustrative evidence in his
interesting edition of the <i>Courtly Poets</i> (1872), and he shows that
the answerers of the poem attributed it to Raleigh. One of the
answers commences as follows&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Go, echo of the mind, a careless truth protest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make answer that rude Rawly no stomach can digest."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He also draws attention to a transcript of the poem among the
Chetham MSS., made not long after Raleigh's death, and signed
"Wa. Raleigh."</p>

<p>In that remarkable book, <i>Sylvester's Remains</i>, printed at the end
of the translation of Du Bartas, 1641, <i>The Soules Errand</i> is inserted
with some poor additional verses.]</p></div>

VERSES BY KING JAMES I.</h3>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> the first edition of this book were inserted, by way of
specimen of his majesty's poetic talents, some Punning
Verses made on the disputations at Sterling: but it
having been suggested to the Editor, that the king only
gave the quibbling commendations in prose, and that some obsequious
court-rhymer put them into metre;<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> it was thought
proper to exchange them for two <i>Sonnets</i> of K. James's own
composition. James was a great versifier, and therefore out of
the multitude of his poems we have here selected two, which (to
shew our impartiality) are written in his best and his worst manner.
The first would not dishonour any writer of that time; the
second is a most complete example of the Bathos.</p>

K. JOHN AND THE ABBOT OF
CANTERBURY.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i303.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> common popular ballad of <i>King John and the Abbot</i>
seems to have been abridged and modernized about the
time of James I. from one much older, intitled, <i>King</i>
<i>John and the Bishop of Canterbury</i>. The Editor's folio
MS. contains a copy of this last, but in too corrupt a state to be
reprinted; it however afforded many lines worth reviving, which
will be found inserted in the ensuing stanzas.</p>

<p>The archness of the following questions and answers hath been
much admired by our old ballad-makers; for besides the two copies
above mentioned, there is extant another ballad on the same subject
(but of no great antiquity or merit), intitled, <i>King Olfrey and</i>
<i>the Abbot</i>.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> Lastly, about the time of the civil wars, when the cry
ran against the Bishops, some Puritan worked up the same story
into a very doleful ditty, to a solemn tune, concerning <i>King Henry</i>
<i>and a Bishop</i>, with this stinging moral:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Unlearned men hard matters out can find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When learned bishops princes eyes do blind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[All the copies of this ballad are of late date, but Mr. Chappell
says that the story upon which it is founded can be traced back to
the fifteenth century, and Dr. Rimbault so traces it to the <i>Adventures</i>
<i>of Howleglas</i>, printed in the Lower Saxon dialect in 1483. Wynkyn
de Worde printed in 1511 a collection of riddles translated from
the French, with the title <i>Demaundes Joyous</i>, which are like those
propounded by King John to the Abbot. Prof. Child points out
that by this link the ballad is connected with a tolerably large
literature of wit combats of the middle ages. (See <i>English and</i>
<i>Scottish Ballads</i>, vol. viii. p. 3.)</p>

<p>Copies of the puritan ballad referred to above are in the Pepys,
Douce, and Roxburghe collections. It commences as follows&mdash;</p></div>

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i312.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> little Sonnet was written by Sir <i>Henry Wotton</i>,
Knight, on that amiable Princess, Elizabeth daughter
of James I. and wife of the Elector Palatine, who
was chosen King of Bohemia, Sept. 5, 1619. The
consequences of this fatal election are well known: Sir Henry
Wotton, who in that and the following year was employed in
several embassies in Germany on behalf of this unfortunate lady,
seems to have had an uncommon attachment to her merit and
fortunes, for he gave away a jewel worth a thousand pounds, that
was presented to him by the Emperor, "because it came from an
enemy to his royal mistress the Queen of Bohemia." See <i>Biog.</i>
<i>Britan</i>.</p>

<p>This song is printed from the <i>Reliqui&aelig; Wottonian&aelig;</i>, 1651, with
some corrections from an old MS. copy.</p>

<p>[This elegant little poem in praise of the Queen of Bohemia
(who was called by those who knew her and were won by her
sweetness, spirit, wit, and unselfishness&mdash;the Queen of Hearts) has
been very frequently reprinted. The unfortunate princess was
also named the <i>Snow Queen</i> and her husband the <i>Winter King</i>,
in allusion to the fact that their reign at Prague only lasted one
winter. The poem first appeared, according to Dr. Rimbault, in
"The Sixt Set of Bookes, wherein are Anthemes for Versus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Chorus of 5 and 6 Parts; apt for Violls and Voyces: newly composed
by Michaell Est, Bachelor of Musicke, and Master of the
Choristers of the Cathedrall Church in Litchfield," London, 1624,
4to. It is printed in <i>Wit's Recreations</i>, 1640, and <i>Wit's Interpreter</i>,
1671, and in "Songs and Fancies to severall Musicall parts,
both apt for Voices and Viols," Aberdeen, 1682. Alterations
were made in the various copies, and in the latter book a wretched
second part, quite out of harmony with the original, was added.
It has found its way, with some variations, among Montrose's poems
(see Napier's <i>Life of Montrose</i>, 1856, <i>Appendix</i>, p. xl.), and Robert
Chambers (ignorant of the Englishman Sir Henry Wotton's claim
to the authorship) actually printed it in his <i>Scottish Songs</i> (vol. ii.
p. 631) as if "written by Darnley in praise of the beauty of Queen
Mary before their marriage."</p>

<p>Percy, while copying from the <i>Reliqui&aelig; Wottonian&aelig;</i>, 1651,
transposed stanzas 2 and 3. In Abp. Sancroft's MS. (Tanner, 465,

THE OLD AND YOUNG COURTIER.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i314.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> excellent old song, the subject of which is a comparison
between the manners of the old gentry, as still
subsisting in the times of Elizabeth, and the modern
refinements affected by their sons in the reigns of her
successors, is given, with corrections, from an ancient black-letter
copy in the Pepys collection, compared with another printed among
some miscellaneous "poems and songs" in a book intitled, <i>Le</i>
<i>Prince d'amour</i>, or <i>The Prince of Love</i>, 1660, 8vo.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This was one of the most popular of old songs, and Dr. King
in his Preface to the <i>Art of Cookery</i> places it by the side of <i>Chevy</i>
<i>Chase</i> as one of the ballads to be hung up over the carved mantelpiece
in the homes of old British hospitality. It is to be found in
broadside in nearly all the collections, and appears to have been
printed for the first time in the reign of James I. by T. Symcocke.
Pepys notices it in his <i>Diary</i> under the date 16th June, 1668&mdash;"Come
to Newbery, and there dined&mdash;and musick: a song of the
old Courtier of Queen Elizabeth's, and how he was changed upon
the coming in of the King, did please me mightily, and I did cause
W. Hewer to write it out."</p>

<p>The song was parodied and altered into many forms. About
the middle of the last century it was revived and sung by Mr.
Vernon in Shadwell's comedy, <i>The Squire of Alsatia</i>, with a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
burden, "moderation and alteration," and finally it has been again
revived in the present century, with still greater alterations, under
the title of <i>The Old English Gentleman</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Chappell has the following note on the object of the song:&mdash;"Southey
remarks very justly on the complaints of the decay of
hospitality, that 'while rents were received in kind they must
have been chiefly consumed in kind; at least there could be no
accumulation of disposable wealth.' He supposes this mode of
payment to have fallen generally into disuse during the reign of
James I. Without doubt, many of the poor would feel the
change." <i>Popular Music of the Olden Time</i>, vol. ii. p. 778.]</p></div>

SIR JOHN SUCKLING'S CAMPAIGNE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i318.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">When</span> the Scottish covenanters rose up in arms, and
advanced to the English borders in 1639, many of
the courtiers complimented the king by raising forces
at their own expence. Among these none were more
distinguished than the gallant Sir John Suckling, who raised a
troop of horse, so richly accoutred, that it cost him <i>&pound;</i>12,000.
The like expensive equipment of other parts of the army, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the king remark, that "the Scots would fight stoutly, if it were but
for the Englishmen's fine cloaths." (Lloyd's <i>Memoirs</i>.) When
they came to action, the rugged Scots proved more than a match
for the fine shewy English: many of whom behaved remarkably
ill, and among the rest this splendid troop of Sir John Suckling's.</p>

<p>This humorous pasquil has been generally supposed to have
been written by Sir John, as a banter upon himself. Some of his
contemporaries however attributed it to Sir John Mennis, a wit of
those times, among whose poems it is printed in a small poetical
miscellany, intitled, <i>Musarum delici&aelig;: or the Muses recreation,</i>
<i>containing several pieces of poetique wit</i>, 2d edition.&mdash;By Sir J. M.
(<i>Sir John Mennis</i>) and Ja. S. (<i>James Smith</i>.) Lond. 1656, 12mo.&mdash;(See
Wood's <i>Athen&aelig;</i>. ii. 397, 418.) In that copy is subjoined an
additional stanza, which probably was written by this Sir John
Mennis, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But now there is peace, he's return'd to increase<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His money, which lately he spent-a,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his lost honour must lye still in the dust;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At Barwick away it went-a."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This song is a parody of the famous old song, <i>John Dory</i>, commencing.&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As it fell on a holiday<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And upon a holytide-a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John Dory bought him an ambling nag<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To Paris for to ride-a."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Suckling's satirical powers made him peculiarly odious to the
Parliamentarians, as they were turned against them, and consequently
Mennis's lampoon was a great favourite with the Roundheads.
In <i>Le Prince d'Amour</i>, 1660, there is a song <i>Upon Sir</i>
<i>John Suckling's 100 Horse</i>, and the following are two of the seven
stanzas of which it consists:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I tell thee, Jack, thou gav'st the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rare a present, that nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Could welcomer have been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred horse! beshrew my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a brave heroic part,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The like will scarce be seen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For ev'ry horse shall have on's back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man as valiant as Sir Jack,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Although not half so witty:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I did hear the other day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two tailors made seven run away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Good faith, the more's the pity."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The uniform adopted by Suckling for his troop consisted of a
white doublet, and scarlet coat and breeches, with a scarlet feather
in the bonnet. The men were vigorous, well mounted and armed,
and these famous 100 horsemen were considered to be the finest
sight in his majesty's army. Mr. W. C. Hazlitt points out that the
earliest news of them appears to be in a letter of Jan. 29, 1638-9,
from the Earl of Northumberland to Lord Conway, in which the
writer speaks of Suckling having then engaged himself to raise the
troop "within these three days." (<i>Calendar of State Papers</i> (<i>Domestic</i>,)
1638-9, p. 378.) The army was badly commanded, and no
greater disgrace attached to Suckling's troop than to the rest.]</p></div>

TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON.</h3>

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i321.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> excellent sonnet, which possessed a high degree of
fame among the old Cavaliers, was written by Colone,
Richard Lovelace during his confinement in the gatehouse,
Westminster: to which he was committed by the
House of Commons, in April 1642, for presenting a petition from
the county of Kent, requesting them to restore the king to his
rights, and to settle the government. See Wood's <i>Athen&aelig;</i>, vol. ii.
p. 228, and Lysons' <i>Environs of London</i>, vol. i. p. 109; where may
be seen at large the affecting story of this elegant writer, who after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>having been distinguished for every gallant and polite accomplishment,
the pattern of his own sex, and the darling of the ladies, died
in the lowest wretchedness, obscurity, and want, in 1658.</p>

<p>This song is printed from a scarce volume of his poems intitled,
<i>Lucasta</i>, 1649, 12mo. collated with a copy in the Editor's folio
MS.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[As Percy mentions, the folio MS. collations have been added
from it (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 17), but it will at once
be seen that they are of little value. The music to this most
exquisite of prison songs was composed by the celebrated Dr. John
Wilson, and first printed (according to Dr. Rimbault) in his <i>Cheerful</i>
<i>Ayres or Ballads set for three Voices</i>, Oxford, 1660.</p>

<p>Lucasta (= Lux casta, Lucy Sacheverell), misled by a report that
Lovelace had died of his wounds received at Dunkirk while commanding
a regiment of his own forming in the service of the
French king, married another lover.</p>

<p>Although doubtless Lovelace died in great trouble, we may
hope that Wood's account of his extreme poverty is exaggerated,
for his daughter and sole heir married the son of Lord Chief Justice
Coke, and brought to her husband the estates of her father at
Kingsdown in Kent.]</p></div>

THE DOWNFALL OF CHARING-CROSS.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i323.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Charing</span>-Cross, as it stood before the civil wars, was
one of those beautiful Gothic obelisks erected to conjugal
affection by Edward I., who built such a one
wherever the herse of his beloved Eleanor rested in
its way from Lincolnshire to Westminster. But neither its ornamental
situation, the beauty of its structure, nor the noble design
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>of its erection (which did honour to humanity), could preserve it
from the merciless zeal of the times: For, in 1647, it was demolished
by order of the House of Commons, as popish and
superstitious. This occasioned the following not unhumorous
sarcasm, which has been often printed among the popular sonnets
of those times.</p>

<p>The plot referred to in ver. 17, was that entered into by Mr.
Waller the poet, and others, with a view to reduce the city and
tower to the service of the king; for which two of them, Nath.
Tomkins and Rich. Chaloner, suffered death July 5, 1643. Vid.
<i>Ath. Ox.</i> ii. 24.</p>

<p>Whitlocke says, "May 3, 1643, Cheapside cross and other
crosses were voted down," &amp;c.&mdash;But this Vote was not put in
execution with regard to <i>Charing Cross</i> till four years after, as
appears from Lilly's <i>Observations on the Life, &amp;c. of K. Charles</i>,
viz. "Charing-Cross, we know, was pulled down, 1647, in June,
July, and August. Part of the Stones were converted to pave
before Whitehall. I have seen Knife-hafts made of some of the
stones, which, being well-polished, looked like marble." Ed, 1715,
p. 18, 12mo.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[In Laud's Diary it is written, "1643 Maii 2 Tuesday The
cross in Cheapside taken down."]</p></div>

<p>See an Account of the pulling down Cheapside Cross, in the
Supplement to <i>Gent. Mag.</i> 1764.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Charing Cross was the largest and most beautiful of the series
of Eleanor crosses, and the architects employed in the construction
of it were paid <i>&pound;</i>450. The work was formerly attributed to
Cavalini, but that artist was not born until the year 1279, and
was therefore about eleven years old when the Queen died. Since
the publication of the very interesting rolls of payments made by the
executors of Queen Eleanor (<i>Manners and Household Expenses of</i>
<i>England in the 13th and 15th centuries.</i> Roxburghe Club, 1841),
it has been known that Charing Cross was commenced by Richard
de Crundale and completed, after his death, by Roger de Crundale.</p>

<p>The site of the old cross was made use of as a place of execution,
and several of the regicides were put to death there.</p>

<p>The Cheapside cross, which was taken down in 1643, was the
third which occupied the site, and it had only been erected in 1600.
The original cross was found to be in a bad condition in 1441,
and a new one was therefore commenced, which was not finished
until 1486. This was replaced in 1600 by the third cross.</p>

<p>Dr. Rimbault informs us that this ballad is printed with the
music for three voices by "Mr. F. Farmeloe" in "The Second
Book of the <i>Pleasant Musical Companion</i>," 1687.]</p></div>

VERSES BY K. CHARLES I.</h3>

</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">"This</span> prince, like his father, did not confine himself to
prose: Bishop Burnet has given us a pathetic elegy,
said to be written by Charles in Carisbrook castle (in
1648). The poetry is most uncouth and unharmonious,
but there are strong thoughts in it, some good sense, and a strain
of majestic piety." Mr. Walpole's <i>Royal and Noble Authors</i>, vol. i.</p>

<p>It is in his <i>Memoirs of the Duke of Hamilton</i>, p. 379, that Burnet
hath preserved this elegy, which he tells us he had from a gentleman,
who waited on the king at the time when it was written, and
copied it out from the original. It is there intitled, <i>Majesty in</i>
<i>Misery: or An Imploration to the King of Kings</i>.</p>

<p>Hume hath remarked of these stanzas, "That the truth of the
sentiment, rather than the elegance of expression, renders them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
very pathetic." See his <i>Hist.</i> 1763, 4to. vol. v. pp. 437, 442,
which is no bad comment upon them.&mdash;These are almost the only
verses known of Charles's composition. Indeed a little Poem
<i>On a quiet Conscience</i>, printed in the <i>Poetical Calendar</i>, 1763,
vol. viii. is attributed to <i>K. Charles I.</i>; being reprinted from a
thin 8vo. published by Nahum Tate, called <i>Miscellanea Sacra, or</i>
<i>Poems on Divine and Moral Subjects</i>.</p>

WHY SO PALE?</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i343f.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">From</span> Sir John Suckling's <i>Poems</i>. This sprightly knight
was born in 1613, and cut off by a fever about the 29th
year of his age. See above, Song IX. of this Book.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This celebrated song occurs in the tragedy of <i>Aglaura</i>, where it
is sung by Orsames, a young lord, who says&mdash;"It is a little foolish
counsel I gave a friend of mine four or five years ago when he was
falling into a consumption."</p>

<p>Dr. Rimbault (<i>Musical Illustrations</i>, p. 29) writes, "The original
air is here given from a MS. volume of old songs with the music,
<i>temp.</i> Charles II. in the collection of the Editor. It was originally
in the Library at Staunton Harold, Leicestershire, the seat of Earl
Ferrers. This beautiful lyric was sung by Mrs. Cross in the <i>Mock</i>
<i>Astrologer</i>, to an air composed by Lewis Ramondon. It was
afterwards reset by Dr. Arne."</p>

<p>The date of the poet's birth given above is incorrect. Suckling
was baptized on the tenth of February, 1608-9, and his mother
died in 1613. Reduced in fortune and an alien, he died of poison
bought by him of an apothecary at Paris. The date of his death
is not known, but it probably took place in 1641, and he certainly
was dead before the year 1642 had ended.]</p></div>

OLD TOM OF BEDLAM.</h3>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">Mad song the First.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i344.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> is worth attention, that the English have more songs
and ballads on the subject of madness, than any of
their neighbours. Whether there be any truth in the
insinuation, that we are more liable to this calamity
than other nations, or that our native gloominess hath peculiarly
recommended subjects of this cast to our writers; we certainly do
not find the same in the printed collections of French, Italian
Songs, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Out of a much larger quantity, we have selected half a dozen
<i>mad songs</i> for these volumes. The three first are originals in
their respective kinds; the merit of the three last is chiefly that
of imitation. They were written at considerable intervals of time;
but we have here grouped them together, that the reader may the
better examine their comparative merits. He may consider them
as so many trials of skill in a very peculiar subject, as the contest
of so many rivals to shoot in the bow of Ulysses. The two first
were probably written about the beginning of the last century; the
third about the middle of it; the fourth and sixth towards the
end; and the fifth within this present century.</p>

<p>This is given from the Editor's folio MS. compared with two
or three old printed copies.&mdash;With regard to the author of this old
rhapsody, in Walton's <i>Compleat Angler</i>, cap. 3, is a song in praise
of angling, which the author says was made at his request "by
Mr. <i>William Basse</i>, one that has made the choice songs of the
<i>Hunter in his career</i>, and of <i>Tom of Bedlam</i>, and many others
of note," p. <a href="#Page_84">84</a>. See Sir <i>John Hawkins's</i> curious Edition, 8vo. of
that excellent old book.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>[The madness here referred to was sometimes real, but more
often shammed. These "mad rascals" were so numerous a class
that they obtained the distinctive names of Bedlam beggars, and
Abraham men. Dekker describes their tricks in his <i>Bellman of</i>
<i>London</i>, 1616, where he says, "he calls himself by the name of
<i>Poor Tom</i>, and coming near any body, cries out, 'Poor Tom is a
cold;'" the very expression used by Edgar when he appears in
the disguise of a madman (<i>King Lear</i>). Mr. Chappell observes
that there is great uncertainty as to the authorship, for there are so
many Tom of Bedlam songs that it is impossible to determine from
the passage in the <i>Complete Angler</i> to which of them Walton refers.
It is also doubtful to whom we are indebted for the tune. Mr.
Chappell thinks that probably it was by Henry Lawes's master, John
Cooper, called Cuperario after his visit to Italy. It has been
attributed, without authority, to Henry Purcell and Henry Lawes.]</p></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i347.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Was</span> written about the beginning of the seventeenth century
by the witty bishop Corbet, and is printed from
the 3d edition of his Poems, 12mo. 1672, compared
with a more ancient copy in the Editor's folio MS.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This song was printed in <i>Le Prince d'Amour</i>, 1660, with three
other songs entitled <i>Tom of Bedlam</i>. It was also printed in the
<i>Rump Songs</i>, 1662, but not in the edition of 1660.</p>

<p>The copy in the folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. iii.
p. 269) has several alterations. Stanza 5 was taken by Percy
from the MS., where it occurs as stanza 8.</p>

<p>Richard Corbet, successively Bishop of Oxford and Norwich,
was born at Ewell in Surrey in 1582. He died in 1635. He was
a humorous man, and many pleasant stories are told of him, but
Aubrey describes his appearance as "grave and venerable."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_867_867" id="Footnote_867_867"></a><a href="#FNanchor_867_867"><span class="label">[867]</span></a> Emanuel college, Cambridge, was originally a seminary of
Puritans.
</p>
<p>
[Fuller has left us the following anecdote of Sir Walter Mildmay,
the founder of Emanuel, in his <i>History of the University of Cambridge</i>.
"Coming to court after he had founded his college, the queen told
him, 'Sir Walter, I hear you have erected a Puritan foundation.'
'No madam,' saith he, 'far be it from me to countenance anything
contrary to your established laws; but I have set an acorn,
which, when it becomes an oak, God alone knows what will be the
fruit thereof.'"]</p></div>

or, if the date of this song would permit, one might suppose it
aimed at one <i>Coppe</i>, a strange enthusiast, whose life may be seen
in Wood's <i>Athen.</i> vol. ii. p. 501. He was author of a book, intitled,
<i>The Fiery Flying Roll</i>: and afterwards published a Recantation,
part of whose title is, <i>The Fiery Flying Roll's Wings</i>

<i>A sweet Comfort for an afflicted Conscience</i>.
</p>
<p>
[Richard Greenham was born <i>circa</i> 1531 and died in 1591. He
was a singularly ardent preacher, and Brook, in his <i>Lives of the</i>
<i>Puritans</i>, says, that "in addition to his public ministerial labours
he had a remarkable talent for comforting afflicted consciences."
His <i>Works</i> were first collected in 1599.]</p></div>

half sheet folded, containing, <i>A survey, or table, declaring the order</i>
<i>of the causes of salvation and damnation, &amp;c.</i> the pedigree of damnation
being distinguished by a broad black zig-zag line.
</p>
<p>
[William Perkins (1558-1602). Brook says of him, that he used
to pronounce the word <i>damn</i> with so peculiar an emphasis "that it
left a doleful echo in the eares a long time after." His works were
frequently reprinted, and, according to Fuller, were translated into
Latin, French, Dutch, and Spanish.]</p></div>

LILLI BURLERO.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i358t.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> following rhymes, slight and insignificant as they
may now seem, had once a more powerful effect than
either the Philippics of Demosthenes, or Cicero; and
contributed not a little towards the great revolution in
1688. Let us hear a contemporary writer.</p>

<p>"A foolish ballad was made at that time, treating the Papists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
and chiefly the Irish, in a very ridiculous manner, which had a
burden said to be Irish words, <i>Lero, lero, liliburlero</i>, that made an
impression on the (king's) army, that cannot be imagined by those
that saw it not. The whole army, and at last the people, both in
city and country, were singing it perpetually. And perhaps never
had so slight a thing so great an effect."&mdash;<i>Burnet.</i></p>

<p>It was written, or at least republished, on the earl of Tyrconnel's
going a second time to Ireland in October, 1688. Perhaps it is
unnecessary to mention, that General Richard Talbot, newly
created earl of Tyrconnel, had been nominated by K. James II.
to the lieutenancy of Ireland in 1686, on account of his being a
furious papist, who had recommended himself to his bigotted
master by his arbitrary treatment of the protestants in the preceding
year, when only lieutenant general, and whose subsequent
conduct fully justified his expectations and their fears. The violences
of his administration may be seen in any of the histories of
those times: particularly in bishop King's <i>State of the Protestants</i>
<i>in Ireland</i>, 1691, 4to.</p>

<p>This song is attributed to Lord <i>Wharton</i> in a small pamphlet,
intitled, <i>A true relation of the several facts and circumstances of the</i>
<i>intended riot and tumult on Q. Elizabeth's birth-day, &amp;c.</i> 3d. ed.
Lond. 1712, pr. 2<i>d.</i>&mdash;See p. <a href="#Page_5">5</a>, viz.&mdash;"A late Viceroy (of Ireland,)
who has so often boasted himself upon his talent for mischief
invention, lying, and for making a certain <i>Lilliburlero Song</i>; with
which, if you will believe himself, he sung a deluded Prince out
of Three Kingdoms."</p>

<p><i>Lilliburlero</i> and <i>Bullen-a-lah</i> are said to have been the words of
distinction used among the Irish Papists in their massacre of the
Protestants in 1641.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[To no song could be better attributed Fletcher of Saltoun's
dictum than to this poor specimen of verse, which caught the fancy
of the people and drove James from his throne. Macaulay wrote
of it as follows:&mdash;"From one end of England to the other all
classes were constantly singing this idle rhyme. It was especially
the delight of the English army. More than seventy years after the
Revolution, Sterne delineated with exquisite skill a veteran who
had fought at the Boyne and at Namur. One of the characteristics
of the good old soldier is his trick of whistling <i>Lilliburlero</i>." The
air is attributed to Purcell, but it is supposed that he only arranged
an earlier tune. Hume thought that the popularity of the song
was rather due to the composer of the air than to the author of
the words.</p>

<p>Mr. Markland, in a note to Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>, says, that
"according to Lord Dartmouth there was a particular expression
in it, which the king remembered that he had made use of to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
Earl of Dorset, from whence it was concluded that he was the
author." Upon this Mr. Chappell remarks, 1. that "the Earl of
Dorset laid no claim to it, and it is scarcely to be believed that
the author of <i>To all you ladies now on land</i> could have penned
such thorough doggrel." 2. That "the ballad contains no expression
that the King would have used, which might not equally
have been employed by any other person."<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> There can now be
little doubt that the author was Thomas Marquis of Wharton,
father of the mad Duke Philip of Wharton. He discerned the
indications of the political horizon and espoused the winning side.
He was well rewarded for his wisdom. Mr. S. Redmond (<i>Notes</i>
<i>and Queries</i>, third series, viii. 13) writes that he has often heard
the girls in the south and south-east of Ireland, while engaged in
binding the corn into sheaves after the reapers, sing the following
chorus, which always had reference to one of the gang who was
not so quick at her work as the others, and who consequently was
left behind:</p></div>

THE BRAES OF YARROW,</h3>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">In Imitation of the Ancient Scots Manner</span>,
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i362.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Was</span> written by William Hamilton, of Bangour, Esq; who
died March 25, 1734, aged 50. It is printed from an
elegant edition of his <i>Poems</i>, published at Edinburgh,
1760, 12mo. This song was written in imitation of an
old Scottish ballad on a similar subject, with the same burden to
each stanza.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The beautiful river Yarrow has few rivals as an inspirer of song.
These verses of Hamilton's are copied from the old ballad&mdash;<i>The</i>
<i>Dowie Dens</i> (melancholy downs) <i>of Yarrow</i>, a collated version of
which was first printed by Scott in his <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish</i>
<i>Border</i>. Scott was of opinion that with many readers the greatest
recommendation of the old ballad will be that it suggested to
Hamilton his modern one. We may say that the greatest recommendation
of Hamilton's poem to us is the fact that it inspired
Wordsworth to write his three lovely little poems, <i>Yarrow Unvisited</i>,
<i>Visited</i>, and <i>Revisited</i>.</p>

<p>There are two old ballads which have been much mixed up by
reciters, viz. <i>The Dowie Dens</i> and <i>Willie's drowned in Yarrow</i>.
The Rev. John Logan's <i>Braes of Yarrow</i> is founded on the latter.</p>

<p>William Hamilton of Bangour was born in 1704 and died at
Lyons in 1754, from which place his remains were brought to
Scotland, and interred in Holyrood Abbey. He was a Jacobite,
and after the battle of Culloden was forced to skulk about the
Highlands in disguise until he was able to escape to France. He
returned to Scotland after the country had quieted down in 1749.]</p></div>

ADMIRAL HOSIER'S GHOST</h3>

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Was</span> a party song written by the ingenious author of
<i>Leonidas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> on the taking of Porto Bello from the Spaniards
by Admiral Vernon, Nov. 22, 1739.&mdash;The case
of Hosier, which is here so pathetically represented,
was briefly this. In April, 1726, that commander was sent with a
strong fleet into the Spanish West-Indies, to block up the galleons
in the ports of that country, or should they presume to come out,
to seize and carry them into England: he accordingly arrived at
the Bastimentos near Porto Bello, but being employed rather to
overawe than to attack the Spaniards, with whom it was probably
not our interest to go to war, he continued long inactive on that
station, to his own great regret. He afterwards removed to Carthagena,
and remained cruizing in these seas, till far the greater part
of his men perished deplorably by the diseases of that unhealthy
climate. This brave man, seeing his best officers and men thus
daily swept away, his ships exposed to inevitable destruction, and
himself made the sport of the enemy, is said to have died of a
broken heart. Such is the account of Smollett, compared with
that of other less partial writers.</p>

<p>The following song is commonly accompanied with a Second
Part, or Answer, which being of inferior merit, and apparently
written by another hand, hath been rejected.</p>

<p>[Dr. Rimbault (<i>Musical Illustrations</i>, p. 30) writes: "The earliest
copy of the tune to this ballad is contained in the ballad opera of
<i>Sylvia, or the Country Burial</i>, 1731. It may also be found in
Walsh's <i>British Musical Miscellany</i>, vol. iv. and in other works of
a similar description. The ballads of <i>Come and listen to my ditty</i>
and <i>Cease, rude Boreas</i>, were sung to this tune, which appears to
have been always a favourite for 'sea ditties.'"</p>

<p>In Hannah More's <i>Life</i> (vol. i. p. 405) is the following interesting
note: "I was much amused with hearing old Leonidas Glover
sing his own fine ballad of <i>Hosier's Ghost</i>, which was very affecting.
He is past eighty." In the matter of the last item Mrs. More was
wrong. Richard Glover was born in 1712, and died on Nov. 25,
1785.]</p></div>

who was hanged, drawn, and quartered, on Kennington-common,
in the county of Surrey, July 30, 1746.&mdash;This
ballad is founded on a remarkable fact, which was
reported to have happened at his execution. It was written by
the late <i>William Shenstone</i>, Esq; soon after the event, and has
been printed amongst his posthumous works, 2 vols. 8vo. It is
here given from a MS. which contained some small variations from
that printed copy.</p>

<p>[Captain James Dawson was one of eight officers belonging to
the Manchester regiment of Volunteers in the service of the young
Chevalier, who were executed on Kennington Common.</p>

<p>The following ballad is founded upon a narrative first published
in a periodical entitled <i>The Parrot</i>, Saturday, 2d August, 1746,
three days after the occurrence. In the <i>Whitehall Evening Post</i>,
Aug. 7, 1746, the same story is told with the addition, that "upon
enquiry every circumstance was literally true." Another ballad is
said to have been written upon Dawson's fate, and sung about the
streets. It is reprinted in the <i>European Magazine</i>, April, 1801,
p. 248, and begins as follows:</p></div>

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">We</span> learn from Wormius<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>, that the ancient
Islandic poets used a great variety of
measures: he mentions 136 different
kinds, without including rhyme, or a
correspondence of final syllables, yet this was occasionally
used, as appears from the Ode of Egil,
which Wormius hath inserted in his book.</p>

<p>He hath analysed the structure of one of these
kinds of verse, the harmony of which neither depended
on the quantity of the syllables, like that of
the ancient Greeks and Romans; nor on the rhymes
at the end, as in modern poetry; but consisted altogether
in alliteration, or a certain artful repetition
of the sounds in the middle of the verses. This was
adjusted according to certain rules of their prosody,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>one of which was, that every distich should contain
at least three words beginning with the same letter
or sound. Two of these correspondent sounds might
be placed either in the first or second line of the
distich, and one in the other: but all three were not
regularly to be crowded into one line. This will be
best understood by the following examples<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>M</i>eire og <i>M</i>inne<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>M</i>ogu heimdaller."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"<i>G</i>ab <i>G</i>inuga<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enn <i>G</i>ras huerge."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There were many other little niceties observed by
the Islandic poets, who, as they retained their original
language and peculiarities longer than the other
nations of Gothic race, had time to cultivate their
native poetry more, and to carry it to a higher pitch
of refinement, than any of the rest.</p>

<p>Their brethren, the Anglo-Saxon poets, occasionally
used the same kind of alliteration, and it is
common to meet, in their writings, with similar
examples of the foregoing rules. Take an instance
or two in modern characters<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Sk</i>yppend ure."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>H</i>am and <i>H</i>eahsetl<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>H</i>eofena rikes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I know not, however, that there is anywhere extant
an entire Saxon poem all in this measure. But distichs
of this sort perpetually occur in all their poems
of any length.</p>

<p>Now if we examine the versification of Pierce
Plowman's <i>Visions</i>, we shall find it constructed exactly
by these rules; and therefore each line, as
printed, is in reality a distich of two verses, and will,
I believe, be found distinguished as such, by some
mark or other in all the ancient MSS. viz.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In a <i>S</i>omer <i>S</i>eason, | when 'hot'<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> was the <i>S</i>unne,<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>W</i>ent <i>W</i>yde in thys world | <i>W</i>onders to heare, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So that the author of this poem will not be found to
have invented any new mode of versification, as
some have supposed, but only to have retained that
of the old Saxon and Gothic poets; which was probably
never wholly laid aside, but occasionally used
at different intervals: though the ravages of time will
not suffer us now to produce a regular series of poems
entirely written in it.</p>

<p>There are some readers whom it may gratify to
mention, that these <i>Visions of Pierce</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Peter) <i>the</i>
<i>Plowman</i>, are attributed to Robert Langland, a
secular priest, born at Mortimer's Cleobury in Shropshire,
and fellow of Oriel College in Oxford, who
flourished in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard
II., and published his poem a few years after 1350.
It consists of xx. <i>passus</i> or breaks<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>, exhibiting
a series of visions which, he pretends, happened to
him on Malvern hills in Worcestershire. The author
excells in strong allegoric painting, and has with
great humour, spirit, and fancy, censured most of the
vices incident to the several professions of life; but
he particularly inveighs against the corruptions of
the clergy, and the absurdities of superstition. Of
this work I have now before me four different
editions in black-letter quarto. Three of them are
printed in 1550, "by Robert Crowley, dwelling in Elye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>Rentes in Holburne." It is remarkable that two of
these are mentioned in the title-page as both of the
second impression, though they contain evident
variations in every page<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>. The other is said to
be "newlye imprynted after the authors olde copy ...
by Owen Rogers," Feb. 21, 1561.</p>

<p>As Langland was not the first, so neither was he
the last that used this alliterative species of versification.
To Rogers's edition of the <i>Visions</i> is subjoined
a poem, which was probably writ in imitation
of them, intitled <i>Pierce the Ploughman's Crede</i>. It
begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>C</i>ros, and <i>C</i>urteis <i>C</i>hrist, this beginning spede<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the <i>F</i>aders <i>F</i>rendshipe, that <i>F</i>ourmed heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the <i>Sp</i>ecial <i>Sp</i>irit, that <i>Sp</i>rong of hem tweyne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And al in one godhed endles dwelleth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The author feigns himself ignorant of his Creed, to
be instructed in which he applies to the four religious
orders, viz., the gray friers of St. Francis, the black
friers of St. Dominic, the Carmelites or white friers,
and the Augustines. This affords him occasion to describe
in very lively colours the sloth, ignorance, and
immorality of those reverend drones. At length he
meets with Pierce, a poor ploughman, who resolves
his doubts, and instructs him in the principles of
true religion. The author was evidently a follower
of Wiccliff, whom he mentions (with honour) as no
longer living<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>. Now that reformer died in 1384.
How long after his death this poem was written,
does not appear.</p>

<p>In the Cotton library is a volume of ancient English
poems<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>, two of which are written in this
alliterative metre, and have the division of the lines
into distichs distinctly marked by a point, as is usual
in old poetical MSS. That which stands first of the
two (though perhaps the latest written) is entitled
<i>The Sege of I'erlam</i>, (<i>i.e.</i> Jerusalem), being an old
fabulous legend composed by some monk, and stuffed
with marvellous figments concerning the destruction
of the holy city and temple. It begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The other is intitled <i>Chevalere Assigne</i> (or De
Cigne), that is, <i>The Knight of the Swan</i>, being an
ancient Romance, beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Among Mr. Garrick's collection of old plays<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> is a
prose narrative of the adventures of this same Knight
of the Swan, "newly translated out of Frenshe
into Englyshe, at thinstigacion of the puyssaunt and
illustryous prynce, lorde Edward duke of Buckynghame."
This lord it seems had a peculiar interest
in the book, for, in the preface, the translator tells us,
that this "highe dygne and illustryous prynce my
lorde Edwarde by the grace of god Duke of Buckyngham,
erle of Hereforde, Stafforde, and Northampton,
desyrynge cotydyally to encrease and

and to encourage and styre every lusty and gentell
herte by the exemplyficacyon of the same, havyng a

a famous and puyssaunt kynge, named Oryant,
sometime reynynge in the parties of beyonde the

conceyved sixe sonnes and a daughter, and chylded
of them at one only time; at whose byrthe echone of
them had a chayne of sylver at their neckes, the
whiche were all tourned by the provydence of god
into whyte swannes, save one, of the whiche this
present hystory is compyled, named Helyas, the
knight of the swanne, <i>of whome linially is dyscended</i>

While in Italy literature and the fine arts were ready
to burst forth with classical splendor under Leo X.

<p>To return to the metre of Pierce Plowman: In
the folio MS. so often quoted in these volumes, are
two poems written in that species of versification.
One of these is an ancient allegorical poem intitled
<i>Death and Life</i>, (in 2 fitts or parts, containing 458
distichs) which, for ought that appears, may have
been written as early, if not before, the time of
Langland. The first forty lines are broke as they
should be into distichs, a distinction that is neglected
in the remaining part of the transcript, in order, I
suppose, to save room. It begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Chr</i>ist <i>Chr</i>isten king,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">that on the <i>Cr</i>osse tholed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hadd <i>Pa</i>ines and <i>Pa</i>ssyons<br /></span>
<span class="i2">to defend our soules;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give us <i>Gr</i>ace on the <i>Gr</i>ound<br /></span>
<span class="i2">the <i>Gr</i>eatlye to serve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that <i>R</i>oyall <i>R</i>ed blood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">that <i>R</i>ann from thy side."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The subject of this piece is a vision, wherein the
poet sees a contest for superiority between "our
lady Dame Life," and the "ugly fiend Dame Death;"
who with their several attributes and concomitants
are personified in a fine vein of allegoric painting.
Part of the description of Dame Life is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shee was <i>B</i>righter of her <i>B</i>lee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">then was the <i>B</i>right sonn:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the <i>Gr</i>asse, that was <i>Gr</i>ay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Gr</i>eened belive."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Death is afterwards sketched out with a no less bold
and original pencil.</p>

<p>The other poem is that which is quoted in the 32nd
page of this volume, and which was probably the last
that was ever written in this kind of metre in its original
simplicity unaccompanied with rhyme. It
should have been observed above in page <a href="#Page_32">32</a>, that in
this poem the lines are throughout divided into distichs,
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Gr</i>ant <i>Gr</i>acious God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gr</i>ant me this time," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is intitled <i>Scottish Feilde</i> (in 2 fitts, 420 distichs,)
containing a very circumstantial narrative of the battle
of Flodden, fought Sept. 9, 1513: at which the author
seems to have been present from his speaking in the
first person plural:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then <i>we T</i>ild downe <i>our T</i>ents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">that <i>T</i>old were a thousand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the conclusion of the poem he gives this account
of himself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He was a <i>G</i>entleman by <i>J</i>esu,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The village of Bagily or Baguleigh is in Cheshire,
and had belonged to the ancient family of Legh for
two centuries before the battle of Flodden. Indeed
that the author was of that county appears from
other passages in the body of the poem, particularly
from the pains he takes to wipe off a stain
from the Cheshiremen, who it seems ran away in
that battle, and from his encomiums on the Stanleys,
earls of Derby, who usually headed that county.
He laments the death of James Stanley, bishop of
Ely, as what had recently happened when this poem
was written; which serves to ascertain its date, for
that prelate died March 22, 1514-5.</p>

<p>Thus have we traced the alliterative measure so
low as the sixteenth century. It is remarkable that
all such poets as used this kind of metre, retained
along with it many peculiar Saxon idioms, particularly
such as were appropriated to poetry: this deserves
the attention of those who are desirous to
recover the laws of the ancient Saxon poesy, usually
given up as inexplicable: I am of opinion that they
will find what they seek in the metre of Pierce
Plowman<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the sixteenth century this
kind of versification began to change its form: the
author of <i>Scottish Field</i>, we see, concludes his poem
with a couplet in rhyme: this was an innovation that
did but prepare the way for the general admission of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>that more modish ornament; till at length the old
uncouth verse of the ancient writers would no longer
go down without it. Yet when rhyme began to be
superadded, all the niceties of alliteration were at first
retained along with it; and the song of <i>Little John</i>
<i>Nobody</i> exhibits this union very clearly. By degrees
the correspondence of final sounds engrossing the
whole attention of the poet, and fully satisfying the
reader, the internal imbellishment of alliteration was
no longer studied, and thus was this kind of metre at
length swallowed up and lost in our common burlesque
Alexandrine, or Anapestic verse<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>, now never used
but in ballads and pieces of light humour, as in the
song of <i>Conscience</i>, and in that well-known doggerel,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A cobler there was, and he lived in a stall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But although this kind of measure hath with us
been thus degraded, it still retains among the French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>its ancient dignity; their grand heroic verse of twelve
syllables<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> is the same genuine offspring of the old
alliterative metre of the ancient Gothic and Francic
poets, stript like our Anapestic of its alliteration, and
ornamented with rhyme: but with this difference, that
whereas this kind of verse hath been applied by us
only to light and trivial subjects, to which by its
quick and lively measure it seemed best adapted, our
poets have let it remain in a more lax unconfined
state<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>, as a greater degree of severity and strictness
would have been inconsistent with the light and airy
subjects to which they have applied it. On the other
hand, the French having retained this verse as the
vehicle of their epic and tragic flights, in order to
give it a stateliness and dignity were obliged to confine
it to more exact laws of scansion: they have
therefore limited it to the number of twelve syllables;
and by making the c&aelig;sura or pause as full and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>distinct as possible, and by other severe restrictions,
have given it all the solemnity of which it was capable.
The harmony of both however depends so much on
the same flow of cadence and disposal of the pause,
that they appear plainly to be of the same original;
and every French heroic verse evidently consists of
the ancient distich of their Francic ancestors: which,
by the way, will account to us why this verse of the
French so naturally resolves itself into two complete
hemistics. And indeed by making the c&aelig;sura or
pause always to rest on the last syllable of a word,
and by making a kind of pause in the sense, the
French poets do in effect reduce their hemistics to
two distinct and independent verses: and some of
their old poets have gone so far as to make the two
hemistics rhyme to each other.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<p>After all, the old alliterative and anapestic metre
of the English poets being chiefly used in a barbarous
age, and in a rude unpolished language, abounds with
verses defective in length, proportion, and harmony;
and therefore cannot enter into a comparison with
the correct versification of the best modern French
writers; but making allowances for these defects, that
sort of metre runs with a cadence so exactly resembling
the French heroic Alexandrine, that I
believe no peculiarities of their versification can be
produced, which cannot be exactly matched in the
alliterative metre. I shall give by way of example a
few lines from the modern French poets accommodated
with parallels from the ancient poem of <i>Life</i>
<i>and Death</i>; in these I shall denote the c&aelig;sura or
pause by a perpendicular line, and the cadence by the
marks of the Latin quantity.</p>

</div></div>

<p>To conclude: the metre of Pierce Plowman's Visions
has no kind of affinity with what is commonly called
blank verse; yet has it a sort of harmony of its own,
proceeding not so much from its alliteration, as from
the artful disposal of its cadence, and the contrivance
of its pause; so that when the ear is a little accustomed
to it, it is by no means unpleasing; but claims
all the merit of the French heroic numbers, only
far less polished; being sweetened, instead of their
final rhymes, with the internal recurrence of similar
sounds.</p>

<p>The writer then gives a solemn lecture to kings on
the art of governing. From the demand of subsidies
"to susteyne his werres," I am inclined to believe this
poem composed in the reign of K. Henry V., as the
MS. appears from a subsequent entry to have been
written before the 9th of Henry VI. The whole
poem contains but 146 lines.</p>

<p>The alliterative metre was no less popular among
the old Scottish poets, than with their brethren on this
side the Tweed. In Maitland's collection of ancient
Scottish poems, MS. in the Pepysian library, is a
very long poem in this species of versification, thus
inscribed:</p>

<p>The Author pretends to overhear three gossips
sitting in an arbour, and revealing all their secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>methods of alluring and governing the other sex; it
is a severe and humorous satire on bad women, and
nothing inferior to Chaucer's Prologue to his <i>Wife of</i>
<i>Bath's Tale</i>. As Dunbar lived till about the middle of
the sixteenth century, this poem was probably composed
after <i>Scottish Field</i> (described above in p. <a href="#Page_384">384</a>),
which is the latest specimen I have met with written in
England. This poem contains about five hundred
lines.</p>

<p>But the current use of the alliterative metre in
Scotland, appears more particularly from those popular
vulgar prophecies, which are still printed for
the use of the lower people in Scotland, under the
names of Thomas the Rymer, Marvellous Merling,
&amp;c. This collection seems to have been put together
after the accession of James I. to the crown of England,
and most of the pieces in it are in the metre of
<i>Pierce Plowman's Visions</i>, The first of them begins
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Merling sayes in his book, who will <i>R</i>ead <i>R</i>ight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although his <i>S</i>ayings be uncouth, they <i>S</i>hall be true found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the seventh chapter, read <i>W</i>hoso <i>W</i>ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One thousand and more after Christ's birth, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the prophesie of Beid:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Betwixt the chief of <i>S</i>ummer and the <i>S</i>ad winter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the <i>H</i>eat of summer <i>H</i>appen shall a war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That <i>E</i>urop's lands <i>E</i>arnestly shall be wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>E</i>arnest <i>E</i>nvy shall last but a while, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So again the prophesie of Berlington:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When the <i>R</i>uby is <i>R</i>aised, <i>R</i>est is there none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But much <i>R</i>ancour shall <i>R</i>ise in <i>R</i>iver and plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much <i>S</i>orrow is <i>S</i>een through a <i>S</i>uth-hound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beares <i>H</i>ornes in his <i>H</i>ead like a wyld <i>H</i>art, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In like metre is the prophesie of Waldhave:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Upon <i>L</i>owdon <i>L</i>aw alone as I <i>L</i>ay,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For <i>M</i>alice and <i>M</i>elody that <i>M</i>oved me sore, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And lastly, that intitled the prophesie of Gildas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When holy kirk is <i>W</i>racked and <i>W</i>ill has no <i>W</i>it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>P</i>astors are <i>P</i>luckt, and <i>P</i>il'd without <i>P</i>ity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When <i>I</i>dolatry <i>I</i>s <i>I</i>n <i>ens</i> and <i>re</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spiritual pastours are vexed away, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It will be observed in the foregoing specimens,
that the alliteration is extremely neglected, except in
the third and fourth instances; although all the rest
are written in imitation of the cadence used in this
kind of metre. It may perhaps appear from an attentive
perusal, that the poems ascribed to Berlington
and Waldhave are more ancient than the others:
indeed the first and fifth appear evidently to have
been new modelled, if not intirely composed about
the beginning of the last century, and are probably
the latest attempts ever made in this species of verse.</p>

<p>In this and the foregoing essay are mentioned all
the specimens I have met with of the alliterative
metre without rhyme: but instances occur sometimes
in old manuscripts, of poems written both with
final rhymes and the internal cadence and alliterations
of the metre of Pierce Plowman.</p>

<p>This Essay will receive illustration from another
specimen in Warton's <i>History of English Poetry</i>,
vol. i. p. 309, being the fragment of a MS. poem on
the subject of <i>Alexander the Great</i>, in the Bodleian
Library, which he supposes to be the same with No.
44 in the Ashmol. MSS. containing twenty-seven
<i>passus</i>, and beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whener folk fastid [feasted, <i>qu.</i>] and fed, fayne wolde thei her [<i>i.e.</i> hear]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some farand thing, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>
<p>It is well observed by Mr. Tyrwhitt on Chaucer's
sneer at this old alliterative metre (vol. iii. p. 305),
viz.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;I am a Sotherne [<i>i.e.</i> Southern] man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot geste, rom, ram, raf, by my letter,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that the fondness for this species of versification, &amp;c.
was retained longest in the northern provinces: and
that the author of <i>Pierce Plowman's Visions</i> is in the
best MSS. called <i>William</i>, without any surname.
See vol. iv. p. 74.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The Rev. Walter W. Skeat, editor of <i>Piers Plowman</i>, for the
Early English Text Society, has written <i>An Essay on Alliterative</i>
<i>Poetry</i>, for Hales and Furnivall's edition of the Percy folio MS.,
which will be found in the third volume of that work (pp. xi.-xxxix.).
He gives a list of all the poems he has met with that have been
written as alliterative, yet without rhyme, since the Conquest, and
ends his essay with the following note:&mdash;"The reader must be
warned against three extraordinary mis-statements in this (Percy's)
essay, following close upon one another near the end of it. These
are (1) that Robert of Gloucester wrote in anap&aelig;stic verse, whereas
he wrote in the long Alexandrine verse, containing (when perfect)
six <i>Returns</i>; (2) that the French alone have retained this old
Gothic metre [the twelve-syllabled Alexandrine] for their serious
poems, whereas we may be sure that Michael Drayton, the author
of the Polyolbion, meant his poem seriously; and (3) that the
cadence of <i>Piers Plowman</i> 'so exactly resembles the French
Alexandrine, that I believe no peculiarities of their versification
can be produced which cannot be exactly matched in the alliterative
metre.' This is indeed a curious craze, for the alliterative
metre is founded on <i>Dominants</i>, the Alexandrine on <i>Returns</i>.
Percy gives some examples, and the metre which he selects for
numbering is the <i>French</i> one, as the reader may easily judge for
himself when he finds that the line</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>is marked by him as it is marked here, and is supposed to consist
of <i>four Anap&aelig;sts</i>! Yet one more blunder to be laid at the door
of the 'Anap&aelig;sts!' Would that we were well rid of them, and
that the 'longs' and 'shorts' were buried beside them."]</p></div>

rests upon every third syllable. This kind of verse, which I also
call the burlesque Alexandrine (to distinguish it from the other
Alexandrines of eleven and fourteen syllables, the parents of our
lyric measure: see examples, pp. 151, 152, &amp;c.), was early applied
by Robert of Gloucester to serious subjects. That writer's metre,
like this of Langland's, is formed on the Saxon models (each verse
of his containing a Saxon distich), only instead of the internal
alliterations adopted by Langland, he rather chose final rhymes, as
the French poets have done since. Take a specimen:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Saxons tho in ther power, tho thii were so rive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seve kingdoms made in Engelonde, and suthe but vive:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king of Northomberlond, and of Eastangle also,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Kent, and of Westsex, and of the March, therto."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Robert of Gloucester wrote in the western dialect, and his language
differs exceedingly from that of other contemporary writers, who
resided in the metropolis, or in the midland counties. Had the
Heptarchy continued, our English language would probably have
been as much distinguished for its different dialects as the Greek;
or at least as that of the several independent states of Italy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_901_901" id="Footnote_901_901"></a><a href="#FNanchor_901_901"><span class="label">[901]</span></a> Or of thirteen syllables, in what they call a feminine verse.
It is remarkable that the French alone have retained this old Gothic
metre for their serious poems; while the English, Spaniards, &amp;c.
have adopted the Italic verse of ten syllables, although the Spaniards,
as well as we, anciently used a short-lined metre. I believe
the success with which Petrarch, and perhaps one or two
others, first used the heroic verse of ten syllables in Italian poesy,
recommended it to the Spanish writers; as it also did to our
Chaucer, who first attempted it in English; and to his successors
Lord Surrey, Sir Thomas Wyat, &amp;c.; who afterwards improved it
and brought it to perfection. To Lord Surrey we also owe the first
introduction of blank verse in his versions of the second and
fourth Books of the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, 1557, 4to.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_902_902" id="Footnote_902_902"></a><a href="#FNanchor_902_902"><span class="label">[902]</span></a> Thus our poets use this verse indifferently with twelve,
eleven, and even ten syllables. For though regularly it consists
of four Anapests (&#728; &#728; &macr;) or twelve syllables, yet they frequently
retrench a syllable from the first or third Anapest; and sometimes
from both; as in these instances from <i>Prior</i>, and from the Song
of Conscience:

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
