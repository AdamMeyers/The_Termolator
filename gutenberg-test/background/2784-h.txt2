      CHAPTER I.
    
    
      It may be remembered that it was the habit of that gallant "war-horse" of
      the Calaveras democracy, Colonel Starbottle, at the close of a political
      campaign, to return to his original profession of the Law. Perhaps it
      could not be called a peaceful retirement. The same fiery-tongued
      eloquence and full-breasted chivalry which had in turns thrilled and
      overawed freemen at the polls were no less fervid and embattled before a
      jury. Yet the Colonel was counsel for two or three pastoral Ditch
      companies and certain bucolic corporations, and although he managed to
      import into the simplest question of contract more or less abuse of
      opposing counsel, and occasionally mingled precedents of law with
      antecedents of his adversary, his legal victories were seldom complicated
      by bloodshed. He was only once shot at by a free-handed judge, and twice
      assaulted by an over-sensitive litigant. Nevertheless, it was thought
      merely prudent, while preparing the papers in the well known case of "The
      Arcadian Shepherds' Association of Tuolumne versus the Kedron Vine and Fig
      Tree Growers of Calaveras," that the Colonel should seek with a shotgun
      the seclusion of his partner's law office in the sylvan outskirts of Rough
      and Ready for that complete rest and serious preoccupation which
      Marysville could not afford.
    
    
      It was an exceptionally hot day. The painted shingles of the plain wooden
      one-storied building in which the Colonel sat were warped and blistering
      in the direct rays of the fierce, untempered sun. The tin sign bearing the
      dazzling legend, "Starbottle and Bungstarter, Attorneys and Counselors,"
      glowed with an insufferable light; the two pine-trees still left in the
      clearing around the house, ineffective as shade, seemed only to have
      absorbed the day-long heat through every scorched and crisp twig and
      fibre, to radiate it again with the pungent smell of a slowly smouldering
      fire; the air was motionless yet vibrating in the sunlight; on distant
      shallows the half-dried river was flashing and intolerable.
    
    
      Seated in a wooden armchair before a table covered with books and papers,
      yet with that apparently haughty attitude towards it affected by gentlemen
      of abdominal fullness, Colonel Starbottle supported himself with one hand
      grasping the arm of his chair and the other vigorously plying a huge
      palm-leaf fan. He was perspiring freely. He had taken off his
      characteristic blue frock-coat, waistcoat, cravat, and collar, and,
      stripped only to his ruffled shirt and white drill trousers, presented the
      appearance from the opposite side of the table of having hastily risen to
      work in his nightgown. A glass with a thin sediment of sugar and
      lemon-peel remaining in it stood near his elbow. Suddenly a black shadow
      fell on the staring, uncarpeted hall. It was that of a stranger who had
      just entered from the noiseless dust of the deserted road. The Colonel
      cast a rapid glance at his sword-cane, which lay on the table.
    
    
      But the stranger, although sallow and morose-looking, was evidently of
      pacific intent. He paused on the threshold in a kind of surly
      embarrassment.
    
    
      "I reckon this is Colonel Starbottle," he said at last, glancing gloomily
      round him, as if the interview was not entirely of his own seeking. "Well,
      I've seen you often enough, though you don't know me. My name's Jo Corbin.
      I guess," he added, still discontentedly, "I have to consult you about
      something."
    
    
      "Corbin?" repeated the Colonel in his jauntiest manner. "Ah! Any relation
      to old Maje Corbin of Nashville, sir?"
    
    
      "No," said the stranger briefly. "I'm from Shelbyville."
    
    
      "The Major," continued the Colonel, half closing his eyes as if to follow
      the Major into the dreamy past, "the old Major, sir, a matter of five or
      six years ago, was one of my most intimate political friends,&mdash;in
      fact, sir, my most intimate friend. Take a chyar!"
    
    
      But the stranger had already taken one, and during the Colonel's
      reminiscence had leaned forward, with his eyes on the ground,
      discontentedly swinging his soft hat between his legs. "Did you know Tom
      Frisbee, of Yolo?" he asked abruptly.
    
    
      "Er&mdash;no."
    
    
      "Nor even heard anything about Frisbee, nor what happened to him?"
      continued the man, with aggrieved melancholy.
    
    
      In point of fact the Colonel did not think that he had.
    
    
      "Nor anything about his being killed over at Fresno?" said the stranger,
      with a desponding implication that the interview after all was a failure.
    
    
      "If&mdash;er&mdash;if you could&mdash;er&mdash;give me a hint or two,"
      suggested the Colonel blandly.
    
    
      "There wasn't much," said the stranger, "if you don't remember." He
      paused, then rising, he gloomily dragged his chair slowly beside the
      table, and taking up a paperweight examined it with heavy dissatisfaction.
      "You see," he went on slowly, "I killed him&mdash;it was a quo'll. He was
      my pardner, but I reckon he must have drove me hard. Yes, sir," he added
      with aggrieved reflection, "I reckon he drove me hard."
    
    
      The Colonel smiled courteously, slightly expanding his chest under the
      homicidal relation, as if, having taken it in and made it a part of
      himself, he was ready, if necessary, to become personally responsible for
      it. Then lifting his empty glass to the light, he looked at it with half
      closed eyes, in polite imitation of his companion's examination of the
      paper-weight, and set it down again. A casual spectator from the window
      might have imagined that the two were engaged in an amicable inventory of
      the furniture.
    
    
      "And the&mdash;er&mdash;actual circumstances?" asked the Colonel.
    
    
      "Oh, it was fair enough fight. THEY'LL tell you that. And so would HE, I
      reckon&mdash;if he could. He was ugly and bedev'lin', but I didn't care to
      quo'll, and give him the go-by all the time. He kept on, followed me out
      of the shanty, drew, and fired twice. I"&mdash;he stopped and regarded his
      hat a moment as if it was a corroborating witness&mdash;"I&mdash;I closed
      with him&mdash;I had to&mdash;it was my only chance, and that ended it&mdash;and
      with his own revolver. I never drew mine."
    
    
      "I see," said the Colonel, nodding, "clearly justifiable and honorable as
      regards the code. And you wish me to defend you?"
    
    
      The stranger's gloomy expression of astonishment now turned to blank
      hopelessness.
    
    
      "I knew you didn't understand," he said, despairingly. "Why, all THAT was
      TWO YEARS AGO. It's all settled and done and gone. The jury found for me
      at the inquest. It ain't THAT I want to see you about. It's something
      arising out of it."
    
    
      "Ah," said the Colonel, affably, "a vendetta, perhaps. Some friend or
      relation of his taken up the quarrel?"
    
    
      The stranger looked abstractedly at Starbottle. "You think a relation
      might; or would feel in that sort of way?"
    
    
      "Why, blank it all, sir," said the Colonel, "nothing is more common. Why,
      in '52 one of my oldest friends, Doctor Byrne, of St. Jo, the seventh in a
      line from old General Byrne, of St. Louis, was killed, sir, by Pinkey
      Riggs, seventh in a line from Senator Riggs, of Kentucky. Original cause,
      sir, something about a d&mdash;&mdash;d roasting ear, or a blank persimmon
      in 1832; forty-seven men wiped out in twenty years. Fact, sir."
    
    
      "It ain't that," said the stranger, moving hesitatingly in his chair. "If
      it was anything of that sort I wouldn't mind,&mdash;it might bring matters
      to a wind-up, and I shouldn't have to come here and have this cursed talk
      with you."
    
    
      It was so evident that this frank and unaffected expression of some
      obscure disgust with his own present position had no other implication,
      that the Colonel did not except to it. Yet the man did not go on. He
      stopped and seemed lost in sombre contemplation of his hat.
    
    
      The Colonel leaned back in his chair, fanned himself elegantly, wiped his
      forehead with a large pongee handkerchief, and looking at his companion,
      whose shadowed abstraction seemed to render him impervious to the heat,
      said:&mdash;
    
    
      "My dear Mr. Corbin, I perfectly understand you. Blank it all, sir, the
      temperature in this infernal hole is quite enough to render any
      confidential conversation between gentlemen upon delicate matters utterly
      impossible. It's almost as near Hades, sir, as they make it,&mdash;as I
      trust you and I, Mr. Corbin, will ever experience. I propose," continued
      the Colonel, with airy geniality, "some light change and refreshment. The
      bar-keeper of the Magnolia is&mdash;er&mdash;I may say, sir, facile
      princeps in the concoction of mint juleps, and there is a back room where
      I have occasionally conferred with political leaders at election time. It
      is but a step, sir&mdash;in fact, on Main Street&mdash;round the corner."
    
    
      The stranger looked up and then rose mechanically as the Colonel resumed
      his coat and waistcoat, but not his collar and cravat, which lay limp and
      dejected among his papers. Then, sheltering himself beneath a
      large-brimmed Panama hat, and hooking his cane on his arm, he led the way,
      fan in hand, into the road, tiptoeing in his tight, polished boots through
      the red, impalpable dust with his usual jaunty manner, yet not without a
      profane suggestion of burning ploughshares. The stranger strode in silence
      by his side in the burning sun, impenetrable in his own morose shadow.
    
    
      But the Magnolia was fragrant, like its namesake, with mint and herbal
      odors, cool with sprinkled floors, and sparkling with broken ice on its
      counters, like dewdrops on white, unfolded petals&mdash;and slightly
      soporific with the subdued murmur of droning loungers, who were heavy with
      its sweets. The gallant Colonel nodded with confidential affability to the
      spotless-shirted bar-keeper, and then taking Corbin by the arm fraternally
      conducted him into a small apartment in the rear of the bar-room. It was
      evidently used as the office of the proprietor, and contained a plain
      desk, table, and chairs. At the rear window, Nature, not entirely evicted,
      looked in with a few straggling buckeyes and a dusty myrtle, over the body
      of a lately-felled pine-tree, that flaunted from an upflung branch a still
      green spray as if it were a drooping banner lifted by a dead but rigid
      arm. From the adjoining room the faint, monotonous click of billiard
      balls, languidly played, came at intervals like the dry notes of cicale in
      the bushes.
    
    
      The bar-keeper brought two glasses crowned with mint and diademed with
      broken ice. The Colonel took a long pull at his portion, and leaned back
      in his chair with a bland gulp of satisfaction and dreamily patient eyes.
      The stranger mechanically sipped the contents of his glass, and then,
      without having altered his reluctant expression, drew from his
      breast-pocket a number of old letters. Holding them displayed in his
      fingers like a difficult hand of cards, and with something of the air of a
      dispirited player, he began:&mdash;
    
    
      "You see, about six months after this yer trouble I got this letter." He
      picked out a well worn, badly written missive, and put it into Colonel
      Starbottle's hands, rising at the same time and leaning over him as he
      read. "You see, she that writ it says as how she hadn't heard from her son
      for a long time, but owing to his having spoken once about ME, she was
      emboldened to write and ask me if I knew what had gone of him." He was
      pointing his finger at each line of the letter as he read it, or rather
      seemed to translate it from memory with a sad familiarity. "Now," he
      continued in parenthesis, "you see this kind o' got me. I knew he had got
      relatives in Kentucky. I knew that all this trouble had been put in the
      paper with his name and mine, but this here name of Martha Jeffcourt at
      the bottom didn't seem to jibe with it. Then I remembered that he had left
      a lot of letters in his trunk in the shanty, and I looked 'em over. And I
      found that his name WAS Tom Jeffcourt, and that he'd been passin' under
      the name of Frisbee all this time."
    
    
      "Perfectly natural and a frequent occurrence," interposed the Colonel
      cheerfully. "Only last year I met an old friend whom we'll call Stidger,
      of New Orleans, at the Union Club, 'Frisco. 'How are you, Stidger?' I
      said; 'I haven't seen you since we used to meet&mdash;driving over the
      Shell Road in '53.' 'Excuse me, sir,' said he, 'my name is not Stidger,
      it's Brown.' I looked him in the eye, sir, and saw him quiver. 'Then I
      must apologize to Stidger,' I said, 'for supposing him capable of changing
      his name.' He came to me an hour after, all in a tremble. 'For God's sake,
      Star,' he said,&mdash;always called me Star,&mdash;'don't go back on me,
      but you know family affairs&mdash;another woman, beautiful creature,'
      etc., etc.,&mdash;yes, sir, perfectly common, but a blank mistake. When a
      man once funks his own name he'll turn tail on anything. Sorry for this
      man, Friezecoat, or Turncoat, or whatever's his d&mdash;&mdash;d name; but
      it's so."
    
    
      The suggestion did not, however, seem to raise the stranger's spirits or
      alter his manner. "His name was Jeffcourt, and this here was his mother,"
      he went on drearily; "and you see here she says"&mdash;pointing to the
      letter again&mdash;"she's been expecting money from him and it don't come,
      and she's mighty hard up. And that gave me an idea. I don't know," he went
      on, regarding the Colonel with gloomy doubt, "as you'll think it was much;
      I don't know as you wouldn't call it a d&mdash;&mdash;d fool idea, but I
      got it all the same." He stopped, hesitated, and went on. "You see this
      man, Frisbee or Jeffcourt, was my pardner. We were good friends up to the
      killing, and then he drove me hard. I think I told you he drove me hard,&mdash;didn't
      I? Well, he did. But the idea I got was this. Considerin' I killed him
      after all, and so to speak disappointed them, I reckoned I'd take upon
      myself the care of that family and send 'em money every month."
    
    
      The Colonel slightly straitened his clean-shaven mouth. "A kind of
      expiation or amercement by fine, known to the Mosaic, Roman, and old
      English law. Gad, sir, the Jews might have made you MARRY his widow or
      sister. An old custom, and I think superseded&mdash;sir, properly
      superseded&mdash;by the alternative of ordeal by battle in the mediaeval
      times. I don't myself fancy these pecuniary fashions of settling wrongs,&mdash;but
      go on."
    
    
      "I wrote her," continued Corbin, "that her son was dead, but that he and
      me had some interests together in a claim, and that I was very glad to
      know where to send her what would be his share every month. I thought it
      no use to tell her I killed him,&mdash;may be she might refuse to take it.
      I sent her a hundred dollars every month since. Sometimes it's been pretty
      hard sleddin' to do it, for I ain't rich; sometimes I've had to borrow the
      money, but I reckoned that I was only paying for my share in this here
      business of his bein' dead, and I did it."
    
    
      "And I understand you that this Jeffcourt really had no interest in your
      claim?"
    
    
      Corbin looked at him in dull astonishment. "Not a cent, of course; I
      thought I told you that. But that weren't his fault, for he never had
      anything, and owed me money. In fact," he added gloomily, "it was because
      I hadn't any more to give him&mdash;havin' sold my watch for grub&mdash;that
      he quo'lled with me that day, and up and called me a 'sneakin' Yankee
      hound.' I told you he drove me hard."
    
    
      The Colonel coughed slightly and resumed his jaunty manner. "And the&mdash;er&mdash;mother
      was, of course, grateful and satisfied?"
    
    
      "Well, no,&mdash;not exactly." He stopped again and took up his letters
      once more, sorted and arranged them as if to play out his unfinished but
      hopeless hand, and drawing out another, laid it before the Colonel. "You
      see, this Mrs. Jeffcourt, after a time, reckoned she ought to have MORE
      money than I sent her, and wrote saying that she had always understood
      from her son (he that never wrote but once a year, remember) that this
      claim of ours (that she never knew of, you know) was paying much more than
      I sent her&mdash;and she wanted a return of accounts and papers, or she'd
      write to some lawyer, mighty quick. Well, I reckoned that all this was
      naturally in the line of my trouble, and I DID manage to scrape together
      fifty dollars more for two months and sent it. But that didn't seem to
      satisfy her&mdash;as you see." He dealt Colonel Starbottle another letter
      from his baleful hand with an unchanged face. "When I got that,&mdash;well,
      I just up and told her the whole thing. I sent her the account of the
      fight from the newspapers, and told her as how her son was the Frisbee
      that was my pardner, and how he never had a cent in the world&mdash;but
      how I'd got that idea to help her, and was willing to carry it out as long
      as I could."
    
    
      "Did you keep a copy of that letter?" asked the Colonel, straitening his
      mask-like mouth.
    
    
      "No," said Corbin moodily. "What was the good? I know'd she'd got the
      letter,&mdash;and she did,&mdash;for that is what she wrote back." He laid
      another letter before the Colonel, who hastily read a few lines and then
      brought his fat white hand violently on the desk.
    
    
      "Why, d&mdash;n it all, sir, this is BLACKMAIL! As infamous a case of
      threatening and chantage as I ever heard of."
    
    
      "Well," said Corbin, dejectedly, "I don't know. You see she allows that I
      murdered Frisbee to get hold of his claim, and that I'm trying to buy her
      off, and that if I don't come down with twenty thousand dollars on the
      nail, and notes for the rest, she'll prosecute me. Well, mebbe the thing
      looks to her like that&mdash;mebbe you know I've got to shoulder that too.
      Perhaps it's all in the same line."
    
    
      Colonel Starbottle for a moment regarded Corbin critically. In spite of
      his chivalrous attitude towards the homicidal faculty, the Colonel was not
      optimistic in regard to the baser pecuniary interests of his fellow-man.
      It was quite on the cards that his companion might have murdered his
      partner to get possession of the claim. It was true that Corbin had
      voluntarily assumed an unrecorded and hitherto unknown responsibility that
      had never been even suspected, and was virtually self-imposed. But that
      might have been the usual one unerring blunder of criminal sagacity and
      forethought. It was equally true that he did not look or act like a mean
      murderer; but that was nothing. However, there was no evidence of these
      reflections in the Colonel's face. Rather he suddenly beamed with an
      excess of politeness. "Would you&mdash;er&mdash;mind, Mr. Corbin, whilst I
      am going over those letters again, to&mdash;er&mdash;step across to my
      office&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;bring me the copy of 'Wood's Digest' that
      lies on my table? It will save some time."
    
    
      The stranger rose, as if the service was part of his self-imposed trouble,
      and as equally hopeless with the rest, and taking his hat departed to
      execute the commission. As soon as he had left the building Colonel
      Starbottle opened the door and mysteriously beckoned the bar-keeper
      within.
    
    
      "Do you remember anything of the killing of a man named Frisbee over in
      Fresno three years ago?"
    
    
      The bar-keeper whistled meditatively. "Three years ago&mdash;Frisbee?&mdash;Fresno?&mdash;no?
      Yes&mdash;but that was only one of his names. He was Jack Walker over
      here. Yes&mdash;and by Jove! that feller that was here with you killed
      him. Darn my skin, but I thought I recognized him."
    
    
      "Yes, yes, I know all that," said the Colonel, impatiently. "But did
      Frisbee have any PROPERTY? Did he have any means of his own?"
    
    
      "Property?" echoed the bar-keeper with scornful incredulity. "Property?
      Means? The only property and means he ever had was the free lunches or
      drinks he took in at somebody else's expense. Why, the only chance he ever
      had of earning a square meal was when that fellow that was with you just
      now took him up and made him his partner. And the only way HE could get
      rid of him was to kill him! And I didn't think he had it in him. Rather a
      queer kind o' chap,&mdash;good deal of hayseed about him. Showed up at the
      inquest so glum and orkerd that if the boys hadn't made up their minds
      this yer Frisbee ORTER BEEN killed&mdash;it might have gone hard with
      him."
    
    
      "Mr. Corbin," said Colonel Starbottle, with a pained but unmistakable
      hauteur and a singular elevation of his shirt frill, as if it had become
      of its own accord erectile, "Mr. Corbin&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;is the
      distant relative of old Major Corbin, of Nashville&mdash;er&mdash;one of
      my oldest political friends. When Mr. Corbin&mdash;er&mdash;returns, you
      can conduct him to me. And, if you please, replenish the glasses."
    
    
      When the bar-keeper respectfully showed Mr. Corbin and "Wood's Digest"
      into the room again, the Colonel was still beaming and apologetic.
    
    
      "A thousand thanks, sir, but except to SHOW you the law if you require it&mdash;hardly
      necessary. I have&mdash;er&mdash;glanced over the woman's letters again;
      it would be better, perhaps, if you had kept copies of your own&mdash;but
      still these tell the whole story and YOUR OWN. The claim is preposterous!
      You have simply to drop the whole thing. Stop your remittances, stop your
      correspondence,&mdash;pay no heed to any further letters and wait results.
      You need fear nothing further, sir; I stake my professional reputation on
      it."
    
    
      The gloom of the stranger seemed only to increase as the Colonel reached
      his triumphant conclusion.
    
    
      "I reckoned you'd say that," he said slowly, "but it won't do. I shall go
      on paying as far as I can. It's my trouble and I'll see it through."
    
    
      "But, my dear sir, consider," gasped the Colonel. "You are in the hands of
      an infamous harpy, who is using her son's blood to extract money from you.
      You have already paid a dozen times more than the life of that d&mdash;&mdash;d
      sneak was worth; and more than that&mdash;the longer you keep on paying
      you are helping to give color to their claim and estopping your own
      defense. And Gad, sir, you're making a precedent for this sort of thing!
      you are offering a premium to widows and orphans. A gentleman won't be
      able to exchange shots with another without making himself liable for
      damages. I am willing to admit that your feelings&mdash;though, in my
      opinion&mdash;er&mdash;exaggerated&mdash;do you credit; but I am satisfied
      that they are utterly misunderstood&mdash;sir."
    
    
      "Not by all of them," said Corbin darkly.
    
    
      "Eh?" returned the Colonel quickly.
    
    
      "There was another letter here which I didn't particularly point out to
      you," said Corbin, taking up the letters again, "for I reckoned it wasn't
      evidence, so to speak, being from HIS COUSIN, a girl,&mdash;and calculated
      you'd read it when I was out."
    
    
      The Colonel coughed hastily. "I was in fact&mdash;er&mdash;just about to
      glance over it when you came in."
    
    
      "It was written," continued Corbin, selecting a letter more bethumbed than
      the others, "after the old woman had threatened me. This here young woman
      allows that she is sorry that her aunt has to take money of me on account
      of her cousin being killed, and she is still sorrier that she is so bitter
      against me. She says she hadn't seen her cousin since he was a boy, and
      used to play with her, and that she finds it hard to believe that he
      should ever grow up to change his name and act so as to provoke anybody to
      lift a hand against him. She says she supposed it must be something in
      that dreadful California that alters people and makes everybody so
      reckless. I reckon her head's level there, ain't it?"
    
    
      There was such a sudden and unexpected lightening of the man's face as he
      said it, such a momentary relief to his persistent gloom, that the
      Colonel, albeit inwardly dissenting from both letter and comment, smiled
      condescendingly.
    
    
      "She's no slouch of a scribe neither," continued Corbin animatedly. "Read
      that."
    
    
      He handed his companion the letter, pointing to a passage with his finger.
      The Colonel took it with, I fear, a somewhat lowered opinion of his
      client, and a new theory of the case. It was evident that this weak
      submission to the aunt's conspiracy was only the result of a greater
      weakness for the niece. Colonel Starbottle had a wholesome distrust of the
      sex as a business or political factor. He began to look over the letter,
      but was evidently slurring it with superficial politeness, when Corbin
      said:&mdash;
    
    
      "Read it out loud."
    
    
      The Colonel slightly lifted his shoulders, fortified himself with another
      sip of the julep, and, leaning back, oratorically began to read,&mdash;the
      stranger leaning over him and following line by line with shining eyes.
    
    
      "'When I say I am sorry for you, it is because I think it must be dreadful
      for you to be going round with the blood of a fellow-creature on your
      hands. It must be awful for you in the stillness of the night season to
      hear the voice of the Lord saying, "Cain, where is thy brother?" and you
      saying, "Lord, I have slayed him dead." It must be awful for you when the
      pride of your wrath was surfitted, and his dum senseless corps was before
      you, not to know that it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay,"
      saith the Lord. . . . It was no use for you to say, "I never heard that
      before," remembering your teacher and parents. Yet verily I say unto you,
      "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be washed whiter than snow,"
      saith the Lord&mdash;Isaiah i. 18; and "Heart hath no sorrow that Heaven
      cannot heal."&mdash;My hymn book, 1st Presbyterian Church, page 79. Mr.
      Corbin, I pity your feelins at the grave of my pore dear cousin, knowing
      he is before his Maker, and you can't bring him back.' Umph!&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;very
      good&mdash;very good indeed," said the Colonel, hastily refolding the
      letter. "Very well meaning and&mdash;er"&mdash;
    
    
      "Go on," said Corbin over his shoulder, "you haven't read all."
    
    
      "Ah, true. I perceive I overlooked something. Um&mdash;um. 'May God
      forgive you, Mr. Corbin, as I do, and make aunty think better of you, for
      it was good what you tried to do for her and the fammely, and I've always
      said it when she was raging round and wanting money of you. I don't
      believe you meant to do it anyway, owin' to your kindness of heart to the
      ophanless and the widow since you did it. Anser this letter, and don't
      mind what aunty says. So no more at present from&mdash;Yours very
      respectfully, SALLY DOWS.
    
    
      "'P. S.&mdash;There's been some troubel in our township, and some fitin'.
      May the Lord change ther hearts and make them as a little child, for if
      you are still young you may grow up different. I have writ a short prayer
      for you to say every night. You can coppy it out and put it at the head of
      your bed. It is this: O Lord make me sorry for having killed Sarah Dows'
      cousin. Give me, O Lord, that peace that the world cannot give, and which
      fadeth not away; for my yoke is heavy, and my burden is harder than I can
      bear.'"
    
    
      The Colonel's deliberate voice stopped. There was a silence in the room,
      and the air seemed stifling. The click of the billiard balls came
      distinctly through the partition from the other room. Then there was
      another click, a stamp on the floor, and a voice crying coarsely: "Curse
      it all&mdash;missed again!"
    
    
      To the stranger's astonishment, the Colonel was on his feet in an instant,
      gasping with inarticulate rage. Flinging the door open, he confronted the
      startled bar-keeper empurpled and stertorous.
    
    
      "Blank it all, sir, do you call this a saloon for gentlemen, or a corral
      for swearing cattle? Or do you mean to say that the conversation of two
      gentlemen upon delicate professional&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;domestic
      affairs&mdash;is to be broken upon by the blank profanity of low-bred
      hounds over their picayune gambling! Take them my kyard, sir," choked the
      Colonel, who was always Southern and dialectic in his excited as in his
      softest moments, "and tell them that Colonel Starbottle will nevah dyarken
      these doahs again."
    
    
      Before the astonished bar-keeper could reply, the Colonel had dashed back
      into the room, clapped his hat on his head, and seized his book, letters,
      and cane. "Mr. Corbin," he said with gasping dignity, "I will take these
      papahs, and consult them again in my own office&mdash;where, if you will
      do me the honor, sir, to call at ten o'clock to-morrow, I will give you my
      opinion." He strode out of the saloon beside the half awe-stricken,
      half-amused, yet all discreetly silent loungers, followed by his wondering
      but gloomy client. At the door they parted,&mdash;the Colonel tiptoeing
      towards his office as if dancing with rage, the stranger darkly plodding
      through the stifling dust in the opposite direction, with what might have
      been a faint suggestion to his counselor, that the paths of the homicide
      did not lie beside the still cool waters.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II.
    
    
      The house of Captain Masterton Dows, at Pineville, Kentucky, was a fine
      specimen of Southern classical architecture, being an exact copy of Major
      Fauquier's house in Virginia, which was in turn only a slight variation
      from a well-known statesman's historical villa in Alabama, that everybody
      knew was designed from a famous Greek temple on the Piraeus. Not but that
      it shared this resemblance with the County Court House and the Odd
      Fellows' Hall, but the addition of training jessamine and Cherokee rose to
      the columns of the portico, and over the colonnade leading to its offices,
      showed a certain domestic distinction. And the sky line of its
      incongruously high roof was pleasantly broken against adjacent green
      pines, butternut, and darker cypress.
    
    
      A nearer approach showed the stuccoed gateposts&mdash;whose red brick core
      was revealed through the dropping plaster&mdash;opening in a wall of
      half-rough stone, half-wooden palisade, equally covered with shining moss
      and parasitical vines, which hid a tangled garden left to its own unkempt
      luxuriance. Yet there was a reminiscence of past formality and even
      pretentiousness in a wide box-bordered terrace and one or two stuccoed
      vases prematurely worn and time-stained; while several rare exotics had,
      however, thriven so unwisely and well in that stimulating soil as to lose
      their exclusive refinement and acquire a certain temporary vulgarity. A
      few, with the not uncommon enthusiasm of aliens, had adopted certain
      native peculiarities with a zeal that far exceeded any indigenous
      performance. But dominant through all was the continual suggestion of
      precocious fruition and premature decay that lingered like a sad perfume
      in the garden, but made itself persistent if less poetical in the house.
    
    
      Here the fluted wooden columns of the portico and colonnade seemed to have
      taken upon themselves a sodden and unwholesome age unknown to stone and
      mortar. Moss and creeper clung to paint that time had neither dried nor
      mellowed, but left still glairy in its white consistency. There were rusty
      red blotches around inflamed nail-holes in the swollen wood, as of
      punctures in living flesh; along the entablature and cornices and in the
      dank gutters decay had taken the form of a mild deliquescence; and the
      pillars were spotted as if Nature had dropped over the too early ruin a
      few unclean tears. The house itself was lifted upon a broad wooden
      foundation painted to imitate marble with such hopeless mendacity that the
      architect at the last moment had added a green border, and the owner
      permitted a fallen board to remain off so as to allow a few privileged
      fowls to openly explore the interior. When Miss Sally Dows played the
      piano in the drawing-room she was at times accompanied by the uplifted
      voice of the sympathetic hounds who sought its quiet retreat in ill-health
      or low spirits, and from whom she was separated only by an imperfectly
      carpeted floor of yawning seams. The infant progeny of "Mammy Judy," an
      old nurse, made this a hiding-place from domestic justice, where they were
      eventually betrayed by subterranean giggling that had once or twice
      brought bashful confusion to the hearts of Miss Sally's admirers, and
      mischievous security to that finished coquette herself.
    
    
      It was a pleasant September afternoon, on possibly one of these occasions,
      that Miss Sally, sitting before the piano, alternately striking a few
      notes with three pink fingers and glancing at her reflection in the
      polished rosewood surface of the lifted keyboard case, was heard to utter
      this languid protest:&mdash;
    
    
      "Quit that kind of talk, Chet, unless you just admire to have every word
      of it repeated all over the county. Those little niggers of Mammy Judy's
      are lying round somewhere and are mighty 'cute, and sassy, I tell you.
      It's nothin' to ME, sure, but Miss Hilda mightn't like to hear of it. So
      soon after your particular attention to her at last night's pawty too."
    
    
      Here a fresh-looking young fellow of six-and-twenty, leaning uneasily over
      the piano from the opposite side, was heard to murmur that he didn't care
      what Miss Hilda heard, nor the whole world, for the matter of that. "But,"
      he added, with a faint smile, "folks allow that you know how to PLAY UP
      sometimes, and put on the loud pedal, when you don't want Mammy's niggers
      to hear."
    
    
      "Indeed," said the young lady demurely. "Like this?"
    
    
      She put out a distracting little foot, clothed in the white stocking and
      cool black prunella slipper then de rigueur in the State, and, pressing it
      on the pedal, began to drum vigorously on the keys. In vain the amorous
      Chet protested in a voice which the instrument drowned. Perceiving which
      the artful young lady opened her blue eyes mildly and said:&mdash;
    
    
      "I reckon it IS so; it DOES kind of prevent you hearing what you don't
      want to hear."
    
    
      "You know well enough what I mean," said the youth gloomily. "And that
      ain't all that folks say. They allow that you're doin' a heap too much
      correspondence with that Californian rough that killed Tom Jeffcourt over
      there."
    
    
      "Do they?" said the young lady, with a slight curl of her pretty lip.
      "Then perhaps they allow that if it wasn't for me he wouldn't be sending a
      hundred dollars a month to Aunt Martha?"
    
    
      "Yes," said the fatuous youth; "but they allow he killed Tom for his
      money. And they do say it's mighty queer doin's in yo' writin' religious
      letters to him, and Tom your own cousin."
    
    
      "Oh, they tell those lies HERE, do they? But do they say anything about
      how, when the same lies were told over in California, the lawyer they've
      got over there, called Colonel Starbottle,&mdash;a Southern man too,&mdash;got
      up and just wrote to Aunt Martha that she'd better quit that afore she got
      prosecuted? They didn't tell you that, did they, Mister Chester Brooks?"
    
    
      But here the unfortunate Brooks, after the fashion of all jealous lovers,
      deserted his allies for his fair enemy. "I don't cotton to what THEY say,
      Sally, but you DO write to him, and I don't see what you've got to write
      about&mdash;you and him. Jule Jeffcourt says that when you got religion at
      Louisville during the revival, you felt you had a call to write and save
      sinners, and you did that as your trial and probation, but that since you
      backslided and are worldly again, and go to parties, you just keep it up
      for foolin' and flirtin'! SHE ain't goin' to weaken on the man that shot
      her brother, just because he's got a gold mine and&mdash;a mustache!"
    
    
      "She takes his MONEY all the same," said Miss Sally.
    
    
      "SHE don't,&mdash;her mother does. SHE says if she was a man she'd have
      blood for blood!"
    
    
      "My!" said Miss Sally, in affected consternation. "It's a wonder she don't
      apply to you to act for her."
    
    
      "If it was MY brother he killed, I'd challenge him quick enough," said
      Chet, flushing through his thin pink skin and light hair.
    
    
      "Marry her, then, and that'll make you one of the family. I reckon Miss
      Hilda can bear it," rejoined the young lady pertly.
    
    
      "Look here, Miss Sally," said the young fellow with a boyish despair that
      was not without a certain pathos in its implied inferiority, "I ain't
      gifted like you&mdash;I ain't on yo' level no how; I can't pass yo' on the
      road, and so I reckon I must take yo' dust as yo' make it. But there is
      one thing, Miss Sally, I want to tell you. You know what's going on in
      this country, you've heard your father say what the opinion of the best
      men is, and what's likely to happen if the Yanks force that nigger
      worshiper, Lincoln, on the South. You know that we're drawing the line
      closer every day, and spottin' the men that ain't sound. Take care, Miss
      Sally, you ain't sellin' us cheap to some Northern Abolitionist who'd like
      to set Marm Judy's little niggers to something worse than eavesdropping
      down there, and mebbe teach 'em to kindle a fire underneath yo' own flo'."
    
    
      He had become quite dialectic in his appeal, as if youthfully reverting to
      some accent of the nursery, or as if he were exhorting her in some
      recognized shibboleth of a section. Miss Sally rose and shut down the
      piano. Then leaning over it on her elbows, her rounded little chin
      slightly elevated with languid impertinence, and one saucy foot kicked
      backwards beyond the hem of her white cotton frock, she said: "And let me
      tell you, Mister Chester Brooks, that it's just such God-forsaken, infant
      phenomenons as you who want to run the whole country that make all this
      fuss, when you ain't no more fit to be trusted with matches than Judy's
      children. What do YOU know of Mr. Jo Corbin, when you don't even know that
      he's from Shelbyville, and as good a Suth'ner as you, and if he hasn't got
      niggers it's because they don't use them in his parts? Yo'r for all the
      world like one o' Mrs. Johnson's fancy bantams that ain't quit of the
      shell afore they square off at their own mother. My goodness! Sho!
      Sho-o-o!" And suiting the action to the word the young lady, still
      indolently, even in her simulation, swirled around, caught her skirts at
      the side with each hand, and lazily shaking them before her in the
      accepted feminine method of frightening chickens as she retreated
      backwards, dropped them suddenly in a profound curtsey and swept out of
      the parlor.
    
    
      Nevertheless, as she entered the sitting-room she paused to listen, then,
      going to the window, peeped through the slits of the Venetian blind and
      saw her youthful admirer, more dejected in the consciousness of his wasted
      efforts and useless attire, mount his showy young horse, as aimlessly
      spirited as himself, and ride away. Miss Sally did not regret this;
      neither had she been entirely sincere in her defense of her mysterious
      correspondent. But, like many of her sex, she was trying to keep up by the
      active stimulus of opposition an interest that she had begun to think if
      left to itself might wane. She was conscious that her cousin Julia,
      although impertinent and illogical, was right in considering her first
      epistolary advances to Corbin as a youthful convert's religious zeal. But
      now that her girlish enthusiasm was spent, and the revival itself had
      proved as fleeting an excitement as the old "Tournament of Love and
      Beauty," which it had supplanted, she preferred to believe that she
      enjoyed the fascinating impropriety because it was the actual result of
      her religious freedom. Perhaps she had a vague idea that Corbin's
      conversion would expiate her present preference for dress and dancing. She
      had certainly never flirted with him; they had never exchanged
      photographs; there was not a passage in his letters that might not have
      been perused by her parents,&mdash;which, I fear, was probably one reason
      why she had never shown her correspondence; and beyond the fact that this
      letter-writing gave her a certain importance in her own eyes and those of
      her companions, it might really be stopped. She even thought of writing at
      once to him that her parents objected to its further continuance, but
      remembering that his usual monthly letter was now nearly due, she
      concluded to wait until it came.
    
    
      It is to be feared that Miss Sally had little help in the way of family
      advice, and that the moral administration of the Dows household was as
      prematurely developed and as precociously exhausted as the estate and
      mansion themselves. Captain Dows' marriage with Josephine Jeffcourt, the
      daughter of a "poor white," had been considered a mesalliance by his
      family, and his own sister, Miranda Dows, had abandoned her brother's roof
      and refused to associate with the Jeffcourts, only returning to the house
      and an armed neutrality at the death of Mrs. Dows a few years later. She
      had taken charge of Miss Sally, sending her to school at Nashville until
      she was recalled by her father two years ago. It may be imagined that Miss
      Sally's correspondence with Jeffcourt's murderer had afforded her a mixed
      satisfaction; it was at first asserted that Miss Sally's forgiveness was
      really prompted by "Miss Mirandy," as a subtle sarcasm upon the family.
      When, however, that forgiveness seemed to become a source of revenue to
      the impoverished Jeffcourts, her Christian interference had declined.
    
    
      For this reason, possibly, the young girl did not seek her aunt in the
      bedroom, the dining-room, or the business-room, where Miss Miranda
      frequently assisted Captain Dows in the fatuous and prejudiced
      mismanagement of the house and property, nor in any of the vacant
      guest-rooms, which, in their early wreck of latter-day mahogany and
      rosewood, seemed to have been unoccupied for ages, but went directly to
      her own room. This was in the "L," a lately added wing that had escaped
      the gloomy architectural tyranny of the main building, and gave Miss Sally
      light, ventilation, the freshness and spice of new pine boards and clean
      paper, and a separate entrance and windows on a cool veranda all to
      herself. Intended as a concession to the young lady's traveled taste, it
      was really a reversion to the finer simplicity of the pioneer.
    
    
      New as the apartment appeared to be, it was old enough to contain the
      brief little records of her maidenhood: the childish samplers and
      pictures; the sporting epoch with its fox-heads, opossum and wild-cat
      skins, riding-whip, and the goshawk in a cage, which Miss Sally believed
      could be trained as a falcon; the religious interval of illustrated texts,
      "Rock of Ages," cardboard crosses, and the certificate of her membership
      with "The Daughters of Sion" at the head of her little bed, down to the
      last decadence of frivolity shown in the be-ribboned guitar in the corner,
      and the dance cards, favors, and rosettes, military buttons, dried
      bouquets, and other love gages on the mantelpiece.
    
    
      The young girl opened a drawer of her table and took out a small packet of
      letters tied up with a green ribbon. As she did so she heard the sound of
      hoofs in the rear courtyard. This was presently followed by a step on the
      veranda, and she opened the door to her father with the letters still in
      her hand. There was neither the least embarrassment nor self-consciousness
      in her manner.
    
    
      Captain Dows, superficially remarkable only for a certain odd combination
      of high military stock and turned-over planter's collar, was slightly
      exalted by a sympathetic mingling of politics and mint julep at Pineville
      Court House. "I was passing by the post-office at the Cross Roads last
      week, dear," he began, cheerfully, "and I thought of you, and reckoned it
      was about time that my Pussy got one of her letters from her rich
      Californian friend&mdash;and sure enough there was one. I clean forgot to
      give it to you then, and only remembered it passing there to-day. I didn't
      get to see if there was any gold-dust in it," he continued, with great
      archness, and a fatherly pinch of her cheek; "though I suspect that isn't
      the kind of currency he sends to you."
    
    
      "It IS from Mr. Corbin," said Miss Sally, taking it with a languid kind of
      doubt; "and only now, paw, I was just thinking that I'd sort of drop
      writing any more; it makes a good deal of buzzing amongst the neighbors,
      and I don't see much honey nor comb in it."
    
    
      "Eh," said the Captain, apparently more astonished than delighted at his
      daughter's prudence. "Well, child, suit yourself! It's mighty mean,
      though, for I was just thinking of telling you that Judge Read is an old
      friend of this Colonel Starbottle, who is your friend's friend and lawyer,
      and he says that Colonel Starbottle is WITH US, and working for the cause
      out there, and has got a list of all the So'thern men in California that
      are sound and solid for the South. Read says he shouldn't wonder if he'd
      make California wheel into line too."
    
    
      "I don't see what that's got to do with Mr. Corbin," said the young girl,
      impatiently, flicking the still unopened letter against the packet in her
      hand.
    
    
      "Well," said the Captain, with cheerful vagueness, "I thought it might
      interest you,&mdash;that's all," and lounged judicially away.
    
    
      "Paw thinks," said Miss Sally, still standing in the doorway,
      ostentatiously addressing her pet goshawk, but with one eye following her
      retreating parent, "Paw thinks that everybody is as keen bent on politics
      as he is. There's where paw slips up, Jim."
    
    
      Re-entering the room, scratching her little nose thoughtfully with the
      edge of Mr. Corbin's letter, she went to the mantelpiece and picked up a
      small ivory-handled dagger, the gift of Joyce Masterton, aged eighteen,
      presented with certain verses addressed to a "Daughter of the South," and
      cut open the envelope. The first glance was at her own name, and then at
      the signature. There was no change in the formality; it was "Dear Miss
      Sarah," and "Yours respectfully, Jo Corbin," as usual. She was still
      secure. But her pretty brows contracted slightly as she read as follows:&mdash;
    
    
      "I've always allowed I should feel easier in my mind if I could ever get
      to see Mrs. Jeffcourt, and that may be she might feel easier in hers if I
      stood before her, face to face. Even if she didn't forgive me at once, it
      might do her good to get off what she had on her mind against me. But as
      there wasn't any chance of her coming to me, and it was out of the
      question my coming to her and still keeping up enough work in the mines to
      send her the regular money, it couldn't be done. But at last I've got a
      partner to run the machine when I'm away. I shall be at Shelbyville by the
      time this reaches you, where I shall stay a day or two to give you time to
      break the news to Mrs. Jeffcourt, and then come on. You will do this for
      me in your Christian kindness, Miss Dows&mdash;won't you? and if you could
      soften her mind so as to make it less hard for me I shall be grateful.
    
    
      "P. S.&mdash;I forgot to say I have had HIM exhumed&mdash;you know who I
      mean&mdash;and am bringing him with me in a patent metallic burial casket,&mdash;the
      best that could be got in 'Frisco, and will see that he is properly buried
      in your own graveyard. It seemed to me that it would be the best thing I
      could do, and might work upon her feelings&mdash;as it has on mine. Don't
      you?
    
    
      "J. C."
    
    
      Miss Sally felt the tendrils of her fair hair stir with consternation. The
      letter had arrived a week ago; perhaps he was in Pineville at that very
      moment! She must go at once to the Jeffcourts,&mdash;it was only a mile
      distant. Perhaps she might be still in time; but even then it was a
      terribly short notice for such a meeting. Yet she stopped to select her
      newest hat from the closet, and to tie it with the largest of bows under
      her pretty chin; and then skipped from the veranda into a green lane that
      ran beside the garden boundary. There, hidden by a hedge, she dropped into
      a long, swinging trot, that even in her haste still kept the languid
      deliberation characteristic of her people, until she had reached the road.
      Two or three hounds in the garden started joyously to follow her, but she
      drove them back with a portentous frown, and an ill-aimed stone, and a
      suppressed voice. Yet in that backward glance she could see that her
      little Eumenides&mdash;Mammy Judy's children&mdash;were peering at her
      from below the wooden floor of the portico, which they were grasping with
      outstretched arms and bowed shoulders, as if they were black caryatides
      supporting&mdash;as indeed their race had done for many a year&mdash;the
      pre-doomed and decaying mansion of their master.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER III.
    
    
      Happily Miss Sally thought more of her present mission than of the past
      errors of her people. The faster she walked the more vividly she pictured
      the possible complications of this meeting. She knew the dull, mean nature
      of her aunt, and the utter hopelessness of all appeal to anything but her
      selfish cupidity, and saw in this fatuous essay of Corbin only an
      aggravation of her worst instincts. Even the dead body of her son would
      not only whet her appetite for pecuniary vengeance, but give it
      plausibility in the eyes of their emotional but ignorant neighbors. She
      had still less to hope from Julia Jeffcourt's more honest and human
      indignation but equally bigoted and prejudiced intelligence. It is true
      they were only women, and she ought to have no fear of that physical
      revenge which Julia had spoken of, but she reflected that Miss Jeffcourt's
      unmistakable beauty, and what was believed to be a "truly Southern
      spirit," had gained her many admirers who might easily take her wrongs
      upon their shoulders. If her father had only given her that letter before,
      she might have stopped Corbin's coming at all; she might even have met him
      in time to hurry him and her cousin's provocative remains out of the
      country. In the midst of these reflections she had to pass the little
      hillside cemetery. It was a spot of great natural beauty, cypress-shadowed
      and luxuriant. It was justly celebrated in Pineville, and, but for its
      pretentious tombstones, might have been peaceful and suggestive. Here she
      recognized a figure just turning from its gate. It was Julia Jeffcourt.
    
    
      Her first instinct&mdash;that she was too late and that her cousin had
      come to the cemetery to make some arrangements for the impending burial&mdash;was,
      however, quickly dissipated by the young girl's manner.
    
    
      "Well, Sally Dows, YOU here! who'd have thought of seeing you to-day? Why,
      Chet Brooks allowed that you danced every set last night and didn't get
      home till daylight. And you&mdash;you that are going to show up at another
      party to-night too! Well, I reckon I haven't got that much ambition these
      times. And out with your new bonnet too."
    
    
      There was a slight curl of her handsome lip as she looked at her cousin.
      She was certainly a more beautiful girl than Miss Sally; very tall, dark
      and luminous of eye, with a brunette pallor of complexion, suggesting, it
      was said, that remote mixture of blood which was one of the unproven
      counts of Miss Miranda's indictment against her family. Miss Sally smiled
      sweetly behind her big bow. "If you reckon to tie to everything that Chet
      Brooks says, you'll want lots of string, and you won't be safe then. You
      ought to have heard him run on about this one, and that one, and that
      other one, not an hour ago in our parlor. I had to pack him off, saying he
      was even making Judy's niggers tired." She stopped and added with polite
      languor, "I suppose there's no news up at yo' house either? Everything's
      going on as usual&mdash;and&mdash;you get yo' California draft regularly?"
    
    
      A good deal of the white of Julia's beautiful eyes showed as she turned
      indignantly on the speaker. "I wish, cousin Sally, you'd just let up
      talking to me about that money. You know as well as I do that I allowed to
      maw I wouldn't take a cent of it from the first! I might have had all the
      gowns and bonnets"&mdash;with a look at Miss Sally's bows&mdash;"I wanted
      from her; she even offered to take me to St. Louis for a rig-out&mdash;if
      I'd been willing to take blood money. But I'd rather stick to this old
      sleazy mou'nin' for Tom"&mdash;she gave a dramatic pluck at her faded
      black skirt&mdash;"than flaunt round in white muslins and China silks at
      ten dollars a yard, paid for by his murderer."
    
    
      "You know black's yo' color always,&mdash;taking in your height and
      complexion, Jule," said Miss Sally demurely, yet not without a feminine
      consciousness that it really did set off her cousin's graceful figure to
      perfection. "But you can't keep up this gait always. You know some day you
      might come upon this Mr. Corbin."
    
    
      "He'd better not cross my path," she said passionately.
    
    
      "I've heard girls talk like that about a man and then get just green and
      yellow after him," said Miss Sally critically. "But goodness me! speaking
      of meeting people reminds me I clean forgot to stop at the stage office
      and see about bringing over the new overseer. Lucky I met you, Jule!
      Good-by, dear. Come in to-night, and we'll all go to the party together."
      And with a little nod she ran off before her indignant cousin could frame
      a suitably crushing reply to her Parthian insinuation.
    
    
      But at the stage office Miss Sally only wrote a few lines on a card, put
      it in an envelope, which she addressed to Mr. Joseph Corbin, and then
      seating herself with easy carelessness on a long packing-box, languidly
      summoned the proprietor.
    
    
      "You're always on hand yourself at Kirby station when the kyars come in to
      bring passengers to Pineville, Mr. Sledge?"
    
    
      "Yes, Miss."
    
    
      "Yo' haven't brought any strangers over lately?"
    
    
      "Well, last week Squire Farnham of Green Ridge&mdash;if he kin be called a
      stranger&mdash;as used to live in the very house yo father"&mdash;
    
    
      "Yes, I know," said Miss Sally, impatiently, "but if an ENTIRE stranger
      comes to take a seat for Pineville, you ask him if that's his name,"
      handing the letter, "and give it to him if it is. And&mdash;Mr. Sledge&mdash;it's
      nobody's business but&mdash;yours and mine."
    
    
      "I understand, Miss Sally," with a slow, paternal, tolerating wink. "He'll
      get it, and nobody else, sure."
    
    
      "Thank you; I hope Mrs. Sledge is getting round again."
    
    
      "Pow'fully, Miss Sally."
    
    
      Having thus, as she hoped, stopped the arrival of the unhappy Corbin, Miss
      Sally returned home to consider the best means of finally disposing of
      him. She had insisted upon his stopping at Kirby and holding no
      communication with the Jeffcourts until he heard from her, and had
      strongly pointed out the hopeless infelicity of his plan. She dare not
      tell her Aunt Miranda, knowing that she would be too happy to precipitate
      an interview that would terminate disastrously to both the Jeffcourts and
      Corbin. She might have to take her father into her confidence,&mdash;a
      dreadful contingency.
    
    
      She was dressed for the evening party, which was provincially early;
      indeed, it was scarcely past nine o'clock when she had finished her
      toilet, when there came a rap at her door. It was one of Mammy Judy's
      children.
    
    
      "Dey is a gemplum, Miss Sally."
    
    
      "Yes, yes," said Miss Sally, impatiently, thinking only of her escort.
      "I'll be there in a minute. Run away. He can wait."
    
    
      "And he said I was to guv yo' dis yer," continued the little negro with
      portentous gravity, presenting a card.
    
    
      Miss Sally took it with a smile. It was a plain card on which was written
      with a pencil in a hand she hurriedly recognized, "Joseph Corbin."
    
    
      Miss Sally's smile became hysterically rigid, and pushing the boy aside
      with a little cry, she darted along the veranda and entered the parlor
      from a side door and vestibule. To her momentary relief she saw that her
      friends had not yet arrived: a single figure&mdash;a stranger's&mdash;rose
      as she entered.
    
    
      Even in her consternation she had time to feel the added shock of
      disappointment. She had always present in her mind an ideal picture of
      this man whom she had never seen or even heard described. Joseph Corbin
      had been tall, dark, with flowing hair and long mustache. He had flashing
      fiery eyes which were capable of being subdued by a single glance of
      gentleness&mdash;her own. He was tempestuous, quick, and passionate, but
      in quarrel would be led by a smile. He was a combination of an Italian
      brigand and a poker player whom she had once met on a Mississippi
      steamboat. He would wear a broad-brimmed soft hat, a red shirt, showing
      his massive throat and neck&mdash;and high boots! Alas! the man before her
      was of medium height, with light close-cut hair, hollow cheeks that seemed
      to have been lately scraped with a razor, and light gray troubled eyes. A
      suit of cheap black, ill fitting, hastily acquired, and provincial even
      for Pineville, painfully set off these imperfections, to which a white
      cravat in a hopelessly tied bow was superadded. A terrible idea that this
      combination of a country undertaker and an ill-paid circuit preacher on
      probation was his best holiday tribute to her, and not a funeral offering
      to Mr. Jeffcourt, took possession of her. And when, with feminine
      quickness, she saw his eyes wander over her own fine clothes and festal
      figure, and sink again upon the floor in a kind of hopeless disappointment
      equal to her own, she felt ready to cry. But the more terrible sound of
      laughter approaching the house from the garden recalled her. Her friends
      were coming.
    
    
      "For Heaven's sake," she broke out desperately, "didn't you get my note at
      the station telling you not to come?"
    
    
      His face grew darker, and then took up its look of hopeless resignation,
      as if this last misfortune was only an accepted part of his greater
      trouble, as he sat down again, and to Miss Sally's horror, listlessly
      swung his hat to and fro under his chair.
    
    
      "No," he said, gloomily, "I didn't go to no station. I walked here all the
      way from Shelbyville. I thought it might seem more like the square thing
      to her for me to do. I sent HIM by express ahead in the box. It's been at
      the stage office all day."
    
    
      With a sickening conviction that she had been sitting on her cousin's body
      while she wrote that ill-fated card, the young girl managed to gasp out
      impatiently: "But you must go&mdash;yes&mdash;go now, at once! Don't talk
      now, but go."
    
    
      "I didn't come here," he said, rising with a kind of slow dignity, "to
      interfere with things I didn't kalkilate to see," glancing again at her
      dress, as the voices came nearer, "and that I ain't in touch with,&mdash;but
      to know if you think I'd better bring him&mdash;or"&mdash;
    
    
      He did not finish the sentence, for the door had opened suddenly, and a
      half-dozen laughing girls and their escorts burst into the room. But among
      them, a little haughty and still irritated from her last interview, was
      her cousin Julia Jeffcourt, erect and beautiful in a sombre silk.
    
    
      "Go," repeated Miss Sally, in an agonized whisper. "You must not be known
      here."
    
    
      But the attention of Julia had been arrested by her cousin's agitation,
      and her eye fell on Corbin, where it was fixed with some fatal fascination
      that seemed in turn to enthrall and possess him also. To Miss Sally's
      infinite dismay the others fell back and allowed these two black figures
      to stand out, then to move towards each other with the same terrible
      magnetism. They were so near she could not repeat her warning to him
      without the others hearing it. And all hope died when Corbin, turning
      deliberately towards her with a grave gesture in the direction of Julia,
      said quietly:&mdash;
    
    
      "Interduce me."
    
    
      Miss Sally hesitated, and then gasped hastily, "Miss Jeffcourt."
    
    
      "Yer don't say MY name. Tell her I'm Joseph Corbin of 'Frisco, California,
      who killed her brother." He stopped and turned towards her. "I came here
      to try and fix things again&mdash;and I've brought HIM."
    
    
      In the wondering silence that ensued the others smiled vacantly,
      breathlessly, and expectantly, until Corbin advanced and held out his
      hand, when Julia Jeffcourt, drawing hers back to her bosom with the palms
      outward, uttered an inarticulate cry and&mdash;and spat in his face!
    
    
      With that act she found tongue&mdash;reviling him, the house that harbored
      him, the insolence that presented him, the insult that had been put upon
      her! "Are you men!" she added passionately, "who stand here with the man
      before you that killed my brother, and see him offer me his filthy
      villainous hand&mdash;and dare not strike him down!"
    
    
      And they dared not. Violently, blindly, stupidly moved though all their
      instincts, though they gathered hysterically around him, there was
      something in his dull self-containment that was unassailable and awful.
      For he wiped his face and breast with his handkerchief without a tremor,
      and turned to them with even a suggestion of relief.
    
    
      "She's right, gentlemen," he said gravely. "She's right. It might have
      been otherwise. I might have allowed that it might be otherwise,&mdash;but
      she's right. I'm a Soth'n man myself, gentlemen, and I reckon to
      understand what she has done. I killed the only man that had a right to
      stand up for her, and she has now to stand up for herself. But if she
      wants&mdash;and you see she allows she wants&mdash;to pass that on to some
      of you, or all of you, I'm willing. As many as you like, and in what way
      you like&mdash;I waive any chyce of weapon&mdash;I'm ready, gentlemen. I
      came here&mdash;with HIM&mdash;for that purpose."
    
    
      Perhaps it may have been his fateful resignation; perhaps it may have been
      his exceeding readiness,&mdash;but there was no response. He sat down
      again, and again swung his hat slowly and gloomily to and fro under his
      chair.
    
    
      "I've got him in a box at the stage office," he went on, apparently to the
      carpet. "I had him dug up that I might bring him here, and mebbe bury some
      of the trouble and difference along with his friends. It might be," he
      added, with a slightly glowering upward glance, as to an overruling, but
      occasionally misdirecting Providence,&mdash;"it might be from the way
      things are piling up on me that some one might have rung in another corpse
      instead o' HIM, but so far as I can judge, allowin' for the space of time
      and nat'ral wear and tear&mdash;it's HIM!"
    
    
      He rose slowly and moved towards the door in a silence that was as much
      the result of some conviction that any violent demonstration against him
      would be as grotesque and monstrous as the situation, as of anything he
      had said. Even the flashing indignation of Julia Jeffcourt seemed to
      become suddenly as unnatural and incongruous as her brother's chief
      mourner himself, and although she shrank from his passing figure she
      uttered no word. Chester Brooks's youthful emotions, following the
      expression of Miss Sally's face, lost themselves in a vague hysteric
      smile, and the other gentlemen looked sheepish. Joseph Corbin halted at
      the door.
    
    
      "Whatever," he said, turning to the company, "ye make up your mind to do
      about me, I reckon ye'd better do it AFTER the funeral. I'M always ready.
      But HE, what with being in a box and changing climate, had better go
      FIRST." He paused, and with a suggestion of delicacy in the momentary
      dropping of his eyelids, added,&mdash;"for REASONS."
    
    
      He passed out through the door, on to the portico and thence into the
      garden. It was noticed at the time that the half-dozen hounds lingering
      there rushed after him with their usual noisy demonstrations, but that
      they as suddenly stopped, retreated violently to the security of the
      basement, and there gave relief to their feelings in a succession of
      prolonged howls.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IV.
    
    
      It must not be supposed that Miss Sally did not feel some contrition over
      the ineffective part she had played in this last episode. But Joseph
      Corbin had committed the unpardonable sin to a woman of destroying her own
      illogical ideas of him, which was worse than if he had affronted the
      preconceived ideas of others, in which case she might still defend him.
      Then, too, she was no longer religious, and had no "call" to act as
      peacemaker. Nevertheless she resented Julia Jeffcourt's insinuations
      bitterly, and the cousins quarreled&mdash;not the first time in their
      intercourse&mdash;and it was reserved for the latter to break the news of
      Corbin's arrival with the body to Mrs. Jeffcourt.
    
    
      How this was done and what occurred at that interview has not been
      recorded. But it was known the next day that, while Mrs. Jeffcourt
      accepted the body at Corbin's hands,&mdash;and it is presumed the funeral
      expenses also,&mdash;he was positively forbidden to appear either at the
      services at the house or at the church. There had been some wild talk
      among the younger and many of the lower members of the community, notably
      the "poor" non-slave-holding whites, of tarring and feathering Joseph
      Corbin, and riding him on a rail out of the town on the day of the
      funeral, as a propitiatory sacrifice to the manes of Thomas Jeffcourt; but
      it being pointed out by the undertaker that it might involve some
      uncertainty in the settlement of his bill, together with some reasonable
      doubt of the thorough resignation of Corbin, whose previous momentary
      aberration in that respect they were celebrating, the project was
      postponed until AFTER THE FUNERAL. And here an unlooked-for incident
      occurred.
    
    
      There was to be a political meeting at Kirby on that day, when certain
      distinguished Southern leaders had gathered from the remoter Southern
      States. At the instigation of Captain Dows it was adjourned at the hour of
      the funeral to enable members to attend, and it was even rumored, to the
      great delight of Pineville, that a distinguished speaker or two might come
      over to "improve the occasion" with some slight allusion to the engrossing
      topic of "Southern Rights." This combined appeal to the domestic and
      political emotions of Pineville was irresistible. The Second Baptist
      Church was crowded. After the religious service there was a pause, and
      Judge Reed, stepping forward amid a breathless silence, said that they
      were peculiarly honored by the unexpected presence in their midst "of that
      famous son of the South, Colonel Starbottle," who had lately returned to
      his native soil from his adopted home in California. Every eye was fixed
      on the distinguished stranger as he rose.
    
    
      Jaunty and gallant as ever, femininely smooth-faced, yet polished and high
      colored as a youthful mask; pectorally expansive, and unfolding the white
      petals of his waistcoat through the swollen lapels of his coat, like a
      bursting magnolia bud, Colonel Starbottle began. The present associations
      were, he might say, singularly hallowed to him; not only was Pineville&mdash;a
      Southern centre&mdash;the recognized nursery of Southern chivalry,
      Southern beauty (a stately inclination to the pew in which Miss Sally and
      Julia Jeffcourt sat), Southern intelligence, and Southern independence,
      but it was the home of the lamented dead who had been, like himself and
      another he should refer to later, an adopted citizen of the Golden State,
      a seeker of the Golden Fleece, a companion of Jason. It was the home,
      fellow-citizens and friends, of the sorrowing sister of the deceased, a
      young lady whom he, the speaker, had as yet known only through the
      chivalrous blazon of her virtues and graces by her attendant knights (a
      courteous wave towards the gallery where Joyce Masterton, Chester Brooks,
      Calhoun Bungstarter, and the embattled youth generally of Pineville became
      empurpled and idiotic); it was the home of the afflicted widowed mother,
      also personally unknown to him, but with whom he might say he had had&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;professional
      correspondence. But it was not this alone that hallowed the occasion, it
      was a sentiment that should speak in trumpet-like tones throughout the
      South in this uprising of an united section. It was the forgetfulness of
      petty strife, of family feud, of personal wrongs in the claims of party!
      It might not be known that he, the speaker, was professionally cognizant
      of one of these regrettable&mdash;should he say accidents?&mdash;arising
      from the chivalrous challenge and equally chivalrous response of two fiery
      Southern spirits, to which they primarily owe their coming here that day.
      And he should take it as his duty, his solemn duty, in that sacred edifice
      to proclaim to the world that in his knowledge as a professional man&mdash;as
      a man of honor, as a Southerner, as a gentleman, that the&mdash;er&mdash;circumstances
      which three years ago led to the early demise of our lamented friend and
      brother, reflected only the highest credit equally on both of the parties.
      He said this on his own responsibility&mdash;in or out of this sacred
      edifice&mdash;and in or out of that sacred edifice he was personally
      responsible, and prepared to give the fullest satisfaction for it. He was
      also aware that it might not be known&mdash;or understood&mdash;that since
      that boyish episode the survivor had taken the place of the departed in
      the bereaved family and ministered to their needs with counsel and&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;pecuniary
      aid, and had followed the body afoot across the continent that it might
      rest with its kindred dust. He was aware that an unchristian&mdash;he
      would say but for that sacred edifice&mdash;a DASTARDLY attempt had been
      made to impugn the survivor's motives&mdash;to suggest an unseemly discord
      between him and the family, but he, the speaker, would never forget the
      letter breathing with Christian forgiveness and replete with angelic
      simplicity sent by a member of that family to his client, which came under
      his professional eye (here the professional eye for a moment lingered on
      the hysteric face of Miss Sally); he did not envy the head or heart of a
      man who could peruse these lines&mdash;of which the mere recollection&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;choked
      the utterance of even a professional man like&mdash;er&mdash;himself&mdash;without
      emotion. "And what, my friends and fellow-citizens," suddenly continued
      the Colonel, replacing his white handkerchief in his coat-tail, "was the
      reason why my client, Mr. Joseph Corbin&mdash;whose delicacy keeps him
      from appearing among these mourners&mdash;comes here to bury all
      differences, all animosities, all petty passions? Because he is a son of
      the South; because as a son of the South, as the representative, and a
      distant connection, I believe, of my old political friend, Major Corbin,
      of Nashville, he wishes here and everywhere, at this momentous crisis, to
      sink everything in the one all-pervading, all-absorbing, one and
      indivisible UNITY of the South in its resistance to the Northern Usurper!
      That, my friends, is the great, the solemn, the Christian lesson of this
      most remarkable occasion in my professional, political, and social
      experience."
    
    
      Whatever might have been the calmer opinion, there was no doubt that the
      gallant Colonel had changed the prevailing illogical emotion of Pineville
      by the substitution of another equally illogical, and Miss Sally was not
      surprised when her father, touched by the Colonel's allusion to his
      daughter's epistolary powers, insisted upon bringing Joseph Corbin home
      with him, and offering him the hospitality of the Dows mansion. Although
      the stranger seemed to yield rather from the fact that the Dows were
      relations of the Jeffcourts than from any personal preference, when he was
      fairly installed in one of the appropriately gloomy guest chambers, Miss
      Sally set about the delayed work of reconciliation&mdash;theoretically
      accepted by her father, and cynically tolerated by her Aunt Miranda. But
      here a difficulty arose which she had not foreseen. Although Corbin had
      evidently forgiven her defection on that memorable evening, he had not
      apparently got over the revelation of her giddy worldliness, and was
      resignedly apathetic and distrustful of her endeavors. She was at first
      amused, and then angry. And her patience was exhausted when she discovered
      that he actually seemed more anxious to conciliate Julia Jeffcourt than
      her mother.
    
    
      "But she spat in your face," she said, indignantly.
    
    
      "That's so," he replied, gloomily; "but I reckoned you said something in
      one of your letters about turning the other cheek when you were smitten.
      Of course, as you don't believe it now," he added with his upward glance,
      "I suppose THAT'S been played on me, too."
    
    
      But here Miss Sally's spirit lazily rebelled.
    
    
      "Look here, Mr. Joseph JEREMIAH Corbin," she returned with languid
      impertinence, "if instead of cavortin' round on yo' knees trying to
      conciliate an old woman who never had a stroke of luck till you killed her
      son, and a young girl who won't be above letting on afore you think it
      that your conciliatin' her means SPARKIN' her; if instead of that
      foolishness you'd turn your hand to trying to conciliate the folks here
      and keep 'em from going into that fool's act of breaking up these United
      States; if instead of digging up second-hand corpses that's already been
      put out of sight once you'd set to work to try and prevent the folks about
      here from digging up their old cranks and their old whims, and their old
      women fancies, you'd be doing something like a Christian and a man! What's
      yo' blood-guiltiness&mdash;I'd like to know&mdash;alongside of the
      blood-guiltiness of those fools who are just wild to rush into it, led by
      such turkey-cocks as yo' friend Colonel Starbottle? And you've been five
      years in California&mdash;a free State&mdash;and that's all yo' 've toted
      out of it&mdash;a dead body! There now, don't sit there and swing yo' hat
      under that chyar, but rouse out and come along with me to the pawty if you
      can shake a foot, and show Miss Pinkney and the gyrls yo' fit for
      something mo' than to skirmish round as a black japanned spittoon for
      Julia Jeffcourt!" It is not recorded that Corbin accepted this cheerful
      invitation, but for a few days afterwards he was more darkly observant of,
      and respectful to, Miss Sally. Strange indeed if he had not noticed&mdash;although
      always in his resigned fashion&mdash;the dull green stagnation of the life
      around him, or when not accepting it as part of his trouble he had not
      chafed at the arrested youth and senile childishness of the people.
      Stranger still if he had not at times been startled to hear the outgrown
      superstitions and follies of his youth voiced again by grown-up men, and
      perhaps strangest of all if he had not vaguely accepted it all as the
      hereditary curse of that barbarism under which he himself had survived and
      suffered.
    
    
      The reconciliation between himself and Mrs. Jeffcourt was superficially
      effected, so far as a daily visit by him to the house indicated it to the
      community, but it was also known that Julia was invariably absent on these
      occasions. What happened at those interviews did not transpire, but it may
      be surmised that Mrs. Jeffcourt, perhaps recognizing the fact that Corbin
      was really giving her all that he had to give, or possibly having some
      lurking fear of Colonel Starbottle, was so far placated as to exhibit only
      the average ingratitude of her species towards a regular benefactor. She
      consented to the erection of a small obelisk over her son's grave, and
      permitted Corbin to plant a few flowering shrubs, which he daily visited
      and took care of. It is said that on one of these pilgrimages he
      encountered Miss Julia, apparently on the same errand, who haughtily
      retired. It was further alleged, on the authority of one of Mammy Judy's
      little niggers, that those two black mourning figures had been seen at
      nightfall sitting opposite to each other at the head and foot of the
      grave, and "glowerin'" at one another "like two hants." But when it was
      asserted on the same authority that their voices had been later overheard
      uplifted in some vehement discussion over the grave of the impassive dead,
      great curiosity was aroused. Being pressed by the eager Miss Sally to
      repeat some words or any words he had heard them say, the little witness
      glibly replied, "Marse Linkum" (Lincoln), and "The Souf," and so, for the
      time, shipwrecked his testimony. But it was recalled six months
      afterwards. It was then that a pleasant spring day brought madness and
      enthusiasm to a majority of Pineville, and bated breath and awe to a few,
      and it was known with the tidings that the South had appealed to arms,
      that among those who had first responded to the call was Joseph Corbin, an
      alleged "Union man," who had, however, volunteered to take that place in
      her ranks which might HAVE BEEN FILLED BY THE MAN HE HAD KILLED. And then
      people forgot all about him.
    
    
    
      A year passed. It was the same place; the old familiar outlines of home
      and garden and landscape. But seen now, in the choking breathlessness of
      haste, in the fitful changing flashes of life and motion around it, in
      intervals of sharp suspense or dazed bewilderment, it seemed to be
      recognized no longer. Men who had known it all their lives, hurrying to
      the front in compact masses, scurrying to the rear in straggling line, or
      opening their ranks to let artillery gallop by, stared at it vaguely, and
      clattered or scrambled on again. The smoke of a masked battery in the
      woods struggled and writhed to free itself from the clinging treetops
      behind it, and sank back into a gray encompassing cloud. The dust thrown
      up by a column of passing horse poured over the wall in one long wave, and
      whitened the garden with its ashes. Throughout the dim empty house one no
      longer heard the sound of cannon, only a dull intermittent concussion was
      felt, silently bringing flakes of plaster from the walls, or sliding
      fragments of glass from the shattered windows. A shell, lifted from the
      ominous distance, hung uncertain in the air and then descended swiftly
      through the roof; the whole house dilated with flame for an instant, smoke
      rolled slowly from the windows, and even the desolate chimneys started
      into a hideous mockery of life, and then all was still again. At such
      awful intervals the sun shone out brightly, touched the green of the still
      sleeping woods and the red and white of a flower in the garden, and
      something in a gray uniform writhed out of the dust of the road, staggered
      to the wall, and died.
    
    
      A mile down this road, growing more and more obscure with those rising and
      falling apparitions or the shapeless and rugged heaps terrible in their
      helpless inertia by hedge and fence, arose the cemetery hill. Taken and
      retaken thrice that afternoon, the dead above it far outnumbered the dead
      below; and when at last the tide of battle swept around its base into the
      dull, reverberating woods, and it emerged from the smoke, silenced and
      abandoned, only a few stragglers remained. One of them, leaning on his
      musket, was still gloomily facing the woods.
    
    
      "Joseph Corbin," said a low, hurried voice.
    
    
      He started and glanced quickly at the tombs around him. Perhaps it was
      because he had been thinking of the dead,&mdash;but the voice sounded like
      HIS. Yet it was only the SISTER, who had glided, pale and haggard, from
      the thicket.
    
    
      "They are coming through the woods," she said quickly. "Run, or you'll be
      taken. Why do you linger?"
    
    
      "You know why," he said gloomily.
    
    
      "Yes, but you have done yo' duty. You have done his work. The task is
      finished now, and yo' free."
    
    
      He did not reply, but remained gazing at the woods.
    
    
      "Joseph," she said more gently, laying her trembling hand on his arm,
      "Joseph, fly&mdash;and&mdash;take me with you. For I was wrong, and I want
      you to forgive me. I knew your heart was not in this, and I ought not to
      have asked you. Joseph&mdash;listen! I never wanted to avenge myself nor
      HIM when I spat on your face. I wanted to avenge myself on HER. I hated
      her, because I thought she wanted to work upon you and use you for
      herself."
    
    
      "Your mother," he said, looking at her.
    
    
      "No," she said, with widely opened eyes, "you know who I mean&mdash;Miss
      Sally."
    
    
      He looked at her wonderingly for a moment, but quickly bent his head again
      in the direction of the road. "They are coming," he said, starting. "YOU
      must go. This is no place for you. Stop! it's too late; you cannot go now
      until they have passed. Come here&mdash;crouch down here&mdash;over this
      grave&mdash;so."
    
    
      He almost forced her&mdash;kneeling down&mdash;upon the mound below the
      level of the shrubs, and then ran quickly himself a few paces lower down
      the hill to a more exposed position. She understood it. He wished to
      attract attention to himself. He was successful&mdash;a few hurried shots
      followed from the road, but struck above him.
    
    
      He clambered back quickly to where she was still crouching.
    
    
      "They were the vedettes," he said, "but they have fallen back on the main
      skirmish line and will be here in force in a moment. Go&mdash;while you
      can." She had not moved. He tried to raise her&mdash;her hat fell off&mdash;-he
      saw blood oozing from where the vedette's bullet that had missed him had
      pierced her brain.
    
    
      And yet he saw in that pale dead face only the other face which he
      remembered now had been turned like this towards his own. It was very
      strange. And this was the end, and this was his expiation! He raised his
      own face humbly, blindly, despairingly to the inscrutable sky; it looked
      back upon him from above as coldly as the dead face had from below.
    
    
      Yet out of this he struck a faint idea that he voiced aloud in nearly the
      same words which he had used to Colonel Starbottle only three years ago.
      "It was with his own pistol too," he said, and took up his musket.
    
    
      He walked deliberately down the hill, occasionally trying the stock of his
      musket in the loose earth, and at last suddenly remained motionless, in
      the attitude of leaning over it. At the same moment there was a distant
      shout; two thin parallel streams of blue and steel came issuing through
      the woods like a river, appeared to join tumultuously in the open before
      the hill, and out of the tumult a mounted officer called upon him to
      surrender.
    
    
      He did not reply.
    
    
      "Come down from there, Johnny Reb, I want to speak to you," called a young
      corporal.
    
    
      He did not move.
    
    
      "It's time to go home, Johnny."
    
    
      No response.
    
    
      The officer, who had been holding down his men with an unsworded but
      masterful hand, raised it suddenly. A dozen shots followed. The men leaped
      forward, and dashing Corbin contemptuously aside streamed up the hill past
      him.
    
    
      But he had neither heard nor cared. For they found he had already
      deliberately transfixed himself through the heart on his own bayonet.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      THE POSTMISTRESS OF LAUREL RUN.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER I.
    
    
      The mail stage had just passed Laurel Run,&mdash;so rapidly that the
      whirling cloud of dust dragged with it down the steep grade from the
      summit hung over the level long after the stage had vanished, and then,
      drifting away, slowly sifted a red precipitate over the hot platform of
      the Laurel Run post-office.
    
    
      Out of this cloud presently emerged the neat figure of the postmistress
      with the mailbag which had been dexterously flung at her feet from the top
      of the passing vehicle. A dozen loungers eagerly stretched out their hands
      to assist her, but the warning: "It's agin the rules, boys, for any but
      her to touch it," from a bystander, and a coquettish shake of the head
      from the postmistress herself&mdash;much more effective than any official
      interdict&mdash;withheld them. The bag was not heavy,&mdash;Laurel Run was
      too recent a settlement to have attracted much correspondence,&mdash;and
      the young woman, having pounced upon her prey with a certain feline
      instinct, dragged it, not without difficulty, behind the partitioned
      inclosure in the office, and locked the door. Her pretty face, momentarily
      visible through the window, was slightly flushed with the exertion, and
      the loose ends of her fair hair, wet with perspiration, curled themselves
      over her forehead into tantalizing little rings. But the window shutter
      was quickly closed, and this momentary but charming vision withdrawn from
      the waiting public.
    
    
      "Guv'ment oughter have more sense than to make a woman pick mail-bags
      outer the road," said Jo Simmons sympathetically. "'Tain't in her day's
      work anyhow; Guv'mont oughter hand 'em over to her like a lady; it's rich
      enough and ugly enough."
    
    
      "'Tain't Guv'ment; it's that stage company's airs and graces," interrupted
      a newcomer. "They think it mighty fine to go beltin' by, makin' everybody
      take their dust, just because STOPPIN' ain't in their contract. Why, if
      that expressman who chucked down the bag had any feelin's for a lady"&mdash;but
      he stopped here at the amused faces of his auditors.
    
    
      "Guess you don't know much o' that expressman's feelin's, stranger," said
      Simmons grimly. "Why, you oughter see him just nussin' that bag like a
      baby as he comes tearin' down the grade, and then rise up and sorter heave
      it to Mrs. Baker ez if it was a five-dollar bokay! His feelin's for her!
      Why, he's give himself so dead away to her that we're looking for him to
      forget what he's doin' next, and just come sailin' down hisself at her
      feet."
    
    
      Meanwhile, on the other side of the partition, Mrs. Baker had brushed the
      red dust from the padlocked bag, and removed what seemed to be a
      supplementary package attached to it by a wire. Opening it she found a
      handsome scent-bottle, evidently a superadded gift from the devoted
      expressman. This she put aside with a slight smile and the murmured word,
      "Foolishness." But when she had unlocked the bag, even its sacred interior
      was also profaned by a covert parcel from the adjacent postmaster at Burnt
      Ridge, containing a gold "specimen" brooch and some circus tickets. It was
      laid aside with the other. This also was vanity and&mdash;presumably&mdash;vexation
      of spirit.
    
    
      There were seventeen letters in all, of which five were for herself&mdash;and
      yet the proportion was small that morning. Two of them were marked
      "Official Business" and were promptly put by with feminine discernment;
      but in another compartment than that holding the presents. Then the
      shutter was opened, and the task of delivery commenced.
    
    
      It was accompanied with a social peculiarity that had in time become a
      habit of Laurel Run. As the young woman delivered the letters, in turn, to
      the men who were patiently drawn up in Indian file, she made that simple
      act a medium of privileged but limited conversation on special or general
      topics,&mdash;gay or serious as the case might be, or the temperament of
      the man suggested. That it was almost always of a complimentary character
      on their part may be readily imagined; but it was invariably characterized
      by an element of refined restraint, and, whether from some implied
      understanding or individual sense of honour, it never passed the bounds of
      conventionality or a certain delicacy of respect. The delivery was
      consequently more or less protracted, but when each man had exchanged his
      three or four minutes' conversation with the fair postmistress,&mdash;a
      conversation at times impeded by bashfulness or timidity, on his part
      solely, or restricted often to vague smiling,&mdash;he resignedly made way
      for the next. It was a formal levee, mitigated by the informality of
      rustic tact, great good-humor, and infinite patience, and would have been
      amusing had it not always been terribly in earnest and at times touching.
      For it was peculiar to the place and the epoch, and indeed implied the
      whole history of Mrs. Baker.
    
    
      She was the wife of John Baker, foreman of "The Last Chance," now for a
      year lying dead under half a mile of crushed and beaten-in tunnel at Burnt
      Ridge. There had been a sudden outcry from the depths at high hot noontide
      one day, and John had rushed from his cabin&mdash;his young, foolish,
      flirting wife clinging to him&mdash;to answer that despairing cry of his
      imprisoned men. There was one exit that he alone knew which might be yet
      held open, among falling walls and tottering timbers, long enough to set
      them free. For one moment only the strong man hesitated between her
      entreating arms and his brothers' despairing cry. But she rose suddenly
      with a pale face, and said, "Go, John; I will wait for you here." He went,
      the men were freed&mdash;but she had waited for him ever since!
    
    
      Yet in the shock of the calamity and in the after struggles of that
      poverty which had come to the ruined camp, she had scarcely changed. But
      the men had. Although she was to all appearances the same giddy, pretty
      Betsy Baker, who had been so disturbing to the younger members, they
      seemed to be no longer disturbed by her. A certain subdued awe and
      respect, as if the martyred spirit of John Baker still held his arm around
      her, appeared to have come upon them all. They held their breath as this
      pretty woman, whose brief mourning had not seemed to affect her
      cheerfulness or even playfulness of spirit, passed before them. But she
      stood by her cabin and the camp&mdash;the only woman in a settlement of
      forty men&mdash;during the darkest hours of their fortune. Helping them to
      wash and cook, and ministering to their domestic needs, the sanctity of
      her cabin was, however, always kept as inviolable as if it had been HIS
      tomb. No one exactly knew why, for it was only a tacit instinct; but even
      one or two who had not scrupled to pay court to Betsy Baker during John
      Baker's life, shrank from even a suggestion of familiarity towards the
      woman who had said that she would "wait for him there."
    
    
      When brighter days came and the settlement had increased by one or two
      families, and laggard capital had been hurried up to relieve the still
      beleaguered and locked-up wealth of Burnt Ridge, the needs of the
      community and the claims of the widow of John Baker were so well told in
      political quarters that the post-office of Laurel Run was created
      expressly for her. Every man participated in the building of the pretty
      yet substantial edifice&mdash;the only public building of Laurel Run&mdash;that
      stood in the dust of the great highway, half a mile from the settlement.
      There she was installed for certain hours of the day, for she could not be
      prevailed upon to abandon John's cabin, and here, with all the added
      respect due to a public functionary, she was secure in her privacy.
    
    
      But the blind devotion of Laurel Run to John Baker's relict did not stop
      here. In its zeal to assure the Government authorities of the necessity
      for a post-office, and to secure a permanent competency to the
      postmistress, there was much embarrassing extravagance. During the first
      week the sale of stamps at Laurel Run post-office was unprecedented in the
      annals of the Department. Fancy prices were given for the first issue;
      then they were bought wildly, recklessly, unprofitably, and on all
      occasions. Complimentary congratulation at the little window invariably
      ended with "and a dollar's worth of stamps, Mrs. Baker." It was felt to be
      supremely delicate to buy only the highest priced stamps, without
      reference to their adequacy; then mere QUANTITY was sought; then outgoing
      letters were all over-paid and stamped in outrageous proportion to their
      weight and even size. The imbecility of this, and its probable effect on
      the reputation of Laurel Run at the General Post-office, being pointed out
      by Mrs. Baker, stamps were adopted as local currency, and even for
      decorative purposes on mirrors and the walls of cabins. Everybody wrote
      letters, with the result, however, that those SENT were ludicrously and
      suspiciously in excess of those received. To obviate this, select parties
      made forced journeys to Hickory Hill, the next post-office, with letters
      and circulars addressed to themselves at Laurel Run. How long the
      extravagance would have continued is not known, but it was not until it
      was rumored that, in consequence of this excessive flow of business, the
      Department had concluded that a postMASTER would be better fitted for the
      place that it abated, and a compromise was effected with the General
      Office by a permanent salary to the postmistress.
    
    
      Such was the history of Mrs. Baker, who had just finished her afternoon
      levee, nodded a smiling "good-by" to her last customer, and closed her
      shutter again. Then she took up her own letters, but, before reading them,
      glanced, with a pretty impatience, at the two official envelopes addressed
      to herself, which she had shelved. They were generally a "lot of new
      rules," or notifications, or "absurd" questions which had nothing to do
      with Laurel Run and only bothered her and "made her head ache," and she had
      usually referred them to her admiring neighbor at Hickory Hill for
      explanation, who had generally returned them to her with the brief
      indorsement, "Purp stuff, don't bother," or, "Hog wash, let it slide." She
      remembered now that he had not returned the last two. With knitted brows
      and a slight pout she put aside her private correspondence and tore open
      the first one. It referred with official curtness to an unanswered
      communication of the previous week, and was "compelled to remind her of
      rule 47." Again those horrid rules! She opened the other; the frown
      deepened on her brow, and became fixed.
    
    
      It was a summary of certain valuable money letters that had miscarried on
      the route, and of which they had given her previous information. For a
      moment her cheeks blazed. How dare they; what did they mean! Her waybills
      and register were always right; she knew the names of every man, woman,
      and child in her district; no such names as those borne by the missing
      letters had ever existed at Laurel Run; no such addresses had ever been
      sent from Laurel Run post-office. It was a mean insinuation! She would
      send in her resignation at once! She would get "the boys" to write an
      insulting letter to Senator Slocumb,&mdash;Mrs. Baker had the feminine
      idea of Government as a purely personal institution,&mdash;and she would
      find out who it was that had put them up to this prying, crawling
      impudence! It was probably that wall-eyed old wife of the postmaster at
      Heavy Tree Crossing, who was jealous of her. "Remind her of their previous
      unanswered communication," indeed! Where was that communication, anyway?
      She remembered she had sent it to her admirer at Hickory Hill. Odd that he
      hadn't answered it. Of course, he knew about this meanness&mdash;could he,
      too, have dared to suspect her! The thought turned her crimson again. He,
      Stanton Green, was an old "Laurel Runner," a friend of John's, a little
      "triflin'" and "presoomin'," but still an old loyal pioneer of the camp!
      "Why hadn't he spoke up?"
    
    
      There was the soft, muffled fall of a horse's hoof in the thick dust of
      the highway, the jingle of dismounting spurs, and a firm tread on the
      platform. No doubt one of the boys returning for a few supplemental
      remarks under the feeble pretense of forgotten stamps. It had been done
      before, and she had resented it as "cayotin' round;" but now she was eager
      to pour out her wrongs to the first comer. She had her hand impulsively on
      the door of the partition, when she stopped with a new sense of her
      impaired dignity. Could she confess this to her worshipers? But here the
      door opened in her very face, and a stranger entered.
    
    
      He was a man of fifty, compactly and strongly built. A squarely-cut
      goatee, slightly streaked with gray, fell straight from his thin-lipped
      but handsome mouth; his eyes were dark, humorous, yet searching. But the
      distinctive quality that struck Mrs Baker was the blending of urban ease
      with frontier frankness. He was evidently a man who had seen cities and
      knew countries as well. And while he was dressed with the comfortable
      simplicity of a Californian mounted traveler, her inexperienced but
      feminine eye detected the keynote of his respectability in the
      carefully-tied bow of his cravat. The Sierrean throat was apt to be open,
      free, and unfettered.
    
    
      "Good-morning, Mrs. Baker," he said, pleasantly, with his hat already in
      his hand, "I'm Harry Home, of San Francisco." As he spoke his eye swept
      approvingly over the neat inclosure, the primly-tied papers, and well-kept
      pigeon-holes; the pot of flowers on her desk; her china-silk mantle, and
      killing little chip hat and ribbons hanging against the wall; thence to
      her own pink, flushed face, bright blue eyes, tendriled clinging hair, and
      then&mdash;fell upon the leathern mailbag still lying across the table.
      Here it became fixed on the unfortunate wire of the amorous expressman
      that yet remained hanging from the brass wards of the lock, and he reached
      his hand toward it.
    
    
      But little Mrs. Baker was before him, and had seized it in her arms. She
      had been too preoccupied and bewildered to resent his first intrusion
      behind the partition, but this last familiarity with her sacred official
      property&mdash;albeit empty&mdash;capped the climax of her wrongs.
    
    
      "How dare you touch it!" she said indignantly. "How dare you come in here!
      Who are you, anyway? Go outside, at once!"
    
    
      The stranger fell back with an amused, deprecatory gesture, and a long
      silent laugh. "I'm afraid you don't know me, after all!" he said
      pleasantly. "I'm Harry Home, the Department Agent from the San Francisco
      office. My note of advice, No. 201, with my name on the envelope, seems to
      have miscarried too."
    
    
      Even in her fright and astonishment it flashed upon Mrs. Baker that she
      had sent that notice, too, to Hickory Hill. But with it all the feminine
      secretive instinct within her was now thoroughly aroused, and she kept
      silent.
    
    
      "I ought to have explained," he went on smilingly; "but you are quite
      right, Mrs. Baker," he added, nodding towards the bag. "As far as you
      knew, I had no business to go near it. Glad to see you know how to defend
      Uncle Sam's property so well. I was only a bit puzzled to know" (pointing
      to the wire) "if that thing was on the bag when it was delivered to you?"
    
    
      Mrs. Baker saw no reason to conceal the truth. After all, this official
      was a man like the others, and it was just as well that he should
      understand her power. "It's only the expressman's foolishness," she said,
      with a slightly coquettish toss of her head. "He thinks it smart to tie
      some nonsense on that bag with the wire when he flings it down."
    
    
      Mr. Home, with his eyes on her pretty face, seemed to think it a not
      inhuman or unpardonable folly. "As long as he doesn't meddle with the
      inside of the bag, I suppose you must put up with it," he said laughingly.
      A dreadful recollection, that the Hickory Hill postmaster had used the
      inside of the bag to convey HIS foolishness, came across her. It would
      never do to confess it now. Her face must have shown some agitation, for
      the official resumed with a half-paternal, half-reassuring air: "But
      enough of this. Now, Mrs. Baker, to come to my business here. Briefly,
      then, it doesn't concern you in the least, except so far as it may relieve
      you and some others, whom the Department knows equally well, from a
      certain responsibility, and, perhaps, anxiety. We are pretty well posted
      down there in all that concerns Laurel Run, and I think" (with a slight
      bow) "we've known all about you and John Baker. My only business here is
      to take your place to-night in receiving the 'Omnibus Way Bag,' that you
      know arrives here at 9.30, doesn't it?"
    
    
      "Yes, sir," said Mrs. Baker hurriedly; "but it never has anything for us,
      except"&mdash;(she caught herself up quickly, with a stammer, as she
      remembered the sighing Green's occasional offerings) "except a
      notification from Hickory Hill post-office. It leaves there," she went on
      with an affectation of precision, "at half past eight exactly, and it's
      about an hour's run&mdash;seven miles by road."
    
    
      "Exactly," said Mr. Home. "Well, I will receive the bag, open it, and
      dispatch it again. You can, if you choose, take a holiday."
    
    
      "But," said Mrs. Baker, as she remembered that Laurel Run always made a
      point of attending her evening levee on account of the superior leisure it
      offered, "there are the people who come for letters, you know."
    
    
      "I thought you said there were no letters at that time," said Mr. Home
      quickly.
    
    
      "No&mdash;but&mdash;but"&mdash;(with a slight hysterical stammer) "the
      boys come all the same."
    
    
      "Oh!" said Mr. Home dryly.
    
    
      "And&mdash;O Lord!"&mdash;But here the spectacle of the possible
      discomfiture of Laurel Run at meeting the bearded face of Mr. Home,
      instead of her own smooth cheeks, at the window, combined with her nervous
      excitement, overcame her so that, throwing her little frilled apron over
      her head, she gave way to a paroxym of hysterical laughter. Mr. Home
      waited with amused toleration for it to stop, and, when she had recovered,
      resumed. "Now, I should like to refer an instant to my first communication
      to you. Have you got it handy?"
    
    
      Mrs. Baker's face fell. "No; I sent it over to Mr. Green, of Hickory Hill,
      for information."
    
    
      "What!"
    
    
      Terrified at the sudden seriousness of the man's voice, she managed to
      gasp out, however, that, after her usual habit, she had not opened the
      official letters, but had sent them to her more experienced colleague for
      advice and information; that she never could understand them herself,&mdash;they
      made her head ache, and interfered with her other duties,&mdash;but HE
      understood them, and sent her word what to do. Remembering also his usual
      style of indorsement, she grew red again.
    
    
      "And what did he say?"
    
    
      "Nothing; he didn't return them."
    
    
      "Naturally," said Mr. Home, with a peculiar expression. After a few
      moments' silent stroking of his beard, he suddenly faced the frightened
      woman.
    
    
      "You oblige me, Mrs. Baker, to speak more frankly to you than I had
      intended. You have&mdash;unwittingly, I believe&mdash;given information to
      a man whom the Government suspects of peculation. You have, without
      knowing it, warned the postmaster at Hickory Hill that he is suspected;
      and, as you might have frustrated our plans for tracing a series of
      embezzlements to their proper source, you will see that you might have
      also done great wrong to yourself as his only neighbor and the next
      responsible person. In plain words, we have traced the disappearance of
      money letters to a point when it lies between these two offices. Now, I
      have not the least hesitation in telling you that we do not suspect Laurel
      Run, and never have suspected it. Even the result of your thoughtless act,
      although it warned him, confirms our suspicion of his guilt. As to the
      warning, it has failed, or he has grown reckless, for another letter has
      been missed since. To-night, however, will settle all doubt in the matter.
      When I open that bag in this office to-night, and do not find a certain
      decoy letter in it, which was last checked at Heavy Tree Crossing, I shall
      know that it remains in Green's possession at Hickory Hill."
    
    
      She was sitting back in her chair, white and breathless. He glanced at her
      kindly, and then took up his hat. "Come, Mrs. Baker, don't let this worry
      you. As I told you at first, YOU have nothing to fear. Even your
      thoughtlessness and ignorance of rules have contributed to show your own
      innocence. Nobody will ever be the wiser for this; we do not advertise our
      affairs in the Department. Not a soul but yourself knows the real cause of
      my visit here. I will leave you here alone for a while, so as to divert
      any suspicion. You will come, as usual, this evening, and be seen by your
      friends; I will only be here when the bag arrives, to open it. Good-by,
      Mrs. Baker; it's a nasty bit of business, but it's all in the day's work.
      I've seen worse, and, thank God, you're out of it."
    
    
      She heard his footsteps retreat into the outer office and die out of the
      platform; the jingle of his spurs, and the hollow beat of his horse's
      hoofs that seemed to find a dull echo in her own heart, and she was alone.
    
    
      The room was very hot and very quiet; she could hear the warping and
      creaking of the shingles under the relaxing of the nearly level sunbeams.
      The office clock struck seven. In the breathless silence that followed, a
      woodpecker took up his interrupted work on the roof, and seemed to beat
      out monotonously on her ear the last words of the stranger: Stanton Green&mdash;a
      thief! Stanton Green, one of the "boys" John had helped out of the falling
      tunnel! Stanton Green, whose old mother in the States still wrote letters
      to him at Laurel Run, in a few hours to be a disgraced and ruined man
      forever! She remembered now, as a thoughtless woman remembers, tales of
      his extravagance and fast living, of which she had taken no heed, and,
      with a sense of shame, of presents sent her, that she now clearly saw must
      have been far beyond his means. What would the boys say? What would John
      have said? Ah! what would John have DONE!
    
    
      She started suddenly to her feet, white and cold as on that day that she
      had parted from John Baker before the tunnel. She put on her hat and
      mantle, and going to that little iron safe that stood in the corner,
      unlocked it and took out its entire contents of gold and silver. She had
      reached the door when another idea seized her, and opening her desk she
      collected her stamps to the last sheet, and hurriedly rolled them up under
      her cape. Then with a glance at the clock, and a rapid survey of the road
      from the platform, she slipped from it, and seemed to be swallowed up in
      the waiting woods beyond.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II.
    
    
      Once within the friendly shadows of the long belt of pines, Mrs. Baker
      kept them until she had left the limited settlement of Laurel Run far to
      the right, and came upon an open slope of Burnt Ridge, where she knew Jo
      Simmons' mustang, Blue Lightning, would be quietly feeding. She had often
      ridden him before, and when she had detached the fifty-foot reata from his
      head-stall, he permitted her the further recognized familiarity of twining
      her fingers in his bluish mane and climbing on his back. The tool-shed of
      Burnt Ridge Tunnel, where Jo's saddle and bridle always hung, was but a
      canter farther on. She reached it unperceived, and&mdash;another trick of
      the old days&mdash;quickly extemporized a side-saddle from Simmons'
      Mexican tree, with its high cantle and horn bow, and the aid of a blanket.
      Then leaping to her seat, she rapidly threw off her mantle, tied it by its
      sleeves around her waist, tucked it under one knee, and let it fall over
      her horse's flanks. By this time Blue Lightning was also struck with a
      flash of equine recollection and pricked up his ears. Mrs. Baker uttered a
      little chirping cry which he remembered, and the next moment they were
      both careering over the Ridge.
    
    
      The trail that she had taken, though precipitate, difficult, and dangerous
      in places, was a clear gain of two miles on the stage road. There was less
      chance of her being followed or meeting any one. The greater canyons were
      already in shadow; the pines on the farther ridges were separating their
      masses, and showing individual silhouettes against the sky, but the air
      was still warm, and the cool breath of night, as she well knew it, had not
      yet begun to flow down the mountain. The lower range of Burnt Ridge was
      still uneclipsed by the creeping shadow of the mountain ahead of her.
      Without a watch, but with this familiar and slowly changing dial spread
      out before her, she knew the time to a minute. Heavy Tree Hill, a lesser
      height in the distance, was already wiped out by that shadowy index finger&mdash;half
      past seven! The stage would be at Hickory Hill just before half past
      eight; she ought to anticipate it, if possible,&mdash;it would stay ten
      minutes to change horses,&mdash;she MUST arrive before it left!
    
    
      There was a good two-mile level before the rise of the next range. Now,
      Blue Lightning! all you know! And that was much,&mdash;for with the little
      chip hat and fluttering ribbons well bent down over the bluish mane, and
      the streaming gauze of her mantle almost level with the horse's back, she
      swept down across the long tableland like a skimming blue-jay. A few more
      bird-like dips up and down the undulations, and then came the long, cruel
      ascent of the Divide.
    
    
      Acrid with perspiration, caking with dust, slithering in the slippery,
      impalpable powder of the road, groggily staggering in a red dusty dream,
      coughing, snorting, head-tossing; becoming suddenly dejected, with
      slouching haunch and limp legs on easy slopes, or wildly spasmodic and
      agile on sharp acclivities, Blue Lightning began to have ideas and
      recollections! Ah! she was a devil for a lark&mdash;this lightly-clinging,
      caressing, blarneying, cooing creature&mdash;up there! He remembered her
      now. Ha! very well then. Hoop-la! And suddenly leaping out like a rabbit,
      bucking, trotting hard, ambling lightly, "loping" on three legs and
      recreating himself,&mdash;as only a California mustang could,&mdash;the
      invincible Blue Lightning at last stood triumphantly upon the summit. The
      evening star had just pricked itself through the golden mist of the
      horizon line,&mdash;eight o'clock! She could do it now! But here,
      suddenly, her first hesitation seized her. She knew her horse, she knew
      the trail, she knew herself,&mdash;but did she know THE MAN to whom she
      was riding? A cold chill crept over her, and then she shivered in a sudden
      blast; it was Night at last swooping down from the now invisible Sierras,
      and possessing all it touched. But it was only one long descent to Hickory
      Hill now, and she swept down securely on its wings. Half-past eight! The
      lights of the settlement were just ahead of her&mdash;but so, too, were
      the two lamps of the waiting stage before the post-office and hotel.
    
    
      Happily the lounging crowd were gathered around the hotel, and she slipped
      into the post-office from the rear, unperceived. As she stepped behind the
      partition, its only occupant&mdash;a good-looking young fellow with a
      reddish mustache&mdash;turned towards her with a flush of delighted
      surprise. But it changed at the sight of the white, determined face and
      the brilliant eyes that had never looked once towards him, but were fixed
      upon a large bag, whose yawning mouth was still open and propped up beside
      his desk.
    
    
      "Where is the through money letter that came in that bag?" she said
      quickly.
    
    
      "What&mdash;do&mdash;you&mdash;mean?" he stammered, with a face that had
      suddenly grown whiter than her own.
    
    
      "I mean that it's a DECOY, checked at Heavy Tree Crossing, and that Mr.
      Home, of San Francisco, is now waiting at my office to know if you have
      taken it!"
    
    
      The laugh and lie that he had at first tried to summon to mouth and lips
      never reached them. For, under the spell of her rigid, truthful face, he
      turned almost mechanically to his desk, and took out a package.
    
    
      "Good God! you've opened it already!" she cried, pointing to the broken
      seal.
    
    
      The expression on her face, more than anything she had said, convinced him
      that she knew all. He stammered under the new alarm that her despairing
      tone suggested. "Yes!&mdash;I was owing some bills&mdash;the collector was
      waiting here for the money, and I took something from the packet. But I
      was going to make it up by next mail&mdash;I swear it."
    
    
      "How much have you taken?"
    
    
      "Only a trifle. I"&mdash;
    
    
      "How much?"
    
    
      "A hundred dollars!"
    
    
      She dragged the money she had brought from Laurel Run from her pocket, and
      counting out the sum, replaced it in the open package. He ran quickly to
      get the sealing wax, but she motioned him away as she dropped the package
      back into the mail-bag. "No; as long as the money is found in the bag the
      package may have been broken ACCIDENTALLY. Now burst open one or two of
      those other packages a little&mdash;so;" she took out a packet of letters
      and bruised their official wrappings under her little foot until the tape
      fastening was loosened. "Now give me something heavy." She caught up a
      brass two-pound weight, and in the same feverish but collected haste
      wrapped it in paper, sealed it, stamped it, and, addressing it in a large
      printed hand to herself at Laurel Hill, dropped it in the bag. Then she
      closed it and locked it; he would have assisted her, but she again waved
      him away. "Send for the expressman, and keep yourself out of the way for a
      moment," she said curtly.
    
    
      An attitude of weak admiration and foolish passion had taken the place of
      his former tremulous fear. He obeyed excitedly, but without a word. Mrs.
      Baker wiped her moist forehead and parched lips, and shook out her skirt.
      Well might the young expressman start at the unexpected revelation of
      those sparkling eyes and that demurely smiling mouth at the little window.
    
    
      "Mrs. Baker!"
    
    
      She put her finger quickly to her lips, and threw a world of unutterable
      and enigmatical meaning into her mischievous face.
    
    
      "There's a big San Francisco swell takin' my place at Laurel to-night,
      Charley."
    
    
      "Yes, ma'am."
    
    
      "And it's a pity that the Omnibus Way Bag happened to get such a shaking
      up and banging round already, coming here."
    
    
      "Eh?"
    
    
      "I say," continued Mrs. Baker, with great gravity and dancing eyes, "that
      it would be just AWFUL if that keerful city clerk found things kinder
      mixed up inside when he comes to open it. I wouldn't give him trouble for
      the world, Charley."
    
    
      "No, ma'am, it ain't like you."
    
    
      "So you'll be particularly careful on MY account."
    
    
      "Mrs. Baker," said Charley, with infinite gravity, "if that bag SHOULD
      TUMBLE OFF A DOZEN TIMES between this and Laurel Hill, I'll hop down and
      pick it up myself."
    
    
      "Thank you! shake!"
    
    
      They shook hands gravely across the window-ledge.
    
    
      "And you ain't going down with us, Mrs. Baker?"
    
    
      "Of course not; it wouldn't do,&mdash;for I AIN'T HERE,&mdash;don't you
      see?"
    
    
      "Of course!"
    
    
      She handed him the bag through the door. He took it carefully, but in
      spite of his great precaution fell over it twice on his way to the road,
      where from certain exclamations and shouts it seemed that a like miserable
      mischance attended its elevation to the boot. Then Mrs. Baker came back
      into the office, and, as the wheels rolled away, threw herself into a
      chair, and inconsistently gave way for the first time to an outburst of
      tears. Then her hand was grasped suddenly and she found Green on his knees
      before her. She started to her feet.
    
    
      "Don't move," he said, with weak hysteric passion, "but listen to me, for
      God's sake! I am ruined, I know, even though you have just saved me from
      detection and disgrace. I have been mad!&mdash;a fool, to do what I have
      done, I know, but you do not know all&mdash;you do not know why I did it&mdash;you
      cannot think of the temptation that has driven me to it. Listen, Mrs.
      Baker. I have been striving to get money, honestly, dishonestly&mdash;any
      way, to look well in YOUR eyes&mdash;to make myself worthy of you&mdash;to
      make myself rich, and to be able to offer you a home and take you away
      from Laurel Run. It was all for YOU, it was all for love of YOU, Betsy, my
      darling. Listen to me!"
    
    
      In the fury, outraged sensibility, indignation, and infinite disgust that
      filled her little body at that moment, she should have been large,
      imperious, goddess-like, and commanding. But God is at times ironical with
      suffering womanhood. She could only writhe her hand from his grasp with
      childish contortions; she could only glare at him with eyes that were
      prettily and piquantly brilliant; she could only slap at his detaining
      hand with a plump and velvety palm, and when she found her voice it was
      high falsetto. And all she could say was, "Leave me be, looney, or I'll
      scream!"
    
    
      He rose, with a weak, confused laugh, half of miserable affectation and
      half of real anger and shame.
    
    
      "What did you come riding over here for, then? What did you take all this
      risk for? Why did you rush over here to share my disgrace&mdash;for YOU
      are as much mixed up with this now as I am&mdash;if you didn't calculate
      to share EVERYTHING ELSE with me? What did you come here for, then, if not
      for ME?"
    
    
      "What did I come here for?" said Mrs. Baker, with every drop of red blood
      gone from her cheek and trembling lip. "What&mdash;did&mdash;I&mdash;come
      here for? Well!&mdash;I came here for JOHN BAKER'S sake! John Baker, who
      stood between you and death at Burnt Ridge, as I stand between you and
      damnation at Laurel Run, Mr. Green! Yes, John Baker, lying under half of
      Burnt Ridge, but more to me this day than any living man crawling over it&mdash;in&mdash;in"&mdash;oh,
      fatal climax!&mdash;"in a month o' Sundays! What did I come here for? I
      came here as John Baker's livin' wife to carry on dead John Baker's work.
      Yes, dirty work this time, may be, Mr. Green! but his work and for HIM
      only&mdash;precious! That's what I came here for; that's what I LIVE for;
      that's what I'm waiting for&mdash;to be up to HIM and his work always!
      That's me&mdash;Betsy Baker!"
    
    
      She walked up and down rapidly, tying her chip hat under her chin again.
      Then she stopped, and taking her chamois purse from her pocket, laid it
      sharply on the desk.
    
    
      "Stanton Green, don't be a fool! Rise up out of this, and be a man again.
      Take enough out o' that bag to pay what you owe Gov'ment, send in your
      resignation, and keep the rest to start you in an honest life elsewhere.
      But light out o' Hickory Hill afore this time to-morrow."
    
    
      She pulled her mantle from the wall and opened the door.
    
    
      "You are going?" he said bitterly.
    
    
      "Yes." Either she could not hold seriousness long in her capricious little
      fancy, or, with feminine tact, she sought to make the parting less
      difficult for him, for she broke into a dazzling smile. "Yes, I'm goin' to
      run Blue Lightning agin Charley and that way bag back to Laurel Run, and
      break the record."
    
    
    
      It is said that she did! Perhaps owing to the fact that the grade of the
      return journey to Laurel Run was in her favor, and that she could avoid
      the long, circuitous ascent to the summit taken by the stage, or that,
      owing to the extraordinary difficulties in the carriage of the way bag,&mdash;which
      had to be twice rescued from under the wheels of the stage,&mdash;she
      entered the Laurel Run post-office as the coach leaders came trotting up
      the hill. Mr. Home was already on the platform.
    
    
      "You'll have to ballast your next way bag, boss," said Charley, gravely,
      as it escaped his clutches once more in the dust of the road, "or you'll
      have to make a new contract with the company. We've lost ten minutes in
      five miles over that bucking thing."
    
    
      Home did not reply, but quickly dragged his prize into the office,
      scarcely noticing Mrs. Baker, who stood beside him pale and breathless. As
      the bolt of the bag was drawn, revealing its chaotic interior, Mrs. Baker
      gave a little sigh. Home glanced quickly at her, emptied the bag upon the
      floor, and picked up the broken and half-filled money parcel. Then he
      collected the scattered coins and counted them. "It's all right, Mrs.
      Baker," he said gravely. "HE'S safe this time."
    
    
      "I'm so glad!" said little Mrs. Baker, with a hypocritical gasp.
    
    
      "So am I," returned Home, with increasing gravity, as he took the coin,
      "for, from all I have gathered this afternoon, it seems he was an old
      pioneer of Laurel Run, a friend of your husband's, and, I think, more fool
      than knave!" He was silent for a moment, clicking the coins against each
      other; then he said carelessly: "Did he get quite away, Mrs. Baker?"
    
    
      "I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about," said Mrs. Baker, with a
      lofty air of dignity, but a somewhat debasing color. "I don't see why I
      should know anything about it, or why he should go away at all."
    
    
      "Well," said Mr. Home, laying his hand gently on the widow's shoulder,
      "well, you see, it might have occurred to his friends that the COINS WERE
      MARKED! That is, no doubt, the reason why he would take their good advice
      and go. But, as I said before, Mrs. Baker, YOU'RE all right, whatever
      happens,&mdash;the Government stands by YOU!"
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      A NIGHT AT "HAYS."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER I.
    
    
      It was difficult to say if Hays' farmhouse, or "Hays," as it was
      familiarly called, looked any more bleak and cheerless that winter
      afternoon than it usually did in the strong summer sunshine. Painted a
      cold merciless white, with scant projections for shadows, a roof of
      white-pine shingles, bleached lighter through sun and wind, and covered
      with low, white-capped chimneys, it looked even more stark and chilly than
      the drifts which had climbed its low roadside fence, and yet seemed
      hopeless of gaining a foothold on the glancing walls, or slippery,
      wind-swept roof. The storm, which had already heaped the hollows of the
      road with snow, hurled its finely-granulated flakes against the building,
      but they were whirled along the gutters and ridges, and disappeared in
      smokelike puffs across the icy roof. The granite outcrop in the hilly
      field beyond had long ago whitened and vanished; the dwarf firs and
      larches which had at first taken uncouth shapes in the drift blended
      vaguely together, and then merged into an unbroken formless wave. But the
      gaunt angles and rigid outlines of the building remained sharp and
      unchanged. It would seem as if the rigors of winter had only accented
      their hardness, as the fierceness of summer had previously made them
      intolerable.
    
    
      It was believed that some of this unyielding grimness attached to Hays
      himself. Certain it is that neither hardship nor prosperity had touched
      his character. Years ago his emigrant team had broken down in this wild
      but wooded defile of the Sierras, and he had been forced to a winter
      encampment, with only a rude log-cabin for shelter, on the very verge of
      the promised land. Unable to enter it himself, he was nevertheless able to
      assist the better-equipped teams that followed him with wood and water and
      a coarse forage gathered from a sheltered slope of wild oats. This was the
      beginning of a rude "supply station" which afterwards became so profitable
      that when spring came and Hays' team were sufficiently recruited to follow
      the flood of immigrating gold-seekers to the placers and valleys, there
      seemed no occasion for it. His fortune had been already found in the belt
      of arable slope behind the wooded defile, and in the miraculously located
      coign of vantage on what was now the great highway of travel and the only
      oasis and first relief of the weary journey; the breaking down of his own
      team at that spot had not only been the salvation of those who found at
      "Hays" the means of prosecuting the last part of their pilgrimage, but
      later provided the equipment of returning teams.
    
    
      The first two years of this experience had not been without hardship and
      danger. He had been raided by Indians and besieged for three days in his
      stockaded cabin; he had been invested by wintry drifts of twenty feet of
      snow, cut off equally from incoming teams from the pass and the valley
      below. During the second year his wife had joined him with four children,
      but whether the enforced separation had dulled her conjugal affection, or
      whether she was tempted by a natural feminine longing for the land of
      promise beyond, she sought it one morning with a fascinating teamster,
      leaving her two sons and two daughters behind her; two years later the
      elder of the daughters followed the mother's example, with such maidenly
      discretion, however, as to forbear compromising herself by any previous
      matrimonial formality whatever. From that day Hays had no further personal
      intercourse with the valley below. He put up a hotel a mile away from the
      farmhouse that he might not have to dispense hospitality to his customers,
      nor accept their near companionship. Always a severe Presbyterian, and an
      uncompromising deacon of a far-scattered and scanty community who
      occasionally held their service in one of his barns, he grew more rigid,
      sectarian, and narrow day by day. He was feared, and although neither
      respected nor loved, his domination and endurance were accepted. A grim
      landlord, hard creditor, close-fisted patron, and a smileless neighbor who
      neither gambled nor drank, "Old Hays," as he was called, while yet scarce
      fifty, had few acquaintances and fewer friends. There were those who
      believed that his domestic infelicities were the result of his
      unsympathetic nature; it never occurred to any one (but himself probably)
      that they might have been the cause. In those Sierran altitudes, as
      elsewhere, the belief in original sin&mdash;popularly known as "pure
      cussedness"&mdash;dominated and overbore any consideration of passive,
      impelling circumstances or temptation, unless they had been actively
      demonstrated with a revolver. The passive expression of harshness,
      suspicion, distrust, and moroseness was looked upon as inherent
      wickedness.
    
    
      The storm raged violently as Hays emerged from the last of a long range of
      outbuildings and sheds, and crossed the open space between him and the
      farmhouse. Before he had reached the porch, with its scant shelter, he had
      floundered through a snowdrift, and faced the full fury of the storm. But
      the snow seemed to have glanced from his hard angular figure as it had
      from his roof-ridge, for when he entered the narrow hall-way his pilot
      jacket was unmarked, except where a narrow line of powdered flakes
      outlined the seams as if worn. To the right was an apartment, half office,
      half sitting-room, furnished with a dark and chilly iron safe, a sofa and
      chairs covered with black and coldly shining horsehair. Here Hays not only
      removed his upper coat but his under one also, and drawing a chair before
      the fire sat down in his shirt-sleeves. It was his usual rustic pioneer
      habit, and might have been some lingering reminiscence of certain remote
      ancestors to whom clothes were an impediment. He was warming his hands and
      placidly ignoring his gaunt arms in their thinly-clad "hickory" sleeves,
      when a young girl of eighteen sauntered, half perfunctorily, half
      inquisitively into the room. It was his only remaining daughter. Already
      elected by circumstances to a dry household virginity, her somewhat large
      features, sallow complexion, and tasteless, unattractive dress, did not
      obviously suggest a sacrifice. Since her sister's departure she had taken
      sole charge of her father's domestic affairs and the few rude servants he
      employed, with a certain inherited following of his own moods and methods.
      To the neighbors she was known as "Miss Hays,"&mdash;a dubious respect
      that, in a community of familiar "Sallies," "Mamies," "Pussies," was
      grimly prophetic. Yet she rejoiced in the Oriental appellation of
      "Zuleika." To this it is needless to add that it was impossible to
      conceive any one who looked more decidedly Western.
    
    
      "Ye kin put some things in my carpet bag agin the time the sled comes
      round," said her father meditatively, without looking up.
    
    
      "Then you're not coming back tonight?" asked the girl curiously. "What's
      goin' on at the summit, father?"
    
    
      "I am," he said grimly. "You don't reckon I kalkilate to stop thar! I'm
      going on as far as Horseley's to close up that contract afore the weather
      changes."
    
    
      "I kinder allowed it was funny you'd go to the hotel to-night. There's a
      dance there; those two Wetherbee girls and Mamie Harris passed up the road
      an hour ago on a wood-sled, nigh blown to pieces and sittin' up in the
      snow like skeert white rabbits."
    
    
      Hays' brow darkened heavily.
    
    
      "Let 'em go," he said, in a hard voice that the fire did not seem to have
      softened. "Let 'em go for all the good their fool-parents will ever get
      outer them, or the herd of wayside cattle they've let them loose among.
    
    
      "I reckon they haven't much to do at home, or are hard put for company, to
      travel six miles in the snow to show off their prinkin' to a lot of idle
      louts shiny with bear's grease and scented up with doctor's stuff," added
      the girl, shrugging her shoulders, with a touch of her father's mood and
      manner.
    
    
      Perhaps it struck Hays at that moment that her attitude was somewhat
      monstrous and unnatural for one still young and presumably like other
      girls, for, after glancing at her under his heavy brows, he said, in a
      gentler tone:&mdash;
    
    
      "Never YOU mind, Zuly. When your brother Jack comes home he'll know what's
      what, and have all the proper New York ways and style. It's nigh on three
      years now that he's had the best training Dr. Dawson's Academy could give,&mdash;sayin'
      nothing of the pow'ful Christian example of one of the best preachers in
      the States. They mayn't have worldly, ungodly fandangoes where he is, and
      riotous livin', and scarlet abominations, but I've been told that they've
      'tea circles,' and 'assemblies,' and 'harmony concerts' of young folks&mdash;and
      dancin'&mdash;yes, fine square dancin' under control. No, I ain't stinted
      him in anythin'. You kin remember that, Zuleika, when you hear any more
      gossip and backbitin' about your father's meanness. I ain't spared no
      money for him."
    
    
      "I reckon not," said the girl, a little sharply. "Why, there's that draft
      fur two hundred and fifty dollars that kem only last week from the
      Doctor's fur extras."
    
    
      "Yes," replied Hays, with a slight knitting of the brows, "the Doctor mout
      hev writ more particklers, but parsons ain't allus business men. I reckon
      these here extrys were to push Jack along in the term, as the Doctor knew
      I wanted him back here in the spring, now that his brother has got to be
      too stiff-necked and self-opinionated to do his father's work." It seemed
      from this that there had been a quarrel between Hays and his eldest son,
      who conducted his branch business at Sacramento, and who had in a passion
      threatened to set up a rival establishment to his father's. And it was
      also evident from the manner of the girl that she was by no means a strong
      partisan of her father in the quarrel.
    
    
      "You'd better find out first how all the schoolin' and trainin' of Jack's
      is goin' to jibe with the Ranch, and if he ain't been eddicated out of all
      knowledge of station business or keer for it. New York ain't Hays' Ranch,
      and these yer 'assemblies' and 'harmony' doin's and their airs and graces
      may put him out of conceit with our plain ways. I reckon ye didn't take
      that to mind when you've been hustlin' round payin' two hundred and fifty
      dollar drafts for Jack and quo'llin' with Bijah! I ain't sayin' nothin',
      father, only mebbe if Bijah had had drafts and extrys flourished around
      him a little more, mebbe he'd have been more polite and not so rough
      spoken. Mebbe," she continued with a little laugh, "even I'D be a little
      more in the style to suit Master Jack when he comes ef I had three hundred
      dollars' worth of convent schoolin' like Mamie Harris."
    
    
      "Yes, and you'd have only made yourself fair game for ev'ry schemin', lazy
      sport or counter-jumper along the road from this to Sacramento!" responded
      Hays savagely.
    
    
      Zuleika laughed again constrainedly, but in a way that might have
      suggested that this dreadful contingency was still one that it was
      possible to contemplate without entire consternation. As she moved slowly
      towards the door she stopped, with her hand on the lock, and said
      tentatively: "I reckon you won't be wantin' any supper before you go?
      You're almost sure to be offered suthin' up at Horseley's, while if I have
      to cook you up suthin' now and still have the men's regular supper to get
      at seven, it makes all the expense of an extra meal."
    
    
      Hays hesitated. He would have preferred his supper now, and had his
      daughter pressed him would have accepted it. But economy, which was one of
      Zuleika's inherited instincts, vaguely appearing to him to be a virtue,
      interchangeable with chastity and abstemiousness, was certainly to be
      encouraged in a young girl. It hardly seems possible that with an eye
      single to the integrity of the larder she could ever look kindly on the
      blandishments of his sex, or, indeed, be exposed to them. He said simply:
      "Don't cook for me," and resumed his attitude before the fire as the girl
      left the room.
    
    
      As he sat there, grim and immovable as one of the battered fire-dogs
      before him, the wind in the chimney seemed to carry on a deep-throated,
      dejected, and confidential conversation with him, but really had very
      little to reveal. There were no haunting reminiscences of his married life
      in this room, which he had always occupied in preference to the company or
      sitting-room beyond. There were no familiar shadows of the past lurking in
      its corners to pervade his reverie. When he did reflect, which was seldom,
      there was always in his mind a vague idea of a central injustice to which
      he had been subjected, that was to be avoided by circuitous movement, to
      be hidden by work, but never to be surmounted. And to-night he was going
      out in the storm, which he could understand and fight, as he had often
      done before, and he was going to drive a bargain with a man like himself
      and get the better of him if he could, as he had done before, and another
      day would be gone, and that central injustice which he could not
      understand would be circumvented, and he would still be holding his own in
      the world. And the God of Israel whom he believed in, and who was a hard
      but conscientious Providence, something like himself, would assist him
      perhaps some day to the understanding of this same vague injustice which
      He was, for some strange reason, permitting. But never more unrelenting
      and unsparing of others than when under conviction of Sin himself, and
      never more harsh and unforgiving than when fresh from the contemplation of
      the Divine Mercy, he still sat there grimly holding his hand to a warmth
      that never seemed to get nearer his heart than that, when his daughter
      re-entered the room with his carpet-bag.
    
    
      To rise, put on his coat and overcoat, secure a fur cap on his head by a
      woolen comforter, covering his ears and twined round his throat, and to
      rigidly offer a square and weather-beaten cheek to his daughter's dusty
      kiss, did not, apparently, suggest any lingering or hesitation. The sled
      was at the door, which, for a tumultuous moment, opened on the storm and
      the white vision of a horse knee-deep in a drift, and then closed behind
      him. Zuleika shot the bolt, brushed some flakes of the invading snow from
      the mat, and, after frugally raking down the fire on the hearth her father
      had just quitted, retired through the long passage to the kitchen and her
      domestic supervision.
    
    
      It was a few hours later, supper had long past; the "hands" had one by one
      returned to their quarters under the roof or in the adjacent lofts, and
      Zuleika and the two maids had at last abandoned the kitchen for their
      bedrooms beyond. Zuleika herself, by the light of a solitary candle, had
      entered the office and had dropped meditatively into a chair, as she
      slowly raked the warm ashes over the still smouldering fire. The barking
      of dogs had momentarily attracted her attention, but it had suddenly
      ceased. It was followed, however, by a more startling incident,&mdash;a
      slight movement outside, and an attempt to raise the window!
    
    
      She was not frightened; perhaps there was little for her to fear; it was
      known that Hays kept no money in the house, the safe was only used for
      securities and contracts, and there were half a dozen men within call. It
      was, therefore, only her usual active, burning curiosity for novel
      incident that made her run to the window and peer out; but it was with a
      spontaneous cry of astonishment she turned and darted to the front door,
      and opened it to the muffled figure of a young man.
    
    
      "Jack! Saints alive! Why, of all things!" she gasped, incoherently.
    
    
      He stopped her with an impatient gesture and a hand that prevented her
      from closing the door again.
    
    
      "Dad ain't here?" he asked quickly.
    
    
      "No."
    
    
      "When'll he be back?"
    
    
      "Not to-night."
    
    
      "Good," he said, turning to the door again. She could see a motionless
      horse and sleigh in the road, with a woman holding the reins.
    
    
      He beckoned to the woman, who drove to the door and jumped out. Tall,
      handsome, and audacious, she looked at Zuleika with a quick laugh of
      confidence, as at some recognized absurdity.
    
    
      "Go in there," said the young man, opening the door of the office; "I'll
      come back in a minute."
    
    
      As she entered, still smiling, as if taking part in some humorous but
      risky situation, he turned quickly to Zuleika and said in a low voice:
      "Where can we talk?"
    
    
      The girl held out her hand and glided hurriedly through the passage until
      she reached a door, which she opened. By the light of a dying fire he
      could see it was her bedroom. Lighting a candle on the mantel, she looked
      eagerly in his face as he threw aside his muffler and opened his coat. It
      disclosed a spare, youthful figure, and a thin, weak face that a budding
      mustache only seemed to make still more immature. For an instant brother
      and sister gazed at each other. Astonishment on her part, nervous
      impatience on his, apparently repressed any demonstration of family
      affection. Yet when she was about to speak he stopped her roughly.
    
    
      "There now; don't talk. I know what you're goin' to say&mdash;could say it
      myself if I wanted to&mdash;and it's no use. Well then, here I am. You saw
      HER. Well, she's MY WIFE&mdash;we've been married three months. Yes, my
      WIFE; married three months ago. I'm here because I ran away from school&mdash;that
      is, I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE for the last three months. I came out with her
      last steamer; we went up to the Summit Hotel last night&mdash;where they
      didn't know me&mdash;until we could see how the land lay, before popping
      down on dad. I happened to learn that he was out to-night, and I brought
      her down here to have a talk. We can go back again before he comes, you
      know, unless"&mdash;
    
    
      "But," interrupted the girl, with sudden practicality, "you say you ain't
      been at Doctor Dawson's for three months! Why, only last week he drew on
      dad for two hundred and fifty dollars for your extras!"
    
    
      He glanced around him and then arranged his necktie in the glass above the
      mantel with a nervous laugh.
    
    
      "OH, THAT! I fixed that up, and got the money for it in New York to pay
      our passage with. It's all right, you know."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II.
    
    
      The girl stood looking at the ingenious forger with an odd, breathless
      smile. It was difficult to determine, however, if gratified curiosity were
      not its most dominant expression.
    
    
      "And you've got a wife&mdash;and THAT'S her?" she resumed.
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      "Where did you first meet her? Who is she?"
    
    
      "She's an actress&mdash;mighty popular in 'Frisco&mdash;I mean New York.
      Lot o' chaps tried to get her&mdash;I cut 'em out. For all dad's trying to
      keep me at Dawson's&mdash;I ain't such a fool, eh?"
    
    
      Nevertheless, as he stood there stroking his fair mustache, his astuteness
      did not seem to impress his sister to enthusiastic assent. Yet she did not
      relax her breathless, inquisitive smile as she went on:&mdash;
    
    
      "And what are you going to do about dad?"
    
    
      He turned upon her querulously.
    
    
      "Well, that's what I want to talk about."
    
    
      "You'll catch it!" she said impressively. But here her brother's
      nervousness broke out into a weak, impotent fury. It was evident, too,
      that in spite of its apparent spontaneous irritation its intent was
      studied. Catch it! Would he? Oh, yes! Well, she'd see WHO'D catch it! Not
      him. No, he'd had enough of this meanness, and wanted it ended! He wasn't
      a woman to be treated like his sister,&mdash;like their mother&mdash;like
      their brother, if it came to that, for he knew how he was to be brought
      back to take Bijah's place in the spring; he'd heard the whole story. No,
      he was going to stand up for his rights,&mdash;he was going to be treated
      as the son of a man who was worth half a million ought to be treated! He
      wasn't going to be skimped, while his father was wallowing in money that
      he didn't know what to do with,&mdash;money that by rights ought to have
      been given to their mother and their sister. Why, even the law wouldn't
      permit such meanness&mdash;if he was dead. No, he'd come back with Lottie,
      his wife, to show his father that there was one of the family that
      couldn't be fooled and bullied, and wouldn't put up with it any longer.
      There was going to be a fair division of the property, and his sister
      Annie's property, and hers&mdash;Zuleika's&mdash;too, if she'd have the
      pluck to speak up for herself. All this and much more he said. Yet even
      while his small fury was genuine and characteristic, there was such an
      evident incongruity between himself and his speech that it seemed to fit
      him loosely, and in a measure flapped in his gestures like another's
      garment. Zuleika, who had exhibited neither disgust nor sympathy with his
      rebellion, but had rather appeared to enjoy it as a novel domestic
      performance, the morality of which devolved solely upon the performer,
      retained her curious smile. And then a knock at the door startled them.
    
    
      It was the stranger,&mdash;slightly apologetic and still humorous, but
      firm and self-confident withal. She was sorry to interrupt their family
      council, but the fire was going out where she sat, and she would like a
      cup of tea or some refreshment. She did not look at Jack, but, completely
      ignoring him, addressed herself to Zuleika with what seemed to be a direct
      challenge; in that feminine eye-grapple there was a quick, instinctive,
      and final struggle between the two women. The stranger triumphed.
      Zuleika's vacant smile changed to one of submission, and then, equally
      ignoring her brother in this double defeat, she hastened to the kitchen to
      do the visitor's bidding. The woman closed the door behind her, and took
      Zuleika's place before the fire.
    
    
      "Well?" she said, in a half-contemptuous toleration.
    
    
      "Well?" said Jack, in an equally ill-disguised discontent, but an evident
      desire to placate the woman before him. "It's all right, you know. I've
      had my say. It'll come right, Lottie, you'll see."
    
    
      The woman smiled again, and glanced around the bare walls of the room.
    
    
      "And I suppose," she said, drily, "when it comes right I'm to take the
      place of your sister in the charge of this workhouse and succeed to the
      keys of that safe in the other room?"
    
    
      "It'll come all right, I tell you; you can fix things up here any way
      you'll like when we get the old man straight," said Jack, with the
      iteration of feebleness. "And as to that safe, I've seen it chock full of
      securities."
    
    
      "It'll hold one less to-night," she said, looking at the fire.
    
    
      "What are you talking about?" he asked, in querulous suspicion.
    
    
      She drew a paper from her pocket.
    
    
      "It's that draft of yours that you were crazy enough to sign Dawson's name
      to. It was lying out there on the desk. I reckon it isn't a thing you care
      to have kept as evidence, even by your father."
    
    
      She held it in the flames until it was consumed.
    
    
      "By Jove, your head is level, Lottie!" he said, with an admiration that
      was not, however, without a weak reserve of suspicion.
    
    
      "No, it isn't, or I wouldn't be here," she said, curtly. Then she added,
      as if dismissing the subject, "Well, what did you tell her?"
    
    
      "Oh, I said I met you in New York. You see I thought she might think it
      queer if she knew I only met you in San Francisco three weeks ago. Of
      course I said we were married."
    
    
      She looked at him with weary astonishment.
    
    
      "And of course, whether things go right or not, she'll find out that I've
      got a husband living, that I never met you in New York, but on the
      steamer, and that you've lied. I don't see the USE of it. You said you
      were going to tell the whole thing squarely and say the truth, and that's
      why I came to help you."
    
    
      "Yes; but don't you see, hang it all!" he stammered, in the irritation of
      weak confusion, "I had to tell her SOMETHING. Father won't dare to tell
      her the truth, no more than he will the neighbors. He'll hush it up, you
      bet; and when we get this thing fixed you'll go and get your divorce, you
      know, and we'll be married privately on the square."
    
    
      He looked so vague, so immature, yet so fatuously self-confident, that the
      woman extended her hand with a laugh and tapped him on the back as she
      might have patted a dog. Then she disappeared to follow Zuleika in the
      kitchen.
    
    
      When the two women returned together they were evidently on the best of
      terms. So much so that the man, with the easy reaction of a shallow
      nature, became sanguine and exalted, even to an ostentatious exhibition of
      those New York graces on which the paternal Hays had set such store. He
      complacently explained the methods by which he had deceived Dr. Dawson;
      how he had himself written a letter from his father commanding him to
      return to take his brother's place, and how he had shown it to the Doctor
      and been three months in San Francisco looking for work and assisting
      Lottie at the theatre, until a conviction of the righteousness of his
      cause, perhaps combined with the fact that they were also short of money
      and she had no engagement, impelled him to his present heroic step. All of
      which Zuleika listened to with childish interest, but superior
      appreciation of his companion. The fact that this woman was an actress, an
      abomination vaguely alluded to by her father as being even more
      mysteriously wicked than her sister and mother, and correspondingly
      exciting, as offering a possible permanent relief to the monotony of her
      home life, seemed to excuse her brother's weakness. She was almost ready
      to become his partisan&mdash;AFTER she had seen her father.
    
    
      They had talked largely of their plans; they had settled small details of
      the future and the arrangement of the property; they had agreed that
      Zuleika should be relieved of her household drudgery, and sent to a
      fashionable school in San Francisco with a music teacher and a dressmaker.
      They had discussed everything but the precise manner in which the
      revelation should be conveyed to Hays. There was still plenty of time for
      that, for he would not return until to-morrow at noon, and it was already
      tacitly understood that the vehicle of transmission should be a letter
      from the Summit Hotel. The possible contingency of a sudden outburst of
      human passion not entirely controlled by religious feeling was to be
      guarded against.
    
    
      They were sitting comfortably before the replenished fire; the wind was
      still moaning in the chimney, when, suddenly, in a lull of the storm the
      sound of sleigh-bells seemed to fill the room. It was followed by a voice
      from without, and, with a hysterical cry, Zuleika started to her feet. The
      same breathless smile with which she had greeted her brother an hour ago
      was upon her lips as she gasped:&mdash;
    
    
      "Lord, save us!&mdash;but it's dad come back!"
    
    
      I grieve to say that here the doughty redresser of domestic wrongs and
      retriever of the family honor lapsed white-faced in his chair idealess and
      tremulous. It was his frailer companion who rose to the occasion and even
      partly dragged him with her. "Go back to the hotel," she said quickly,
      "and take the sled with you,&mdash;you are not fit to face him now! But he
      does not know ME, and I will stay!" To the staring Zuleika: "I am a
      stranger stopped by a broken sleigh on my way to the hotel. Leave the rest
      to me. Now clear out, both of you. I'll let him in."
    
    
      She looked so confident, self-contained, and superior, that the thought of
      opposition never entered their minds, and as an impatient rapping rose
      from the door they let her, with a half-impatient, half-laughing gesture,
      drive them before her from the room. When they had disappeared in the
      distance, she turned to the front door, unbolted and opened it. Hays
      blundered in out of the snow with a muttered exclamation, and then, as the
      light from the open office door revealed a stranger, started and fell
      back.
    
    
      "Miss Hays is busy," said the woman quietly, "I am afraid, on my account.
      But my sleigh broke down on the way to the hotel and I was forced to get
      out here. I suppose this is Mr. Hays?"
    
    
      A strange woman&mdash;by her dress and appearance a very worldling&mdash;and
      even braver in looks and apparel than many he had seen in the cities&mdash;seemed,
      in spite of all his precautions, to have fallen short of the hotel and
      been precipitated upon him! Yet under the influence of some odd
      abstraction he was affected by it less than he could have believed. He
      even achieved a rude bow as he bolted the door and ushered her into the
      office. More than that, he found himself explaining to the fair trespasser
      the reasons of his return to his own home. For, like a direct man, he had
      a consciousness of some inconsistency in his return&mdash;or in the
      circumstances that induced a change of plans which might conscientiously
      require an explanation.
    
    
      "You see, ma'am, a rather singular thing happened to me after I passed the
      summit. Three times I lost the track, got off it somehow, and found myself
      traveling in a circle. The third time, when I struck my own tracks again,
      I concluded I'd just follow them back here. I suppose I might have got the
      road again by tryin' and fightin' the snow&mdash;but ther's some things
      not worth the fightin'. This was a matter of business, and, after all,
      ma'am, business ain't everythin', is it?"
    
    
      He was evidently in some unusual mood, the mood that with certain reticent
      natures often compels them to make their brief confidences to utter
      strangers rather than impart them to those intimate friends who might
      remind them of their weakness. She agreed with him pleasantly, but not so
      obviously as to excite suspicion. "And you preferred to let your business
      go, and come back to the comfort of your own home and family."
    
    
      "The comfort of my home and family?" he repeated in a dry, deliberate
      voice. "Well, I reckon I ain't been tempted much by THAT. That isn't what
      I meant." But he went back to the phrase, repeating it grimly, as if it
      were some mandatory text. "The comfort of my OWN HOME AND FAMILY! Well,
      Satan hasn't set THAT trap for my feet yet, ma'am. No; ye saw my daughter?
      well, that's all my family; ye see this room? that's all my home. My wife
      ran away from me; my daughter cleared out too, my eldest son as was with
      me here has quo'lled with me and reckons to set up a rival business agin
      me. No," he said, still more meditatively and deliberately; "it wasn't to
      come back to the comforts of my own home and family that I faced round on
      Heavy Tree Hill, I reckon."
    
    
      As the woman, for certain reasons, had no desire to check this auspicious
      and unlooked for confidence, she waited patiently. Hays remained silent
      for an instant, warming his hands before the fire, and then looked up
      interrogatively.
    
    
      "A professor of religion, ma'am, or under conviction?"
    
    
      "Not exactly," said the lady smiling.
    
    
      "Excuse me, but in spite of your fine clothes I reckoned you had a serious
      look just now. A reader of Scripture, may be?"
    
    
      "I know the Bible."
    
    
      "You remember when the angel with the flamin' sword appeared unto Saul on
      the road to Damascus?"
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      "It mout hev been suthin' in that style that stopped me," he said slowly
      and tentatively. "Though nat'rally I didn't SEE anything, and only had the
      queer feelin'. It might hev been THAT shied my mare off the track."
    
    
      "But Saul was up to some wickedness, wasn't he?" said the lady smilingly,
      "while YOU were simply going somewhere on business?"
    
    
      "Yes," said Hays thoughtfully, "but my BUSINESS might hev seemed like
      persecution. I don't mind tellin' you what it was if you'd care to listen.
      But mebbe you're tired. Mebbe you want to retire. You know," he went on
      with a sudden hospitable outburst, "you needn't be in any hurry to go; we
      kin take care of you here to-night, and it'll cost you nothin'. And I'll
      send you on with my sleigh in the mornin'. Per'aps you'd like suthin' to
      eat&mdash;a cup of tea&mdash;or&mdash;I'll call Zuleika;" and he rose with
      an expression of awkward courtesy.
    
    
      But the lady, albeit with a self-satisfied sparkle in her dark eyes, here
      carelessly assured him that Zuleika had already given her refreshment,
      and, indeed, was at that moment preparing her own room for her. She begged
      he would not interrupt his interesting story.
    
    
      Hays looked relieved.
    
    
      "Well, I reckon I won't call her, for what I was goin' to say ain't
      exackly the sort o' thin' for an innocent, simple sort o' thing like her
      to hear&mdash;I mean," he interrupted himself hastily&mdash;"that folks of
      more experience of the world like you and me don't mind speakin' of&mdash;I'm
      sorter takin' it for granted that you're a married woman, ma'am."
    
    
      The lady, who had regarded him with a sudden rigidity, here relaxed her
      expression and nodded.
    
    
      "Well," continued Hays, resuming his place by the fire, "you see this yer
      man I was goin' to see lives about four miles beyond the summit on a ranch
      that furnishes most of the hay for the stock that side of the Divide. He's
      bin holdin' off his next year's contracts with me, hopin' to make better
      terms from the prospects of a late spring and higher prices. He held his
      head mighty high and talked big of waitin' his own time. I happened to
      know he couldn't do it."
    
    
      He put his hands on his knees and stared at the fire, and then went on:&mdash;
    
    
      "Ye see this man had had crosses and family trials. He had a wife that
      left him to jine a lot of bally dancers and painted women in the 'Frisco
      playhouses when he was livin' in the southern country. You'll say that was
      like MY own case,&mdash;and mebbe that was why it came to him to tell me
      about it,&mdash;but the difference betwixt HIM and ME was that instead of
      restin' unto the Lord and findin' Him, and pluckin' out the eye that
      offended him 'cordin' to Scripter, as I did, HE followed after HER tryin'
      to get her back, until, findin' that wasn't no use, he took a big disgust
      and came up here to hide hisself, where there wasn't no playhouse nor
      play-actors, and no wimmen but Injin squaws. He pre-empted the land, and
      nat'rally, there bein' no one ez cared to live there but himself, he had
      it all his own way, made it pay, and, as I was sayin' before, held his
      head high for prices. Well&mdash;you ain't gettin' tired, ma'am?"
    
    
      "No," said the lady, resting her cheek on her hand and gazing on the fire,
      "it's all very interesting; and so odd that you two men, with nearly the
      same experiences, should be neighbors."
    
    
      "Say buyer and seller, ma'am, not neighbors&mdash;at least Scriptoorily&mdash;nor
      friends. Well,&mdash;now this is where the Speshal Providence comes in,&mdash;only
      this afternoon Jim Briggs, hearin' me speak of Horseley's offishness"&mdash;
    
    
      "WHOSE offishness?" asked the lady.
    
    
      "Horseley's offishness,&mdash;Horseley's the name of the man I'm talkin'
      about. Well, hearin' that, he says: 'You hold on, Hays, and he'll climb
      down. That wife of his has left the stage&mdash;got sick of it&mdash;and
      is driftin' round in 'Frisco with some fellow. When Horseley gets to hear
      that, you can't keep him here,&mdash;he'll settle up, sell out, and
      realize on everything he's got to go after her agin,&mdash;you bet.'
      That's what Briggs said. Well, that's what sent me up to Horseley's
      to-night&mdash;to get there, drop the news, and then pin him down to that
      contract."
    
    
      "It looked like a good stroke of business and a fair one," said the lady
      in an odd voice. It was so odd that Hays looked up. But she had somewhat
      altered her position, and was gazing at the ceiling, and with her hand to
      her face seemed to have just recovered from a slight yawn, at which he
      hesitated with a new and timid sense of politeness.
    
    
      "You're gettin' tired, ma'am?"
    
    
      "Oh dear, no!" she said in the same voice, but clearing her throat with a
      little cough. "And why didn't you see this Mr. Horseley after all? Oh, I
      forgot!&mdash;you said you changed your mind from something you'd heard."
    
    
      He had turned his eyes to the fire again, but without noticing as he did
      so that she slowly moved her face, still half hidden by her hand, towards
      him and was watching him intently.
    
    
      "No," he said, slowly, "nothin' I heard, somethin' I felt. It mout hev
      been that that set me off the track. It kem to me all of a sudden that he
      might be sittin' thar calm and peaceful like ez I might be here, hevin'
      forgot all about her and his trouble, and here was me goin' to drop down
      upon him and start it all fresh agin. It looked a little like persecution&mdash;yes,
      like persecution. I got rid of it, sayin' to myself it was business. But
      I'd got off the road meantime, and had to find it again, and whenever I
      got back to the track and was pointed for his house, it all seemed to come
      back on me and set me off agin. When that had happened three times, I
      turned round and started for home."
    
    
      "And do you mean to say," said the lady, with a discordant laugh, "that
      you believe, because YOU didn't go there and break the news, that nobody
      else will? That he won't hear of it from the first man he meets?"
    
    
      "He don't meet any one up where he lives, and only Briggs and myself know
      it, and I'll see that Briggs don't tell. But it was mighty queer this
      whole thing comin' upon me suddenly,&mdash;wasn't it?"
    
    
      "Very queer," replied the lady; "for"&mdash;with the same metallic laugh&mdash;"you
      don't seem to be given to this kind of weakness with your own family."
    
    
      If there was any doubt as to the sarcastic suggestion of her voice, there
      certainly could be none in the wicked glitter of her eyes fixed upon his
      face under her shading hand. But haply he seemed unconscious of both, and
      even accepted her statement without an ulterior significance.
    
    
      "Yes," he said, communingly, to the glaring embers of the hearth, "it must
      have been a special revelation."
    
    
      There was something so fatuous and one-idea'd in his attitude and
      expression, so monstrously inconsistent and inadequate to what was going
      on around him, and so hopelessly stupid&mdash;if a mere simulation&mdash;that
      the angry suspicion that he was acting a part slowly faded from her eyes,
      and a hysterical smile began to twitch her set lips. She still gazed at
      him. The wind howled drearily in the chimney; all that was economic, grim,
      and cheerless in the room seemed to gather as flitting shadows around that
      central figure. Suddenly she arose with such a quick rustling of her
      skirts that he lifted his eyes with a start; for she was standing
      immediately before him, her hands behind her, her handsome, audacious face
      bent smilingly forward, and her bold, brilliant eyes within a foot of his
      own.
    
    
      "Now, Mr. Hays, do you want to know what this warning or special
      revelation of yours REALLY meant? Well, it had nothing whatever to do with
      that man on the summit. No. The whole interest, gist, and meaning of it
      was simply this, that you should turn round and come straight back here
      and"&mdash;she drew back and made him an exaggerated theatrical curtsey&mdash;"have
      the supreme pleasure of making MY acquaintance! That was all. And now, as
      you've HAD IT, in five minutes I must be off. You've offered me already
      your horse and sleigh to go to the summit. I accept it and go! Good-by!"
    
    
      He knew nothing of a woman's coquettish humor; he knew still less of that
      mimic stage from which her present voice, gesture, and expression were
      borrowed; he had no knowledge of the burlesque emotions which that voice,
      gesture, and expression were supposed to portray, and finally and fatally
      he was unable to detect the feminine hysteric jar and discord that
      underlay it all. He thought it was strong, characteristic, and real, and
      accepted it literally. He rose.
    
    
      "Ef you allow you can't stay, why I'll go and get the horse. I reckon he
      ain't bin put up yet."
    
    
      "Do, please."
    
    
      He grimly resumed his coat and hat and disappeared through the passage
      into the kitchen, whence, a moment later, Zuleika came flying.
    
    
      "Well, what has happened?" she said eagerly.
    
    
      "It's all right," said the woman quickly, "though he knows nothing yet.
      But I've got things fixed generally, so that he'll be quite ready to have
      it broken to him by this time to-morrow. But don't you say anything till
      I've seen Jack and you hear from HIM. Remember."
    
    
      She spoke rapidly; her cheeks were quite glowing from some sudden energy;
      so were Zuleika's with the excitement of curiosity. Presently the sound of
      sleigh-bells again filled the room. It was Hays leading the horse and
      sleigh to the door, beneath a sky now starlit and crisp under a northeast
      wind. The fair stranger cast a significant glance at Zuleika, and
      whispered hurriedly, "You know he must not come with me. You must keep him
      here."
    
    
      She ran to the door muffled and hooded, leaped into the sleigh, and
      gathered up the reins.
    
    
      "But you cannot go alone," said Hays, with awkward courtesy. "I was
      kalkilatin'"&mdash;
    
    
      "You're too tired to go out again, dad," broke in Zuleika's voice quickly.
      "You ain't fit; you're all gray and krinkly now, like as when you had one
      of your last spells. She'll send the sleigh back to-morrow."
    
    
      "I can find my way," said the lady briskly; "there's only one turn off, I
      believe, and that"&mdash;
    
    
      "Leads to the stage station three miles west. You needn't be afraid of
      gettin' off on that, for you'll likely see the down stage crossin' your
      road ez soon ez you get clear of the ranch."
    
    
      "Good-night," said the lady. An arc of white spray sprang before the
      forward runner, and the sleigh vanished in the road.
    
    
      Father and daughter returned to the office.
    
    
      "You didn't get to know her, dad, did ye?" queried Zuleika.
    
    
      "No," responded Hays gravely, "except to see she wasn't no backwoods or
      mountaineering sort. Now, there's the kind of woman, Zuly, as knows her
      own mind and yours too; that a man like your brother Jack oughter pick out
      when he marries."
    
    
      Zuleika's face beamed behind her father. "You ain't goin' to sit up any
      longer, dad?" she said, as she noticed him resume his seat by the fire.
      "It's gettin' late, and you look mighty tuckered out with your night's
      work."
    
    
      "Do you know what she said, Zuly?" returned her father, after a pause,
      which turned out to have been a long, silent laugh.
    
    
      "No."
    
    
      "She said," he repeated slowly, "that she reckoned I came back here
      to-night to have the pleasure of her acquaintance!" He brought his two
      hands heavily down upon his knees, rubbing them down deliberately towards
      his ankles, and leaning forward with his face to the fire and a
      long-sustained smile of complete though tardy appreciation.
    
    
      He was still in this attitude when Zuleika left him. The wind crooned over
      him confidentially, but he still sat there, given up apparently to some
      posthumous enjoyment of his visitor's departing witticism.
    
    
      It was scarcely daylight when Zuleika, while dressing, heard a quick
      tapping upon her shutter. She opened it to the scared and bewildered face
      of her brother.
    
    
      "What happened with her and father last night?" he said hoarsely.
    
    
      "Nothing&mdash;why?"
    
    
      "Read that. It was brought to me half an hour ago by a man in dad's
      sleigh, from the stage station."
    
    
      He handed her a crumpled note with trembling fingers. She took it and
      read:&mdash;
    
    
      "The game's up and I'm out of it! Take my advice and clear out of it too,
      until you can come back in better shape. Don't be such a fool as to try
      and follow me. Your father isn't one, and that's where you've slipped up."
    
    
      "He shall pay for it, whatever he's done," said her brother with an access
      of wild passion. "Where is he?"
    
    
      "Why, Jack, you wouldn't dare to see him now?"
    
    
      "Wouldn't I?" He turned and ran, convulsed with passion, before the
      windows towards the front of the house. Zuleika slipped out of her bedroom
      and ran to her father's room. He was not there. Already she could hear her
      brother hammering frantically against the locked front door.
    
    
      The door of the office was partly open. Her father was still there.
      Asleep? Yes, for he had apparently sunk forward before the cold hearth.
      But the hands that he had always been trying to warm were colder than the
      hearth or ashes, and he himself never again spoke nor stirred.
    
    
    
      It was deemed providential by the neighbors that his youngest and favorite
      son, alarmed by news of his father's failing health, had arrived from the
      Atlantic States just at the last moment. But it was thought singular that
      after the division of the property he entirely abandoned the Ranch, and
      that even pending the division his beautiful but fastidious Eastern bride
      declined to visit it with her husband.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      JOHNSON'S "OLD WOMAN."
    
    
      It was growing dark, and the Sonora trail was becoming more indistinct
      before me at every step. The difficulty had increased over the grassy
      slope, where the overflow from some smaller watercourse above had worn a
      number of diverging gullies so like the trail as to be undistinguishable
      from it. Unable to determine which was the right one, I threw the reins
      over the mule's neck and resolved to trust to that superior animal's
      sagacity, of which I had heard so much. But I had not taken into account
      the equally well-known weaknesses of sex and species, and Chu Chu had
      already shown uncontrollable signs of wanting her own way. Without a
      moment's hesitation, feeling the relaxed bridle, she lay down and rolled
      over.
    
    
      In this perplexity the sound of horse's hoofs ringing out of the rocky
      canyon beyond was a relief, even if momentarily embarrassing. An instant
      afterwards a horse and rider appeared cantering round the hill on what was
      evidently the lost trail, and pulled up as I succeeded in forcing Chu Chu
      to her legs again.
    
    
      "Is that the trail from Sonora?" I asked.
    
    
      "Yes;" but with a critical glance at the mule, "I reckon you ain't going
      thar tonight."
    
    
      "Why not?"
    
    
      "It's a matter of eighteen miles, and most of it a blind trail through the
      woods after you take the valley."
    
    
      "Is it worse than this?"
    
    
      "What's the matter with this trail? Ye ain't expecting a racecourse or a
      shell road over the foothills&mdash;are ye?"
    
    
      "No. Is there any hotel where I can stop?"
    
    
      "Nary."
    
    
      "Nor any house?"
    
    
      "No."
    
    
      "Thank you. Good-night."
    
    
      He had already passed on, when he halted again and turned in his saddle.
      "Look yer. Just a spell over yon canyon ye'll find a patch o' buckeyes;
      turn to the right and ye'll see a trail. That'll take ye to a shanty. You
      ask if it's Johnson's."
    
    
      "Who's Johnson?"
    
    
      "I am. You ain't lookin' for Vanderbilt or God Almighty up here, are you?
      Well, then, you hark to me, will you? You say to my old woman to give you
      supper and a shakedown somewhar to-night. Say I sent you. So long."
    
    
      He was gone before I could accept or decline. An extraordinary noise
      proceeded from Chu Chu, not unlike a suppressed chuckle. I looked sharply
      at her; she coughed affectedly, and, with her head and neck stretched to
      their greatest length, appeared to contemplate her neat little off fore
      shoe with admiring abstraction. But as soon as I had mounted she set off
      abruptly, crossed the rocky canyon, apparently sighted the patch of
      buckeyes of her own volition, and without the slightest hesitation found
      the trail to the right, and in half an hour stood before the shanty.
    
    
      It was a log cabin with an additional "lean-to" of the same material,
      roofed with bark, and on the other side a larger and more ambitious
      "extension" built of rough, unplaned, and unpainted redwood boards,
      lightly shingled. The "lean-to" was evidently used as a kitchen, and the
      central cabin as a living-room. The barking of a dog as I approached
      called four children of different sizes to the open door, where already an
      enterprising baby was feebly essaying to crawl over a bar of wood laid
      across the threshold to restrain it.
    
    
      "Is this Johnson's house?"
    
    
      My remark was really addressed to the eldest, a boy of apparently nine or
      ten, but I felt that my attention was unduly fascinated by the baby, who
      at that moment had toppled over the bar, and was calmly eyeing me upside
      down, while silently and heroically suffocating in its petticoats. The boy
      disappeared without replying, but presently returned with a taller girl of
      fourteen or fifteen. I was struck with the way that, as she reached the
      door, she passed her hands rapidly over the heads of the others as if
      counting them, picked up the baby, reversed it, shook out its clothes, and
      returned it to the inside, without even looking at it. The act was
      evidently automatic and habitual.
    
    
      I repeated my question timidly.
    
    
      Yes, it WAS Johnson's, but he had just gone to King's Mills. I replied,
      hurriedly, that I knew it,&mdash;that I had met him beyond the canyon. As
      I had lost my way and couldn't get to Sonora to-night, he had been good
      enough to say that I might stay there until morning. My voice was slightly
      raised for the benefit of Mr. Johnson's "old woman," who, I had no doubt,
      was inspecting me furtively from some corner.
    
    
      The girl drew the children away, except the boy. To him she said simply,
      "Show the stranger whar to stake out his mule, 'Dolphus," and disappeared
      in the "extension" without another word. I followed my little guide, who
      was perhaps more actively curious, but equally unresponsive. To my various
      questions he simply returned a smile of exasperating vacuity. But he never
      took his eager eyes from me, and I was satisfied that not a detail of my
      appearance escaped him. Leading the way behind the house to a little wood,
      whose only "clearing" had been effected by decay or storm, he stood
      silently apart while I picketed Chu Chu, neither offering to assist me nor
      opposing any interruption to my survey of the locality. There was no trace
      of human cultivation in the surroundings of the cabin; the wilderness
      still trod sharply on the heels of the pioneer's fresh footprints, and
      even seemed to obliterate them. For a few yards around the actual dwelling
      there was an unsavory fringe of civilization in the shape of cast-off
      clothes, empty bottles, and tin cans, and the adjacent thorn and elder
      bushes blossomed unwholesomely with bits of torn white paper and bleaching
      dish-cloths. This hideous circle never widened; Nature always appeared to
      roll back the intruding debris; no bird nor beast carried it away; no
      animal ever forced the uncleanly barrier; civilization remained grimly
      trenched in its own exuvia. The old terrifying girdle of fire around the
      hunter's camp was not more deterring to curious night prowlers than this
      coarse and accidental outwork.
    
    
      When I regained the cabin I found it empty, the doors of the lean-to and
      extension closed, but there was a stool set before a rude table, upon
      which smoked a tin cup of coffee, a tin dish of hot saleratus biscuit, and
      a plate of fried beef. There was something odd and depressing in this
      silent exclusion of my presence. Had Johnson's "old woman" from some dark
      post of observation taken a dislike to my appearance, or was this churlish
      withdrawal a peculiarity of Sierran hospitality? Or was Mrs. Johnson young
      and pretty, and hidden under the restricting ban of Johnson's jealousy, or
      was she a deformed cripple, or even a bedridden crone? From the extension
      at times came a murmur of voices, but never the accents of adult
      womanhood. The gathering darkness, relieved only by a dull glow from the
      smouldering logs in the adobe chimney, added to my loneliness. In the
      circumstances I knew I ought to have put aside the repast and given myself
      up to gloomy and pessimistic reflection; but Nature is often inconsistent,
      and in that keen mountain air, I grieve to say, my physical and moral
      condition was not in that perfect accord always indicated by romancers. I
      had an appetite and I gratified it; dyspepsia and ethical reflections
      might come later. I ate the saleratus biscuit cheerfully, and was
      meditatively finishing my coffee when a gurgling sound from the rafters
      above attracted my attention. I looked up; under the overhang of the bark
      roof three pairs of round eyes were fixed upon me. They belonged to the
      children I had previously seen, who, in the attitude of Raphael's cherubs,
      had evidently been deeply interested spectators of my repast. As our eyes
      met an inarticulate giggle escaped the lips of the youngest.
    
    
      I never could understand why the shy amusement of children over their
      elders is not accepted as philosophically by its object as when it
      proceeds from an equal. We fondly believe that when Jones or Brown laughs
      at us it is from malice, ignorance, or a desire to show his superiority,
      but there is always a haunting suspicion in our minds that these little
      critics REALLY see something in us to laugh at. I, however, smiled affably
      in return, ignoring any possible grotesqueness in my manner of eating in
      private.
    
    
      "Come here, Johnny," I said blandly.
    
    
      The two elder ones, a girl and a boy, disappeared instantly, as if the
      crowning joke of this remark was too much for them. From a scraping and
      kicking against the log wall I judged that they had quickly dropped to the
      ground outside. The younger one, the giggler, remained fascinated, but
      ready to fly at a moment's warning.
    
    
      "Come here, Johnny, boy," I repeated gently. "I want you to go to your
      mother, please, and tell her"&mdash;
    
    
      But here the child, who had been working its face convulsively, suddenly
      uttered a lugubrious howl and disappeared also. I ran to the front door
      and looked out in time to see the tallest girl, who had received me,
      walking away with it under her arm, pushing the boy ahead of her and
      looking back over her shoulder, not unlike a youthful she-bear conducting
      her cubs from danger. She disappeared at the end of the extension, where
      there was evidently another door.
    
    
      It was very extraordinary. It was not strange that I turned back to the
      cabin with a chagrin and mortification which for a moment made me
      entertain the wild idea of saddling Chu Chu, and shaking the dust of that
      taciturn house from my feet. But the ridiculousness of such an act, to say
      nothing of its ingratitude, as quickly presented itself to me. Johnson had
      offered me only food and shelter; I could have claimed no more from the
      inn I had asked him to direct me to. I did not re-enter the house, but,
      lighting my last cigar, began to walk gloomily up and down the trail. With
      the outcoming of the stars it had grown lighter; through a wind opening in
      the trees I could see the heavy bulk of the opposite mountain, and beyond
      it a superior crest defined by a red line of forest fire, which, however,
      cast no reflection on the surrounding earth or sky. Faint woodland
      currents of air, still warm from the afternoon sun, stirred the leaves
      around me with long-drawn aromatic breaths. But these in time gave way to
      the steady Sierran night wind sweeping down from the higher summits, and
      rocking the tops of the tallest pines, yet leaving the tranquillity of the
      dark lower aisles unshaken. It was very quiet; there was no cry nor call
      of beast or bird in the darkness; the long rustle of the tree-tops sounded
      as faint as the far-off wash of distant seas. Nor did the resemblance
      cease there; the close-set files of the pines and cedars, stretching in
      illimitable ranks to the horizon, were filled with the immeasurable
      loneliness of an ocean shore. In this vast silence I began to think I
      understood the taciturnity of the dwellers in the solitary cabin.
    
    
      When I returned, however, I was surprised to find the tallest girl
      standing by the door. As I approached she retreated before me, and
      pointing to the corner where a common cot bed had been evidently just put
      up, said, "Ye can turn in thar, only ye'll have to rouse out early when
      'Dolphus does the chores," and was turning towards the extension again,
      when I stopped her almost appealingly.
    
    
      "One moment, please. Can I see your mother?"
    
    
      She stopped and looked at me with a singular expression. Then she said
      sharply:&mdash;
    
    
      "You know, fust rate, she's dead."
    
    
      She was turning away again, but I think she must have seen my concern in
      my face, for she hesitated. "But," I said quickly, "I certainly understood
      your father, that is, Mr. Johnson," I added, interrogatively, "to say that&mdash;that
      I was to speak to"&mdash;I didn't like to repeat the exact phrase&mdash;"his
      WIFE."
    
    
      "I don't know what he was playin' ye for," she said shortly. "Mar has been
      dead mor'n a year."
    
    
      "But," I persisted, "is there no grown-up woman here?"
    
    
      "No."
    
    
      "Then who takes care of you and the children?"
    
    
      "I do."
    
    
      "Yourself and your father&mdash;eh?"
    
    
      "Dad ain't here two days running, and then on'y to sleep."
    
    
      "And you take the entire charge of the house?"
    
    
      "Yes, and the log tallies."
    
    
      "The log tallies?"
    
    
      "Yes; keep count and measure the logs that go by the slide."
    
    
      It flashed upon me that I had passed the slide or declivity on the
      hillside, where logs were slipped down into the valley, and I inferred
      that Johnson's business was cutting timber for the mill.
    
    
      "But you're rather young for all this work," I suggested.
    
    
      "I'm goin' on sixteen," she said gravely.
    
    
      Indeed, for the matter of that, she might have been any age. Her face, on
      which sunburn took the place of complexion, was already hard and set. But
      on a nearer view I was struck with the fact that her eyes, which were not
      large, were almost indistinguishable from the presence of the most
      singular eyelashes I had ever seen. Intensely black, intensely thick, and
      even tangled in their profusion, they bristled rather than fringed her
      eyelids, obliterating everything but the shining black pupils beneath,
      which were like certain lustrous hairy mountain berries. It was this
      woodland suggestion that seemed to uncannily connect her with the
      locality. I went on playfully:&mdash;
    
    
      "That's not VERY old&mdash;but tell me&mdash;does your father, or DID your
      father, ever speak of you as his 'old woman?'"
    
    
      She nodded. "Then you thought I was mar?" she said, smiling.
    
    
      It was such a relief to see her worn face relax its expression of pathetic
      gravity&mdash;although this operation quite buried her eyes in their black
      thickest hedge again&mdash;that I continued cheerfully: "It wasn't much of
      a mistake, considering all you do for the house and family."
    
    
      "Then you didn't tell Billy 'to go and be dead in the ground with mar,' as
      he 'lows you did?" she said half suspiciously, yet trembling on the edge
      of a smile.
    
    
      No, I had not, but I admitted that my asking him to go to his mother might
      have been open to this dismal construction by a sensitive infant mind. She
      seemed mollified, and again turned to go.
    
    
      "Good-night, Miss&mdash;you know your father didn't tell me your real
      name," I said.
    
    
      "Karline!"
    
    
      "Good-night, Miss Karline."
    
    
      I held out my hand.
    
    
      She looked at it and then at me through her intricate eyelashes. Then she
      struck it aside briskly, but not unkindly, said "Quit foolin', now," as
      she might have said to one of the children, and disappeared through the
      inner door. Not knowing whether to be amused or indignant, I remained
      silent a moment. Then I took a turn outside in the increasing darkness,
      listened to the now hurrying wind over the tree-tops, re-entered the
      cabin, closed the door, and went to bed.
    
    
      But not to sleep. Perhaps the responsibility towards these solitary
      children, which Johnson had so lightly shaken off, devolved upon me as I
      lay there, for I found myself imagining a dozen emergencies of their
      unprotected state, with which the elder girl could scarcely grapple. There
      was little to fear from depredatory man or beast&mdash;desperadoes of the
      mountain trail never stooped to ignoble burglary, bear or panther seldom
      approached a cabin&mdash;but there was the chance of sudden illness, fire,
      the accidents that beset childhood, to say nothing of the narrowing moral
      and mental effect of their isolation at that tender age. It was scandalous
      in Johnson to leave them alone.
    
    
      In the silence I found I could hear quite distinctly the sound of their
      voices in the extension, and it was evident that Caroline was putting them
      to bed. Suddenly a voice was uplifted&mdash;her own! She began to sing and
      the others to join her. It was the repetition of a single verse of a
      well-known lugubrious negro melody. "All the world am sad and dreary,"
      wailed Caroline, in a high head-note, "everywhere I roam." "Oh, darkieth,"
      lisped the younger girl in response, "how my heart growth weary, far from
      the old folkth at h-o-o-me." This was repeated two or three times before
      the others seemed to get the full swing of it, and then the lines rose and
      fell sadly and monotonously in the darkness. I don't know why, but I at
      once got the impression that those motherless little creatures were under
      a vague belief that their performance was devotional, and was really
      filling the place of an evening hymn. A brief and indistinct kind of
      recitation, followed by a dead silence, broken only by the slow creaking
      of new timber, as if the house were stretching itself to sleep too,
      confirmed my impression. Then all became quiet again.
    
    
      But I was more wide awake than before. Finally I rose, dressed myself, and
      dragging my stool to the fire, took a book from my knapsack, and by the
      light of a guttering candle, which I discovered in a bottle in the corner
      of the hearth, began to read. Presently I fell into a doze. How long I
      slept I could not tell, for it seemed to me that a dreamy consciousness of
      a dog barking at last forced itself upon me so strongly that I awoke. The
      barking appeared to come from behind the cabin in the direction of the
      clearing where I had tethered Chu Chu. I opened the door hurriedly, ran
      round the cabin towards the hollow, and was almost at once met by the bulk
      of the frightened Chu Chu, plunging out of the darkness towards me, kept
      only in check by her reata in the hand of a blanketed shape slowly
      advancing with a gun over its shoulder out of the hollow. Before I had
      time to recover from my astonishment I was thrown into greater confusion
      by recognizing the shape as none other than Caroline!
    
    
      Without the least embarrassment or even self-consciousness of her
      appearance, she tossed the end of the reata to me with the curtest
      explanation as she passed by. Some prowling bear or catamount had
      frightened the mule. I had better tether it before the cabin away from the
      wind.
    
    
      "But I thought wild beasts never came so near," I said quickly.
    
    
      "Mule meat's mighty temptin'," said the girl sententiously and passed on.
      I wanted to thank her; I wanted to say how sorry I was that she had been
      disturbed; I wanted to compliment her on her quiet midnight courage, and
      yet warn her against recklessness; I wanted to know whether she had been
      accustomed to such alarms; and if the gun she carried was really a
      necessity. But I could only respect her reticence, and I was turning away
      when I was struck by a more inexplicable spectacle. As she neared the end
      of the extension I distinctly saw the tall figure of a man, moving with a
      certain diffidence and hesitation that did not, however, suggest any
      intention of concealment, among the trees; the girl apparently saw him at
      the same moment and slightly slackened her pace. Not more than a dozen
      feet separated them. He said something that was inaudible to my ears,&mdash;but
      whether from his hesitation or the distance I could not determine. There
      was no such uncertainty in her reply, however, which was given in her
      usual curt fashion: "All right. You can trapse along home now and turn
      in."
    
    
      She turned the corner of the extension and disappeared. The tall figure of
      the man wavered hesitatingly for a moment, and then vanished also. But I
      was too much excited by curiosity to accept this unsatisfactory
      conclusion, and, hastily picketing Chu Chu a few rods from the front door,
      I ran after him, with an instinctive feeling that he had not gone far. I
      was right. A few paces distant he had halted in the same dubious,
      lingering way. "Hallo!" I said.
    
    
      He turned towards me in the like awkward fashion, but with neither
      astonishment nor concern.
    
    
      "Come up and take a drink with me before you go," I said, "if you're not
      in a hurry. I'm alone here, and since I HAVE turned out I don't see why we
      mightn't have a smoke and a talk together."
    
    
      "I dursn't."
    
    
      I looked up at the six feet of strength before me and repeated
      wonderingly, "Dare not?"
    
    
      "SHE wouldn't like it." He made a movement with his right shoulder towards
      the extension.
    
    
      "Who?"
    
    
      "Miss Karline."
    
    
      "Nonsense!" I said. "She isn't in the cabin,&mdash;you won't see HER. Come
      along." He hesitated, although from what I could discern of his bearded
      face it was weakly smiling.
    
    
      "Come."
    
    
      He obeyed, following me not unlike Chu Chu, I fancied, with the same sense
      of superior size and strength and a slight whitening of the eye, as if
      ready to shy at any moment. At the door he "backed." Then he entered
      sideways. I noticed that he cleared the doorway at the top and the sides
      only by a hair's breadth.
    
    
      By the light of the fire I could see that, in spite of his full first
      growth of beard, he was young,&mdash;even younger than myself,&mdash;and
      that he was by no means bad-looking. As he still showed signs of
      retreating at any moment, I took my flask and tobacco from my saddle-bags,
      handed them to him, pointed to the stool, and sat down myself upon the
      bed.
    
    
      "You live near here?"
    
    
      "Yes," he said a little abstractedly, as if listening for some
      interruption, "at Ten Mile Crossing."
    
    
      "Why, that's two miles away."
    
    
      "I reckon."
    
    
      "Then you don't live here&mdash;on the clearing?"
    
    
      "No. I b'long to the mill at 'Ten Mile.'"
    
    
      "You were on your way home?"
    
    
      "No," he hesitated, looking at his pipe; "I kinder meander round here at
      this time, when Johnson's away, to see if everything's goin' straight."
    
    
      "I see&mdash;you're a friend of the family."
    
    
      "'Deed no!" He stopped, laughed, looked confused, and added, apparently to
      his pipe, "That is, a sorter friend. Not much. SHE"&mdash;he lowered his
      voice as if that potential personality filled the whole cabin&mdash;"wouldn't
      like it."
    
    
      "Then at night, when Johnson's away, you do sentry duty round the house?"
    
    
      "Yes, 'sentry dooty,' that's it,"&mdash;he seemed impressed with the
      suggestion&mdash;"that's it! Sentry dooty. You've struck it, pardner."
    
    
      "And how often is Johnson away?"
    
    
      "'Bout two or three times a week on an average."
    
    
      "But Miss Caroline appears to be able to take care of herself. She has no
      fear."
    
    
      "Fear! Fear wasn't hangin' round when SHE was born!" He paused. "No, sir.
      Did ye ever look into them eyes?"
    
    
      I hadn't, on account of the lashes. But I didn't care to say this, and
      only nodded.
    
    
      "There ain't the created thing livin' or dead, that she can't stand
      straight up to and look at."
    
    
      I wondered if he had fancied she experienced any difficulty in standing up
      before that innocently good-humored face, but I could not resist saying:&mdash;
    
    
      "Then I don't see the use of your walking four miles to look after her."
    
    
      I was sorry for it the next minute, for he seemed to have awkwardly broken
      his pipe, and had to bend down for a long time afterwards to laboriously
      pick up the smallest fragments of it. At last he said, cautiously:
    
    
      "Ye noticed them bits o' flannin' round the chillern's throats?"
    
    
      I remembered that I had, but was uncertain whether it was intended as a
      preventive of cold or a child's idea of decoration. I nodded.
    
    
      "That's their trouble. One night, when old Johnson had been off for three
      days to Coulterville, I was prowling round here and I didn't git to see no
      one, though there was a light burnin' in the shanty all night. The next
      night I was here again,&mdash;the same light twinklin', but no one about.
      I reckoned that was mighty queer, and I jess crep' up to the house an'
      listened. I heard suthin' like a little cough oncet in a while, and at
      times suthin' like a little moan. I didn't durst to sing out for I knew
      SHE wouldn't like it, but whistled keerless like, to let the chillern know
      I was there. But it didn't seem to take. I was jess goin' off, when&mdash;darn
      my skin!&mdash;if I didn't come across the bucket of water I'd fetched up
      from the spring THAT MORNIN', standin' there full, and NEVER TAKEN IN!
      When I saw that I reckoned I'd jess wade in, anyhow, and I knocked. Pooty
      soon the door was half opened, and I saw her eyes blazin' at me like them
      coals. Then SHE 'lowed I'd better 'git up and git,' and shet the door to!
      Then I 'lowed she might tell me what was up&mdash;through the door. Then
      she said, through the door, as how the chillern lay all sick with that
      hoss-distemper, diphthery. Then she 'lowed she'd use a doctor ef I'd fetch
      him. Then she 'lowed again I'd better take the baby that hadn't ketched it
      yet along with me, and leave it where it was safe. Then she passed out the
      baby through the door all wrapped up in a blankit like a papoose, and you
      bet I made tracks with it. I knowed thar wasn't no good going to the mill,
      so I let out for White's, four miles beyond, whar there was White's old
      mother. I told her how things were pointin', and she lent me a hoss, and I
      jess rounded on Doctor Green at Mountain Jim's, and had him back here
      afore sun-up! And then I heard she wilted,&mdash;regularly played out, you
      see,&mdash;for she had it all along wuss than the lot, and never let on or
      whimpered!"
    
    
      "It was well you persisted in seeing her that night," I said, watching the
      rapt expression of his face. He looked up quickly, became conscious of my
      scrutiny, and dropped his eyes again, smiled feebly, and drawing a circle
      in the ashes with the broken pipe-stem, said:&mdash;
    
    
      "But SHE didn't like it, though."
    
    
      I suggested, a little warmly, that if she allowed her father to leave her
      alone at night with delicate children, she had no right to choose WHO
      should assist her in an emergency. It struck me afterwards that this was
      not very complimentary to him, and I added hastily that I wondered if she
      expected some young lady to be passing along the trail at midnight! But
      this reminded me of Johnson's style of argument, and I stopped.
    
    
      "Yes," he said meekly, "and ef she didn't keer enough for herself and her
      brothers and sisters, she orter remember them Beazeley chillern."
    
    
      "Beazeley children?" I repeated wonderingly.
    
    
      "Yes; them two little ones, the size of Mirandy; they're Beazeley's."
    
    
      "Who is Beazeley, and what are his children doing here?"
    
    
      "Beazeley up and died at the mill, and she bedevilled her father to let
      her take his two young 'uns here."
    
    
      "You don't mean to say that with her other work she's taking care of other
      people's children too?"
    
    
      "Yes, and eddicatin' them."
    
    
      "Educating them?"
    
    
      "Yes; teachin' them to read and write and do sums. One of our loggers
      ketched her at it when she was keepin' tally."
    
    
      We were both silent for some moments.
    
    
      "I suppose you know Johnson?" I said finally.
    
    
      "Not much."
    
    
      "But you call here at other times than when you're helping her?"
    
    
      "Never been in the house before."
    
    
      He looked slowly around him as he spoke, raising his eyes to the bare
      rafters above, and drawing a few long breaths, as if he were inhaling the
      aura of some unseen presence. He appeared so perfectly gratified and
      contented, and I was so impressed with this humble and silent absorption
      of the sacred interior, that I felt vaguely conscious that any
      interruption of it was a profanation, and I sat still, gazing at the dying
      fire. Presently he arose, stretched out his hand, shook mine warmly, said,
      "I reckon I'll meander along," took another long breath, this time
      secretly, as if conscious of my eyes, and then slouched sideways out of
      the house into the darkness again, where he seemed suddenly to attain his
      full height, and so looming, disappeared. I shut the door, went to bed,
      and slept soundly.
    
    
      So soundly that when I awoke the sun was streaming on my bed from the open
      door. On the table before me my breakfast was already laid. When I had
      dressed and eaten it, struck by the silence, I went to the door and looked
      out. 'Dolphus was holding Chu Chu by the reata a few paces from the cabin.
    
    
      "Where's Caroline?" I asked.
    
    
      He pointed to the woods and said: "Over yon: keeping tally."
    
    
      "Did she leave any message?"
    
    
      "Said I was to git your mule for you."
    
    
      "Anything else?"
    
    
      "Yes; said you was to go."
    
    
      I went, but not until I had scrawled a few words of thanks on a leaf of my
      notebook, which I wrapped about my last Spanish dollar, addressed it to
      "Miss Johnson," and laid it upon the table.
    
    
    
      It was more than a year later that in the bar-room of the Mariposa Hotel a
      hand was laid upon my sleeve. I looked up. It was Johnson.
    
    
      He drew from his pocket a Spanish dollar. "I reckoned," he said,
      cheerfully, "I'd run again ye somewhar some time. My old woman told me to
      give ye that when I did, and say that she 'didn't keep no hotel.' But she
      allowed she'd keep the letter, and has spelled it out to the chillern."
    
    
      Here was the opportunity I had longed for to touch Johnson's pride and
      affection in the brave but unprotected girl. "I want to talk to you about
      Miss Johnson," I said, eagerly.
    
    
      "I reckon so," he said, with an exasperating smile. "Most fellers do. But
      she ain't Miss Johnson no more. She's married."
    
    
      "Not to that big chap over from Ten Mile Mills?" I said breathlessly.
    
    
      "What's the matter with HIM," said Johnson. "Ye didn't expect her to marry
      a nobleman, did ye?"
    
    
      I said I didn't see why she shouldn't&mdash;and believed that she HAD.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      THE NEW ASSISTANT AT PINE CLEARING SCHOOL.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER I.
    
    
      The schoolmistress of Pine Clearing was taking a last look around her
      schoolroom before leaving it for the day. She might have done so with
      pride, for the schoolroom was considered a marvel of architectural
      elegance by the citizens, and even to the ordinary observer was a pretty,
      villa-like structure, with an open cupola and overhanging roof of
      diamond-shaped shingles and a deep Elizabethan porch. But it was the
      monument of a fierce struggle between a newer civilization and a barbarism
      of the old days, which had resulted in the clearing away of the pines&mdash;and
      a few other things as incongruous to the new life and far less innocent,
      though no less sincere. It had cost the community fifteen thousand
      dollars, and the lives of two of its citizens.
    
    
      Happily there was no stain of this on the clean white walls, the
      beautifully-written gilt texts, or the shining blackboard that had offered
      no record which could not be daily wiped away. And, certainly, the last
      person in the world to suggest any reminiscences of its belligerent
      foundation was the person of the schoolmistress. Mature, thin, precise,&mdash;not
      pretty enough to have excited Homeric feuds, nor yet so plain as to
      preclude certain soothing graces,&mdash;she was the widow of a poor
      Congregational minister, and had been expressly imported from San
      Francisco to squarely mark the issue between the regenerate and
      unregenerate life. Low-voiced, gentlewomanly, with the pallor of
      ill-health perhaps unduly accented by her mourning, which was still cut
      modishly enough to show off her spare but good figure, she was supposed to
      represent the model of pious, scholastic refinement. The Opposition&mdash;sullen
      in ditches and at the doors of saloons, or in the fields truculent as
      their own cattle&mdash;nevertheless had lowered their crests and buttoned
      their coats over their revolutionary red shirts when SHE went by.
    
    
      As she was stepping from the threshold, she was suddenly confronted by a
      brisk business-looking man, who was about to enter. "Just in time to catch
      you, Mrs. Martin," he said hurriedly; then, quickly correcting his
      manifest familiarity, he added: "I mean, I took the liberty of running in
      here on my way to the stage office. That matter you spoke of is all
      arranged. I talked it over with the other trustees, wrote to Sam Barstow,
      and he's agreeable, and has sent somebody up, and," he rapidly consulted
      his watch, "he ought to be here now; and I'm on my way to meet him with
      the other trustees."
    
    
      Mrs. Martin, who at once recognized her visitor as the Chairman of the
      School Board, received the abrupt information with the slight
      tremulousness, faint increase of color, and hurried breathing of a nervous
      woman.
    
    
      "But," she said, "it was only a SUGGESTION of mine, Mr. Sperry; I really
      have no right to ask&mdash;I had no idea"&mdash;
    
    
      "It's all right, ma'am,&mdash;never you mind. We put the case square to
      Barstow. We allowed that the school was getting too large for you to
      tackle,&mdash;I mean, you know, to superintend single-handed; and that
      these Pike County boys they're running in on us are a little too big and
      sassy for a lady like you to lasso and throw down&mdash;I mean, to sorter
      control&mdash;don't you see? But, bless you, Sam Barstow saw it all in a
      minit! He just jumped at it. I've got his letter here&mdash;hold on"&mdash;he
      hastily produced a letter from his pocket, glanced ever it, suddenly
      closed it again with embarrassed quickness, yet not so quickly but that
      the woman's quicker eyes were caught, and nervously fascinated by the
      expression "I'm d&mdash;&mdash;d" in a large business hand&mdash;and said
      in awkward haste, "No matter about reading it now&mdash;keep you too long&mdash;but
      he's agreed all right, you know. Must go now&mdash;they'll be waiting.
      Only I thought I'd drop in a-passin', to keep you posted;" and, taking off
      his hat, he began to back from the porch.
    
    
      "Is&mdash;is&mdash;this gentleman who is to assist me&mdash;a&mdash;a
      mature professional man&mdash;or a&mdash;graduate?" hesitated Mrs. Martin,
      with a faint smile.
    
    
      "Don't really know&mdash;I reckon Sam&mdash;Mr. Barstow&mdash;fixed that
      all right. Must really go now;" and, still holding his hat in his hand as
      a polite compromise for his undignified haste, he fairly ran off.
    
    
      Arrived at the stage office, he found the two other trustees awaiting him,
      and the still more tardy stage-coach. One, a large, smooth-faced, portly
      man, was the Presbyterian minister; the other, of thinner and more serious
      aspect, was a large mill-owner.
    
    
      "I presume," said the Rev. Mr. Peaseley, slowly, "that as our good brother
      Barstow, in the urgency of the occasion, has, to some extent, anticipated
      OUR functions in engaging this assistant, he is&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;satisfied
      with his capacity?"
    
    
      "Sam knows what he's about," said the mill-owner cheerfully, "and as he's
      regularly buckled down to the work here, and will go his bottom dollar on
      it, you can safely leave things to him."
    
    
      "He certainly has exhibited great zeal," said the reverend gentleman
      patronizingly.
    
    
      "Zeal," echoed Sperry enthusiastically, "zeal? Why, he runs Pine Clearing
      as he runs his bank and his express company in Sacramento, and he's as
      well posted as if he were here all the time. Why, look here;" he nudged
      the mill-owner secretly, and, as the minister's back was momentarily
      turned, pulled out the letter he had avoided reading to Mrs. Martin, and
      pointed to a paragraph. "I'll be d&mdash;&mdash;d," said the writer, "but
      I'll have peace and quietness at Pine Clearing, if I have to wipe out or
      make over the whole Pike County gang. Draw on me for a piano if you think
      Mrs. Martin can work it. But don't say anything to Peaseley first, or
      he'll want it changed for a harmonium, and that lets us in for
      psalm-singing till you can't rest. Mind! I don't object to Church
      influence&mdash;it's a good hold!&mdash;but you must run IT with other
      things equal, and not let it run YOU. I've got the schoolhouse insured for
      thirty thousand dollars&mdash;special rates too."
    
    
      The mill-owner smiled. "Sam's head is level! But," he added, "he don't say
      much about the new assistant he's sending."
    
    
      "Only here," he says, "I reckon the man I send will do all round; for Pike
      County has its claims as well as Boston."
    
    
      "What does that mean?" asked the mill-owner.
    
    
      "I reckon he means he don't want Pine Clearing to get too high-toned any
      more than he wants it too low down. He's mighty square in his averages&mdash;is
      Sam."
    
    
      Here speculation was stopped by the rapid oncoming of the stage-coach in
      all the impotent fury of a belated arrival. "Had to go round by Montezuma
      to let off Jack Hill," curtly explained the driver, as he swung himself
      from the box, and entered the hotel bar-room in company with the new
      expressman, who had evidently taken Hill's place on the box-seat.
      Autocratically indifferent to further inquiry, he called out cheerfully:
      "Come along, boys, and hear this yer last new yarn about Sam Barstow,&mdash;it's
      the biggest thing out." And in another moment the waiting crowd, with
      glasses in their hands, were eagerly listening to the repetition of the
      "yarn" from the new expressman, to the apparent exclusion of other
      matters, mundane and practical.
    
    
      Thus debarred from information, the three trustees could only watch the
      passengers as they descended, and try to identify their expected stranger.
      But in vain: the bulk of the passengers they already knew, the others were
      ordinary miners and laborers; there was no indication of the new assistant
      among them. Pending further inquiry they were obliged to wait the
      conclusion of the expressman's humorous recital. This was evidently a
      performance of some artistic merit, depending upon a capital imitation of
      an Irishman, a German Jew, and another voice, which was universally
      recognized and applauded as being "Sam's style all over!" But for the
      presence of the minister, Sperry and the mill-owner would have joined the
      enthusiastic auditors, and inwardly regretted the respectable obligations
      of their official position.
    
    
      When the story-teller had concluded amidst a general call for more drinks,
      Sperry approached the driver. The latter recognizing him, turned to his
      companion carelessly, said, "Here's one of 'em," and was going away when
      Sperry stopped him.
    
    
      "We were expecting a young man."
    
    
      "Yes," said the driver, impatiently, "and there he is, I reckon."
    
    
      "We don't mean the new expressman," said the minister, smiling blandly,
      "but a young man who"&mdash;
    
    
      "THAT ain't no new expressman," returned the driver in scornful
      deprecation of his interlocutor's ignorance. "He only took Hill's place
      from Montezuma. He's the new kid reviver and polisher for that University
      you're runnin' here. I say&mdash;you fellers oughter get him to tell you
      that story of Sam Barstow and the Chinaman. It'd limber you fellers up to
      hear it."
    
    
      "I fear there's some extraordinary mistake here," said Mr. Peaseley, with
      a chilling Christian smile.
    
    
      "Not a bit of it. He's got a letter from Sam for one of ye. Yere, Charley&mdash;what's
      your name! Com yere. Yere's all yer three bosses waiting for ye."
    
    
      And the supposed expressman and late narrator of amusing stories came
      forward and presented his credentials as the assistant teacher of Pine
      Clearing.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II.
    
    
      Even the practical Mr. Sperry was taken aback. The young man before him
      was squarely built, with broad shoulders, and a certain air of muscular
      activity. But his face, although good-humored, was remarkable for offering
      not the slightest indication of studious preoccupation or mental training.
      A large mouth, light blue eyes, a square jaw, the other features being
      indistinctive&mdash;were immobile as a mask&mdash;except that, unlike a
      mask, they seemed to actually reflect the vacuity of the mood within,
      instead of concealing it. But as he saluted the trustees they each had the
      same feeling that even this expression was imported and not instinctive.
      His face was clean-shaven, and his hair cut so short as to suggest that a
      wig of some kind was necessary to give it characteristic or even ordinary
      human semblance. His manner, self-assured yet lacking reality, and his
      dress of respectable cut and material, yet worn as if it did not belong to
      him, completed a picture as unlike a student or schoolmaster as could be
      possibly conceived.
    
    
      Yet there was the letter in Mr. Peaseley's hands from Barstow, introducing
      Mr. Charles Twing as the first assistant teacher in the Pine Clearing Free
      Academy!
    
    
      The three men looked hopelessly at each other. An air of fatigued
      righteousness and a desire to be spiritually at rest from other trials
      pervaded Mr. Peaseley. Whether or not the young man felt the evident
      objection he had raised, he assumed a careless position, with his back and
      elbows against the bar; but even the attitude was clearly not his own.
    
    
      "Are you personally known to Mr. Barstow?" asked Sperry, with a slight
      business asperity.
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      "That is&mdash;you are quite well acquainted with him?"
    
    
      "If you'd heard me gag his style a minute ago, so that everybody here knew
      who it was, you'd say so."
    
    
      Mr. Peaseley's eyes sought the ceiling, and rested on the hanging lamp, as
      if nothing short of direct providential interference could meet the
      occasion. Yet, as the eyes of his brother trustees were bent on him
      expectantly, he nerved himself to say something.
    
    
      "I suppose, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Twing, you have properly understood the great&mdash;I
      may say, very grave, intellectual, and moral responsibilities of the work
      you seek to undertake&mdash;and the necessity of supporting it by EXAMPLE,
      by practice, by personal influence both in the school and OUT OF IT. Sir,
      I presume, sir, you feel that you are fully competent to undertake this?"
    
    
      "I reckon HE does!"
    
    
      "WHO does?"
    
    
      "Sam Barstow, or he wouldn't have selected me. I presume" (with the
      slightest possible and almost instinctive imitation of the reverend
      gentleman's manner) "his head is considered level."
    
    
      Mr. Peaseley withdrew his eyes from the ceiling. "I have," he said to his
      companions, with a pained smile, "an important choir meeting to attend
      this afternoon. I fear I must be excused." As he moved towards the door,
      the others formally following him, until out of the stranger's hearing, he
      added: "I wash my hands of this. After so wanton and unseemly an
      exhibition of utter incompetency, and even of understanding of the trust
      imposed upon him&mdash;upon US&mdash;MY conscience forbids me to interfere
      further. But the real arbiter in this matter will be&mdash;thank Heaven!&mdash;the
      mistress herself. You have only to confront her at once with this man. HER
      decision will be speedy and final. For even Mr. Barstow will not dare to
      force so outrageous a character upon a delicate, refined woman, in a
      familiar and confidential capacity."
    
    
      "That's so," said Sperry eagerly; "she'll settle it. And, of course,"
      added the mill-owner, "that will leave us out of any difficulty with Sam."
    
    
      The two men returned to the hapless stranger, relieved, yet constrained by
      the sacrifice to which they felt they were leading him. It would be
      necessary, they said, to introduce him to his principal, Mrs. Martin, at
      once. They might still find her at the schoolhouse, distant but a few
      steps. They said little else, the stranger keeping up an ostentatious
      whistling, and becoming more and more incongruous, they thought, as they
      neared the pretty schoolhouse. Here they DID find Mrs. Martin, who had,
      naturally, lingered after the interview with Sperry.
    
    
      She came forward to meet them, with the nervous shyness and slightly
      fastidious hesitation that was her nature. They saw, or fancied they saw,
      the same surprise and disappointment they had themselves experienced pass
      over her sensitive face, as she looked at him; they felt that their vulgar
      charge appeared still more outrageous by contrast with this delicate woman
      and her pretty, refined surroundings; but they saw that HE enjoyed it, and
      was even&mdash;if such a word could be applied to so self-conscious a man&mdash;more
      at ease in her presence!
    
    
      "I reckon you and me will pull together very well, ma'am," he said
      confidently.
    
    
      They looked to see her turn her back upon him; faint, or burst out crying;
      but she did neither, and only gazed at him quietly.
    
    
      "It's a mighty pretty place you've got here&mdash;and I like it, and if WE
      can't run it, I don't know who can. Only just let me know WHAT you want,
      ma'am, and you can count on me every time."
    
    
      To their profound consternation Mrs. Martin smiled faintly.
    
    
      "It rests with YOU only, Mrs. Martin," said Sperry quickly and
      significantly. "It's YOUR say, you know; you're the only one to be
      considered or consulted here."
    
    
      "Only just say what you want me to do," continued Twing, apparently
      ignoring the trustees; "pick out the style of job; give me a hint or two
      how to work it, or what you'd think would be the proper gag to fetch 'em,
      and I'm there, ma'am. It may be new at first, but I'll get at the business
      of it quick enough."
    
    
      Mrs. Martin smiled&mdash;this time quite perceptibly&mdash;with the least
      little color in her cheeks and eyes. "Then you've had no experience in
      teaching?" she said.
    
    
      "Well no."
    
    
      "You are not a graduate of any college?"
    
    
      "Not much."
    
    
      The two trustees looked at each other. Even Mr. Peaseley had not conceived
      such a damning revelation.
    
    
      "Well," said Mrs. Martin slowly, "perhaps Mr. Twing had better COME EARLY
      TOMORROW MORNING AND BEGIN."
    
    
      "Begin?" gasped Mr. Sperry in breathless astonishment.
    
    
      "Certainly," said Mrs. Martin in timid explanation. "If he is new to the
      work the sooner the better."
    
    
      Mr. Sperry could only gaze blankly at his brother official. Had they heard
      aright? Was this the recklessness of nervous excitement in a woman of
      delicate health, or had the impostor cast some glamour upon her? Or was
      she frightened of Sam Barstow and afraid to reject his candidate? The last
      thought was an inspiration. He drew her quickly aside. "One moment, Mrs.
      Martin! You said to me an hour ago that you didn't intend to have asked
      Mr. Barstow to send you an assistant. I hope that, merely because he HAS
      done so, you don't feel obliged to accept this man against your better
      judgment?"
    
    
      "Oh no," said Mrs. Martin quietly.
    
    
      The case seemed hopeless. And Sperry had the miserable conviction that by
      having insisted upon Mrs. Martin's judgment being final they had estopped
      their own right to object. But how could they have foreseen her
      extraordinary taste? He, however, roused himself for a last appeal.
    
    
      "Mrs. Martin," he said in a lower voice, "I ought to tell you that the
      Reverend Mr. Peaseley strongly doubts the competency of that young man."
    
    
      "Didn't Mr. Barstow make a selection at your request?" asked Mrs. Martin,
      with a faint little nervous cough.
    
    
      "Yes&mdash;but"&mdash;
    
    
      "Then his competency only concerns ME&mdash;and I don't see what Mr.
      Peaseley has to say about it."
    
    
      Could he believe his senses? There was a decided flush in the woman's pale
      face, and the first note of independence and asperity in her voice.
    
    
      That night, in the privacy of his conjugal chamber, Mr. Sperry relieved
      his mind to another of the enigmatical sex,&mdash;the stout Southwestern
      partner of his joys and troubles. But the result was equally
      unsatisfactory. "Well, Abner," said the lady, "I never could see, for all
      your men's praises of Mrs. Martin, what that feller can see in HER to
      like!"
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER III.
    
    
      Mrs. Martin was early at the schoolhouse the next morning, yet not so
      early but that she discovered that the new assistant had been there before
      her. This was shown in some rearrangement of the school seats and benches.
      They were placed so as to form a horseshoe before her desk, and at the
      further extremity of this semicircle was a chair evidently for himself.
      She was a little nettled at his premature action, although admitting the
      utility of the change, but she was still more annoyed at his absence at
      such a moment. It was nearly the school hour when he appeared, to her
      surprise, marshaling a file of some of the smaller children whom he had
      evidently picked up en route, and who were, to her greater surprise,
      apparently on the best of terms with him. "Thought I'd better rake 'em in,
      introduce myself to 'em, and get 'em to know me before school begins.
      Excuse me," he went on hastily, "but I've a lot more coming up, and I'd
      better make myself square with them OUTSIDE." But Mrs. Martin had
      apparently developed a certain degree of stiffness since their evening's
      interview.
    
    
      "It seems to me quite as important, Mr. Twing," she said drily, "that you
      should first learn some of your own duties, which I came here early to
      teach you."
    
    
      "Not at all," he said cheerfully. "Today I take my seat, as I've arranged
      it, you see, over there with them, and watch 'em go through the motions.
      One rehearsal's enough for ME. At the same time, I can chip in if
      necessary." And before she could reply he was out of the schoolhouse
      again, hailing the new-comers. This was done with apparently such delight
      to the children and with some evidently imported expression into his
      smooth mask-like face, that Mrs. Martin had to content herself with
      watching him with equal curiosity. She was turning away with a sudden
      sense of forgotten dignity, when a shout of joyous, childish laughter
      attracted her attention to the window. The new assistant, with half a
      dozen small children on his square shoulders, walking with bent back and
      every simulation of advanced senility, was evidently personating, with the
      assistance of astonishingly distorted features, the ogre of a Christmas
      pantomime. As his eye caught hers the expression vanished, the mask-like
      face returned; he set the children down, and moved away. And when school
      began, although he marshaled them triumphantly to the very door,&mdash;with
      what contortion of face or simulation of character she was unable to
      guess,&mdash;after he had entered the schoolroom and taken his seat every
      vestige of his previous facial aberration was gone, and only his usual
      stolidity remained. In vain, as Mrs. Martin expected, the hundred
      delighted little eyes before her dwelt at first eagerly and hopefully upon
      his face, but, as she HAD NOT expected, recognizing from the blankness of
      his demeanor that the previous performance was intended for them
      exclusively, the same eager eyes were presently dropped again upon their
      books in simple imitation, as if he were one of themselves. Mrs. Martin
      breathed freely, and lessons began.
    
    
      Yet she was nervously conscious, meanwhile, of a more ill-omened
      occurrence. This was the non-arrival of several of her oldest pupils,
      notably, the refractory and incorrigible Pike County contingent to whom
      Sperry had alluded. For the past few days they had hovered on the verge of
      active insubordination, and had indulged in vague mutterings which she had
      resolutely determined not to hear. It was, therefore, with some inward
      trepidations, not entirely relieved by Twing's presence, that she saw the
      three Mackinnons and the two Hardees slouch into the school a full hour
      after the lessons had begun. They did not even excuse themselves, but were
      proceeding with a surly and ostentatious defiance to their seats, when
      Mrs. Martin was obliged to look up, and&mdash;as the eldest Hardee filed
      before her&mdash;to demand an explanation. The culprit addressed&mdash;a
      dull, heavy-looking youth of nineteen&mdash;hesitated with an air of
      mingled doggedness and sheepishness, and then, without replying, nudged
      his companion. It was evidently a preconcerted signal of rebellion, for
      the boy nudged stopped, and, turning a more intelligent, but equally
      dissatisfied, face upon the schoolmistress, began determinedly:&mdash;
    
    
      "Wot's our excuse for coming an hour late? Well, we ain't got none. WE
      don't call it an hour late&mdash;WE don't. We call it the right time. We
      call it the right time for OUR lessons, for we don't allow to come here to
      sing hymns with babbies. We don't want to know 'where, oh where, are the
      Hebrew children?' They ain't nothin' to us Americans. And we don't want
      any more Daniels in the Lions' Den played off on us. We have enough of 'em
      in Sunday-school. We ain't hankerin' much for grammar and dictionary
      hogwash, and we don't want no Boston parts o' speech rung in on us the
      first thing in the mo'nin'. We ain't Boston&mdash;we're Pike County&mdash;WE
      are. We reckon to do our sums, and our figgerin', and our sale and barter,
      and our interest tables and weights and measures when the time comes, and
      our geograffy when it's on, and our readin' and writin' and the American
      Constitution in reg'lar hours, and then we calkilate to git up and git
      afore the po'try and the Boston airs and graces come round. That's our
      rights and what our fathers pay school taxes for, and we want 'em."
    
    
      He stopped, looking less towards the schoolmistress than to his
      companions, for whom perhaps, after the schoolboy fashion, this attitude
      was taken. Mrs. Martin sat, quite white and self-contained, with her eyes
      fixed on the frayed rim of the rebel's straw hat which he still kept on
      his head. Then she said quietly:&mdash;
    
    
      "Take off your hat, sir."
    
    
      The boy did not move.
    
    
      "He can't," said a voice cheerfully.
    
    
      It was the new assistant. The whole school faced rapidly towards him. The
      rebel leader and his followers, who had not noticed him before, stared at
      the interrupter, who did not, however, seem to exhibit any of the
      authority of office, but rather the comment and criticism of one of
      themselves. "Wot you mean?" asked the boy indignantly.
    
    
      "I mean you can't take off your hat because you've got some things stowed
      away in it you don't want seen," said Twing, with an immovable face.
    
    
      "Wot things?" exclaimed the boy angrily. Then suddenly recollecting
      himself, he added, "Go along! You can't fool me! Think you'll make me take
      off my hat&mdash;don't you?"
    
    
      "Well," said Twing, advancing to the side of the rebel, "look here then!"
      With a dexterous movement and a slight struggle from the boy, he lifted
      the hat. A half-dozen apples, a bird's nest, two birds' eggs, and a
      fluttering half-fledged bird fell from it. A wave of delight and
      astonishment ran along the benches, a blank look of hopeless bewilderment
      settled upon the boy's face, and the gravity of the situation disappeared
      forever in the irrepressible burst of laughter, in which even his brother
      rebels joined. The smallest child who had been half-frightened,
      half-fascinated by the bold, bad, heroic attitude of the mutineer, was
      quick to see the ridiculousness of that figure crowned with cheap
      schoolboy plunder. The eloquent protest of his wrongs was lost in the
      ludicrous appearance of the protester. Even Mrs. Martin felt that nothing
      she could say at that moment could lift the rebellion into seriousness
      again. But Twing was evidently not satisfied.
    
    
      "Beg Mrs. Martin's pardon, and say you were foolin' with the boys," he
      said in a low voice.
    
    
      The discomfited rebel hesitated.
    
    
      "Say it, or I'll SHOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR POCKETS!" said Twing in a
      terribly significant aside.
    
    
      The boy mumbled an apology to Mrs. Martin, scrambled in a blank, hopeless
      way to his seat, and the brief rebellion ignominiously ended. But two
      things struck Mrs. Martin as peculiar. She overheard the culprit say, with
      bated breath and evident sincerity, to his comrades: "Hadn't nothing in my
      hat, anyway!" and one of the infant class was heard to complain, in a
      deeply-injured way, that the bird's nest was HIS, and had been "stoled"
      from his desk. And there still remained the fact for which Twing's
      undoubted fascination over the children had somewhat prepared her&mdash;that
      at recess the malcontents&mdash;one and all&mdash;seemed to have forgiven
      the man who had overcome them, and gathered round him with unmistakable
      interest. All this, however, did not blind her to the serious intent of
      the rebellion, or of Twing's unaccountable assumption of her prerogative.
      While he was still romping with the children she called him in.
    
    
      "I must remind you," she said, with a slight nervous asperity, "that this
      outrageous conduct of Tom Hardee was evidently deliberated and prepared by
      the others, and cannot end in this way."
    
    
      He looked at her with a face so exasperatingly expressionless that she
      could have slapped it as if it had belonged to one of the older scholars,
      and said,&mdash;"But it HAS ended. It's a dead frost."
    
    
      "I don't know what you mean; and I must remind you also that in this
      school we neither teach nor learn slang."
    
    
      His immobile face changed for an instant to a look of such decided
      admiration that she felt her color rise; but he wiped his expression away
      with his hand as if it had been some artificial make-up, and said
      awkwardly, but earnestly:&mdash;
    
    
      "Excuse me&mdash;won't you? But, look here, Mrs. Martin, I found out early
      this morning, when I was squaring myself with the other children, that
      there was this row hangin' on&mdash;in fact, that there was a sort of idea
      that Pike County wasn't having a fair show&mdash;excuse me&mdash;in the
      running of the school, and that Peaseley and Barstow were a little too
      much on in every scene. In fact, you see, it was just what Tom said."
    
    
      "This is insufferable," said Mrs. Martin, her eyes growing darker as her
      cheeks grew red. "They shall go home to their parents, and tell them from
      me"&mdash;
    
    
      "That they're all mistaken&mdash;excuse me&mdash;but that's just what
      THEY'RE GOIN' TO DO. I tell you, Mrs. Martin, their little game's busted&mdash;I
      beg pardon&mdash;but it's all over. You'll have no more trouble with
      them."
    
    
      "And you think that just because you found Tom had something in his hat,
      and exposed him?" said Mrs. Martin scornfully.
    
    
      "Tom HADN'T anything in his hat," said Twing, wiping his mouth slowly.
    
    
      "Nothing?" repeated Mrs. Martin.
    
    
      "No."
    
    
      "But I SAW you take the things out."
    
    
      "That was only a TRICK! He had nothing except what I had up my sleeve, and
      forced on him. He knew it, and that frightened him, and made him look like
      a fool, and so bursted up his conspiracy. There's nothin' boys are more
      afraid of than ridicule, or the man or boy that make 'em ridiculous."
    
    
      "I won't ask you if you call this FAIR to the boy, Mr. Twing?" said Mrs.
      Martin hotly; "but is this your idea of discipline?"
    
    
      "I call it fair, because Tom knew it was some kind of a trick, and wasn't
      deceived. I call it discipline if it made him do what was right
      afterwards, and makes him afraid or unwilling to do anything to offend me
      or you again. He likes me none the worse for giving him a chance of being
      laughed out of a thing instead of being DRIVEN out of it. And," he added,
      with awkward earnestness, "if you'll just leave all this to ME, and only
      consider me here to take this sort of work which ain't a lady's&mdash;off
      your hands, we'll just strike our own line between the Peaseleys and Pike
      County&mdash;and run this school in spite of both."
    
    
      A little mollified, a good deal puzzled, and perhaps more influenced by
      the man's manner than she had imagined, Mrs. Martin said nothing, but let
      the day pass without dismissing the offenders. And on returning home that
      evening she was considerably surprised to receive her landlady's
      extravagant congratulations on the advent of her new assistant. "And they
      do say, Mrs. Martin," continued that lady enthusiastically, "that your
      just setting your foot down square on that Peaseley and that Barstow, BOTH
      OF 'EM&mdash;and choosing your own assistant yourself&mdash;a plain young
      fellow with no frills and fancies, but one that you could set about making
      all the changes you like, was just the biggest thing you ever did for Pine
      Clearing."
    
    
      "And&mdash;they&mdash;consider him quite&mdash;competent?" said Mrs.
      Martin, with timid color and hesitating audacity.
    
    
      "Competent! You ask my Johnny."
    
    
      Nevertheless, Mrs. Martin was somewhat formally early at the schoolhouse
      the next morning. "Perhaps," she said, with an odd mixture of dignity and
      timidity, "we'd better, before school commences, go over the lessons for
      the day."
    
    
      "I HAVE," he said quickly. "I told you ONE rehearsal was enough for me."
    
    
      "You mean you have looked over them?"
    
    
      "Got 'em by heart. Letter perfect. Want to hear me? Listen."
    
    
      She did. He had actually committed to memory, and without a lapse, the
      entire text of rules, questions, answers, and examples of the lessons for
      the day.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IV.
    
    
      Before a month had passed, Mr. Twing's success was secure and established.
      So were a few of the changes he had quietly instituted. The devotional
      singing and Scripture reading which had excited the discontent of the Pike
      County children and their parents was not discontinued, but half an hour
      before recess was given up to some secular choruses, patriotic or topical,
      in which the little ones under Twing's really wonderful practical tuition
      exhibited such quick and pleasing proficiency, that a certain negro
      minstrel camp-meeting song attained sufficient popularity to be lifted by
      general accord to promotion to the devotional exercises, where it
      eventually ousted the objectionable "Hebrew children" on the question of
      melody alone. Grammar was still taught at Pine Clearing School in spite of
      the Hardees and Mackinnons, but Twing had managed to import into the
      cognate exercises of recitation a wonderful degree of enthusiasm and
      excellence. Dialectical Pike County, that had refused to recognize the
      governing powers of the nominative case, nevertheless came out strong in
      classical elocution, and Tom Hardee, who had delivered his ungrammatical
      protest on behalf of Pike County, was no less strong, if more elegant, in
      his impeachment of Warren Hastings as Edmund Burke, with the equal
      sanction of his parents. The trustees, Sperry and Jackson, had marveled,
      but were glad enough to accept the popular verdict&mdash;only Mr. Peaseley
      still retained an attitude of martyr-like forbearance and fatigued
      toleration towards the new assistant and his changes. As to Mrs. Martin,
      she seemed to accept the work of Mr. Twing after his own definition of it&mdash;as
      of a masculine quality ill-suited to a lady's tastes and inclinations; but
      it was noticeable that while she had at first repelled any criticism of
      him whatever, she had lately been given to explaining his position to her
      friends, and had spoken of him with somewhat labored and ostentatious
      patronage. Yet when they were alone together she frankly found him very
      amusing, and his presumption and vulgarity so clearly unintentional that
      it no longer offended her. They were good friends without having any
      confidences beyond the duties of the school; she had asked no further
      explanation of the fact that he had been selected by Mr. Barstow without
      reference to any special antecedent training. What his actual antecedents
      were she had never cared to know, nor he apparently to reveal; that he had
      been engaged in some other occupations of superior or inferior quality
      would not have been remarkable in a community where the principal lawyer
      had been a soldier, and the miller a doctor. The fact that he admired her
      was plain enough to HER; that it pleased her, but carried with it no
      ulterior thought or responsibility, might have been equally clear to
      others. Perhaps it was so to HIM.
    
    
      Howbeit, this easy mutual intercourse was one day interrupted by what
      seemed a trifling incident. The piano, which Mr. Barstow had promised,
      duly made its appearance in the schoolhouse, to the delight of the
      scholars and the gentle satisfaction of Mrs. Martin, who, in addition to
      the rudimentary musical instruction of the younger girls, occasionally
      played upon it herself in a prim, refined, and conscientious fashion. To
      this, when she was alone after school hours, she sometimes added a faint,
      colorless voice of limited range and gentlewomanly expression. It was on
      one of these occasions that Twing, becoming an accidental auditor of this
      chaste, sad piping, was not only permitted to remain to hear the end of a
      love song of strictly guarded passion in the subjunctive mood, but at the
      close was invited to try his hand&mdash;a quick, if not a cultivated one&mdash;at
      the instrument. He did so. Like her, he added his voice. Like hers, it was
      a love song. But there the similitude ended. Negro in dialect, illiterate
      in construction, idiotic in passion, and presumably addressed to the "Rose
      of Alabama," in the very extravagance of its childish infatuation it might
      have been a mockery of the schoolmistress's song but for one tremendous
      fact! In unrestrained feeling, pathetic yearning, and exquisite tenderness
      of expression, it was unmistakably and appallingly personal and sincere.
      It was true the lips spoken of were "lubly," the eyes alluded to were like
      "lightenin' bugs," but from the voice and gestures of the singer Mrs.
      Martin confusedly felt that they were intended for HERS, and even the
      refrain that "she dressed so neat and looked so sweet" was glaringly
      allusive to her own modish mourning. Alternately flushing and paling, with
      a hysteric smile hovering round her small reserved mouth, the unfortunate
      gentlewoman was fain to turn to the window to keep her countenance until
      it was concluded. She did not ask him to repeat it, nor did she again
      subject herself to this palpable serenade, but a few days afterwards, as
      she was idly striking the keys in the interval of a music lesson, one of
      her little pupils broke out, "Why, Mrs. Martin, if yo ain't a pickin' out
      that pow'ful pretty tune that Mr. Twing sings!"
    
    
      Nevertheless, when Twing, a week or two later, suggested that he might
      sing the same song as a solo at a certain performance to be given by the
      school children in aid of a local charity, she drily intimated that it was
      hardly of a character to suit the entertainment. "But," she added, more
      gently, "you recite so well; why not give a recitation?"
    
    
      He looked at her with questioning and troubled eyes,&mdash;the one
      expression he seemed to have lately acquired. "But that would be IN
      PUBLIC! There'll be a lot of people there," he said doubtfully.
    
    
      A little amused at this first apparent sign of a want of confidence in
      himself, she said, with a reassuring smile, "So much the better,&mdash;you
      do it really too well to have it thrown away entirely on children."
    
    
      "Do YOU wish it?" he said suddenly.
    
    
      Somewhat confused, but more irritated by his abruptness, she replied, "Why
      not?" But when the day came, and before a crowded audience, in which there
      was a fair sprinkling of strangers, she regretted her rash suggestion. For
      when the pupils had gone through certain calisthenic exercises&mdash;admirably
      taught and arranged by him&mdash;and "spoken their pieces," he arose, and,
      fixing his eyes on her, began Othello's defense before the Duke and
      Council. Here, as on the previous occasion, she felt herself personally
      alluded to in his account of his wooing. Desdemona, for some occult
      reason, vicariously appeared for her in the unwarrantable picture of his
      passion, and to this was added the absurd consciousness which she could
      not put aside that the audience, following with enthusiasm his really
      strong declamation, was also following his suggestion and adopting it. Yet
      she was also conscious, and, as she thought, as inconsistently, of being
      pleased and even proud of his success. At the conclusion the applause was
      general, and a voice added with husky admiration and familiarity:&mdash;
    
    
      "Brayvo, Johnny Walker!"
    
    
      Twing's face became suddenly white as a Pierrot mask. There was a dead
      silence, in which the voice continued, "Give us 'Sugar in the Gourd,'
      Johnny."
    
    
      A few hisses, and cries of "Hush!" "Put him out!" followed. Mrs. Martin
      raised her eyes quickly to where her assistant had stood bowing his thanks
      a moment before. He was gone!
    
    
      More concerned than she cared to confess, vaguely fearful that she was in
      some way connected with his abrupt withdrawal, and perhaps a little
      remorseful that she had allowed her personal feelings to interfere with
      her frank recognition of his triumph, she turned back to the schoolroom,
      after the little performers and their audience had departed, in the hope
      that he might return. It was getting late, the nearly level rays of the
      sun were lying on the empty benches at the lower end of the room, but the
      desk where she sat with its lid raised was in deep shadow. Suddenly she
      heard his voice in a rear hall, but it was accompanied by another's,&mdash;the
      same voice which had interrupted the applause. Before she could either
      withdraw, or make herself known, the two men had entered the room, and
      were passing slowly through it. She understood at once that Twing had
      slipped out into a janitor's room in the rear, where he had evidently
      forced an interview and explanation from his interrupter, and now had been
      waiting for the audience to disperse before emerging by the front door.
      They had evidently overlooked her in the shadow.
    
    
      "But," said the stranger, as if following an aggrieved line of apology,
      "if Barstow knew who you were, and what you'd done, and still thought you
      good enough to rastle round here and square up them Pike County fellers
      and them kids&mdash;what in thunder do you care if the others DO find you
      out, as long as Barstow sticks to you?"
    
    
      "I've told you why, Dick," returned Twing gloomily.
    
    
      "Oh, the schoolma'am!"
    
    
      "Yes, she's a saint, an angel. More than that&mdash;she's a lady, Dick, to
      the tip of her fingers, who knows nothing of the world outside a parson's
      study. She took me on trust&mdash;without a word&mdash;when the trustees
      hung back and stared. She's never asked me about myself, and now when she
      knows who and what I have been&mdash;she'll loathe me!"
    
    
      "But look here, Jim," said the stranger anxiously. "I'll say it's all a
      lie. I'll come here and apologize to you afore HER, and say I took you for
      somebody else. I'll"&mdash;
    
    
      "It's too late," said Twing moodily.
    
    
      "And what'll you do?"
    
    
      "Leave here."
    
    
      They had reached the door together. To Mrs. Martin's terror, as the
      stranger passed out, Twing, instead of following him as she expected, said
      "Good-night," and gloomily re-entered the schoolroom. Here he paused a
      moment, and then throwing himself on one of the benches, dropped his head
      upon a desk with his face buried in his hands&mdash;like a very schoolboy.
    
    
      What passed through Mrs. Martin's mind I know not. For a moment she sat
      erect and rigid at her desk. Then she slipped quietly down, and, softly as
      one of the last shadows cast by the dying sun, glided across the floor to
      where he sat.
    
    
      "Mrs. Martin," he said, starting to his feet.
    
    
      "I have heard all," she said faintly. "I couldn't help it. I was here when
      you came in. But I want to tell you that I am content to know you only as
      you seem to be,&mdash;as I have always found you here,&mdash;strong and
      loyal to a duty laid upon you by those who had a full knowledge of all you
      had been."
    
    
      "Did you? Do you know what I have been?"
    
    
      Mrs. Martin looked frightened, trembled a moment, and, recovering herself
      with an effort, said gently, "I know nothing of your past."
    
    
      "Nothing?" he repeated, with a mirthless attempt at laughter, and a quick
      breath. "Not that I've been a&mdash;a&mdash;mountebank, a variety actor&mdash;a
      clown, you know, for the amusement of the lowest, at twenty-five cents a
      ticket. That I'm 'Johnny Walker,' the song and dance man&mdash;the
      all-round man&mdash;selected by Mr. Barstow to teach these boors a lesson
      as to what they wanted!"
    
    
      She looked at him a moment&mdash;timidly, yet thoughtfully. "Then you are
      an actor&mdash;a person who simulates what he does not feel?"
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      "And all the time you have been here you have been acting the schoolmaster&mdash;playing
      a part&mdash;for&mdash;for Mr. Barstow?"
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      "Always?"
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      The color came softly to her face again, and her voice was very low. "And
      when you sang to me that day, and when you looked at me&mdash;as you did&mdash;an
      hour or two ago&mdash;while you were entertaining&mdash;you were&mdash;only&mdash;acting?"
    
    
      Mr. Twing's answer was not known, but it must have been a full and
      complete one, for it was quite dark when he left the schoolroom&mdash;NOT
      for the last time&mdash;with its mistress on his arm.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      IN A PIONEER RESTAURANT.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER I.
    
    
      There was probably no earthly reason why the "Poco Mas o Menos" Club of
      San Francisco should have ever existed, or why its five harmless,
      indistinctive members should not have met and dined together as ordinary
      individuals. Still less was there any justification for the gratuitous
      opinion which obtained, that it was bold, bad, and brilliant. Looking back
      upon it over a quarter of a century and half a globe, I confess I cannot
      recall a single witticism, audacity, or humorous characteristic that
      belonged to it. Yet there was no doubt that we were thought to be
      extremely critical and satirical, and I am inclined to think we honestly
      believed it. To take our seats on Wednesdays and Saturdays at a specially
      reserved table at the restaurant we patronized, to be conscious of being
      observed by the other guests, and of our waiter confidentially imparting
      our fame to strangers behind the shaken-out folds of a napkin, and of
      knowing that the faintest indication of merriment from our table thrilled
      the other guests with anticipatory smiles, was, I am firmly convinced, all
      that we ever did to justify our reputations. Nor, strictly speaking, were
      we remarkable as individuals; an assistant editor, a lawyer, a young army
      quartermaster, a bank clerk and a mining secretary&mdash;we could not
      separately challenge any special social or literary distinction. Yet I am
      satisfied that the very name of our Club&mdash;a common Spanish
      colloquialism, literally meaning "a little more or less," and adopted in
      Californian slang to express an unknown quantity&mdash;was supposed to be
      replete with deep and convulsing humor.
    
    
      My impression is that our extravagant reputation, and, indeed, our
      continued existence as a Club, was due solely to the proprietor of the
      restaurant and two of his waiters, and that we were actually "run" by
      them. When the suggestion of our meeting regularly there was first
      broached to the proprietor&mdash;a German of slow but deep emotions&mdash;he
      received it with a "So" of such impressive satisfaction that it might have
      been the beginning of our vainglory. From that moment he became at once
      our patron and our devoted slave. To linger near our table once or twice
      during dinner with an air of respectful vacuity,&mdash;as of one who knew
      himself too well to be guilty of the presumption of attempting to
      understand our brilliancy,&mdash;to wear a certain parental pride and
      unconsciousness in our fame, and yet to never go further in seeming to
      comprehend it than to obligingly translate the name of the Club as "a
      leedle more and nod quide so much"&mdash;was to him sufficient happiness.
      That he ever experienced any business profit from the custom of the Club,
      or its advertisement, may be greatly doubted; on the contrary, that a few
      plain customers, nettled at our self-satisfaction, might have resented his
      favoritism seemed more probable. Equally vague, disinterested, and loyal
      was the attachment of the two waiters,&mdash;one an Italian, faintly
      reminiscent of better days and possibly superior extraction; the other a
      rough but kindly Western man, who might have taken this menial position
      from temporary stress of circumstances, yet who continued in it from sheer
      dominance of habit and some feebleness of will. They both vied with each
      other to please us. It may have been they considered their attendance upon
      a reputed intellectual company less degrading than ministering to the
      purely animal and silent wants of the average customers. It may have been
      that they were attracted by our general youthfulness. Indeed, I am
      inclined to think that they themselves were much more distinctive and
      interesting than any members of the Club, and it is to introduce THEM that
      I venture to recall so much of its history.
    
    
      A few months after our advent at the restaurant, one evening, Joe Tallant,
      the mining secretary, one of our liveliest members, was observed to be
      awkward and distrait during dinner, forgetting even to offer the usual
      gratuity to the Italian waiter who handed him his hat, although he stared
      at him with an imbecile smile. As we chanced to leave the restaurant
      together, I was rallying him upon his abstraction, when to my surprise he
      said gravely: "Look here, one of two things has got to happen: either we
      must change our restaurant or I'm going to resign."
    
    
      "Why?"
    
    
      "Well, to make matters clear, I'm obliged to tell you something that in
      our business we usually keep a secret. About three weeks ago I had a
      notice to transfer twenty feet of Gold Hill to a fellow named 'Tournelli.'
      Well, Tournelli happened to call for it himself, and who the devil do you
      suppose Tournelli was? Why our Italian waiter. I was regularly startled,
      and so was he. But business is business; so I passed him over the stock
      and said nothing&mdash;nor did he&mdash;neither there nor here. Day before
      yesterday he had thirty feet more transferred to him, and sold out."
    
    
      "Well?" I said impatiently.
    
    
      "Well," repeated Tallant indignantly. "Gold Hill's worth six hundred
      dollars a foot. That's eighteen thousand dollars cash. And a man who's
      good enough for that much money is too good to wait upon me. Fancy a man
      who could pay my whole year's salary with five feet of stock slinging hash
      to ME. Fancy YOU tipping him with a quarter!"
    
    
      "But if HE don't mind it&mdash;and prefers to continue a waiter&mdash;why
      should YOU care? And WE'RE not supposed to know."
    
    
      "That's just it," groaned Tallant. "That's just where the sell comes in.
      Think how he must chuckle over us! No, sir! There's nothing aristocratic
      about me; but, by thunder, if I can't eat my dinner, and feel I am as good
      as the man who waits on me, I'll resign from the Club."
    
    
      After endeavoring to point out to him the folly of such a proceeding, I
      finally suggested that we should take the other members of our Club into
      our confidence, and abide by their decision; to which he agreed. But, to
      his chagrin, the others, far from participating in his delicacy, seemed to
      enjoy Tournelli's unexpected wealth with a vicarious satisfaction and
      increase of dignity as if we were personally responsible for it. Although
      it had been unanimously agreed that we should make no allusions, jocose or
      serious, to him, nor betray any knowledge of it before him, I am afraid
      our attitude at the next dinner was singularly artificial. A nervous
      expectancy when he approached us, and a certain restraint during his
      presence, a disposition to check any discussion of shares or "strikes" in
      mining lest he should think it personal, an avoidance of unnecessary or
      trifling "orders," and a singular patience in awaiting their execution
      when given; a vague hovering between sympathetic respect and the other
      extreme of indifferent bluntness in our requests, tended, I think, to make
      that meal far from exhilarating. Indeed, the unusual depression affected
      the unfortunate cause of it, who added to our confusion by increased
      solicitude of service and&mdash;as if fearful of some fault, or having
      incurred our disfavor&mdash;by a deprecatory and exaggerated humility that
      in our sensitive state seemed like the keenest irony. At last, evidently
      interpreting our constraint before him into a desire to be alone, he
      retired to the door of a distant pantry, whence he surveyed us with dark
      and sorrowful Southern eyes. Tallant, who in this general embarrassment
      had been imperfectly served, and had eaten nothing, here felt his
      grievance reach its climax, and in a sudden outbreak of recklessness he
      roared out, "Hi, waiter&mdash;you, Tournelli. He may," he added, turning
      darkly to us, "buy up enough stock to control the board and dismiss ME;
      but, by thunder, if it costs me my place, I'm going to have some more
      chicken!"
    
    
      It was probably this sensitiveness that kept us from questioning him, even
      indirectly, and perhaps led us into the wildest surmises. He was acting
      secretly for a brotherhood or society of waiters; he was a silent partner
      of his German employer; he was a disguised Italian stockbroker, gaining
      "points" from the unguarded conversation of "operating" customers; he was
      a political refugee with capital; he was a fugitive Sicilian bandit,
      investing his ill-gotten gains in California; he was a dissipated young
      nobleman, following some amorous intrigue across the ocean, and acting as
      his own Figaro or Leporello. I think a majority of us favored the latter
      hypothesis, possibly because we were young, and his appearance gave it
      color. His thin black mustaches and dark eyes, we felt, were Tuscan and
      aristocratic; at least, they were like the baritone who played those
      parts, and HE ought to know. Yet nothing could be more exemplary and
      fastidious than his conduct towards the few lady frequenters of the
      "Poodle Dog" restaurant, who, I regret to say, were not puritanically
      reserved or conventual in manner.
    
    
      But an unexpected circumstance presently changed and divided our interest.
      It was alleged by Clay, the assistant editor, that entering the restaurant
      one evening he saw the back and tails of a coat that seemed familiar to
      him half-filling a doorway leading to the restaurant kitchen. It was
      unmistakably the figure of one of our Club members,&mdash;the young
      lawyer,&mdash;Jack Manners. But what was he doing there? While the Editor
      was still gazing after him, he suddenly disappeared, as if some one had
      warned him that he was observed. As he did not reappear, when Tournelli
      entered from the kitchen a few moments later, the Editor called him and
      asked for his fellow-member. To his surprise the Italian answered, with
      every appearance of truthfulness, that he had not seen Mr. Manners at all!
      The Editor was staggered; but as he chanced, some hours later, to meet
      Manners, he playfully rallied him on his mysterious conference with the
      Italian. Manners replied briefly that he had had no interview whatever
      with Tournelli, and changed the subject quickly. The mystery&mdash;as we
      persisted in believing it&mdash;was heightened when another member deposed
      that he had seen "Tom," the Western waiter, coming from Manners's office.
      As Manners had volunteered no information of this, we felt that we could
      not without indelicacy ask him if Tom was a client, or a messenger from
      Tournelli. The only result was that our Club dinner was even more
      constrained than before. Not only was "Tom" now invested with a dark
      importance, but it was evident that the harmony of the Club was destroyed
      by these singular secret relations of two of its members with their
      employes.
    
    
      It chanced that one morning, arriving from a delayed journey, I dropped
      into the restaurant. It was that slack hour between the lingering
      breakfast and coming luncheon when the tables are partly stripped and
      unknown doors, opened for ventilation, reveal the distant kitchen, and a
      mingled flavor of cold coffee-grounds and lukewarm soups hangs heavy on
      the air. To this cheerlessness was added a gusty rain without, that filmed
      the panes of the windows and doors, and veiled from the passer-by the
      usual tempting display of snowy cloths and china.
    
    
      As I seemed to be the only customer at that hour, I selected a table by
      the window for distraction. Tom had taken my order; the other waiters,
      including Tournelli, were absent, with the exception of a solitary German,
      who, in the interlude of perfunctory trifling with the casters, gazed at
      me with that abstracted irresponsibility which one waiter assumes towards
      another's customer. Even the proprietor had deserted his desk at the
      counter. It seemed to be a favorable opportunity to get some information
      from Tom.
    
    
      But he anticipated me. When he had dealt a certain number of dishes around
      me, as if they were cards and he was telling my fortune, he leaned over
      the table and said, with interrogating confidence:&mdash;
    
    
      "I reckon you call that Mr. Manners of yours a good lawyer?"
    
    
      We were very loyal to each other in the Club, and I replied with youthful
      enthusiasm that he was considered one of the most promising at the bar.
      And, remembering Tournelli, I added confidently that whoever engaged him
      to look after their property interests had secured a treasure.
    
    
      "But is he good in criminal cases&mdash;before a police court, for
      instance?" continued Tom.
    
    
      I believed&mdash;I don't know on what grounds&mdash;that Manners was good
      in insurance and admiralty law, and that he looked upon criminal practice
      as low; but I answered briskly&mdash;though a trifle startled&mdash;that
      as a criminal lawyer he was perfect.
    
    
      "He could advise a man, who had a row hanging on, how to steer clear of
      being up for murder&mdash;eh?"
    
    
      I trusted, with a desperate attempt at jocosity, that neither he nor
      Tournelli had been doing anything to require Manners's services in that
      way.
    
    
      "It would be too late, THEN," said Tom, coolly, "and ANYBODY could tell a
      man what he ought to have done, or how to make the best of what he had
      done; but the smart thing in a lawyer would be to give a chap points
      BEFOREHAND, and sorter tell him how far he could go, and yet keep inside
      the law. How he might goad a fellow to draw on him, and then plug him&mdash;eh?"
    
    
      I looked up quickly. There was nothing in his ordinary, good-humored, but
      not very strong face to suggest that he himself was the subject of this
      hypothetical case. If he were speaking for Tournelli, the Italian
      certainly was not to be congratulated on his ambassador's prudence; and,
      above all, Manners was to be warned of the interpretation which might be
      put upon his counsels, and disseminated thus publicly. As I was thinking
      what to say, he moved away, but suddenly returned again.
    
    
      "What made you think Tournelli had been up to anything?" he asked sharply.
    
    
      "Nothing," I answered; "I only thought you and he, being friends"&mdash;
    
    
      "You mean we're both waiters in the same restaurant. Well, I don't know
      him any better than I know that chap over there," pointing to the other
      waiter. "He's a Greaser or an Italian, and, I reckon, goes with his kind."
    
    
      Why had we not thought of this before? Nothing would be more natural than
      that the rich and imperious Tournelli should be exclusive, and have no
      confidences with his enforced associates. And it was evident that Tom had
      noticed it and was jealous.
    
    
      "I suppose he's rather a swell, isn't he?" I suggested tentatively.
    
    
      A faint smile passed over Tom's face. It was partly cynical and partly
      suggestive of that amused toleration of our youthful credulity which
      seemed to be a part of that discomposing patronage that everybody extended
      to the Club. As he said nothing, I continued encouragingly:&mdash;
    
    
      "Because a man's a waiter, it doesn't follow that he's always been one, or
      always will be."
    
    
      "No," said Tom, abstractedly; "but it's about as good as anything else to
      lie low and wait on." But here two customers entered, and he turned to
      them, leaving me in doubt whether to accept this as a verbal pleasantry or
      an admission. Only one thing seemed plain: I had certainly gained no
      information, and only added a darker mystery to his conference with
      Manners, which I determined I should ask Manners to explain.
    
    
      I finished my meal in solitude. The rain was still beating drearily
      against the windows with an occasional accession of impulse that seemed
      like human impatience. Vague figures under dripping umbrellas, that hid
      their faces as if in premeditated disguise, hurried from the main
      thoroughfare. A woman in a hooded waterproof like a domino, a Mexican in a
      black serape, might have been stage conspirators hastening to a
      rendezvous. The cavernous chill and odor which I had before noted as
      coming from some sarcophagus of larder or oven, where "funeral baked
      meats" might have been kept in stock, began to oppress me. The hollow and
      fictitious domesticity of this common board had never before seemed so
      hopelessly displayed. And Tom, the waiter, his napkin twisted in his hand
      and his face turned with a sudden dark abstraction towards the window,
      appeared to be really "lying low," and waiting for something outside his
      avocation.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II.
    
    
      The fact that Tom did not happen to be on duty at the next Club dinner
      gave me an opportunity to repeat his mysterious remark to Manners, and to
      jokingly warn that rising young lawyer against the indiscretion of vague
      counsel. Manners, however, only shrugged his shoulders. "I don't know what
      he meant," he said carelessly; "but since he chooses to talk of his own
      affairs publicly, I don't mind saying that they are neither very weighty
      nor very dangerous. It's only the old story: the usual matrimonial
      infidelities that are mixed up with the Californian emigration. He leaves
      the regular wife behind,&mdash;fairly or unfairly, I can't say. She gets
      tired waiting, after the usual style, and elopes with somebody else. The
      Western Penelope isn't built for waiting. But she seems to have converted
      some of his property into cash when she skipped from St. Louis, and that's
      where his chief concern comes in. That's what he wanted to see me for;
      that's why he inveigled me into that infernal pantry of his one day to
      show me a plan of his property, as if that was any good."
    
    
      He paused disgustedly. We all felt, I think, that Tom was some kind of an
      impostor, claiming the sympathies of the Club on false pretenses.
      Nevertheless, the Quartermaster said, "Then you didn't do anything for him&mdash;give
      him any advice, eh?"
    
    
      "No; for the property's as much hers as his, and he hasn't got a divorce;
      and, as it's doubtful whether he didn't desert her first, he can't get
      one. He was surprised," he added, with a grim smile, "when I told him that
      he was obliged to support her, and was even liable for her debts. But
      people who are always talking of invoking the law know nothing about it."
      We were surprised too, although Manners was always convincing us, in some
      cheerful but discomposing way, that we were all daily and hourly, in our
      simplest acts, making ourself responsible for all sorts of liabilities and
      actions, and even generally preparing ourselves for arrest and
      imprisonment. The Quartermaster continued lazily:&mdash;
    
    
      "Then you didn't give him any points about shooting?"
    
    
      "No; he doesn't even know the man she went off with. It was eighteen
      months ago, and I don't believe he'd even know her again if he met her.
      But, if he isn't much of a client, we shall miss him to-night as a waiter,
      for the place is getting full, and there are not enough to serve."
    
    
      The restaurant was, indeed, unusually crowded that evening; the more so
      that, the private rooms above being early occupied, some dinner parties
      and exclusive couples had been obliged to content themselves with the
      public dining saloon. A small table nearest us, usually left vacant to
      insure a certain seclusion to the Club, was arranged, with a deprecatory
      apology from the proprietor, for one of those couples, a man and woman.
      The man was a well-known speculator,&mdash;cool, yet reckless and
      pleasure-loving; the woman, good-looking, picturesquely attractive,
      self-conscious, and self-possessed. Our propinquity was evidently neither
      novel nor discomposing. As she settled her skirts in her place, her
      bright, dark eyes swept our table with a frank, almost childish,
      familiarity. The younger members of the Club quite unconsciously pulled up
      their collars and settled their neckties; the elders as unconsciously
      raised their voices slightly, and somewhat arranged their sentences. Alas!
      the simplicity and unaffectedness of the Club were again invaded.
    
    
      Suddenly there was a crash, the breaking of glass, and an exclamation.
      Tournelli, no doubt disorganized by the unusual hurry, on his way to our
      table had dropped his tray, impartially distributed a plate of asparagus
      over an adjoining table, and, flushed and nervous, yet with an affectation
      of studied calmness, was pouring the sauce into the young Quartermaster's
      plate, in spite of his languid protests. At any other time we would have
      laughed, but there was something in the exaggerated agitation of the
      Italian that checked our mirth. Why should he be so upset by a trifling
      accident? He could afford to pay for the breakage; he would laugh at
      dismissal. Was it the sensitiveness of a refined nature, or&mdash;he was
      young and good-looking&mdash;was he disconcerted by the fact that our
      handsome neighbor had witnessed his awkwardness? But she was not laughing,
      and, as far as I could see, was intently regarding the bill of fare.
    
    
      "Waiter!" called her companion, hailing Tournelli. "Here!" The Italian,
      with a face now distinctly white, leaned over the table, adjusting the
      glasses, but did not reply.
    
    
      "Waiter!" repeated the stranger, sharply. Tournelli's face twitched, then
      became set as a mask; but he did not move. The stranger leaned forward and
      pulled his apron from behind. Tournelli started with flashing eyes, and
      turned swiftly round. But the Quartermaster's hand had closed on his
      wrist.
    
    
      "That's my knife, Tournelli."
    
    
      The knife dropped from the Italian's fingers.
    
    
      "Better see WHAT he wants. It may not be THAT," said the young officer,
      coolly but kindly.
    
    
      Tournelli turned impatiently towards the stranger. We alone had witnessed
      this incident, and were watching him breathlessly. Yet what bade fair a
      moment ago to be a tragedy, seemed now to halt grotesquely. For Tournelli,
      throwing open his linen jacket with a melodramatic gesture, tapped his
      breast, and with flashing eyes and suppressed accents said, "Sare; you
      wantah me? Look&mdash;I am herre!"
    
    
      The speculator leaned back in his chair in good-humored astonishment. The
      lady's black eyes, without looking at Tournelli, glanced backward round
      the room, and slipped along our table, with half-defiant unconcern; and
      then she uttered a short hysterical laugh.
    
    
      "Ah! ze lady&mdash;madame&mdash;ze signora&mdash;eh&mdash;she wantah me?"
      continued Tournelli, leaning on the table with compressed fingers, and
      glaring at her. "Perhaps SHE wantah Tournelli&mdash;eh?"
    
    
      "Well, you might bring some with the soup," blandly replied her escort,
      who seemed to enjoy the Italian's excitement as a national eccentricity;
      "but hurry up and set the table, will you?"
    
    
      Then followed, on the authority of the Editor, who understood Italian, a
      singular scene. Secure, apparently, in his belief that his language was
      generally uncomprehended, Tournelli brought a decanter, and, setting it on
      the table, said, "Traitress!" in an intense whisper. This was followed by
      the cruets, which he put down with the exclamation, "Perjured fiend!" Two
      glasses, placed on either side of her, carried the word "Apostate!" to her
      ear; and three knives and forks, rattling more than was necessary, and
      laid crosswise before her plate, were accompanied with "Tremble, wanton!"
      Then, as he pulled the tablecloth straight, and ostentatiously concealed a
      wine-stain with a clean napkin, scarcely whiter than his lips, he
      articulated under his breath: "Let him beware! he goes not hence alive! I
      will slice his craven heart&mdash;thus&mdash;and thou shalt see it." He
      turned quickly to a side table and brought back a spoon. "And THIS is why
      I have not found you;" another spoon, "For THIS you have disappeared;" a
      purely perfunctory polishing of her fork, "For HIM, bah!" an equally
      unnecessary wiping of her glass, "Blood of God!"&mdash;more wiping&mdash;"It
      will end! Yes"&mdash;general wiping and a final flourish over the whole
      table with a napkin&mdash;"I go, but at the door I shall await you both."
    
    
      She had not spoken yet, nor even lifted her eyes. When she did so,
      however, she raised them level with his, showed all her white teeth&mdash;they
      were small and cruel-looking&mdash;and said smilingly in his own dialect:&mdash;
    
    
      "Thief!"
    
    
      Tournelli halted, rigid.
    
    
      "You're talking his lingo, eh?" said her escort good-humoredly.
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      "Well&mdash;tell him to bustle around and be a little livelier with the
      dinner, won't you? This is only skirmishing."
    
    
      "You hear," she continued to Tournelli in a perfectly even voice; "or
      shall it be a policeman, and a charge of stealing?"
    
    
      "Stealing!" gasped Tournelli. "YOU say stealing!"
    
    
      "Yes&mdash;ten thousand dollars. You are well disguised here, my little
      fellow; it is a good business&mdash;yours. Keep it while you can."
    
    
      I think he would have sprung upon her there and then, but that the
      Quartermaster, who was nearest him, and had been intently watching his
      face, made a scarcely perceptible movement as if ready to anticipate him.
      He caught the officer's eye; caught, I think, in ours the revelation that
      he had been understood, drew back with a sidelong, sinuous movement, and
      disappeared in the passage to the kitchen.
    
    
      I believe we all breathed more freely, although the situation was still
      full enough of impending possibilities to prevent peaceful enjoyment of
      our dinner. As the Editor finished his hurried translation, it was
      suggested that we ought to warn the unsuspecting escort of Tournelli's
      threats. But it was pointed out that this would be betraying the woman,
      and that Jo Hays (her companion) was fully able to take care of himself.
      "Besides," said the Editor, aggrievedly, "you fellows only think of
      YOURSELVES, and you don't understand the first principles of journalism.
      Do you suppose I'm going to do anything to spoil a half-column of leaded
      brevier copy&mdash;from an eye-witness, too? No; it's a square enough
      fight as it stands. We must look out for the woman, and not let Tournelli
      get an unfair drop on Hays. That is, if the whole thing isn't a bluff."
    
    
      But the Italian did not return. Whether he had incontinently fled, or was
      nursing his wrath in the kitchen, or already fulfilling his threat of
      waiting on the pavement outside the restaurant, we could not guess.
      Another waiter appeared with the dinners they had ordered. A momentary
      thrill of excitement passed over us at the possibility that Tournelli had
      poisoned their soup; but it presently lapsed, as we saw the couple
      partaking of it comfortably, and chatting with apparent unconcern. Was the
      scene we had just witnessed only a piece of Southern exaggeration? Was the
      woman a creature devoid of nerves or feeling of any kind; or was she
      simply a consummate actress? Yet she was clearly not acting, for in the
      intervals of conversation, and even while talking, her dark eyes wandered
      carelessly around the room, with the easy self-confidence of a pretty
      woman. We were beginning to talk of something else, when the Editor said
      suddenly, in a suppressed voice:
    
    
      "Hullo! What's the matter now?"
    
    
      The woman had risen, and was hurriedly throwing her cloak over her
      shoulders. But it was HER face that was now ashen and agitated, and we
      could see that her hands were trembling. Her escort was assisting her, but
      was evidently as astonished as ourselves. "Perhaps," he suggested
      hopefully, "if you wait a minute it will pass off."
    
    
      "No, no," she gasped, still hurriedly wrestling with her cloak. "Don't you
      see I'm suffocating here&mdash;I want air. You can follow!" She began to
      move off, her face turned fixedly in the direction of the door. We
      instinctively looked there&mdash;perhaps for Tournelli. There was no one.
      Nevertheless, the Editor and Quartermaster had half-risen from their
      seats.
    
    
      "Helloo!" said Manners suddenly. "There's Tom just come in. Call him!"
    
    
      Tom, evidently recalled from his brief furlough by the proprietor on
      account of the press of custom, had just made his appearance from the
      kitchen.
    
    
      "Tom, where's Tournelli?" asked the Lawyer hurriedly, but following the
      retreating woman with his eyes.
    
    
      "Skipped, they say. Somebody insulted him," said Tom curtly.
    
    
      "You didn't see him hanging round outside, eh? Swearing vengeance?" asked
      the Editor.
    
    
      "No," said Tom scornfully.
    
    
      The woman had reached the door, and darted out of it as her escort paused
      a moment at the counter to throw down a coin. Yet in that moment she had
      hurried before him through the passage into the street. I turned
      breathlessly to the window. For an instant her face, white as a phantom's,
      appeared pressed rigidly against the heavy plate-glass, her eyes staring
      with a horrible fascination back into the room&mdash;I even imagined at
      us. Perhaps, as it was evident that Tournelli was not with her, she
      fancied he was still here; perhaps she had mistaken Tom for him! However,
      her escort quickly rejoined her; their shadows passed the window together&mdash;they
      were gone.
    
    
      Then a pistol-shot broke the quiet of the street.
    
    
      The Editor and Quartermaster rose and ran to the door. Manners rose also,
      but lingered long enough to whisper to me, "Don't lose sight of Tom," and
      followed them. But to my momentary surprise no one else moved. I had
      forgotten, in the previous excitement, that in those days a pistol-shot
      was not unusual enough to attract attention. A few raised their heads at
      the sound of running feet on the pavement, and the flitting of black
      shadows past the windows. Tom had not stirred, but, napkin in hand, and
      eyes fixed on vacancy, was standing, as I had seen him once before, in an
      attitude of listless expectation.
    
    
      In a few minutes Manners returned. I thought he glanced oddly at Tom, who
      was still lingering in attendance, and I even fancied he talked to us
      ostentatiously for his benefit. "Yes, it was a row of Tournelli's. He was
      waiting at the corner; had rushed at Hays with a knife, but had been met
      with a derringer-shot through his hat. The lady, who, it seems, was only a
      chance steamer acquaintance of Hays', thought the attack must have been
      meant for HER, as she had recognized in the Italian a man who had stolen
      from her divorced husband in the States, two years ago, and was a fugitive
      from justice. At least that was the explanation given by Hays, for the
      woman had fainted and been driven off to her hotel by the Quartermaster,
      and Tournelli had escaped. But the Editor was on his track. You didn't
      notice that lady, Tom, did you?"
    
    
      Tom came out of an abstracted study, and said: "No, she had her back to me
      all the time."
    
    
      Manners regarded him steadily for a moment without speaking, but in a way
      that I could not help thinking was much more embarrassing to the
      bystanders than to him. When we rose to leave, as he placed his usual
      gratuity into Tom's hand, he said carelessly, "You might drop into my
      office to-morrow if you have anything to tell ME."
    
    
      "I haven't," said Tom quietly.
    
    
      "Then I may have something to tell YOU."
    
    
      Tom nodded, and turned away to his duties. The Mining Secretary and myself
      could scarcely wait to reach the street before we turned eagerly on
      Manners.
    
    
      "Well?"
    
    
      "Well; the woman you saw was Tom's runaway wife, and Tournelli the man she
      ran away with."
    
    
      "And Tom knew it?"
    
    
      "Can't say."
    
    
      "And you mean to say that all this while Tom never suspected HIM, and even
      did not recognize HER just now?"
    
    
      Manners lifted his hat and passed his fingers through his hair
      meditatively. "Ask me something easier, gentlemen."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      A TREASURE OF THE GALLEON.
    
    
      Her father's house was nearly a mile from the sea, but the breath of it
      was always strong at the windows and doors in the early morning, and when
      there were heavy "southwesters" blowing in the winter, the wind brought
      the sharp sting of sand to her cheek, and the rain an odd taste of salt to
      her lips. On this particular December afternoon, however, as she stood in
      the doorway, it seemed to be singularly calm; the southwest trades blew
      but faintly, and scarcely broke the crests of the long Pacific swell that
      lazily rose and fell on the beach, which only a slanting copse of
      scrub-oak and willow hid from the cottage. Nevertheless, she knew this
      league-long strip of shining sand much better, it is to be feared, than
      the scanty flower-garden, arid and stunted by its contiguity. It had been
      her playground when she first came there, a motherless girl of twelve, and
      she had helped her father gather its scattered driftwood&mdash;as the
      fortunes of the Millers were not above accepting these occasional
      offerings of their lordly neighbor.
    
    
      "I wouldn't go far to-day, Jenny," said her father, as the girl stepped
      from the threshold. "I don't trust the weather at this season; and besides
      you had better be looking over your wardrobe for the Christmas Eve party
      at Sol. Catlin's."
    
    
      "Why, father, you don't intend to go to that man's?" said the girl,
      looking up with a troubled face.
    
    
      "Lawyer Miller," as he was called by his few neighbors, looked slightly
      embarrassed. "Why not?" he asked in a faintly irritated tone.
    
    
      "Why not? Why, father, you know how vulgar and conceited he is,&mdash;how
      everybody here truckles to him!"
    
    
      "Very likely; he's a very superior man of his kind,&mdash;a kind they
      understand here, too,&mdash;a great trapper, hunter, and pioneer."
    
    
      "But I don't believe in his trapping, hunting, and pioneering," said the
      girl, petulantly. "I believe it's all as hollow and boisterous as himself.
      It's no more real, or what one thinks it should be, than he is. And he
      dares to patronize you&mdash;you, father, an educated man and a
      gentleman!"
    
    
      "Say rather an unsuccessful lawyer who was fool enough to believe that
      buying a ranch could make him a farmer," returned her father, but half
      jestingly. "I only wish I was as good at my trade as he is."
    
    
      "But you never liked him,&mdash;you always used to ignore him; you've
      changed, father"&mdash;She stopped suddenly, for her recollection of her
      father's quiet superiority and easy independence when he first came there
      was in such marked contrast to his late careless and weak concession to
      the rude life around them, that she felt a pang of vague degradation,
      which she feared her voice might betray.
    
    
      "Very well! Do as you like," he replied, with affected carelessness; "only
      I thought, as we cannot afford to go elsewhere this Christmas, it might be
      well for us to take what we could find here."
    
    
      "Take what we could find here!" It was so unlike him&mdash;he who had
      always been so strong in preserving their little domestic refinements in
      their rude surroundings, that their poverty had never seemed mean, nor
      their seclusion ignoble. She turned away to conceal her indignant color.
      She could share the household work with a squaw and Chinaman, she could
      fetch wood and water. Catlin had patronizingly seen her doing it, but to
      dance to his vulgar piping&mdash;never!
    
    
      She was not long in reaching the sands that now lay before her, warm,
      sweet-scented from short beach grass, stretching to a dim rocky
      promontory, and absolutely untrod by any foot but her own. It was this
      virginity of seclusion that had been charming to her girlhood; fenced in
      between the impenetrable hedge of scrub-oaks on the one side, and the
      lifting green walls of breakers tipped with chevaux de frise of white foam
      on the other, she had known a perfect security for her sports and fancies
      that had captivated her town-bred instincts and native fastidiousness. A
      few white-winged sea-birds, as proud, reserved, and maiden-like as
      herself, had been her only companions. And it was now the custodian of her
      secret,&mdash;a secret as innocent and childlike as her previous youthful
      fancies,&mdash;but still a secret known only to herself.
    
    
      One day she had come upon the rotting ribs of a wreck on the beach. Its
      distance from the tide line, its position, and its deep imbedding of sand,
      showed that it was of ancient origin. An omnivorous reader of all that
      pertained to the history of California, Jenny had in fancy often sailed
      the seas in one of those mysterious treasure-ships that had skirted the
      coast in bygone days, and she at once settled in her mind that her
      discovery was none other than a castaway Philippine galleon. Partly from
      her reserve, and partly from a suddenly conceived plan, she determined to
      keep its existence unknown to her father, as careful inquiry on her part
      had found it was equally unknown to the neighbors. For this shy,
      imaginative young girl of eighteen had convinced herself that it might
      still contain a part of its old treasure. She would dig for it herself,
      without telling anybody. If she failed, no one would know it; if she were
      successful, she would surprise her father and perhaps retrieve their
      fortune by less vulgar means than their present toil. Thanks to the
      secluded locality and the fact that she was known to spend her leisure
      moments in wandering there, she could work without suspicion. Secretly
      conveying a shovel and a few tools to the spot the next day, she set about
      her prodigious task. As the upper works were gone, and the galleon not
      large, in three weeks, working an hour or two each day, she had made a
      deep excavation in the stern. She had found many curious things,&mdash;the
      flotsam and jetsam of previous storms,&mdash;but as yet, it is perhaps
      needless to say, not the treasure.
    
    
      To-day she was filled with the vague hope of making her discovery before
      Christmas Day. To have been able to take her father something on that day&mdash;if
      only a few old coins&mdash;the fruit of her own unsuspected labor and
      intuition&mdash;not the result of vulgar barter or menial wage&mdash;would
      have been complete happiness. It was perhaps a somewhat visionary
      expectation for an educated girl of eighteen, but I am writing of a young
      Californian girl, who had lived in the fierce glamour of treasure-hunting,
      and in whose sensitive individuality some of its subtle poison had been
      instilled. Howbeit, to-day she found nothing. She was sadly hiding her
      pick and shovel, as was her custom, when she discovered the fresh track of
      an alien foot in the sand. Robinson Crusoe was not more astounded at the
      savage footprint than Jenny Miller at this damning proof of the invasion
      of her sacred territory. The footprints came from and returned to the
      copse of shrubs. Some one might have seen her at work!
    
    
      But a singular change in the weather, overlooked in her excitement, here
      forced itself upon her. A light film over sea and sky, lifted only by
      fitful gusts of wind, seemed to have suddenly thickened until it became an
      opaque vault, narrowing in circumference as the wind increased. The
      promontory behind her disappeared, as if swallowed up, the distance before
      her seemed to contract; the ocean at her side, the color of dull pewter,
      vanished in a sheet of slanting rain, and by the time she reached the
      house, half running, half carried along by the quartering force of the
      wind, a full gale was blowing.
    
    
      It blew all the evening, reaching a climax and fury at past midnight that
      was remembered for many years along that coast. In the midst of it they
      heard the booming of cannon, and then the voices of neighbors in the road.
      "There was," said the voices, "a big steamer ashore just afore the house."
      They dressed quickly and ran out.
    
    
      Hugging the edge of the copse to breathe and evade the fury of the wind,
      they struggled to the sands. At first, looking out to sea, the girl saw
      nothing but foam. But, following the direction of a neighbor's arm, for in
      that wild tumult man alone seemed speechless, she saw directly before her,
      so close upon her that she could have thrown a pebble on board, the high
      bows of a ship. Indeed, its very nearness gave her the feeling that it was
      already saved, and its occasional heavy roll to leeward, drunken,
      helpless, ludicrous, but never awful, brought a hysteric laugh to her
      lips. But when a livid blue light, lit in the swinging top, showed a
      number of black objects clinging to bulwarks and rigging, and the sea,
      with languid, heavy cruelty, pushing rather than beating them away, one by
      one, she knew that Death was there.
    
    
      The neighbors, her father with the others, had been running hopelessly to
      and fro, or cowering in groups against the copse, when suddenly they
      uttered a cry&mdash;their first&mdash;of joyful welcome. And with that
      shout, the man she most despised and hated, Sol. Catlin, mounted on a
      "calico" mustang, as outrageous and bizarre as himself, dashed among them.
    
    
      In another moment, what had been fear, bewilderment, and hesitation was
      changed to courage, confidence, and action. The men pressed eagerly around
      him, and as eagerly dispersed under his quick command. Galloping at his
      heels was a team with the whale-boat, brought from the river, miles away.
      He was here, there, and everywhere; catching the line thrown by the rocket
      from the ship, marshaling the men to haul it in, answering the hail from
      those on board above the tempest, pervading everything and everybody with
      the fury of the storm; loud, imperious, domineering, self-asserting,
      all-sufficient, and successful! And when the boat was launched, the last
      mighty impulse came from his shoulder. He rode at the helm into the first
      hanging wall of foam, erect and triumphant! Dazzled, bewildered, crying
      and laughing, she hated him more than ever.
    
    
      The boat made three trips, bringing off, with the aid of the hawser, all
      but the sailors she had seen perish before her own eyes. The passengers,&mdash;they
      were few,&mdash;the captain and officers, found refuge in her father's
      house, and were loud in their praises of Sol. Catlin. But in that grateful
      chorus a single gloomy voice arose, the voice of a wealthy and troubled
      passenger. "I will give," he said, "five thousand dollars to the man who
      brings me a box of securities I left in my stateroom." Every eye turned
      instinctively to Sol.; he answered only those of Jenny's. "Say ten
      thousand, and if the dod-blasted hulk holds together two hours longer I'll
      do it, d&mdash;n me! You hear me! My name's Sol. Catlin, and when I say a
      thing, by G-d, I do it." Jenny's disgust here reached its climax. The hero
      of a night of undoubted energy and courage had blotted it out in a single
      moment of native vanity and vulgar avarice.
    
    
      He was gone; not only two hours, but daylight had come and they were
      eagerly seeking him, when he returned among them, dripping and&mdash;empty-handed.
      He had reached the ship, he said, with another; found the box, and trusted
      himself alone with it to the sea. But in the surf he had to abandon it to
      save himself. It had perhaps drifted ashore, and might be found; for
      himself, he abandoned his claim to the reward. Had he looked abashed or
      mortified, Jenny felt that she might have relented, but the braggart was
      as all-satisfied, as confident and boastful as ever. Nevertheless, as his
      eye seemed to seek hers, she was constrained, in mere politeness, to add
      her own to her father's condolences. "I suppose," she hesitated, in
      passing him, "that this is a mere nothing to you after all that you did
      last night that was really great and unselfish."
    
    
      "Were you never disappointed, Miss?" he said, with exasperating
      abruptness.
    
    
      A quick consciousness of her own thankless labor on the galleon, and a
      terrible idea that he might have some suspicion of, and perhaps the least
      suggestion that she might have been disappointed in him, brought a faint
      color to her cheek. But she replied with dignity:&mdash;
    
    
      "I really couldn't say. But certainly," she added, with a new-found
      pertness, "you don't look it."
    
    
      "Nor do you, Miss," was his idiotic answer.
    
    
      A few hours later, alarmed at what she had heard of the inroads of the
      sea, which had risen higher than ever known to the oldest settler, and
      perhaps mindful of yesterday's footprints, she sought her old secluded
      haunt. The wreck was still there, but the sea had reached it. The
      excavation between its gaunt ribs was filled with drift and the seaweed
      carried there by the surges and entrapped in its meshes. And there, too,
      caught as in a net, lay the wooden box of securities Sol. Catlin had
      abandoned to the sea.
    
    
      This is the story as it was told to me. The singularity of coincidences
      has challenged some speculation. Jenny insisted at the time upon sharing
      the full reward with Catlin, but local critics have pointed out that from
      subsequent events this proved nothing. For she had married him!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      OUT OF A PIONEER'S TRUNK.
    
    
      It was a slightly cynical, but fairly good-humored crowd that had gathered
      before a warehouse on Long Wharf in San Francisco one afternoon in the
      summer of '51. Although the occasion was an auction, the bidders' chances
      more than usually hazardous, and the season and locality famous for
      reckless speculation, there was scarcely any excitement among the
      bystanders, and a lazy, half-humorous curiosity seemed to have taken the
      place of any zeal for gain.
    
    
      It was an auction of unclaimed trunks and boxes&mdash;the personal luggage
      of early emigrants&mdash;which had been left on storage in hulk or
      warehouse at San Francisco, while the owner was seeking his fortune in the
      mines. The difficulty and expense of transport, often obliging the
      gold-seeker to make part of his journey on foot, restricted him to the
      smallest impedimenta, and that of a kind not often found in the luggage of
      ordinary civilization. As a consequence, during the emigration of '49, he
      was apt on landing to avail himself of the invitation usually displayed on
      some of the doors of the rude hostelries on the shore: "Rest for the Weary
      and Storage for Trunks." In a majority of cases he never returned to claim
      his stored property. Enforced absence, protracted equally by good or evil
      fortune, accumulated the high storage charges until they usually far
      exceeded the actual value of the goods; sickness, further emigration, or
      death also reduced the number of possible claimants, and that more
      wonderful human frailty&mdash;absolute forgetfulness of deposited
      possessions&mdash;combined together to leave the bulk of the property in
      the custodian's hands. Under an understood agreement they were always sold
      at public auction after a given time. Although the contents of some of the
      trunks were exposed, it was found more in keeping with the public
      sentiment to sell the trunks LOCKED and UNOPENED. The element of curiosity
      was kept up from time to time by the incautious disclosures of the lucky
      or unlucky purchaser, and general bidding thus encouraged&mdash;except
      when the speculator, with the true gambling instinct, gave no indication
      in his face of what was drawn in this lottery. Generally, however, some
      suggestion in the exterior of the trunk, a label or initials; some
      conjectural knowledge of its former owner, or the idea that he might be
      secretly present in the hope of getting his property back for less than
      the accumulated dues, kept up the bidding and interest.
    
    
      A modest-looking, well-worn portmanteau had been just put up at a small
      opening bid, when Harry Flint joined the crowd. The young man had arrived
      a week before at San Francisco friendless and penniless, and had been
      forced to part with his own effects to procure necessary food and lodging
      while looking for an employment. In the irony of fate that morning the
      proprietors of a dry-goods store, struck with his good looks and manners,
      had offered him a situation, if he could make himself more presentable to
      their fair clients. Harry Flint was gazing half abstractedly, half
      hopelessly, at the portmanteau without noticing the auctioneer's
      persuasive challenge. In his abstraction he was not aware that the
      auctioneer's assistant was also looking at him curiously, and that
      possibly his dejected and half-clad appearance had excited the attention
      of one of the cynical bystanders, who was exchanging a few words with the
      assistant. He was, however, recalled to himself a moment later when the
      portmanteau was knocked down at fifteen dollars, and considerably startled
      when the assistant placed it at his feet with a grim smile. "That's your
      property, Fowler, and I reckon you look as if you wanted it back bad."
    
    
      "But&mdash;there's some mistake," stammered Flint. "I didn't bid."
    
    
      "No, but Tom Flynn did for you. You see, I spotted you from the first, and
      told Flynn I reckoned you were one of those chaps who came back from the
      mines dead broke. And he up and bought your things for you&mdash;like a
      square man. That's Flynn's style, if he is a gambler."
    
    
      "But," persisted Flint, "this never was my property. My name isn't Fowler,
      and I never left anything here."
    
    
      The assistant looked at him with a grim, half-credulous, half-scornful
      smile. "Have it your own way," he said, "but I oughter tell ye, old man,
      that I'm the warehouse clerk, and I remember YOU. I'm here for that
      purpose. But as that thar valise is bought and paid for by somebody else
      and given to you, it's nothing more to me. Take it or leave it."
    
    
      The ridiculousness of quarreling over the mere form of his good fortune
      here struck Flint, and, as his abrupt benefactor had as abruptly
      disappeared, he hurried off with his prize. Reaching his cheap
      lodging-house, he examined its contents. As he had surmised, it contained
      a full suit of clothing of the better sort, and suitable to his urban
      needs. There were a few articles of jewelry, which he put religiously
      aside. There were some letters, which seemed to be of a purely business
      character. There were a few daguerreotypes of pretty faces, one of which
      was singularly fascinating to him. But there was another, of a young man,
      which startled him with its marvelous resemblance to HIMSELF! In a flash
      of intelligence he understood it all now. It was the likeness of the
      former owner of the trunk, for whom the assistant had actually mistaken
      him! He glanced hurriedly at the envelopes of the letters. They were
      addressed to Shelby Fowler, the name by which the assistant had just
      called him. The mystery was plain now. And for the present he could fairly
      accept his good luck, and trust to later fortune to justify himself.
    
    
      Transformed in his new garb, he left his lodgings to present himself once
      more to his possible employer. His way led past one of the large gambling
      saloons. It was yet too early to find the dry-goods trader disengaged;
      perhaps the consciousness of more decent, civilized garb emboldened him to
      mingle more freely with strangers, and he entered the saloon. He was
      scarcely abreast of one of the faro tables when a man suddenly leaped up
      with an oath and discharged a revolver full in his face. The shot missed.
      Before his unknown assailant could fire again the astonished Flint had
      closed with him, and instinctively clutched the weapon. A brief but
      violent struggle ensued. Flint felt his strength failing him, when
      suddenly a look of astonishment came into the furious eyes of his
      adversary, and the man's grasp mechanically relaxed. The half-freed
      pistol, thrown upwards by this movement, was accidentally discharged point
      blank into his temples, and he fell dead. No one in the crowd had stirred
      or interfered.
    
    
      "You've done for Australian Pete this time, Mr. Fowler," said a voice at
      his elbow. He turned gaspingly and recognized his strange benefactor,
      Flynn. "I call you all to witness, gentlemen," continued the gambler,
      turning dictatorially to the crowd, "that this man was FIRST attacked and
      was UNARMED." He lifted Flint's limp and empty hands and then pointed to
      the dead man, who was still grasping the weapon. "Come!" He caught the
      half-paralyzed arm of Flint and dragged him into the street.
    
    
      "But," stammered the horrified Flint, as he was borne along, "what does it
      all mean? What made that man attack me?"
    
    
      "I reckon it was a case of shooting on sight, Mr. Fowler; but he missed it
      by not waiting to see if you were armed. It wasn't the square thing, and
      you're all right with the crowd now, whatever he might have had agin'
      you."
    
    
      "But," protested the unhappy Flint, "I never laid eyes on the man before,
      and my name isn't Fowler."
    
    
      Flynn halted, and dragged him in a door way. "Who the devil are you?" he
      asked roughly.
    
    
      Briefly, passionately, almost hysterically, Flint told him his scant
      story. An odd expression came over the gambler's face.
    
    
      "Look here," he said abruptly, "I have passed my word to the crowd yonder
      that you are a dead-broke miner called Fowler. I allowed that you might
      have had some row with that Sydney duck, Australian Pete, in the mines.
      That satisfied them. If I go back now, and say it's a lie, that your name
      ain't Fowler, and you never knew who Pete was, they'll jest pass you over
      to the police to deal with you, and wash their hands of it altogether. You
      may prove to the police who you are, and how that d&mdash;- clerk mistook
      you, but it will give you trouble. And who is there here who knows who you
      really are?"
    
    
      "No one," said Flint, with sudden hopelessness.
    
    
      "And you say you're an orphan, and ain't got any relations livin' that
      you're beholden to?"
    
    
      "No one."
    
    
      "Then, take my advice, and BE Fowler, and stick to it! Be Fowler until
      Fowler turns up, and thanks you for it; for you've saved Fowler's life, as
      Pete would never have funked and lost his grit over Fowler as he did with
      you; and you've a right to his name."
    
    
      He stopped, and the same odd, superstitious look came into his dark eyes.
    
    
      "Don't you see what all that means? Well, I'll tell you. You're in the
      biggest streak of luck a man ever had. You've got the cards in your own
      hand! They spell 'Fowler'! Play Fowler first, last, and all the time.
      Good-night, and good luck, MR. FOWLER."
    
    
      The next morning's journal contained an account of the justifiable killing
      of the notorious desperado and ex-convict, Australian Pete, by a
      courageous young miner by the name of Fowler. "An act of firmness and
      daring," said the "Pioneer," "which will go far to counteract the
      terrorism produced by those lawless ruffians."
    
    
      In his new suit of clothes, and with this paper in his hand, Flint sought
      the dry-goods proprietor&mdash;the latter was satisfied and convinced.
      That morning Harry Flint began his career as salesman and as "Shelby
      Fowler."
    
    
      From that day Shelby Fowler's career was one of uninterrupted prosperity.
      Within the year he became a partner. The same miraculous fortune followed
      other ventures later. He was mill owner, mine owner, bank director&mdash;a
      millionaire! He was popular, the reputation of his brief achievement over
      the desperado kept him secure from the attack of envy and rivalry. He
      never was confronted by the real Fowler. There was no danger of exposure
      by others&mdash;the one custodian of his secret, Tom Flynn, died in Nevada
      the year following. He had quite forgotten his youthful past, and even the
      more recent lucky portmanteau; remembered nothing, perhaps, but the pretty
      face of the daguerreotype that had fascinated him. There seemed to be no
      reason why he should not live and die as Shelby Fowler.
    
    
      His business a year later took him to Europe. He was entering a train at
      one of the great railway stations of London, when the porter, who had just
      deposited his portmanteau in a compartment, reappeared at the window
      followed by a young lady in mourning.
    
    
      "Beg pardon, sir, but I handed you the wrong portmanteau. That belongs to
      this young lady. This is yours."
    
    
      Flint glanced at the portmanteau on the seat before him. It certainly was
      not his, although it bore the initials "S. F." He was mechanically handing
      it back to the porter, when his eyes fell on the young lady's face. For an
      instant he stood petrified. It was the face of the daguerreotype. "I beg
      pardon," he stammered, "but are these your initials?" She hesitated,
      perhaps it was the abruptness of the question, but he saw she looked
      confused.
    
    
      "No. A friend's."
    
    
      She disappeared into another carriage, but from that moment Harry Flint
      knew that he had no other aim in life but to follow this clue and the
      beautiful girl who had dropped it. He bribed the guard at the next
      station, and discovered that she was going to York. On their arrival, he
      was ready on the platform to respectfully assist her. A few words
      disclosed the fact that she was a fellow-countrywoman, although residing
      in England, and at present on her way to join some friends at Harrogate.
      Her name was West. At the mention of his, he again fancied she looked
      disturbed.
    
    
      They met again and again; the informality of his introduction was
      overlooked by her friends, as his assumed name was already respectably and
      responsibly known beyond California. He thought no more of his future. He
      was in love. He even dared to think it might be returned; but he felt he
      had no right to seek that knowledge until he had told her his real name
      and how he came to assume another's. He did so alone&mdash;scarcely a
      month after their first meeting. To his alarm, she burst into a flood of
      tears, and showed an agitation that seemed far beyond any apparent cause.
      When she had partly recovered, she said, in a low, frightened voice:&mdash;
    
    
      "You are bearing MY BROTHER'S name. But it was a name that the unhappy boy
      had so shamefully disgraced in Australia that he abandoned it, and, as he
      lay upon his death-bed, the last act of his wasted life was to write an
      imploring letter begging me to change mine too. For the infamous companion
      of his crime who had first tempted, then betrayed him, had possession of
      all his papers and letters, many of them from ME, and was threatening to
      bring them to our Virginia home and expose him to our neighbors. Maddened
      by desperation, the miserable boy twice attempted the life of the
      scoundrel, and might have added that blood guiltiness to his other sins
      had he lived. I DID change my name to my mother's maiden one, left the
      country, and have lived here to escape the revelations of that desperado,
      should he fulfill his threat."
    
    
      In a flash of recollection Flint remembered the startled look that had
      come into his assailant's eye after they had clinched. It was the same man
      who had too late realized that his antagonist was not Fowler. "Thank God!
      you are forever safe from any exposure from that man," he said, gravely,
      "and the name of Fowler has never been known in San Francisco save in all
      respect and honor. It is for you to take back&mdash;fearlessly and alone!"
    
    
      She did&mdash;but not alone, for she shared it with her husband.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      THE GHOSTS OF STUKELEY CASTLE.
    
    
      There should have been snow on the ground to make the picture seasonable
      and complete, but the Western Barbarian had lived long enough in England
      to know that, except in the pages of a holiday supplement, this was rarely
      the accompaniment of a Christmas landscape, and he cheerfully accepted, on
      the 24th of December, the background of a low, brooding sky, on which the
      delicate tracery of leafless sprays and blacker chevaux de frise of pine
      was faintly etched, as a consistent setting to the turrets and peacefully
      stacked chimneys of Stukeley Castle. Yet, even in this disastrous eclipse
      of color and distance, the harmonious outlines of the long, gray,
      irregular pile seemed to him as wonderful as ever. It still dominated the
      whole landscape, and, as he had often fancied, carried this subjection
      even to the human beings who had created it, lived in it, but which it
      seemed to have in some dull, senile way dozed over and forgotten. He
      vividly recalled the previous sunshine of an autumnal house party within
      its walls, where some descendants of its old castellans, encountered in
      long galleries or at the very door of their bedrooms, looked as alien to
      the house as the Barbarian himself.
    
    
      For the rest it may be found described in the local guide-books, with a
      view of its "South Front," "West Front," and "Great Quadrangle." It was
      alleged to be based on an encampment of the Romans&mdash;that highly
      apocryphal race who seemed to have spent their time in getting up picnics
      on tessellated pavements, where, after hilariously emptying their pockets
      of their loose coin and throwing round their dishes, they instantly built
      a road to escape by, leaving no other record of their existence. Stow and
      Dugdale had recorded the date when a Norman favorite obtained the royal
      license to "embattle it;" it had done duty on Christmas cards with the
      questionable snow already referred to laid on thickly in crystal; it had
      been lovingly portrayed by a fair countrywoman&mdash;the vivacious
      correspondent of the "East Machias Sentinel"&mdash;in a combination of the
      most delightful feminine disregard of facts with the highest feminine
      respect for titles. It was rich in a real and spiritual estate of
      tapestries, paintings, armor, legends, and ghosts. Everything the poet
      could wish for, and indeed some things that decent prose might have
      possibly wished out of it, were there.
    
    
      Yet, from the day that it had been forcibly seized by a Parliamentary
      General, until more recently, when it had passed by the no less desperate
      conveyance of marriage into the hands of a Friendly Nobleman known to the
      Western Barbarian, it had been supposed to suggest something or other more
      remarkable than itself. "Few spectators," said the guide-book, "even the
      most unimpassioned, can stand in the courtyard and gaze upon those
      historic walls without feeling a thrill of awe," etc. The Western
      Barbarian had stood there, gazed, and felt no thrill. "The privileged
      guest," said the grave historian, "passing in review the lineaments of the
      illustrious owners of Stukeley, as he slowly paces the sombre gallery,
      must be conscious of emotions of no ordinary character," etc., etc. The
      Barbarian had been conscious of no such emotions. And it was for this
      reason, and believing he MIGHT experience them if left there in solitude,
      with no distracting or extraneous humanity around him, it had been agreed
      between him and the Friendly Nobleman, who had fine Barbarian instincts,
      that as he&mdash;the Friendly Nobleman&mdash;and his family were to spend
      their holidays abroad, the Barbarian should be allowed, on the eve and day
      of Christmas, to stay at Stukeley alone. "But," added his host, "you'll
      find it beastly lonely, and although I've told the housekeeper to look
      after you&mdash;you'd better go over to dine at Audley Friars, where
      there's a big party, and they know you, and it will be a deuced deal more
      amusing. And&mdash;er&mdash;I say&mdash;you know&mdash;you're really NOT
      looking out for ghosts, and that sort of thing, are you? You know you
      fellows don't believe in them&mdash;over there." And the Barbarian,
      assuring him that this was a part of his deficient emotions, it was
      settled then and there that he should come. And that was why, on the 24th
      of December, the Barbarian found himself gazing hopefully on the landscape
      with his portmanteau at his feet, as he drove up the avenue.
    
    
      The ravens did NOT croak ominously from the battlements as he entered. And
      the housekeeper, although neither "stately" nor "tall," nor full of
      reminiscences of "his late lordship, the present Earl's father," was very
      sensible and practical. The Barbarian could, of course, have his choice of
      rooms&mdash;but&mdash;she had thought&mdash;remembering his tastes the
      last time, that the long blue room? Exactly! The long, low-arched room,
      with the faded blue tapestry, looking upon the gallery&mdash;capital! He
      had always liked that room. From purely negative evidence he had every
      reason to believe that it was the one formidable-looking room in England
      that Queen Elizabeth had not slept in.
    
    
      When the footman had laid out his clothes, and his step grew fainter along
      the passage, until it was suddenly swallowed up with the closing of a red
      baize door in the turret staircase, like a trap in an oubliette, the whole
      building seemed to sink back into repose. Quiet it certainly was, but not
      more so, he remembered, than when the chambers on either side were filled
      with guests, and floating voices in the corridor were lost in those
      all-absorbing walls. So far, certainly, this was no new experience. It was
      past four. He waited for the shadows to gather. Light thickened beyond his
      windows; gradually the outflanking wall and part of a projecting terrace
      crumbled away in the darkness, as if Night were slowly reducing the
      castle. The figures on the tapestry in his room stood out faintly. The
      gallery, seen through his open door, barred with black spaces between the
      mullioned windows, presently became obliterated, as if invaded by a dull
      smoke from without. But nothing moved, nothing glimmered. Really this
      might become in time very stupid.
    
    
      He was startled, however, while dressing, to see from his windows that the
      great banqueting hall was illuminated, but on coming down was amused to
      find his dinner served on a small table in its oaken solitude lit by the
      large electric chandelier&mdash;for Stukeley Castle under its present lord
      had all the modern improvements&mdash;shining on the tattered banners and
      glancing mail above him. It was evidently the housekeeper's reading of
      some written suggestion of her noble master. The Barbarian, in a flash of
      instinct, imagined the passage:&mdash;
    
    
      "Humor him as a harmless lunatic; the plate is quite safe."
    
    
      Declining the further offer of an illumination of the picture gallery,
      grand drawing-room, ball-room, and chapel, a few hours later he found
      himself wandering in the corridor with a single candle and a growing
      conviction of the hopelessness of his experiment. The castle had as yet
      yielded to him nothing that he had not seen before in the distraction of
      company and the garishness of day. It was becoming a trifle monotonous.
      Yet fine&mdash;exceedingly; and now that a change of wind had lifted the
      fog, and the full moon shone on the lower half of the pictures of the
      gallery, starting into the most artificial simulation of life a number of
      Van Dyke legs, farthingales, and fingers that would have deceived nobody,
      it seemed gracious, gentle, and innocent beyond expression. Wandering down
      the gallery, conscious of being more like a ghost than any of the painted
      figures, and that they might reasonably object to him, he wished he could
      meet the original of one of those pictured gallants and secretly compare
      his fingers with the copy. He remembered an embroidered pair of gloves in
      a cabinet and a suit of armor on the wall that, in measurement, did not
      seem to bear out the delicacy of the one nor the majesty of the other. It
      occurred to him also to satisfy a yearning he had once felt to try on a
      certain breastplate and steel cap that hung over an oaken settle. It will
      be perceived that he was getting a good deal bored. For thus caparisoned
      he listlessly, and, as will be seen, imprudently, allowed himself to sink
      back into a very modern chair, and give way to a dreamy cogitation.
    
    
      What possible interest could the dead have in anything that was here?
      Admitting that they had any, and that it was not the LIVING, whom the
      Barbarian had always found most inclined to haunt the past, would not a
      ghost of any decided convictions object to such a collection as his
      descendant had gathered in this gallery? Yonder idiot in silk and steel
      had blunderingly and cruelly persecuted his kinsman in leather and steel
      only a few panels distant. Would they care to meet here? And if their
      human weaknesses had died with them, what would bring them here at all?
      And if not THEM&mdash;who then? He stopped short. The door at the lower
      end of the gallery had opened! Not stealthily, not noiselessly, but in an
      ordinary fashion, and a number of figures, dressed in the habiliments of a
      bygone age, came trooping in. They did not glide in nor float in, but
      trampled in awkwardly, clumsily, and unfamiliarly, gaping about them as
      they walked. At the head was apparently a steward in a kind of livery, who
      stopped once or twice and seemed to be pointing out and explaining certain
      objects in the room. A flash of indignant intelligence filled the brain of
      the Barbarian! It seemed absurd!&mdash;impossible!&mdash;but it was true!
      It was a holiday excursion party of ghosts, being shown over Stukeley
      Castle by a ghostly Cicerone! And as his measured, monotonous voice rose
      on the Christmas morning air, it could be heard that he was actually
      showing off, not the antiquities of the Castle, but the MODERN
      IMPROVEMENTS!
    
    
      "This 'ere, gossips,"&mdash;the Barbarian instantly detected the fallacy
      of all the so-called mediaeval jargon he had read,&mdash;"is the Helectric
      Bell, which does away with our hold, hordinary 'orn blowin', and the
      hattendant waitin' in the 'all for the usual 'Without there, who waits?'
      which all of us was accustomed to in mortal flesh. You hobserve this
      button. I press it so, and it instantly rings a bell in the kitchen 'all,
      and shows in fair letters the name of this 'ere gallery&mdash;as we will
      see later. Will hany good dame or gaffer press the button? Will YOU,
      mistress?" said the Cicerone to a giggling, kerchief-coifed lass.
    
    
      "Oi soy, Maudlin!&mdash;look out&mdash;will yer!&mdash;It's the soime old
      gag as them bloomin' knobs you ketched hold of when yer was 'ere las'
      Whitsuntide," called out the mediaeval 'Arry of the party.
    
    
      "It is NOT the Galvanic-Magnetic machine in 'is lordship's library," said
      the Cicerone, severely, "which is a mere toy for infants, and
      hold-fashioned. And we have 'ere a much later invention. I open this
      little door, I turn this 'andle&mdash;called a switch&mdash;and, has you
      perceive, the gallery is hinstantly hilluminated."
    
    
      There was a hoarse cry of astonishment from the assemblage. The Barbarian
      felt an awful thrill as this searching, insufferable light of the
      nineteenth century streamed suddenly upon the up-turned, vacant-eyed, and
      dull faces of those sightseers of the past. But there was no responsive
      gleam in their eyes.
    
    
      "It be the sun," gasped an old woman in a gray cloak.
    
    
      "Toime to rouse out, Myryan, and make the foire," said the mediaeval
      'Arry. The custodian smiled with superior toleration.
    
    
      "But what do 'ee want o' my old lanthorne," asked a yellow-jerkined stable
      boy, pointing to an old-fashioned horned lantern, tempus Edward III.,
      "with this brave loight?"
    
    
      "You know," said the custodian, with condescending familiarity, "these
      mortals worship what they call 'curios' and the 'antique,' and 'is
      lordship gave a matter of fifty pounds for that same lanthern. That's what
      the modern folk come 'ere to see&mdash;like as ye."
    
    
      "Oi've an old three-legged stool in Whitechapel oi'll let his lordship
      'ave cheap&mdash;for five quid," suggested the humorist.
    
    
      "The 'prentice wight knows not that he speaks truly. For 'ere is a braver
      jest than 'is. Good folks, wilt please ye to examine yon coffer?" pointing
      to an oaken chest.
    
    
      "'Tis but poor stuff, marry," said Maudlin.
    
    
      "'Tis a coffer&mdash;the same being made in Wardour Street last year&mdash;'is
      lordship gave one hundred pounds for it. Look at these would-be
      worm-holes,&mdash;but they were made with an AUGER. Marry, WE know what
      worm-holes are!"
    
    
      A ghastly grin spread over the faces of the spectral assembly as they
      gathered around the chest with silent laughter.
    
    
      "Wilt walk 'ere and see the phonograph in the libry, made by Hedison, an
      Hamerican, which bottles up the voice and preserves it fresh for a hundred
      years? 'Tis a rare new fancy."
    
    
      "Rot," said 'Arry. Then turning to the giggling Maudlin, he whispered:
      "Saw it las' toime. 'Is lordship got a piece o' moy moind that oi reeled
      off into it about this 'ere swindle. Fawney that old bloke there charging
      a tanner apiece to us for chaffin' a bit of a barrel."
    
    
      "Have you no last new braveries to show us of the gallants and their
      mistresses, as you were wont?" said Maudlin to the Cicerone. "'Twas a rare
      show last time&mdash;the modish silk gowns and farthingales in the
      closets."
    
    
      "But there be no company this Christmas," said the custodian, "and 'is
      lordship does not entertain, unless it be the new fool 'is lordship sent
      down 'ere to-day, who has been mopin' and moonin' in the corridors, as is
      ever the way of these wittol creatures when they are not heeded. He was
      'ere in a rare motley of his own choosing, with which he thinks to raise a
      laugh, a moment ago. Ye see him not&mdash;not 'avin' the gift that belongs
      by right to my dread office. 'Tis a weird privilege I have&mdash;and may
      not be imparted to others&mdash;save"&mdash;
    
    
      "Save what, good man steward? Prithee, speak?" said Marian earnestly.
    
    
      "'Tis ever a shillin' extra."
    
    
      There was no response. A few of the more bashful ghosts thrust their hands
      in their pockets and looked awkwardly another way. The Barbarian felt a
      momentary relief followed by a slight pang of mortified vanity. He was a
      little afraid of them. The price was an extortion, certainly, but surely
      he was worth the extra shilling!
    
    
      "He has brought but little braveries of attire into the Castle," continued
      the Cicerone, "but I 'ave something 'ere which was found on the top of his
      portmanteau. I wot ye know not the use of this." To the Barbarian's
      intense indignation, the Cicerone produced, from under his, his (the
      Barbarian's) own opera hat. "Marry, what should be this? Read me this
      riddle! To it&mdash;and unyoke!"
    
    
      A dozen vacant guesses were made as the showman held it aloft. Then with a
      conjuror's gesture he suddenly placed his thumbs within the rim, released
      the spring and extended the hat. The assembly laughed again silently as
      before.
    
    
      "'Tis a hat," said the Cicerone, with a superior air.
    
    
      "Nay," said Maudlin, "give it here." She took it curiously, examined it,
      and then with a sudden coquettish movement lifted it towards her own
      coifed head, as if to try it on. The Cicerone suddenly sprang forward with
      a despairing gesture to prevent her. And here the Barbarian was conscious
      of a more startling revelation. How and why he could not tell, but he KNEW
      that the putting on of that article of his own dress would affect the
      young girl as the assumption of the steel cap and corselet had evidently
      affected him, and that he would instantly become as visible to her as she
      and her companions had been to him. He attempted to rise, but was too
      late; she had evaded the Cicerone by ducking, and, facing in the direction
      of the Barbarian, clapped the hat on her head. He saw the swift light of
      consciousness, of astonishment, of sudden fear spring into her eyes! She
      shrieked, he started, struggled, and awoke!
    
    
      But what was this! He was alone in the moonlit gallery, certainly; the
      ghastly figures in their outlandish garb were gone; he was awake and in
      his senses, but, in this first flash of real consciousness, he could have
      sworn that something remained! Something terror-stricken, and retreating
      even then before him,&mdash;something of the world, modern,&mdash;and,
      even as he gazed, vanishing through the gallery door with the material
      flash and rustle of silk.
    
    
      He walked quietly to the door. It was open. Ah! No doubt he had forgotten
      to shut it fast; a current of air or a sudden draught had opened it. That
      noise had awakened him. More than that, remembering the lightning flash of
      dream consciousness, it had been the CAUSE of his dream. Yet, for a few
      moments he listened attentively.
    
    
      What might have been the dull reverberation of a closing door in the
      direction of the housekeeper's room, on the lower story, was all he heard.
      He smiled, for even that, natural as it might be, was less distinct and
      real than his absurd vision.
    
    
      Nevertheless the next afternoon he concluded to walk over to Audley Friars
      for his Christmas dinner. Its hospitable master greeted him cordially.
    
    
      "But do you know, my dear fellow," he said, when they were alone for a
      moment, "if you hadn't come by yourself I'd have sent over there for you.
      The fact is that A&mdash;- wrote to us that you were down at Stukeley
      alone, ghost-hunting or something of that sort, and I'm afraid it leaked
      out among the young people of our party. Two of our girls&mdash;I shan't
      tell you which&mdash;stole over there last night to give you a start of
      some kind. They didn't see you at all, but, by Jove, it seems they got the
      biggest kind of a fright THEMSELVES, for they declare that something
      dreadful in armor, you know, was sitting in the gallery. Awfully good
      joke, wasn't it? Of course YOU didn't see anything,&mdash;did you?"
    
    
      "No," said the Barbarian, discreetly.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
