Surely the lines&mdash;

"Trust, oh! trust me, I will be
Still true for ever, true to thee."

have never been more practically demonstrated, than in
the following extract, from an account of a poaching
affray, published in the Gamekeepers' Gazette.

"The dead gamekeeper's dog was to be seen by the
roadside restlessly waiting for its master, while he
lay in a cottage fatally riddled with shot."

PREFACE


This work&mdash;Sporting Dogs: Their Points and
Management in Health and Disease&mdash;has been prepared
as a companion volume to those already
published, viz., Non-Sporting Dogs: Their Points,
etc., and Toy Dogs, in response to numerous
inquiries from readers of those volumes, asking for
a work upon Sporting Dogs, to complete the series,
at a proportionate price.

The Points of the various breeds used by Sportsmen
have been freely discussed, supplemented by
illustrations from photographs of the most celebrated
animals known.

Kennel Management, The Management of Hounds,
Diseases, Accidents and Simple Operations forms
an important section of the work&mdash;features that
should render the book of far greater practical
utility than one dealing solely with the different
varieties of dogs.

[viii]

Both Author and Publisher, will be satisfied, if
it meets with the hearty reception accorded to the
companion publications.

In conclusion, the Author wishes to express most
hearty thanks to all Breeders and Exhibitors who
have so generously supplied him with Photographs:
to Our Dogs Gazette; The Kennel Gazette; The
Gamekeeper, etc.

SPORTING DOGS

CHAPTER I

The Pointer

Most authorities are in agreement that the English
Pointer has been derived from a cross of the old
Spanish Pointer and Southern Hound, or with the
former and a Foxhound.

The old Spanish Pointer was a heavy, loose-made
dog, had a large head, short and smooth coat, thin,
loose ears and a thin tail.

In colour he was generally black, black and white,
liver and white, red and white, dark brown, liver, etc.
The breed, it is said, was first introduced into this
country by a Portuguese merchant, living and shooting
in Norfolk.

According to accounts, the Spanish Pointers had a
remarkable degree of scenting power, never missing
their game.

In Germany there are two varieties of Pointers&mdash;the[4]
Rough-and the Smooth-coated. Like the old
Spanish Pointer, these dogs are slow, but sure
workers: they are heavily built, and frequently
liver, or liver and white.

The chief drawback to the Spanish Pointer was
his slowness, and indifferent temper. The French
Pointer was probably superior, and may have had
considerable influence towards making the many
good qualities possessed by the English Pointer of
to-day. A medium-sized dog is the most useful, the
heavy being too slow and the light weights too fast,
especially for aged shooters.

The Pointer may be described as fairly hardy;
generally of good constitution, and when bred from
working parents, puppies usually respond readily to
the breaker's tuition.

A second-, or third-season dog, is preferable to a
first-season one, so that, when purchasing, this should
be borne in mind. Another matter worthy of attention,
and that is, never to purchase a Pointer without
having him for a week or two's trial on your own
shoot.

The colour of a Pointer is more a matter for
individual taste, though there is no doubt that one
should choose such as can be the most readily discerned
in the distance. Lemon and white, black
and white, and liver and white ticked, especially
the last-named, are the most general colours.
Liver, and red and white are frequently seen, though
the former is not so readily recognisable on ploughed
land, etc.

[8][9]

In action, these dogs ought to move with beauty
and freedom, unobserved in any other breed.
The movements alone ought to be sufficient to create
admiration in the mind of the sportsman.

Head.&mdash;Should be of good size, wide in the
dome, and wider between the eyes, with a long,
broad, square nose and broad, well-dilated nostrils,
giving the head a somewhat square conformation.

In colour, nose ought to be black, but in lemon and
white dogs, flesh-coloured. Cartilages of ears, long
and thin, covered by soft hair, and carried close to
cheeks.

Eyes.&mdash;Of medium size.

Twenty-four per cent. of points are allowed for skull,
nose, eyes, ears, lips, and six for the neck, which
ought to be long, arched, and free from loose skin or
dewlap. Long oblique shoulders and long arms are
essentials of beauty in the Pointer. Forearms long,
having plenty of bone and muscle. Pasterns of
medium length, feet round (like those of the cat),
and the soles hard. A good deal of attention is
paid to the legs and feet, by Pointer judges. Some
prefer the hare-foot. The elbow must stand well off
the brisket and be low placed. Dog must not be
"out" at elbow. Viewed from the front, the chest of[10]
the Pointer, nevertheless, ought not to be broad, otherwise
the beautiful elastic step is interfered with.
The contour of the chest is round and deep. Back
ribs must be deep, and flanks broad and thick, so as
to give strength in these regions.

Back and Hind-quarters.&mdash;The back should be
of good length but strongly built, and the loins
broad and deep. First and second thighs well
covered with muscle; hocks strong and good;
stifles broad.

Too much importance cannot be attached to the
stern of the Pointer, and judges are keen on quality
in this region. First of all, it must be strong at its
"set on," and gradually taper to a fine point.

If the tail is as thick at the end as it is at its
"set on," or coarse in other respects, it indicates
inferior breeding. Should be carried on a line with
the back.

Faults.&mdash;Any approach to curl in tail, coarse
coat, soft feet, short back ribs, wide chest, too
heavy in head and facial expression, short on legs,
under-or over-sized, presence of flews or big cheeks,
undershot; too much of Hound character, bad
temper, disobedience, bad constitution, etc.

CHAPTER II

The English Setter

Most authorities, or those who have made diligent
inquiries into the history&mdash;if such it can be called&mdash;or
origin, of the English Setter, are agreed that it
has been derived from the Spaniel&mdash;Setting Spaniel&mdash;and
Laverack, in his work on the Setter, says,&mdash;

"I am of the opinion that all Setters have more or
less originally sprung from our various strains of
Spaniels, and I believe most breeders of any note
agree that the Setter is nothing more than a Setting
Spaniel. How the Setter attained his sufficiency of
point is difficult to account for, and I leave the
question to wiser heads than mine to determine.
The Setter is said and acknowledged by authorities
of long standing, to be of greater antiquity than
the Pointer. If this be true&mdash;and I believe it is&mdash;the
Setter cannot at first have been crossed with
the Pointer to render him what he is."

If the foregoing views be accepted, it follows that
our lovely Setter is but an improved Spaniel.

     An English Setter (Romney Rock).


[22][23]

The Laverack Setters&mdash;a strain preserved by the
late Mr Laverack&mdash;has always played an important
part in the more recent history of the Setter.
The Llewellin Setter&mdash;a strain bred by Mr Llewellin&mdash;(a
Laverack cross) stands out as being one of
the best strains ever produced, both on the show
bench and in the field.

A high-class English Setter should have a rich,
glossy coat, and every movement should be one of
elegance, dash, and beauty.

A high degree of intelligence and great power of
physical endurance are a sine qua non.

Field trials have done more towards perfecting
the working qualities of the Setter than could have
been attained by any other means.

The breeding of stock from dogs coming out top
at these trials affords the surest means of attaining
the highest degree of working capacity.

The points of the English Setter are as follows:&mdash;

Coat.&mdash;To be soft, silky, and free from curl. There
ought to be an abundance of soft feather on fore
and hind legs.

Colour.&mdash;Not a great deal of importance is
attached to this. The chief colours are:&mdash;Liver
and white, lemon and white, black, black and
white, red or yellow, orange Belton, black and
white ticked, with splashes of black, or bluish
tint&mdash;blue Belton, black, white and tan markings,
&amp;c. Black and white ticked are commonest.

[24]

Skull.&mdash;Long and narrow, with a well-developed
occipital bone. Muzzle square, and lips full at their
angles.

Ears and Eyes.&mdash;Ears set on low, thin and soft,
carried close to the cheeks, and covered by silky hair
about a couple of inches in length. Eyes of medium
size, either brown or hazel.

Neck.&mdash;Slightly arched and covered by somewhat
loose skin.

Back and Quarters.&mdash;Arched, and loins wide and
strong. Hocks, strong.

Tail.&mdash;Should be carried in a straight line with
the body, and the feather upon it to consist of
straight, silky hairs, shortening towards the point.
A beautiful flag is a great adornment to the Setter,
especially when at work.

Fore-limbs.&mdash;Shoulders set well back. Forearms
straight and strong, of medium length, and with a
good fringe at the back. Pasterns short and nearly
vertical. Feet well feathered below and cat-like.

Weight.&mdash;Dogs from 50 to 60 lbs. Bitches, 45 to
55 lbs. Club.&mdash;The English Setter.

Faults.&mdash;Curly coat, snipy head, bad carriage
of stern, too light in bone, too short or too long
in leg, out at elbows, too heavy in head, bad
symmetry, disobedience, bad scenting power, indifferent
at work, etc., etc.

[25]


The Irish Setter

The origin of these dogs, as in many other breeds,
is enshrouded in mystery. The theory that they
have been derived from Red Spaniels, crossed with
the Bloodhound, is accepted by some breeders, the
traces of Hound blood being observable in their
method of working (scenting their game), so much
objected to, by many sportsmen.


     
     Irish Setter Dog.


In Ireland these Setters have been, and still are,
greatly used for snipe shooting, being hardy, fast, and
very keen-nosed&mdash;their ability to bear fatigue, and
cold, being unequalled by any other variety of Setter.

[26]

It has been said that the finest and oldest strain
of Irish Setters have a slight tinge of black on the
tips of the ears and muzzle; others, again, regard
the presence of black hairs as a sign of impurity
of blood, agreeing that these dogs ought to be a very
deep, rich red&mdash;a dark or blood red being preferred.
White hairs ought not to be present anywhere,
excepting on the forehead and chest, though many
object to white in the situation last named.

The Coat should be close, of strong growth, and
neither coarse nor silky in texture. Feather of a
golden tinge, and of moderate amount.

Ears.&mdash;To be long, set low on the head, and have a
medium degree of feathering.

Eyes.&mdash;A deep hazel or brown, and the nose dark
or mahogany flesh. A black nose should disqualify.

Neck.&mdash;Of fair length, slightly arched, and body
proportionately long; the chest deep, and ribs well
sprung.

Forelegs.&mdash;Straight, not too much feathered, and
the feet small, firm, and close, with well-arched
toes.

Strong Loins, powerful thighs and hocks, and a
horizontal carriage of the tail (not cocked) are
excellences in this region.

Taken as a whole, the Irish Setter is built more
after the type of a racer. Moreover, has a little
wider skull than the English variety.

[28][29]

The Black-and-tan Setter (Gordon Setter)

This famous breed of Setters can be traced back
for a hundred years to the castle of the Duke of
Gordon, but whether this nobleman laid the foundation
stone of the present breed of Black-and-tan
Setter, becomes a matter of speculation.

It is not the least improbable that these Setters
have been derived by crossing the English Setter
with a Black-and-tan Collie, as certain Gordons exhibit
more than a trace of the Collie element.

During the last few years the Black-and-tan Setter
classes at the Kennel Club Shows in London have
been very badly filled, and unless breeding this
variety of dog becomes more popular, in England at
least, it will soon deteriorate.

A well-broken Gordon is a most useful dog in the
field, though certainly his luck at field trials has not
been anything like that of the Englishman.

In colour he should be a glossy raven black, with
rich mahogany tan markings, pencilling of the toes
being allowable.

On the inside of the fore-limbs, tan ought to show
nearly up to the elbows, and up to the hocks, on the
inner sides of the hind ones.

There should be tan on the lips, cheeks, undersides
of the ears; spots over eyes, on front of the chest,
on the vent, and at the root of tail or flag.

[30]

Eyes.&mdash;To be of medium size and deep brown.

Ears.&mdash;The ears of the Gordon are longer than
those of the Irish or English, are set on low and lie
close to head.

Head.&mdash;There ought to be good evidence of "stop,"
rendering the occiput well-defined.

From eye to occiput, head should measure nearly
6 inches.

The old type of Gordon was much too clumsy in
the head.

Neck.&mdash;Long, clean, and racey.

Shoulders and Chest.&mdash;Shoulders of good slope and
chest deep. Ribs to be well sprung.

Fore-limbs and Feet.&mdash;To be of moderate length;
strong in the forearms, and elbows well in. Feet
arched and cat-like.

A strong back, loin, and well-bent stifles are qualifications
of the Gordon.

Stern.&mdash;The tail carried as nearly in the same
line as the body. Many Gordons have defective
carriage of the caudal appendage.

The so-called "tea-pot" tail is the worst fault, and
destroys a dog's chance of winning in the show ring.

Gordon Setter puppies are not difficult to rear,
though good specimens are difficult to produce; still
more so to purchase, when grown up, and thoroughly
broken.

In America this variety of Setter is much thought[31]
of, and in that country a great deal has been done
towards the improvement of the breed, where the

Society be held in May or June in London, and
that a Special General Meeting may be called at
any time, and at such place as may be agreed to
by the Central Committee, on the requisition of six
members.

12. At every meeting the President, or one of
the Vice-Presidents, shall be chairman, or, failing
these, a member of the Central Committee; such[36]
chairman to have a casting vote at all meetings.
And, further, the minutes of the preceding meeting
shall be read, approved, confirmed, and signed by
the chairman at the commencement of the next
subsequent meeting.

13. Any member may withdraw from the Society
on giving notice in writing to one of the Honorary
Secretaries, or to the Central Secretary, provided
always that such member shall be liable for his
subscription to the Society for the current year in
which he gives such notice.

14. That the Central Secretary shall enter the
name and address of each member of the Society in
a Book kept for that purpose.

INTERNATIONAL GUNDOG LEAGUE

Pointer and Setter Society

Rules for the Trial Meetings

1. In Single Stakes the competing dogs shall be
drawn into pairs by lot, dogs belonging to the same
owner being guarded from each other as long as
possible. The Judges having seen each pair run as
drawn, if possible, will at the end of the first round[37]
give to the Committee the names of those dogs
which they consider have a chance of being placed.
The Committee will then proceed to draw these dogs
again, taking care that dogs which have met in the
first round do not run together in the second. At
the end of the second round the Judges will call up
at their own discretion, any dogs they require
further, and run them as they choose. If any dog
would, by the withdrawal of his antagonist before
running, be left untried, the Judge may order him
to run with any dog similarly circumstanced in
that round, or with the dog that has the bye. The
dog that has drawn a bye, if not called for previously
by the Judges, shall run as one of the first pair in
the next round.

2. In Brace Stakes, the two dogs running together
must belong to the same owner, and the order of
running in the first round shall be decided by lot.
No dog shall be allowed to form part of more than
one brace at the same meeting, and only one man at
a time shall work any brace.

3. In all Stakes the Judges will, except in cases of
undoubted lack of merit, try each pair in the first
round for at least fifteen minutes, and in Single
Stakes the first and second prize dogs must have run
together, likewise the second and third. In the Brace
Stake, all prize-winning braces must have been down
twice.

[38]

4. The Judges are requested not to award a Prize
to any dog unless they are satisfied that he will back
of his own accord.

5. The Judges will, in making their awards, give
full consideration to the manner in which the ground
is quartered and beaten, and are requested not to
award a Prize to the dog of any owner or handler
who does not beat his ground, and work exactly as
he would do were he actually out shooting.

6. The Judges will avoid, if possible, holding a dog
so long on his point, for the purpose of securing a
back, as to cause the birds to run: but if the pointing
dog be so held on a point by order of the Judge,
he shall not incur any penalty for misbehaviour in
reference to that particular point.

7. The Judges shall not decide the merit of a dog's
running from the number of times he points game,
backs, etc., but from the style and quality of his
performance as a whole. Dogs are required to
maintain a fast and killing range, wide or narrow, as
the necessity of the case demands; to quarter the
ground with judgment and regularity; to leave no
birds behind them; and to be obedient, cheerful, and
easily handled.

8. The Judges are requested and empowered by
the Committee to first caution, and upon repetition
of the offence, turn out of the Stake any breakers
not beating the ground to their satisfaction; not[39]
keeping together or out-walking their opponents;
unduly whistling or shouting, or behaving in such a
manner as, in the opinion of the Judges, is detrimental
to the chances of success of their opponents. Any
breaker or owner who feels that the behaviour of his
opponent is unsettling his dog, may request the
interference of the Judges.

9. A gun must have been fired over all aged dogs
as well as puppies before they can be awarded either
a Prize or a Certificate of Merit.

10. Certificates of Merit will be awarded with a
view to the establishment of Workers' Classes at the
Dog Shows, and as a guide to purchasers of dogs
which, though not in the list of Prize Winners, give
promise in their work of being valuable sporting
dogs. In a Brace Stake this honour may be conferred
on one dog without reference to the behaviour
of his companion.

11. The Judges are empowered to withhold a Prize
when, in their opinion, no merit is shown, and to
exclude from competition bitches on heat, or any
animals they may consider unfit to compete, and the
entry fees of such dogs will be forfeited.

12. After the first round the Judges may order a
flag to be hoisted at the end of each individual
contest to indicate which of the two competitors has
shown the greater merit in that particular trial.
The hoisting of the "colour" of a dog whose performance[40]
on that one occasion has been the more
meritorious will not necessarily imply that his
opponent is debarred from winning in the Stake.
When a striking evenness of merit is shown, both
flags will be hoisted simultaneously; and, conversely,
when there is a total lack of good work, no flags will
be displayed.

13. In the event of the weather being considered
by the Committee unsuitable for holding trials, it
shall be in their power to postpone the meeting from
day to day until the Saturday following the first day
of the trials, on which day either the stakes not
already decided shall be abandoned and their entry
fees returned, or a fresh draw for them shall take
place, at the discretion of the Committee.

14. If, from unforeseen circumstances, the Committee
deem it advisable to alter the date of the
meeting after the closing of the entries, this may be
done by sending formal notice to all competitors that
they may recover their entry fees by exercising the
option of cancelling their entries within four days
from the date of such notice. All entries, however,
about which no such application is made, within those
four days will stand good for the meeting at its
altered date.

The Committee also reserve to themselves the
right to abandon the meeting at any time, on returning
the entry monies to the competitors.

[41]

15. If any of the advertised Judges be prevented
from fulfilling their engagement for either the whole
or part of the Meeting, the Committee shall appoint
any other person to judge, or shall make any other
arrangement that to them seems desirable.

16. The Committee have the power&mdash;if they think
fit&mdash;to refuse any entries for the Society's Trials, and
if they consider that any persons by their conduct
or otherwise, are undesirable visitants at the Society's
Trials, they shall exclude such persons from the Trials,
without being obliged to assign any reason for their
action.

The disqualifications of any other recognised Trial
Society&mdash;British, Continental or otherwise, shall be
upheld by this Society.

17. An objection to a dog may be lodged with the
Secretary at any time within seven days of the last
day of any meeting, upon the objector depositing £5
with the Secretary, which shall be forfeited if the
Committee deem such objection frivolous. All
objections must be made in writing.

18. Upon any case arising not provided for in the
above rules, the members of the Committee present
shall decide, and their decision shall be final.

CHAPTER IV

Retrievers

(a) Flat-coated

There is good evidence to show that the Retriever
is what may be termed a "made" breed, and that
his present state of perfection is the outcome of
careful selection during the last fifty years or thereabout,
the latter thirty years of this time having
been devoted by enthusiastic sportsmen to raise the
standard of the Retriever to the highest standard of
excellence, and no one did more in this respect
than the lamented late President of the Kennel
Club, S. E. Shirley, Esq., Ettington Park, Stratford-on-Avon.

Most of Mr Shirley's exhibits were an ornament
to the show bench, and not only were they ornamental,
but equally useful in the field, this gentleman
being a keen sportsman and one of the most
successful breeders and exhibitors of Flat-coats
in the annals of this or any other time.

The Retriever is gradually coming more and more
into favour, and will continue to do so when his
usefulness becomes better known. It is a variety of
dog that stands little chance of becoming spoiled by
interbreeding, as in the case of so many Spaniels.

     Typical Flat-coated Retriever.


[46][47]

To the sportsman, the Retriever can claim advantages
over the Pointer, Setter and Spaniel, but
unless very thoroughly handled during his training,
he is not of much service. A perfectly broken
Retriever&mdash;more especially if rich in show-bench
points&mdash;should readily bring sixty or seventy
guineas at least, and cheap at that price.

Coat.&mdash;Should be perfectly flat&mdash;not wavy as
formerly&mdash;of an intense raven blackness,[1] glossy,
and the hair of good length and dense, more
especially over the tops of the shoulders and along
the back, but the contour ought not to be interfered
with.

White hair upon any part of the body, head, tail,
or extremities, is not desirable, and should, in the
author's opinion, tell against the animal. We are
aware that the presence of a few white hairs upon
the chest is not regarded as being of much importance.
Still, there is no gainsaying that to be perfect
in all points, the Retriever must not have such.

Head.&mdash;Ought to possess the highest degree of intelligence.
The occipital dome to be wide, of medium
height, becoming much narrower as the nose is approached;
the latter to be black.
[48]
Ears.&mdash;Small, carried close to cheeks, and thin
cartilage covered with soft hair, yet free from feather
at the margins.

Many Retrievers are very faulty here, a touch of
the Spaniel element sometimes being in evidence.

Eyes.&mdash;To be of a deep hazel. Any tendency
towards the so-called "snipy" nose is a defect.

Chest.&mdash;Deep, but not wide, and well covered with
soft, black hair.

Neck.&mdash;Somewhat short, but thick.

Back and Loin.&mdash;A long, strong back and loin,
slightly depressed about midway, with a beautiful
rise towards the hind-quarters. These latter should
be well muscled and covered by the same flatness
of coat.

Limbs.&mdash;Shoulders, strong and oblique, and forearm
big-boned and muscular; of medium length;
pasterns short and strong; feet of proportionate
size.

From the hinder face of the fore-limb there should
be a sparing amount of feather, not of sufficiency to
interfere with the dog when swimming.

When at rest the tail is carried down, but under
excitement straight out, though slightly below the
level of the back. Any tendency to curling of it, is
very faulty.

[52][53]


     
     Flat-coated Retriever Dog.


[54][55]

Many capital working Retrievers carry their tails
very badly, indicative of inferior breeding. What
is equally important&mdash;no matter whether it be the
Flat-, or Curly-coated variety&mdash;in a Retriever, is that
of being good-tempered, obedient, persevering, quick
to find, to remain at heel until given the word of
command, and to have a very tender mouth.

If a dog is too headstrong, he will never make a
good Retriever, running out directly a shot is fired.
Must respond with alacrity to his master's word of
command, in short, perfect obedience.

An "unstable" Retriever is not a useful dog;
in fact, an annoyance. The chief faults of a Flat-coated
Retriever are&mdash;too Setter-like in appearance,
wavy coat, short coat, Spaniel-like ears, rusty
tint, white hair, bad temper, disobedience, too long
on the leg, too short on the leg, too much of the
Newfoundland element, etc., etc.


(b) The Curly-coated

Of the two varieties, the Curly-coated can, we
think, lay claim to have been the first established.
In almost every particular, save that of coat, the
Curly Retriever corresponds to the description given
under the heading of (a)&mdash;the Flat-coat. Weight
about 80 lbs. Particular attention is paid by judges
to the coat. The dog must be covered all over with
small tight curls, the tail to be the same. Any
tendency towards slackness of curl or an open coat[56]
necessarily handicaps the dog in the show ring. If
black, should be free from any rusty tint, or from
white. Face clean, neck long, and chest deep.

Liver Curly-coated specimens are nothing like so
frequently met with as the black. Should be of an
intense liver, free from white hairs and a nose of
corresponding colour.

The Curly-coated Retriever Club has done much
towards encouraging breeding typical specimens.
Although very useful, we fancy that the Flat-coats
are in more demand, probably because really A1
Curly-coats are not so readily obtainable at a moderate
price, and an indifferent one, has not as good an
appearance as an indifferent specimen of the Flat-coats.

At the recent Kennel Club Shows in London, etc.,
the proportion of Flat-coats to Curly was as three to
one&mdash;the best evidence as to which is the most popular
variety.

Labradors

At the Kennel Club Show there are classes for this
variety of Retriever, and, in our opinion, the Labrador
will, in course of time, become very popular amongst
sportsmen, as they are excellent retrievers, when
properly broken. They are wavy-coated dogs, either
black, fawn, or yellow in colour, and, what is remarkable,
these coloured dogs often appear in a litter
belonging to a black sire and dam.

[57]

[58][59]

White specimens have been produced, and it seems
likely enough that a race of white Retrievers will, in
course of time, become established, though, from a
sportsman's view, they will not be as serviceable as
their black or darker-coloured brethren.

The author remembers several fawn-coloured
Labradors on an estate in Scotland, and the gamekeeper
spoke most highly of the breed for work,
though, constitutionally, somewhat delicate.

Constitutional Rules of the Retriever Society

1. That the object of the Society be to promote the
breeding of pure Retrievers, and to develop and bring
to perfection their natural qualities. In order to
carry out these purposes, a working trial, if practicable,
shall be annually held.

2. That the Society shall consist of a President,
Vice-Presidents, a Committee, and an unlimited
number of members.

3. That one-third of the Committee (exclusive of
officers) shall be withdrawn by lot each year, at the
Annual General Meeting for the first two years, and
afterwards by rotation, and members shall be elected
to fill their vacancies; the retiring members to be[60]
eligible for re-election. The President, Vice-Presidents,
and Honorary Secretaries shall be ex-officio
members of the Committee, and shall be elected
annually.

4. That the entire control and management of the
Society shall be vested in the Committee (of which
three shall form a quorum), who shall have power to
make bye-laws, and decide upon all matters in dispute
not provided for by the rules of the Society; and,
further, that any member of the Committee, if unable
to be present at a Committee Meeting, shall be permitted
(upon application for same) to vote by proxy,
duly signed, upon any resolution appearing upon the
agenda paper, except as provided in Rule 8.

5. That each candidate for admission shall be proposed
and seconded by members of the Society. The
candidate's name, rank, residence, and profession or
occupation, if any, shall be sent to the Secretary a
fortnight before the election of candidates at the
Committee Meeting; and that each member of the
Committee be advised, at least seven days beforehand,
of the proposed election of a new member of
the Society.

6. That the election of members shall be vested
solely in the Committee, and be made by ballot, two
black balls to exclude.

7. That for the present no entrance fee shall be
charged, and that the annual subscription shall be[61]
one guinea, payable 1st January in advance; and
that any member whose payments shall continue in
arrear for six months shall (due notice of such arrear
having previously been given in writing by the
Secretary) have his name struck off the list, and shall
cease to be a member of the Society. Any member
joining the Society after the 31st October in any
year shall not be liable for an annual subscription for
the current year. Life membership may be acquired
upon payment in a lump sum of ten guineas.

8. Any member of the Society who shall be proved
to the satisfaction of the Committee to have in any
way misconducted himself in connection with Dogs,
Dog Shows, or Trials, or to have acted in any way
which would make it undesirable that he should
continue to be a member, shall be requested to retire
from the Society; and if a resolution to that effect
shall be carried by three-fourths of the Committee
(present and voting), duly summoned or warned to
the consideration of the case, the member so
requested to retire shall henceforth cease to be a
member of the Society.

9. That subscriptions and donations, after payment
of all liabilities, shall be applied in such a manner as
the Committee shall determine, for prizes at Trials or
Workers' Classes at Dog Shows, or otherwise; and
all balance shall be invested for the use of the Society,
in such manner as the Committee shall direct.

[62]

10. That Committee Meetings may be held at each
Trial Meeting of the Society, or at such other times
and places as the Committee may determine, notice
thereof having been duly sent to each member of the
Committee.

11. That the Annual General Meeting of the
Society be held in May or June, in London, and that
a Special General Meeting may be called at any time,
at such place as may be agreed to by the Committee,
on the requisition of six members.

Vice-Presidents, shall be chairman, or failing these, a
member of the Committee, such chairman to have a
casting vote at all meetings. And, further, the
minutes of the preceding meeting shall be read,
approved, confirmed, and signed by the Chairman
at the commencement of the next subsequent meeting.

13. Any member may withdraw from the Society
on giving notice in writing to the Secretary, provided
always that such member shall be liable for his subscription
to the Society for the current year in which
he gives such notice.

14. That the Secretary shall enter the name and
address of each member of the Society in a book kept
for that purpose.

[63]

Rules Adopted at the Retriever Society

(Subject to Alteration)

1. Before the Trials a number will be drawn by
lot for each competing dog, and the dogs will be tried
by batches accordingly during the first round. The
handler of the dog must shoot with ammunition
supplied by the Committee, and he will not be allowed
to carry in his hand anything besides his gun. After
all the competing dogs have been tried, the Judges
will call up, at their own discretion, any dogs they
require further, and try them again. No dog can
win a prize which has not been subjected to both tests
of "walking up" and "driving."

2. All aged dogs will be expected to retrieve fur
as well as feather, if ordered to do so, but no handler
must send his dog after any game until bidden by a
Judge to do so. The Judges have power to order any
handler to set his dog to retrieve game not shot by
him personally.

3. The principal points considered by the Judges
are sagacity, steadiness, nose, dash, perseverance,
obedience, and retrieving. This last should be done
quickly, with a tender and dry mouth, and right up
to the hand.

4. Any dog not present to be tried in its turn, the
Committee reserve the right of disqualifying at the
expiration of fifteen minutes.

[64]

5. The Judges are empowered to turn out of the
Stake the dog of any person who does not obey them
or who wilfully interferes with another competitor or
his dog, and to withhold a prize when, in their opinion,
no merit is shown; and to exclude from competition
bitches on heat, or any animals they may consider
unfit to compete. The entry fees of all such dogs
will be forfeited.

6. Certificates of merit will be awarded with a
view to the establishment of Workers' Classes at the
Dog Shows, and as a guide to purchasers of dogs
which, though not in the list of prize-winners, give
promise in their work of being valuable Sporting
Dogs.

7. An objection to a dog may be lodged with the
Secretary at any time within seven days of a meeting,
upon the objector depositing with the Secretary the
sum of £2, which shall be forfeited if the Committee
deem such objection frivolous. All objections must
be made in writing.

8. The Committee have the power, if they think
fit, to refuse any entries for the Society's Trials,
without assigning any reason for their action.

9. In the event of the weather being considered by
the Committee unsuitable for holding the Trials, it
shall be in their power to postpone the Meeting from
day to day until the Saturday following the first day
of the Trials, on which day the Stakes not already[65]
decided shall be abandoned and their entry fees
returned.

10. The Committee reserve to themselves the right
to abandon the Meeting at any time, on returning
their entry monies to the competitors, and if, from
unforeseen circumstances, they deem it advisable to
alter the date of the meeting, after the closing of the
entries, this may be done by sending formal notice to
all competitors that they may recover their entry
fees by exercising the option of cancelling their
entries within four days from the date of such notice.
All entries, however, about which no such application
is made within those four days, will stand good for
the Meeting at its altered date.

11. If an advertised Judge be prevented from filling
his engagement for either the whole or part of the
Meeting, the Committee shall appoint any other
person to judge, or shall make any other arrangements
that to them seem desirable.

12. Upon any case arising not provided for in the
above Rules, the Members of the Committee present
shall decide, and their decision shall be final.

CHAPTER V

Spaniels


General Characteristics of the Different
Varieties


     


Regarding the
word "Spaniel" as
a generic title, and
the different varieties
(Toys excepted)
as "species"
belonging to this
genera, the author
purposes taking a
brief survey of certain features characteristic of
Spaniels, leaving distinctive features for discussion
under the various titles of classification as adopted
by the Kennel Club. Judging from the literature
at our disposal upon the subject, it is at once
evident that the Spaniel of to-day&mdash;no matter
how changed by selection&mdash;is of very ancient
lineage, having existed as the Springing Spaniel and
Cocking, for upwards of 600 years, and his uses were[67]
then, as they are&mdash;or rather ought to be&mdash;now: to
range well within gunshot, chase neither fur nor
feather; never give tongue; find quickly, and retrieve
tenderly on either land, or water.

All these excellences are revealed in many of the
beautiful old coloured sporting prints, now so highly
priced and prized, and so difficult to obtain, though
when obtained are a joy for ever, gladdening the
hearts of lovers of the old forms of such sport.

It is, we believe, universally accepted that the
Spaniel originally came from Spain, but during
what period, there is no reliable data to go upon.
The departure, from what we may conveniently
speak of as the normal type of Spaniel, is most
marked in that of the Irish Water Spaniel, more
especially in those coming from the north of
Ireland.

Adhering to our original intention of general comparison,
the author will first of all consider&mdash;

Temperament.&mdash;Most Spaniels are of a quick,
inoffensive disposition, a sour temper being oftener
the results of bad training than any inherent vice.

As with all other breeds, quarrels frequently arise
over canine love affairs, etc. Few, we think, can
speak of the Spaniel as a quarrelsome dog.

The sportsman's Spaniel&mdash;which is not commonly
the show-bench animal&mdash;is of hardy constitution,
taking the water in the coldest of weather, doing his[68]
eight or ten hours' work in a day, and roughing it in
the matter of food and kennelling.

The progeny of the working dog are not any more
trouble to rear than those of a rough-and-tumble
Terrier.

The "soft" constitution of so many black and Sussex
Spaniels is due to that foolish system (in breeding)
having been carried beyond all sense of reason.

All are water-loving dogs, and, when properly
trained, retrieve their game tenderly.

Coat.&mdash;Either flat, wavy, or curly, a flat coat being
typical of the up-to-date Spaniel. Many of the older
type have a strong tendency to show a "top-knot,"
and even now and again (Water Spaniels excepted), in
a litter of well-bred ones there is a reversion towards
this type. All have an abundance of feather on both
fore and hind limbs, Irish Water breed excepted.

Colour



 
  Irish Water Spaniel
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Liver.
 

 
  English&nbsp;Water&nbsp;Spaniel
  Liver and white, black and white, black, or black, white, and tan.
 

 
  The Clumber Spaniel
  White, with red, lemon, or orange patches.
 

 
  The Sussex Spaniel
  Golden liver.
 

 
  Field Spaniels(?)
  Black or tri-coloured, also liver and white, or tan.
 

 
  [69]Cocker Spaniels
  Black, black, white and tan, liver, roan, liver and white, black and white, red and white, etc., etc.
 

 
  English Springers
  Variously coloured.
 

 
  Welsh Springers
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do.
 



Liver, liver and white, black, and black and white,
are by far the most frequent colours of the Spaniel.
Tan markings are very common in Welsh Springers.

The Irish Water and the Clumber Spaniel are
really the only two varieties free from the introduction
of blood from other varieties of the breed.

Except in rare instances, the show-bench Sussex
contains a lot of Field Spaniel blood, the result of
crossing a typical Sussex Spaniel with a black bitch,
over twenty years since, and its perpetuation until
the present day.

Head and Ears.&mdash;They all agree in the anatomical
outlines of their skulls, the greatest breadth being in
the head of the Clumber.

Heavy facial expressions are characteristic of the
pure Sussex, the half-bred, or Jacobs' strain of
Sussex, and the Jacobs' strain of Black Spaniels.
Many Cockers also show it.

Long ears, not only long in the cartilage, but
heavily feathered&mdash;excepting the Northern Irish[70]
Water&mdash;are very characteristic of Spaniels, but this
large amount of hair in this region can hardly be
a recommendation for work, knowing that it is
very liable to become entangled in brambles, etc.

The occipital dome is well marked, and in some
there is evidence of "stop," as in Toys. Muzzles
generally broad; nose broad, and cheeks full.

Fore-limbs.&mdash;With the exception previously
alluded to, Spaniels all agree in having a short arm
and short forearm, largely augmented in the Spaniels
of to-day (excepting Clumbers, etc.) through the
introduction of Sussex blood.

From a sportman's point of view, this has been a
detrimental influence, short legs greatly interfering
with retrieving of hares, etc., although there may
be what can be described as compensatory advantages,
such as getting under the low runs of
brushwood, etc.

The older type of Field Spaniel was vastly
superior for work to many of the lethargical, long-bodied,
low-legged, semi-intelligent specimens on the
show benches at the present time.

Body.&mdash;Mostly of medium length, with well-sprung
ribs, strong back and loins.

Tail carried on a level with the back. In all, the
feet are full, and toes prominent, well feathered in
the interspaces.

Length of body has always been a marked feature[71]
of the Sussex, and "massiveness" characteristic of
body, head and limbs in the Clumber.

From the foregoing outlines, it must be allowed
that conformity of type throughout the whole of
the Spaniels is general.

The points, etc., of the different varieties are as
follows:&mdash;

The Clumber

Very early on, these Spaniels were bred at
Clumber House, the seat of the Duke of Newcastle,
one William Mansell having had the care of them
under the Duke for a great number of years, and
much was done to improve the beauty and utility
of this handsome variety of Spaniel.

It is, in the author's opinion, the one variety of
Spaniel that has suffered the least in the way of
introducing the blood of other species. To attempt
to cross the Clumber, with the object of making
some improvement, is defeating the first principles
of the Clumber exhibitor, purity of breed being
the aim of his affection.

On the other hand, the introduction of Clumber
blood into other strains of Spaniels, for working
purposes at least, is rather beneficial than otherwise,
and it is a cross frequently employed.

At one time the Duke of Portland had a very fine
kennel of Clumbers, and when these dogs appeared[72]
at the Palace or other Kennel Club Shows, they
simply swept the boards.

Mr Holmes of Lancaster had also a strong team,
though I did not like the appearance of his
Clumbers anything akin to those shown by the Duke.

Probably the handsomest&mdash;we will not say the
most typical&mdash;Clumber that ever adorned the show
bench was Mr Parkinson's Champion "Trusty,"
though, for some unknown reason, this exhibitor
quietly dropped from the show ring, and "Trusty"
sank into insignificance.

My dog, Champion "Psycho," was one of the most
typical Clumbers going the rounds, and deserved a
much more successful career than he had. He
was about as sweet-tempered a dog as it was
possible to have, and formed a most devoted attachment
to my mother, under whose care he chiefly
was.

At one time the classes for Clumber Spaniels were
well filled, though in recent years they have declined
considerably.

Lately His Most Gracious Majesty the King, and
the Duchess of Newcastle, have shown Clumbers, and
this alone should give a fresh impetus towards the
popularity of the breed. At anyrate, we hope it
will have this effect.

When carefully broken, Clumbers make excellent
workers, and can stand a lot of heavy work.

[73]


     
     Clumber Spaniel Dog (Bobs of Salop).


[74][75]

A typical Clumber must be long, low and heavy.
The author does not like a Clumber to be so short
on the leg that the belly nearly sweeps the ground,
and considers extreme lowness ought not to be
encouraged. The Americans bred their Clumbers
for use more than show bench, consequently kept up
a good useful sort. Of course, any tendency to
legginess is fatal to type.

Weight, about 55 lbs.; bitches a trifle less, and
big in bone.

The Head of a Clumber is very characteristic.
It must be "massive" in every sense of the word,
or wide in all proportions, and the nose broad, full
and flesh-coloured&mdash;a Dudley nose.

Ears.&mdash;Long, carried close to head and "set on"
low with feathering on front edge, not elsewhere.
[2]
Eyes.&mdash;Deeply set in orbits, and rather large.

Coat.&mdash;Soft, silky, shining, straight, dense, and
feather long and profuse.

For colour markings, we prefer orange ears, with
an evenly marked head and ticked legs. Orange is
a common marking. Less marking on the body
the better.

Powerful loins; a long and straight back, and a[76]
nicely rounded croup are essentials of beauty. A
deep chest, well-rounded ribs, and powerfully-built
fore-quarters are equally important.

A good Clumber must have staying power, and
if he has not a well-developed muscular system, he
cannot have this requisite.

Neck.&mdash;To be of medium length and stoutly built.

The head, body and hind-quarters constitute
fifty per cent. of the total value of points, and the
neck and shoulders fifteen per cent., hence the
significance of being well done up in these regions.

Stout arms and forearms, with an abundance of
feather, are necessary.

A good deal of brushing and combing, together
with washing before showing, are needful to make
the Clumber look fit. His heavy appearance can
be increased by keeping him a bit above average
condition.

One should be able to purchase a good pup&mdash;one
likely to make a winner&mdash;for, say, ten guineas.

Club.&mdash;Clumber Spaniel.

The Sussex Spaniel

This is a very old variety of Spaniel, said to
have originated in the county of Sussex, in the
locality of Rosehill.

[77]


     
     Mr Newington's Sussex Spaniel Dog Rosehill Rock.


[78][79]

Five-and-twenty years ago, typical specimens of
the Rosehill strain were scarce, and since that time
not a great deal has been done towards maintaining
the purity of breed.

Very few Spaniels shown in the Sussex classes
can claim purity of breeding, the introduction of
black blood by mating Champion Bachelor to
Negress, being the cause of this. Jacobs Bachelor
was by Buckingham ex Peggie and own brother to
Rover III.&mdash;though very different types of Spaniels.

The author was personally acquainted with these
and many other old Sussex Spaniels.

I always took Buckingham to be a very typical
Sussex and Rover III. was much of the same
stamp as his sire; whereas Bachelor was more
akin to the Dam Peggie&mdash;of course much her
superior, though quite unlike his brother, Rover III.

At one time the judges would not look at
Champion Bachelor, Messrs Willet then preferring
Rover III.

Later on the order was reversed, and we believe&mdash;though
cannot be certain&mdash;at the London Kennel
Club Show. Champion Lawyer&mdash;at one time in my
possession&mdash;was a heavily built type of Sussex.
The Rev. Mr Shields, Mr Fuller, and Mr Newington,
all had some of the pure Rosehills, and I also bought
a good bitch from Mr Henry Hawkins by Rover
III. ex Duchess. The last time that old Buckingham
ever appeared on the show bench&mdash;and then not for[80]
competition&mdash;was at the Royal Lancashire Agricultural
Society's Show, held at Preston about 1880.

Although the litter out of which I bought
Countess was an exceptionally good one&mdash;and
Countess very typical&mdash;Messrs Willet would not
award them prizes, owing, they said, to the faintest
evidence of tan markings, observed with difficulty.

The typical colour for the Sussex is a light golden
liver, and this Bachelor certainly was, Rover being
darker.

Poor old Bachelor had a violent death through
fighting with a kennel companion&mdash;a Gordon Setter.

Champion Rover III. was withdrawn from the
show ring for some reason.

Even in those days animated discussion went on
in the Press as to what was and what was not
typical of the Sussex. There is no gainsaying one
fact, and that is that the Sussex of twenty years
ago existed in a different state of purity to what he
does in the present day.

In casually looking over recent entries at the Kennel
Club Show of Sussex Spaniels, it is questionable
whether there is a single animal so entered that can
justly claim the title of Sussex.

When Mr Jacobs had old Champion Bachelor in
his possession, he had not more than one Sussex
bitch to mate him with, to my recollection. There
can be no doubt that the great improvement&mdash;for[81]
the show bench&mdash;of the modern Spaniels began when
Jacobs crossed Bachelor with old Negress, a black
Field Spaniel bitch. It destroyed the purity of the
Sussex, but if it had not been indulged in, there
would, in all probability, have been no class for the
breed now. Blacks, livers, and liver and tan, all used to
come in the same litter out of Negress, who certainly
constituted the nucleus of a fortune to her owner.

The points of the Sussex are as follows:&mdash;

Colour.&mdash;Deep golden liver.

Coat.&mdash;Flat, and slightly wavy, but absolutely free
from any tendency to curl. Soft and abundant.

Weight.&mdash;About 40 lbs.

Head.&mdash;Heavy, though smaller and lighter than
that of the Clumber.

Eyes.&mdash;Rather deeply set, giving the dog a very
thoughtful expression.

Ears.&mdash;These should be long and well clothed with
long, silky hair. Above, the ears ought to be rather
narrow, but broad below, set on low down, and
carried close to sides of head.

Nose.&mdash;Broad and liver-coloured, open nostrils.

Neck.&mdash;Short and strong, and the back long, strong,
and level.

Shoulders and Chest.&mdash;A fairly deep chest, oblique
shoulders, and well-sprung ribs are necessary.

Flat-sidedness, and "tucked up under" are decidedly
faulty.

[82]

Fore-limbs.&mdash;Must be short on the leg. Arms and
forearms short but well boned. Crooked fore-limbs
are objectionable; turned out at elbows equally
bad. There should be an abundance of feather
springing from the backs of the fore-limbs, and down
to the hocks, in the hind ones.

For the show bench the more feather the better.

Feet also well feathered, round and strong. The
chief faults of the Sussex are: white hairs on any
portion, tan markings, curly coat, too leggy, light in
body, snipy head, short ears, want of feather, bad
constitution, and Bloodhound expression on face.

Field Spaniels

To attempt to define the term "Field Spaniel" so as
to be free from objection, would be, indeed, a difficult
problem.

Unquestionably it is a very ambiguous term, and
capable of wide interpretation. The mere fact of the
Kennel Club and other shows having a class or
classes for Field Spaniels, does not satisfy (though it
simplifies classification) the mind of the thoughtful
observer.

Anything from a half-bred Clumber, or Irish
Water Spaniel may constitute a Field Spaniel, and
rightly so, in the eyes of a sportsman.

That such dogs would win&mdash;say at a Kennel Club[83]
Show&mdash;could not be entertained for a moment. It is
the cross-bred Sussex that generally comes out top,
and the longer and lower and more Sussex-like in
character, the better the chances of success on the
show bench. These are the author's views, though
they may not coincide with those of others.

Some twenty-five years ago the "modern" Field
Spaniel was as yet unknown. Jacobs' Champion
Kaffir and Royle's Champion Zulu, and my dog Negro
(by Kaffir ex Negress) were all black Field Spaniels
of the Sussex type.

Zulu, with his Bloodhound-like eyes, had a remarkable
show career, so had Kaffir, but they were
not Field Spaniels from a sportsman's point of view,
more especially Zulu. I had the two best pups[A]&mdash;one
whole black and the other liver and tan&mdash;though,
unfortunately for me, they both died from distemper
before they were three months old. The black
puppy I remember in particular. He was a
facsimile of his dad, old Champion Bachelor, and
had he lived, might have proved to be a little gold
mine. Like his brother, nothing would ever have
persuaded me that he was a "Field Spaniel," accepting
that term as did the sportsman of days gone by.

My black Spaniel, Negro, though a big winner,
was about as stupid a sportsman's dog or companion
as ever saw daylight. The author's opinion is that[84]
a Field Spaniel should have a fair length of leg, be
of good size, have short, thick ears, and not much
feather on them, or yet on the legs. Should be
stoutly built, have a good tight jacket, be big-boned,
have nice full eyes, well-rounded ribs, and,
above all, quick hearing and a sound constitution.
Colour unimportant, but black and white, black, or
black, white and tan, or liver and white, for
preference. Weight 40 to 50 lbs. There is no
doubt that in course of time the Field Spaniel Trials
will do much towards building up a proper type of
field dog. A flat coat, of silky texture, and very glossy:
long, heavily-feathered ears, short, strong, straight,
cull-feathered fore-limbs, long body, and well-sprung
ribs, long, graceful neck, and a long, moderately-wide
head, with level carriage of the tail, are points of
the Show Field Spaniel. Black (no white) or particolours
(also liver) are preferred.

The Cocker Spaniel

This is a pretty type of small Spaniel, and one
that has been in existence from a very early
date.

Modern Cockers have been bred in all sorts of
ways, though lately it has become a fairly general
rule to breed only Cocker with Cocker, not necessarily
of the same colour. A typical Cocker should weigh
between 20 and 25 lbs., and be of smart, active
appearance.

[85]


     
     Typical Cocker Spaniel.


[86][87]

Probably two of the most successful black Cocker
Spaniels ever adorning the show bench were Obo
and Miss Obo. My (formerly Mr Easton's) Champion
Bess was a very typical variety Cocker.

The American clubs' standard for Cockers is not
quite the same as the English, the weight there being
from 18 to 28 lbs.

Head.&mdash;Ought to be of medium length, and the
muzzle square cut off, tapering from the eye, though
there must be no appearance of the so-called
"snipy" head.

There is a marked "stop," and from it there is a
groove running up the skull, gradually fading away.

Ears.&mdash;Set on low, covered with long, silky, straight
or wavy hairs, and reaching at least to the tip of nose.

Coat.&mdash;To be free from any sign of curl, plentiful,
straight, or wavy and silky. Body of medium length,
with well-sprung ribs, fairly deep chest, and full in
the flanks. Many Cockers are very defective here,
being what is called "tucked up."

Short fore-legs, strong, straight, well feathered,
and well-placed, good-sized, feet. The tail should be
carried on a level with back when dog is at ease, but
lower under excitement.

Colour.&mdash;Unimportant; regularity and beauty of
markings (if any) being qualifications.

[88]

Clubs.&mdash;The English Cocker Spaniel; the American
Cocker Spaniel.

Prices.&mdash;Very typical puppies can be bought for
three or four guineas shortly after weaning.

Faults.&mdash;Top-knot, out at elbows, light in bone,
too leggy, and, from a sportsman's view, too short on
leg. In whole-coloured specimens white is objectionable;
shallow flanks, high carriage of tail, deafness,
and bad constitution. Narrowness of chest, flat-sidedness,
and a narrow flank constitutes faulty conformation.


The Irish Water Spaniel

There are said to be two distinct types of Irish
Water Spaniels, one coming from the South and the
other from the North of Ireland. The former is
usually pure liver-coloured, with long and well-feathered
ears, whereas the latter has short ears, and
the liver colour mixed with considerable white.

One of the most characteristic features of the Irish
Water Spaniel is his "top-knot," consisting of a
crown of hair from the occiput to between the eyes,
leaving the temples free. These Spaniels, to a
sportsman of but slender means, in particular, cannot
be over-valued. They are, so to speak, born to water,
and in their element when retrieving wild-duck in
the depth of winter, requiring very little tuition.

[89]


     
     Irish Water Spaniel Pat O'Brien (Property of
Major Birkbeck).


[90][91]

A famous dog of this variety, and one that
had a wonderful show-bench career, was Mr Skidmore's
Larry Doolan. The writer remembers this
dog very well, as he was shown from north to south,
east to west.

In Colour, these Irishmen should be a dark liver,
free from any white hairs, unless it be a very small
patch on the breast, or toes. A boiled liver (sandy)
colour is objectionable.

Nose.&mdash;Large, of the same colour, and the Eyes a
deep amber.

Skull.&mdash;High in the occipital dome, and of good
width. A good top-knot essential.

Ears.&mdash;Set on low, having long cartilage (15 to 20
inches), and well feathered, the hair in this region
being wavy and profuse.

Hair on tail short, and straight, blending the curls,
towards its set-on , with those on the stern. Tail,
whip-like.

Neck.&mdash;Long and well set up, blending below with
strong shoulders.

A deep chest, strong back and loins, are necessary
for the working capacity of the breed.

Coat.&mdash;Very important. To consist of tight, crisp
curls all over body, and limbs. Fifteen per cent. of
points go to the coat.

Height (shoulder measurement).&mdash;Not more than 24
inches, or less than 20 inches.

General Appearances.&mdash;To win, the Irish Water[92]
Spaniel must look proportionate all over, be active,
have a tight curly coat and a good top-knot, carry the
head well up, be keen in facial expression, have a
cat-like tail, and look as though he would be ready to
dive at the word of command&mdash;in fact a workman
from top-knot to tail.

Faults.&mdash;Total absence of top-knot, a fully
feathered tail and much white hair will disqualify.
An open woolly coat, light in colour, cording of
hair, Setter feathering on legs, and a moustache,
are objectionable, and should tell heavily against an
Irishman in the show-ring.

Weight.&mdash;55 to 65 lbs.

Club.&mdash;The Irish Water Spaniel Society.

The English Water Spaniel

Bewick gives an excellent figure of a large Water
Spaniel. It is generally liver-coloured and white,
with the hair on the body in little curls. The dog is
of medium size, strong, active and intelligent, and
used by the water-fowl shooter.

In the Gentleman's Recreation and in the Sportman's
Cabinet, this variety of dog is also described.

In the writer's opinion, there are plenty of these
dogs to be seen about at the present time. They are
larger than the Field Spaniel, and stronger built[93]
altogether, looking as though they had both the
blood of Retriever and Irish Water Spaniel in
them.

The English Water Spaniel Club looks after the
interests of this breed, and the Kennel Club provides
a class for them.

A narrow head, small eyes, large nose, straight
neck, strong back, rather narrow, deep chest, long
strong legs, large feet, a six-inch dock, with a coat
of ringlets or curls (no top-knot), and good general
appearance, are the chief points.

Black, liver, liver and white, black and white, black
and liver, are the accepted colours, but pied is most
admired.

In addition to this breed of Spaniel, the Kennel
Club also provides classes for English Springers and
Welsh Springers.

The Sporting Spaniel Society

Regulations (subject to Alteration)

1. In Single Stakes for Spaniels, the order of
running shall be decided at the Draw. At the end of
the first round the Judges will call up, at their own
discretion, any dogs they require further, and run
them as they choose. The Judges will, except in a
case of undoubted lack of merit, try each Spaniel for
at least fifteen minutes in the first round, but they
can carry on the trial of two dogs simultaneously,
not ordering down together two dogs worked by the[99]
same person or belonging to the same owner. All
shooting will be done by guns appointed by the
Committee.

2. In Brace and Team Stakes the order of running
in the first round shall be decided by lot, and
the dogs composing a brace or team must belong to
the same owner. No dog shall form part of more
than one brace or team at the same Meeting, and
only one man at a time shall work any brace or
team.

3. In all Stakes the Spaniels shall be regularly
shot over in the customary sporting manner, and may
be worked up and down wind, and on feather and fur.

4. In all Stakes the principal points to be considered
by the Judges are scenting power, keenness,
perseverance, obedience, freedom from chase, dropping
to shot, style, method of beating and working
to the gun&mdash;whether in cover, hedgerow, or the open.
In Single Stakes, besides, the Spaniels are expected
to retrieve at command as required&mdash;tenderly,
quickly and right up to the hand; and any additional
excellence, such as dropping to hand and shot,
standing to their game and flushing it at command,
etc., will be taken into account; while in Brace or
Team Stakes they are expected to beat their ground
harmoniously together. In all Stakes with puppies
under twelve months old, the retrieving of fur shall
be optional.

[100]

5. Any dog not present to run in its turn, the
Committee reserve the right of disqualifying at the
expiration of fifteen minutes.

6. The Judges are empowered to first caution,
and, upon repetition of the offence, turn out of the
Stake the dog of any person who does not beat the
ground to their satisfaction; to withhold a prize when,
in their opinion, no merit is shown; and to exclude
from competition bitches on heat, or any animals
they may think unfit to compete. The entry fees of
all such dogs will be forfeited.

7. An objection to a dog may be lodged with the
Secretary at any time within seven days of a Meeting,
upon the objector depositing with the Secretary
the sum of £2, which shall be forfeited if the Committee
deem such objection frivolous. All objections
must be made in writing.

8. The Committee have the power, if they think
fit, to refuse any entries for the Society's Trials without
assigning any reason for their action.

9. In the event of the weather being considered
by the Judges unsuitable for holding the Trials, it
shall be in their power to postpone the Meeting from
day to day until the Saturday following the first day
of the Trials, on which day the Stakes not already
decided shall be abandoned and their entry fees
returned.

10. The Committee reserve to themselves the[101]
right to abandon the Meeting at any time, on returning
their entry monies to the competitors, and if,
from unforeseen circumstances, they deem it advisable
to alter the date of the Meeting after the closing of
the entries, this may be done by sending formal
notice to all competitors, who may exercise the
option of cancelling their entries within four days
from the date of such notice, in which event their
entry fees will be returned to them. All entries,
however, in regard to which no such option is
exercised, will stand good for the Meeting at its
altered date.

11. If an advertised Judge be unable to fulfil his
engagement for the whole or part of the Meeting, the
Committee shall appoint any other person to judge,
or shall make any other arrangements that to them
seem desirable.

12. The decisions of the Committee present shall,
in all matters arising at the Meetings, be final and
conclusive, and shall bind all parties.





[102]



CHAPTER VII

Training Spaniels

(being an Extract from "Land and Water")

"Most people are contented if a dog will work
within gunshot and push out the game for him
to kill. Almost any mongrel with the necessary
practice and experience will do this, but I assume
that the sportsman takes a pride in his dogs, likes
to have good-looking and well-bred ones, and if he
wishes to shoot in comfort and in good form when
he uses Spaniels, it is quite as necessary to have
them well-trained as any other breed of sporting dog.
I will therefore give such directions as experience
has taught me are useful. I know no dog that
more repays the trouble of breaking yourself (that
is, if you have the requisite knowledge and
patience) than the Spaniel, who, from natural love
and affection he has for his master more than any
other dog, should be more ready to work for him
than anyone else. The Spaniel's natural love of and
ardour in hunting require a firm hand over him until[103]
he is matured. There is an old saying that 'A
Spaniel is no good until he is nearly worn out.'
There is a great deal of truth in this, and the
Spaniel's enthusiasm must be largely reduced before
he can get down to cool, earnest work. I recollect
an old bitch, that belonged to a Devonshire sportsman,
that was so cunning that she used to catch as much
game as he shot. When the old man died, I bought
the bitch, as she had a great reputation; but she
was far too much of a pot-hunter for me. I could
have backed her against a moderate gun any day.

"Spaniels get very knowing in working to the gun
after a few months, and it is astonishing what efforts
they will make to manœuvre the game out to the
shooter. I have seen numberless instances of this,
particularly in hedgerow shooting, when I have
frequently seen a clever old dog, on winding game,
not make a rush at it, which would have had the
effect of sending it out on the other side, but pop
through the fence and push it out to you. This, as I
have said, is only acquired by experience; and a
young, vigorous Spaniel will sometimes push up the
game, irrespective of lending any aid to the gun. A
really good Spaniel, even when he is busy questing
and bustling about, should always have an eye to
the gun, and to work to it instead of for himself
and his own gratification and amusement. You cannot
well begin too early to train young Spaniels to[104]
get their noses down and to hunt close; to work
thoroughly every bit of ground and every hole and
corner that can possibly shelter a head of game.
This is what the Spaniel is required to do when he
is grown up; and in order to inculcate this habit in
him, and to discourage him in what he is so prone
to do&mdash;namely, go ahead&mdash;you should begin by
flinging small bits of meat or boiled liver into small
patches of turnips in a garden, or small patches of
thick bushes, or any kind of covert that will cause
him to seek for it with his nose, and not with his
eye. By no means enter your young Spaniels to
rabbits if you can avoid it; they take to them
naturally when they get the chance, and there is no
fear of their not having the opportunity soon enough.
Enter them to winged game, by all means, and for
this purpose get an old cock partridge, cut one wing,
and put him into a small patch of thick covert.

"Never take young Spaniels into large or thick
coverts where they can get away from under your
eye. Confine your working ground to small bits of
covert, patches of turnips, bushes, bits of gorse&mdash;any
thing, in fact, where you will be likely to have
thorough control over them, and where they are in
reach of an attendant; whom you should always
have with you to turn them to your whistle. I
have found it a first-rate plan to take them out on
the sides of rivers and ponds, where there are lots of[105]
moorhens, and plenty of sedge and rushes; let them
hunt in the rushes till they are tired, and a morning's
work of this kind will do them more good than
anything I know of. They soon become fond of
the work; it teaches them to work close, and they
are perfectly under the control of yourself and
assistant.

"Teach them early to drop to hand and shot, and
spare no pains about it; this is a part of a Spaniel's
education which is generally neglected. I know many
men who, instead of making them drop to shot, make
them come to heel, using the words 'come around,'
or 'heel.' It answers every purpose; and as it
brings every dog to you, and he has to work right
away from you again when he gets the signal, it has
its advantages in keeping them under control; but,
on the whole, I prefer the dropping to shot and wing
instantly. It is difficult to make a Spaniel drop to
fur; and if you can keep him from chasing, merely
putting up hares and rabbits, but not following
them after they are started, rest satisfied that little
more is necessary or desirable.

"I once saw an interesting thing of this kind. I
was shooting with a gentleman near Southampton,
in one of his coverts, to a team of small Clumbers;
we were both standing in a ride, and saw a charming
little bitch feathering near us towards the ride. Just
as she got to it, out popped a rabbit and scuttled[106]
down the ride, followed out of the covert by the
bitch; but as soon as she cleared the wood and was
in the ride, close on to the rabbit, which she had not
seen till then, down she dropped entirely of her own
accord. She had not seen either of us, neither did
we know that we were each observing this pretty
bit of work until we compared notes a few minutes
after, and agreed that we had never seen anything
better. It is rather difficult to describe, but to me it
was worth all the afternoon's shooting, and it made an
impression at the time which is as fresh as ever
now. She was, I need scarcely say, thoroughly
broken.

"If it is desired to make young Spaniels take water,
and they show any disinclination to it, the best plan
is to take them to a stream which you can wade
through. Walk through to the other side, and they
will probably follow you at once; if they do not,
walk straight away from the opposite side and go
out of sight; they will come, after making a little
fuss about it. If you have not a suitable shallow
stream, but are obliged to make use of a deep river
for your purpose, get an attendant, whom they do
not know, to hold your puppies while you go round
by a bridge out of their sight, and come down
opposite to them, and follow the instructions I have
given above. Remember many young dogs have, at
first, a great fear of getting out of their depth all at[107]
once, but will freely dabble into a shallow stream;
so that it is best to lead them on by degrees. Once
having got off their legs, and finding that it is an
easy matter to swim, there will be no further trouble.
Always choose warm weather for this teaching.
There is, however, no better plan of teaching them
to take to the water than letting them hunt moorhens.
As to whether Spaniels should be taught to
retrieve or not, will depend upon what your requirements
are, the number you use, and so on.

"If you own but one dog, by all means take all the
trouble you can to perfect him in this business; and
for this purpose you should choose your whelp from
a strain that retrieves naturally.

"If you work three or four Spaniels together, unless
they are thoroughly broken, they all want to retrieve,
and it is often the cause of much trouble. Nothing
looks worse than to see several dogs all tugging at
one bird, except, perhaps, the bird itself afterwards.
If your dogs are sufficiently broken and under command,
and will drop to shot or come to heel, and you
can direct either one of them to find the wounded
game, while the others remain down or at heel, you
can let them take it in turn which shall be allowed
the pleasure and honour of recovering the wounded;
but how rarely one sees Spaniels so well under
command as this. In the case of a team of Spaniels,
I think it better that they should not be allowed to[108]
retrieve, and this duty is better confined to a regular
retriever.

"It is a good plan with young Spaniels to walk
round a covert towards evening, when pheasants are
out at feed in the stubbles, having an attendant with
you to prevent them getting into covert, and walk in
a zigzag way about the stubbles; you can generally
give them plenty of practice in this way, and enter
them well to the scent of winged game. If your
puppies do not readily return to your whistle, but
show a disposition to go on, turn your back upon
them and go the other way, which will generally have
the desired effect&mdash;and a rate or a crack of the whip
from your attendant will greatly aid it. If a puppy
is too fast, put up a fore-leg in his collar, or tie a
strap tightly round one hind-leg just above the hock;
but neither of these must remain long without changing,
or you will produce swelling and inflammation.
Apart from the pleasure and satisfaction there is in
shooting to dogs of your own breaking, there is this
advantage that they learn to understand your ways,
and to know thoroughly your every look and motion,
while you at the same time perfectly understand
them.

"In selecting young Spaniels to break, if you do not
breed your own, be most particular in getting them
from a good working strain, of a sort that a friend of
mine designates as 'savage for work.'

[109]

"To work Spaniels in thick, large woods, you should
always go with them to work them, or send someone
they are accustomed to work with, or they will
become wild or slack."

CHAPTER VIII

The Foxhound

At no period of English history has fox-hunting, with
Horse and Hound, been more vigorously pursued than
it is during the twentieth century.

Scattered from north to south, east to west, are
approximately some two hundred packs of these
magnificent specimens of the canine race.

Judging from the excellent sport enjoyed by the
majority of hunts during this last season, one has no
need to be sceptical as to the progress and continuance
of this grand and manly form of sport.
Looking back on the times when such great followers
of the chase as Peter Beckford and Mr Apperley
("Nimrod"), one is apt to think that through lapse
of time, agricultural depression, and inroads made
into the country through commercial industry, fox-hunting
might well-nigh have become a sport of the
past, but, happily, this is not so.

Given good weather and a favourable season, there
is as good sport to be obtained with Horse and Hound
as in the days of Beckford. The modern Foxhound,[114]
has, by selection, been derived from the old Southern
Hound, a dog that had longer ears, was heavier built,
and slower.

This Hound was supposed to have been used by
the Ancient Britons for hunting the larger game
present at that time.

The number of Hounds constituting a pack varies,
and if the pack is a very large one, the dogs and
bitches are hunted alternately.

As to which is the best for hunting, opinions vary.

From twelve to twenty-five couples may be taken
as the average number working at one time.

The following is a description of the Foxhound,
taken from the Foxhound Stud Book:&mdash;

Head, of full size, but by no means heavy.

Brow pronounced but not high or sharp.

There must be good length and breadth, sufficient
to give in the dog Hound a girth in front of the ears
of fully 16 inches. The nose should be long (4½
inches) and wide, with dilated nostrils.

Ears set on low and lying close to the cheek.

The neck must be long and clean, without the
slightest throatiness. It should taper nicely from the
shoulders to the head, and the upper outline should
be slightly convex.

The shoulders ought to be long and well clothed
with muscle without being heavy, especially at the
points. They must be well sloped, and the arm
must be long and muscular, but free from fat and
lumbar.

[116][117]


     
     Enemies at Peace&mdash;Foxhound Nameless and Tame Dog Fox (Property of Mr Walter Winans).


[118][119]

The chest should girth over 30 inches in a 24-inch
Hound, and back ribs to be deep. The back and the
loin both ought to be very muscular, running into
each other without any contraction (waist) or nipping
between them.

The couples must be wide even to raggedness, and
there should be the slightest arch in the loin, so as
to be scarcely perceptible.

The hind-quarters, or propellers, are required to be
very strong, and as endurance is of even more consequence
than speed, straight stifles are preferred to
those much bent, as in the Greyhound.

Elbows set quite straight, neither turned in nor
out, are a sine qua non. They must be well let down
by means of the long true arm previously mentioned.

Every Master of Foxhounds insists on legs as
straight as an arrow and very strong; size of bone
at knees and stifles being specially regarded as
important.

Not much attention is paid to colour and coat, so
long as of good Hound colour, and the latter short,
dense, hard and glossy. Typical Hound colours are:
black, white and tan (tricolour), black and white and
the various "pies," compounded of white and the
colours of the hare and badger, or yellow and tan.

In some old strains the "blue mottle" of the[120]
Southern Hound is still preserved. The stern is
gently arched, coming gaily over the back and
slightly fringed with hair below. It should taper
to a point. The symmetry of the Foxhound is considerable,
and what is called "quality" is highly
regarded by all Hound judges. Dogs ought to weigh
70 to 80 lbs. and bitches from 60 to 70 lbs.

As to height, this varies in accordance with the
country over which the Hounds have to hunt. From
22 up to 26 inches, but between these heights is
general.

It is a very old custom to crop the young Hounds'
ears with scissors, the operation being known as
"rounding". It is done with the object of preventing
the ears from becoming lacerated by briars, etc.

Recently there has been a good deal of discussion
as to the necessity for a continuance of this practice,
many asserting that it is not necessary, and constitutes
cruelty.

As to the cruelty, there can be no two opinions.

The Kennel Club put their veto on the cropping of
Bull-terriers, Black-and-tan Terriers, Boarhounds,
etc., and there is little doubt that in course of time
small ears will be the result. The old type of Foxhound
had very much bigger ears than the modern one.

All things considered, the author is of opinion that
the time has arrived for total abolition of this
cruel operation.

Harriers

Although there are packs of Harriers in various
parts of the country, they are of a very limited
number, hare-hunting with Hounds being a very
inferior sport to that of fox-hunting. Moreover,
hares are not as plentiful as in the days of our forefathers,
in a large measure arising through diminished
agricultural industry and commercial relations.

That good sport is still to be had with Harriers we
do not for a moment dispute, but it is not general.

Formerly "dwarf" foxhounds were used for hare-hunting,
though proved not to be equal to the typical
Harrier for this purpose.

Harriers vary in their height according to the
nature of the country they have to work in.

[123]


     
     Lecturer&mdash;A Member of the Crickhowell Harriers.


[124][125]

From 16 to 20 inches is the general height,
sometimes a trifle more, or less.

Unless very carefully trained, Harriers will hunt
rabbits, and then they are with difficulty broken of
this vice.

The most useful colour is black, white and tan
(tricolour), but hare, red, tan, badger and yellow pies
are frequent.

Throughout, the Harrier should be symmetrical,
have a large nose, dilated nostrils, ears low set on
and lying close to the cheeks, and the neck long and
strong. A short neck is a defective one.

There must be no loose skin, such as dewlap, etc.,
in this region.

Elbows well let down and carried in the same line
as body.

Loins.&mdash;Broad; and back straight, strong, and wide.

Back ribs.&mdash;Deep.

Chest.&mdash;Deep, but not wide.

Fore-limbs.&mdash;Straight as a line, well rounded and
of good bone and substance. Feet must be hard and
compact.

Strong hind-quarters, and a gay carriage of tail are
typical of a well-built Harrier.

Coat.&mdash;Dense, smooth (not coarse), and glossy.

Twenty couples were considered by the late Peter
Beckford as constituting a full pack of Harriers,
though there is no fixed number for this purpose.

[126]

Our illustration represents one of the Crickhowell
Harriers, and for the picture I am indebted to Mr
Stanhope Lovell of Crickhowell.[3]

The Otterhound

Otter-hunting is a very ancient sport, otter dogs
being used during the reign of King John.

The Hounds in those days had not the beauty of
the present-day Otterhound, as very different types
of dogs were then used, e.g., a cross-bred Terrier, Foxhounds,
etc.

One of the best packs of Otterhounds in this
country are those belonging to the Dumfriesshire
otter-hunt, the River Tweed affording the pack excellent
hunting ground. It is an old-established pack,
and has always given, we believe, the best of sport.

Looking at a typical specimen of this breed, one is
not slow to recognise a "workman all over."

To a casual observer he has the appearance of a
rough-coated&mdash;if such there can be&mdash;Bloodhound.

These dogs weigh from about 65 to 80 or 90 lbs.,
and the bitch Hounds 10 or 15 lbs. less, and of different
colours, but grizzle (black and grey), and tan is the
most general.

Colour.&mdash;Fawn, yellow, blue and white and black-and-tan[127]
are frequently seen. The last-named colour
should not be encouraged in these Hounds.

White markings are common.

His coat should be dense, of a wiry texture, shaggy
in appearance, and of a water-resisting nature.

When judging these dogs, particular attention is
paid to the coat.

A soft coat is decidedly objectionable, so is one that
is thin.

Height.&mdash;About 25 inches.

Eyes.&mdash;Deeply sunk, thoughtful, showing the
"haw" plainly.

Ears.&mdash;Long and sweeping, hanging closely to the
cheeks.

Skull.&mdash;The peak is less prominent than that of
the Bloodhound and the head shorter, but the flews
large and loose. Like the ears, it is covered by shaggy
hair, softer than that on the body. Beneath the
lower jaw there is a moustache. Large teeth and
powerful jaws are indispensable in an encounter with
an otter.

Of Foxhound-like conformation, the frame is of
stouter build altogether.

Neck.&mdash;Thick, of medium length, ending in very
powerful shoulders and arms, and the chest must be
deep, running and swimming demanding a sound
heart and lungs. Dewlap loose. A strong back and
loins, the latter slightly arched, an additional qualification[128]
of the breed. Should be shorter in the leg
than a Foxhound, but have big-boned, muscular
limbs, with large feet, close, and horny below.

These Hounds hunt both by scent and by sight,
their scenting-power being developed to a remarkable
degree.

The music of Otterhounds is rich, deep and
mellow.


The Deerhound


     


Regarding the origin of the Scottish Deerhound
there is very little
reliable information,
though there
can be no questioning
the fact
that it is a variety
of dog indigenous
to the Highlands,
and bred specially
for the purpose of
hunting the deer.

About forty-five
years since there
were not many of these Hounds in England, and even
in their native land at, or about, this period, they
were by no means common.

[129]

Although powerful and swift dogs, they are only
used to a very limited extent, and breeders of
these Hounds keep them more for companionship,
and exhibition purposes.

They make excellent watch-dogs, and are exceedingly
hardy.

The following description is that issued by the
Deerhound Club:&mdash;

Head.&mdash;The head should be broadest at the ears,
tapering slightly to the eyes, with the muzzle
tapering more decidedly to the nose.

The muzzle to be pointed, but the teeth and lips level.

The head ought to be long, the skull flat, rather
than round, with a very slight rise over the eyes,
but with nothing approaching a "stop."

The skull should be coated with moderately long
hair, which is softer than the rest of the coat.

The nose to be black (although in some blue fawns
the colour is blue) and slightly aquiline.

In the lighter coloured dogs a black muzzle is
preferred. There should be a good moustache of
rather silky hair and a fair beard.

Ears.&mdash;These to be set on "high," and in repose
folded back like those of the Greyhound, though
raised above the head during excitement without
losing the fold, and, in some cases, semi-erect.

A "prick" ear is bad.

A big, thick ear hanging flat to the head, or[130]
heavily coated with long hair, is one of the worst
faults. The ear should be soft, glossy and like a
mouse's coat to the touch, and the smaller it is, the
better. It should have no long coat or long fringe,
but there is often a silky, silvery coat on the body of
the ear and the tip.

Whatever the general colour, the ears ought to be
black, or dark coloured.

Neck and Shoulders.&mdash;The neck should be long&mdash;that
is, of the length that befits the Greyhound
character of the dog.

An overlong neck is neither necessary nor desirable,
for the dog is not required to stoop to his work
like a Greyhound, and it must be remembered that
the mane, which every good specimen should have,
detracts from the apparent length of the neck.

Moreover, a Deerhound requires a very strong
neck to hold a stag.

The nape of the neck must be very prominent
where the head is set on, and the throat clean cut
at the angle, and prominent.

Shoulders to be of good slope and blades well back.
Loaded and straight shoulders are faulty ones.

Stern.&mdash;To be tolerably long, tapering and reaching
to within 1½ inches of the ground, and about the
same distance below hocks.

When the Hound is at rest, tail ought to be quite
straight down, or curved.

[131]


     
     Deerhound Champion St Ronan's Rhyme (Property of
Mr Harry Rawson).


[132][133]


     
     Deerhound Dog Champion Selwood Morven (Property of Mr Harry Rawson).


[134][135]

During excitement, curved, and in no case lifted
out of the line of the back.

It should be well covered with hair on the
inside, thick and woolly, underside longer, and a
slight fringe near tip not objectionable. A curl or
ring tail very faulty.

Eyes.&mdash;These should be dark; generally they are
dark brown or hazel. A very light eye is not liked.
The eye is moderately full, with a soft look during
repose, but a keen, far-away expression when the
Hound is roused. Rims of eyelids ought to be black.

Body.&mdash;The body and general formation is that
of a Greyhound, of larger size and bone.

Chest deep, rather than broad, but not too narrow,
and flat-sided. The loin well arched, and drooping
to the tail. A straight back is not desirable, this
formation being unsuitable for uphill work, and
very unsightly.

Legs and Feet.&mdash;The legs to be broad and flat, with
good broad forearms and elbows.

Straight fore-limbs, and close compact feet.

The hind-quarters to be drooping, and as broad and
powerful as possible, the hips being set wide apart.

The hind-legs to be well bent at the stifle, with
great length from hips to hocks, and the latter
broad and flat.

Cow-hocks, weak pasterns, straight stifles, and
splay feet are the worst of faults.

[136]

Coat.&mdash;The hair on the body, neck, and quarters
should be hard and wiry, and about 3 or 4
inches in length, and that on the head, breast, and
belly much softer. There ought to be a slight hairy
fringe on the inside of the fore and hind legs, but
nothing approaching the feather of a Collie.

The Deerhound ought to be a shaggy dog, but not
overcoated. A woolly coat is a bad one.

Some good strains have a mixture of silky coat
with the hard, and this is preferable to a woolly coat.
The proper Deerhound coat is thick, close-lying,
ragged, and harsh or crisp to the feel.

Colour.&mdash;More a matter for individual fancy.

A dark blue-grey most preferred, and after this,
darker and lighter grey, or brindles, the darkest
being preferred.

Yellow, sandy-red, or red-fawn, with black points
(i.e., ears and muzzle), are equally esteemed, more so
because two of the oldest strains&mdash;the M'Neil and
Chesthill Menzies&mdash;are of these colours.

White is condemned by all the old authorities, but
a white chest and white toes, occurring as they do in
a great many of the darkest coloured dogs, are not so
much objected to, though less the better, as the
Deerhound is a self-coloured dog.

A white blaze on the head, or a white collar,
should entirely disqualify.

A white tip on tail occurs in most strains.

[137]

Height of Dogs.&mdash;From 28 to 30 inches.

Height of Bitches.&mdash;From 26 inches upwards.

A big bitch is better for breeding and keeping up
size. Ought not to exceed the height of the dog
under any circumstances.

Weight.&mdash;Dogs, 85 to 105 lbs. Bitches, 65 to 80
lbs.

photographs.

[140][141]



CHAPTER IX

The Bloodhound

For several centuries at least, the Bloodhound has
existed as a distinct variety of the canine race.
According to Jesse, the earliest mention of Bloodhounds
was during the reign of Henry III., and that
the breed originated from the Talbot, brought over
by William the Conqueror, and very similar to a
breed from St Hubert's Abbey and Ardennes, which,
according to the old legends, was imported by St
Hubert, from the south of Gaul, about the sixth
century.

The Talbot was the popular Hound from the twelfth
to the sixteenth century, becoming extinct about the
end of the last century.

"The Southern Hound, another very old breed,
showing many characteristics of the Bloodhound, is
difficult to find now in his pure state, although many
old packs of Harriers have descended chiefly from
Southern Hounds. The best authorities agree that
the St Hubert, Talbot, and Bloodhound are all closely
allied."

[142]

The foregoing is an extract from the Century, by
E. Brough.

These Hounds were used by Henry VIII. in the
wars in France; by the Spaniards in Mexico, and by
Queen Elizabeth against the Irish.

One of the most remarkable features of the Bloodhound
is found in his abilities to track the footsteps
of strangers, but in towns and cities he is quite
useless for this purpose.

Within recent years, these Hounds have frequently
been employed with the object of tracking a criminal,
and in some instances, we believe, with very satisfactory
results.

In appearance the Bloodhound has a very stately
bearing, and usually of a kindly disposition.

On the hunt their music is deep and bell-like.

Although generally of good constitution, Bloodhound
puppies are very troublesome to rear, distemper
being the scourge to which most of them
succumb.

For the photograph of the beautiful quartet, the
author is indebted to Mrs Chapman of Thrapston,
and to this lady, and Mr Fall for the lovely picture
of the head of Champion Sultan.

The points of the Bloodhound are as follows:&mdash;

1. Head.&mdash;This is characteristic.

The skin covering the forehead and cheeks is
heavily wrinkled, the more so the better. Reference
to the picture showing the head of Sultan shows the
remarkable expression in this region.

[143]


     
     A Quartet of Typical Bloodhounds (the Property of Mrs Chapman,
Thrapston).


[144][145]

The occipital dome is high but not wide, and very
round. At the top it forms a peak.

The nasal surface, i.e., from eyes to nose, is very long,
so that from peak to nose it may measure as much
as a foot. The brows are prominent; the flews very
long&mdash;sometimes a couple of inches&mdash;and the nostrils
large and well dilated.

Eyes.&mdash;Small, hazel in colour, deeply sunk, and
should show a great deal of "haw," i.e., the membrana
nictitans, or third eyelid. These features are very
characteristic of the Bloodhound.

Long ears, thin, soft to the feel, set on low down,
hanging close to cheeks, and meeting, when pulled
together, over the nose.

The facial expression ought to appear quick and
penetrating.

2. Legs and Feet.&mdash;There must be plenty of bone
and muscle here; strong knees; straight and round
well-formed, cat-like feet.

3. Chest and Shoulders.&mdash;Width and fair depth are
desirable, the shoulder being very strong, the arm
also strong.

4. Neck.&mdash;A long neck is essential, and the dewlap
should be well developed.

5. Ribs, Back and Loin.&mdash;Well-sprung ribs, with a
wide back, of moderate length, and strong loins.

[146]

6. Hind-quarters and Limbs.&mdash;There should not
be much more than skin, bone, and muscle in these
regions. The hocks are strong and coarse. Must not
be cow-hocked.

7. Tail.&mdash;Gay carriage as in other Hounds. At
rest tail is down.

8. Coat and Colour.&mdash;Black-and-tan. The black
hair is generally blended with the tan, and this ought
to be of a deep red. Some Hounds are tan-coloured
only. Lion colour uncommon, but coveted. The body
coat short and hard, but on the ears, and head, fine
and soft.

Height.&mdash;For dogs, about 2 ft. 3 in.; bitches, 2 ft.
(measured at shoulder).

Club.&mdash;Bloodhound Breeders' Association, particulars
of this being given.

Irish Wolfhounds

The present breed of Irish Wolfhounds appears
to be the outcome of crossing the Deerhound with
the Boarhound, though several centuries ago this
variety of dog was said to be in existence, and
employed, as its name indicates, for hunting the
wolves in this and his own country.

The extermination of wolves in these countries
would naturally account for the decadence of the
Hounds hunting them.

Be this as it may, the present type of Hound is a
fast and powerful dog, and, we should judge, would
prove to be quite equal to his earlier representatives.

In colour these Hounds are red, brindle, fawn, grey,
black, white, etc., and have a rough, hard coat on
body, head and limbs, the hair under the jaw and
over the eyes, being long, and wiry in texture.

[156]

Weight, height (proportionate), and powerful build
are essentials, and should be one of the principal
aims of the breeder.

Dogs ought not to be less than 31 inches, and bitches
28 inches. In weight, the former ought to scale 120
lbs. and bitches about 100 lbs.

Head.&mdash;Must be long, of medium width above the
eyes, and the muzzle long and pointed.

Ears.&mdash;Small.

Neck.&mdash;Ought to be well curved, long, and deep.

A deep chest, wide brisket, and long, strong back
and loins, together with a long curved tail, having an
abundance of hair upon it, are qualifications for a
typical specimen.

Fore-limbs.&mdash;Strong, big-boned forearms , straight
and carried straight, ending in large round feet
and strong claws, are essentials of beauty in these
regions.

Hind-quarters.&mdash;To be clothed with well-developed
muscles&mdash;weakness in this respect being a fault&mdash;having
a long second thigh, and hocks low placed.

In many respects the Irish Wolfhound resembles
the Russian Wolfhound, our own Deerhound and
Greyhound, though it is a more massive animal than
any of these, but like these Hounds, built upon racing
lines, though of the heavy-weight class.

The Irish Wolfhound Club watches over the
interests of the breed.

[157]

The Greyhound

From representations upon Egyptian monuments,
etc., the Greyhound has been shown to have been in
existence for three thousand years at least, and,
according to Holinshead, was introduced into Britain
some time during the third century. The first record
of any coursing club in this country is said to be
that founded by Lord Orford in Norfolk, during
1776.

The modern Greyhound is vastly superior to those
of the ancients, if the old prints are faithful representations
of these fleet-coursing thoroughbreds.

Although the Greyhound hunts by "sight," he is
by no means "devoid" of hunting by "scent," as the
Foxhound, Otterhound, etc. Misterton, winner of
the Waterloo Cup in 1879 (63 lbs. weight); Coomassie,
winner of the Waterloo Cup twice (weight
42 lbs.); Master M'Grath, winner of the Waterloo
Cup three times (54 lbs.), and Fullerton (65 lbs.),
winner of the Waterloo Cup three times and a
division of it the fourth time with his kennel companion,
may be said to have been the grandest quartet
of Greyhounds ever gracing the course.

To enter into a detailed account of the Greyhound
would be quite outside the title and scope of this
work, therefore the author will only give a brief outline
of some of the more important points of these
fleet-footed Hounds, which are as follows:&mdash;

[158]

Head.&mdash;This should be long and narrow, wide
between the ears and low between the eyes. The
head of a bitch is of finer mould. Lean jaws.

Eyes.&mdash;Penetrating and full of animation.

Ears.&mdash;Elegantly carried and small.

Neck.&mdash;Very important. Must be long, strong,
very supple, and, above all, graceful. A high degree
of flexibility is indispensable.

Fore-quarters.&mdash;Shoulders must not be over-loaded
with muscle, but a great degree of obliquity is a sine
qua non.

Arm, long, ending below in a strong elbow
joint.

Fore-arm.&mdash;Very long, strong, and should consist
of little beyond bone, muscles and tendons. It is in
this region, particularly, that the Greyhound excels
in beauty. Must be as straight as a line from elbow
to knee, and, above all, well placed in relation to
the parts above and below.

The forward position of the fore-limbs are a striking
feature of the Greyhound, giving a minimum of
weight to carry in front.

Long oblique pasterns, and compact hard feet are
points of great importance.

Hind-quarters.&mdash;Strength, width, and a great
degree of flexibility are necessary in this region.
Weak, or soft muscles destroys a Greyhound's speed,
turning and staying power.

[166][167]

First and second thighs must be long, and well
muscled.

The oblique position of the second thighs constitutes
the main beauty in this region. Their backward curve
joins the hocks in such a manner as to give the
greatest possible leverage on the long, strong, pasterns
and feet below.

The angles of the hocks are very acute, and, in
relation to the body, placed very far back.

If a Greyhound has not typically formed and well-placed
hind-quarters, he will never make his mark as
a runner.

Chest.&mdash;Most certainly should be deep, but not
wide.

If a greyhound is not well-hearted he is no good
for speed, or endurance.

Flatness of ribs, especially towards the keel, is
advantageous.

Tail.&mdash;Long and tapering.

Coat.&mdash;Of medium texture, neither too coarse, nor
too fine.

Colour.&mdash;Unimportant. A good Greyhound may be
any colour.

Our illustrations are from photographs kindly lent
by Mrs Dewè of Ringmer, and Mr Eyers of Blandford.

The Whippet

The Whippet may be described as a miniature Greyhound,[168]
and is judged much upon the same lines. The
chief use of these little dogs is that of racing on a
course, and for rabbiting, also as a snap-dog. It is
rather singular, but miners, etc., are remarkably fond
of Whippets, and the Lancashire and Staffordshire
towns contain a lot of this breed.

This variety of canine flesh resulted through
crossing a Greyhound and Terrier.

The best time of the year to breed Whippets is the
spring, so that the youngsters will have the whole of
the summer to develop in.

For general purposes, from 15 to 18 or 20 lbs. is the
most useful weight, and of either whole, or mixed
colours. Fawn, bramble, blue, red and white are
very common ones.

Coat.&mdash;Should be fine and close.

Constitution.&mdash;Must be sound (otherwise a Whippet
is not the slightest use), and the chest of good capacity,
i.e., the dog ought to be well-hearted. A long, lean,
finely-chiselled head (wide between the eyes), and
flat on the top, with bright, expressive eyes, and
small rose ears, are essentials.

Shoulders should have a good slope; the neck long,
clean, and inclined to be straight, not arched, as
stated by some authorities.

Fore-limbs.&mdash;These must be as straight as a line;
have good bone, be long, have well-developed muscles,
and well placed in relation to the body.

[169]


     
     Typical Whippet Dog Dandy Coon (Property
of Mr Thomas Redruth).


[170][171]

The shoulders long, the arms long, forearms  very
long, and pasterns long, but proportionate.

The loins are very important features in a good
Whippet. This region should show strongly-developed
muscles, be slightly arched, passing in front on to a
broad and square back.

Front ribs to be well rounded and long; the back
ones short.

Hind-quarters, Tail, and Feet.&mdash;If a racing dog is
poorly developed in these regions, he is no use for the
purpose. The outlines of the individual muscles
ought to be plainly seen.

Long first and second thighs are a sine qua non in
the Whippet. Both width and strength are necessary.
Well-bent stifles and strong hocks equally essential.
Feet round, and well split up.

Tail.&mdash;Long, tapered, and nicely curved.

General Appearance of the Whippet.&mdash;A smart,
racily-built, active-looking dog, of various colours,
having a deep chest, narrow waist, and long, beautifully
modelled, muscular extremities.

[178][179]



CHAPTER X

The Borzois or Russian Wolfhound

The Borzois appears to be unquestionably of
Russian origin, being, in anatomical structure,
closely allied to the Greyhound, and in his native
country is used for hunting the wolf, a brace being
"slipped" after the wolf has been beaten out of cover,
much in the same fashion as Greyhounds' coursing.
The Hounds retain their hold until the huntsman
arrives to secure it.

Russian Wolfhounds have during recent years
become remarkably fashionable in England, probably
in a large measure owing to the fact that Queen
Alexandra, the Duchess of Newcastle&mdash;who owns
some of the finest specimens of the breed in this
country&mdash;and many others of aristocratic lineage,
have been keen supporters of these noble creatures.
In England, the only use for these hounds is that of
companionship. They are, when trained, fairly good
house dogs, though the uncertain temper of many
of these Hounds renders them not very reliable.
Although always carrying a most benignant expression,
this will often be found to be deceptive.

[180]

A typical Borzoi should have a long, lean head;
flat and narrow skull, and long, tapering muzzle, the
head of the bitch being somewhat finer than that of
the dog.

Greyhound-like ears, and dark, elliptically-shaped
eyes.

Chest, narrow and deep, with great depth of rib
behind the elbows, one of the most striking features
of the breed.

Neck, very muscular, rather long and deep where
it joins the shoulders, and these ought to be fairly
oblique, but well clothed with muscles.

A long, straight back and broad loins, with powerful
quarters, long thighs and low-placed, strong hocks
are counted points for the show bench. The hind
limbs, in relation to the body, are placed very far
back, only just appearing to be under it at the lower
part of the extremities when the dog is standing still.

Tail must be heavily feathered, long, and carried
down, the so-called "gay" carriage being a drawback.

Fore-Limbs.&mdash;Good fore-limbs are a sine qua non.
The arms should be well muscled, and the forearms
long, straight, broadening out as they approach the
arms, and tapering from a trifle above the knees until
the feet are reached. These ought to be long, toes
well arched, and close.

Colour.&mdash;Grey, or orange patches on a white
ground.

[181]

Coat.&mdash;Short and smooth on the head, ears, and
fore-limbs. The frill on neck should be abundant
and somewhat curly. That covering the head, body,
tail, and hind-quarters, long and silky.

Height.&mdash;Dogs from 28 inches, and bitches from 26
inches.

Faults.&mdash;A drooping nose; sickle-shaped carriage
of the tail, short back, weak forehand, etc.

Club.&mdash;The Borzoi, formed in 1892.

The Beagle

This is a very ancient variety of sporting dog, and
one that was much in favour during the Elizabethan
period, these miniature Hounds even at that time
being spoken of as the "merry, singing Beagles."

The typical Beagle is a modification of the Foxhound,
and has every appearance of having been
derived, by selection, from this source.

Just as the Foxhound is used for hunting the fox,
the Harrier for hunting the hare, so is the Beagle
employed for rabbit-hunting&mdash;hence the term "Rabbit
Beagles," of which there are many small packs of these
splendid little creatures up and down this, and other
countries sometimes used for hare-hunting.

The smaller ones&mdash;Pocket Beagles in particular&mdash;are
lovely little Hounds, and to the sportsman who[182]
loves hunting on foot, they are ideal field companions.

Typical specimens of the breed are, in our opinion,
handsome; their symmetrical form and workmanlike
appearance carry an irresistible charm into the heart
of the rabbit-hunter.

There is also the Rough-coated Beagle, and for these
a class is usually provided at the Kennel Club and
Cruft shows, in London.

In order to breed Pocket Beagles it is advisable to
select as small a sire and dam as possible, because
there seems to be a natural tendency for these Hounds
to become over, rather than under, sized.

By instinct, the Beagle seems to take to work.

Taking puppies out along with a "schoolmaster"
or "mistress" will generally be sufficient education,
if carried out in systematic lessons.

These Hounds are, as a rule, quiet and affectionate,
and some are not at all bad house dogs, though, of
course, this is quite outside the uses for which they
have been designed.

When purchasing Beagles, more especially for
work, there are several important matters to look to.

Buy Hounds having a dense, rather coarse coat;
short, strong, upright pasterns, cat-like feet, short
back, heavily muscled on the quarters and second
thighs, and well-hearted, i.e., a deep chest and well-sprung
ribs.

     Pocket Beagle Cheerful of Rodnance (Property of Mrs Oughton Giles).


[186][187]

Good coupling is essential.

Long ears, low set on, fine, and hanging close to
cheek are additional points of beauty.

The classes at the London Kennel Club shows
are:&mdash;


1. Not exceeding 10 inches.
2. Not exceeding 12 inches.
3. Over 10 but not over 12 inches.
4. Over 12 but not over 16 inches.
5. In the Novice Class&mdash;any height.
6. Class for Rough Coats.

The following descriptions and standards of points
will afford the reader the best information upon the
subject, but as the English and American standards
differ somewhat in details, the author deems it advisable
to insert the descriptions framed by both clubs.


1. ENGLISH BEAGLE CLUB

Description and Standard of Points

Head.&mdash;Of fair length, powerful, without being
coarse, skull domed, moderately wide, with an indication
of peak, "stop" well defined, muzzle not snipy,
and lips well flewed.

Nose.&mdash;Black, broad, and nostrils well-expanded.

Eyes.&mdash;Brown, dark hazel or hazel, not deep-set or
bulgy, and with a mild expression.

[188]

Ears.&mdash;Long, set on low, fine in texture, and hanging
in a graceful fold close to the cheek.

Neck.&mdash;Moderately long, slightly arched, and throat
showing some dewlap.

Shoulders.&mdash;Clean and slightly sloping.

Body.&mdash;Short between the couplings, well let down
in chest, ribs fairly well sprung and well ribbed up,
with powerful, and not tucked-up loins.

Hind-quarters.&mdash;Very muscular about the thighs,
stifles and hocks well bent, the latter well let down.

Forelegs.&mdash;Quite straight, well under the dog, of
good substance and round in bone; feet round, well
knuckled up, and strongly padded.

Stern.&mdash;Of moderate length, set on high, carried
gaily, but not curled over the back.

Colour.&mdash;Any recognised Hound colour.

Coat.&mdash;Smooth variety: smooth, very dense, and
not too fine or short. Rough variety: very dense

Height.&mdash;Not exceeding 16 inches.

General Appearance.&mdash;A compactly-built Hound,
without coarseness, conveying the impression of great
stamina and activity.

Pocket Beagles must not exceed 10 inches in
height, although ordinary Beagles in miniature. No
point, however good in itself, should be encouraged,
if it tends to give a coarse appearance to such minute
specimens of the breed. They should be compact[189]
and symmetrical throughout, of true Beagle type, and
show great quality and breeding.

Classification.&mdash;It is recommended that Beagles
should be divided at shows into Rough and Smooth,
with classes for "not exceeding 16 inches and over
12 inches"; "not exceeding 12 inches and over 10";
and "not exceeding 10 inches."

(It is permissible to remove the dewclaws.)

[190]

2. AMERICAN BEAGLE CLUB

Points, &amp;c.

Head.&mdash;The skull should be moderately domed at
the occiput, with the cranium broad and full. The ears
set on low, long, and fine in texture, the forward or
front edge closely framing and inturned to the cheek,
rather broad and rounded at the tips, with an almost
entire absence of erectile power at their origin.

Eyes.&mdash;The eyes full and prominent, rather wide
apart, soft and lustrous, brown or hazel in colour.
The orbital processes well developed. The expression
gentle, subdued, and pleading.

Muzzle.&mdash;The muzzle of medium length, squarely
cut, the "stop" well defined. The jaws should be level.
Lips either free from, or with moderate, flews.
Nostrils large, moist, and open.

Defects.&mdash;A flat skull, narrow across the top of
head, absence of dome. Ears short, set on too high;
or when the dog is excited, rising above the line of
the skull at their points of origin, due to an excess of
erectile power. Ears pointed at tips, thick or boardy
in substance, or carried out from cheek, showing a
space between. Eyes of a light or yellow colour.
Muzzle long and snipy. Pig jaws, or the reverse,
known as undershot. Lips showing deep, pendulous
flews.

[191]

Disqualifications.&mdash;Eyes close together, small,
beady, and Terrier-like.

Neck and Throat.&mdash;Neck rising free and light from
the shoulders, strong in substance, yet not loaded;
of medium length. The throat clean, and free from
folds of skin; a slight wrinkle below the angle of the
jaw, however, may be allowable.

Defects.&mdash;A thick, short, cloddy neck carried on a
line with the top of the shoulders. Throat showing
dewlap and folds of skin to a degree termed
"throatiness."

Shoulders and Chest.&mdash;Shoulders somewhat declining,
muscular, but not loaded, conveying the idea
of freedom of action with lightness, activity, and
strength. Chest moderately broad and full.

Defects.&mdash;Upright shoulders and a disproportionately
wide chest.

Back, Loins, and Ribs.&mdash;Back short, muscular, and
strong. Loin broad and slightly arched, and the
ribs well sprung, giving abundant lung-room.

Defects.&mdash;A long or swayed back, a flat, narrow
loin, or a flat, constricted rib.

Forelegs and Feet.&mdash;Forelegs straight, with plenty
of bone. Feet close, firm, and either round or hare-like
in form.

Defects.&mdash;Cow-hocks and open feet.

Tail.&mdash;The tail should be carried gaily, well up,
and with some medium curve, rather short as compared[192]
with the size of the dog, and clothed with a
decided brush.

Defects.&mdash;A long tail, with a "tea-pot" curve.

Disqualifications.&mdash;A thinly-haired, rattish tail,
with entire absence of brush.

Coat.&mdash;Moderately coarse in texture, and of good
length.

Disqualifications.&mdash;A short, close, and nappy coat.

Height.&mdash;The meaning of the term "Beagle" (a
word of Celtic origin, and in Old English, "Begele") is
small, little. The dog was so named from his diminutive
size. Your Committee, therefore, for the sake of
consistency, and that the Beagle shall be in fact what
his name implies, strongly recommend that the height
line shall be sharply drawn at 15 inches, and that all
dogs exceeding that height shall be disqualified as
overgrown and outside the pale of recognition.

Colour.&mdash;All Hound colours are admissible. Perhaps
the most popular is black, white and tan. Next
in order is the lemon and white, the blue and lemon
mottles; then follow the solid colours, such as black-and-tan,
tan, lemon, fawn, etc. This arrangement is
of course arbitrary, the question being one governed
entirely by fancy. The colours first named form the
most lively contrast, and blend better in the pack, the
solid colours being sombre and monotonous to the
eye. It is not intended to give a point value to colour
in the scale for judging, as beforesaid all true[193]
Hound colours being correct. The following remarks
on the subject are therefore simply suggestive.

General Appearance.&mdash;A miniature Foxhound,
solid and big for his inches, with the wear-and-tear
look of the dog that can last in the chase and follow
his quarry to the death.

Note.&mdash;Dogs possessing such serious faults as are
enumerated under the heading of "Disqualifications"
are under the grave suspicion of being of impure
blood. Under the heading of "Defects," objectionable
features are indicated, such departures from the
standard not, however, impugning the purity of the
breeding.





[194]



CHAPTER XI

The Dachshund


     


Like many other
varieties of the dog, the
origin of the Dachshund
seems to be involved in
obscurity, though there
are fairly reasonable
grounds for concluding
that the home of the
Dachshund is Germany,
where the terrier-like
type is that cultivated,
the Hound characteristics of the breed having become
largely developed through the English system of
breeding.

To anyone unacquainted with this breed of dog in
his own country, the Hound features are the most
striking, in fact, so overshadow anything of the
Terrier element as to completely obscure it.

Some few years since the Dachshund was an exceedingly
fashionable variety of dog, chiefly as a
lady's companion.

[202][203]

Latterly he seems to have been displaced by the
Pomeranian, Pekinese, and Japanese Spaniels. This
brings us back to the adage that "every dog has his
day." So with the Dachshund, yet the classes at the
London shows are always well filled. The Terrier-type
of Hound is usually smaller and built upon
lighter lines. The legs are not so crooked, the head
shorter, so are the ears.

In weight they are from 10 to 16 lbs. or thereabout.

The so-called Toy Dachshund or Spiel Dachs are a
diminutive production of the smallest Terrier-type
of the variety, but not specially sought after, at least
in this country.

In England Dachshunds are but rarely used for
sporting purposes, but in Germany they are largely
employed for hunting the fox in his home.

These little dogs can go into the earth after any
fox, and are not long in giving tongue when Reynard
is in the ground, and if several of these little dogs are
at work on one fox they are not long in causing him
to bolt, or settle the dispute by underground combat.
With the badger&mdash;always a formidable antagonist&mdash;these
little dogs are said to be equally game, usually
fighting to a finish. A few sportsmen have made
use of Dachshunds for driving rabbits out of cover,
but they have no particular qualification in this
respect, and are decidedly inferior to the Beagle, or a
pack of Beagles for this purpose.

[204]

It is a variety of dog not the easiest to rear, distemper
being, as in most other breeds, accountable
for the high mortality amongst them.

The colour of Dachshunds varies considerably, but
the chief ones are, deep red, chocolate and tan, fallow-red,
black-and-tan, and dapple.

White on the body is objectionable, less so on the
feet.

The so-called "Tiger Dachs," or steel-blue and tan-colour
is uncommon, though it gives the animal a
very handsome appearance. At the London Kennel
Club shows there is a class for dappled dogs and
bitches. As a rule, the crossing of a black-and-tan
Dachs with a red one, produces puppies true to type,
i.e., some are black and tan, others red, and not a
mixture of these two colours. A red dog and bitch,
will, however, sometimes throw a black-and-tan
puppy; or a black-and-tan sire and dam produce a
whole-red puppy. This is precisely what happens
with certain other varieties.

There are really three varieties of coat, viz.:&mdash;

(a) The Smooth.
(b) The Rough.
(c) Wire-haired.

The coat should be short and thick and the skin
remarkably loose&mdash;a characteristic feature of the
breed, and one that undoubtedly affords the animal a
degree of protection during combat.

[205]

Head.&mdash;This is distinctly wedge-shaped and large
in proportion to the size of the animal. Jaws
strong.

Nose.&mdash;Black or Dudley (flesh) coloured. A red
dog may have a black nose.

Eyes.&mdash;Well apart, with brown or black iris.

Ears.&mdash;These ought to be long, thin, covered by
silky short hair and free from scales.

Neck.&mdash;Short and thick.

Chest.&mdash;Wide and deep, almost touching ground.

Shoulders.&mdash;The shoulders are very prominent and
heavily clad with muscle, giving the dog a square
appearance in front. A long body and well-rounded
ribs are essentials.

Legs, Feet and Toes.&mdash;Most important. The forearm
should be short and thick, running inwards so
as to form almost right angles with the parts below.
At the wrists or knees the parts touch each other
and almost immediately bend outwards (splay-feet),
as long, flat paws. These latter ought to be large
and shovel-shaped, bearing long, strong, slightly-hooked
claws of a black or brown colour, a white
claw (as in Pugs) being objectionable. The more the
"crook" the better. This, with well-rounded ribs
and a long body, constitutes one of the chief points
in a Dachshund, giving it a well-let-down appearance,
but not too low.

Hind-quarters.&mdash;Strength in this region is of great[206]
importance, the croup being well-rounded and the
thighs strong. The loins must be well arched. The
tail thick and tapering, and carried like that of the
Foxhound under excitement. It must not curl over
the back, this being one of the worst faults a
Dachshund can have.

From 17 to 22 lbs. is the average weight of dogs in
fair condition.

The Dachshund Club, and the Northern Dachshund
Association, are the two principal societies,
in this country, presiding over the interests of the
breed.

The service of A1 stud dogs can be had at fees from
two to four guineas, and excellent youngsters obtained
from three to ten or twelve guineas.

The Basset-hound

This is said to be a very ancient variety of dog,
having existed in France for several centuries. In
France the term "Basset" is frequently employed to
indicate any crooked-legged variety of dog, being
synonymous with the English word "Terrier" and the
German "Dachs." Consequently the word "Basset,"
when applied to a dog in France, may become a very
ambiguous one. There are Rough and Smooth-coated
strains of Basset-hounds, but the Smooth-coated[207]
are the most popular varieties, and most of
the Hounds shown at the Kennel Club shows are of
the Smooth-coated variety, although this useful canine
body provides a class for Rough-coated ones in
addition. The Smooth-coated Basset had his origin
in the province of Artois, whilst the Rough-coated
variety came from Flanders. Although there are
the crooked, half-crooked, and straight-legged Bassets
in both Rough and Smooth coats, the only one of
interest in this country is that having the full-crook
of leg.

The late Mr Everett Millais brought the breed into
prominence in England in 1874, through the importation
of a famous Basset, called Model.

He purchased this hound at the Jardin d'Acclimation
in Paris.

This animal was the foundation-stone of the
Basset as he appears in England at the present
day.

The late Mr G. R. Krehl did much towards the improvement
of the breed, and later, many other
enthusiastic admirers, none more so than Mrs Tottie.

The scenting powers of these dogs are said to be
exceptional, and many prefer them to Beagles for
rabbiting, their deep, clear musical notes telling one
exactly of their whereabouts. Most of these Hounds
are exceedingly sweet-tempered, though rather
troublesome to rear.

[208]

In height they are from 9 to 12 inches at shoulder,
but 12 inches is a desirable height, and about 40 lbs.
weight.

Colour.&mdash;The most popular one is the tricolour,
viz., white body with black markings and a tan-coloured
head. Many varieties of white and black
and tan.

Coat.&mdash;Glossy, smooth and close, but the hair
must be hard enough to make the jacket fairly
waterproof.

Head.&mdash;Taken as a whole in the Smooth-coated
variety, the head has the expression not unlike
that of a Bloodhound, chiefly owing to the high
peak, deeply-set eyes, exposed "haw" and close
carriage of the ears at their set-on . This expression
of face is, however, overshadowed in the Rough-coated
variety, the Airedale or Otterhound being
more in evidence in this region.

In the Smooth-coated variety there is often a very
weird expression on the face, and one that betokens a
good-natured animal. Head must be long, have a
good peak (no "stop"), and be rather narrow, but no
snipy appearance. A typical head and ears, a good
front and long body are, in short, the principal
beauties of the Basset, and points of vital importance
in judging the breed. A black nose, strong
teeth, good long cheeks (flews as they are called),
and a long, strong jaw with large, long, velvety
ears, complete the beauties in the region of the
head.

Fore-quarters and Chest.&mdash;Viewed from the front
and in profile, this region is powerfully built, the
chest nearly touching the ground, the shoulders
short and muscular, arm very short, with a short,
stoutly-made forearm, turning in at the knee.
From the wrist (knee) the parts below turn outwards,
so as to give the Hound a very splay-footed
appearance.


     
     Typical Rough-coated Basset Dog.


The back is long, somewhat hollow, rising slightly[226]
at the loins to the top of the croup, and from this
very powerful muscles should spring. Weak hind-quarters
are a serious defect. Well-rounded ribs and
plenty of loose skin, especially over the tops of the
shoulders and back, are desirable qualifications for
the show ring.

Our illustration represents one of the most typical
Basset-hound bitches ever seen.

Club.&mdash;The Basset Society.

Rules of the Basset-hound Club.

Basset-hounds, to define precisely, and publish a
description of the true type; to urge the adoption
of such type on breeders, exhibitors, judges, dog-show
committees and others, as the only recognised
and unvarying standard by which Basset-hounds
should be judged, and which may in future be
uniformly accepted as the standard of excellence in
breeding, and in awarding prizes of merit in Basset-hounds:
and by giving prizes, supporting and
originating shows, and taking other steps to do all[227]
in its power to protect and advance the interests of
the breed.

3. That the Club compile a correct Stud Book for
dogs and bitches, containing the names and pedigrees,
as far as can be ascertained, of all pure-bred Basset-hounds,
and keep a register of the birth of pure-bred

General Appearance

1. To begin with, the head is the most distinguishing
part of all breeds. The head of the Basset-hound
is most perfect when it closest resembles a
Bloodhound's. It is long and narrow, with heavy
flews, occiput prominent, "la bosse de la chasse," and
forehead wrinkled to the eyes, which should be kind,
and show the haw. The general appearance of the
head must present high breeding and reposeful
dignity; the teeth are small, and the upper jaw
sometimes protrudes. This is not a fault, and is
called the "bec de lievre."

2. The ears are very long, and when drawn forward[234]
folding well over the nose&mdash;so long, that in
hunting they will often actually tread on them; they
are set on low, and hang loose in folds like drapery,
the ends inward curling, in texture thin and velvety.

3. The neck is powerful, with heavy dewlaps.
Elbows must not turn out. The chest is deep, full,
and framed like a "man-of-war." Body long and low.

4. Forelegs short, about 4 inches, and close-fitting
to the chest till the crooked knee, from where the
wrinkled ankle ends in a massive paw, each toe
standing out distinctly.

5. The stifles are bent, and the quarters full of
muscle, which stands out, so that when one looks at
the dog from behind it gives him a round barrel-like
effect. This, with their peculiar waddling gait, goes
a long way towards Basset character&mdash;a quality
easily recognised by the judge, and as desirable as
Terrier character in a Terrier.

6. The stern is coarse underneath, and carried
Hound-fashion.

7. The coat is short, smooth and fine, and has a
gloss on it like that of a racehorse. (To get this
appearance, they should be hound-gloved, never
brushed.) Skin loose and elastic.

8. The colour should be black, white and tan; the
head, shoulders, and quarters a rich tan, and black
patches on the back. They are also sometimes hare-pied.

General Appearance

1. The head should be large, the skull narrow but
of good length, the peak well developed. The muzzle
should be strong, and the jaws long and powerful: a
snipy muzzle and weakness of jaw are objectionable.
The eyes should be dark and not prominent. The
ears should be set on low, of good length and fine
texture.

2. The neck should be strong, of good length and
muscular, set on sloping shoulders.

3. The body should be massive, of good length and
well ribbed up, any weakness or slackness of loin
being a bad fault. The chest should be large and
very deep, the sternum prominent.

4. The forelegs should be short and very powerful,
very heavy in bone, either half-crooked or nearly[236]
straight. The elbows should lie against the sides of
the chest, and should not turn out.

5. Hind-quarters should be powerful and muscular,
the hind-legs should be rather longer than the forelegs,
and should be well bent at the stifles.

6. Stern of moderate length and carried gaily,
should be set on high.

7. Coat.&mdash;An extremely important point. It
should be profuse, thick and harsh to the touch, with
a dense undercoat. The coat may be wavy.

8. Colour.&mdash;Any recognised Hound colour.

9. Weight.&mdash;Dogs, from 40 to 50 lbs., bitches
rather less.

The Rough Basset should appear a very powerful
Hound for his size, on short, strong legs. Body
massive and a good length, without slackness of loin.
The feet should be thick, well padded and not open.
The expression should be kindly and intelligent.
Any unsoundness should disqualify the Hound.

CHAPTER XII

The Fox Terrier


     


These Terriers have
been for a number of
years, and still are,
exceedingly popular,
chiefly, we believe on
account of the following
reasons:&mdash;(1)
Their size renders
them easily and conveniently
kept; (2)
their gameness makes
them good for destroying vermin, such as rats, etc.;
(3) making excellent house dogs, and are smart,
active companions, and as such suitable for both
sexes.

At most shows the Fox Terrier classes are better
filled than those devoted to any other variety.

There is very little reliable information as to how
and when the Fox Terrier sprang into existence, as
it is hundreds of years since Terriers were written[240]
about, though very little can be gleaned, as the word
at that time had a very ambiguous meaning, consequently
most of such records become speculative
when discussing the probable origin of any given
type of Terrier.

Rawdon B. Lee, in his book on the Fox Terrier,
gives numerous extracts from various ancient writers
with reference to the early history of the Fox Terrier,
but the information leaves one very little
wiser, upon the earlier history of these game little
Terriers. It is a problem that bears every possibility
of remaining unsolved.

For the present purpose it is sufficient to know
that the breed is with us in a very high state of
perfection, and that this has been attained by
selection within the last fifty years, or thereabout.

Whether these Terriers, as we find them on the
show bench, are equal to the tasks usually imposed
upon their predecessors, is another matter, and one
that Fox Terrier men, in general, are not always
inclined to discuss.

That there are any amount of game Fox Terriers
on the show bench there is abundant evidence to
prove, but we have no knowledge as to whether
these constitute the majority.

[246][247]

The Fox Terrier Club, the Fylde Fox Terrier
Club, and Fox Terrier clubs galore in other parts of
the country have done wonders towards improving
the show-bench qualities of the modern Fox
Terrier, and still more to render him popular in
almost all parts of the globe.

There are two varieties&mdash;the Smooth and the Wire-haired,
but of the two the Smooth are in greater
demand, requiring much less attention to their
toilet.

Fox Terriers are very easy to rear, are hardy,
usually of good constitution, pleasant in the house,
though not always reliable with children, more
especially under provocation.

Puppies should be docked when they are two or
three weeks old, and weaned about the fifth week.
Before showing, we recommend washing on the
previous day, adding a little blue to the water.
Hard coats are greatly softened by washing.

The Fox Terrier Club's description leaving little
to be desired as to the show points of the Terrier,
the author has taken the liberty of reproducing it as
issued by that body.

Standard of Points Recommended by the
Fox Terrier Club

Head and Ears (value 15).&mdash;The skull should be
flat and moderately narrow, and gradually decreasing
in width to the eyes. Not much "stop" should
be apparent, but there should be more dip in the
profile between the forehead and top jaw than is
seen in the case of a Greyhound.

[248]

The cheeks must not be full.

The ears should be V-shaped and small, of
moderate thickness, and dropping forward close to
the cheek, not hanging by the side of the head like
those of a Foxhound.

The jaw, upper and under, should be strong and
muscular; should be of fair punishing strength, but
not so in any way to resemble the Greyhound or
modern English Terrier. There should not be
much falling away below the eyes. This part of
the head should, however, be moderately chiselled
out, so as not to go down in a straight line like a
wedge.

The nose, towards which the muzzle must gradually
taper, should be black.

The eyes should be dark in colour, small, and
rather deep-set, full of fire, life, and intelligence; as
nearly as possible circular in shape.

The teeth should be as nearly as possible level,
i.e., the upper teeth on the outside of the lower
teeth.

Neck (value 5).&mdash;The neck should be clean and
muscular, without throatiness, of fair length, and
gradually widening to the shoulders.

[254][255]

Shoulders and Chest (value 10).&mdash;The shoulders
should be long and sloping, well laid back, fine at
the points, and clearly cut at the withers.

The chest deep and not broad.

Back and Loin (value 10).&mdash;The back should be
short, straight, and strong, with no appearance of
slackness.

The loin should be powerful and very slightly
arched. The fore-ribs moderately arched, the back-ribs
deep, and the dog well ribbed up.

Hind-quarters (value 15).&mdash;Should be strong and
muscular, quite free from droop or crouch; the
thighs long and powerful; hocks near the ground,
the dog standing well up on them like a Foxhound,
and not straight in the stifle.

Stern (value 5).&mdash;Should be set on rather high
and carried gaily, but not over the back or curled.
It should be of good strength, anything approaching
a "pipe-stopper" tail being especially objectionable.

Legs and Feet (value 15).&mdash;The legs viewed in any
direction must be straight, showing little or no
appearance of an ankle in front. They should be
strong in bone throughout, short and straight to
pastern. Both fore-and hind-legs should be carried
straight forward in travelling, the stifles not turned
outwards. The elbows should hang perpendicular to
the body, working free of the sides. The feet should[256]
be round, compact, and not large, the soles hard and
tough, the toes moderately arched, and turned neither
in nor out.

Coat (value 10).&mdash;Should be straight, flat, smooth,
hard, dense, and abundant. The belly and under
side of the thighs should not be bare.

As regards colour, white should predominate, brindle
red, or liver markings are objectionable. Otherwise
this point is of little or no importance.

Symmetry, Size, and Character (value 15).&mdash;The
dog must present a general gay, lively, and active
appearance; bone and strength in a small compass
are essentials, but this must not be taken to mean
that a Fox Terrier should be cloddy, or in any way
coarse&mdash;speed and endurance must be looked to as
well as power, and the symmetry of the Foxhound
taken as a model. The Terrier, like the Hound, must
on no account be leggy, nor must he be too short in
the leg. He should stand like a cleanly-made hunter,
covering a lot of ground, yet with a short back as
before stated. He will then attain the highest degree
of propelling power, together with the greatest length
of strides that is compatible with the length of his
body. Weight is not a certain criterion of a Terrier's
fitness for his work&mdash;general shape, size, and contour
are the main points, and if a dog can gallop and stay,
and follow his fox up a drain, it matters little what
his weight is to a pound or so&mdash;though, roughly
speaking, it may be said he should not scale over
20 lbs. in show condition.

Rough Fox Terrier

This variety of the breed should resemble the
Smooth sort in every respect except the coat, which
should be broken. The harder and more wiry the
texture of the coat is the better. On no account
should the dog look or feel woolly, and there should
be no silky hair about the poll or elsewhere. The
coat should not be too long, so as to give a dog a
shaggy appearance, but at the same time it should
show a marked and distinct difference all over from
the Smooth species.

CHAPTER XIII

The Skye Terrier

These little Terriers are natives of the Island of Skye
and adjoining coast, though by what means the breed
was originally produced there does not appear to be
any accurate data to go upon. The Skye is the only
truly long-coated Sporting Terrier in Great Britain,
cross-bred dogs excepted.

The introduction of this long coat into a Terrier&mdash;dogs
originally bred for rough-and-tumble work, can
hardly have been advantageous, and the remarkably
profuse coats of typical specimens in the present day
is absolutely detrimental for work; moreover, it requires
very careful grooming to keep the coat in a
perfect state, though the texture of the hair being
much harder than the silky coat of the Yorkshire
Toy, gives less trouble than the last named.

Skyes are divided into "drop"-eared, and "prick"-eared,
the chief differences being the carriage of the
ears and tail. The drop-eared has a little longer and
softer coat, longer body, and slightly smaller head; in[270]
all other respects they are practically the same.
They are generally very game little Terriers, and
will hold their own, weight for weight, in combat
with any dog. Are good companions; of good constitution,
and not given to quarrelling, unless interfered
with.

Many indifferent specimens of the breed are
remarkably clever for destroying vermin, and take
to water without the slightest trouble.

In colour the Skye should be a steel-grey or blue,
silver-grey, or fawn. If fawn, black or dark-brown
tipped, and if silver-grey, black tipped.

The coat is a very important matter; taken along
with the head it constitutes thirty-five per cent. value
in point judging.

For the show bench, the outer coat must be long,
in fact, reaching to the ground. For work, this is
objectionable. Better to be of medium length, and
this is the sort of coat that judges will do well to
plump for. The outer coat to be of hard texture;
straight, and long, and the under coat close and
woolly. The long hair on the head almost completely
conceals the sharp brown or hazel-coloured
eyes.

A thick, soft, woolly undercoat affords the most
perfect protection against wet to the skin, and
supports the outer coat, as in Rough-coated Collies.
Both limbs and tail must be well feathered in the
case of show dogs, but for work, too much hair in
these regions is a nuisance.

[271]


     
     Typical Prick-eared Skye Terrier Dog (Property of Miss M'Cheane).


[272][273]

In drop-eared Skyes a low carriage of tail is
desirable, but in the prick-eared variety on a level
with the back.

The hair down the spinal column has a parting in
it, causing the coat to hang, in curtain-like fashion,
from head to tail.

Head.&mdash;This should be long, rather wide between
the eyes, flat on the skull, and narrow between ears.
Nose black, and hard palate black, or nearly so.
Ears about 2 inches, and lying close to cheeks. If
prick-eared, to be well up, and inclined forward.

Body long, and ribs well rounded. The back
ought to be fairly level, rising at the croup.

Legs, short and strong, having round feet, well
covered with hair.

Weight.&mdash;From 16 to 20 lbs.

Faults.&mdash;Short back, faulty carriage of ears, thin
coat, too short coat, legginess, bad carriage of tail,
bad colour, too light, etc.

Club.&mdash;Skye Terrier.

Prices.&mdash;Typical puppies, at six or eight weeks, can
be bought at prices ranging from four to twelve
guineas, but it is advisable to purchase Skyes when
they are older, as one is then in a better position to
speculate&mdash;for such it is&mdash;as to the probable subsequent
value, for the show bench.

[274]

The Bedlington Terrier

This breed of Terrier has certain features distinct
from that of all others, and originated, so far as we
are able to glean, in the county of Northumberland,
over a century since.

William and James Allan appear to have had a
great deal to do with laying foundation-stone of this
variety of Terrier.

It is said that James Allan lived in a gipsy
camp about the year 1730, in the Rothbury Forest,
and that his father, William, was famed for other
hunting Terriers, which were then known under the
title of Rodbury, or Rothbury Terriers.

During 1825 a stone mason, to name Tom Ainsley,
had a dog that he called Young Piper, and
through his residence in the locality of Bedlington
(near Newcastle), the present breed derived its
name.

The dam of Piper was black, with brindled legs,
and light-coloured hair on the top, and she weighed
about 14 lbs. and the sire was about the same
weight, liver-coloured, with a somewhat hard
texture of hair.

Bedlingtons are very game dogs, and will generally
tackle anything their own weight.

[275]


     
     Bedlington Terrier Dog (Mr H. Warnes).


[276][277]

They make good watch-dogs, and are capital
"ratters," etc. Many cross-bred Terriers&mdash;and game
ones too, have a considerable proportion of Bedlington
blood in them. Their chief points are as
follows:&mdash;

Height.&mdash;About 15 inches.

Weight.&mdash;22 to 24 lbs.

Colour.&mdash;Sandy, liver, dark blue, blue and tan,
liver and tan.

Nose.&mdash;If dark blue, or blue and tan, the nose
should be black, but when liver-coloured, sandy, or
liver and tan, then the nose ought to correspond,
being either liver, or flesh-coloured.

Coat.&mdash;Hard in texture, standing well off the body.
A great deal of trimming is necessary to get
Bedlingtons fit for the show bench.

Skull.&mdash;Narrow, but should have a good dome on
it, with a silky "top-knot" or "crown." From the
eyes to nose, face ought to be long, and rather
narrow.

The jaw to be long and the lips tight-fitting, free
from flew. Strong, level teeth.

Small, deeply-sunk, keen-looking eyes, moderate-sized
ears, carried flat on cheeks, and covered with
soft hair, are typical of the Bedlington.

The neck should be long, well set up, and strongly
muscled.

Body.&mdash;This is moderately long, deep at the chest,
and slender at the waist.

Tail.&mdash;Long, tapering, thick at "set-on ," feathered[278]
on under surface, and the carriage of it reminds one,
somewhat of the Setter.

Limbs and Quarters.&mdash;To be of medium length,
straight and strong.

Club.&mdash;The Bedlington Terrier.

The Scottish Terrier


     


Sometimes spoken
of as the "Die-hard,"
a name said to have
been given to them
by George, Earl of
Dumbarton, owing to
the pluck of a pack
owned by him.

The title is certainly
not a misnomer, these
little Terriers of Highland
descent still having the gameness of their
ancestors, though many of them at the present time
are only used as ladies' companions.

The terms "Aberdeen" and "Scottish" Terrier
are&mdash;or should be&mdash;synonymous, though an inferior
specimen of a "Scottie" has, and is, frequently
sold to the unwary as an "Aberdeen." Another
name is that of "Cairn" Terrier, which speaks
for itself, these dogs having been expressly bred for
hunting in the cairns, or spaces amongst heaps of
rocks, etc.

     A Trio of Scottish Terriers (Property of Mr M'Candlish).


[282][283]

Owing to their small size, they are admirably
adapted for such purposes. Some will retrieve and
take well to water; are good companions, and active
house dogs. They are very hardy, consequently
puppies are not difficult to rear, and fair specimens
of the last-named can be had at two and three
guineas apiece.

The following are the chief points of the Scottish
Terrier.

Coat.&mdash;In point judging, 20 per cent. of the marks
are allotted to the coat&mdash;so many are faulty in this
respect. Outer coat must be very thick, short, and
of a hard or wiry texture, and absolutely free from
any sign of curl, or waviness.

Hair, 2 or 3 inches in length. Under coat, very
dense.

The so-called "open" coat is a fault. The term is
sufficiently explanatory.

Weight.&mdash;From 14 to 20 lbs. for dogs and a few
pounds less for bitches.

Colour.&mdash;Not of great importance, but white
markings are objectionable; less important on the
breast, but better without any white hairs.

White specimens are rare.

Brindle, black, red, mustard, and iron-grey, are the[284]
usual colours, the black and brindle shades being
preferred.

Body.&mdash;Important (value 10). This should be
short, so as to give the dog a sturdy, compact
appearance.

Some Scotties are too long in the body.

Neck.&mdash;To be short and thick, ending in good,
strong, sloping shoulders.

Chest.&mdash;Deep, well-rounded on to the shoulders,
and plump.

Limbs and Feet.&mdash;Legs, short, big-boned, well-muscled,
straight, though generally turned out at
ankles, ending in large fore feet, and smaller well-padded
hind ones. The same hard hairs should
clothe the limbs. If soft, it is a fault.

Ears.&mdash;Erect, or semi (half) erect. Must never
"droop" at tips. Should be covered with short
hair.

Particular attention is paid by judges to the
carriage of the ears of the Scottie.

Eyes.&mdash;To be either dark brown or hazel, giving
a lively expression to the face.

Head.&mdash;Rather long, and wide above the eyes.
Most of the length is gained from eyes to nose.

Hair to be hard and short (not soft).

Muzzle.&mdash;Long, tapering, and very strong.

Sound teeth&mdash;exceptionally large&mdash;and tight lips
are a sine qua non.

[285]


     
     Group of Scottish Terriers (Property of Mr M'Candlish).


[286][287]

Height.&mdash;9 to 12 inches.

Clubs.&mdash;1. The English Scottish Terrier Society;
2. Scotch Scottish Terrier Society.

The Irish Terrier

This is unquestionably a very ancient variety of
dog, indigenous to the Emerald Isle, in certain
features being a modification of the Wolfhound of
that country.

Practically, there is no history of the breed, its
origin being involved in obscurity.

Ballymena and County Wicklow are said to have
been the chief birth-places of these Terriers.
Although but a speculative statement at its best, it
is a very probable one, and in accordance with what
one knows of the history of many other breeds.
More recent history of the breed may be said to date
from about 1875, marked by their appearance on the
show bench in Ireland and the following year in
England. They are excellent vermin Terriers, very
affectionate to those to whom they become attached,
and, as a rule, exceedingly good-tempered. Their
dash and pluck has earned for them the sobriquet
of "Dare-devils," as in the case of the Scottish
Terrier&mdash;"Die-hards."

These Terriers should have a black nose, strong
and level teeth, small hazel-coloured eyes, small V-shaped[288]
ears, directed forwards, so as to fall closely to
the sides of the head, free from feather, and the hair
on them of darker shade than the rest of the body.
A Dudley (red) nose will disqualify. The head long,
like that of a Fox Terrier, the skull flat, and from
the lower jaw there should be rather longer hairs,
forming a sort of beard&mdash;a characteristic feature of
the Dare-devil. A good punishing lower jaw is
essential. The head, jaws, teeth, and eyes constitute
fifteen per cent. of value in the Irish Terrier Club's
scale of points, only equalled by that of the coat.

Coat.&mdash;Straight and flat, free from any curl, and of
hard or wiry texture.

A soft coat very detrimental, as in the Wire-haired
and Scottish Terriers. If the hair of an Irish
Terrier is too long, he loses the contour of body, and
this ought not to be so.

Colour.&mdash;Bright red is much preferred. Some are
yellowish-red, others yellow, wheaten and grey.

Brindle will disqualify, and white on feet is a fault,
less detrimental, in the judge's eye, when on the
chest, but, as in nearly every other breed, Irishmen
are better without any white hair.

Neck.&mdash;To be of moderate length, carried well up,
having a slight frill on either side of it, and ending
in strong shoulders, of good shape, with a chest of
medium width.

     Airedale Terrier Dog.


[292][293]

Body.&mdash;The Irish Terrier has rather a long body,
due, in part at least, to the rather narrow&mdash;though
very muscular&mdash;upper part of the thighs, increasing
the flank area. In this region the breed is somewhat
shallow. Strong loins and the so-called "gay"
carriage of tail is requisite. Dock not too short.

Limbs and Feet.&mdash;Must be free from feather. Feet
small, compact, and black toe nails. Forearms of
medium length, straight, with plenty of bone and
muscle.

Many Irishmen have very poor fore-limbs, either
too long, bent, or weak.

Must be well set up in front, and free movers in
both fore-and hind-limbs.

Weight.&mdash;About 20 lbs., a few pounds more or less
being unimportant.

Club.&mdash;The Irish Terrier.

Prices.&mdash;First-rate puppies can be got at three and
four guineas each.

The Airedale Terrier

This useful variety of dog first of all appears to
have sprung up in the districts of Saltaire, Bingley,
Shipley Glen, Keighley, etc., in Yorkshire, and it is
to the credit of Yorkshiremen for having produced a
most useful variety of Terrier. Few other breeds can
surpass, or even equal, the gameness, docility, and[294]
general usefulness of these rough-and-ready, companionable
Terriers.

In appearance, it would hardly be correct to speak
of the Airedale as being handsome, but the weird
expression upon the face, and thoughtful-looking
eyes offer an irresistible charm to those who are
fond of a really good pal, and inexpensive forms
of sport, such as ratting, etc., on river-banks, and
the like used to be called Waterside Terriers.

When looking at many of the larger Airedales, one
can hardly help thinking but that the breed has been
produced by crossing some Terrier, e.g. Bedlington,
etc., with an Otterhound. To this latter breed many
inferior specimens bear a strong resemblance, in
appearance, habits, and temperament.

If properly trained, an Airedale ought to take to
water like a duck, be obedient to his master's call,
and form an unceasing attachment towards him.

Typical specimens should have a rough or broken
coat, dense and wiry, free from curl&mdash;a common
fault; be of a dark grizzle on the back from top of
skull to set on of tail, likewise on the sides of the
body and skull.

The remaining portions of the body ought to be a
rich tan, the ears being of a deeper tan than the rest.

The weight for dogs should be from about 40 to 45
lbs., and bitches 35 to 40 lbs.

[295]


     
     Airedale Terrier Dog Crompton Marvel (Property
of Leaver Brothers).


[296][297]

Colour, coat, and head are very important points,
and judges of the breed lay great stress upon the
"ideal" in these particulars.

Skull should be flat, of medium width, and show no
"stop" when viewed from the front; with square, long
and strong jaws, bearing large and level teeth, free
from decay. Nose black, and nostrils full, V-shaped
ears, with Fox-Terrier carriage and small dark
eyes.

Chest deep, of fair width (not wide); shoulders
long, strong, and of good slope; neck of medium
length, with short, strong back, well-sprung ribs and
broad, muscular loins&mdash;the last two being specially
desirable. Fore-limbs well rounded, straight and
strong, ending in round, thick feet.

As to the hind-quarters, these ought to be well
clothed with powerfully developed muscles, the
"dock" being set on high up and carried (when
excited) very like that of a Fox Terrier.

The chief disqualifying points of the Airedale are:
a Dudley nose, white feet, white on throat or face, and
defective teeth, undershot, etc.

Many Airedale Terriers are much too big, rendering
them over cumbersome for activity.

It is a variety of dog fairly easy to rear, and good
specimens, during puppyhood, can be bought at prices
varying from two to five guineas.

Clubs.&mdash;Airedale Terrier; South of England

The White West Highland (Poltalloch) Terrier

To Colonel Malcolm, C.B., the author is, through
the kindness of Our Dogs' Gazette, indebted for the
following description of the breed (see Appendix).

"The White West Highland or Poltalloch Terriers
are a very old breed of dog in the West Highlands of
Scotland, with traditions of two hundred years, and
they are known to have existed for at least eighty
years certain at Poltalloch, in Argyllshire. It is
only of late years that any of them have been publicly
exhibited, and this because Colonel Malcolm, C.B., of
Poltalloch, felt that it was not just to the West
Highlands, and I think, of Scotland, that this ancient
breed of handsome hard-bitten dogs should be
absolutely ignored by the canine world.

"The Western Highlands of Scotland are not overrun
with railways and other means of rapid communication,
so showing is both difficult and extra
expensive, and the possessors of good dogs of the
breed have not hitherto come forward in numbers to
show what they have. And this is a breed which
must be carefully handled by bench judges, for they
are actual working dogs, and it will be a thousand
pities if they get spoiled, or, in Mr G. T. Teasdale-Buckell's
words, become defiled by scales of points, or
degraded by the hunting of the tin-pot at dog shows.

[305]


     
     Brace of White West Highland Terriers (Property of Colonel Malcolm, C.B.).


[306][307]

"Colonel Malcolm's views are much as follows:&mdash;Dogs
should not exceed 18 lbs., nor bitches 16 lbs., in
weight. They should be very active, for in power to
spring considerable heights they may at times owe
their lives in a fox cairn. Heads should be broad,
and eyes not closely set. The latter point gives room
for the brain pan, and without brains there cannot be
much intelligence. The former point provides for the
very powerful muscles which enable his dogs to cope
successfully with badgers, foxes, otters, etc., in their
native fastnesses. He strives also for as light a jaw as
may be, contending that the fox is as good a model
as can be followed, and against the craze for heavy,
or as they are called, 'strong' jaws, that the heads
of the cat and otter, both of which animals have a
bite of extraordinary power, might almost be called
round, so short and so wide are their jaws.

"Another point, practically as yet never looked at
by the show-bench judges, is the working coat. Now
it is no matter whether the outer coat be hard or soft.
It should be long enough first to throw off water
with a good shake of the body, and to act as a good
thatch to a thick undergrowth of finest down, which
will enable the wearer to stand the worst of weather,
and for perfection the coat should be strongest on[308]
the sit-down portions of the body. Eyes must be
dark and nose jet black, and also a good deal of the
mouth inside. This dog is as good underground
as he is on the show bench. How many champions,
I wonder, of other Terrier breeds have killed
underground?"

The Welsh Terrier

It is only within the last few years that this variety
of Terrier has made his appearance on the English
show benches, though indifferent specimens have been
in existence in Wales for a number of years.

The Welsh Terrier Club and the Kennel Club have
been the chief mediums through which the present
standard of excellence has been obtained.

They are nice, smart, active little Terriers, and
when properly trained make exceedingly useful companions,
being full of pluck and ready to tackle anything
their own height.

In colour, the Welshman is grizzle and tan, the
coat being similar in texture to that of the wire-haired
Fox Terrier, smooth and free from curl.

The Head ought to be long, more especially from
eyes to nose, the occipital dome being a trifle more
marked than it is in the Irish Terrier. Ears small,
and curved close to sides of face.

Neck.&mdash;Of medium length and thickness, ending in
oblique shoulders.

[309]

Arms.&mdash;Short and strong.

Forearms.&mdash;Of medium length, straight, and well
muscled, tapering from elbows to feet.

Back and Loins.&mdash;Strong, and ribs well sprung.

Tail.&mdash;Docked short, and curved like that of an
Irish Terrier.

First and Second Thighs.&mdash;Strong and well
muscled.

Feet.&mdash;Of a hare shape, but compact. A typical

The Dandie-Dinmont

It was not until 1814 that this variety of dog
received his present name, through Sir Walter Scott
having written Guy Mannering, in which the hero,
Dandie Dinmont, plays such a conspicuous part.

To the Field, so far back as 1778, a Mr J. Davidson
wrote a letter as to how James Davidson, the original
Dandie Dinmont, came into the possession of his
first Dandies, the chief of this account being as
follows:&mdash;

"The Border Muggers were great breeders of
Terriers, and in their wanderings the different tribes
would meet once or twice yearly at some of the
border villages. If they could not get a badger,
they would try their dogs on a foumart (wildcat) or
a hedgehog.

"Jock Anderson, the head of the tribe, had a red
bitch that for such work beat all the dogs that came
over the border.

"Geordie Faa had a wire-haired dog that was the
terror of all the dogs in the district, and that was
good at badger, fox, or foumart.

"A badger had been procured, and both the dog
and bitch drew the badger every time.

"Geordie Faa said to Jock Anderson, 'Let's have
a big drink, the man first down to lose his dog.'

[311]

[312][313]

"'Done,' says Jock.

"Down they sat on the green, and in eighteen hours
Jock was laid out, and Geordie started off with the
dogs.

"They were mated, and produced the first Pepper
and Mustard, and these were presented by Geordie to
James Davidson ('Dandie Dinmont')."

The foregoing account would appear to be fairly
acceptable, and one that is in accordance with the
gameness of these little Terriers.

The breed is a hardy one; are good-tempered, and
make excellent companions.

The chief points of the Dandie-Dinmont are as
follows:&mdash;

Head.&mdash;The skull ought to be broad between
the ears, and the forehead well domed. It should be
covered with light, silky hair, softer the better. The
muzzle deep, and from it&mdash;excepting the bare part
about an inch from the back part of the nose&mdash;there
ought to be hair growing, a little darker than that
on the head.

Level, strong, and sound teeth are a sine qua non.

Large, full round eyes, set well apart, and low
down, with a lively expression; a black nose;
black inside mouth, together with large, low-placed,
pendulous ears, hanging close to cheek, and tapering
on their posterior borders.

[314]

The ears should be covered with soft, brown hair,
forming a feathering around the bottom, and 3 or 4
inches long.

Neck.&mdash;Short and well rounded.

Body, long and strong, with well-rounded ribs,
and a downward curve behind the shoulders, but
slightly arched at the loins.

Tail.&mdash;About 8 inches in length, thick at the
set-on , and then thicker for 2 or 3 inches, afterwards
tapering.

The upper face of the tail should be covered with
wiry hair, and the under side also have lighter-coloured
hair. When at rest, the tail ought to
assume a scimitar-like curve, and under excitement
carried on a level with its set-on .

Fore-and Hind-limbs.&mdash;Short fore-legs, set well
apart, and if dog is blue-coloured, the hair on them
should be tan or fawn, in accordance with body colour.

A couple of inches of feather ought to be present,
and a shade lighter than that on the front of the legs.

In a "mustard" Dandie the hair on the head is
cream-coloured.

The hind-legs, have no feather, neither should they
have any dewclaws. If present at birth they must
be removed.

Colour.&mdash;Mustard or Pepper. If the former, the
tint is from a reddish-brown to a delicate fawn; the
head creamy and darker.

[315]

Pepper-coloured Dandies are either steel-coloured,
or a light silvery grey, and are preferred with the
body colour blending with that on the limbs.

The most useful weight is about 20 lbs., and the
height 8 to 11 inches.

The coat should be a mixture of hard and soft hair,
yet crisp to the feel.

Society.&mdash;Dandie-Dinmont Terrier.

Standard of Points of the Dandie-Dinmont
Terrier,

As Defined and Adopted by The Dandie-Dinmont
Terrier Club.

Head.&mdash;Strongly made and large, not out of
proportion to the dog's size, the muscles showing
extraordinary development, more especially the maxillary.
Skull broad between the ears, getting gradually
less towards the eyes, and measuring about the same
from the inner corner of the eye to back of skull as
it does from ear to ear. The forehead well domed.
The head is covered with very soft silky hair, which
should not be confined to a mere top-knot, and the
lighter in colour and silkier it is the better. The
cheeks, starting from the ears proportionately with
the skull, have a gradual taper towards the muzzle,
which is deep and strongly made, and measures[316]
about 3 inches in length, or in proportion to skull
as three is to five. The muzzle is covered with hair
of a little darker shade than the top-knot, and of the
same texture as the feather of the fore-legs. The top
of the muzzle is generally bare for about an inch
from the back part of the nose, the bareness coming
to a point towards the eye, and being about 1 inch
broad at the nose. The nose and inside of mouth black
or dark coloured. The teeth very strong, especially
the canine, which are of extraordinary size for such
a small dog. The canines fit well into each other, so
as to give the greatest available holding and punishing
power, and the teeth are level in front, the upper
ones very slightly overlapping the under ones.
[Many of the finest specimens have a "swine mouth,"
which is very objectionable, but it is not so great an
objection as the protrusion of the under jaw.]

Eyes.&mdash;Set wide apart, large, full, round, bright,
expressive of great determination, intelligence and
dignity; set low and prominent in front of the head;
colour, a rich dark hazel.

Ears.&mdash;Pendulous, set well back, wide apart, and
low on the skull, hanging close to the cheek, with a
very slight projection at the base, broad at the
junction of the head and tapering almost to a point,
the fore part of the ear tapering very little&mdash;the
tapering being mostly on the back part, the fore
part of the ear coming almost straight down from[317]
its junction with the head to the tip. They should
harmonise in colour with the body colour. In the
case of a Pepper dog they are covered with a soft,
straight, brownish hair (in some cases almost black).
In the case of a Mustard dog the hair should be
mustard in colour, a shade darker than the body, but
not black. All should have a thin feather of light
hair starting about 2 inches from the tip, and of
nearly the same colour and texture as the top-knot,
which gives the ear the appearance of a distinct
point. The animal is often one and two years old
before the feather is shown. The cartilage and skin
of the ear should not be thick, but rather thin.
Length of ear from 3 to 4 inches.

Neck.&mdash;Very muscular, well-developed, and strong,
showing great power of resistance, being well set
into the shoulders.

Body.&mdash;Long, strong and flexible; ribs well sprung
and round, chest well developed and let well down
between the fore-legs; the back rather low at the
shoulder, having a slight downward curve and a
corresponding arch over the loins, with a very
slight gradual drop from top of loins to root of tail;
both sides of backbone well supplied with muscle.

Tail.&mdash;Rather short, say from 8 inches to 10
inches, and covered on the upper side with wiry
hair of darker colour than that of the body, the hair
on the under side being lighter in colour and not so[318]
wiry, with nice feather about 2 inches long,
getting shorter as it nears the tip; rather thick at
the root, getting thicker for about 4 inches, then
tapering off to a point. It should not be twisted or
curled in any way, but should come up with a curve
like a scimitar, the tip, when excited, being in a
perpendicular line with the root of the tail. It
should neither be set on too high nor too low. When
not excited it is carried gaily, and a little above the
level of the body.

Legs.&mdash;The fore-legs short, with immense muscular
development and bone, set wide apart, the chest
coming well down between them. The feet well
formed, and not flat, with very strong brown or
dark-coloured claws. Bandy legs and flat feet are
objectionable. The hair on the fore-legs and feet of
a Pepper dog should be tan, varying according to
the body colour from a rich tan to a pale fawn; of a
Mustard dog they are of a darker shade than its
head, which is a creamy white. In both colours
there is a nice feather, about 2 inches long, rather
lighter in colour than the hair on the fore part of
the leg. The hind-legs are a little longer than the
fore ones, and are set rather wide apart, but not
spread out in an unnatural manner, while the feet
are much smaller; the thighs are well developed,
and the hair of the same colour and texture as the
fore ones, but having no feather or dewclaws; the[319]
whole claws should be dark; but the claws of all
vary in shade according to the colour of the dog's
body.

Coat.&mdash;This is a very important point; the hair
should be about 2 inches long; that from skull to
root of tail, a mixture of hardish and soft hair,
which gives a sort of crisp feel to the hand. The
hard should not be wiry; the coat is what is termed
pily or pencilled. The hair on the under part of
the body is lighter in colour and softer than on the
top. The skin on the belly accords with the colour
of dog.

Colour.&mdash;The colour is Pepper or Mustard. The
Pepper ranges from a dark bluish black to a light
silvery grey, the intermediate shades being preferred,
the body colour coming well down the
shoulder and hips, gradually merging into the leg
colour. The Mustards vary from a reddish brown
to a pale fawn, the head being a creamy white, the
legs and feet of a shade darker than the head. The
claws are dark as in other colours. [Nearly all
Dandie-Dinmont Terriers have some white on the
chest, and some have also white claws.]

Size.&mdash;The height should be from 8 to 11
inches at the top of shoulder. Length from
top of shoulder to root of tail should not be
more than twice the dog's height, but preferably,
1 or 2 inches less.

[320]

Weight.&mdash;From 14 lbs. to 24 lbs.; the best weight
as near 18 lbs. as possible. These weights are for
dogs in good working condition.

[332][333]



CHAPTER XIV

The Afghan Greyhound

Through the kindness of Cary Barnard, Esq., of
Hailsham, I am able to give an illustration of this
variety of dog so scarce in this country, the
specimen depicted being typical of the breed.

These Hounds are said to be somewhat difficult
to obtain, the owners are unwilling to part with
them, being kept by a class who consider it a distinction
to own them.

In the Natural History Museum at South Kensington
there is a stuffed specimen, practically identical
with the one herein portrayed.

Built on racing lines, in almost every particular,
these dogs look exceedingly quaint, chiefly because
of the feather, or long hairs, upon the ears, throat,
backs of the limbs, feet, and tail.

Skull is rather broad, and flat on the top, but
there is no "stop."

Eyes.&mdash;Small, placed close together and well to
the front, giving the animal the appearance of having
a very penetrating vision.

Ears.&mdash;Remind one of a short-eared Spaniel, and
from over their surface long hairs proceed.

[334]

Neck.&mdash;Long, rather thick, and the body and loins
long, yet well coupled.

When viewed from the front, these Hounds look
very tall, due to the great length of the arms and
forearms. These regions, and those of the shoulders,
are strongly built.

When at rest, tail is carried rather like that of the
Irish Water Spaniel, and during excitement, elevated,
but not carried over the back. It has an abundance
of long hair.

First and second thighs long, and feathery to a
short distance above the hocks. Hind toes are well
clothed with hair. The hocks are strong, low-placed,
and pasterns long.

Colour.&mdash;Fawn, with the feathered portions running
to a silvery white.

Weight.&mdash;About 50 lbs.

Height at shoulder.&mdash;24 inches, or thereabout.

Uses.&mdash;During Captain Barnard's residence in
Afghanistan, the Hound depicted in our illustration
was used for running jackal, and said to be very useful
for this purpose.

He is an exceptionally fine jumper, having made a
clean leap over a fence 9 feet 4 inches in height&mdash;a
most creditable performance. This Hound has
won numerous prizes, including a 2nd, at Crystal
Palace.

     Afghan Greyhound (Property of Mr Cary Barnard).


[336][337]

The Lurcher

We shall do little more than mention the existence
of this cross-bred variety of dog.

The proprietor of a Lurcher has always been
regarded as one who will, when the opportunity
offers, take his dog "up the back stairs," and gamekeepers
generally look upon the owner of a Lurcher
as one worthy of a little extra vigilance.

Any cross-bred dog, in whom the Greyhound blood
predominates, may be designated as a Lurcher, and
can be trained as such.

Many of these dogs are wonderfully clever on
rabbits, and some will kill a hare single-handed,
more especially if about three-quarter bred on the
Greyhound side, when staying power and swiftness
are highly developed.

Good at fighting, good at poaching, good at retrieving,
and fidelity to master, may justly be claimed
as the Lurcher's inheritance.



THE TRAINING, USE, AND ABUSE, OF
NIGHT-DOGS

To Mr W. Burton, of Thorneywood Kennels,
Nottingham (per gamekeeper), I am indebted for the
following account.

"A perfectly trained and reliable night-dog[338]
is as useful to the gamekeeper as two or
three additional assistants, and, indeed, I have
personally heard old poachers remark that they
would rather face a dozen men than half that
number accompanied by one of these animals, even
if resistance would be offered at all where a dog was
employed against them. Such being the case, it
makes one wonder why night-dogs are not more
frequently used by gamekeepers in rough localities,
and I am afraid the animals have come into disrepute,
owing to the manner in which their employment
has been abused by careless watchers.

"It must not be supposed that a night-dog
simply requires rearing, and that when old enough
a muzzle has only to be put on and he will face
anything he is encouraged to attack. The dog
must be trained to his duty as a retriever is
taught to bring in game, or he will never prove
a satisfactory companion when poachers are
about.

"When a puppy has been procured, he should
be accustomed to wear a muzzle from an early
age&mdash;five months for instance&mdash;and strangers should
not be allowed to pet and caress him; on the
other hand, they may tease him as much as they
like, providing that he is not hurt. Of all the
muzzles made I prefer those with a solid piece of
leather beneath the jaw, and straps round the neck
and nose having buckles so that they may be
manipulated as required.

[339]


     
     The Celebrated Keeper's Night-Dog Thorneywood Terror, said
to be the most perfectly trained Night Dog ever bred. (Property
of Mr Burton, Thorneywood Kennels, Nottingham.)


[340][341]

"When the dog is ten months old and quite
used to wearing its muzzle, he should be taken
muzzled to a quiet place where you have previously
arranged for a perfect stranger to be. This man
should have a bag rolled up and strapped to one
hand, and a glove on the other, and should be in
hiding at the appointed spot; when the dog and
his master get within a hundred yards or so, the
stranger should 'break covert' and run out across
the field. The dog must at once be released and
encouraged to attack the man, his owner running
with him the while. Upon the dog's coming up
with his quarry it is the duty of the latter to
buffet him with the bag, pull his tail and flank,
and tease him generally. Do not let this continue
too long without a break, as a muzzled dog is soon
winded. His master should reach the spot as
quickly as possible, encourage the animal a little,
and then take him off and loosen his muzzle; after
a slight rest he may be permitted another run as
before.

"When the dog begins to display anxiety for the
fray, the man may be provided with a thin cane,
and instructed to give him a slight stroke or two,
but, at this moment, great care should be taken
to observe its effect. Some dogs, although game[342]
to a finish, are shy and sensitive, and a stroke
with a stick will cause hesitation, not from fear of
the blow, but because an impression of doing wrong
is conveyed thereby. Should the dog waver at
this treatment, relinquish the use of the stick for a
time, and then introduce it again by degrees; if
bred right he will soon commence to resent it with
fury. I have known pups from the same litter to
vary greatly in the development of courage, one
standing any amount of stick at a year, while
others would not face it until six months
older.

"Such an instance I came across a short time
ago. A keeper had a youngster from me and
eighteen months later reported that it had been
no good. I was surprised, and inquired if he had
thoroughly tried the creature. 'Yes!' said he,
'I got one of the night-watchers to run across
the park, and I then set the dog on him. The dog
followed all right, but, when struck with a stick,
returned to me, and I shot him.' This man knew
I had retained one of the litter, and inquired how
the puppy had progressed. I arranged for him to
visit me and see the dog work, and he was surprised
at what he witnessed. Afterwards I explained
that an animal of this description required training,
but my friend differed, and asserted that education
ought not to be necessary.

[343]

"In no case should a dog be trained and tried
on a lead or chain, or the result will be that he
will not chase a man. Instead, he will only go
for a poacher at close quarters, and then will
continue to look round for his owner. Teach the
dog to rely on himself. Some gamekeepers use
their dogs on a long rope and religiously keep
hold of the end thereof, but the reason for this I
never could determine, unless it is to retain the
animal for their own bodily protection. If so, the
dog is not being put to its proper duty.

"A night-dog is more valuable for catching a
man than for fighting one; still, he must be taught
to give battle, because it is love of the scrimmage
following which causes him to give chase. A dog
is certainly useful when a rough fight takes
place, but he is doubly so when active poachers
have a long start of their pursuers, for, if he jumps
at a man, he is bound to bring his victim to the
ground. Besides, if a dog refuses to chase a man,
he is of no good in the case of a gang which
freely stones the keepers, as then a resolute animal
is a welcome assistant. The chances against the
dog being hit with a stone as he makes for his
assailants are ten to one, and, once he is at close
quarters, stones cannot be thrown at him for fear
of comrades being struck, and while the animal is
busy among the party the members of it will have[344]
plenty to do to stave off his attacks, and he will
allow them little leisure for pelting the keepers
who must now hasten to the fight.

"To hark back. Suppose the dog goes for the
man when released and shows no fear of the stick,
he must then be taught to keep up the attack and
not have a jump or two and then return from the
fray, allowing his foe an opportunity of escaping.
As a means of accomplishing this, the dog's owner
should be as close to the animal as possible and
encourage him to maintain the assault. When it is
plainly to be seen that he is scant of breath, at once
take him off, because, if permitted to become tired,
the probability is that the dog will stand still, and,
as the man promptly does the same, will return to
his master, perhaps, regarding the affray as over.
Once he acquires the much-to-be-regretted habit of
doing this, it will need some patience to correct it.
It is a golden rule never to unduly exhaust a
youngster, and then, when age has been acquired,
he will be game all day or night.

"Having progressed thus far, the dog should next
be taught to find a man hidden in a ditch or up a
tree. Candidly, this is a somewhat difficult undertaking,
and it is not every night-dog which becomes
clever in this particular. Instruct the man to
secrete himself in a ditch at the opposite side of the
field; be careful to give the dog the wind, and in[345]
nine cases out of ten it will be noticed that he gazes
as if looking for someone. Now move towards the
hidden person and encourage the animal onward.
As both near the ditch the dog will strongly detect
the scent of his quarry, and at this point the hidden
man should make a slight movement for the purpose
of attracting the animal's attention. This action
should be repeated until discovery takes place, and, if
the dog can thus be taught to use his nose, he
quickly becomes an adept at finding concealed
poachers.

"When this is asserted, it is not meant that a man
may be despatched with a few minutes' grace, and if
the dog is put upon the trail the man will be
followed; some bull-mastiffs may become clever
enough to foot a man, but recent trials have proved
that even bloodhounds have to possess the best of
blood and training before they will unerringly hunt
a man under these conditions.

"Another important thing a night-dog should be
taught is to at once leave a man he has thrown
down and start after another of the gang when the
keepers have arrived on the scene and laid hands on
the first man. Suppose a party of watchers drop
across half-a-dozen poachers, who all promptly take
to their heels on seeing that the opposing side are a
match for them; the chances are the poachers get a
good start, and are nearly certain to escape, if the[346]
dog is not competent to play his part. If he is
capable, promptly slipped, and closely followed, he
will soon bring one to book; he should then be
taken off and encouraged to serve another likewise,
and so on, until all have been arrested.

"To train the dog to do this, two men should start
at one time, both being armed with sticks. Instruct
the two to keep together, and when they are well on
the run slip the dog and follow him as before
directed. When the animal gets close the men must
separate, and he will confine his attentions to one;
immediately the man he first attacks is down,
despatch the dog after the second, who should be
making good pace away, while his companion stands
perfectly still. At first, the dog will plainly manifest
that he prefers to stay and worry the one he has
succeeded in defeating rather than seek for fresh
glories, but persevere with him until he does renew
the chase without the least hesitation. You will
succeed better in this if the second man is not
allowed to get too far away, and it will be advisable
for him to wave his stick and otherwise try to attract
attention and invite attack. When the dog recognises
what is required of him, increase the distance
between first and second man, or let each run in
an opposite direction. It is very necessary that a
dog should be taught to respect friends, that is, to
attack only those at whom he is set, and then at no[347]
other time but when he is encouraged to do so. If
he fails to learn this, he is as likely as not to go at
one of the watchers who happens to move or otherwise
attract notice.

"When a dog has been sufficiently tried to prove
that he is in every way game, it is advisable to allow
the man upon whom he has been exercising his powers
to sit near and endeavour to make friends with his
four-legged opponent. All dogs will not consent to
do the agreeable to this extent, but the majority will
generally settle down and be quiet when they clearly
understand that such behaviour is expected. It is
very necessary that a dog should learn to recognise
when the battle is over, and that having duly fulfilled
his part he must be quiet, for it would be
awkward, to say the least, if a keeper has to struggle
with the animal to take him off a captured poacher,
and then the rascal takes advantage of the exhaustion
of both keeper and dog to escape.

"A night-dog should not under any circumstances
be tried on a person who may at some future time
have to accompany the animal while out watching.
If so, the dog is nearly certain to go for this person
when released for a scrimmage with poachers.
Several instances like this have occurred, and in
certain of them the dog had not been tried on the
watcher he attacked since a puppy. This proves that
they do not easily forget the identity of an opponent.

[348]

"There is one other thing a dog should learn, and,
having acquired cleverness at it in addition to the
lessons mentioned previously, the animal may be
regarded as a perfect night-dog. When lying out
with a party of watchers he must not be allowed to
get into the habit of curling himself up and going to
sleep like a fat pig. He must be taught to listen for
the coming of poachers, as it is only natural that he
should detect their approach by both sound and smell
long before their advent on the scene is palpable to
human senses. Some dogs do this naturally, and the
remainder only need encouragement to render them
proficient watchers. If a young dog displays a tendency
to fall asleep when out, arrange for a man to
come on the scene just about the time the animal will
be settled down. This individual should move as
cautiously as he can, go straight to the dog, and have
a good rough round or two with him. Repeat the
dose at intervals, and the dog will soon take to watching
attentively, expecting every sound to announce
the appearance of an antagonist.

"Never permit a night-dog to chase game or
rabbits; if he is allowed to do this the movements
made by them at night will monopolise his attention,
and the watchers will never be sure whether he
is pricking up his ears at a rabbit rustling in
the dead leaves or at the approach of poachers;
when released for a chase or scrimmage he will be[349]
likely to direct his attention towards the less noble
game.

"Opinions vary as to the weight a night-dog should
attain, but a small dog, however persevering he may
be, cannot be so effective as one which has the
qualities of being large, game, and active. Suppose
a dog, of 50 or 60 lbs. weight only, were to jump at a
man, the latter could not be knocked down. A clever
poacher would wait his opportunity, catch the animal
in his arms, and throw him over an adjacent wall or
fence, well aware that the dog could not jump back.
A night-dog should not be less than 80 lbs., and if he
is 100 lbs., strong and active, so much the better. He
ought to be able to jump a gate with ease and to get
over ground at a good pace. For colour a brindle is
to be preferred, not being so plainly visible at night
as a red, fawn, or even black dog.

"When a perfect dog has been bought or trained,
every care should be taken that the animal is used
properly. He should only be slipped at a man when
absolutely necessary, and then must be securely
muzzled. If a scrimmage becomes desperate and
develops into a fight for life, the watchers must use
their own discretion as to allowing their dog freedom
to bite; if his muzzle be taken off, the man he attacks
will surely be marked in such a way that he will be
easily identified. To slip a night-dog at lads trespassing
after mushrooms, blackberries, etc., is the[350]
height of wanton folly, as the lads may be injured or
terrified to a serious degree. Remember, it is best
not to loose the dog at all if a man can be captured
without his help, and he should be muzzled
except in extreme cases. If a poacher who has had
his clothes torn and been bitten simply because he
ran away is brought before magistrates, he may
excite the pity of the latter, although he heartily
deserves condemnation from his judges; besides, a
civil action for damages may ensue.

"It is entirely through forgetfulness of these rules
that so many gentlemen object to night-dogs being
used on their estates. But, if an animal of this kind
is regarded in its proper light, and its use not abused,
its mere presence will do more to deter poaching than
the employment of half-a-dozen extra hands."

CHAPTER XV

THE GAMEKEEPERS' KENNEL ASSOCIATION

Concerning the Association

The Gamekeepers' Kennel Association has been
formed with the primary object of taking over the
organisation of the Gamekeepers' Dog Show as first
held at the Westminster Aquarium, on 31st July and
1st and 2nd August 1900, it being deemed advisable
by all parties concerned that the show should cease
to be proprietary or to be promoted by any firm
having trading interests with Gamekeepers. The
other aims which the Association has in view are
fully described in the following pages, and the
Executive will do everything in their power to uphold
and protect the rights of Game-preservers,
recognising that in this lie the best interests of the
Association and its members. The rule regarding
the exclusion of undesirable persons from membership
will be strictly enforced, and the Executive
hope, that in time, the fact that a Gamekeeper is a
member of the Association will be looked upon as a
proof of ability and good character.

[352]

Donations and Subscriptions in aid of the Funds
of the Association will be gladly received and
acknowledged by the Secretary. Cheques and Post-office
Orders should be made payable to the Gamekeepers'
Kennel Association and crossed "Barclay
&amp; Co." Secretary's address is:&mdash;

Mr F. W. Millard,
Hertford, Herts.


Rules

the Association five years or more shall, on retiring
from his duties as Gamekeeper through old age or
other physical incapacity, still be eligible for
membership.

[354]

15. That retired gamekeepers who wish to at once
become members of the Association, be eligible for
election at the option of the Committee.

16. That the annual subscription to be paid by
members be fixed at 5s. per annum for head-keepers
and single-handed-keepers, and 2s. 6d. per annum for
under-keepers.

17. That these subscriptions be considered due on
the 1st of January each year, and must be paid
before the 31st of that month.

18. That members wishing to join the Association
at any time other than the month of January must
pay the full subscription for the current year.

19. That all under-men wishing to join the Association
must be recommended by a head-keeper under
whom they have served.

20. That no head-keeper, after 31st December 1904,
shall be accepted as a member, without a recommendation
from his employer, or another head-keeper
who has already been enrolled.

21. That the Committee reserve the right to refuse
any application for membership, and also to expel
any member for any wilful misconduct which
they decide is detrimental to the objects of the
Association.

to obey the Rules and Regulations laid down by the
Kennel Club.

28. All new rules shall be framed and adopted in
Committee.

Rules for the Conduct of Meetings

1. That the dates and places of all meetings be

10. That the Committee from time to time make
such rules as they consider necessary for the Regulation
of the proceedings at their meetings.

Legal Bureau

Every member has a right to legal advice from the
Honorary Solicitor of the Association regarding any
matter connected with his duties. All applications
for such advice must be made through the Secretary,
and letters addressed direct to Mr Everitt will not
receive attention. This regulation is necessary to[357]
prevent outsiders seeking benefits reserved exclusively
for members. Mr Everitt is prepared to take legal
action on behalf of members and their employers at
recognised fees, and his great knowledge of the
intricacies of the Game Laws should ensure his
engagement in all difficult cases with reference to a
breach of these laws.

Veterinary Bureau

Every member of the Association has the privilege
of obtaining free veterinary advice on all matters
pertaining to his kennels, diseases of game, etc.
Applications must be sent through the Secretary of
the Association, a description of the symptoms,
duration of the disease, number of animals affected,
and any other information likely to be of service to
the expert when forming an opinion.

The Situation Register

The Executive of the Association will make every
effort to assist those of its members requiring situations,
and, for that purpose, advertisements will in
due season be inserted in certain papers asking
gentlemen requiring Gamekeepers to write to the
Secretary and state their wants. A register of
members out of place will be maintained at the
offices of the Association, and it is hoped that head-keepers[358]
requiring under-men will in all cases apply
to the Secretary before seeking elsewhere.

Directions to be followed by Members desirous of
obtaining a Situation through the Association

A member out of place wishing to be entered on
the Register of the Association must apply to the
Secretary for a form to fill up and return.

Each member in corresponding with the Secretary
must give his number, which number will be found
on his card of membership.

Should a member on the register obtain a situation
by other means, he must at once acquaint the
Secretary that he has been engaged.

Should a member be taken into the employment
of a gentleman or head-keeper, with whom he has
been placed in communication by the Secretary, he
must at once inform the Secretary, that his name may
be removed from the register.

Remarks

The Secretary will place members requiring situations
in communication with applicants for Gamekeepers
as fast as inquiries fall in, but in each case
the two parties must arrange their own terms. The
Executive will do their best to find suitable men for
the places offered, but they give no recommendation.
It is earnestly requested that members making a[359]
change will at once send their new address to the
Secretary.

The Register of Dogs for Sale

The Association maintains at its offices a register
of sporting dogs, belonging to its members, which are
for sale, and from time to time advertisements will
be placed in certain papers that dogs are on the
register for disposal. It will be the earnest endeavour
of the Executive to induce sportsmen, in
want of well-trained dogs, to apply to the Secretary,
and it is hoped that head-keepers requiring dogs will
purchase through the Association.

Directions for Placing a Dog upon the Register of
the Association

A member of the Association having a dog for sale
must write to the Secretary for a form on which the
animal and its capabilities may be described. When
the Secretary receives this form back the dog will be
entered upon the Register of the Association.

Each member in corresponding with the Secretary
must give his number, which number will be found
on his card of membership.

Should a dog upon the Register of the Association
be disposed of privately by its owner, he must
immediately inform the Secretary, that it may be
removed from the Register. Breaches of this order[360]
will be dealt with by the Committee, because endless
confusion and delay will ensue if it is not followed
out.

Beyond placing seller and purchaser in communication
with each other, the Association can accept no
responsibility.

Rules to be observed by both Parties when a Dog
goes on Trial

1. When an intending purchaser stipulates for a
trial, a dog must be in his hands four clear days, the
days of despatch and return not being counted.

2. The intending purchaser must be deemed responsible
for the dog's safety during the period
allowed for trial.

3. The carriage of a dog on the outward journey
must be paid by the person to whom it goes on
trial.

4. If a dog is returned after a trial as unsuitable,
its owner must pay carriage on the homeward
journey.

5. On a sale being concluded, the late owner of
the dog sold must immediately inform the Secretary.

6. If a dog after trial is returned as unsuitable, its
owner must at once inform the Secretary. Until he
has done this, no further measures for its sale will be
taken.

[361]

Notice

Gentlemen will much simplify the work of the
Secretary if, when requiring a dog, they explicitly
state their wants, and mention the price they are
prepared to give.

Remarks

The Executive hope that both parties to a transaction
will implicitly observe the foregoing rules and
directions. When filling up the forms, an exact
description of a dog and its capabilities should be
given; if misrepresentation is attempted, irretrievable
harm will be done to the Association and its objects.
Once sportsmen are assured that the Association is
a reliable source from which well-trained dogs may
be obtained, they will not fail to resort to it. By
observing the utmost care when filling in a form,
members will be protecting their own interests, aiding
the Executive, and enhancing the honour of the
Association.

Stud Dogs

That Gamekeepers may be encouraged to breed
true to the recognised types, the Secretary of the
Association will be glad to correspond with owners
of prize stud dogs with a view of securing a reduction
of fees in favour of members of the Association.
All members will be duly advised through[362]
The Gamekeeper of such reductions when they are
allowed, and the Executive hope that the efforts
they are making in this direction will be to the
advantage of both members and owners of stud dogs.
Members of the Association, who have valuable dogs,
are particularly requested to place them at the service
of other members for stud purposes.

Notice

The Secretary will be pleased to forward particulars
to members who are desirous of making
the Association known amongst their Gamekeeper
friends. It is hoped that each member will do his
best to add to the roll of the Association by inducing
others to join. Forms of application for intending
members may be obtained of the Secretary, who
will be glad to answer all inquiries.

A monthly report concerning the work and position
of the Association will be found in each issue of its
organ, The Gamekeeper.

A list of stud dogs, placed at the service of
members at reduced fees, is also occasionally
published in The Gamekeeper, copies of this paper
being obtainable from the Editor, Hertford, Herts.

Recently efforts have been made towards instituting
a fund for the benefit of keepers during later life.





[363]



CHAPTER XVI

Feeding Sporting Dogs

Amongst Masters of Hounds and breeders of other
Sporting Dogs, it is a general custom to feed the
animals but once a day, and in most instances this is
economical and satisfactory.

To maintain an even condition of the whole pack
is one of the best tests as to the huntsman's management
of the pack, and the kennelman's skill in feeding
them.

Like all other varieties of dogs, Hounds differ in
their likes and dislikes to food, so that whilst certain
members of the pack are thriving on the food set
before them, others are losing flesh, otherwise not
improving in condition. Another reason why one or
more of the Hounds may not be "doing well" is often
due to the weaker members being "snapped at" by
their stronger and peevish brethren when at the feeding
vessels. Observation will soon settle whether this
be the cause of particular hounds not thriving.

Shy feeders should either be allowed to have the
first cut at the food, or else fed by themselves, say[364]
two couples at one time. Horse-flesh and good oatmeal&mdash;or
some form of Hound meal&mdash;constitutes the
best staple food for Hounds. During the hot weather
the flesh requires to be boiled twice or thrice weekly.
As a substitute, skimmed milk can be used.

Nothing but sound horse-flesh ought to be used.
Cattle, sheep, or pigs, that have died suddenly&mdash;unless
certain that cause of death is of a harmless
nature&mdash;should be avoided.

There is a risk of the animals contracting anthrax,
deaths from this malady amongst dogs by no means
being unknown.

Tuberculous cattle are equally objectionable as food
for dogs.

In every instance the author recommends boiling
the flesh, so that no redness, or uncooked portions
remain.

The Hounds should be fed at least a couple of
hours before starting off. Nothing can be worse than
to run dogs with a full stomach.

Precisely the same remark applies to all other
Sporting Dogs, but to the working Hound in
particular.

The advantages of placing puppies "out at walk"
is, as in the past, largely carried out, and the system
leaves little to be desired. Most puppy walkers do
justice to their charges, but huntsmen and others will
do well to see that thin puppies are kept in fat conndition,[365]
and not low. The erroneous opinion, though so
general, that a puppy ought to be kept down in condition
when distemper is approaching, is the greatest
fallacy under the sun, and one that ought to have
exploded long ago.

My advice to "walkers" and to owners is to feed
your puppies well and get them fat, because distemper
will soon plough out their ribs, etc., if unfortunate
enough&mdash;as most of the good ones are&mdash;to
contract it.

A little black treacle (teaspoonful), mixed with
meal, rice, etc., and given once a week, is beneficial.
If too much be used, it makes the bowels loose,
especially after the dogs get warm with work, etc.

A change of food is of course desirable. Pointers,
Setters, Retrievers, Beagles, Terriers, etc., etc., may
have dry dog-biscuits&mdash;or soaked if preferred&mdash;given
to them in a morning, and soaked stale bread&mdash;with
water squeezed out&mdash;mixed with cut-up meat for the
evening meal.

Boiled (or raw) paunches make a splendid food for
dogs, and have great nutritive value. Boiled rice,
flour, and various other meals are suitable, only must
have a proportionable amount of flesh added to
them.

Many sportsmen believe that flesh destroys
a gundog's scenting power, and others that it makes
thin dogs hard-mouthed. The author cannot share[366]
this belief. For the satisfactory performance of
work, a dog must be allowed flesh, and shortness of
this&mdash;a dog's natural diet&mdash;is one of the chief causes
of so many dogs breaking out in skin eruptions.

In addition to good food, regularly given in suitable
quantities, it is necessary to see that the dogs have a
plentiful supply of pure water, but it is not a good
plan to give water immediately after feeding.

Another matter, in connection with feeding, that
gamekeepers, etc., will do well to bear in mind, is to
avoid feeding a dog on the entrails, etc., of rabbits and
hares&mdash;a fruitful source of worms.

Conditioning Dogs

First of all, let us ask the apparently simple
question, what is meant by "Condition?"

Our answer is: "The highest standard of
excellence for a given purpose."

To the uninitiated, it may seem a very simple
matter&mdash;only a question of plenty of food&mdash;to get a
dog into condition&mdash;or, we ought to say, with a good
layer of flesh upon his ribs.

But the huntsman, sportsman, and exhibitor
know different to this.

It is not merely a question of food, but one of
well-carried-out training&mdash;at anyrate in the eyes of
the two first-named.

[367]

Foxhounds, Harriers, Greyhounds, Beagles,
Otterhounds, Whippets, etc., must be "well winded,"
and this can only be obtained by daily exercise, first
on foot, and then on horseback, gradually increasing
the distance and pace.

The late Mr Apperley ("Nimrod") said: "That the
highest virtue in a Foxhound is his being true to
the line his game has gone, and a stout runner at
the end of the chase." In the words printed in
italics is embodied the term "Condition," as understood
by the huntsman and hound-master.

Accepting the statement as correct, it is not
necessary to say the amount of flesh a dog should
carry.

With the exhibitor, matters are rather different,
show condition being his desideratum.

If a sporting dog is going to a show, feed night
and morning on meat and bread, so that by the time
fixed for the show the ribs will have a good layer
of flesh over them, being felt in outline only when
the fingers are passed across them.

When a dog is very thin, give him a tablespoonful
of malt or cod-liver oil and malt, night and
morning.

Raw flesh will help matters greatly.

Before starting to lay on flesh by extra feeding,
oil, etc., it is generally advisable to satisfy oneself
that the dog is practically free from worms, otherwise[368]
the extra nourishment will be wasted. Try for
tape-worm with a dose of areca nut, and for round-worms,
three days afterwards, with 10 grains of
santonin, mixed with a dessertspoonful of treacle
and one tablespoonful of castor oil.

The use of a hound-glove, chamois leather, and
brush and comb, with an occasional bath, will do the
rest.

It is better to wash your dog several days before
the show, because the water destroys the natural
lubricant, or that making the hair glossy.

Curly-coated Retrievers are improved in tightness
of curl by the use of cold water.





[369]



CHAPTER XVII

Specific Ailments

Distemper&mdash;Rabies&mdash;Blood-Poisoning&mdash;Rheumatism
or Kennel Lameness

Under the title of "Specific" Ailments, the author
deems it advisable to give a brief account of such
diseases as distemper, blood-poisoning, rabies or madness,
rheumatism, kennel lameness, or chest founder,
these complaints having as their cause germs, or
micro-organisms; the production of these ailments&mdash;in
three of them at least&mdash;being due to the entrance
of minute organisms into the system, the excretions,
or poisonous products resulting in the several forms
of disease, as named above.

By far the commonest of these specific canine
ailments is&mdash;

DISTEMPER

This malady is only too well known amongst
owners and breeders of sporting dogs, and to its
almost constant presence in certain kennels the
rearing of puppies is seriously handicapped. It is
readily communicable from one dog to another&mdash;more[370]
particularly the young&mdash;either by direct or
indirect means.

Some kennels are singularly exempt from its
presence, whereas others are hardly ever without it.

In the latter case, the disease obviously exists
upon the premises, measures for its extinction having
been inadequately carried out.

One would hardly credit the multifarious channels
through which this canine scourge can be propagated.

Feeding utensils, benches, the hands and clothing
of attendants, hampers, collars and chains, bedding,
water vessels, by contact of the diseased and healthy,
and possibly by wind carrying the dessicated
discharges, are all liable to become active agents for
the production of the malady.

So varied is distemper in its method of attack,
that the most expert professional may ignore its
existence. Previous to the development of the
symptoms, there is the so-called period of incubation,
i.e., the time during which the germs are, as it were,
dormant, though in reality they are maturing, the
advent of their maturation being the development of
the specific lesions designated distemper. By far the
commonest manifestation of this horrible canine
scourge is that in connection with the mucous
membranes lining the eyelids, and upper air
passages.

[371]

Possibly these are the chief portals for the
entrance of the germs, and if the specific poison
would only confine its ravages to these regions, the
ultimate results would be of a much less serious
nature.

No amount of good government will confine the
assaults of the germs to positions so readily
accessible to amelioration by medicinal applications,
bronchial and pneumonic complications being
common results, or what is, equally severe,
bowels and brain lesions supervene, proving an
additional source of depleting an already weakened
economy. Masters of Foxhounds and proprietors of
other dogs, are, we fear, only too well acquainted
with the truth of this statement. The usual period
of incubation is from four to fourteen days, and this
should be borne in mind, so that any puppies that
have been in contact with the disease may be isolated,
and their temperatures taken for the next two or
three weeks night and morning. The normal
temperature is 101° Fahr. or a trifle over; therefore, if
the mercury rises above 102° Fahr. in the morning&mdash;more
particularly so&mdash;this is sufficient to warrant
the animal's separation from the rest of the
puppies.

It has been stated that distemper may exist
without any rise of temperature, or even the
presence of catarrhal signs, but the author does[372]
not attach the slightest importance to such statements,
and claims an experience equal to that of
any other veterinary expert.

If there is no rise of temperature, no prostration,
and no catarrhal signs, one may at once conclude
that the animal is not affected with distemper.

Dulness, loss of appetite, sneezing, redness, heaviness
of the eyes, slight husky cough, and, it may be,
vomiting, are the premonitory signs of distemper.

If temperature be taken in the rectum or vagina,
it will probably be about 103° or 104° Fahr.&mdash;the
best positive evidence. There will generally be
either constipation&mdash;more especially if a young dog&mdash;or
an opposite condition of the evacuations. One
well-known M.R.C.V.S. believes that distemper in
adult dogs is of very rare occurrence.

This is not the author's experience, he having
encountered and treated numerous cases when the
animals have had distinct attacks of distemper two,
and three times. Like scarlatina, measles, small-pox,
etc., in the human subject, once the patient has
passed through a well-marked attack of the disease,
it is to a great extent "protected," but certainly not
immune, to succeeding ones.

There is indisputable evidence in support of this
statement, even the oldest observers being aware of
its truth.

Following upon the preliminary symptoms already[373]
indicated, there is a profuse discharge from the
nasal and ocular openings, at first watery in character,
subsequently creamy.

The discharge (unless cleaned off) irritates the
margin of the eyes, occluding these and the nasal
openings.

Sometimes the malady remains in this&mdash;the so-called
simple or catarrhal form&mdash;for several days, and
then convalescence begins.

In the case of coarse-bred dogs (mongrels, etc.) the
foregoing is the usual condition of affairs. Bronchial
and lung troubles are frequent, and probably more
puppies die from the broncho-pneumonia of distemper
than from other causes. Bronchitis is indicated
by frequent attempts at expectoration, and the
so-called "rale," heard within the chest. This
sound is due to the air passing through the
inflammatory exudate in the tubes. If pleurisy is
present, there will, during the earlier stages, be
friction or dry rubbing sounds, heard when the ear is
placed against the chest wall. It is generally
associated with varying degrees of pneumonia, either
single or double. Quick breathing&mdash;more especially
noticeable in the region of the flanks&mdash;is the best
guide as to its presence for the amateur physician.
Dropsy of the chest is not at all an uncommon
result of pleuritic inflammation.

When consolidation of the lungs has taken[374]
place, their respiratory usefulness becomes materially
interfered with, so that, frequently, the
animal has to make use of his lips as an auxiliary,
the cheeks being inflated in a spasmodic manner.
Recovery in this advanced condition of disease is
exceedingly rare, though we have known it occur.

Pericardial (heart sac) inflammation is not uncommon
in distemper, resulting through extension of
inflammation from the pleural membranes.

A disordered liver is indicated by yellowness of
the skin and mucous membranes, this bilious or
hepatic form of the complaint being fairly common.

A fetid breath and pustular eruption over the
belly, and on the skin inside the thighs are commonly
observed; in fact, the pustular eruption is the
most significant sign one can find.

Its presence is at once demonstrative that the
animal is affected with what is known to the professional
as a specific eruptive fever, which will run
a definite course, and no amount of medicinal agents
can cut it short.

One may control it by good nursing, suitable
surroundings, and the judicious use of medicinal
agents, but for any man to say that it is within
his power to stay its normal progress, would, we
opine, be bordering on madness. So much for
distemper cures and their curers.

Ordinary small-pox vaccine has been employed[375]
as a preventative for distemper. Almost everyone
knows that when the arm of the human subject is
scarified with the lancet, so as to admit the reception
of the vaccine into the system, the part becomes
inflamed and swollen, the seat of vaccination also
showing a vesicle, etc., typical of a mild form of
the disease, and if this does not take place the
vaccine is said not to have "taken," i.e., it has done
no good.

This is exactly what happens when used in the
same way upon the dog, there being neither inflammation
nor yet other signs, typical of local reaction,
therefore it can be no use.

The mere fact of the disease never having occurred
in a certain dog that has been vaccinated is not
the least evidence in support of its utility.

Many dogs are very refractory to certain diseases,
amongst these being distemper.

The Commission of Veterinary Surgeons, appointed
to inquire into the utility of Dr Physalix's Vaccine,
has convinced the writer that it was a failure
from beginning to end, and he advises all dog
admirers, Masters of Hounds, etc., to steer clear of
its use.

There is no doubt that in course of time an
anti-toxin, or some other attenuated form of
distemper virus will be produced for the cure,
or prevention of, this deadly canine malady.

[376]

Regarding the treatment of distemper, it has
been suggested that a dose of castor oil may, with
advantage, be given at the outset.

The author does not consider this advisable: the
oil, owing to its extremely nauseating properties,
tends to further weaken the animal by the
production of vomition, etc. Moreover, castor oil
leaves the bowels in a drier condition than before&mdash;an
undesirable effect.

A soft&mdash;not dysenteric&mdash;condition of the evacuations
is advantageous, much of the poison being
got rid by the alimentary canal in this way.

A moist condition of the bowels is best maintained
by the daily use of some of the natural aperient
waters, such as Apenta, Hunyadi-Janos, etc., given
in small doses once a day; say, every morning,
taking particular care not to go too far.

The superiority of these saline aperients to those
of oleaginous and other resinous purgatives, is
further evidenced by the fact that they also act
as febrifuges, lowering the excessive heat, thus
diminishing the rapid loss of flesh, so characteristic
of this affection.

For the husky cough give from one teaspoonful
to a tablespoonful of ipecacuanha wine, just as it
is. This should induce vomiting, and ought not to
be repeated, at least for several days.

As a rule, very satisfactory results follow its use.[377]
Inhalations of turpentine, eucalyptus, and spirit of
camphor, or a little menthol, are exceedingly
beneficial.

Four teaspoonfuls of each of the three first-named
may be mixed together, and then one teaspoonful
added to half a pint of boiling water, the dog being
made to inhale the steam.

Five to ten drops of oil of eucalyptus, mixed with
a little fine sugar, and placed inside the mouth night
and morning, is good for the catarrhal symptoms of
distemper, and the author can, from experience,
recommend its employment.

When chest complications are marked, the
application of mustard paste to the sides will do
good.

Put the fore and hind limbs through holes cut in
a thick piece of woollen blanket, and fasten it
over the back. This will keep the chest warm
and prevent the mustard from being rubbed off, more
especially if a bit of brown paper be interposed.

Stimulants are indispensable in distemper, so that
bovril, claret, and brandy are required. Brand's
Essence is the best for nourishment. Give it in
teaspoonful doses every hour. One may add the
same quantity of brandy or whisky to it.

Bovril is a good stimulant in distemper, but
it will certainly make the dog vomit, unless
given in very small quantities, so long as the stomach[378]
is in an irritable condition, one or two tablespoonfuls
each time being quite sufficient.

As restoratives, claret and Coca Wine are excellent.

When dysenteric symptoms are troublesome, give
an injection into the rectum night and morning.
Use two to six tablespoonfuls of tepid boiled
starch, to which ½ drachm of laudanum, 10
drops of turpentine and 1 drachm of tincture of
hamamaledin has been added, injecting the lot, and
then keeping the dog very still until the discomfiture
of the injection has subsided.

In addition to this, from 5 to 15 grains
of grey powder may be given, and repeated in
the doses first named, daily. If no improvement,
give 10 grains of powdered ipecacuanha every 10
hours.

To relieve the congested condition of the liver,
the use of hot linseed and mustard poultices over
the organ will be of service, followed by 10 to
20 grains of sal ammoniac, along with 5 grains
of hyposulphite of soda, given in a tablespoonful of
water night and morning.

Most reliance must be placed upon careful nursing,
and if this is properly carried out better may be the
issue, though, as already stated, no amount of
careful nursing, or use of medicinal agents, will
stop the ravages of distemper.

[379]

Fits are frequent, and another very common
result is chorea, or St Vitus' dance, also called
the twitch, jumps, etc. For fits, give 20 grains
of bromide of potash, and if this does no good,
double the dose, and for chorea try a course
of Easton's Syrup&mdash;in capsules&mdash;malt, cod-liver
oil, etc. Paralysis is not an uncommon sequel.

Dialysed iron&mdash;10-drop doses in a tablespoonful
of water&mdash;is a very satisfactory drug to use so as
to restore the weakened constitution, and bring back
the appetite after distemper.

RABIES

Although not present in our own country, it is
very prevalent in certain provinces in India, etc.

The muzzling order and quarantine has been
the means of abolishing this deadly malady from
England.

In ninety-nine per cent. of cases in India, the
disease is directly due to animals left to stray from
the bazaars and villages.

At one time rabies was very prevalent in England,
therefore cases of hydrophobia were not infrequent.
Moreover other animals (horses, sheep, cattle,
deer, etc.) had the malady through having been
bitten by a rabid dog.

This disease assumes two distinct forms, one[380]
known as the "furious" and the other "dumb" rabies.
One of the earliest indications of rabies is an
alteration of the dog's manner. He becomes restless,
quarrelsome, and shy, having a strong inclination
to wander from home.

At first the animal is able to drink, but very
shortly he is unable, though evidently willing to
do so. A depraved appetite is a singularly constant
feature of rabies, gnawing at wood and snapping
at imaginary (also real) objects.

A rabid dog has no particular inclination to
seek objects for revenge; the injuries he inflicts
beings agents that he regards as intercepting his
onward march.

The author had, some years since, considerable
experience amongst cases of rabies, and often innocent
owners would bring rabid dogs for treatment!!

A very characteristic&mdash;though we cannot say
pathognomonic&mdash;sign of rabies, is an alteration in
the bark, and this is changed to a semi-bark and
howl, easily recognised when heard a second time.

A rabid dog generally knows his master until overcome
by the fury of the disease.

Most dogs succumb within a week after the
advent of the first signs of the complaint. From a
week to three months may be set down as the
minimum and maximum periods for the development
(incubation) of rabies, after the dog[381]
has been bitten by a rabid animal, or received
the virus of the malady into its system, such as
might occur through rubbing, licking, etc., upon a
mucous surface.

There are many other minor signs of rabies, and
in the so-called "dumb" form, the most diagnostic
one is dropping of the lower jaw, accompanied by a
snuffling sound.

Although this latter might be confused with
paralysis of the lower jaw from injury to the nerve,
etc., the history of the case will afford the most
reliable guide, when forming an opinion.

If rabies is suspected, isolation and destruction
should be carried out at once. The speedier the
better.

Before concluding, the writer wishes to say that
the bite of a dog in ordinary health is no more
injurious than a wound inflicted by any other means,
and that the sooner this stupid fallacy explodes the
better for beast and man.

To destroy a healthy dog because it happens to
have bitten a person is akin to madness.

BLOOD-POISONING

This is almost always due to absorption of septic
matter, usually from the seat of a wound or other
injury. We have frequently seen it follow a bite
from another dog. It is generally fatal. The[382]
skin assumes a bluish tint, and beneath it inflammatory
products accumulate, giving, when
pressed with the fingers, a crackling sensation.

In other instances, abscesses form both internally
and externally, sometimes the whole of a limb being
infiltrated with pus, etc.

Very little can be done.

To support the severe depression, give brandy,
eggs, and Brand's Essence of Beef. Also 25
grains of salicylate of soda every six hours in a
little cold water.

RHEUMATISM OR KENNEL LAMENESS

Masters of Hounds and Sporting-dog men in
particular, are nearly all acquainted with this
troublesome complaint.

Where dogs are kenneled on damp or low-lying
ground, there may we expect to find kennel lameness&mdash;a
title under which it has been known for
many and many a score of years.

A previous attack is a predisposing influence to
its recurrence.

Rheumatism may be either acute or chronic.

Although not common in its acute form, the
writer has treated dogs that could hardly bear anyone
to enter&mdash;much less shake&mdash;the rooms where
they have been kept, the slightest shake causing the
dog to howl from the agony of pain so induced.

[383]

Under these circumstances, the diagnosis of
rheumatism becomes a certainty, much more so
than in its chronic condition, when confined to a
limb, joint, etc.

The muscles of the chest&mdash;Chest-founder&mdash;and
the neck, are commonly affected.

Stiffness and difficulty in moving&mdash;the dog often
suddenly howling from pain&mdash;are the chief signs.
There is not much (if any) swelling in this complaint,
as it occurs in the dog.

The shifting character of rheumatism is a great
aid to diagnosis.

Treatment.&mdash;Keep dog in a dry and warm kennel.

Don't wash, especially in winter.

Give soda water to drink.

For the chronic manifestation of the affection,
administer 5 grains of iodide of potash night and
morning.

Open bowels with a purgative.

If acute, 20 grains of salicylate of soda every
eight hours in a tablespoonful of water.

Rub the muscles with some stimulating liniment,
such as white oil, belladonna, or aconite liniments.

Feed on soft food and nurse dog well.

Many cases of rheumatism never get any better,
the dog remaining a confirmed cripple, though worse
in damp weather.





[384]



CHAPTER XVIII

Constitutional Skin Diseases

Eczema&mdash;Boils&mdash;Herpes&mdash;Nettle-rash

ECZEMA

This is a very common complaint, indeed much more
so than need be if proper attention were paid to
the feeding and exercising of dogs.

That eczema is of a hereditary nature there seems
abundant evidence to prove, the progeny of
eczematous parents predisposing the offspring to
suffer&mdash;when the exciting cause comes into play&mdash;in
a like manner. Derangement of the digestive organs
and impaired nerve force must be reckoned as chief
amongst such causes.

Sarcoptic mange and certain other parasites are of
course capable of producing eczema, but this is chiefly
mechanical irritation, ceasing with the destruction
of the irritant.

Not so, however, with eczema of a constitutional
nature, the irritation requiring internal medication
for its subjugation.

Eczema is denoted by the appearance of one or[385]
more patches of inflamed skin, and unless checked,
the whole of the skin may become inflamed, the hairs
broken and shed, reducing the dog to a condition of
misery and suffering.

Any portion of the body or extremities are the seats
of eruption, but where the parts can be licked or
scratched by the dog, the worse the zone of inflammation.

In the moist form of eczema small vesicles appear;
the rupture of these and the dessication of their contents,
along with scales, hair, etc., forms a scab or
crust on the surface.

Many sporting (and other) dogs have a dry form of
eczema known as Psoriasis, showing itself upon the
points of the elbows and buttocks.

Here the patches are very intractable, the skin
having a dry and leathery appearance.

Between the toes, around the eyelids, margins of
the ears, are common situations for eczema to make
its appearance.

Treatment.&mdash;This must be both local, i.e., applied
to the diseased part or parts, and general, i.e., directed
towards improving the constitution.

Plenty of exercise and a reasonable supply of
good, sound, boiled flesh, mixed with bread, night and
morning, will do much towards a cure.

Give a bath of sulphurated potash (2 ounces of
sulphate of potash to 6 gallons of water) weekly, dry[386]
thoroughly and then dress the parts with sulphur
ointment, or boracic acid ointment.

If the disease has spread more, or less, over the
whole skin, dress with the following liniment.



 
  &#8478;
  Paraffin oil
  4 ounces
 

 
  &nbsp;
  Sulphur flowers
  4 ounces
 

 
  Oil of tar
  2 ounces
 

 
  Olive oil
  30 ounces
 



Mix. Wash off in six days' time, and repeat once
every ten days until cured.

N.B.&mdash;A cheap oil (rape, colza, etc.), can be substituted
for the olive oil, though these are all distinctly
inferior for the purpose.

In addition to the treatment, give the dog a
5-grain blue pill, say once every three or four
weeks, and have the following mixture compounded.



 
  &#8478;
  Liquid extract of sacred bark
  2 drachms
 

 
  &nbsp;
  Acetate of potash
  1 drachm
 

 
  Ammoniated citrate of iron
  1 drachm
 

 
  Tincture of orange
  1 ounce
 

 
  Fowler's Solution of Arsenic
  80 drops
 

 
  Water to 8 ounces
 



Directions: Give one tablespoonful night and
morning before food. Several weeks' or months'
treatment will be required ere a complete cure can
be anticipated.

Mild cases of eczema are not difficult to bring[387]
under control, but those of long-standing demand
perseverance. If skin scaly, use tar ointment daily.

BOILS

A common situation for these to make their appearance
is upon or between the toes.

Frequently they are very troublesome, appearing
and reappearing.

The best treatment is to poultice freely with hot
linseed meal, and if at all tardy in healing, paint
with Friar's Balsam.

Keep feet very clean, soaking in hot water at each
time of removal of poultice.

Give a dose of Epsom salts, and don't allow dog to
run about without a leather boot for a few days, or
at anyrate until the sores have become perfectly
healed. A little powdered boracic acid powder can be
dusted upon the sore places. For drawing sores
turpentine ointment is very useful.

HERPES

By this term we mean an eruption of vesicles
or small blisters in groups upon an inflamed skin.
These blisters are larger than those of eczema.
It is not uncommon to see them around the lips
during an attack of distemper, causing the mouth to
become extremely sore and painful. In ringworm,
the patch is of a kindred nature, though contagious.

[388]

NETTLE-RASH

This complaint is characterised by the sudden
appearance of numerous wheals or elevations upon
various parts of the skin, causing a burning and
itching sensation, provoking the dog to bite and
scratch the parts affected.

Generally these wheals disappear as suddenly as
they came, though now and again some are very
stationary.

The best treatment comprises the administration
of a 5-grain blue pill and the application of a little
vinegar and water to the irritable patches.





[389]



CHAPTER XIX

External Parasites and Parasitic Skin Diseases

Fleas&mdash;Pediculi or Lice&mdash;Ringworm&mdash;Sarcoptic
Mange&mdash;Follicular Mange

FLEAS

During the warm weather more particularly,
fleas are a source of great annoyance to dogs, and
frequently to their owners, more especially if the
animal be kept in the house.

Owing to the rapid multiplication of fleas, dogs
that are not regularly groomed or washed, soon
become swarmed with these pests, consequently the
severe irritation they produce upon the skin causes
the animal to lose condition, whilst the scratching
and biting destroys its coat. Regularity of washing,
both dog and kennel, constitutes the best means of
checking these pests.

Wash all woodwork with boiling water and Stone
Ammonia, then expose to air.

Turpentine is a capital thing to sprinkle the kennel,
benches, etc., with. Fleas seem to dislike this drug
more than any other agent we have employed.

A very good dressing for destroying fleas is composed[390]
of an ounce each of turpentine and terebene,
dissolved in a pint of methylated spirits of wine.

PEDICULI OR LICE (PHTHIRIASIS)

Whenever dogs get into this condition, it is reasonable
to conclude that there has been a want of
proper attention.

One may go further, by saying that it is generally
the outcome of neglect, and a lousy dog should only
be found in the kennel of the sluggard, no matter
whatever be the source of infection. Detection at
an exhibition leads to exclusion, and rightly so.

The eggs or "nits" are attached firmly to the shafts
of the hairs close to the root, and hatch in about
five days after being deposited.

Any part of the body may be the seat of these
parasites, but those parts where the hairy covering is
dense, constitute the most favourable cover.

Loss of condition soon follows the invasion.

Treatment.&mdash;Use the brush and comb freely. Scrub
all kennel fittings with strong decoction of tobacco.

Dress dog with the following:&mdash;



 
  &#8478;
  Oil of Stavesacre
  1 ounce
 

 
  &nbsp;
  Olive Oil
  14 ounces
 



Mix and rub in with a stiff brush.

An infusion of quassia is an excellent and harmless
remedy.

Buy 4d. of quassia chips, and add a quart of[391]
boiling water, with the addition of half an ounce of
shag tobacco, infusing for six hours. Dress dog all
over, rubbing well into "under" coat, if dog has one.

Dog ticks may be snipped off with scissors.

RINGWORM

Although now and then affected with ringworm,
the dog does not suffer from the skin disease anything
like so commonly as cattle.

The chief variety seen upon the dog is that induced
by the vegetable parasite, Tricophyton tonsurans,
which assumes a circular, or shield-like form. Honeycomb
ringworm is another variety. The patch is
about an inch long as a rule, scaly, and shows the
hairs broken across, giving it a stubbly appearance.
It is easily recognised.

Ringworm can be readily transferred from one
dog to another, or to animals of different species, and
the converse.

Treatment.&mdash;Paint the bare patch or patches with
iodine liniment; groom well and feed well. Keep
dog away from others until cured.

SARCOPTIC MANGE

This is a very common form of mange, though
often confused with non-parasitic eczema.

The mange mite is known as Sarcoptes canis, and[392]
takes up its abode upon the superficial dermoid
structures.

The irritation thus induced, causes the dog to bite
and scratch the part, ending in the production of a
raw, weeping surface, extending from point to point,
unless something is done to check the ravages of the
mites. With licking, biting and scratching, these
parasites are transferred as indicated, and an artificial
form of eczema induced.

The diagnosis can be confirmed by microscopic
examination of the under surfaces of the crusts upon
the sores.

Treatment.&mdash;Being contagious, keep the diseased
dog from healthy ones until cured.

All fittings, clothing, and other appliances likely to
have been in contact with the diseased dog ought to
be thoroughly scalded with boiling water and soda.

Short-coated dogs are more readily curable than
heavily-coated varieties.

Wash dog twice weekly, and after thoroughly
drying, dress all over with a dressing, composed of
4 ounces of flowers of sulphur, ½ ounce of oil of
tar, and a pint of train, or colza oil.

This dressing should be washed off in about three
or four days, and repeated until cured.

A bath of sulphurated potash is a capital remedy.

Add an ounce of sulphurated potash to every ten
gallons of tepid water.

[393]

In some instances it is advisable to clip the dog,
thus facilitating the penetration of the dressing.

Almost every kennel man and doggy man has his
so-called mange cure, but the first principles are to
make a diagnosis of the complaint under which the
animal is labouring.

FOLLICULAR MANGE

This is a very intractable variety of mange, resulting
from the invasion of the hair-follicles by a
minute mite, known as Demodex folliculorum, easily
recognisable on microscopic examination. It is of
lobster-like shape.

It will readily be understood that the inaccessible
habitats of these mites renders the effective application
of medicinal agents at a disadvantage.

Destruction of the roots of the hairs is a common
result, and a permanent bare patch often remains as a
legacy of the parasitic attack.

Like the sarcoptic, follicular mange is transferable
from one dog to another, though less readily than
the former.

Bare patches should be shaved all around, and the
part painted with colourless tincture of iodine daily,
or twice daily.

The most satisfactory way of dealing with this
complaint is to consult a qualified veterinary
surgeon.





[394]



CHAPTER XX

Diseases of the Gullet, Stomach, Bowels,
and Digestive Glands

Disease of Gullet&mdash;Inflammation of Stomach&mdash;Twist
and Intussusception of the Bowels&mdash;Inflammation
of the Bowels&mdash;Vomiting&mdash;Worms&mdash;Diarrhœa&mdash;Dysentery&mdash;Hæmorrhage&mdash;Hæmorrhoids&mdash;Dyspepsia&mdash;Jaundice
or Yellow&mdash;Ruptures.

GULLET

This begins at the back part of the mouth, the
entrance into it is known as the pharynx, and ends
at the stomach.

Stricture, or narrowing of the gullet, and injury to
it, such as sometimes produced by the dog swallowing
a sharp-pointed body, is not an uncommon
accident.

External compression, such as the presence of a
morbid growth in juxtaposition to the gullet, is
capable of interfering with the functional use of the
tube, thereby preventing the animal from swallowing
properly.

[395]

Diseases of the gullet always demand the exercise
of professional skill, and until this is obtained, nothing
beyond trifling amounts of liquid nourishment
ought to be given.

INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH (GASTRITIS)

Probably the most frequent cause of gastric inflammation
in the dog is that arising through the ingestion
of irritant poisons, such as arsenic, antimony, etc.

Less frequently an inflamed stomach is due to the
presence of worms, or to the specific poison of distemper:
in the latter case the areas of disease generally
being of an extensive nature.

The chief symptoms of stomach inflammation are
vomiting; pain in the belly; prostration; thirst, and
other signs of the dog being in a critical condition.

Treatment must be in accordance with the cause.

TWIST OR STRANGULATION; AND INTUSSUSCEPTION OF
THE BOWELS

Neither of these morbid conditions are of uncommon
occurrence amongst dogs, more especially so in young
dogs, but why this should be so, is difficult of explanation.

A twisted bowel is certainly not so frequently met
with as a telescoped or intussuscepted one. In both
cases inflammation is set up, chiefly confined to the[396]
area involved, or in those parts in juxtaposition to the
lesion.

Practically speaking, one issue is the rule in both
cases, and that is death.

Spontaneous reduction is rare, and as the diagnosis
is attended with difficulty, relief by operation seldom
attempted.

The true nature of these bowel complaints is
generally only revealed on after-death examination.

INFLAMMATION OF THE BOWELS

We have already alluded to this in the previous
paragraph, but inflammation of the bowels also arises
from other than the causes therein named.

In the author's opinion, the most frequent causes of
this complaint in puppies are round-worms (Ascaris
marginata).

To avoid puppies being troubled with these
parasites, small quantities of lime-water are of
service. A tablespoonful will be sufficient at once.

Teaspoonful doses of Brand's Essence of Beef constitutes
one of the very best substances that can be
used when vomition is troublesome, and later on
the yolk of an egg, with the addition of a teaspoonful
of brandy.

As a medicinal agent, bismuth is particularly useful,[397]
so that the following mixture should be obtained
from the chemist:&mdash;



 
  &#8478;
  Carbonate of bismuth
  3 drachms
 

 
  &nbsp;
  Pepsin
  30 grains
 

 
  Bromide of potash
  2 drachms
 

 
  Bicarbonate of soda
  3 drachms
 

 
  Compound tincture of cardamoms
  1 ounce
 

 
  Water to make
  4 ounces
 



Mix. Dose: One tablespoonful every four hours
until the vomiting ceases. For Terriers, etc., half this
dose will suffice.

This mixture will be found specially suitable for
the vomiting of distemper, and when arising from
other causes, of a general nature. In case the dog has
been poisoned or picked up some material of an
objectionable nature, it may not be advisable to
try and check the vomiting. Under these circumstances,
it must be regarded as a salutary process. It
is only when it becomes excessive that it is advisable
to stop it.

Another very important matter when dealing with
a case of excessive vomition, is that of keeping the
dog as quiet as possible, together with the application
of hot, dry flannels, applied over the belly for several
hours at a time, and continued with until improvement
sets in.

The bitch should be thoroughly dosed with worm
medicine before she comes into season, otherwise[398]
repeated purgation by worm medicine may have a
prejudicial influence after service. Refusing to suck
and crying from the pain in the belly are the surest
indications of this condition in suckers. In adult dogs
irritant poisons are not at all an uncommon cause of
inflammation of the bowels. The specific poison of
distemper is another cause. External injuries will
produce it, and probably exposure to severe wet, such
as lying on a damp kennel floor. Peritonitis is a
frequent accompaniment. It is generally fatal, therefore
the best of skill should be obtained. Hot
fomentations and 15-to 20-drop doses of chlorodyne
every three hours can be tried in the meantime.

VOMITING

The dog finds vomiting the readiest means of
ejecting objectionable substances from within its
stomach, and consequently many medicinal agents
are conveniently&mdash;sometimes inconveniently&mdash;got rid
of by this means.

Even this ready means does not safeguard our
canine friends against death from the ingestion of
various poisonous agents, though doubtless this prompt
action of the stomach in response to stimulation of
the vomiting centre in the brain, does confer a certain
degree of immunity against toxic substances. Rapidity
of absorption has an important bearing in this respect,
such deadly agents as strychnine being absorbed by[399]
the stomach, passing into the circulation to other
vital organs in a very rapid manner.

During distemper, vomiting is common, its frequent
repetition being an additional exhausting factor in
this malady.

To avoid this, minute quantities of readily assimilable
nourishment is essential.

When the ejected material is stained with blood or
actually contains blood as blood, it points to ulceration
of the lining membrane of the stomach&mdash;a condition
of gravity.

Stoppage of the bowels is often followed by
vomiting, and frequently brings on paralysis.

Treatment for Vomition.&mdash;Rest for the stomach
is one of the first essentials of treatment. Nourishment
must be given, and, if necessary, this can be in
the form of nutrient enemas. (See Clysters.)

Fatty substances, milk, vegetables, and solid food,
must be rigidly excluded until such time as the organ
has regained its tone and proper power of assimilating
the nutritive pabulum supplied. Soda-water to
drink and 20 grains of powdered bismuth three
times a day, along with a tablespoonful of the
soda-water. If dog is paralytic give it an enema.

WORMS

Although fairly common in other situations,[400]
worms are most frequently found infesting the
intestines and stomach.

The cavities of the heart, nasal and respiratory
passages, cranial cavity, and bile-duct are more rarely
the seats of parasitic invasion in the dog. When
the heart and respiratory tubes are affected, the
parasites are of a minute, thread-like character,
hence known as Filaria, or thread-worms.

The flat, lancet-shaped worm, sometimes found up
the nose, is spoken of as a trematode; the round-worms
in the stomach and bowels as nematodes;
whilst the other long, flat, or tape-like worms, are
called Tænia.

Very few dogs are entirely free from worms of
one sort or another, though it is only when these
become numerous that the dog shows signs of
having these pests.

Gradual loss of condition, irregular appetite,
irregular evacuations, harsh coat, sometimes vomiting,
and increased redness of the membranes lining the
eyelids, are the usual signs, significant of internal
parasites. Positive proof is of course the passage of
segments of tape-worms, or round-worms, either by
vomiting, or in the evacuations.

Sneezing and a catarrhal discharge from the nose is
generally present when the nasal passages are infested
with the lancet-shaped worms already alluded to.
An uncommon true blood-sucking worm (Spiroptera[401]
sanguinolenta) is occasionally found in the
stomach.

Newly-born puppies seem predisposed to become
infected with round-worms, known as Ascaris
marginata, such infection taking place from the
dam, hence the necessity for ridding her of worms,
and the most suitable time to administer vermifuge
medicine, in an efficacious manner, is prior to her
coming in season.

With reference to the preventative measures
against worm infestation, speaking practically, not a
great deal can be done, the sources of infection being
so varied. Feeding dogs on the viscera of animals
must of course be condemned, and with the abolition
of this practice so will diminish one source of infection.
Many so-called worm specifics are now largely
advertised, rival proprietors claiming superiority and
even infallibility.

Some of these nostrums are given without fasting
the dog, but said to be equally efficacious. This
statement must be accepted with reservation, as all
worm medicines act more energetically when the
stomach and bowels are empty. Before administering
worm medicine, it is advisable to fast adult dogs
for twenty-four hours, but puppies should not be
kept longer than fifteen hours without food.

Although an old, but well-tried remedy against
both round and flat worms, areca nut still maintains[402]
its position, and rightly so, because when given in
suitable doses, and in accordance with the old rules,
it seldom fails to give a satisfactory account of its
action.

The freshly grated nut has advantages over the
powder, more especially if the latter has been kept in
stock for a considerable time, as usually happens
where the demand for a certain drug is limited.
When combined with santonin, its action on round-worms
is greatly enhanced.

Areca nut, santonin, and male fern, are now all
sold in capsular form, thus diminishing their nauseating
effects.

The average dose of areca nut for such breeds as
Pointers, Setters, Retrievers, Fox and other Hounds,
is a drachm and a half, combined with 8 grains
of santonin, and given as a bolus mixed with honey,
treacle, etc., or in a little milk, though less liable to
be vomited when given without any liquid.

About three hours afterwards give a full dose of
castor oil.

Repeat weekly, for a month if needful. A course
of tonic medicine may then follow, so as to brace up
the constitution.

Such substances as powdered glass and other
mechanical irritants ought to be avoided, being liable
to set up gastro-enteritis. Powdered tin, glass, etc.,
belong to this class. Calomel, hellebore, pomegranate[403]
bark, spirit of turpentine, Barbadoes tar, garlic,
wormwood, Kousso, Kamala, etc., have been, and still
are, much used, and abused.

Whatever be the drug employed, it is advisable to
isolate dog both before and after dosing, so that the
results can be properly noted.

Through neglect of this precaution, many failures or
indifferent results arise.

The indiscriminate employment of worm medicines
is but too frequently resorted to, and may further
deplete an already exhausted system.

In many instances, a course of iron and arsenic
tonics, followed by cod-liver oil and malt, does more
good than the administration of anti-worm remedies.

DIARRHŒA

Like almost every other animal, the dog is a frequent
sufferer from a too loose condition of the
evacuations, constituting diarrhœa.

A variety of causes are capable of bringing this
about, but the presence of worms, cold, feeding on
liver and other unsuitable foods, are, in all probability
the most frequent causes.

During distemper, superpurgation is a frequent sign,
calling for active but well-regulated treatment to
control it.

It must be borne in mind that this excessive discharge[404]
of liquid fæces is but symptomatic of derangement
of the stomach, bowels, or digestive glands, and
that it can only be successfully treated when viewed
in this light, the administration of diarrhœa mixtures
being often a failure, because these facts are ignored.

A little careful consideration will often determine
the cause, the discharge ceasing with its removal.

In other instances it can only be conjectured,
treatment becoming speculative.

Boiled rice and milk, arrowroot and milk, to which
two or three tablespoonfuls of port wine has been
added, constitutes suitable dietary whilst the evacuations
are in a fluid, or semi-fluid state.

When arising through a chill, or the animal becoming
overheated, the following mixture can, with
benefit, be used:&mdash;



 
  &#8478;
  Rubini's Essence of Camphor
  1 drachm
 

 
  &nbsp;
  Chlorodyne
  2 drachms
 



Mix, and give 25 drops three times per day, along
with a tablespoonful of cold arrowroot gruel.

Diarrhœa arising through the irritation of unsuitable
food in the stomach and bowels must be treated
as follows:&mdash;

1. Give a full dose of castor oil, along with 20
drops of laudanum.

2. After this has had time to work itself out, follow
up with doses of the diarrhœa mixture, as sold by
chemists for the human subject.

[405]

DYSENTERY

When diarrhœa is allowed to continue, it is liable
to end with dysenteric symptoms, the lower end of
the bowel becoming implicated, producing bloodstained
evacuations, or the disease may be of a specific
nature from the beginning.

No matter how arising, dysentery is an exhausting
disease, and one that demands prompt treatment for
its alleviation.

Internally, powdered ipecacuanha is the best
remedy, and it should be given.

First give an injection of tepid water (½ to 1½ pints)
to wash out the bowel, and then administer from 5 to
20 grains of the above drug, mixed with the same
quantity of bicarbonate of soda, in a tablespoonful
of honey and water. Repeat in eight hours.

Give no food, and keep dog very quiet for next
twenty-four hours.

Injections of starch gruel and laudanum are often
very useful for dysentery, and can be used twice
daily.

Twenty to 60 drops of laudanum may be added to
a couple of tablespoonfuls of tepid boiled starch,
then injected into the lower end of the bowel by
means of a vulcanite, glass, or ball syringe.

Particular attention must, of course, be paid to the
animal's diet.

[406]

Nothing but farinaceous foods should be allowed
unless it be Brand's Essence, or some stimulating
liquid, such as bovril or Oxo, to which isinglass has
been added. If pain severe, apply hot poultices to
the belly.

HÆMORRHAGE

Loss of blood may arise either from within or without
the body, be of varying amount, and either
arterial, venous, or capillary.

Excessive hæmorrhage is of course always
injurious, but its gravity is greater when issuing from
some vital part, such as the lungs, stomach, kidneys,
cranium, etc.

In lung hæmorrhage the blood is coughed up, and
of a bright-red colour&mdash;fresh blood.

When coming from the stomach it is generally
intermingled with the vomited material.

If issuing from the urinary apparatus, it is either
mingled with the urine, so as to stain this fluid, or
passed as blood at the end of the act of urination.

In the latter case, it will most probably be coming
from the bladder, or the kidneys.

Hæmorrhage from the bowels is passed along with
the stools, or immediately following the act of
defecation, as frequently happens in piles.

Rupture of the heart, or the larger vessels gives
rise to a rapid and fatal hæmorrhage.

[407]

The treatment, with a view to arrest the bleeding,
will of course depend upon the conditions through
which it has been brought about.

If from without, e.g., a wound, the bleeding vessel
ought to be ligatured, or else have a compress
fastened on so as to exercise sufficient pressure
upon and above the injured vessel.

When bleeding is due to small blood-vessels having
been torn, tincture of steel, Friar's Balsam, etc., will
sometimes be sufficient to arrest it.

Cold water, or an ice compress is equally useful.
When blood comes from the lungs, e.g., a gunshot
wound in this region, there is generally a certain
amount of bronchial irritation, so that the dog must
be kept warm. Have ice compresses applied to the
chest, and 15 grains of gallic acid given three times
a day. If this fails, Adrenalin Tablets can be tried.

HÆMORRHOIDS (PILES)

The dog, like other animals, is liable to suffer from
piles, causing it considerable discomfiture. The
disease may be external, or internal. External piles
consist of enlarged veins, the result of a sluggish
circulation, and are more frequently seen in ladies'
lap-dogs, or those leading an indolent and useless
existence. Internal piles generally cause bleeding
and pain during defecation, and are often seen protruding
during the latter act.

[408]

Exercise, a liver laxative, such as 1 to 4 of Carter's
Little Liver Pills now and then, with the application
of a little gallic acid ointment, constitutes the safest
treatment that the amateur can adopt.

DYSPEPSIA (INDIGESTION)

Although the dog has remarkable powers of
digesting such apparently insoluble substances as
bones, etc., he, like most other animals, is a frequent
sufferer from digestive disturbance, though this
derangement of the digestive organs is certainly
of more frequent occurrence amongst dogs leading
inactive lives.

Probably the most frequent cause of dyspeptic
symptoms are the various forms of worms, so prevalent
amongst dogs.

Following this as a cause, decayed teeth are liable
to provoke it, whilst prolonged feeding on unsuitable
food, over, under, and irregular feeding, are equally
fruitful sources of mischief to the digestive
apparatus.

General unthriftiness, want of energy, and a morbid
appetite, together with foul breath, are the leading
features of disordered digestion.

It must be borne in mind, however, that the digestive
organs are frequently in a perverted condition
through disease in other parts, such as the heart,[409]
kidneys, liver, etc., and can only be regulated for
proper assimilation when treatment is directed
towards the mischief, in connection with any of the
foregoing organs.

Most suitable food is that containing a due proportion
of flesh and carbohydrate; therefore a mixture of
boiled paunch and boiled rice will meet this end.

Feed the dog regularly, and give no more than the
dictates of common sense suggest as sufficient for the
size of the dog. Give extract of malt daily.

Hounds and other sporting dogs should not be
allowed to eat as much as they like, no matter
however hard they may have been working.

If sickness is a troublesome symptom, it will generally
be advisable to give the dog a dose of worm
medicine. Should the results be negative, give one
of the following powders night and morning.



 
  &#8478;
  Bismuth carbonate
  1 drachm
 

 
  &nbsp;
  Pepsin
  20 grains
 

 
  Powdered charcoal
  2 drachms
 

 
  Powdered sugar
  1 drachm
 



Mix and divide into one dozen powders, giving in
their dry state, by placing on the back of the tongue.

Any loose or carious teeth ought to be removed,
and a dose of compound liquorice powder given occasionally
to regulate the bowels.

From a quarter to one teaspoonful of this powder
will be a suitable dose.

[410]

Should there be no improvement in the animal's
condition, it will be advisable to obtain skilled advice&mdash;not
such as is frequently offered by unqualified
canine specialists, or others of this class professing a
knowledge of "all pertaining to the doggy world."

JAUNDICE

Affections of the liver, or when the secretion or
excretion of bile is perverted, the symptom known
as jaundice results.

Very few people are unacquainted with the
characteristic yellow colouration of the skin and
visible mucous membranes.

The word "jaundice" comes from the French
"jaune," yellow, and "icterus," a Greek word for
golden thrush.

The yellow colour of the skin, white of eyes,
mucuous membranes lining eyelids and cheeks is, of
course diagnostic that the colouring matter of the
bile is circulating throughout the system.

The urine is usually deep yellow and very scanty,
and the motions often clay-coloured and hard, though
this latter condition is frequently absent, in fact
diarrhœa present.

This is particularly well marked in the so-called
hepatic or bilious form of distemper.

[411]

Gall-stones, when impacted in the bile-ducts, give
rise to jaundice and colic pains.

There is also a catarrhal condition of the bile-ducts
that leads to the same jaundiced condition.

As a considerable number of dogs succumb to
this affection, very careful treatment is necessary.
Linseed and mustard poultices over the region of the
liver, and a hot bath, will often work miracles. Soda-water
and milk should constitute the only nourishment
for a few days, unless it be teaspoonful doses of
Brand's Essence of Beef.

A grain of calomel along with a quarter teaspoonful
of sugar, night and morning for two or three days
(until the bowels are open), will be found to do
good in most instances. Further treatment can, with
advantage, be left to the veterinarian, so much
depending upon individual conditions.

RUPTURES

Although purely of a surgical nature, it may not
be out of place to mention that any organ or tissue
in any part of the body may be the seat of a rupture.

Ruptures of the stomach (rare in the dog), bladder,
liver, blood-vessels, bowels, muscles, etc., are of
occasional occurrence.

A very common rupture is that known as
"umbilical," many puppies showing this swelling[412]
in the region of the navel. Frequently it disappears
with increasing age. It is of little importance.

Rupture of the wall of the belly and protrusion of
the bowels, etc., is a serious condition, demanding
immediate professional aid.

This is equally applicable when the generative
organs or perinæum are injured.

Another form of rupture is that known as
"inguinal," denoted by a variously-sized swelling in
the region of the groin.

In scrotal rupture the testicular sac is enlarged.





[413]



CHAPTER XXI

Poisons and their Remedies

Poisoning by Arsenic&mdash;By Antimony&mdash;Strychnine&mdash;Phosphorus&mdash;Rat
and Other Vermin-Killers&mdash;By
Lead&mdash;Mercury&mdash;Ptomaine
Poisoning

POISONING BY ARSENIC

Very small quantities of this drug are capable of
bringing on a fatal inflammation of the stomach and
bowels, and it is only prescribed in the most minute
doses.

Fowler's Solution of Arsenic is the compound
generally selected for administration of the drug in
the liquid form, the average dose of it for the larger
sporting dogs being 10 drops. Arsenious acid or
white arsenic is an extremely cheap compound, and
one that enters largely into the composition of many
sheep-dips, a fact that it may be worth while to bear
in mind should a dog be poisoned in a manner,
suspiciously regarded.

This same poison is not uncommonly used for the
destruction of rats and other vermin, though the[414]
facilities for obtaining it are, to a great extent, a
barrier against its frequent employment for such
purposes.

Arsenic is a corrosive and irritant poison, producing
vomiting, dysentery, acute pain within the belly,
thirst, prostration, and a speedy but painful death.

As a rule, dogs poisoned by arsenic die, only the
mildest forms making recovery.

Under any circumstances it is advisable to seek the
assistance of a M.R.C.V.S., acting in accordance
with his instructions.

In the absence of professional aid, provided the
animal is not too much exhausted, an emetic should
be given, and for this purpose there is nothing more
suitable than 20 grains of white vitriol (sulphate of
zinc), or the same quantity of blue vitriol (sulphate of
copper), mixed with a couple of tablespoonfuls of
tepid water. If neither of these agents are handy,
use mustard, salt, and water.

Teaspoonful doses of brandy, mixed with the
same quantity of olive or salad oil, can be given at
frequent intervals.

Twenty-drop doses of chlorodyne, may be added if
the pain is severe.

Hot fomentations to the belly will do good.

ANTIMONY

The compound of this element most commonly
in use for medicinal purposes is that known as tartar[415]
emetic&mdash;an exceedingly active poison. Minute doses
are sometimes prescribed in order to induce vomiting,
and in bronchial complaints to produce expectoration.

The symptoms and treatment are practically on a
par with those laid down for arsenic. Vomiting and
extreme depression of the vital powers are specially
significant symptoms.

Both arsenic and antimony have their special
antidotes, though even these are of very doubtful
efficacy.

STRYCHNINE

Although a difficult poison to procure from any
source, it is surprising the number of dogs that are
annually poisoned by this agent.

In appearance, strychnine is a harmless-looking
crystalline (or powdered) white solid, the most minute
particles readily inducing muscular spasms and death.

Strychnine also occurs in the form of a buff-coloured
powder, known as nux vomica, the alkaloid
or active principle being strychnine.

Many gamekeepers make use of strychnine for
destroying such birds as hooded crows, etc.

Farmers now and then soak maize in a solution of
strychnine, in order to destroy crows in a wholesale
manner.

We merely mention these facts, as showing the
various sources from which a dog might accidentally
get poisoned.

[416]

In a very few minutes after swallowing strychnine
the dog becomes convulsed all over. The muscular
spasms may completely render the dog paralytic; in
fact, this usually happens. Quick and laboured
breathing is soon followed by complete collapse.

So rapidly does strychnine&mdash;especially if the dog
has taken a few grains&mdash;produce death, that there is
seldom much chance for the employment of remedial
agents, or to call professional assistance.

If there seems reasonable hopes of recovery, call in
a qualified veterinary surgeon at once. Twenty grains
of chloral hydrate, 25 grains each of potassium, iodide
and bromide, in water, can be used in the meantime.

PHOSPHORUS

It is hardly necessary to go beyond mentioning the
possibility of poisoning by this agent.

It is a constituent of so-called "phosphor paste"
largely used for the destruction of vermin, such as
rats and mice.

Dogs have been known to partake of it, usually
ending in death.

A most important matter is to avoid giving the
dog any oily substances, if poisoned by this element.

RAT AND OTHER VERMIN KILLERS

We have already spoken of phosphorus being the
active agent in some of these compounds. Barium[417]
and arsenic are likewise employed. Most of these
being proprietary articles, their exact composition
is not of any particular interest.

Sickness, thirst, severe pain and prostration, are
chief amongst the symptoms produced by such agents.

Empty stomach with an emetic; give small doses
of brandy in water, along with 40 grains of
carbonate of bismuth, every three hours, or oftener.

Keep dog quiet, and apply hot dry flannels to the
belly continuously.

LEAD

The most likely method for lead-poisoning to
occur in a dog is through the animal licking paint,
or drinking out of a leaden vessel.

It is an uncommon form of poisoning in the dog.
Lead poisoning can be either "acute" or "chronic,"
and is denoted by colicky pains, constipation and a
blue line around the gums. Paralysis and other
nervo-muscular signs supervene.

Give half an ounce of Epsom's salts until bowels
are freely open, and later on, 5 grains of iodide of
potash night and morning.

Warm fomentations to belly.

MERCURY

Mercurial poisoning but seldom occurs, and when
it does, it is chiefly the result of the continued
medicinal use of the drug, or as an over-dose.

[418]

Dogs seem particularly susceptible to the action of
mercurial compounds, so that this drug requires to be
given with circumspection.

An excessive discharge of saliva from the mouth
and loosening of the teeth are amongst the most
prominent signs.

PTOMAINE POISONING

To this class belongs various organic poisons produced
in food substances (fish, etc.), as the result of
fermentative changes, arising through the presence
of bacteria or other minute living organisms.

Although cases of ptomaine poisoning are more
frequently met with in the human subject, there is a
possibility of the occurrence of such in the dog.

Empty stomach with an emetic, say 20 grains of
white vitriol and given in two tablespoonfuls of tepid
water.



[419]

CHAPTER XXII

Diseases of the Urinary Organs

Disease of the Kidneys&mdash;Stone in the Bladder&mdash;Inflammation
of the Bladder&mdash;Stricture of
the Urethra

DISEASE OF THE KIDNEYS

One or both of the kidneys may be the seat of
acute or of chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation
of the kidneys is not uncommonly the result
of stone, or gravel, accumulating within what is
called the "pelvis" of the kidney.

Under these circumstances, the dog suffers great
discomfiture in passing his water, the latter being
ejected in very small quantities, and it is generally
stained with blood.

In some instances a single stone will occupy the
whole of the pelvis of the kidney, destroying its
functions, whereas in other cases the particles of stone
are small, or even gritty, rendering them extremely
liable to wander into other portions of the urinary
tract.

Abscess of the kidney is induced by the presence
of injecting material gaining admission.

[420]

Severe pain during urination, bloody-coloured
urine passed in drops, loss of condition and tenderness
across the loins, are some of the more prominent
signs of this malady. If there is the least suspicion
as to the presence of this complaint, consult a
M.R.C.V.S.

In the meantime, if the animal is in pain, give 30
drops of laudanum, in a little water, or, as a substitute,
20 drops of chlorodyne. Avoid giving the dog much
liquid, but easily-digested solid food, such as rice,
boiled chicken, etc.

STONE IN THE BLADDER

The dog is not uncommonly a sufferer from stone
in the bladder, the writer having seen the whole
cavity practically obliterated by the presence of one
or more calculi.

Considerable numbers have been removed by
operation.

When there are a number of calculi in the bladder,
the rubbing of one against another causes the faces
of them to become very smooth.

Calculi vary in size, hardness, weight, shape, and
position; likewise are more frequent in dogs than
bitches.

The chief indications of stone in the bladder are
the passage of small quantities of urine at very frequent
intervals, often bloodstained.

[421]

For the relief of this condition, surgical aid is
necessary.

INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER

This arises through chemical, mechanical, and
specific causes.

To the first class belong certain drugs; to the
second, stone; whilst the third class includes the germs
of distemper, blood-poisoning, etc., and the extension
of inflammation from adjacent parts.

It may also occur as the sequel to an operation for
stone in this organ.

The urine is passed in drops, and the dog is in considerable
pain, more so when the parts in this region
are pressed. It is generally fatal.

STRICTURE

The urethra is a tube leading from the bladder to
the exterior, serving for the passage of the urine.

Sometimes it is the seat of obstruction or stricture,
i.e., a narrowing of it.

Congestion, spasmodic contraction, and organic
changes are the principal causes.

The chief sign is the passage of urine in drops,
together with pain.

Give a hot bath, 20-drop doses of chlorodyne in a
little water, and consult a qualified veterinary
surgeon.





[422]



CHAPTER XXIII

Diseases of the Ear

Dropsy of the Ear-flap&mdash;Otitis or Inflammation
of the Ear&mdash;Otorrhœa or Canker&mdash;Split
Margin&mdash;Eczema of Ears&mdash;Deafness&mdash;Morbid
Growths in Passage&mdash;Concretions&mdash;Syringing
Ears.

DROPSY OF THE EAR-FLAP

Long-eared dogs&mdash;more especially Spaniels and
Retrievers&mdash;are very liable to suffer from this complaint.
In some instances the causes are, probably,
of a constitutional nature, but as a rule it is the
result of a bruise.

The bruise gives rise to the production of an inflammatory
effusion between the skin and cartilage of the
external ear, causing a baggy-like swelling, compressible
with the finger, and alterable in shape when
the external ear is manipulated.

The old, and by far the most satisfactory way of
dealing with this serous (watery) abscess is to make
a free cut into it. Introduce the finger into the
wound and break down adhesions; then wash out[423]
with a little iodine and water. Keep wound open
for a few days. This will always effect a cure.

OTITIS OR INFLAMMATION OF EAR

The passage of the ear is reddened and causes the
dog to rub his sore ear, or even cry from the pain.
Very frequently this condition is accompanied by a
fetid discharge; if so, it is spoken of as internal
canker of ear. A little cooling lotion, such as a couple
of teaspoonfuls of Goulard, in eight ounces of water,
applied night and morning, will usually suffice to cure
this complaint. At same time give a dose of purgative
medicine.

OTORRHŒA OR CANKER OF EAR

This is an exceedingly common disease of dogs,
and when it has been allowed to run on unchecked
becomes very intractable.

When the internal ear is in a diseased condition,
i.e., disease of the bones, etc., the malady is incurable.

In the majority of instances the middle ear alone
is the seat of inflammatory action and suppuration,
and usually curable.

One form of ear canker is produced by parasites
(Symbiotes auricularis canis) invading the passage.

The ordinary form of canker is the result of some
slight abrasion of the middle ear, and subsequent
infection of the wound by germs.

[424]

The secretion of the ear and constitutional predisposition
towards eczema have no doubt an influence
in determining the onset of canker, of a non-parasitic
nature.

The entrance of water and other foreign materials
is thought to be equally productive of this disease, but,
as already stated, in all probability it is necessary to
have some slight excoriation of the lining membrane.

Turning the head to one side&mdash;when one ear is
affected, though frequently both are diseased&mdash;pain
when the ear is manipulated, revealing, on close inspection
of the passage, increased redness, with a
sooty-like deposit (dry form), or moisture (moist
form), passing into various stages of suppuration,
are the usual signs of this disease.

Frequently the pus is mingled with blood, the latter
either coming from the tender abraded lining of the
middle ear, or, may be, from disease of the bones.

Careful inspection will generally settle the matter.
The duration of the malady is of importance when
forming an opinion.

In bad cases the discharge drops from the ears,
emitting a most offensive odour.

Treatment.&mdash;Cleanse ears thoroughly with warm
water and a little spirit of wine.

Syringe out daily.

Pour in some of the following lotion night and
morning.

[425]



 
  &#8478;
  Glycerine
  2 ounces
 

 
  &nbsp;
  Laudanum
  ½ ounce
 

 
  Lead acetate
  ½ drachm
 

 
  Water added
  8 ounces
 



Mix. Warm before use.

Milder cases can be cured by dusting boracic
acid powder into ear night and morning, and for
parasitic canker, use in the same way a little white
precipitate (ammoniated chloride of mercury).

Give a dose of purgative medicine, such as Epsom
salts, and then follow up with a course of alterative
medicine. (See Recipes).

SPLIT MARGIN

Injuries of the flap of the ear are often very
troublesome to treat successfully. On this account
such sores are spoken of as external canker, in
contradistinction to the disease previously discussed.

When the ear has been torn, it is necessary to have
professional aid to make a satisfactory job of it.

An effort must be made to get the edges of the torn
surfaces to heal by what is called first intention.

ECZEMA OF THE EARS

The margins of the flaps of the ears are commonly
the seat of a dry eczematous eruption. They become
scaly, thickened, and hairless.

Many dogs have their ears in this condition for[426]
years; nevertheless, it is very unsightly, and the
longer it exists the more the trouble of eradicating it.

Apply with friction an ointment, composed as
follows, night and morning.



 
  &#8478;
  Oil of tar
  2 drachms
 

 
  &nbsp;
  Glycerine
  2 drachms
 

 
  Powdered sulphur
  ½ ounce
 

 
  Creosote
  1 drachm
 

 
  Lard added
  4 ounces
 



Mix and rub well in all around the margins, for
twenty minutes each time.

In addition to this, give a 5-grain blue pill, feed on
meat and bread, giving less dog-biscuit, if this has
been the principal food. A course of alterative
medicine will be required.

DEAFNESS

Deafness may be "complete" or only "partial," and
confined to one, or affecting both ears.

In some dogs it is congenital, i.e., present from
birth; in others acquired.

Severe canker will cause deafness, so will a blow
over the ear.

Morbid growths in the passage, and accumulation
of waxy material, etc., will likewise produce "partial"
or "complete" loss of hearing.

Treatment must be directed to the removal&mdash;whenever
possible&mdash;of the cause.

[427]

MORBID GROWTHS IN THE EAR-PASSAGE

Occasionally the middle ear is the seat of various
morbid growths, either of a wart-like character, or as
small-stalked tumours, causing complete or partial
deafness, in accordance with the occluding area
involved.

Surgical treatment is necessary, excepting in the
case of a single-stalked growth (polypus), around
which a thin piece of twine or wire can be fixed. It
will then slough off.

Concretions.&mdash;These are chiefly accumulations of
wax within the ear, and should be removed first by
softening with a little warm almond oil and then
syringing with weak spirit and tepid water.

Syringing Ears.&mdash;Special glass, vulcanite and
rubber syringes are sold for this purpose. Before
injecting the fluid, warm it.

The stream of liquid should be forced well into the
ear.

For cleansing the ears, add a dessertspoonful of
spirit of wine to a teacupful of rose-water, warmed
before use.

This liquid can be syringed into the depths of the
passage once a day.

The dog should have a tape muzzle put on, and
then held by an assistant.





[428]



CHAPTER XXIV

Diseases of the Eye

Ophthalmia&mdash;Blindness&mdash;Inverted Eyelids&mdash;Everted
Eyelids&mdash;Torn Eyelids&mdash;Bareness
around Margins

OPHTHALMIA

Inflammation of one or both eyes is of fairly
frequent occurrence amongst dogs, more especially
when a dog has distemper; in fact, the eyes nearly
always participate in this malady. Injuries, such
as those produced by passing through thickets, etc.,
are also causes of this condition: likewise chemical,
and other mechanical agencies.

The conjunctiva, or membrane lining the eyelids
becomes an intense red: the eyes are intolerant to
light, and tears flow freely over the face: the eyelids
adherent, more especially after sleep, with a purulent
discharge issuing therefrom.

Prolonged inflammation is liable to end in the
production of opacity of the cornea, the surface of
this membrane becoming a bluish white.

[429]

In distemper, ulceration of it is not uncommon.
When Hounds are kept in damp kennels, where the
sanitary arrangements are bad, very severe forms of
distemper ophthalmia are frequent. The remark
applies also to other dogs so situated.

Treatment.&mdash;This must be of both a "local" and
general kind.

Sponge eyes several times daily with a weak
boracic acid lotion (30 grains to 6 ounces of
water), using a sponge or piece of linen previously
dipped in boiling water. Good results sometimes
follow fomenting with luke-warm tea, its simplicity
being a recommendation. When the cornea is
ulcerated, use a solution of nitrate of silver (4 grains
to the ounce of distilled water) as drops, night and
morning. Keep the dog's head steady, part the lids,
and then apply.

These drops will be equally useful for "cloudy
cornea."

Rest the eyes by keeping dog in a dark place.
Around the margins a little of Singleton's Golden
Eye Ointment will be of as much service as aught
else that can be recommended, and can be procured at
any drug stores.

BLINDNESS

A predisposing factor in the production of blindness
is that of old age, many aged dogs having what[430]
is known as senile cataracts. Injuries of any kind
to the eye are liable to end in either partial, or
complete, blindness.

In cataract, it is the lens, its covering, or both, that
are the seats of disease.

In the so-called glass eye (Amaurosis), the appearance
of the eye is that of a normal one, the optic
nerve being in a paralytic state.

Opacity of the cornea does, in accordance with the
degree and situation of such deposit, produce
corresponding deficiency of sight.

INVERTED EYELIDS

In this diseased condition it is generally the upper
eyelid that is turned inwards. If the eyelashes grow
inwards, it is called Trichiasis. In both conditions
it follows that the lashes must be in contact with the
globe of the eye.

If only a few lashes are growing inwards, they
should be pulled out, but, if numerous, this is not a
good plan. To cure it, a surgical operation is
necessary.

EVERTED EYELIDS

Like inverted or turned-in eyelid, everted, or
turned-out eyelid is not a diseased condition, but the
outcome of disease, probably of a weak orbicular
muscle.

[431]

It is the lower eye that is usually affected, and is
curable by operation only.

TORN EYELIDS

Injuries to the eyelids, unless properly treated,
are liable to result in permanent unsightliness, or,
it may be, affect the sight.

Either of the conditions last alluded to can be
produced through injury to the eyelids externally, or
internally.

Unless very slightly torn, it will be better to
consult a M.R.C.V.S.

FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EYES

Minute particles of foreign substances, such as
thorns, the outer covering of various seeds, etc., are
liable to gain admission into the eyes.

If the glume of an oat seed, etc., lodges on the
cornea, it may remain adherent, setting up inflammation
of it. Blindness is a common result.

When the cornea is punctured, it is advisable to
have professional advice.

After the removal of a foreign body&mdash;best done by
turning the upper lid outwards and upwards with
the fingers&mdash;insert a drop or two of castor oil daily
for a few days, or as long as seems necessary. Severe
injuries to the eyeball are liable to be followed by
sympathetic inflammation in the sound eye.

[432]

BARENESS ROUND MARGINS OF EYES

It commonly happens that around the margins,
through several causes, the hairy part becomes
destitute of hair, giving the dog a very unsightly
appearance.

In most instances the disease is of an eczematous
nature, requiring constitutional treatment for its
removal. (See Eczema.)

As an erythema it is seen in distemper, arising
through the acrid discharge from the eyes scalding
the surrounding areas.

Smear the part with a little Singleton's Golden
Eye Ointment, or with a little vaseline, cold cream,
or boracic acid ointment.





[433]



CHAPTER XXV

Injuries and Minor Operations

Wounds&mdash;Overgrown Claws&mdash;Fractures

WOUNDS

Lacerated and punctured wounds are very common,
more especially amongst sporting dogs, and this
chiefly owing to the thickets, etc., they have to face
during work.

Wounds and fractures are not uncommonly
associated; if so, the injury is spoken of as compound.
The gravity of a dual injury is much greater than
where either exists as a single one.

Gunshot wounds are not uncommon, and when
examining such, a good deal of care is necessary.
Sometimes the shots are simply lodged beneath the
skin, and can be felt by rolling the skin beneath the
fingers.

In other instances the flesh is penetrated, and, it
may be, the internal organs injured.

Although shot may have penetrated the cavity of
the chest, or the belly, it does not follow that the
injury be of a vital nature; in fact, the author's[434]
experience of gunshot wounds in the dog has been as
a rule favourable, most of the dogs showing but little
after effects.

If shot have passed deeply in, penetrating the chest,
etc., no attempt should be made to interfere with the
wounds.

When shots are lodged in tendons, etc., about the
knee, they should be removed forthwith.

Lacerated or torn wounds will probably require
sewing up; if so, they must first of all be thoroughly
cleansed with some warm water, to which a little disinfectant
has been added.

Special care must be taken to remove all irritating
particles, and the hair ought to be clipped closely
off in juxtaposition to the injury.

Severe bleeding must be arrested with cold water,
or by touching the end of the bleeding vessel with
the point of a hot iron, or through the application
of a few drops of strong tincture of iron, tow, and
a bandage.

A stout needle and boiled string can be used to
sew up the wound.

A very common situation to find a clean-cut
(incised) wound is upon the pads of the feet, caused
by the dog stepping upon some sharp object, such as a
bit of glass, flint, etc.

Put the foot in hot water and cover it with a pad
of tow or lint, soaked in a little carbolic oil or other[435]
antiseptic liniment, bandage, and keep dog at rest for
a few days.

A little compound tincture of myrrh is an excellent
remedy for painting superficial wounds, so is boracic
acid as a dusting powder.

Every kennelman should keep these handy in case
of emergency, likewise tow, a bandage, and some
antiseptic, such as carbolic acid, chinosol, etc.

OVERGROWN CLAWS

It is very common to find the length of the claws
so excessive that the resulting overgrowth penetrates
the soft structures, causing the part to suppurate, and
the dog lameness.

Clip off the offending part with a sharp pair of
nippers. As a rule, nothing further is required.

FRACTURES

The long bones, i.e., the bones of the limbs, are
those commonly broken, but short, flat and irregular
bones are frequently injured.

Broken back may happen when a dog is run over,
but this is more liable to happen to a non-sporting
dog, or rather to such as are kept in the neighbourhood
of busy thoroughfares.

A senseless puppy sometimes meets with an
accident of this class.

[436]

A dislocation is an injury whereby the bone is
forced out of its place.

The short bones of the feet are often broken, and
their repair is usually an easy one, though, as in the
case of the other fractures, complicated, if a wound
be present.

Fractures of the skull are not common injuries
amongst dogs, and when they do occur, call for special
skill in treatment.

If the broken ends of a bone are not accurately
adjusted, a deformed, or false, union results, more or
less spoiling the utility of the animal.

As a rule, considerable swelling comes on after
fracture of the long bones, especially of the forearm,
therefore an effort must be made to subdue this by
bathing freely with warm water.

Well-padded splints should be used&mdash;if applicable&mdash;and
applied directly to the skin, being retained in
position by a bandage.

If the bandage is too tightly applied, the circulation
to the part will be interfered with, probably destroying
the vitality of it. Coldness and numbness are the
chief signs of this.

Leather, wood, gutta-percha, starch, egg and
gum, etc., are all used as supports to a broken
limb. A plaster bandage is very useful.

In the case of a valuable dog, it is advisable to consult
a qualified veterinary practitioner.

[437]

Rest is of course an indispensable factor in the
treatment of both fractures and dislocations.

When a dislocation accompanies a fracture, or
wound and fracture, at a joint, the animal should
be destroyed, as the results of surgery under these
conditions is not often satisfactory.





[438]



CHAPTER XXVI

Minor Operations

Docking&mdash;Setoning&mdash;Enemas&mdash;Fomentations&mdash;Blistering&mdash;Tumours
and Warts

DOCKING

Such varieties as Fox, Airedale, Irish Terriers,
Spaniels, etc., require to have their tails shortened,
and this should be done when the puppies are, say,
a couple or three weeks old. An old, but rather
revolting custom is that of biting off the requisite
portion.

A sharp pair of serrated scissors, or a chisel, will
do the work satisfactorily, and nothing should be
done to the cut end, beyond allowing the healing to
follow its natural course.

SETONING

Setons and rowels are not used in the present day
so much as in times gone by, nevertheless, when
employed with discretion, are of service.

At one time setons were largely used for insertion
into the poll when a dog had fits, especially during
distemper. In the author's opinion they are injurious
for this purpose, but as a counter-irritant in lung and[439]
bronchial complaints, good often results from their
employment. Many local swellings can be dispersed
through the insertion of either a set-on   or a rowel.
Tape, horse-hair, tow, or a circular piece of leather
wrapped in tow, are the issues used. If a seton, the
skin must be snipped at the inlet and outlet; the
needle threaded and passed along under the skin (no
deeper as a rule) to the point of exit, and the tape
fastened off. It is usual to smear the tape with some
stimulating substance, such as resin or turpentine
ointment, in order to excite a speedy local inflammation.
The tape must be moved (not removed) daily,
kept clean, and smeared with the ointment twice
weekly.

CLYSTERS OR ENEMAS (LAVEMENTS)

These may be either plain, medicated, or nutritive.
For the two first-named purposes, either warm or
cold water may be used, the amount varying with
the effect it is desired to produce.

To empty the lower end of the bowel, from half
to three pints will be found sufficient for most
sporting dogs.

A little salt, soft soap, and glycerine, will increase
the activity of the clyster.

A chronic, torpid condition of the lower end of the
bowel is best overcome by injecting about half a
teacupful of cold water into it every morning, at the[440]
same time allowing plenty of exercise and a soft diet,
such as oatmeal, or wet bread and meat.

In diarrhœa, dysentery, etc., good results are often
obtained by giving a cold boiled-starch clyster.
About four tablespoonfuls will be enough at a time.
When it is desirable to administer nourishment by
the rectum, it is necessary to wash out the lower end
of the bowel with a warm-water clyster, before injecting
the nutritive medium.

The yolk of an egg, a dessertspoonful of brandy,
and a teaspoonful of sulphuric ether makes a useful,
sustaining enema.

Another good injection is a couple of teaspoonfuls
of salt, dissolved in half a pint of tepid water, then
injected.

Loss of blood, etc., can often be made up by the use
of this saline injection.

FOMENTATIONS

For many purposes fomentations are superior to
poultices, the chief difficulty being in keeping up the
heat to the desirable standard.

A pad of thick flannel should be planned, and this
soaked in boiling water, then wrung dry in a roller.

To assist in maintaining the heat, a piece of mackintosh
sheeting ought to be put over the pad, and a
dry flannel above all.

[441]

For difficult breathing, pain in the belly, or local
pain, etc., moist warmth is exceedingly beneficial, and
quite harmless under any circumstances.

In animals, it is a general custom to bathe the seat
of disease with the hot water.

Perseverance is essential to success, and more harm
results from hot fomentations applied in a half-hearted
manner than where they are not used at all.

BLISTERING

Beyond the application of mustard, turpentine, or
hot water, blistering agents are not much employed
in the treatment of canine ailments.

As a remedy for external use in diseases of the
bronchial tubes and lungs, mustard has not, in the
author's opinion, any superior.

It can be used either as a paste applied directly
to the skin, or in combination with boiled linseed
poultices.

In long-haired dogs it is advisable to clip off some
of the hair, so as to facilitate the full counter-irritant
properties of the mustard.

It requires very little rubbing in, and it is not
advisable to repeat the application, unless specially
called for.

TUMOURS AND WARTS

A multiplicity of morbid growths are liable to[442]
occur in dogs, some of these growths being of a
very simple nature, others of a malignant or recurrent
order.

By far the commonest are warty growths upon lips,
tongue, and generative organ.

It is remarkable, but these often disappear spontaneously.

Solitary warts, if sufficiently large, can be removed
by tying a piece of strong whip-cord around the root
of the growth. This remark is equally applicable to
other small tumours.

Dressing with some caustic agent such as lunar
caustic, strong acetic acid, blue-stone, etc., may be
effected in some cases, and others (when on tongue),
dusted with dry calcined magnesia.

Tumours about the belly, etc., demand professional
skill.

Polypi, or stalked tumours, are commonly found
growing from the mucous membrane of the ears,
nose, and female generative passage.

They can be removed by ligature.





[443]



APPENDIX

White West Highland Terrier

STANDARD OF POINTS AS AGREED UPON AT THE MEETING
OF THE CLUB REPORTED UNDER "CLUB NOTICES."

1. The General Appearance of the White West Highland
Terrier is that of a small, game, hardy-looking Terrier,
possessed with no small amount of self-esteem, with a
varminty appearance, strongly built, deep in chest and
back ribs, straight back and powerful quarters, on
muscular legs, and exhibiting in a marked degree a
great combination of strength and activity. The Coat
should be about 2-1/2 in. long, white in colour, hard,
with plenty of soft under coat, and no tendency to wave
or curl. The Tail should be as straight as possible, and
carried gaily, and covered with hard hair, but not bushy.
The Skull should not be too narrow, being in proportion
to the terribly powerful jaw, but must be narrow between
the ears. The Ears should be as small and sharp-pointed
as possible, and carried tightly up, but must be either erect
or semi-erect, and both ears must be exactly alike. The
Eyes of moderate size, dark hazel in colour, widely placed,
rather sunk or deep-set, with a sharp, bright, intelligent
expression. The Muzzle should be proportionately long and
powerful, gradually tapering towards the nose. The Nose,
Roof of Mouth, and Pads of Feet distinctly black in colour.

2. Colour.&mdash;White.

3. Coat.&mdash;Very important and seldom seen to perfection:[444]
must be double-coated. The outer coat consists of hard
hair, about 2-1/2 ins. long, and free from any curl. The
under coat, which resembles fur, is short, soft, and close.
Open coats are objectionable.

4. Size.&mdash;Dogs to weigh from 14 lbs. to 18 lbs., and
bitches from 12 lbs. to 16 lbs., and measure from 8 ins.
to 12 ins. at the shoulder.

5. Skull.&mdash;Should not be too narrow, being in proportion
to his powerful jaw, proportionally long, slightly domed,
and gradually tapering to the eyes, between which there
should be a slight indentation or stop. Eyebrows heavy.
The hair on the skull to be from ¾ in. to 1 in. long,
fairly hard.

6. Eyes.&mdash;Widely set apart, medium size, dark hazel in
colour, slightly sunk in the head, sharp and intelligent,
which, looking from under the heavy eyebrows, give a
piercing look. Full eyes and also light-coloured eyes are
very objectionable.

7. Muzzle.&mdash;Should be powerful. The jaws level and
powerful, and teeth square or evenly met, well set, and
large for the size of the dog.

8. Ears.&mdash;Small, carried erect or semi-erect, but never
drop, and should be carried tightly up. The semi-erect
ear should drop nicely over at the tips, the break being
about three-quarters up the ear, and both forms of ears
should terminate in a sharp point. The hair on them
should be short, smooth (velvety), and they should not be
cut. The ears should be free from any fringe at the top.
Round-pointed, broad, and large ears are objectionable,
also ears too heavily covered with hair.

9. Neck.&mdash;Muscular, and nicely set on sloping shoulders.

10. Chest.&mdash;Very deep, with breadth in comparison to the
size of the dog.

[445]

11. Body.&mdash;Compact, straight back, ribs deep and well
arched in the upper half of rib, presenting a flattish side
appearance. Loins broad and strong. Hind-quarters
strong, muscular, and wide across the top.

12. Legs and Feet.&mdash;Both fore-and hind-legs should be
short and muscular. The shoulder-blades should be comparatively
broad, and well sloped backwards. The points
of the shoulder-blades should be closely knit into the
backbone, so that very little movement of them should be
noticeable when the dog is walking. The elbow should be
close in to the body, both when moving or standing, thus
causing the fore-leg to be well placed in under the shoulder.
The fore-legs should be straight and thickly covered with
short, hard hair. The hind-legs should be short and
sinewy. The thighs very muscular, and not too wide apart.
The hocks bent and well set in under the body, so as to be
fairly close to each other, either when standing, walking,
or running (trotting), and, when standing, the hind-legs,
from the point of the hock down to the fetlock joint, should
be straight or perpendicular, and not far apart. The fore
feet are larger than the hind ones, are round, proportionate
in size, strong, thickly padded, and covered with short, hard
hair. The foot must point straight forward. The hind
feet are smaller, not quite as round as fore feet, and thickly
padded. The under surface of the pads of feet, and all the
nails, should be distinctly black in colour. Hocks too
much bent (cow hocks) detracts from the general appearance.
Straight hocks are weak: both kinds are undesirable,
and should be guarded against.

13. Tail.&mdash;6 ins. or 7 ins. long, covered with hard hair
(no feather), as straight as possible, carried gaily, but not
curled over back. A long tail is objectionable.

14. Movement.&mdash;Should be free, straight, and easy all[446]
round. In front, the leg should be freely extended
forward by the shoulder. The hind movement should be
free, strong, and close. The hocks should be freely flexed
and drawn close in under the body, so that, when moving off
the foot, the body is thrown or pushed forward with some
force. Stiff, stilty movement behind is very objectionable.

Faults.

1. Coat.&mdash;Any silkiness, wave, or tendency to curl is a
serious blemish, as is also an open coat.

2. Size.&mdash;Any specimens under the minimum weight, or
above the maximum weight, are objectionable.

3. Eyes.&mdash;Full or light-coloured.

4. Ears.&mdash;Round-pointed, drop, broad, and large ears,
also ears too heavily covered with hair.

5. Muzzle.&mdash;Either under, or overshot and defective teeth.

FOOTNOTES





[1] Liver-coloured flat and wavy coated specimens are not at all uncommon,
though not generally preferred.



[2] A moderate degree of development of the Membrana Nictitans
(so called Haw) is not only typical of the Clumber, but advantageous.
To remove this useful Membrane (unless for surgical
reasons) is a cruel and useless procedure, deserving severe condemnation.



[3] The heights of the Crickhowell Harriers are as follows:&mdash;Dogs,
17½ to 18½ inches; bitches, 17 to 18 inches.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at www.gutenberg.org. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that


You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.


1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
