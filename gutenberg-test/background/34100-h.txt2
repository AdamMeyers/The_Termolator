11LEFTY LOCKE, PITCHER-MANAGER

CHAPTER IAN UNEXPECTED OFFER

Lefty Locke gave the man a look of surprise.
The soft, bright moonlight was
shining full on Weegman&#8217;s face, and he
was chuckling. He was always chuckling or laughing
outright, and Locke had grown tired of it. It
was monotonous.

&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; the pitcher asked. &#8220;Tinware
for Kennedy! I don&#8217;t believe I get you.&#8221;

Weegman snapped his fingers; another little
trick that was becoming monotonous and irritating.
&#8220;That&#8217;s poor slang perhaps,&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;but
you&#8217;ve been in the game long enough to understand
it. Collier is going to tie the can to old Jack.&#8221;

Lefty moved his chair round on the little vine-covered
porch in order to face his visitor squarely.
Frogs were chorusing in the distance, and the dynamo
in the electric power house on the edge of the
town kept up its constant nocturnal droning.

12&#8220;I could scarcely believe you meant just that,&#8221;
said the star slabman of the Blue Stockings soberly.
&#8220;Being Charles Collier&#8217;s private secretary,
and therefore to a large extent aware of his
plans, I presume you know what you&#8217;re talking
about.&#8221;

&#8220;You can bet on it,&#8221; laughed Weegman, leaning
back and puffing at his cigar. &#8220;I&#8217;m the man Collier
left to carry out his orders regarding the team.
I have full instructions and authority.&#8221;

&#8220;But I&#8217;m sure Kennedy has no inkling of this.
I correspond with him regularly, and I know he
expected a new contract to sign before Mr. Collier
went abroad. He wrote me that the contract was
to be mailed him from New York, but that he supposed
Collier, being a sick man, forgot it at the
last moment.&#8221;

Weegman took the cigar from his mouth, and
leaned forward on the arm of his chair. &#8220;A new
manager of the right sort is hard to find,&#8221; he
stated confidentially, &#8220;and Collier wasn&#8217;t ready
to let go all holds until he had some one else in
view at least.&#8221;

Locke uttered a smothered exclamation of incredulity.
&#8220;Do you mean to tell me that Charles
Collier was handing old Jack Kennedy a deal as
deceitfully crooked as that?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
believe it. Kennedy has been a faithful and loyal
13
manager. Three years ago, when Collier secured
the controlling interest in the club, his bad judgment
led him to drop Kennedy and fill his place
with Al Carson. You know what happened. Carson
made a mess of it, and old Jack was called back
at the last moment to save the day. He did it and
won the championship for the Blue Stockings by a
single game. Since then&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Come now!&#8221; chuckled Weegman, snapping his
fingers again. &#8220;You know you were the man who
really won that championship by your air-tight
pitching. Why do you want to give somebody else
the credit? Kennedy merely went in as a pinch
hitter&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;And pounded the only run of the game across
the rubber. No matter how air-tight a pitcher&#8217;s
work may be, to win games the team behind him
has got to hit. Kennedy was there with the
goods.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s ancient history now. What has he done
since then? As a player, he&#8217;s a has-been. He&#8217;s
lost his eyes so that he can&#8217;t even bat in the pinches
now. His sun has set, and he may as well retire to
his farm and settle down for old age.&#8221;

&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t lost his brains,&#8221; asserted Locke
warmly. &#8220;Playing or pinch hitting is a small part
of a manager&#8217;s business. Once since then he&#8217;s
copped the bunting for us, and last year it was
14
hard luck and injury to players that dropped us
into third position.&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; said Weegman good naturedly.
&#8220;You ought to stand up for him. It
shows the right spirit. He gave you your chance&#8211;practically plucked you from the brambles.
But,&#8221; he supplemented disparagingly, &#8220;he was
desperately hard up for twirlers that season. You
were sort of a lucky guess on his part. Save for
the fact that he&#8217;s never been able to win a world&#8217;s
championship, old Jack&#8217;s been picking four-leaf
clovers all his life. He&#8217;s too soft and easy-going
for a manager; not enough drive to him.&#8221;

It was Lefty Locke&#8217;s turn to laugh, but his merriment
held more than a touch of irony. &#8220;Jack
Kennedy has won pennants or kept in the first division,
at least, with teams that would have been
fighting for the subcellar under any other manager.
When meddlers have not interfered he&#8217;s
always been able to get the last ounce of baseball
out of every man under him. While he has handled
it the club has always been a big paying proposition.
What he has done has been nothing short of
miraculous considering the niggardly policy forced
upon him by those in power. It&#8217;s the lowest-salaried
team in the league. We have men getting
twenty-five hundred or three thousand who should
be drawing down twice as much, and would be with
15
any other winning Big League club. Only a man
with Kennedy&#8217;s magnetism and tact could have
kept them going at high pressure, could have kept
them from being dissatisfied and lying down.
What they&#8217;ve accomplished has been done for him,
not for the owners. And now you tell me he&#8217;s to
be canned. There&#8217;s gratitude!&#8221;

&#8220;My dear man,&#8221; chirruped Weegman, &#8220;baseball
is business, and gratitude never goes far in business.
Granting what you say may have been true
in the past, it&#8217;s plain enough that the old man&#8217;s beginning
to lose his grip. He fell down last season,
and now that the Feds are butting in and making
trouble, he&#8217;s showing himself even more incompetent.
Talk about gratitude; it didn&#8217;t hold Grist
or Orth, and now it&#8217;s reported that Dillon is negotiating
with the outlaws. You know what that
means; our pitching staff is all shot to pieces. If
the players were so true to Kennedy, why didn&#8217;t
they wait for their contracts?&#8221;

&#8220;How could Jack send them contracts when he
hasn&#8217;t one himself? If he had the authority now,
perhaps he could save Dillon for us even yet.
Billy Orth is hot-headed and impulsive, and he
thought he wasn&#8217;t given a square deal. As for
Grist, old Pete&#8217;s days are numbered, and he knows
it. He was wise to the talk about asking waivers
on him. It was a ten-to-one shot he&#8217;d have been
16
sent to the minors this coming season. With the
Federals offering him a three-year contract at
nearly twice as much as he ever received, he&#8217;d have
been a fool to turn it down. All the same, he had
a talk with Kennedy before he signed. Jack
couldn&#8217;t guarantee him anything, so he jumped.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; exclaimed Weegman triumphantly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a sample of Kennedy&#8217;s incompetence
right there. He should have baited Grist along,
and kept him away from the Feds until the season
was well under way, when they would have had
their teams made up, and probably wouldn&#8217;t have
wanted Pete. Then, if he didn&#8217;t come up to form,
he could be let out to the minors.&#8221;

Lefty&#8217;s face being in the shadow, the other man
did not see the expression of contempt that passed
over it. For a few minutes the southpaw was
too indignant to reply. When he did, however,
his voice was level and calm, though a trifle
hard.

&#8220;So that would have been your way of doing it!
Grist has had hard luck with all his investments;
I understand he&#8217;s saved very little. He&#8217;s a poor
man.&#8221;

Weegman lolled back again, puffing at his cigar.
&#8220;That&#8217;s his lookout. Anyway, he&#8217;s not much loss.
But these confounded Feds aren&#8217;t through; they&#8217;re
after Dirk Nelson, too. What d&#8217;ye know about
17
that! Our best catcher! They seem to be trying
to strip our whole team.&#8221;

&#8220;Knowing something about the salaries our
players get, probably they figure it should be easy
stripping.&#8221;

Suddenly the visitor leaned forward again, and
gazed hard at Locke. He was not laughing now.
&#8220;Have they been after you?&#8221; he asked.

&#8220;Yes.&#8221;

&#8220;I thought likely. Made you a big offer?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes.&#8221;

&#8220;What have you done?&#8221;

&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;

&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Weegman. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good
thing for you that you kept your head. They&#8217;re
outside organized ball, and any man who jumps to
them will be blacklisted. All this talk about the
money they have behind them is pure bluff.&#8221;

&#8220;Think so?&#8221;

&#8220;I know it. They&#8217;re plunging like lunatics, and
they&#8217;ll blow up before the season&#8217;s over. They
haven&#8217;t got the coin.&#8221;

&#8220;Then how does it happen they are signing players
for three years, and handing over certified
checks in advance for the first year, besides guaranteeing
salaries by bank deposits for the full
tenure of contracts?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ve got some money, of course,&#8221; admitted
18
Weegman lightly; &#8220;but, as I say, they&#8217;re
spending it like drunken sailors. When the Feds
explode, the fools who have jumped to them will
find themselves barred from organized ball for all
time; they&#8217;ll be down and out. The outlaws may
hurt us a little this year, but after that&#8211;nothing
doing. Just the same, I own up we&#8217;ve got to put a
check on &#8217;em before they rip the Blue Stockings
wide open. That&#8217;s what brings me down here to
Fernandon to see you.&#8221;

&#8220;Really!&#8221; said Lefty interestedly. &#8220;You seem
to be shouldering a lot of responsibility.&#8221;

&#8220;I am,&#8221; chuckled Charles Collier&#8217;s private secretary.
&#8220;It was all arranged with Mr. Collier before
he sailed. He left me with proper authority.
I am to sign up the manager for the team.&#8221;

&#8220;Is that right?&#8221; exclaimed Locke, surprised.
&#8220;Then, according to your own statement, if you
want to save the Blue Stockings from being riddled,
you&#8217;d better be about it.&#8221;

&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Weegman. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve
come to you.&#8221;

&#8220;For advice?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; He laughed heartily. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
need that. I know what I&#8217;m about. I&#8217;ve brought
a contract. I want you to put your name to it.
Your salary will be advanced fifteen hundred dollars.&#8221;

19&#8220;The Feds offered to double it. As a
pitcher&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re not getting this extra money on account
of your pitching,&#8221; interposed Weegman promptly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m offering you the increase of salary to assume
the additional duties of manager.&#8221;


20CHAPTER IISOMETHING QUEER

The expression of amazement that leaped
into the eyes of Lefty Locke was masked
by a shadow. He stiffened, and sat bolt
upright, speechless.

Bailey Weegman, having stated the business
that had unexpectedly brought him down from the
North to the Florida town where the great left-hander
of the Blue Stockings was spending the
winter with his wife, once more settled back, taking
a long, satisfied pull at the stump of his fragrant
Havana. He was chuckling beneath his
breath. A gentle breeze crept into the leaves of
the vine-covered porch and set them whispering
like gossips. The dynamo droned drowsily in the
distance.

Presently Lefty found his voice. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
joke?&#8221; he asked a trifle harshly.

&#8220;No joke,&#8221; assured the jovial visitor. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
given to joking. I&#8217;m a man of business.&#8221;

&#8220;But it&#8217;s preposterous! A pitcher for manager!&#8221;

21&#8220;Clark Griffith isn&#8217;t the only pitcher who has
succeeded as a manager.&#8221;

&#8220;Griffith&#8217;s success came when he was on the decline
as a pitcher.&#8221;

&#8220;What&#8217;s the use to argue, Locke? There&#8217;s
really no good reason why a pitcher shouldn&#8217;t
manage a ball team. You&#8217;ve been doing it with
the little amateur club you&#8217;ve been running down
here in Fernandon this winter.&#8221;

&#8220;Because necessity compelled. Nobody else
would take hold of it. I organized the team for a
special reason. It&#8217;s made up mainly of visitors
from the North. No salaries are paid. I had
located here for the winter, and I wanted to keep
in trim and work my arm into shape for the coming
season. I couldn&#8217;t find anybody else to organize
the club and handle it, so I had to. I have
only three other players who have been with me
from the start. The rest of the nine has been composed
of changing players who came and went,
college men, or just plain amateurs who have taken
to the sport. We have played such teams as could
be induced to come here from Jacksonville, St.
Augustine, and other places. Handling such a
club has given me absolutely no reason to fancy
myself qualified to manage one in the Big League.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve been keeping my eye on you,&#8221; said Weegman
patronizingly, &#8220;and I am satisfied that you
22
can fill the position of playing manager for the
Blue Stockings.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re satisfied&#8211;you! How about Charles
Collier?&#8221;

&#8220;As you know, he&#8217;s a sick man, a very sick man.
Otherwise he&#8217;d never have dropped everything
just at this time to go to Europe along with a
physician and trained nurses. He has been too ill
to attend properly to his regular business outside
baseball, and therefore his business has suffered.
He has had heavy financial reverses that have worried
him. And now the meddling of the Feds has
hurt the value of the ball club. The stock wouldn&#8217;t
bring at a forced sale to-day half what it should be
worth. Mr. Collier trusts me. He was anxious to
get some of the load off his shoulders. He has left
me to straighten out matters connected with the
team.&#8221;

&#8220;Where is Mr. Collier now?&#8221; asked Locke
quietly.

&#8220;He was taking the baths at Eaux Chaudes when
last heard from, but he has since left there. I
can&#8217;t say where he is at the present time.&#8221;

&#8220;Then how may he be communicated with in case
of emergency?&#8221;

Chuckling, Weegman lighted a fresh cigar, having
tossed the remnant of the other away. The
23
glow of the match fully betrayed an expression of
self-satisfaction on his face.

&#8220;He can&#8217;t be,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was his doctor&#8217;s
idea to get him away where he could not be troubled
by business of any nature. He may be in Tunis
or Naples for all I know.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s very remarkable,&#8221; said Lefty slowly.

&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; purred the other man, locking
his fingers over his little round stomach which
seemed so incongruous for a person who was
otherwise not overfat. &#8220;Really, he was in a bad
way. Worrying over business reverses was killing
him. His only salvation was to get away from
it all.&#8221;

Locke sat in thought, watching the serene
smoker through narrowed lids. There was something
queer about the affair, something the southpaw
did not understand. True, Collier had
seemed to be a nervous, high-strung man, but when
Lefty had last seen him he had perceived no indications
of such a sudden and complete breakdown.
It had been Collier&#8217;s policy to keep a close and constant
watch upon his baseball property, but now,
at a time when such surveillance was particularly
needed because of the harassing activities of the
Federals, having turned authority over to a subordinate,
not only had he taken himself beyond the
24
range of easy communication, but apparently
he had cut himself off entirely from the sources of
inside information concerning baseball affairs.
Furthermore, it seemed to Locke that the man who
claimed to have been left in full control of that
branch of Collier&#8217;s business was the last person
who should have been chosen. What lay behind
it all the pitcher was curious to divine.

Presently Weegman gave a castanet-like snap
of his fingers. &#8220;By the way,&#8221; he said sharply,
&#8220;how about your arm?&#8221;

&#8220;My arm?&#8221; said Lefty. &#8220;You mean&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, isn&#8217;t it? You know there was a
rumor that you hurt it in the last game of the season.
Some wise ginks even said you&#8217;d never pitch
any more.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing some pitching for my team
here in Fernandon.&#8221;

&#8220;Then, of course, the old wing&#8217;s all right.
You&#8217;ll be in form again, the greatest left-hander
in the business. How about it?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been egotistical enough to put that
estimate on myself.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what lots of the sharps call you.
The arm&#8217;s as good as ever?&#8221;

&#8220;If you stop over to-morrow you&#8217;ll have a
chance to judge for yourself. We&#8217;re scheduled to
play a roving independent nine known as the Wind
25
Jammers, and I hear they&#8217;re some team, of the
kind. I shall pitch part of the game, anyhow.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;ve been pitching right along?&#8221;

&#8220;A little in every game lately. I pitched four
innings against the Jacksonville Reds and five
against the Cuban Giants. We&#8217;ve lost only one
game thus far, and that was our second one. The
eccentric manager and owner of the Wind Jammers,
who calls himself Cap&#8217;n Wiley, threatens to
take a heavy fall out of us. He has a deaf-mute
pitcher, Mysterious Jones, who, he claims, is as
good as Walter Johnson.&#8221;

Weegman laughed derisively. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
pitcher as good as Johnson anywhere, much less
traveling around with a bunch of hippodromers
and bushwhackers. But about your arm&#8211;is it all
right?&#8221;

&#8220;I hope to win as many games with it this year
as I did last.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, the team&#8217;s going to need pitchers. The
loss of Orth is bound to be felt, and if Dillon
jumps&#8211;Look here, Locke, we&#8217;ve got to get busy
and dig up two or three twirlers, one of top-notch
caliber.&#8221;

&#8220;We!&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, you and I. Of course we can&#8217;t expect to
get a first-stringer out of the bushes; that happens
only once in a dog&#8217;s age. But perhaps Kennedy
26
has some good youngsters up his sleeve. You
should know about that. I&#8217;m wise that he has consulted
you regularly. He&#8217;s sought your advice,
and listened to it; so, in a way, you&#8217;ve had considerable
to do with the management of the team.
You say you&#8217;ve corresponded with him right along.
You ought to know all about his plans. That&#8217;s one
reason why I came to figure on you as the man to
fill his place.&#8221;

&#8220;I wondered,&#8221; murmured Locke.

&#8220;That&#8217;s one reason. For another thing, you&#8217;ve
got modesty as well as sense. You don&#8217;t think
you know it all. You&#8217;re not set in your ways, and
probably you&#8217;d listen to advice and counsel. Old
Jack is hard-headed and stiff; when he makes up
his mind there&#8217;s no turning him. He takes the bit
in his teeth, and he wants full swing. He&#8217;s always
seemed to feel himself bigger than the owners.
He&#8217;s butted up against Mr. Collier several times,
and Collier&#8217;s always had to give in.&#8221;

&#8220;As I understand it,&#8221; said Lefty smoothly,
&#8220;you think the manager should be a man with few
fixed opinions and no set and rigid policy.&#8221;

&#8220;In a way, that&#8217;s something like it,&#8221; admitted
Weegman. &#8220;He mustn&#8217;t go and do things wholly
on his own initiative and without consulting anybody,
especially those who have a right to say
something about the running of the team. Mr.
27
Collier has placed me in a position that makes it
imperative that I should keep my fingers on the
pulse of things. I couldn&#8217;t conscientiously discharge
my duty unless I did so. I know I could
never get along with Kennedy. The manager
must work with me; we&#8217;ll work together. Of
course, in most respects he&#8217;ll be permitted to do
about as he pleases as long as he seems to be delivering
the goods; but it must be understood that
I have the right to veto, as well as the right to
direct, policies and deals. With that understanding
to start with, we&#8217;ll get along swimmingly.&#8221;
He finished with a laugh.

Lefty rose to his feet. &#8220;You&#8217;re not looking for
a manager, Weegman,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What you
want is a putty man, a figurehead. Under any
circumstances, you&#8217;ve come to the wrong market.&#8221;


28CHAPTER IIITHE FEDERAL POLICY

Weegman was startled. &#8220;What&#8211;what&#8217;s
that?&#8221; he spluttered, staring
upward at the towering figure in
white. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;

&#8220;Just what I&#8217;ve said,&#8221; replied the pitcher
grimly. &#8220;Under no circumstances would I think
of stepping into old Jack Kennedy&#8217;s shoes; but
even if he were a perfect stranger to me you could
not inveigle me into the management of the Blue
Stockings on the conditions you have named.
Management!&#8221; he scoffed. &#8220;Why, the man who
falls for that will be a tame cat with clipped claws.
It&#8217;s evident, Mr. Weegman, that you&#8217;ve made a
long journey for nothing.&#8221;

For a moment the visitor was speechless. Lefty
Locke&#8217;s modest, unassuming ways, coupled with
undoubted ambition and a desire to get on, had led
Charles Collier&#8217;s secretary to form a very erroneous
estimate of him.

&#8220;But, man alive,&#8221; said Weegman, &#8220;do you
realize what you&#8217;re doing? You&#8217;re turning down
29
the chance of a lifetime. I have the contract right
here in my pocket, with Collier&#8217;s name properly
attached and witnessed. If you doubt my authority
to put the deal through, I can show you my
power of attorney from Mr. Collier. In case sentiment
or gratitude is holding you back, let me tell
you that under no circumstances will Kennedy
again be given control of the team. Now don&#8217;t be
a chump and&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;If I were in your place,&#8221; interrupted Locke,
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t waste any more breath.&#8221;

Weegman snapped his fingers, and got up. &#8220;I
won&#8217;t! I didn&#8217;t suppose you were quite such a
boob.&#8221;

&#8220;But you did suppose I was boob enough to
swallow your bait at a gulp. You thought me so
conceited and greedy that I would jump at the
chance to become a puppet, a manager in name
only, without any real authority or control. It&#8217;s
plainly your purpose to be the real manager of
the team, for what reason or design I admit I don&#8217;t
quite understand. Just how you hypnotized
Charles Collier and led him to consent to such a
scheme I can&#8217;t say; but I do say that no successful
ball team has ever been run in such a way. You&#8217;re
not fit to manage a ball club, and you wouldn&#8217;t dare
assume the title as well as the authority; probably
you know Collier wouldn&#8217;t stand for that. Yet
30
you intend to force your dictation upon a pseudo-manager.
Such meddling would mean muddling;
it would knock the last ounce of starch out of the
team. If the Blue Stockings didn&#8217;t finish a bad
tailender it would be a miracle.&#8221;

Bailey Weegman was furious all the way
through, but still he laughed and snapped his
fingers.

&#8220;You&#8217;re a wise guy, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; he sneered.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t dream you were so shrewd and discerning.
Now let me tell you something, my knowing
friend: I&#8217;ve tried to save your neck, and you
won&#8217;t have it.&#8221;

&#8220;My neck!&#8221; exclaimed the pitcher incredulously.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve tried to save my neck?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, I know your old soup bone&#8217;s on the blink;
you didn&#8217;t put anything over me by dodging and
trimming when I questioned you about your arm.
You knocked it out last year, and you&#8217;ve been
spending the winter down here trying to work it
back into shape. You can pitch a little against
weak bush teams, but you can&#8217;t even go the whole
distance against one of them. That being the
case, what sort of a figure do you expect to cut
back in the Big League? Up against the slugging
Wolves or the hard-hitting Hornets, how long
would you last? I&#8217;ve got your number, and you
know it.&#8221;

31&#8220;If that&#8217;s so, it seems still more remarkable that
you should wish to hold me. Certainly I&#8217;d be a
great addition to a pitching staff that&#8217;s smashed
already!&#8221;

&#8220;Did I say anything about your strengthening
the pitching staff? I offered to engage you in
another capacity. Think I didn&#8217;t know why you
declined to dicker with the Feds when they made
you a big offer? You didn&#8217;t dare, for you know
you couldn&#8217;t deliver the goods. Having that
knowledge under my hat, I&#8217;ve been mighty generous
with you.&#8221; Weegman descended to the top
step, chuckling.

&#8220;Good night,&#8221; said Locke, longing to hasten the
man&#8217;s departure.

&#8220;Think it over,&#8221; invited Charles Collier&#8217;s representative.
&#8220;Now that I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;ll stick around
and watch you pitch against these bushwhacking
Wind Jammers to-morrow. I imagine your efforts
should be amusing. Perhaps you&#8217;ll change
your mind before I catch the train north at Yulee.&#8221;
His chuckling became open laughter.

Lefty turned and entered the cottage, while
Weegman walked away in the moonlight, the smoke
of his cigar drifting over his shoulder.

Certain circumstances had led Philip Hazelton
to enter professional baseball under the pseudonym
of &#8220;Tom Locke,&#8221; to which, as he was a left-hander,
32
his associates had added the nickname of
&#8220;Lefty.&#8221; These names had stuck when he
abruptly moved upward into the Big League. His
rise having been rocketlike, the pessimistic and
the envious had never wholly ceased to look for
the fall of a stick. Thus far, in spite of the fact
that each year of his service with the Blue Stockings
saw him shouldering more and more of the
pitching load, until like Jack Coombs and Ed
Walsh he had become known as &#8220;the Iron Man,&#8221;
they had looked in vain. And it came to pass that
even the most prejudiced was forced to admit that
it was Lefty who kept his team &#8220;up there&#8221; fighting
for the bunting all the time.

Toward the close of the last season, however,
with the jinx in close pursuit of the Blue Stockings,
Locke had pushed himself beyond the limit.
At one time the club had seemed to have the pennant
cinched, but through the crippling of players
it had begun to slip in the latter part of the season.
In the desperate struggle to hold on, going
against Manager Kennedy&#8217;s judgment and advice,
Lefty did more pitching than any other two
men on the staff, and with a little stronger team
to support him his winning percentage would have
been the highest of any pitcher in the league. It
was not his fault that the Blue Stockings did not
finish better than third.

33In the cozy living room of the little furnished
cottage Locke had leased for the brief winter
months a remarkably pretty young woman sat
reading by a shaded lamp. She looked up from
the magazine and smiled at him as he came in.
Then she saw the serious look upon his face, and
the smile faded.

&#8220;What is it, Phil?&#8221; she asked, with a touch of
anxiety. &#8220;Is anything wrong?&#8221;

He sat down, facing her, and told her all about
his interview with Bailey Weegman. As she listened,
her mobile face betrayed wonderment, annoyance,
and alarm.

&#8220;It&#8217;s a raw deal for Kennedy,&#8221; he asserted in
conclusion; &#8220;and I believe it&#8217;s wholly of Weegman&#8217;s
devising. I&#8217;m sure, when the season ended,
Collier had no idea of changing managers. There
isn&#8217;t a more resourceful, astute man in the business
than old Jack.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re always thinking of others, Phil,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;How about yourself? What will happen
to you if you don&#8217;t come to Weegman&#8217;s terms?&#8221;

&#8220;Hard to tell,&#8221; he admitted frankly. &#8220;In fact,
I&#8217;ve been wondering just where I&#8217;d get off. If
my arm fails to come back&#8211;&#8221;

She uttered a little cry. &#8220;But you&#8217;ve been telling
me&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;That it was growing better, Janet, that&#8217;s true.
34
But still it&#8217;s not what it should be, and I don&#8217;t
dare put much of a strain on it. I don&#8217;t know
that I&#8217;d last any time at all in real baseball.
Weegman is wise, yet he offered me a contract to
pitch and to manage the team. On paper it would
seem that he had retained one star twirler for the
staff, but if I failed to come back we wouldn&#8217;t
have a single first-string slabman. As a manager,
I would be sewed up so that I couldn&#8217;t do anything
without his consent. There&#8217;s a nigger in the
woodpile, Janet.&#8221;

She had put the magazine aside, and clasped her
hands in her lap. He went on:

&#8220;It looks to me as if somebody is trying to
punch holes in the team, though I don&#8217;t get the
reason for it. Following Jack Kennedy&#8217;s advice,
I&#8217;ve invested every dollar I could save in the stock
of the club. As Weegman says, it&#8217;s doubtful if
the stock would bring fifty cents on the dollar at
a forced sale to-day. Collier has met with heavy
financial reverses in other lines. He&#8217;s sick, and
he&#8217;s in Europe where no one can communicate
with him. Is somebody trying to knock the bottom
out of his baseball holdings in order to get
control of the club? It looks that way from the
offing.&#8221;

&#8220;But you,&#8221; said Janet, still thinking of her husband,
&#8220;you&#8217;re not tied up with Weegman, and the
35
Federals have made you a splendid offer. You
can accept that and land on your feet.&#8221;

He smiled, shaking his head slowly. &#8220;There
are several reasons why I don&#8217;t care to follow that
course. The first, and strongest, is my loyalty to
Jack Kennedy, the man who gave me a square
deal. Then I don&#8217;t care to bunko anybody, and
unless my arm comes back I won&#8217;t be worth the
money the Feds have offered for my services.
Lastly, I&#8217;m not sure the new league is going to
be strong enough to win out against organized
baseball.&#8221;

&#8220;But you&#8217;ve said that they seem to have plenty
of money behind them. You&#8217;ve said, too, that
their plan of dealing directly with players, instead
of buying and selling them like chattels or slaves,
was the only system that gave the players a just
and honest deal.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; affirmed Lefty. &#8220;Slavery in
baseball is something more than a joke. The organization
has been one of the biggest trusts in
the country, and it has dealt in human beings. It
has been so that when a man signed his first contract
he signed away his right to say what he
would do as long as he remained in the game.
After that he could be bought, sold, or traded
without receiving a dollar of the purchasing or
trading price. He had to go where he was sent,
36
regardless of his personal likes, wishes, or convenience.
He had to accept whatever salary a
manager chose to give him, or get out. Even if
his contract had expired with one manager, he
couldn&#8217;t go to another and make a bargain, no
matter how much the other manager was willing
to give him; the reserve clause held him chained
hand and foot. To-day, if the powers chose, I
could be sent down to the minors at any old salary
the minors chose to pay. I could be sold, like a
horse or a dog, and if I didn&#8217;t like it I could quit
the game. That would be my only recourse.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s terribly unfair,&#8221; said Janet.

&#8220;Unfair? That&#8217;s a tame word! On the other
hand, the Federals are dealing directly with the
players. If they think he&#8217;s worth it, they give a
man a good salary and a bonus besides. The
bonus goes to the player, not to the club owner.
Added to that, the Federal contracts provide that
a club must increase a player&#8217;s salary at least five
per cent. each year, or give him his unconditional
release, thus making it possible for him to deal
with any other club that may want him.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s plain your sympathy is with the Federals.&#8221;

&#8220;If they&#8217;re not trying to jack up organized baseball
and sell out,&#8221; said Lefty, &#8220;I hope they come
through.&#8221;


37CHAPTER IVTHE MAGNETIZED BALL

&#8220;What are your plans?&#8221; asked Janet,
after they had discussed the situation
in all its phases. &#8220;Have you
decided on anything?&#8221;

The southpaw answered: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to put
Jack Kennedy wise. I&#8217;m going to write him a
letter to-night, and I shall send him a telegram as
soon as the office opens in the morning. It&#8217;s up
to him to get in communication with Collier if
there&#8217;s any way of doing it. You have not received
a letter from Virginia lately?&#8221;

Virginia Collier, the charming daughter of the
owner of the Blue Stockings, was Janet&#8217;s closest
friend.

&#8220;No, I have not heard from her in over three
weeks, and I don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; returned his
wife.

&#8220;She seems to have stepped off the map, along
with her father. The whole business is mysterious.
Why don&#8217;t you write her at once, explaining
what is going on, and send the letter to her
last address?&#8221;

38&#8220;I will.&#8221;

&#8220;It may not reach her, but there&#8217;s no harm in
trying. Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll get busy on mine to Kennedy.
There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much chance to
spike Weegman&#8217;s guns, but it&#8217;s worth trying.&#8221;

Locke had the knack of writing a succinct letter;
the one he wrote old Jack was concise, yet it
was clear and complete. Within two minutes
after opening it, doubtless Kennedy would know
as much about the situation as did Lefty himself.
Yet it was probable that, like the pitcher, the manager
would be mystified by the surprising and
seemingly sinister maneuvers of Bailey Weegman.

Following Lefty&#8217;s advice, Janet wrote to Virginia
Collier.

Locke rose early the following morning and
posted the letters for the first outward mail. He
sent a telegram also. Returning past the Magnolia
Hotel, to his surprise he perceived Collier&#8217;s
private secretary sitting on the veranda, smoking.
Weegman beamed and chuckled.

&#8220;Morning,&#8221; he cried, waving his cigar between
two fingers. &#8220;The early bird, eh? Been firing
off a little correspondence, I presume. Our communications
will reach Kennedy in the same mail;
and I wired him, too. Quite a little jolt for the
old man, but it can&#8217;t be helped. Of course, he&#8217;ll
have the sense to bow gracefully to the inevitable,
39
and that will clear the air. Afterward, perhaps,
you may change your mind regarding my offer.&#8221;

&#8220;Perhaps so,&#8221; returned Lefty pleasantly.
&#8220;But if I do, I shall be a fit subject for a padded
cell.&#8221; The agreeable look was wiped from Weegman&#8217;s
face as Locke passed on.

Some time after breakfast Lefty returned to
the Magnolia to learn if Cap&#8217;n Wiley and his ball
players had arrived. Approaching, he perceived
a queer assortment of strangers lounging on the
veranda, and from their appearance he judged
that they were members of the team. Many of
them looked like old stagers, veterans who had
seen better days; some were youthful and raw and
inclined to be cock-a-hoop. There was a German,
an Italian, an Irishman, and a Swede. One was
lanky as a starved greyhound, and apparently
somewhere near six feet and six inches tall from
his heels to his hair roots. Another was short and
fat, and looked as if he had been driven together
by some one who had hit him over the head with
a board.

In a way, these strangers in Fernandon were
most remarkable for their attire. With scarcely
an exception, the clothes they wore were weird
and fantastic samples of sartorial art; various,
and nearly all, prevailing freaks of fashion were
displayed. With colored shirts, flaring socks, and
40
giddy neckties, they caused all beholders to gasp.
They were most amazingly bejeweled and adorned.
With difficulty Locke suppressed a smile as his
quick eyes surveyed them.

Near the head of the broad steps leading up to
the veranda sat a somewhat stocky but exceptionally
well-built man of uncertain age. He was almost
as swarthy as an Indian, and his dark eyes
were swift and keen and shrewd. His black hair
was graying on the temples. His coat and trousers,
of extravagant cut, were made from pronounced
black-and-white-striped material. His
fancy waistcoat, buttoned with a single button at
the bottom, was adorned with large orange-colored
figures. His silk socks were red, his four-in-hand
necktie was purple, and the band that encircled
the straw hat cocked rakishly upon his head
was green. He was smoking a cigar and pouring
a steady flow of words into the ear of Bailey
Weegman, who made a pretense of not noticing
Locke.

&#8220;Yes, mate,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;old man Breckenridge
was the most painfully inconsiderate batter
I ever had the misfortune to pitch against.
Smoke, curves, twisters, slow balls, low balls, and
high balls&#8211;they all looked alike to him. Now I
have a preference; I prefer a high ball, Scotch and
carbonic. But it made no difference to Breck;
41
when he put his fifty-five-ounce ash wand against
the pill, said pill made a pilgrimage&#8211;it journeyed
right away to some land distant and remote and
unknown, and it did not stay upon the order of its
going. When it came right down to slugging,
compared with old Breck your Home-run Bakers
and Honus Wagners and Napoleon Lajoies are
puny and faded shines. And he always seemed
able to make connections when he desired; if he
rambled forth to the dish yearning for a hit, there
was no known method by which the most astute
and talented pitcher could prevent him from hitting.&#8221;

&#8220;Quite a wonder, I must admit!&#8221; laughed
Weegman, in high amusement. &#8220;Rather strange
the Big Leagues didn&#8217;t get hold of such a marvelous
batsman, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, he was on the roster of some Class A team
at various times, but he had one drawback that
finally sent him away to the remote and uncharted
bushes: &#8216;Charley horse&#8217; had him in its invidious
grip. A spavined snail could beat Breck making
the circuit of the sacks, and cross the pan pulled
up. Yet, with this handicap, the noble old slugger
held the record for home runs in the Tall
Grass League. Naturally I had heart failure and
Angie Pectoris every time I was compelled to face
him on the slab. Likewise, naturally I began
42
meditating with great vigor upon a scheme to circumvent
the old terror, and at last my colossal
brain concocted a plan that led me to chortle with
joy.&#8221;

&#8220;I am deeply interested and curious,&#8221; declared
Weegman, as the narrator paused, puffing complacently
at his weed. &#8220;Go on.&#8221;

Locke had stopped near at hand, and was listening.
Others were hovering about, their ears open,
their faces wreathed in smiles.

&#8220;It was a simple matter of scientific knowledge
and a little skulduggery,&#8221; pursued the story-teller
obligingly. &#8220;I possessed the knowledge, and I
bribed the bat boy of old Breck&#8217;s team to perform
the skulduggery. I sent to the factory and had
some special baseballs manufactured for me, and
in the heart of each ball was hidden a tiny but
powerful magnet. Then I secretly furnished the
rascally bat boy with a specially prepared steel rod
that would violently repel any magnet that chanced
to wander around into the immediate vicinity of
the rod. I instructed the boy to bore Breck&#8217;s pet
bat surreptitiously when the shades of night had
fallen, insert the steel rod, and then craftily plug
the hole. And may I never sail the briny deep
again if that little scoundrel didn&#8217;t carry out my
instructions with the skill of a cutthroat, or a diplomat,
even! Nature intended him for higher
43
things. If he isn&#8217;t hanged some day it won&#8217;t be
his fault.

&#8220;Well, the next time old Breck brought his team
to play against us upon our field, I used the magnetized
baseballs. I was doing the hurling and
in the very first inning the old swatter came up
with the sacks charged and two out. He smiled a
smile of pity as he bent his baleful glance upon me.
&#8216;You'd better walk me, Walter,&#8217; says he, &#8216;and
force a run; for if you put the spheroid over I&#8217;m
going to give it a long ride.&#8217; I returned his smile
with one of the most magnanimous contempt.
&#8216;Don't blow up, old boy,&#8217; says I. &#8216;With the exception
of your batting, you&#8217;re all in; and I&#8217;ve a
notion that your batting eye is becoming dim and
hazy. Let&#8217;s see you hit this.&#8217; Then I passed
him a slow, straight one right over the middle of
the rubber. He took a mighty swing at it, meaning
to slam it over into the next county. Well,
mate, may I be keelhauled if that ball didn&#8217;t dodge
the bat like a scared rabbit! Mind you, I hadn&#8217;t
put a thing on it, but the repulsion of that deneoutronized
steel rod hidden in the bat forced the
ball to take the handsomest drop you ever beheld,
and the violence with which old Breck smote the
vacant ozone caused him to spin round and concuss
upon the ground when he sat down. It was
a tremendous shock to his nervous system, and it
44
filled me with unbounded jubilance; for I knew I
had him at my mercy, literally in the hollow of my
hand.

&#8220;He rose painfully, chagrined and annoyed, but
still confident. &#8216;Give me another like that, you
little wart!&#8217; he ordered savagely, &#8216;and I&#8217;ll knock
the peeling off it.&#8217; Beaming, I retorted: &#8216;You
couldn&#8217;t knock the peeling off a prune. Here&#8217;s
what you called for.&#8217; And I threw him another
slow, straight one.

&#8220;Excuse these few tears; the memory of that
hallowed occasion makes me cry for joy. He did
it again, concussing still more shockingly when he
sat down. It was simply an utter impossibility
for him to hit that magnetized ball with his doctored
bat. But, of course, he didn&#8217;t know what
the matter was; he thought I was fooling him with
some sort of a new drop I had discovered. The
fact that I was passing him the merry cachinnation
peeved him vastly. When he got upon his
pins and squared away for the third attempt, his
face was the most fearsome I ever have gazed
upon. He shook his big bat at me. &#8216;One more,&#8217;
he raged; &#8216;give me one more, and drop flat on your
face the moment you pitch the ball, or I&#8217;ll drive it
straight through the meridian of your anatomy!&#8217;

&#8220;Let me tell you now, mate, that Breck was a
gentleman, and that was the first and only time
45
I ever knew him to lose his temper. Under the
circumstances, he was excusable. I put all my
nerve-shattering steam into the next pitch, and, instead
of dropping, the ball hopped over his bat
when he smote at it. I had fanned the mighty
Breckenridge, and the wondering crowd lifted
their voices in hosannas. Yet I know they regarded
it in the nature of an accident, and not until
I had whiffed him three times more in the same
game did either Breck or the spectators arrive at
the conviction that I had something on him.

&#8220;After that,&#8221; said the narrator, as if in conclusion,
&#8220;I had him eating out of my hand right
up to the final and decisive game of the season.&#8221;

Weegman begged the fanciful romancer to tell
what happened in the last game.

&#8220;Oh, we won,&#8221; was the assurance; &#8220;but we
never would have if Breck had been wise the last
time he came to bat. It was in the ninth inning,
with the score three to two in our favor, two
down, and runners on second and third. Knowing
it was Breck&#8217;s turn to hit, I was confident we
had the game sewed up. But the confidence oozed
out of me all of a sudden when I saw the big fellow
paw the clubs over to select a bat other than
his own. Clammy perspiration started forth
from every pore of my body. With any other
swat stick beside his own, I knew he was practically
46
sure to drive any ball I could pitch him
over the fence. The agony of apprehension which
I endured at that moment gave me my first gray
hairs.

&#8220;Although I did not know it at the time, it
chanced that Breck had selected the bat of another
player who had had it bored and loaded with
an ordinary steel rod. This, you can clearly understand,
made it more than doubly certain that
he would hit the magnetized ball, which would be
attracted instead of repelled. Had I known this,
I shouldn&#8217;t have had the heart to pitch at all.

&#8220;As the noble warrior stood up to the pan, I considered
what I could pitch him. Curves could not
fool him, and he literally ate speed. Therefore,
without hope, I tossed him up a slow one. Now it
chanced that the old boy had decided to try a surprise,
having become disheartened by his efforts
to slug; he had resolved to attempt to bunt, knowing
such a move would be unexpected. So he
merely stuck out his bat as the sphere came sailing
over. The magnet was attracted by the steel
rod, and the ball just jumped at the bat, against
which it struck&#8211;and stuck! I hope never to tell
the truth again, mate, if I&#8217;m not stating a simple,
unadulterated, unvarnished fact. The moment
the ball touched the bat it stuck fast to it as if
nailed there. Breck was so astonished that he
47
stood in his tracks staring at the ball like a man
turned to stone. I was likewise paralyzed for an
extemporaneous fraction of time, but my ready
wit quickly availed me. Bounding forward, I
wrenched the ball from the bat and tagged old
Breck with it, appealing to the umpire for judgment.
There was only one thing his umps could
do. He had seen the batter attempt to bunt, had
seen bat and ball meet, and had seen me secure
the ball on fair ground and put it on to the hitter.
He declared Breckenridge out, and that gave us
the game and the championship.&#8221;

Bailey Weegman lay back and roared. In doing
so, he seemed to perceive Lefty for the first
time. As soon as he could get his breath, he said:

&#8220;Oh, I say, Locke, let me introduce you. This is
Cap&#8217;n Wiley, owner and manager of the Wind
Jammers.&#8221;


48CHAPTER VA MAN OF MYSTERY

The swarthy little fabulist rose hastily to
his feet, making a quick survey of the
southpaw. &#8220;Am I indeed and at last in
the presence of the great Lefty Locke?&#8221; he cried,
his face beaming like the morning sun in a cloudless
sky. &#8220;Is it possible that after many weary
moons I have dropped anchor in the same harbor
with the most salubriously efficacious port-side
flinger of modern times? Pardon my deep emotion!
Slip me your mudhook, Lefty; let me give
you the fraternal grip.&#8221;

He grabbed Locke&#8217;s hand and wrung it vigorously,
while the other members of the Wind Jammers
pressed nearer, looking the Big League
pitcher over with interest.

&#8220;In many a frozen igloo,&#8221; declared Wiley, &#8220;I
have dreamed of this day when I should press
your lily-white fingers. Oft and anon during my
weary sojourn in that far land of snow and ice
have I pictured to myself the hour when we should
stand face to face and exchange genuflections and
49
greetings. And whenever a smooched and tattered
months-old newspaper would drift in from
civilization, with what eager and expectant thrills
did I tremulously turn to the baseball page that
I might perchance read thereon how you had stung
the Hornets, bitten the Wolves, clipped the claws
of the Panthers, or plucked the feathers from the
White Wings!&#8221;

&#8220;And I have been wondering,&#8221; confessed Lefty,
&#8220;if you could be the original Cap&#8217;n Wiley of whom
I heard so many strange tales in my boyhood.
It was reported that you were dead.&#8221;

&#8220;Many a time and oft hath that canard been circulated.
According to rumor, I have demised a
dozen times or more by land and sea; but each
time, like the fabled Ph&oelig;nix, I have risen from my
ashes. During the last few fleeting years I have
been in pursuit of fickle fortune in far-off Alaska,
where it was sometimes so extremely cold that fire
froze and we cracked up the congealed flames into
little chunks which we sold to the Chilkoots and Siwashes
as precious bright red stones. Strange
to say, whenever I have related this little nanny
goat it has been received with skepticism and incredulity.
The world is congested with doubters.&#8221;

&#8220;When you wrote me,&#8221; admitted Locke, &#8220;proposing
to bring your Wind Jammers here to play
50
the Fernandon Grays, I thought the letter was a
hoax. At first I was tempted not to answer it,
and when I did reply it was out of curiosity more
than anything else; I wanted to see what the next
twist of the joke would be.&#8221;

&#8220;Let me assure you that you will find playing
against the Wind Jammers no joke. I have conglomerated
together the fastest segregation of
baseball stars ever seen outside a major league
circuit, and I say it with becoming and blushing
modesty. Look them over,&#8221; he invited, with a
proud wave of his hand toward the remarkable
group of listeners. &#8220;It has always been my contention
that there are just as good players to be
found outside the Big League as ever wore the
uniform of a major. I have held that hard luck,
frowning fate, or contumelious circumstances
have conspired to hold these natural-born stars
down and prevent their names from being chiseled
on the tablet of fame. Having gathered unto myself
a few slippery shekels from my mining ventures
in the land where baseball games begin at
the hour of midnight, I have now set out to prove
my theory, and before I am through I expect to
have all balldom sitting up agog and gasping with
wonderment.&#8221;

&#8220;I wish you luck,&#8221; replied Lefty. &#8220;If you
51
don&#8217;t do anything else, you ought to get some sport
out of it. I presume you still ascend the mound
as a pitcher?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh,&#8221; was the airy answer, &#8220;on rare occasions
I give the gaping populace a treat by propelling
the sphere through the atmosphere. When my
projector is working up to its old-time form, I find
little difficulty in leading the most formidable batters
to vainly slash the vacant ether. The weather
seeming propitious, I may burn a few over this
p.m. I trust you will pitch also.&#8221;

&#8220;I think I shall start the game, at least.&#8221;

Bailey Weegman butted in. &#8220;But he won&#8217;t finish
it, Wiley. Like yourself, he&#8217;s not doing as
much pitching as he did once.&#8221; His laugh was
significant.

The owner of the Wind Jammers looked
startled. &#8220;Tell me not in mournful numbers that
your star is already on the decline!&#8221; he exclaimed,
looking at Locke with regret. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the
Big Leagues do to a good man; they burn him out
like a pitch-pine knot. I&#8217;ve felt all along that the
Blue Stockings were working you too much, Lefty.
Without you on their roster ready to work three
or four times a week in the pinches, they never
could have kept in the running.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re more than complimentary,&#8221; said
52
Locke, after giving Weegman a look. &#8220;But I
think I&#8217;ll be able to shake something out of my
sleeve this season, the same as ever.&#8221;

&#8220;Then don&#8217;t let them finish you, don&#8217;t let them
grind you to a frazzle,&#8221; advised Wiley. &#8220;For the
first time in recent history you have a chance for
your white alley; the Federals are giving you that.
If you&#8217;re not already enmeshed in the folds of a
contract, the Feds will grab you and hand you a
square deal.&#8221;

Weegman rose, chuckling and snapping his fingers.
&#8220;All this talk about what the Feds can do
is gas!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting nothing
but the soreheads and deadwood of organized baseball,
which will be vastly better off without the deserters.
Cripples and has-beens may make a
good thing out of the Feds for a short time. Perhaps
Locke would find it profitable to jump.&#8221; His
meaning was all too plain.

Lefty felt like taking the insinuating fellow by
the neck and shaking him until his teeth rattled,
but outwardly he was not at all ruffled or disturbed.
&#8220;Mr. Weegman,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is showing
pique because I have not seen fit to sign up as manager
of the Blue Stockings. He professes to have
authority from Charles Collier to sign the manager,
Collier having gone abroad for his health.&#8221;

&#8220;If anybody doubts my authority,&#8221; shouted
53
Weegman, plunging his hand into an inner pocket
of his coat, &#8220;I can show the documents that
will&#8211;&#8221;

The southpaw had turned his back on him. &#8220;I
understand you have a clever pitcher in the man
known as Mysterious Jones, Wiley,&#8221; he said.

&#8220;A pippin!&#8221; was the enthusiastic answer.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a chance to see him sagaciate to-day.&#8221;

&#8220;He is a deaf-mute?&#8221;

&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t hear a cannon if you fired it right
under the lobe of his ear, and he does his talking
with his prehensile digits. Leon Ames in his best
days never had anything on Jones.&#8221;

&#8220;Strange I never even heard of him. Our
scouts have scoured the bushes from one end of
the country to the other.&#8221;

&#8220;I never collided with any baseball scouts in
Alaska,&#8221; said Wiley.

&#8220;Oh! You found Jones in Alaska?&#8221;

&#8220;Pitching for a team in Nome.&#8221;

&#8220;But baseball up there! I didn&#8217;t know&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, no; nobody ever thinks of baseball up
there, but in the all too short summer season
there&#8217;s something doing in that line. Why, even
modern dances have begun to run wild in Alaska,
so you see they&#8217;re right up to the present jiffy.&#8221;

&#8220;Where did this Jones originally hail from?&#8221;

54&#8220;Ask me! I don&#8217;t know. Nobody I ever met
knew anything about him, and what he knows
about himself he won&#8217;t tell. He&#8217;s mysterious, you
understand; but his beautiful work on the slab
has caused my classic countenance to break into
ripples and undulations and convolutions of
mirth.&#8221;

&#8220;Where is he? I&#8217;d like to give him the once
over.&#8221;

&#8220;I think he&#8217;s out somewhere prowling around
the town and sizing up the citizens. That&#8217;s one
of his little vagaries; he has a combustable curiosity
about strangers. Every place we go he
wanders around for hours lamping the denizens
of the burg. Outside baseball, strange people
seem to interest him more than anything in the
world; but once he has taken a good square look
at a person, henceforth and for aye that individual
ceases to attract him; if he ever gives anybody
a second look, it is one of absolute indifference.
Oh, I assure you with the utmost voracity
that Jones is an odd one.&#8221;

&#8220;He must be,&#8221; agreed Lefty.

&#8220;Ay tank, cap&#8217;n,&#8221; said Oleson, the Swede outfielder,
&#8220;that Yones now bane comin&#8217; up the
street.&#8221;

Wiley turned and gazed at an approaching figure.
55
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s him. Turn your
binnacle lights on him, Lefty; behold the greatest
pitcher adrift in the uncharted regions of baseball.&#8221;


56CHAPTER VIPECULIAR BEHAVIOR

Jones was rather tall and almost slender,
although he had a fine pair of shoulders.
His arm was as long as Walter Johnson&#8217;s.
His face was as grave as that of the Sphinx, and
held more than a touch of the same somber sadness.
His eyes were dark and keen and penetrating;
with a single glance they seemed to pierce
one through and through. And they were ever
on the move, like little ferrets, searching, searching,
searching. As he approached the hotel, he
met a man going in the opposite direction, and he
half paused to give the man a sharp, lance-like
stare. Involuntarily the man drew aside a trifle
and, walking on, turning to look back with an expression
of mingled questioning and resentment.
But Jones had resumed his habitual pace, his appearance
that of a person who, already overburdened,
had received one more disappointment.

Barney O&#8217;Reilley, the shortstop, laughed.
&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it&#8217;s a bit of a jump old Jonesy
hands any one he looks at fair and hard.&#8221;

57Lefty Locke felt a throb of deep interest and
curiosity. There was something about the deaf-mute
pitcher of the Wind Jammers that aroused
and fascinated him instantly. His first thought
was that the man might be mentally unbalanced
to a slight degree; but, though he knew not why,
something caused him to reject this conviction almost
before it was formed. Apparently Jones
was well named &#8220;Mysterious.&#8221;

&#8220;There&#8217;s the bird, Lefty,&#8221; said Cap&#8217;n Wiley
proudly. &#8220;There&#8217;s the boy who&#8217;d make &#8217;em sit
up and take notice if ever he got a show in the
Big League. Yours truly, the Marine Marvel,
knew what he was doing when he plucked that
plum in the far-away land of lingering snows.&#8221;

A queer sound behind him, like a hissing, shuddering
gasp, caused Locke to look around quickly.
The sound had come from Weegman, who, face
blanched, mouth agape, eyes panic-stricken, was
staring at the approaching pitcher. Amazement,
doubt, disbelief, fear&#8211;he betrayed all these emotions.
Even while he leaned forward to get a
better view over the shoulder of a man before him,
he shrank back, crouching like one ready to take
to his heels.

Like a person pleased by the sound of his own
voice, Cap&#8217;n Wiley rattled on in laudation of his
mute pitcher. No one save Locke seemed to notice
58
Weegman; and so wholly fascinated by the sight
of Jones was the latter that he was quite oblivious
to the fact that he had attracted any attention.

&#8220;Smoke!&#8221; Wiley was saying. &#8220;Why, mate,
when he uses all his speed, a ball doesn&#8217;t last a
minute; the calorie friction it creates passing
through the air burns the cover off.&#8221;

&#8220;Ya,&#8221; supplemented Shaeffer, the catcher,
&#8220;und sometimes it sets my mitt afire.&#8221;

&#8220;Some speed!&#8221; agreed Lefty, as Jones, his head
bent, reached the foot of the steps. &#8220;He looks
tired.&#8221;

&#8220;He&#8217;s always that way after he tramps around
a strange town,&#8221; said the owner of the Wind
Jammers. &#8220;Afterward he usually goes to bed
and rests, and he comes out to the games as full
of fire and kinks as a boy who has stuffed himself
with green apples. I&#8217;ll introduce you, Locke.&#8221;

The southpaw looked round again. Weegman
was gone; probably he had vanished into the convenient
door of the hotel. Cap&#8217;n Wiley drew
Lefty forward to meet the voiceless pitcher, and,
perceiving a stranger, Mysterious Jones halted at
the top of the steps and stabbed him with a stare
full in the face. Lefty had never looked into
such searching, penetrating eyes.

Wiley made some deft and rapid movements
59
with his hands and fingers, using the deaf-and-dumb
language to make Jones aware of the identity
of the famous Big League pitcher. Already
the mute had lapsed into disappointed indifference,
but he accepted Locke&#8217;s offered hand and
smiled in a faint, melancholy way.

&#8220;He&#8217;s feeling especially downcast to-day,&#8221; explained
Wiley, &#8220;and so he&#8217;ll pitch like a fiend this
afternoon. He always twirls his best when he&#8217;s
gloomiest; appears to entertain the delusion that
he&#8217;s taking acrimonious revenge on the world for
handing him some sort of a raw deal. It would
be a shame to use him against you the whole game,
Lefty; he&#8217;d make your Grays look like a lot of infirm
prunes.&#8221;

&#8220;Spare us,&#8221; pleaded Locke, in mock apprehension.

Jones did not linger long with his teammates on
the veranda. With a solemn but friendly bow to
Lefty, he passed on into the hotel, Wiley explaining
that he was on his way to take his regular daily
period of rest. Through the open door the southpaw
watched the strange pitcher walk through the
office and mount a flight of stairs. And from the
little writing room Locke saw Bailey Weegman
peer forth, his eyes following the mysterious one
until the latter disappeared. Then Weegman hurried
60
to the desk and interviewed the clerk, after
which he made an inspection of the names freshly
written upon the hotel register.

The man&#8217;s behavior was singular, and Lefty decided
that, for some reason, Weegman did not care
to encounter Jones. This suspicion was strengthened
when, scarcely more than an hour later,
Charles Collier&#8217;s private secretary appeared at
the little cottage occupied by Locke and his wife,
and stated that he had made a change from the
Magnolia Hotel to the Florida House, a second-rate
and rather obscure place on the edge of the
colored quarter.

&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t stand for Wiley and his gang of bushwhackers,&#8221;
Weegman explained. &#8220;They made
me sick, and I had to get out, even though I&#8217;m going
to leave town at five-thirty this afternoon.
That&#8217;s the first through train north that I can
catch. Thought I&#8217;d let you know so you could find
me in case you changed your mind about that offer.&#8221;

&#8220;You might have spared yourself the trouble,&#8221;
said Locke coldly.

Weegman made a pretense of laughing. &#8220;No
telling about that. Mules are obstinate, but even
they can be made to change their minds if you
build a hot enough fire under them. Don&#8217;t forget
where you can find me.&#8221;

61Lefty watched him walking away, and noted
that his manner was somewhat nervous and unnatural.
&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; murmured the pitcher,
&#8220;why you put yourself to so much discomfort to
avoid Mysterious Jones.&#8221;

Directed by Locke, the Grays put in an hour
of sharp practice that forenoon. As Lefty had
stated, the team was practically comprised of winter
visitors from the North. Some of them had
come South for their health, too. Three were
well along in the thirties, and one had passed
forty. Yet, for all such handicaps, they were an
enthusiastic, energetic team, and they could play
the game. At least five of them had once been
stars on college nines. Having never lost their
love for the game, they had rounded into form
wonderfully under the coaching of the Big League
pitcher. Also, in nearly every game they pulled
off more or less of the stuff known as &#8220;inside baseball.&#8221;

They had been remarkably successful in defeating
the teams they had faced, but Locke felt sure
that, in spite of the conglomerate and freakish appearance
of the Wind Jammers, it was not going
to be an easy thing to take a fall out of Cap&#8217;n
Wiley&#8217;s aggregation of talent. The self-styled
&#8220;Marine Marvel&#8221; had a record; with players
culled from the brambles as he knocked about the
62
country, he had, in former days, put to shame
many a strong minor league outfit that had patronizingly
and somewhat disdainfully consented
to give him an engagement on an off date. Unless
the eccentric and humorously boastful manager
of the Wind Jammers had lost much of his judgment
and cunning during the recent years that he
had been out of the public eye, the fastest independent
team would have to keep awake and get
a fair share of the breaks in order to trounce
him.

Locke warmed up his arm a little, but, even
though he felt scarcely a twinge of the lameness
and stiffness that had given him so much apprehension,
he was cautious. At one time, when the
trouble was the worst, he had not been able to lift
his left hand to his mouth. A massage expert in
Fernandon had done much for him, and he hoped
that he had done not a little for himself by perfecting
a new style of delivery that did not put so
much strain upon his shoulder. Still, until he
should be forced to the test, he could never feel
quite sure that he would be the same puzzle to the
finest batsmen that he had once been. And it
must be confessed that he had looked forward with
some dread to the day when that test should come.

Suddenly he resolved that, in a way, he would
meet the test at once. Doubtless the Wind Jammers
63
were batters of no mean caliber, for Wiley
had always got together a bunch of sluggers.

&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; he decided; &#8220;I&#8217;ll go the limit. If
I can&#8217;t do that now, after the rest I&#8217;ve had and the
doctoring my arm has received, there&#8217;s not one
chance in a thousand that I&#8217;ll ever be able to pitch
in fast company again.&#8221;


64CHAPTER VIITHE TEST

Nearly all Fernandon turned out to the
game. Many residents of the town, as
well as a large number of the visitors
from the North, came in carriages and automobiles.
The covered reserved seats were filled, and,
shielding themselves from the sun with umbrellas,
an eager crowd packed the bleachers. On the
sandy grass ground back of third base a swarm
of chattering, grinning colored people sat and
sprawled. Holding themselves proudly aloof
from the negroes, a group of lanky, sallow &#8220;poor
whites,&#8221; few of whom could read or write, were
displaying their ignorance by their remarks about
the game and the players. The mayor of the town
had consented to act as umpire. At four o&#8217;clock
he called &#8220;play.&#8221;

&#8220;Now we&#8217;re off!&#8221; sang Cap&#8217;n Wiley, waltzing
gayly forth to the coaching position near third.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s where we hoist anchor and get away with
a fair wind.&#8221;

Nuccio, the olive-skinned Italian third baseman,
65
selected his bat and trotted to the pan, grinning at
Locke.

&#8220;Oh, you Lefty!&#8221; said he. &#8220;We gotta your
number.&#8221;

&#8220;Put your marlinespike against the pill and
crack the coating on it,&#8221; urged Wiley.

George Sommers, catcher for the Grays, adjusted
his mask, crouched, signaled. Locke
whipped one over the inside corner, and Nuccio
fouled.

&#8220;Nicked it!&#8221; cried the Marine Marvel. &#8220;Now
bust it on the figurehead and make for the first
mooring. Show our highly steamed friend Lefty
that he&#8217;s got to pitch to-day if he don&#8217;t want the
wind taken out of his sails.&#8221;

The southpaw tried to lead Nuccio into reaching,
but the batter caught himself in his swing. &#8220;Puta
the ball over, Left,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;Don&#8217;t givea
me the walk.&#8221;

The pitcher smiled and handed up a hopper.
The batter fouled again, lifting the ball on to the
top of the covered seats.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you need worry about walking,&#8221;
said Sommers, returning after having made a vain
start in pursuit of the sphere. &#8220;You&#8217;re in a hole
already.&#8221;

Nuccio smiled. &#8220;Wait,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;I spoil
the gooda ones.&#8221;

66Another ball followed, then Lefty warped one
across the comer. Nuccio drove it into right for
a pretty single, bringing shouts of approval from
the bench of the Wind Jammers. Wiley addressed
Locke.

&#8220;Really,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I fear me much that you
undervalue the batting capacity of my players.
One and all, individually and collectively, they
are there with the healthy bingle. Please, I beg
of you, don&#8217;t let them pound you off the slab in
the first inning, for that would puncture a hard-earned
reputation and bring tears of regret to my
tender eyes. For fear that you may be careless
or disdainful, I warn you that this next man can&#8217;t
touch anything down around his knees; his arms
being attached to his shoulders at such a dim and
distant altitude, he finds it difficult to reach down
so far, even with the longest bat.&#8221;

Luther Bemis, the player referred to, was the
marvelously tall and lanky center fielder of the
Wind Jammers. He had a queer halting walk,
like a person on stilts, and his appearance was so
ludicrous that the spectators tittered and laughed
outright. Their amusement did not disturb him,
for he grinned cheerfully as he squared away, waving
his long bat.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t you pay no &#8217;tention to the cap &#8217;n, Lefty,&#8221;
he drawled, in a nasal voice. &#8220;I can hit um acrost
67
the knees jest as well as anywhere else. He&#8217;s
tryin&#8217; to fool ye.&#8221;

&#8220;Let&#8217;s see about that,&#8221; said Locke, putting one
over low and close on the inside.

Bemis smashed out a hot grounder and went galloping
to first with tremendous, ground-covering
strides. For all of his awkward walk and the fact
that he ran like a frightened giraffe, it would have
required an excellent sprinter to beat him from
the plate to the initial sack.

Norris, the shortstop, got his hand on the ball
and stopped it, but it twisted out of his fingers. It
was an error on a hard chance, for by the time he
secured the sphere there was no prospect of getting
either runner.

&#8220;Now that&#8217;s what I call misfortune when regarded
from one angle, and mighty lucky if viewed
from another,&#8221; said Wiley. &#8220;Beamy carries a
rabbit&#8217;s foot; that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s second on our batting
disorder. He does things like that when
they&#8217;re least expected the most.&#8221;

Schaeffer was coaching at first. &#8220;Is it Lefty
Locke against us pitching?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;And such
an easiness! Took a lead, efrybody, and move
along when the Irisher hits.&#8221;

&#8220;I hate to do ut,&#8221; protested Barney O&#8217;Reilley,
shaking his red head as he walked into position.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a pain it gives me, Lefty, but I have to earn
68
me salary. No bad feelings, ould man. You understand.&#8221;

&#8220;Just one moment,&#8221; called Wiley, holding up
his hand. &#8220;Sympathy impels me. I have a tender
heart. Lefty, I feel that I must warn you
again. This descendant of the Irish nobility can
hit anything that sails over the platter. If it
were not a distressing fact that Schepps, who follows,
is even a more royal batter, I would advise
you to walk O&#8217;Reilley. As it is, I am in despair.&#8221;

The crowd was not pleased. It began to beg
Locke to fan O&#8217;Reilley, and when the Irishman
missed the first shoot the pleadings increased.

&#8220;Barney is sympathetic also,&#8221; cried Cap&#8217;n
Wiley; &#8220;but he&#8217;d better not let his sympathy carry
him amain, whatever that is. I shall fine him if
he doesn&#8217;t hit the ball.&#8221;

Locke had begun to let himself out in earnest,
for the situation was threatening. It would not
be wise needlessly to permit the Wind Jammers to
get the jump. They were a confident, aggressive
team, and would fight to the last gasp to hold an
advantage. The southpaw realized that it would
be necessary to do some really high-grade twirling
to prevent them from grabbing that advantage in
short order.

Tug Schepps, a tough-looking, hard-faced person,
was swinging two bats and chewing tobacco
69
as he waited to take his turn. He was a product
of the sand lots.

&#8220;Land on it, Barney, old top!&#8221; urged Tug.
&#8220;Swat it on der trade-mark an&#8217; clean der sacks.
Dis Lefty boy don&#8217;t seem such a much.&#8221;

Locke shot over a high one.

&#8220;Going up!&#8221; whooped O&#8217;Reilley, ignoring it.

&#8220;Get &#8217;em down below the crow&#8217;s nest,&#8221; entreated
Wiley. &#8220;You&#8217;re not pitching to Bemis
now.&#8221;

The southpaw quickly tried a drop across the
batter&#8217;s shoulders, and, not expecting that the ball
had so much on it, Barney let it pass. He made a
mild kick when the mayor-umpire called a strike.
&#8220;It&#8217;s astigmatism ye have, Mr. Mayor,&#8221; he said
politely.

The next one was too close, but O&#8217;Reilley fell
back and hooked it past third base. Even though
the left fielder had been playing in, Nuccio might
possibly have scored had he not stumbled as he
rounded the corner. Wiley started to grab the
fallen runner, but remembered the new rule just
in time, and desisted.

&#8220;Put about!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Head back to the
last port!&#8221;

The Italian scrambled back to the sack, spluttering.
He reached it ahead of the throw from the
fielder. Cap&#8217;n Wiley pretended to shed tears.

70&#8220;Is it possible,&#8221; he muttered, shaking his head,
&#8220;that this is the great Lefty Locke? If so, it
must be true that his star is on the decline. Alas
and alack, life is filled with such bitter disappointments.&#8221;

Whether the regret of Wiley was real or pretended,
it was shared by a large part of the spectators,
who were friendly to the local team; for
Locke had become very well liked in Fernandon,
both by the citizens of the place and the Northern
visitors.

It must not be imagined that, with the corners
crowded and no one down, Locke was fully at his
ease. He had decided to make this game the test
of his ability to &#8220;come back,&#8221; and already it
looked as if the first inning would give him his answer.
If he could not successfully hold in check
this heterogeneous collection of bush talent, it was
easy to understand what would happen to him the
next time he essayed to twirl for the Blue Stockings.
A sickening sense of foreboding crept over
him, but his lips wore a smile, and he showed no
sign of being perturbed.

Schepps was at the plate, having discarded one
of the bats he had been swinging. He grinned like
a Cheshire cat. &#8220;Always t&#8217;ought I could bump a
real league pitcher,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Put one acrost,
pal, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tear der cover off.&#8221;

71Locke hesitated. He had been using the new delivery
he had acquired to spare his shoulder. In
previous games it had proved effective enough to
enable him to continue four or five innings, but
now&#8211;

Suddenly he whipped the ball to third, sending
Nuccio diving headlong back to the sack. The
crafty little Italian had been creeping off, ready to
make a flying dash for the plate. He was safe by
a hair.

&#8220;Not on your movie film!&#8221; cried Cap&#8217;n Wiley.
&#8220;It can&#8217;t be done!&#8221;

Lefty did not hear him. He was gazing past
the Marine Marvel at the face of a man who, taking
care to keep himself unobtrusively in the background,
was peering at him over the shoulders of
a little group of spectators&#8211;a grinning, mocking
derisive face.

It was Weegman. And Weegman knew!


72CHAPTER VIIIAT NECESSITY&#8217;S DEMAND

Even after the ball was thrown back from
third, and Lefty had turned away, that
grinning, mocking face continued to leer
at him. Wherever he looked it hovered before his
mental vision like a taunting omen of disaster.
He was &#8220;all in,&#8221; and Weegman knew it. The
man had told him, with sneering bluntness, that
his &#8220;old soup bone was on the blink.&#8221; Yet, entertaining
this settled conviction regarding Locke&#8217;s
worthlessness as a pitcher, Weegman had made a
long and wearisome journey in order that he might
be absolutely sure, by putting the deal through in
person, of signing the southpaw for the Blue Stockings
at an increased salary. The very fact that
he had been offered the position of manager, under
conditions that would make him a mere puppet
without any real managerial authority, gave the
proposition a blacker and more sinister look.

Sommers was signaling. Lefty shook his head
to rid himself of that hateful chimera. Misunderstanding,
the catcher quickly changed the sign.
73
The pitcher delivered the ball called for first, and
it went through Sommers like a fine shot through
an open sieve.

Nuccio scored from third with ease, Bemis and
O&#8217;Reilley advancing at the same time. The Wind
Jammers roared from the bench. Cap&#8217;n Wiley
threw up his hands.

&#8220;Furl every stitch!&#8221; cried the manager of the
visitors. &#8220;Batten the hatches! The storm is
upon us! It&#8217;s going to be a rip-sizzler. I&#8217;m afraid
the wreck will be a total loss.&#8221;

Covering the plate, Lefty took the ball from
Sommers.

&#8220;How did you happen to cross me?&#8221; asked the
catcher.

&#8220;It was my fault,&#8221; was the prompt acknowledgment;
&#8220;but it won&#8217;t happen again.&#8221;

&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; said Sommers. He wanted to
suggest that Locke should retire at once and let
Matthews take up the pitching, but he refrained.

The southpaw was doing some serious thinking
as he walked back to the mound. However well
his newly acquired delivery had seemed to serve
him on other occasions, he was convinced that it
would not do now; either he must pitch in his own
natural way and do his best, or he must retire and
let Dade Matthews try to check the overconfident
aggressors. If he retired, he would prolong the
74
uncertainty in his own mind; he would leave himself
in doubt as to whether or not there was any
prospect of his return to the Big League as a twirler
worthy of his hire. More than doubt, he realized,
he would be crushed by a conviction that he
was really down and out.

&#8220;I&#8217;ve pampered my arm long enough,&#8221; he decided.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to find out if there&#8217;s anything
left in it.&#8221;

Perhaps the decision was unwise. The result of
the game with the Wind Jammers was of no importance,
but Locke felt that, for his own peace of
mind, he must know what stuff was left in him.
And there was no one present with authority, no
coach, no counselor, to restrain him. There was a
strange, new gleam in his eyes when he once more
toed the slab. His faint smile had not vanished,
but it had taken lines of grimness.

Schepps tapped the plate with his bat. &#8220;Come
on, pal,&#8221; he begged; &#8220;don&#8217;t blow up. Gimme one
of der real kind, an&#8217; lemme have a swat at it.&#8221;

The crowd was silent; even the chattering darkies
had ceased their noise. Only the Wind Jammers
jubilated on the bench and the coaching lines.

Poising himself, Locke caught Sommer&#8217;s signal,
and nodded. Then he swung his arm with the old
free, supple, whiplash motion, and the ball that left
his fingers cut the air like a streak of white, taking
75
a really remarkable hop. Schepps&#8217; &#8220;swat&#8221; was
wasted.

&#8220;Now, dat&#8217;s like it!&#8221; cried the sandlotter.
&#8220;Where&#8217;ve you been keepin&#8217; dat kind, old boy?
Gimme a duplicate.&#8221;

Lefty watched Bemis, the long-legged ground
coverer, working away toward the plate, and drove
him back. But he seemed to have forgotten
O&#8217;Reilley, and the Irishman was taking a lead on
which he should have little trouble in scoring if
Schepps drove out a safety. Farther and farther
he crept up toward third.

Sommers tugged at his mask with an odd little
motion. Like a flash the southpaw whirled about
and shot the ball to second, knowing some one
would be there to take the throw. Mel Gates was
the man who covered the bag, and O&#8217;Reilley found
himself caught between second and third. Gates
went after him, and the Irishman ran toward third.
But Locke had cut in on the line, and he took a
throw from Gates that caused O&#8217;Reilley to turn
back abruptly. Behind Gates, Norris was covering
the cushion. Tremain came down a little from
third to back Lefty up.

Colby had raced from first base to the plate in
order to support Sommers, for Bemis was swiftly
creeping down to make a dash. On the coaching
line, Cap&#8217;n Wiley did a wild dance. The spectators
76
were thrilled by the sudden excitement of the
moment.

Lefty ran O&#8217;Reilley back toward second, and he
knew Bemis was letting himself out in an attempt
to score. Swinging instantly, Locke made a rifle-accurate
throw to Sommers, who jammed the ball
on to the long-geared runner as he was sliding for
the plate. The affair had been so skillfully managed
that not only was O&#8217;Reilley prevented from
advancing, but also the attempt to sneak a tally
while the Irishman was being run down had resulted
disastrously for the Wind Jammers.

&#8220;Dat&#8217;s der only way dey can get us out,&#8221; said
Schepps. &#8220;Dis Lefty person looks to me like a
lemon!&#8221;

Cap&#8217;n Wiley was philosophically cheerful.
&#8220;Just a little lull in the tornado,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
due to strike again in a minute.&#8221;

Lefty looked the confident Schepps over, and
then he gave him a queer drop that deceived him
even worse than the swift hopper. The spectators,
who had been worried a short time before, now expressed
their approval; and when, a minute later,
the southpaw whiffed the sandlotter, there was a
sudden burst of handclapping and explosions of
boisterous laughter from the delighted darkies.

&#8220;Wh-who&#8217;s dat man said lemon?&#8221; cried one.
&#8220;Dat Lefty pusson sho&#8217; handed him one dat time!&#8221;

77&#8220;Is it possible,&#8221; said Cap&#8217;n Wiley, &#8220;that I&#8217;m
going to be compelled to revise my dates regarding
that wreck?&#8221; Then he roared at the Swede:
&#8220;Get into the game, Oleson! It&#8217;s your watch on
deck, and you want to come alive. The wrong
ship&#8217;s being scuttled.&#8221;

&#8220;Aye, aye, captain!&#8221; responded Oleson.
&#8220;Mebbe Ay do somethin&#8217; when Ay get on the yob.
Yust keep your eye on me.&#8221; Believing himself a
hitter superior to the men who had touched Locke
up so successfully at the beginning of the game,
he strode confidently forth, for all of the failure of
Schepps.

Sizing up the Swede, Lefty tested him with a
curve, but Oleson betrayed no disposition to reach.
A drop followed, and the batter fouled it. His
style of swinging led the southpaw to fancy that
he had a preference for drops, and therefore Locke
wound the next one round his neck, puncturing his
weakness. Not only did Oleson miss, but he swung
in a manner that made it doubtful if he would
drive the ball out of the infield if he happened to
hit one of that kind.

&#8220;Hit it where you missed it!&#8221; implored Wiley.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him bamboozle you with the chin
wipers.&#8221; Then he turned on O&#8217;Reilley. &#8220;Cast
off that mooring! Break your anchor loose and
get under way! Man the halyards and crack on
78
every stitch! You&#8217;ve got to make port when Ole
stings the horsehide.&#8221;

In spite of himself, Lefty was compelled to laugh
outright at the Marine Marvel&#8217;s coaching contortions.
&#8220;Calm yourself, cap&#8217;n,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;The
hurricane is over.&#8221;

&#8220;How can I calm myself when calamity threatens?&#8221;
was the wild retort. &#8220;You are a base deceiver,
Lefty. Such chicanery is shameful! I
don&#8217;t know what chicanery means, but it seems to
fit the offense.&#8221;

And now the spectators fell to laughing at the
swarthy little man, who did not seem to be so very
offensive, after all, and who was injecting more
than a touch of vaudeville comedy into the game.

Oleson waited patiently, still determined to hit,
although somewhat dismayed by his two failures
to gauge the left-hander&#8217;s slants. But when Lefty
suddenly gave him another exactly like the last,
he slashed at it awkwardly and fruitlessly. The
crowd broke into a cheer, and the Swede turned
dazedly from the plate, wiping beads of perspiration
from his brow.

&#8220;That Lefty he bane some pitcher,&#8221; admitted
Oleson. &#8220;He got a good yump ball.&#8221;


79CHAPTER IXTORTURING DOUBT

To a degree, Locke had satisfied himself that
he still had command of his speed and
carves; but the experience had also taught
him that his efforts to acquire a new delivery as
effective as his former style of pitching, and one
that would put less strain upon his shoulder, had
been a sheer waste of time. Working against batters
who were dangerous, his artificial delivery
had not enabled him to pitch the ball that would
hold them in check. He had mowed them down,
however, when he had resorted to his natural form.

But what would that do to his shoulder? Could
he pitch like that and go the full distance with no
fear of disastrous results? Should he attempt it,
even should he succeed, perhaps the morrow would
find him with his salary wing as weak and lame
and lifeless as it had been after that last heart-breaking
game in the Big League.

Involuntarily, as he left the mound, he looked
around for Weegman, who had disappeared. It
gave Lefty some satisfaction to feel that, for the
80
time being, at least, he had wiped the mocking
grin from the schemer&#8217;s face.

Cap&#8217;n Wiley jogged down from third, an expression
of injured reproof puckering his countenance.
&#8220;I am pained to the apple core,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My
simple, trusting nature has received a severe shock.
Just when I thought we had you meandering away
from here, Lefty, you turned right round and came
back. If you handed us that one lone tally to chirk
us along, let me reassure you that you made the
mistake of your young life; I am going to ascend
the hillock and do some volleying, which makes it
extensively probable that the run we have garnered
will be sufficient to settle the game.&#8221;

&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so unfeeling!&#8221; responded Locke.
&#8220;Give us Mysterious Jones.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, perchance you may be able to get on the
sacks with me pushing &#8217;em over; but if Jones unlimbered
his artillery on you, he&#8217;d mow you down
as fast as you toddled up to the pentagon. You
see, I wish the assemblage to witness some slight
semblance of a game.&#8221;

In action upon the slab, Wiley aroused still
further merriment. His wind-up before delivering
the ball was most bewildering. His writhing,
squirming twists would have made a circus contortionist
gasp. First he seemed to tie himself into
knots, pressing the ball into the pit of his stomach
81
like a person in excruciating anguish. On the
swing back, he turned completely away from the
batter, facing second base for a moment, at the
same time poising himself on his right foot and
pointing his left foot toward the zenith. Then he
came forward and around, as if he would put the
sphere over with the speed of a cannon ball&#8211;and
handed up a little, slow bender.

But he need not have troubled himself to put a
curve on that first one, for Fred Hallett, leading off
for the Grays, stood quite still and stared like a
person hypnotized. The ball floated over, and the
umpire called a strike, which led Hallett to shake
himself and join in the laughter of the crowd.

&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
spluttered Wiley. &#8220;Was my speed too much for
you? Couldn&#8217;t you see it when it came across?
Shall I pitch you a slow one?&#8221;

Hallett shook his head, unable to reply.

&#8220;Oh, vurry, vurry well,&#8221; said the Marine Marvel.
&#8220;As you choose. I don&#8217;t want to be too hard
on you.&#8221; Then, after going through with a startling
variation of the former convulsions, he did
pitch a ball that was so speedy that the batsman
swung too slowly. And, a few minutes later, completing
the performance to his own satisfaction,
he struck Hallett out with a neat little drop. &#8220;I
preen myself,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I&#8217;m still there with
82
the huckleberries. As a pitcher of class, I&#8217;ve got
Matty and a few others backed up against the
ropes. Bring on your next victim.&#8221;

Charlie Watson found the burlesque so amusing
that he laughed all the way from the bench to the
plate. The eccentric pitcher looked at him sympathetically.

&#8220;When you get through shedding tears,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll pitch to you. I hate to see a strong
man weep.&#8221;

Then, without the slightest warning, using no
wind-up whatever, he snapped one straight over,
catching Watson unprepared. That sobered Watson
down considerably.

&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you feeling better,&#8221; declared
the manager of the Wind Jammers. &#8220;Now that
you&#8217;re quite prepared, I&#8217;ll give you something
easy.&#8221;

The slow one that he tossed up seemed to hang
in the air with the stitches showing. Watson hit
it and popped a little fly into Wiley&#8217;s hands, the
latter not being compelled to move out of his
tracks. He removed his cap and bowed his thanks.

Doc Tremain walked out seriously enough, apparently
not at all amused by the horseplay that
was taking place. With his hands on his hips,
Wiley stared hard at Tremain.

83&#8220;Here&#8217;s a jolly soul!&#8221; cried the pitcher. &#8220;He&#8217;s
simply laughing himself sick. I love to see a man
enjoy himself so diabolically.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, play ball!&#8221; the doctor retorted tartly.
&#8220;This crowd isn&#8217;t here to see monkeyshines.&#8221;

&#8220;Then they won&#8217;t look at you, my happy friend.
And that&#8217;s a dart of subtle repartee.&#8221;

Wiley&#8217;s remarkable wind-up and delivery did
not seem to bother Tremain, who viciously smashed
the first ball pitched to him. It was a savage line
drive slightly to the left of the slabman, but the
latter shot out his gloved hand with the swiftness
of a striking rattlesnake, and grabbed the whistling
sphere. Having made the catch, the Marine Marvel
tossed the ball carelessly to the ground and
sauntered toward the bench with an air of bored
lassitude. There was a ripple of applause.

&#8220;You got off easy that time, cap&#8217;n,&#8221; said Locke,
coming out. &#8220;When are you going to let us have
a crack at Jones?&#8221;

&#8220;A crack at him!&#8221; retorted Wiley. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
make me titter, Lefty! Your assemblage of would-bes
never could get anything remotely related to a
crack off Jones. However, when ongwee begins
to creep over me I&#8217;ll let him go in and polish you
off.&#8221;

&#8220;Colonel&#8221; Rickey, leading off for the Wind
84
Jammers in the second, hoisted an infield fly, and
expressed his annoyance in a choice Southern
drawl as he went back to the bench.

Peter Plum, the fat right fielder, followed, poling
out an infield drive which, to the amazement of
the crowd, he nearly turned into a safety by the
most surprising dash to first. Impossible though
it seemed, the chunky, short-legged fellow could
run like a deer, and when he was cut down by little
more than a yard at the hassock he vehemently
protested that it was robbery.

Locke was taking it easy now; he almost seemed
to invite a situation that would again put his arm
to the test. There was a queer feeling in his shoulder,
a feeling he did not like, and he wondered if
he could &#8220;tighten&#8221; in repeated pinches, as he had
so frequently done when facing the best batters
in the business. But, though he grooved one to
Schaeffer, the catcher boosted an easy fly to Watson
in left field.

Wiley went through the second inning unharmed,
although, with two down, Colby landed on the
horsehide for two sacks. Coming next, Gates bit
at a slow one and lifted a foul to the third baseman.

&#8220;Now give me my faithful bludgeon,&#8221; cried the
Marine Marvel, making for the bats. &#8220;Watch me
start something! I&#8217;m going to lacerate the feelings
85
of this man Lefty. I hate to do it, but I hear
the clarion call of duty.&#8221;

Locke decided to strike Wiley out. Wiley picked
out a smoking shoot, and banged it on a line for one
sack.

&#8220;Nice tidy little bingle, wasn&#8217;t it, mate?&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;I fancied mayhap Dame Rumor had slandered
you, but alas! I fear me you are easy for a
real batter with an eye.&#8221;

Nuccio was up again, and he also hit safely,
Wiley going to third on the drive. Locke&#8217;s teeth
clicked together. Was it possible that real batters
could find him with such ease? If so, the Big
League would see him no more; he would not return
to it. If so, his days as a pitcher were surely
ended. For a moment Bailey Weegman&#8217;s grinning
face again rose vaguely before him.

&#8220;I must know!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I must settle
these infernal doubts that are torturing me.&#8221;


86CHAPTER XTHE ONLY DOOR

Luther Bemis blundered. He had been
given the signal to let Nuccio steal, but he
hit at the ball and raised a foul to Colby,
who stepped back upon first and completed a
double play unassisted, the Italian having made a
break for second. Nuccio was disgusted, and
Cap&#8217;n Wiley made a few remarks to Bemis that
caused the lengthy center fielder to retire to the
bench in confusion.

&#8220;There has been a sudden addition to the bone
crop,&#8221; concluded the vexed manager of the Wind
Jammers. &#8220;Beamy, in order to avoid getting
your dates mixed, you should carry a telescope
and take an occasional survey of the earth&#8217;s surface.&#8221;

&#8220;Niver mind, cap&#8217;n,&#8221; called O&#8217;Reilley. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
put ye across whin I hit.&#8221;

With a twinge of apprehension, Locke sought
to trick the confident Irishman into biting at a
curve. And, even as he pitched, he was annoyed
with himself because apprehension prevented
87
him from bending the ball over. O&#8217;Reilley stubbornly
declined to bite.

There was a sudden chorus of warning shouts
as Sommers returned the ball, and the pitcher was
surprised to see Cap&#8217;n Wiley running for the registry
station. The foxy old veteran was actually
trying to steal home on the Big League pitcher.
Laughing, Lefty waited for the ball, aware that
Sommers was leaping into position to nail the
runner. Without undue haste, yet without wasting
a second, the slabman snapped the sphere back
to the eager hands of the catcher, who poked it into
the sliding man&#8217;s ribs. Wiley was out by four
feet, at least.

&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you wait for O&#8217;Reilley to hit?&#8221;
Locke asked.

&#8220;I wanted to spare your already tattered
nerves,&#8221; was the instant answer. &#8220;You see, sympathy
may be found elsewhere than in the dictionary.&#8221;

Still floundering in the bog of doubt, Lefty was
far from satisfied. He had told himself that he invited
the test which would give him the answer he
sought, yet he realized that, face to face with it,
he had felt a shrinking, a qualm, akin to actual
dread; and he was angry with himself because he
drew a breath of relief when the blundering and
reckless playing of the Wind Jammers postponed
88
the ordeal, leaving him still groping in the
dark.

Sommers led off with a hot grounder, which
O&#8217;Reilley booted. Playing the game, Locke
bunted, advancing Sommers and perishing himself
at first.

&#8220;Cleverly done,&#8221; admitted Cap&#8217;n Wiley, &#8220;but
it will avail you naught. I shall now proceed to
decorate the pill with the oil of elusion.&#8221;

A friend called to Lefty in the crowd back of
first, and the pitcher walked back to exchange a
few words with him. He was turning away when a
hand fell on his arm, and he looked round to find
Weegman there. The man&#8217;s face wore a supercilious
and knowing smile.

&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to attend this game,&#8221; said Weegman,
&#8220;but, having the time, I decided to watch
part of it, as it would give me a good chance to
settle a certain point definitely in my mind. What
I&#8217;ve seen has been quite enough. Your arm is
gone, Locke, and you know it. You&#8217;re laboring
like a longshoreman against this bunch of bushers,
and, working hard as you are, you couldn&#8217;t hold
them only for their dub playing. I admit that
you struck out some of their weakest stickers, but
you were forced to the limit to do it, and it made
that injured wing of yours wilt. They had you
89
going in the last round, and threw away their
chance by bonehead playing.&#8221;

&#8220;Weegman,&#8221; said Locke, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of hearing
you talk. The sound of your voice makes me
weary.&#8221;

But instead of being disturbed the man chuckled.
&#8220;The truth frequently is unpleasant,&#8221; he returned;
&#8220;and you know I am speaking the raw
truth. Now I like you, Locke; I&#8217;ve always liked
you, and I hate to see you go down and out for
good. That&#8217;s what it means if you don&#8217;t accept
my offer. As manager of the Blue Stockings, you
can hold your job this season if you don&#8217;t pitch a
ball; it&#8217;ll enable you to stay in the business in a
new capacity, and you&#8217;ll not be dependent on your
arm. A pitcher&#8217;s arm may fail him any time. As
a manager, you may last indefinitely.&#8221;

&#8220;It would be a crime if the sort of a manager
you want lasted a month.&#8221;

&#8220;If you don&#8217;t come at my terms, you may kiss
yourself good-by. The Feds are going to learn
that your flinger is gone; be sure of that.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s a threat?&#8221;

&#8220;A warning. If their crazy offer has tempted
you, put the temptation aside. That offer will be
withdrawn. Every manager and magnate in the
business is going to know that as a pitcher you
90
have checked in. There&#8217;s only one door for you
to return by, and I&#8217;m holding it open.&#8221; He
laughed and placed his hand again ingratiatingly
upon Locke&#8217;s arm.

Locke shook it off instantly. &#8220;Were I as big a
rascal as you, Weegman,&#8221; he said, with limitless
contempt, &#8220;I&#8217;d make a dash through that door.
Thank Heaven, I&#8217;m not!&#8221;

The baffled man snapped his fingers. &#8220;You are
using language you&#8217;ll regret!&#8221; he harshly declared,
although he maintained his smiling demeanor
to such a degree that any one a few yards
distant might have fancied the conversation between
the two was of the pleasantest sort.

Lefty returned to the coaching line, taking the
place of Tremain; for Wiley had issued a pass to
Hallett, Watson was at bat, and the doctor followed
Watson. Instantly sizing up the situation,
the southpaw signaled for a double steal, and both
runners started with the first movement of the
pitcher&#8217;s delivery. Schaeffer&#8217;s throw to third was
not good, and Sommers slid under. Hallett had
no trouble about reaching second.

&#8220;What are you trying to pull off here?&#8221; cried
the manager of the Wind Jammers. &#8220;Such behavior
is most inconsiderate, or words to that effect.
However it simply makes it necessary for
me to inject a few more kinks into the horsehide.&#8221;

91Admittedly he did hand up some peculiar curves
to Watson, but his control was so poor that none
of the twisters came over and like Hallett, the
left fielder walked. This peopled the corners.

&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Wiley, still chipper and undisturbed,
&#8220;is that jolly soul who obligingly batted an
easy one into my fin the last time. I passed the
last hitter in order to get at this kind party
again.&#8221;

Tremain let one pitch go by, but the next one
pleased him, and he cracked the ball on the nose.
It was a two-base drive, which enabled the runners
already on to score. As the three raced over the
plate, one after another, Wiley was seen violently
wigwagging toward the bench. In response to
his signal, Mysterious Jones rose promptly and
prepared to warm up with the second catcher.

&#8220;I&#8217;m off to-day; perhaps I should say I&#8217;m awful,&#8221;
admitted the Marine Marvel. &#8220;A spazoozum
like that is sufficient to open my eyes to the
humiliating fact that I&#8217;m not pitching up to class.
In a few minutes, however, you&#8217;ll have an opportunity
to see Mr. Jones uncork some of the real
stuff.&#8221;

Wiley dallied with the next batter for the purpose
of giving the dummy pitcher time to shake
the kinks out of his arm. Apparently Jones did
not need much time in which to get ready, for
92
when the sailor presently dealt out another pass
the relief twirler signified his willingness to assume
the burden.

As Jones walked out upon the diamond, Locke
looked around vainly for Weegman. It was possible,
of course, that Collier&#8217;s private secretary
had departed at once following his last rebuff,
but somehow Lefty felt that he was still lingering
and taking pains not to be seen by Mysterious
Jones. Suddenly the southpaw felt a desire to
bring the two men face to face, wondering what
would happen. There was more than a possibility
that such a meeting might present some dramatic
features.

Turning back, Lefty&#8217;s eyes followed Jones.
The interest and fascination he had felt at first
sight of the man returned, taking hold upon him
powerfully and intensely. There was something
in the solemn face of the mute that spoke of shattered
hopes, deep and abiding sorrow, despair,
tragedy. He was like one who stood aloof even
while he mingled with mankind. Knowing other
mutes, many of whom seemed happy and contented,
Locke could not believe that the peculiarities
of Mysterious Jones were wholly due to resentment
against the affliction which fate had
placed upon him. Behind it all there must lay a
story with perhaps more than one dark page.


93CHAPTER XIBURNING SPEED

As a pitcher, Jones displayed no needless
flourishes. His style of delivery was
simple but effective. Into the swing of
his long arm he put the throwing force of his fine
shoulder and sinewy body. Wiley had exaggerated
in boasting of the mute&#8217;s speed; nevertheless
that speed was something to marvel at. Norris,
the clean-up man of the Grays, who preferred
smokers to any other kind, was too slow in striking
at the first two pitched to him by Jones. Norris
looked astounded and incredulous, and the
spectators gasped.

&#8220;That&#8217;s his slow one, mates!&#8221; cried Wiley.
&#8220;Pretty soon, when he gets loosened up, he&#8217;ll let
out a link or two and burn a few across. The
daisies are growing above the only man he ever hit
with the ball.&#8221;

Although Norris was not slow in swinging at
the next one, the sphere took a shoot that deceived
him, and the mute had disposed of the first hitter
with three pitched balls.

94&#8220;And the wiseacres say there are no real heavers
left in the bushes!&#8221; whooped Cap&#8217;n Wiley.

Locke was thrilled. Could it be that here was
a discovery, a find, a treasure like a diamond in
the rough, left around underfoot amid pebbles?
The Big League scouts are the grubstakers, the
prospectors, the treasure hunters of baseball;
ceaselessly and tirelessly they scour the country
even to the remote corners and out-of-the-way regions
where the game nourishes in the crude, lured
on constantly by the hope of making a big find.
To them the unearthing of a ball player of real
ability and promise is like striking the outcroppings
of a Comstock or a Kimberly; and among
the cheering surface leads that they discover, a
hundred peter out into worthlessness, where one
develops into a property of value. More and
more the scouts complain that the ground has been
raked over again and again and the prizes are
growing fewer and farther between; yet every
now and then, where least expected, one of
them will turn up something rich that has been
overlooked by journeying too far afield. The
fancy that Mysterious Jones might be one of these
unnoticed nuggets set Locke&#8217;s pulses throbbing.

Jones had appeared to be a trifle slender in
street clothes, but now Lefty could see that he
95
was the possessor of fine muscles and whipcord
sinews. There was no ounce of unnecessary flesh
upon him anywhere; he was like an athlete trained
to the minute and hardened for an enduring test
by long and continuous work. There seemed little
likelihood that protracted strain would expose a
flaw. He had speed and stamina; if he possessed
the required skill and brains, there was every reason
to think that he might &#8220;deliver the goods.&#8221;
With the advent of the silent man upon the mound,
Locke&#8217;s attention became divided between doubts
about himself and interest in the performance of
the mute.

Hampton, who followed Norris, was quite as
helpless against the dazzling speed of Jones; he
could not even foul the ball. &#8220;Great smoke,
Locke!&#8221; he exclaimed, pausing on his way to center
field. &#8220;That man&#8217;s a terror! He seems to
groove them all, but you can&#8217;t see them come
over.&#8221;

&#8220;Perhaps he can&#8217;t keep it up,&#8221; said Lefty.

&#8220;I hope not. If he does, we&#8217;ve got to win on
the runs we&#8217;ve made already; there&#8217;ll be no more
scoring for us. It&#8217;s up to you to hold them
down.&#8221;

The southpaw held them in the fourth, but he
did so by working his head fully as much as his
arm. By this time he had learned something of
96
the hitting weaknesses of the Wind Jammers, and
he played upon those weaknesses successfully. To
his teammates and the spectators the performance
was satisfactory; to him it proved only that his
brain, if not his arm, was still in perfect condition.

Mysterious Jones came back with two strikeouts;
in fact, he struck Sommers, the third man,
out also; but the whistling, shooting sphere went
through the catcher, and Sommers raced to first
on the error. This brought Locke up, and he was
eager to hit against Jones. He missed the first
one cleanly, but fouled the next two, which was
better than any one else had done. Then the silent
man put something more on the ball, and
Lefty failed to touch it.

&#8220;Nice little pitcher, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; inquired
Cap&#8217;n Wiley blandly.

&#8220;He behaves well, very well,&#8221; admitted the
southpaw.

The Grays implored Locke to keep the enemy in
hand; the crowd entreated him. This was the
game they desired to win. To them it was a struggle
of vital importance, and the winning or losing
of it was the only question of moment. They did
not dream of something a thousand times more
momentous involving Lefty Locke.

Loyal to the team and its supporters, the southpaw
97
could not take needless chances of losing, no
matter how much he longed to be put upon his
mettle and forced to the last notch. Therefore
he continued to work his head while on the slab.
Schaeffer fouled out, Jones fanned indifferently,
and Nuccio popped to shortstop.

&#8220;Lucky boy!&#8221; called Wiley. &#8220;But things
won&#8217;t always break so well for you. You&#8217;ll have
to go your limit before the game is over.&#8221;

&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Lefty.

Hallett caught one of Jones&#8217; whistlers on the
end of his bat and drove it straight into the hands
of the first baseman.

&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; laughed Watson. &#8220;At least that
shows that he can be hit.&#8221;

&#8220;A blind man might hit one in a million if he
kept his bat swinging,&#8221; scoffed Wiley. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
see you do as much.&#8221;

Watson could not do as much; he fanned three
times. Then Jones pitched four balls to Tremain,
and the doctor placed himself in Watson&#8217;s class.

The game had become a pitchers&#8217; battle, with
one twirler cutting the batters down with burning
speed and shoots, while the other held them in
check through the knowledge he had swiftly acquired
regarding their shortcomings with the
stick. In every way the performance of Jones
was the most spectacular, and in the crowd scores
98
of persons were beginning to tell one another that
the mute was the greater pitcher.

The truth was, experience in fast company had
taught Lefty Locke to conserve his energies; like
Mathewson, he believed that the eight players who
supported him should shoulder a share of the defensive
work, and it was not his practice to &#8220;put
everything on the ball,&#8221; with the cushions clean.
Only when pinches came did he tighten and burn
them across. Nor was he in that class of pitchers
who are continually getting themselves into holes
by warping them wide to lure batters into reaching;
for he had found that a twirler who followed
such a method would be forced to go the limit by
cool and heady batters who made a practice of
&#8220;waiting it out.&#8221; Having that prime requisite of
all first-class moundmen, splendid control, he
sought out an opponent&#8217;s weakest spot and kept
the ball there, compelling the man to strike at the
kind from which he was least likely to secure effective
drives. This had led a large number of
the fans who fancied themselves wise to hold fast
to their often-expressed belief that the southpaw
was lucky, but they were always looking for the
opposition to fall on him and hammer him all over
the lot.

Therefore it was not strange that the crowd, assembled
to watch the game in Fernandon, should
99
soon come to regard the mute, with his blinding
speed and jagged shoots, as the superior slabman.
Apparently without striving for effect, Jones was
a spectacular performer; mechanical skill and
superabundant energy were his to the limit. But
Locke knew that something more was needed for
a man to make good in the Big League. Nevertheless,
with such a foundation to build upon, unless
the fellow should be flawed by some overshadowing
natural weakness that made him impossible,
coaching, training, and experience were the rungs
of the ladder by which he might mount close to the
top.

Loyal to the core, Lefty was thinking of the
pitching staff of the Blue Stockings, weakened by
deflections to the Federals, possibly by his own inability
to return. For a little time, even Weegman
was forgotten. Anyway, the southpaw had
not yet come to regard it as a settled thing that
Bailey Weegman would be permitted to undermine
and destroy the great organization, if such was
his culpable design; in some manner the scoundrel
would be blocked and baffled.

The sixth inning saw no break in the run of the
game between the Grays and the Wind Jammers.
Bemis, O&#8217;Reilley, and Schepps all hit Locke, but
none hit safely, while Jones slaughtered three of
the locals by the strike-out method. As Wiley had
100
stated was the silent man&#8217;s custom, he seemed to
be seeking revenge on the world for giving him a
raw deal.

When Oleson began the seventh with a weak
grounder and &#8220;got a life&#8221; through an error, Lefty
actually felt a throb of satisfaction, for it seemed
that the test might be forced upon him at last.
But the Swede attempted to steal on the first pitch
to Rickey, and Sommers threw him out. Rickey
then lifted a high fly just back of first base, and
Colby put him out of his misery. Plum batted
an easy one to second.

&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing for me to do,&#8221; thought
Locke. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to work the strike-out stuff in
the next two innings, just as if men were on bases,
and see if I&#8217;ve got it. The game will be over
if I wait any longer for a real pinch.&#8221;

When Jones had polished off Gates and Sommers,
Locke stepped out to face the mute the second
time. Having watched the man and analyzed
his performance, the southpaw felt that he should
be able to obtain a hit. &#8220;If I can&#8217;t lay the club
against that ball,&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;then that fellow&#8217;s
putting something on it beside speed and
curves; he&#8217;s using brains also.&#8221;

Cap&#8217;n Wiley jumped up from the bench and did
a sailor&#8217;s hornpipe. &#8220;This is the life!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;The real thing against the real thing! Take
101
soundings, Lefty; you&#8217;re running on shoals.
You&#8217;ll be high and dry in a minute.&#8221;

Straight and silent, Jones stood and looked at
the Big League player, both hands holding the ball
hidden before him. Wiley ceased his dancing and
shouting and a hush settled on the crowd. To
Locke it seemed that the eyes of the voiceless
pitcher were plumbing the depths of his mind and
searching out his hidden thoughts; there came to
Lefty a ridiculous fancy that by some telepathic
method the man on the slab could fathom his purposes
and so make ready to defeat them. An uncanny
feeling crept upon him, and he was annoyed.
Jones pitched, and the batsman missed a marvelous
drop, which he had not been expecting.

&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;ll have to revise my theory about
him not using brains,&#8221; was the southpaw&#8217;s mental
admission.

The next two pitches were both a trifle wide, and
Lefty declined to bite at either. For the first time,
as if he knew that here was a test, Jones appeared
to be trying to &#8220;work&#8221; the batter. Locke fouled
the following one.

&#8220;That&#8217;s all there is to it,&#8221; declared Wiley,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m excruciatingly surprised that there
should be even that much. Go &#8217;way back, Mr.
Locke!&#8221;

Again Jones surveyed Lefty with his piercing
102
eyes, and for the third time he pitched a shoot that
was not quite across. As if he had known it would
not be over, the batsman made not even the slightest
move to swing.

&#8220;Some guessing match!&#8221; confessed the Marine
Marvel. &#8220;Now, however, let me give you my
plighted word of dishonor that you&#8217;re going to behold
a specimen of the superfluous speed Jonesy
keeps on tap for special occasions. Hold your
breath and see if you can see it go by.&#8221;

The ball did not go by; Lefty hit it fairly and
sent a safety humming to right.


103CHAPTER XIITOO MUCH TEMPTATION

&#8220;Is it poss-i-bill!&#8221; gasped Cap&#8217;n Wiley, staggering
and clutching at his forehead. &#8220;I
am menaced by a swoon! Water! Whisky!
I&#8217;ll accept anything to revive me!&#8221;

Fred Hallett hurried to the pan with his bat.
&#8220;It&#8217;s my turn now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve started on
him, and we should all hit him.&#8221;

Locke signalled that he would steal, and Hallett
let the first one pass. Lefty went down the
line like a streak, but Schaeffer made a throw that
forced him to hit the dirt and make a hook slide.
He caught his spikes in the bag and gave his ankle
a twist that sent a pain shooting up his leg.

&#8220;Safe!&#8221; declared the umpire.

Locke did not get up. The crowd saw him drag
himself to the bag and sit on it, rubbing his ankle.
Schepps bent over him solicitously.

&#8220;Dat was a nice little crack, pal,&#8221; said the sandlotter,
&#8220;and a nifty steal. Hope youse ain&#8217;t
hoited.&#8221;

But Lefty had sprained his ankle so seriously
that he required assistance to walk from the field.
104
A runner was put in his place, although Wiley informed
them that they need not take the trouble.
And Wiley was right, for Jones struck Hallett out.

It was impossible for Locke to continue pitching,
so Matthews took his place. And the southpaw
was left still uncertain and doubtful; the game had
not provided the test he courted. Weegman apparently
had departed; there was no question in
the mind of Charles Collier&#8217;s representative, and,
angered by the rebuff he had encountered, he was
pretty certain to spread the report that the great
southpaw was &#8220;all in.&#8221; He had practically
threatened to do this when he declared that every
manager and magnate in the business would soon
know that Locke&#8217;s pitching days were over.

The Wind Jammers, spurred on by Cap&#8217;n
Wiley, went after Matthews aggressively, and for
a time it appeared certain that they were going
to worry him off his feet. With only one down,
they pushed a runner across in the eighth, and
there were two men on the sacks when a double
play blighted their prospect of tying up, perhaps
of taking the lead, at once.

As Jones continued invulnerable in the last of
the eighth, the visitors made their final assault
upon Matthews in the ninth. But fortune was
against them. The game ended with Wiley greatly
disappointed, though still cheerful.

105&#8220;A little frost crept into my elbow in the far-away
regions of the North,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
shake it out in time. If I&#8217;d started old Jonesy
against Lefty, there would have been a different
tale to tell.&#8221;

The Wind Jammers were booked to play in
Jacksonville the following afternoon, but they remained
in Fernandon overnight. Seated on the
veranda of the Magnolia, Wiley was enjoying a
cigar after the evening meal, and romancing, as
usual, when Locke appeared, limping, with the aid
of a cane.

&#8220;It grieves me to behold your sorry plight,&#8221;
said the Marine Marvel sympathetically. &#8220;I cajole
with you most deprecatingly. But why, if
you were going to get hurt at all, weren&#8217;t you
obliging enough to do it somewhat earlier in the
pastime? That would have given my faithful
henchmen a chance to put the game away on ice.&#8221;

&#8220;You can&#8217;t be sure about that,&#8221; returned
Lefty. &#8220;You collected no more scores off Matthews
than you did off me.&#8221;

&#8220;But you passed us six nice, ripe goose eggs,
while he dealt out only one. There was a difference
that could be distinguished with the unclothed
optic. Nevertheless, it seems to me that Jones
had something on you; while he officiated, you
were the only person who did any gamboling on
106
the cushions, and what you did didn&#8217;t infect the
result. What do you think of Jones?&#8221;

&#8220;Will you lend me your ear while I express my
opinion privately?&#8221;

&#8220;With the utmost perspicacity,&#8221; said Wiley,
rising. &#8220;Within my boudoir&#8211;excuse my fluid
French&#8211;I&#8217;ll uncork either ear you prefer and let
you pour it full to overflowing.&#8221;

In the privacy of Wiley&#8217;s room, without beating
around the bush, Locke stated that he believed
Jones promising material for the Big League, and
that he wished to size up the man.

&#8220;While I have no scouting commission or authority,&#8221;
said Lefty, &#8220;if Kennedy should manage
the Blue Stockings this season, he&#8217;d stand by my
judgment. The team must have pitchers. Of
course, some will be bought in the regular manner,
but I know that, on my advice, Kennedy would
take Jones on and give him a show to make good,
just as he gave me a chance when I was a busher.
I did not climb up by way of the minors; I made
one clean jump from the back pastures into the Big
League.&#8221;

&#8220;Mate,&#8221; said Wiley, &#8220;let me tell you something
a trifle bazaar: Jones hasn&#8217;t the remotest ambition
in the world to become a baseball pitcher.&#8221;

Locke stared at him incredulously. The
107
swarthy little man was serious&#8211;at least, as serious
as he could be.

&#8220;Then,&#8221; asked the southpaw, &#8220;why is he pitching?&#8221;

&#8220;Tell me! I&#8217;ve done a little prognosticating
over that question.&#8221;

&#8220;You say he does not talk about himself. How
do you&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Let me elucidate, if I can. I told you I ran
across Jones in Alaska. I saw him pitch in a baseball
match in Nome. How he came to ingratiate
himself into that contest I am unable to state.
Nobody seemed able to tell me. All I found out
about him was that he was one of three partners
who had a valuable property somewhere up in the
Jade Mountain region&#8211;not a prospect, but a real,
bony-fido mine. Already they had received offers
for the property, and any day they could sell out
for a sum salubrious enough to make them all scandalously
wealthy. They had entered into some
sort of an agreement that bound them all to hold
on until two of the three should vote to sell; Jones
was tied up under this contraction.

&#8220;I had grown weary of the vain search for the
root of all evil. For me that root has always been
more slippery than a squirming eel; every time I
thought I had it by the tail it would wriggle out of
108
my eager clutch and get away. I longed for the
fleshpots of my own native heath. Watching that
ball game in Nome, my blood churned in my veins
until it nearly turned to butter. Once more, in my
well-fertilized fancy, I saw myself towering the
country with my Wind Jammers; and, could I secure
Jonesy for my star flinger, I knew I would be
able to make my return engagement a scintillating
and scandalous success. With him for a nucleus,
I felt confident that I could assemble together a
bunch of world beaters. I resolved to go after
Jones. I went, without dalliance. I got him corralled
in a private room and locked the door on
him.

&#8220;Mate, I am a plain and simple soul, given not
a jot or tittle to exaggeration, yet I am ready to
affirm&#8211;I never swear; it&#8217;s profane&#8211;that I had
the tussle of my life with Jones. Parenthetically
speaking, we wrestled all over that room for about
five solid hours. I had supplied myself with forty
reams of writing paper, a bushel basket full of lead
pencils, and two dictionaries. When I finally subdued
Jones, I was using a stub of the last pencil
in the basket, was on the concluding sheet of
paper, had contracted writer&#8217;s cramp, and the dictionaries
were mere torn and tattered wrecks.
In the course of that argument, I am certain I
wrote every word in the English language, besides
109
coining a few thousand of my own. I had practically
exhausted every form of persuasion, and
was on the verge of lying down and taking the
count. Then, by the rarest chance, I hit upon the
right thing. I wrote a paregoric upon the joys of
traveling around over the United States from city
to city, from town to town, of visiting every place
of importance in the whole broad land, of meeting
practically every living human being in the
country who was alive and deserved to be met.
Somehow that got him; I don&#8217;t know why, but it
did. I saw his eyes gleam and his somber face
change as he read that last wild stab of mine. It
struck home; he agreed to go. I had conquered.

&#8220;Now, mark ye well, the amount of his salary
had not a whit to do with it, and he entertained
absolutely no ambish to become a baseball pitcher.
He was compelled to leave his partners up there
running the mine, and to rely upon their honesty
to give him a square deal. You have been told
how he promulgates around over every new place
he visits and stares strangers out of countenance.
Whether or not he&#8217;s otherwise wrong in his garret,
he&#8217;s certainly &#8216;off&#8217; on that stunt. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;m
able to keep him on the parole of this club of
mine.&#8221;

&#8220;In short, he&#8217;s a sort of monomaniac?&#8221;

&#8220;Perhaps that&#8217;s it.&#8221;

110Lefty did a bit of thinking. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been touring
the smaller cities and the towns in which an independent
ball team would be most likely to draw.
In the large cities of a Big League circuit there are
thousands upon thousands of persons Jones has
never met. He could work a whole season in such
a circuit and continue to see hosts of strangers
every time he visited any one of the cities included.
Under such circumstances he would have the same
incentive that he has now. If he can be induced
to make the change, I&#8217;ll take a chance on him, and
I&#8217;ll see that you are well paid to use your persuasive
powers to lead him to accept my proposition.&#8221;

&#8220;But you stated that you had no legal authority
to make such a deal.&#8221;

&#8220;I haven&#8217;t; but I am willing to take a chance,
with the understanding that the matter is to be
kept quiet until I shall be able to put through an
arrangement that will make it impossible for any
manager in organized ball to steal him away.&#8221;

Wiley shook his head. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get along
without him, Lefty; he&#8217;s the mainsheet of the
Wind Jammers. It would be like chucking the
sextant and the compass overboard. We&#8217;d be
adrift without any instrument to give us our position
or anything to lay a course by.&#8221;

111&#8220;If you don&#8217;t sell him to me, some manager is
going to take him from you without handing you
as much as a lonesome dollar in return. You can&#8217;t
dodge the Big League scouts; it&#8217;s a wonder you&#8217;ve
dodged them as long as you have. They&#8217;re bound
to spot Jones and gobble him up. Do you prefer
to sell him or to have him snatched?&#8221;

&#8220;What will you give for him?&#8221;

&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking business. If I can put
through the deal I&#8217;m figuring on, I&#8217;ll give you five
hundred dollars, which, considering the conditions,
is more than a generous price.&#8221;

&#8220;Five hundred dollars! Is there that much
money to be found in one lump anywhere in the
world?&#8221;

&#8220;I own some Blue Stockings stock, so you see I
have a financial, as well as a sentimental, interest
in the club. I&#8217;m going to fight hard to prevent it
from being wrecked. As long as it can stay in the
first division it will continue to be a money-maker,
but already the impression has become current
that the team is riddled, and the stock has
slumped. There are evil forces at work. I don&#8217;t
know the exact purpose these forces are aiming at,
but I&#8217;m a pretty good guesser. The property is
mighty valuable for some people to get hold of if
they can get it cheap enough.&#8221;

112&#8220;They&#8217;re even saying that you&#8217;re extremely to
the bad. What do you think about it yourself,
Lefty?&#8221;

Locke flushed. &#8220;Time will answer that.&#8221;

&#8220;You look like a fighter,&#8221; said Wiley. &#8220;I wish
you luck.&#8221;

&#8220;But what do you say to my proposition? Give
me a flat answer.&#8221;

&#8220;Five hundred dollars!&#8221; murmured the Marine
Marvel, licking his lips. &#8220;I&#8217;m wabbling on
the top rail of the fence.&#8221;

&#8220;Fall one way or the other.&#8221;

Heaving a sigh, the sailor rose to his feet, and
gave his trousers a hitch. &#8220;Let&#8217;s interview
Jones,&#8221; he proposed.


113CHAPTER XIIITHE PERPLEXING QUESTION

The following morning Lefty Locke received
two letters. One was from the Federal
League headquarters in Chicago, urging
him to accept the offer of the manager who had
made such a tempting proposal to him. The position,
it stated, was still his for the taking, and
he was pressed to wire agreement to the terms
proposed.

The other letter was from Locke&#8217;s father, a
clergyman residing in a small New Jersey town.
The contents proved disturbing. The Reverend
Mr. Hazelton&#8217;s savings of a lifetime had been invested
in a building and loan association, and the
association had failed disastrously. Practically
everything the clergyman possessed in the world
would be swept away; it seemed likely that he
would lose his home.

Lefty&#8217;s face grew pale and grim as he read this
letter. He went directly to his wife and told her.
Janet was distressed.

&#8220;What can be done?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You must
do something, Lefty! Your father and mother,
114
at their age, turned out of their home! It is terrible!
What can you do?&#8221;

Locke considered a moment. &#8220;If I had not invested
the savings of my baseball career in Blue
Stockings stock,&#8221; he said regretfully, &#8220;I&#8217;d have
enough now to save their home for them.&#8221;

&#8220;But can&#8217;t you sell the stock?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, for half what I paid for it&#8211;perhaps.
That wouldn&#8217;t he enough. You&#8217;re right in saying
I must do something, but what can I&#8211;&#8221; He
stopped, staring at the other letter. He sat down,
still staring at it, and Janet came and put her arm
about him.

&#8220;Here&#8217;s something!&#8221; he exclaimed suddenly.

&#8220;What, dear?&#8221;

&#8220;This letter from Federal League headquarters,
urging me to grab the offer the Feds have made
me. Twenty-seven thousand dollars for three
years, a certified check for the first year&#8217;s salary,
and a thousand dollars bonus. That means that I
can get ten thousand right in my hand by signing
a Federal contract&#8211;more than enough to save my
folks.&#8221;

Janet&#8217;s face beamed, and she clapped her hands.
&#8220;I had forgotten about their offer! Why, you&#8217;re
all right! It&#8217;s just the thing.&#8221;

&#8220;I wonder?&#8221;

She looked at him, and grew sober. &#8220;Oh, you
115
don&#8217;t want to go to the Federals? You&#8217;re afraid
they won&#8217;t last?&#8221;

&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that.&#8221;

&#8220;No?&#8221;

&#8220;No, girl. If there was nothing else to restrain
me, I&#8217;d take the next train for Chicago, and put my
fist to a Fed contract just as soon as I could. I
need ten thousand dollars now, and need it more
than I ever before needed money.&#8221;

Janet ran her fingers through his hair, bending
forward to scan his serious and perplexed face.
She could see that he was fighting a battle silently,
grimly. She longed to aid him in solving the problem
by which he was confronted, but realizing that
she could not quite put herself in his place, and
that, therefore, her advice might not come from the
height of wisdom and experience, she held herself
in check. Should he ask counsel of her she
would give the best she could.

&#8220;I know,&#8221; she said, after a little period of silence,
&#8220;that you must think of your financial interest
in the Blue Stockings.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m not spending a moment&#8217;s thought on that
now. I&#8217;m thinking of old Jack Kennedy and
Charles Collier; of Bailey Weegman and his
treachery, for I believe he is treacherous to the
core. I&#8217;m thinking also of something else I don&#8217;t
like to think about.&#8221;

116&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she urged.

He looked up at her, and smiled wryly. Then
he felt of his left shoulder. &#8220;It&#8217;s this,&#8221; he said.

She caught her breath. &#8220;But you said you were
going to give your arm the real test yesterday.
The Grays won, and the score was three to one
when you hurt your ankle and were forced to quit.
I thought you were satisfied.&#8221;

&#8220;I very much doubt if the Grays would have
won had not Cap&#8217;n Wiley insisted upon pitching
the opening innings for his team. The man who
followed him did not permit us to score at all. I
was the only one who got a safe hit off him. The
test was not satisfactory, Janet.&#8221;

Her face grew white. It was not like Lefty to
lack confidence in himself. During the past
months, although his injured arm had seemed to
improve with disheartening slowness, he had insisted
that it would come round all right before the
season opened. Yet lately he had not appeared
quite so optimistic. And now, after the game
which was to settle his doubts, he seemed more
doubtful than before. She believed that he was
holding something back, that he was losing heart,
but as long as there was any hope remaining he
would try not to burden her with his worries.

Suddenly she clutched his shoulders with her
slender hands. &#8220;It&#8217;s all wrong!&#8221; she cried.
117
&#8220;You&#8217;ve given up the best that was in you for the
Blue Stockings. You&#8217;ve done the work of two
pitchers. They won&#8217;t let you go now. Even if
your arm is bad at the beginning of the season,
they&#8217;ll keep you on and give you a chance to get
it back into condition.&#8221;

&#8220;Old Jack Kennedy would, but I have my doubts
about any other manager.&#8221;

&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;d let you go outright,
just drop you?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s possible they&#8217;d try to sell me or trade
me. If they could work me off on to some one who
wasn&#8217;t wise, probably they&#8217;d do it. That&#8217;s not
reckoning on Weegman. He&#8217;s so sore and vindictive
that he may spread the report that I&#8217;ve
pitched my wing off. I fancy he wouldn&#8217;t care a
rap if that did lose Collier the selling price that
could be got for me.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, I just hate to hear you talk about being
traded or sold! It doesn&#8217;t sound as if you were
a human being and this a free country. Cattle are
traded and sold.&#8221;

&#8220;Cattle and ball players.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s wrong! Isn&#8217;t there any way&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;The Federals are showing the way.&#8221;

&#8220;Your sympathy&#8217;s with them. You&#8217;re not
bound to the Blue Stockings; you&#8217;re still your own
free agent.&#8221;

118&#8220;Under the circumstances what would you have
me do?&#8221;

At last he had asked her advice. Now she could
speak. She did so eagerly.

&#8220;Accept the offer the Federals have made you.&#8221;

&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;would you have me do
that, with my own mind in doubt as to whether or
not I was worth a dollar to them? Would you
have me take the ten thousand I could get, knowing
all the time that they might be paying it for
a has-been who wasn&#8217;t worth ten cents? Would
that be honest?&#8221;

&#8220;You can be honest, then,&#8221; she hurriedly declared.
&#8220;No one knows for a certainty, not even
yourself, that you can&#8217;t come back to your old
form. You can go to the manager and tell him
the truth about yourself. Can&#8217;t you do that?&#8221;

&#8220;And then what? Probably he wouldn&#8217;t want
me after that at any price.&#8221;

&#8220;You can make a fair bargain with him. You
can have it put in the contract that you are to get
that money if you do come back and make good
as a pitcher.&#8221;

Lefty laughed. &#8220;I think it would be the first
time on record that a ball player ever went to a
manager who was eager to sign him up, and made
such a proposition. It would be honest, Janet;
but if the manager believed me, if he saw I was
119
serious, do you fancy he&#8217;d feel like coming across
with the first year&#8217;s salary in advance and the
bonus? You see I can&#8217;t raise the money I need,
and be honest.&#8221;

She wrung her hands and came back to the first
question that had leaped from her lips: &#8220;What
can you do?&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll make any decisive move until
I find out what sort of queer business is going on
in the Blue Stockings camp. I could get money
through Kennedy if he were coming back. Everything
is up in the air.&#8221;

&#8220;How can you find out, away down here?
You&#8217;re too far away from the places where things
are doing.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking for a telegram from old Jack,
an answer to mine. I feel confident I&#8217;ll get a wire
from him as soon as he reads my letter. Meanwhile
I&#8217;ll write to my parents and try to cheer
them up. It&#8217;s bound to take a little time to settle
up the affairs of that building and loan association.
Time is what I need now.&#8221;

That very day Locke received a telegram from
Jack Kennedy:


Meet me at the Grand, Indianapolis, the twenty-third.
Don&#8217;t fail.
 

A train carried Lefty north that night.


120CHAPTER XIVONLY ONE WAY

The registry clerk stated that no Mr. Kennedy
was stopping at the Grand Hotel.
Locke was disappointed, for he had expected
old Jack would be waiting for him. However,
the veteran manager would, doubtless, appear
later. Lefty registered, and the clerk tossed
a room key to the boy who was waiting with the
southpaw&#8217;s traveling bag.

As the pitcher turned from the desk he found
himself face to face with a man whom he had seen
on the train. The man, Locke believed, had come
aboard at Louisville. There was something familiar
about the appearance of the stranger, yet
Lefty had not been able to place him. He had narrow
hips, a rather small waist, fine chest development,
and splendid shoulders; his neck was broad
and swelling at the base; his head, with the hair
clipped close, was round as a bullet; his nose had
been broken, and there was an ugly scar upon his
right cheek. He did not look to be at all fat, and
yet he must have weighed close to one hundred and
121
ninety. His hands, clenched, would have resembled
miniature battering-rams.

This person had not taken a look at the register,
yet he addressed the pitcher by name.

&#8220;How are you, Locke?&#8221; he said, with a grin that
was half a sneer, half a menace. &#8220;I guessed you&#8217;d
bring up here.&#8221;

Lefty knew Mit Skullen the moment he spoke.
One-time prize fighter and ball player, Skullen
now posed as a scout employed by the Rockets;
more often he acted as the henchman and bodyguard
of Tom Garrity, owner of the team, and the
best-hated man in the business. Garrity had so
many enemies that he could not keep track of
them; a dozen men had tried to &#8220;get&#8221; him at different
times, and twice he had been assaulted and
beaten up. Skullen had saved him from injury on
other occasions.

Garrity was the most sinister figure in organized
baseball. Once a newspaper reporter, he had
somehow obtained control of the Rockets by chicanery
and fraud. Sympathy and gratitude
were sentiments unknown to him. He would work
a winning pitcher to death, and then send the man
shooting down to the minors the moment he
showed the slightest symptom of weakness. He
scoffed at regulations and bylaws; he defied restraint
and control; he was in a constant wrangle
122
with other owners and managers; and as a creator
of discord and dissension he held the belt. And
he snapped his fingers in the face of the national
commission. The league longed to get rid of him,
but could not seem to find any method of doing
so.

&#8220;Been lookin&#8217; &#8217;em over a little down South,&#8221;
explained Skullen superfluously. &#8220;Not much
doin&#8217; this season, but I spotted one pitcher with a
rovin&#8217; bunch o&#8217; freaks who had more smoke and
kinks than you ever showed before you broke your
arm, old boy. And he won&#8217;t cost a cent when we
get ready to grab him. Nobody&#8217;s wise to him but
me, either. S&#8217;pose you&#8217;ve come on to meet Weegman,
hey?&#8221;

&#8220;Where&#8217;d you run across this find?&#8221; asked
Locke casually, endeavoring not to appear curious.

Skullen pulled down one corner of his mouth,
and winked. &#8220;T&#8217;ink I&#8217;ll tell youse, old boy. But
then Texas is a big bunch o&#8217; the map.&#8221;

Texas! The Wind Jammers had come to Florida
from Galveston.

&#8220;Did you have a talk with this unknown wizard?&#8221;
questioned Lefty.

&#8220;He didn&#8217;t talk much,&#8221; returned the scout.
&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t pump me! I know your old Blue
Stocks ain&#8217;t got a pitcher left that&#8217;s worth a hoot
in Halifax, or hardly a player, for that matter;
123
but I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to help you out&#8211;you an&#8217; Weegman.
You gotter get together an&#8217; do your own
diggin&#8217;.&#8221;

&#8220;Weegman is in Indianapolis?&#8221;

&#8220;As if you didn&#8217;t know! Never had no use for
that guy; but, all the same, I advise you to grab
on with him. It&#8217;s your only chanct for a baseball
job; everybody in the game&#8217;s wise that you&#8217;ll
never do no more hurlin&#8217;.&#8221;

Boiling inwardly, Locke permitted himself to
be conducted to the elevator. While he was bathing
he thought, with increasing wrath and dismay,
of the insolent words of Skullen. The question
that perplexed him most was how the bruiser knew
anything of Weegman&#8217;s business, especially the attempt
to sign Locke as a manager. And Weegman
was in Indianapolis!

Coming down, Lefty went again to the desk to
inquire about Kennedy. He was handed a telegram.
Tearing it open, he saw that it was from
the Federal manager who had offered him a three
years&#8217; contract. It stated curtly that the offer
was withdrawn. Skullen was right; the story had
gone forth that the star southpaw of the Blue
Stockings would do no more pitching. Weegman
was getting in his fine work.

Lefty felt a hand grip his elbow.

&#8220;Locke!&#8221; A well-dressed, youngish man
124
grasped his hand and shook it. It was Franklin
Parlmee, who, for a long time, had evinced deep
interest in Virginia Collier. Parlmee, with family
behind him, and a moderate income, had shown
a distaste for business and a disposition to live the
life of an idler. Collier had refused to countenance
his daughter&#8217;s marriage to Parlmee until
the latter should get into some worthy and remunerative
employment, and make good. For two
years Parlmee had been hustling, and he had developed
into a really successful automobile salesman.

&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; said Parlmee. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect to
run across you here, old man. I&#8217;m mighty glad
to see you. Perhaps you can tell me something
about Virginia. What has Mrs. Hazelton heard
from her?&#8221;

The man seemed worried and nervous, and his
question surprised Lefty.

&#8220;If any one should know about Miss Collier,
you are the person,&#8221; returned the pitcher.
&#8220;Janet has scarcely heard from her since she
sailed with her father. We supposed you were
corresponding with her regularly.&#8221;

Parlmee drew him toward a leather-covered
settee. &#8220;I&#8217;m pegged out,&#8221; he admitted, and he
looked it. &#8220;Business forced me to run on or I&#8217;d
not be here now. I&#8217;m going back to New York to-night.
125
Do you know, I&#8217;ve received only two letters
from Virginia since she reached the other
side, one from London, the other from Eaux
Chaudes, in France. The latter was posted more
than a month ago. It stated that Virginia and
her father were leaving Eaux Chaudes for Italy.
Since then no letters have come from her.&#8221;

&#8220;Do you mean to say you haven&#8217;t an idea where
Miss Collier and her father are at the present
time?&#8221;

Parlmee lighted a cigarette. His hands were
not steady. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t an idea where Charles
Collier is. As for Virginia, she cabled me that
she was sailing on the Victoria, which reached
New York four days ago. I was at the pier to
meet her, but she didn&#8217;t arrive, and her name was
not on the passenger list.&#8221;

Lefty uttered an exclamation. &#8220;That was
strange!&#8221;

The other man turned on the settee to face him.
&#8220;The whole thing has been queer. I had practically
overcome Mr. Collier&#8217;s prejudice and won
his entire approval. Then he broke down; his
health went to the bad, and his manner toward me
seemed to change. I had an idea he went abroad
more to take Virginia away than for any other
reason. Anyway, I knew there was something
wrong, and the two letters I got from her added
126
to that conviction. Her father was trying to get
her to break with me! There was another man
whom he preferred.&#8221;

&#8220;Another!&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, Bailey Weegman.&#8221;

Locke gave a great start, as if he had received
an electric thrust. &#8220;Weegman!&#8221; he cried guardedly.
&#8220;That scoundrel! Collier is crazy, Parlmee!&#8221;

&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve said something! I believe the
man&#8217;s mind is affected. Business reverses may
have done it.&#8221;

&#8220;Do you know that he left his baseball interests
practically in the control of Weegman?&#8221;

&#8220;No; but it doesn&#8217;t surprise me. In some way,
that scoundrel has got a hold on him. Weegman
has tried hard to undermine me with Virginia.
I&#8217;ve always disliked him and his detestable laugh.
Who is he, anyway? Where did he come from,
and what are his antecedents?&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to ask somebody else.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s Virginia I&#8217;m worrying about now,&#8221; said
Parlmee, tossing aside his half-smoked cigarette.

&#8220;But if she was contemplating sailing for the
United States with her father&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Her cablegram to me didn&#8217;t mention her
father. I got the impression that she was sailing
alone.&#8221;

127&#8220;Alone! Great Scott!&#8221;

&#8220;And she didn&#8217;t sail! Where is she? What
happened to her? Do you wonder I&#8217;m rattled?
I&#8217;ve made arrangements so that I can have a
month, if necessary, to dig into this business. If
that isn&#8217;t enough, I&#8217;ll take all the time needed.
It&#8217;s the deuce to pay, Locke, as sure as you&#8217;re a
foot high.&#8221;

&#8220;In more ways than one,&#8221; agreed Lefty. &#8220;I
could tell you some other things, but you&#8217;ve got
enough to worry about. We must arrange to keep
in touch with each other. I presume I&#8217;ll go back
to Fernandon when I get through here.&#8221;

&#8220;Here&#8217;s my New York address,&#8221; said Parlmee,
handing over his card, and rising.

Five minutes after they separated old Jack
Kennedy arrived, dusty and weary from his railroad
journey. His shoulders were a trifle stooped,
and he looked older by years, but his keen eyes
lighted with a twinkle as he grasped Locke&#8217;s hand.

&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d beat me to it, Lefty,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t have called on you to make the jaunt,
but I had to chin with you face to face. Let&#8217;s
talk first and feed our faces afterward.&#8221;

The veteran registered, and they took the elevator.
Carrying Kennedy&#8217;s traveling bag, a boy
conducted them. A bar boy, bearing a tray that
was decorated with drinks, was knocking on a
128
door. Within the room somebody called for him
to enter, and he did so as Locke was passing at
old Jack&#8217;s heels. By chance Lefty obtained a
glimpse of the interior of that room before the
door closed behind the boy. Two men, smoking
cigars, were sitting at opposite sides of a table
on which were empty glasses. They were Mit
Skullen and Bailey Weegman.

Left together in Kennedy&#8217;s room, Locke told
the old manager what he had seen, and immediately
Kennedy&#8217;s face was twisted into a wrathful
pucker.

&#8220;You&#8217;re sure?&#8221;

&#8220;Dead sure,&#8221; replied Locke.

&#8220;Well, it sorter confirms a little suspicion
that&#8217;s been creepin&#8217; inter my noddle. The Blue
Stockings are up against somethin&#8217; more&#8217;n the
Feds, and the Feds have chewed the team to
pieces. Within the last three days they&#8217;ve nailed
Temple, Dayly, and Hyland. There&#8217;s only the
remnants of a ball club left.&#8221;

Locke was aghast. &#8220;Gene Temple, too!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;The boy I found! I thought he would
stick.&#8221;

&#8220;Money gets the best of &#8217;em. Why shouldn&#8217;t
it, when them lads ought to have been tied up
before this with Blue Stockings contracts? The
bars have been left down for the Feds, and they&#8217;ve
129
raided the preserves. Seems just like they&#8217;ve
been invited to come in and help themselves.
Why not, with a team without a manager, and
everything left at loose ends? Never heard of
such criminal folly! But mebbe it ain&#8217;t folly;
mebbe it&#8217;s plain cadougery. I&#8217;ve had an idea
there was somethin&#8217; crooked behind it, but couldn&#8217;t
just quite nose it out. Now, with Weegman and
Mit Skullen gettin&#8217; together private, I see a light.
Garrity&#8217;s the man! You know how he got his
dirty paws on the Rockets. Well, if he ain&#8217;t
workin&#8217; to gobble the Blue Stockings I&#8217;ll eat my
hat! I&#8217;ll bet that right now Tom Garrity&#8217;s gathered
in all the loose stock of the club that he could
buy, and he&#8217;s countin&#8217; on havin&#8217; enough to give
him control before the season opens. He saw his
chance, with the Feds reachin&#8217; for every decent
player they could lay their hands on, and he went
for it. What if the Blue Stockings do have a
busted team this season? In three years the club
might be built up again, and it&#8217;s a sure money-maker
just as long as it can keep in the first
division. Lynchin&#8217; is what a crook like Garrity
deserves!&#8221;

Kennedy&#8217;s eyes were flashing, and he was literally
quivering with wrath. Despite the fact
that he was tired, he strode up and down the room.

&#8220;Weegman must be Garrity&#8217;s tool, the creature
130
who is helping him do the dirty work,&#8221; said
Locke.

&#8220;You&#8217;ve got his number! How he came to
pick you for a mark, I don&#8217;t know, unless it was
because he thought you let me work you to death,
havin&#8217; no mind of your own. He knew he couldn&#8217;t
put anythin&#8217; over with me, and so he decided to
get rid of me; but he had to have somebody for
a manager who would appear to be all right.
He&#8217;s got to be blocked. There&#8217;s only one way.&#8221;

&#8220;How?&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to accept, and sign a contract to
manage the team.&#8221;

Lefty gasped. &#8220;But,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do
that! You&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m out. He wouldn&#8217;t have me, even if I&#8217;d
do the work for no salary.&#8221;

&#8220;But I can&#8217;t agree to Weegman&#8217;s terms. I
couldn&#8217;t do anything of my own accord; I couldn&#8217;t
sign a player unless he agreed. He made that
plain.&#8221;

&#8220;But he wouldn&#8217;t dare put anything like that
in the contract. It would be too barefaced. The
minute you have the authority you can get to work
savin&#8217; the remnants of the team by signin&#8217; up
the players the Feds haven&#8217;t grabbed already. I
have a line on a few good youngsters who went
back to the minors last year because there wasn&#8217;t
131
room for them. Put proof of Weegman&#8217;s treachery
before Collier, and Weegman&#8217;s done for! It&#8217;s
the one play that&#8217;s got to be made in this here
pinch.&#8221;

There was a knock on the door.

&#8220;Come in!&#8221; called Kennedy.

Bailey Weegman entered, smiling.


132CHAPTER XVSIGNING THE MANAGER

Weegman came in boldly. His manner
was ingratiating, yet somewhat
insolent, and he chuckled as he saw
the look of surprise on the face of Lefty Locke.
&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Here we are! This is
first rate. Now we can get together and do
things.&#8221;

To the southpaw&#8217;s increasing astonishment,
Kennedy stepped forward quickly, seized Weegman&#8217;s
hand, and shook it cordially and heartily.

&#8220;I wired for Locke,&#8221; said the old manager.
&#8220;I felt sure I could talk sense into his head.
Didn&#8217;t like to see him make a fool of himself and
let a great opportunity slip through his fingers
just because of a false notion about loyalty to
me. But I didn&#8217;t expect you before to-morrow.&#8221;

Lefty was a trifle bewildered. Kennedy had
known Weegman was coming to Indianapolis; in
fact, had arranged to meet him there. Collier&#8217;s
representative beamed on Locke.

&#8220;Sorry I couldn&#8217;t wait to see the finish of that
133
game in Fernandon,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but I saw enough
to satisfy me. You did well to beat the Wind
Jammers with that bunch of half invalids behind
you, and your own arm all to the bad. Still,
Wiley sort of handed you the game.&#8221;

&#8220;The score was three to two,&#8221; reminded Lefty.

&#8220;The Wind Jammers couldn&#8217;t hit. They were
a lot of freaks, a burlesque baseball team.&#8221;
Weegman turned again to old Jack. &#8220;If you
can talk some sense into Locke, you&#8217;ll succeed
where I failed. I wasted time, money, and breath
on him; gave him up then. Let me tell you a
joke.&#8221; He began to laugh, and the southpaw
writhed inwardly. &#8220;Who do you think wants to
manage the Blue Stockings? You can&#8217;t guess?
Well, it&#8217;s Skullen; yes, Mit Skullen. Actually
came after the job. Got me cornered and gave
me a great game of talk, trying to convince me
that he could fill the bill. I was listening to his
spiel when I caught a glimpse of you two passing
the door of my room. Called the desk and asked
the number of your room. Then I shook old Mit
and came around. The idea of Mit Skullen managing
a Big League club! Isn&#8217;t that funny?&#8221;
His whole body shook with merriment as he spoke.

Kennedy seemed to be amused also, and joined
in Weegman&#8217;s laughter. &#8220;Wonder what Tom
Garrity would say to that? Skullen must have
134
forgotten his old nemesis, John Barleycorn. It
was John that put him down and out as a prize
fighter and a ball player.&#8221;

&#8220;He says he hasn&#8217;t looked at the stuff for four
months. You should have heard him trying to
convince me that he had the makings of a great
manager.&#8221;

Lefty knew Weegman was lying regarding the
nature of the private consultation that had been
held in a nearby room. But Kennedy seemed to
be unaware of this.

&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t take Skullen under any conditions,
would you?&#8221; asked old Jack.

&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have him if he was ready to pay to
manage the team. Collier would lift my scalp
if I fell for anything like that. But I&#8217;ve got a line
on a good man if&#8211;if&#8211;&#8221; He faltered, and looked
at Locke, smiling.

&#8220;We&#8217;ll settle that right here,&#8221; declared Kennedy,
with a growl. &#8220;Locke&#8217;s the lad. I haven&#8217;t
had time to talk to him much, but I was telling
him before you came in that he&#8217;d have to accept.
As for me, a Class AA team ain&#8217;t so worse.
You&#8217;re dead sure I can hook up with St.
Paul?&#8221;

&#8220;I wired you about the proposition from Byers.
He wants you, but he wasn&#8217;t going to try to cut in
on us. Did you send him word?&#8221;

135&#8220;Not yet. Decided to have my talk with Lefty
first.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve always liked you, Kennedy,&#8221; said Weegman.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been a great man in your day.
You&#8217;re a good man now, but it needs younger
blood, especially in this fight against the Feds,
confound them! About so often a team needs to
change managers, especially when it begins to
slip. The Blue Stockings began to slip last year,
and the Feds have given us a push. Locke&#8217;s
young, and he&#8217;s got the energy to build the team
up. Working together, we can put it on its feet
again. He&#8217;ll have the very best counsel and advice.
He&#8217;s a favorite with the fans, and he&#8217;ll be
tolerated where you would be blamed. He&#8217;ll come
through and win out. Of that I am certain. The
Feds will blow before the season&#8217;s over, and the
woods will be full of first-class players begging
for jobs. Next season should see the Stockings
stronger than ever, and the man who&#8217;s managing
the team&#8217;s bound to be popular. He&#8217;ll get a lot of
credit.&#8221;

Lefty had taken a chair. He opened his lips to
speak, but stopped when he caught a warning sign
from old Jack behind Weegman&#8217;s shoulder.

&#8220;Is that contract ready for the boy?&#8221; asked
Kennedy.

&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it in my pocket.&#8221;

136&#8220;Then nail him right now. Push it at him, and
we&#8217;ll make him sign. Don&#8217;t let him get away.&#8221;

Weegman produced the document. Then, for a
moment, he seemed to hesitate, flashing old Jack a
look and giving Locke a hard stare.

&#8220;You understand the conditions?&#8221; he said, addressing
the latter.

&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Lefty, &#8220;you made them plain
enough for a child to understand when you talked
to me in Fernandon.&#8221;

&#8220;Course he understands,&#8221; cut in Kennedy.
&#8220;He told me, and I told him to grab on without
makin&#8217; no further talk. Just as you say, Weegman,
with proper advice he can swing the thing.
It looks pretty big to him, and he&#8217;s doubtful. Let
him look at that paper.&#8221;

He took it from Weegman&#8217;s hand and looked it
over himself. It was practically the same sort of
an agreement old Jack had signed himself when
he took control of the team, and the name of
Charles Collier, properly witnessed, had already
been affixed to it. With the contract in his possession,
along with Collier&#8217;s power of attorney,
Weegman could sign up any one he chose to manage
the Blue Stockings. For a fleeting instant
Kennedy&#8217;s face was twisted into an expression of
rage, which, however, Collier&#8217;s private secretary
did not catch.

137Locke saw that flash of anger and understood;
old Jack was playing the fox, and losing no time
about it.

&#8220;Skullen will do for the other witness,&#8221; said
Weegman, going to the room telephone. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
feel bad, of course, but I told him he didn&#8217;t have a
show in the world.&#8221; He called the operator and
gave the number of a room.

While Weegman was engaged, Kennedy handed
the agreement over to Locke. &#8220;You sign it just
as it is,&#8221; he directed. &#8220;You&#8217;ve had your talk
with Mr. Weegman, and you know what he said
to you. You don&#8217;t have to chin it over any more.&#8221;

By this time Weegman had got Skullen on the
phone and asked him to come round to Kennedy&#8217;s
room, giving him the number. Locke sat grimly
reading the contract until Skullen knocked at the
door.

&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll feel bad, Mit,&#8221; said Weegman,
admitting the man, &#8220;but you know I told you there
wasn&#8217;t a show in the world of me signing you up
as manager. It&#8217;s settled with Locke, and I want
you to witness him put his autograph to the paper.
Now don&#8217;t make a growl, but do as you&#8217;re
wanted.&#8221;

Skullen kept still as directed, but he looked as if
Weegman&#8217;s first words had surprised him a trifle.

Kennedy had produced a fountain pen and
138
thrust it into Locke&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Sign right here,
son,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see how pretty you
write.&#8221;

&#8220;Wait!&#8221; cried Weegman, his eyes on the southpaw,
who had promptly moved up to the little
table. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t forgotten our talk? You
understand?&#8221;

&#8220;I haven&#8217;t forgotten a thing,&#8221; asserted Lefty,
boldly and swiftly writing his name. &#8220;There it
is!&#8221;


139CHAPTER XVITHE WRONG STOOL PIGEON

Skullen and Kennedy attached their
names as witnesses. The thing was done;
Lefty Locke&#8211;Philip Hazelton was the name
he wrote on the contract&#8211;was now manager of the
Blue Stockings. He received a duplicate copy,
which he folded and slipped into his pocket.

&#8220;Now we&#8217;re all set for business,&#8221; said Bailey
Weegman. &#8220;I congratulate you, Locke. One
time I was afraid you didn&#8217;t have sense enough to
welcome Opportunity when she knocked. I&#8217;ll see
you later, Mit, if you&#8217;re around. We&#8217;ve got to
square away now and have a little conference.
Don&#8217;t cry because you didn&#8217;t get the job.&#8221;

&#8220;Cry&#8211;nothin&#8217;!&#8221; said Skullen. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
have taken it if you&#8217;d handed it to me with twice
the salary.&#8221;

&#8220;Old Mit&#8217;s disappointed,&#8221; chuckled Weegman,
when the door closed behind him, &#8220;but he
doesn&#8217;t want anybody to know it. He&#8217;ll deny he
came looking for the position, of course.&#8221;

Kennedy had seated himself, and Weegman
140
drew a chair up to the table, producing a packet of
papers and running them over until he found the
one he wanted.

&#8220;Here&#8217;s a list of the men the Feds have grabbed
off us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Grist, Orth, Temple, Nelson,
Hyland, and Lewis. Grist is no particular loss,
but Temple and Orth knock a hole in the pitching
staff. Nelson was our reliance behind the bat.
With Dayly and Lewis gone, the whole side of the
infield is wide open. We ought to be able to fill
Hyland&#8217;s place in right garden.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s a swell team that&#8217;s left!&#8221; said Locke.
&#8220;And you told me that Dillon was negotiating with
the outlaws.&#8221;

&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t jumped; he hasn&#8217;t had the nerve,&#8221;
sneered Weegman, snapping his fingers. &#8220;Instead,
he&#8217;s been howling for a contract. You&#8217;d
find him waiting if you didn&#8217;t sign him until the
first of April.&#8221; For just a flicker he had actually
seemed to betray annoyance because Pink Dillon
had not followed the example of the deserters, but
he ended with a laugh.

&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said the new manager, &#8220;that
I&#8217;d better get busy and try to save the pieces. The
men who haven&#8217;t jumped should be signed up without
delay.&#8221;

&#8220;Of course,&#8221; agreed Weegman blandly. &#8220;You
must send out the contracts. Unluckily, I haven&#8217;t
141
any blanks with me, but I&#8217;ll see that you are furnished
with them to-morrow.&#8221;

&#8220;Every day counts, perhaps every hour; by to-morrow
we may lose another good man, or more.&#8221;

&#8220;Not much danger, and you don&#8217;t want to make
the mistake of getting into a panic and trying to
do things in too much of a hurry. We&#8217;ve been
farming some clever youngsters, more than enough
to make up a team; but you should consult with
Kennedy about them, and take only the right ones.
You&#8217;ll have the most trouble getting hold of
pitchers.&#8221;

&#8220;Youngsters,&#8221; said Locke, &#8220;are all right; but
do you mean to suggest that we should stop the
gaps wholly with men who lack Big League experience?
You know how much show that sort of a
team would have in the race. We&#8217;ve got to make
some deals that will give us some players who
have ripened. It&#8217;ll cost money, too.&#8221;

&#8220;Right there,&#8221; said Weegman, &#8220;is where you&#8217;re
going to need the check-rein. Charles Collier
won&#8217;t stand for needless extravagance in that line,
I know, and I shall not countenance the purchasing
of high-priced men.&#8221;

The blood rose into Lefty&#8217;s face; he tingled to
tell the rascal something, but again a warning
flicker of Kennedy&#8217;s left eye restrained him.

&#8220;There are lots of good youngsters coming on,&#8221;
142
said the veteran soothingly. &#8220;There were three
or four I could have used last season if I&#8217;d had
room for them. We&#8217;ll run over the list and see
how they&#8217;ll fit in.&#8221;

For another hour they continued in conclave,
and a dozen times Weegman took occasion to
impress upon Locke that he should do nothing
definite without receiving Weegman&#8217;s approval.
When he seemed to feel that he had driven this
into the new manager&#8217;s head, he excused himself
on the pretext of attending to a pressing matter,
and departed, leaving old Jack and Lefty together.
Kennedy quietly locked the door. Lefty jumped
to his feet and began pacing the floor like a caged
tiger.

&#8220;Never had such a job to keep my hands off a
man!&#8221; he raged. &#8220;Only for you, I&#8217;d&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;I know,&#8221; said old Jack, returning and sitting
down heavily. &#8220;I wanted to kick him myself,
and I think I shall do it some day soon. He&#8217;s
crooked as a corkscrew and rotten as a last year&#8217;s
early apple. But he ain&#8217;t shrewd; he only thinks
he is. He&#8217;s fooled himself. You never agreed to
his verbal terms, and, just as I said, he didn&#8217;t dare
put them in writing. According to that contract,
you&#8217;ve got as much power as I ever had, and you
can exercise it. It&#8217;s up to you to get busy. Don&#8217;t
wait for contract forms from Weegman; they&#8217;ll be
143
delayed. I have plenty. Wire the old players
who are left that contracts will be mailed to them
to-night.&#8221;

Locke stopped by Kennedy&#8217;s chair and dropped
a hand on the old man&#8217;s shoulder.

&#8220;And you&#8217;re going to St. Paul?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been handed a wretched deal.&#8221;

&#8220;Nix on the St. Paul business, son; there&#8217;s
nothing to it. That wolf thought I swallowed that
guff. Byers is Garrity&#8217;s friend, and it&#8217;s plain
now that Garrity&#8217;s mixed up in this dirty business.
It was easy enough to ask if I&#8217;d consider
hooking up with St. Paul. By the time I got round
to saying yes, Byers could tell me it was off.
This time, Lefty, I&#8217;m out of the game for good.&#8221;
His voice sounded heavy and dull, and his shoulders
sagged.

The southpaw was silent, words failing him.
After a few minutes old Jack looked up into the
face of his youthful companion, and smiled wryly.

&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a little glimpse of what goes on behind
the scenes in baseball,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The fans
that pay their money to see the games look on it,
generally, as a fine, clean sport&#8211;which, in one
way, it is. That part the public pays to see, the
game, is on the level. There&#8217;s a good reason: the
crookedest magnate in the business&#8211;and, believe
me, there&#8217;s one who can look down the back of his
144
own neck without trying to turn round&#8211;knows it
would spell ruin to put over a frame-up on the
open field. By nature the players themselves are
like the average run of human critters, honest and
dishonest; but experience has taught them that
they can&#8217;t pull off any double deals without cutting
their own throats. People who talk about
fixed games, especially in the World&#8217;s Series, show
up their ignorance. It can&#8217;t be done.

&#8220;But when it comes to tricks and holdups, and
highway robberies and assassination, there&#8217;s always
somethin&#8217; doing off stage. What you&#8217;ve
seen is only a patch. The men who run things are
out for the coin, and they aren&#8217;t any better, as a
rule, than the high financiers who plunder railroads
and loot public treasuries. They&#8217;ll smile in
a man&#8217;s face while they&#8217;re whetting the knife for
his back. Some of them have put the knife into
Charles Collier now, and they intend to sink it to
the hilt. You&#8217;ve been picked as a cat&#8217;s-paw to
help them pull their chestnuts off the coals. They
intend to fatten their batting average at your expense,
and when it&#8217;s all over you&#8217;ll be knocked out
of the box for good. You&#8217;ll get the blame while
they pluck the plums.&#8221;

&#8220;Kennedy,&#8221; said Locke, his voice hard as
chilled steel, &#8220;they&#8217;ve picked the wrong stool
pigeon. My eyes aren&#8217;t sewed up. With your
145
help, I&#8217;m going to find a way to spoil their villainous
schemes. I know you&#8217;ll help me.&#8221;

The veteran sprang up, a bit of the old-time fire
in his face. &#8220;You bet your life, son! That&#8217;s why
I wired for you to come on, and that&#8217;s why I
wanted you to pretend to take the hook and sign
up with Weegman. I knew we could work together,
and it puts us in position to get the harpoon
into them before they wise up to what&#8217;s doing.
Let&#8217;s get busy.&#8221;


146CHAPTER XVIIGETTING INTO ACTION

Locke was for open work and defiance of
Weegman, but Kennedy argued against it.

&#8220;You want to get the jump on that
snake,&#8221; said the old man, digging a package of
contract forms for players out of his traveling
bag. &#8220;He won&#8217;t be looking for you to get into
action so sudden, and you&#8217;ll gain a lap before he
knows it. When it comes to fighting a polecat, a
wise man takes precautions. Weegman&#8217;s gone to
send word to his pals of the slick job he&#8217;s put
over, and he&#8217;ll be coming back to bother us pretty
soon. We don&#8217;t want to be here when he comes.&#8221;

So, for the purpose of conducting their private
business, another room was engaged, and an arrangement
made whereby no person, no matter
how insistent he might be, should be told where to
find them. Then a telegraph messenger boy was
summoned to that room, and telegrams were sent
to the still loyal Blue Stockings players, stating
that contracts were being mailed for their signatures.
Then the contracts were filled out, sealed,
and dropped into the mail chute.

147A square meal was ordered and served in the
private room, and for nearly three hours Lefty
and Jack talked. They had many things to tell
each other, but their principal topic was the filling
of the frightful gaps made in the team by the
Federal raids, and both agreed that the time had
come when the close-fisted financial policy of the
Blue Stockings must be abandoned; players fully
as good as the ones lost, or better, if possible, must
be obtained at any cost. Various team combinations
that seemed to balance to a nicety were made
up on paper, but how to get the men coveted was
the problem.

&#8220;We&#8217;ve got two catchers left,&#8221; said Kennedy,
&#8220;but the best of the pair ain&#8217;t in the same class as
the man we&#8217;ve lost. We&#8217;ve got to have a backstop
as good as Nelson. And when it comes to
pitchers&#8211;say, son, is it possible there ain&#8217;t any
show at all of your coming back?&#8221;

&#8220;I wish I could answer that,&#8221; confessed Locke.
&#8220;At any rate, we&#8217;ve got to have two more first-string
men. If this Mysterious Jones I told you
of is anywhere near as good as he looked to&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Not one chance in a hundred that he&#8217;s good
enough to carry a regular share of the pitching
the first season, no matter what he might develop
into with experience. The Wolves have been hurt
least by the Feds, and you might pick something
148
worth while off Ben Frazer if you paid his price.
Last fall he offered to trade me that youngster,
Keeper, for Dayly, and since then he&#8217;s bought
Red Callahan from Brennan. That&#8217;ll put Keeper
on the bench. You know what Keeper is, and
I&#8217;ve always regretted letting Frazer get him off
me for five thousand, but it was Collier&#8217;s idea.
The boy&#8217;d look well on our third cushion about
now. But don&#8217;t lose sight of the fact that it&#8217;s
pitchers we&#8217;ve got to have.&#8221;

Locke took the five-fifty train for New York,
leaving Weegman, whom he had succeeded in
avoiding, frothing around the Grand in search of
him. Kennedy knew how to reach Frazer by
wire, and he had received a reply to his telegram
that the manager of the Wolves would meet Lefty
at the Great Eastern the following night. Between
Kennedy and Frazer there had always existed
a bond of understanding and friendship.

Despite the burden he had assumed, the new
manager of the Blue Stockings slept well. It was
this faculty of getting sleep and recuperation under
any circumstances that had enabled him to become
known as the &#8220;Iron Man.&#8221;

At breakfast the following morning he received
a slight shock. Three tables in front of him, with
his back turned, sat a man with fine shoulders, a
bull neck, and a bullet head. Mit Skullen was
149
traveling eastward by the same train. Lefty cut
his breakfast short and left the diner without having
been observed.

&#8220;If he should see me, he&#8217;d probably take the
first opportunity to wire back to Weegman,&#8221;
thought Locke, &#8220;and I&#8217;m going to follow old
Jack&#8217;s advice about leaving Weegman in the dark
for a while.&#8221;

There was a possibility, of course, that Skullen
would come wandering through the train and discover
him, but, to his satisfaction, nothing of the
kind happened. All the long forenoon he was
whirled through a snow-covered country without
being annoyed by the appearance of Garrity&#8217;s
henchman, and he had plenty of time to meditate
on the situation and the plans laid by himself and
Kennedy.

But it was necessary to eat again, and shortly
before Albany was reached he returned to the
diner, hoping Skullen had already had lunch.
The man was not there when he sat down, but he
had scarcely given his order when the fellow&#8217;s
hand dropped on his shoulder.

&#8220;Hully smokes!&#8221; exclaimed Mit, staring down,
wide-eyed, at the southpaw. &#8220;What&#8217;s this mean?
I can hardly believe me lamps. You must have
left Indianap&#8217; same time I did, and Weeg asked
me twice if I&#8217;d seen anything of you.&#8221;

150&#8220;Weegman?&#8221; said Lefty, startled, but outwardly
serene. &#8220;Is he on this train?&#8221;

&#8220;Nix. Last I know, he was tearing up the
Grand looking for you. How&#8217;s it happened you
skipped without dropping him word?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see my folks, who live in Jersey,&#8221;
Locke answered, truthfully enough.

&#8220;But you&#8217;ll stop in the big town to-night?
Where do you hang out?&#8221;

&#8220;Usually at the Prince Arthur.&#8221; This was
likewise true, although the southpaw had now no
intention of putting up there on this occasion.

Mit looked at his watch. &#8220;We must be pulling
into Albany,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to get a paper.
See you later.&#8221;

&#8220;Go ahead and shoot your telegram to Weegman,&#8221;
thought Locke. &#8220;Any message sent me
at the Prince Arthur is liable to remain unopened
for some time.&#8221;

He had finished his lunch and was back in the
Pullman when Skullen found him again. The
man planted himself at Lefty&#8217;s side and passed
over a newspaper, grinning as he pointed out an
item on the sporting page:


Even though it was rumored that old Jack Kennedy was to
be let out, the selection of Locke as his successor is a surprise.
As a pitcher Locke has had an amazingly successful career and
has made an enviable reputation, but he has had no
151managerial experience, having come to the Big League directly from
the bushes. Whether or not he has the stuff of which capable
managers are made is a matter of uncertainty; but, with the
Blue Stockings badly chewed to pieces by the Feds, Collier
might have been expected, had he decided to drop Kennedy, to
replace the veteran with a man of some practical knowledge in
that line. The policy of the Stockings for the last year or two
has been rather queer, to say the least, and the effect upon the
team can be seen in its present rating.
 

That was the final paragraph. Collier, sick
and absent in Europe, was credited with the deal;
not a word about Weegman. The rascal, pulling
the wires, was keeping himself in the background.
For a moment Lefty thought of Jack
Stillman, a reporter friend, and felt a desire to
give him some inside information which, in cold
type, would be pretty certain to make the interested
public sit up and take notice. But the time
was not ripe for a move like that, and he dismissed
the thought.

Still grinning, Skullen jammed his elbow into
Locke&#8217;s ribs. &#8220;How do you like that?&#8221; he inquired
gloatingly. &#8220;That&#8217;s the way them cheap
newspaper ginks pans you out when they get a
chance.&#8221;

The southpaw was suddenly attacked by an intense
distaste for the company of Tom Garrity&#8217;s
coarse hireling. He handed the paper back in
silence. But the feeling of dislike and antagonism
152
was evidently felt by Skullen, for, after a few
minutes&#8217; silence, he got up and walked out of the
car; and, to his satisfaction, Lefty saw no more of
him during the remainder of the journey.

An uncomfortable storm of rain and sleet was
raging when New York was reached shortly after
nightfall. A taxi bore Locke to the Great Eastern,
where he learned that Frazer had not yet arrived.
Having registered, he took the elevator
for his room on the seventh floor, and, as he was
borne upward, a descending car, well filled with
people, slipped silently past, and Lefty caught a
momentary glimpse of their faces through the
iron grillwork. One face he saw quite plainly,
that of a charming young woman in her early
twenties&#8211;a face he recognized at once.

&#8220;Virginia Collier!&#8221; gasped Lefty, in astonishment.

He did not leave the car; back to the main floor
he went. After hastily looking around for the
young woman he sought, he made inquiries at the
desk. He was informed that no Miss Collier was
stopping in the hotel. Still confident that he had
not been mistaken, and thinking it probable she
was dining there with friends, he had her paged.
Even when the report came that no one answered
to the name, he did not give up. From various
vantage points, he spent at least twenty minutes
153
looking over the people at dinner in the main dining
room, the grill, and the palm room. At the
end of that time he was confident that Charles Collier&#8217;s
daughter was not dining at the Great Eastern.

&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he admitted to himself, &#8220;it&#8217;s possible
I was mistaken, but I would have sworn it
was Virginia.&#8221;

He went up to his room and prepared for dinner,
burdened by the conviction that he had been
baffled; that fate had played him a trick. He
would have given much for fifteen minutes&#8217; conversation
with the daughter of the Big Chief,
and he was impressed with the belief that he had
passed her almost within an arm&#8217;s reach.

This feeling was followed by one of uncertainty
regarding Frazer. Old Jack had assured him
that the manager of the Wolves would meet him
at the Great Eastern, and he had relied on Kennedy
without attempting to get into direct communication
with Frazer, and perhaps, after all,
he would not come.

&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have to run him down,&#8221; considered
Lefty. &#8220;And I want to get to him before Weegman
can get to me. If I don&#8217;t, he&#8217;ll be sure to
try to ball up any deal I attempt to put
across.&#8221;

Choosing to eat in the grill, he notified the desk
154
where he could be found should any one ask for
him. But he had scarcely begun on the first course
when he heard his name spoken, and looked up to
find Ben Frazer smiling down upon him.


155CHAPTER XVIIITHE FIRST DEAL

&#8220;Just in time to get in on the eats, I see,&#8221;
said the manager of the famous Wolves,
shaking hands with Locke. &#8220;It&#8217;s a rotten
night, my feet are wet, and I&#8217;m awfully hungry.
Only for Kennedy&#8217;s message I&#8217;d be on my way to
Chicago.&#8221;

A waiter placed a chair, and he sat down, took
the menu card, and quickly gave his order. He
was a short, thick-set, shrewd-faced man; his hair
was turning gray on the temples, but he seemed
to have lost little of the nervous energy and alertness
that had been his in the old days when he
had been called the swiftest second sacker in the
business. He had been an umpire baiter then,
but in later years his methods had changed, and
never once since becoming a manager had he been
given the gate. Nevertheless, while he had gained
in diplomacy, he had relaxed no whit in aggressiveness.
Led by old Ben, the Wolves fought to
the last ditch.
&#8220;Now, tell me about it,&#8221; he requested, turning
156
to Lefty. &#8220;How in thunder did you happen to
let them rope you into such a mess?&#8221;

&#8220;You mean&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Getting tied up as manager of the Blue Stockings.
Boy, you&#8217;re the goat; you&#8217;ve been chosen
for the sacrifice. Somebody had to fall, of course,
but it&#8217;s a shame that you should be the victim.
I&#8217;d thought you too wise to tumble into that
trap.&#8221;

&#8220;Then you think it is a trap?&#8221; asked the southpaw,
feeling the blood hot in his cheeks.

&#8220;Of course it is! The Stockings have been undermined
and blown wide open. They&#8217;ve got as
much show this year as a snowball would have in
a baker&#8217;s oven. They&#8217;ll land in the subcellar with
a sickening thud, and there&#8217;s no way of stopping
them.&#8221;

&#8220;No way&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;No way under heaven, take it from me! I&#8217;ve
been in the business long enough to know what
I&#8217;m talking about. It takes years to build up such
a fighting machine, and, when it&#8217;s torn to pieces,
rebuilding is bound to be another job of years.
The public won&#8217;t understand. You&#8217;ll get the
kicks and the curses. As a successful pitcher
you&#8217;ve been a favorite; as an unsuccessful manager
you&#8217;ll be about as popular as a rusty spike
in an automobile tire. Crowds are always fickle.
157
When a man&#8217;s winning they howl their heads off
for him; but let him strike a losing streak and
they scramble like mad to pelt him with mud and
brick-bats.&#8221;

&#8220;But somebody has to build up a team.&#8221;

&#8220;Somebody has to start it and get the blame.
He&#8217;s the goat. Where&#8217;s Burkett, who managed
the Wolves before I came in? Out in the Border
League. Where&#8217;s Ashton and Gerrish, who
struggled with the Blue Stockings before Kennedy
stepped in on the turn of the tide? One&#8217;s running
a cigar store in Kewanee, the other&#8217;s drinking
himself to death in Muskegon; both left the
game with busted reputations and broken hearts.
Where&#8217;s McConnell, who tried to make a ball team
of the Hornets before Brennan&#8217;s day? He took
to the coke, and his friends are paying for his
keep in a private bug-house. Where&#8217;s Decker,
who had a crack at the Panthers&#8211;But what&#8217;s
the use! There&#8217;s no surer way for a good man
to ruin his career than to manage a losing ball
team.&#8221;

&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Locke, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to manage
a winner.&#8221;

Frazer gazed at him pityingly. &#8220;Swell chance
you&#8217;ve got! About one in fifty thousand. You
haven&#8217;t got the makings of an ordinary second-division
team left.&#8221;

158&#8220;I know the Feds have copped off some of our
best men, but&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Some! Some! I should so remark! But
don&#8217;t blame it all on the Feds. They were practically
invited to come in and take their pick.
The bars were let down. All your players knew
there was trouble. They heard all sorts of rumors
that made them nervous and uncertain.
They didn&#8217;t see any contracts coming their way
to be signed. They knew there was something
the matter with Collier. It was even said he&#8217;d
gone crazy. They knew Kennedy was going to
get out from under. There was gossip about old
men being shunted and new blood taken on. What
they didn&#8217;t know was where they were at. It was
all nicely worked to get them to take the running
long jump.&#8221;

&#8220;Then you believe there was a plot to smash
the team?&#8221;

&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be a mind reader to get my
opinion, but I&#8217;m saying this here private, man to
man. I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; round talking for publication.&#8221;

&#8220;But you&#8217;re wrong about Kennedy getting out;
he was dropped.&#8221;

&#8220;Was he?&#8221;

&#8220;Sure.&#8221;

Frazer twisted his face into a queer grimace.
159
&#8220;Old Jack Kennedy was too wise to stick on under
any such conditions. He knew what it meant,
and I&#8217;ll guarantee that he wouldn&#8217;t have managed
the Blue Stockings this year for twice the salary
he got last. What I&#8217;ve got against him is that he
didn&#8217;t put you wise before you tied up.&#8221;

&#8220;It was on his advice that I consented to manage
the team,&#8221; replied Locke.

&#8220;What?&#8221; exclaimed Frazer. &#8220;Is that straight?
He advised you to&#8211;The infernal old scoundrel!&#8221;

Locke warmed immediately in defense of Kennedy.
The manager of the Wolves listened, uncertain,
shaking his head doubtfully.

&#8220;He may not have meant it,&#8221; he admitted presently,
&#8220;but he&#8217;s got you in bad, boy. You
haven&#8217;t got a show against the powers you&#8217;ll have
to buck, and the conditions that were fixed up for
you in advance.&#8221;

&#8220;As to that, time will tell,&#8221; said Lefty. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to make one almighty try. First, I&#8217;ve got
to plug the gaps. What have you got to sell that I
want?&#8221;

&#8220;Nothing that you&#8217;ll pay the price for. I know
Collier&#8217;s policy.&#8221;

&#8220;Collier is in Europe, and I&#8217;m manager of the
team, with full authority to make any deals I
please. Here&#8217;s my contract.&#8221; He placed it before
160
old Ben. &#8220;Collier will have to stand for any
trade I put through. I&#8217;ll buy Smoke Jordan off
you.&#8221;

&#8220;You won&#8217;t! I won&#8217;t sell him.&#8221;

&#8220;Then how about Jack Keeper? You&#8217;ve got
Red Callahan, and I need a third baseman.&#8221;

Frazer finished his soup. &#8220;I won&#8217;t sell you
Keeper,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll trade him. I need
a center fielder in the place of Courtney, who&#8217;s
retired. I&#8217;ll trade Keeper for Herman Brock.&#8221;

At first Locke had no relish for a trade that
would add to the Blue Stockings infield at the
expense of the outfield, even though in his secret
heart he knew Brock had during last season
shown vague symptoms of slowing down. Then
he remembered the list of reserves given him by
Kennedy, on which there was one fast, hard-hitting
youngster who had been sent back to the Western
Canada League, and had made a brilliant
record covering the middle garden for Medicine
Hat.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to trade, I want to buy,&#8221; he persisted.
Then, as if struck by second thought:
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I will do; I&#8217;ll give you Brock
for two men. That&#8217;ll help. We need a catcher.
After King broke his leg you found a great
catcher in Darrow. I&#8217;ll trade you Brock for
Keeper and King.&#8221;

161&#8220;Brick King!&#8221; exploded Frazer indignantly.
&#8220;What do you take me for?&#8221;

&#8220;A business man. You&#8217;ve got three first-string
catchers now; two are all you need. You don&#8217;t
even know that King&#8217;s leg is all right. I&#8217;m willing
to take a chance on him. Brock batted over
three hundred last season. He&#8217;s the hitter you
need to fill that vacancy.&#8221;

&#8220;Not Brick King,&#8221; said the manager of the
Wolves. &#8220;If I didn&#8217;t use him behind the bat
for the whole season, he&#8217;s a fancy pinch hitter.
You&#8217;ve gotter have pitchers. How about
O&#8217;Brien?&#8221;

But Locke knew that Chick O&#8217;Brien, the veteran,
had cracked already. Even though on hot
days, when he could get his wing to work, he
showed flashes of his former brilliant form, and
had, under such conditions, last year pitched
three shut-out games for the Wolves, Chick&#8217;s
record for the season showed a balance on the
wrong side. The southpaw held out for King.
Frazer offered one of the second-string catchers.
Lefty waved the offer aside.

&#8220;Hang it!&#8221; snapped Frazer. &#8220;Give me Brock
and ten thousand dollars, and you may have
Keeper and King.&#8221;

&#8220;You don&#8217;t want much!&#8221; laughed Locke. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
give you Brock and five thousand.&#8221;

162All the way through to the dessert they dickered
and bargained. Frazer wanted Brock, and
wanted him bad. Sympathetic though he might
feel toward Lefty, he never permitted sympathy
to interfere with business. Brock was the man to
fill the position left vacant by Bob Courtney, and
he was sure the Wolves would not be weakened by
the loss of Keeper. But Brick King&#8211;&#8220;What salary are you paying King?&#8221; Lefty
suddenly asked.

&#8220;Five thousand. The Feds got after him, and
I had to make it that.&#8221;

The southpaw laughed. &#8220;With Darrow doing
most of the backstopping, and Larson ready to
fill in any moment he&#8217;s needed, you&#8217;re going to
keep a five-thousand-dollar catcher on the bench
for a pinch hitter! I just called you a business
man, but I feel like taking it back. Isn&#8217;t Madden
likely to kick over a five-thousand-dollar pinch
hitter?&#8221; Madden owned the team.

&#8220;Madden be hanged!&#8221; rasped Frazer, biting
off the end of a cigar he had taken from his case.
&#8220;I&#8217;m the manager! Madden isn&#8217;t always butting
in and paring down expenses, like Collier.&#8221; He
pulled vigorously at the cigar, while the attentive
waiter applied a lighted match.

Lefty had declined a cigar. He smoked occasionally,
and would have done so now, but to do
163
so would indicate an inclination to settle down and
continue the dickering, and he had decided to
make a bluff at bringing the affair to an end. He
called for the check, and insisted on paying the
bill for both.

&#8220;Sorry I&#8217;ve put you to so much trouble,
Frazer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was Kennedy&#8217;s idea that
I might do business with you, but it&#8217;s evident he
was mistaken. I&#8217;ve got some other cards to play,
and time is precious.&#8221; He settled the bill and
tipped the waiter.

Old Ben sat regarding Locke thoughtfully, rolling
out great puffs of smoke. The younger man
was about to rise.

&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; requested the manager of the
Wolves. &#8220;You&#8217;re a regular mule, aren&#8217;t you?
How do you expect to make a trade without compromising
at all? You won&#8217;t even meet me halfway,
confound you! You&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll own up that I was a bit hasty,&#8221; said Lefty,
showing a nervous desire to get away. &#8220;I made
that five-thousand offer without thinking much,
but you understand I&#8217;m rather desperate. If
Collier were here, he&#8217;d probably put the kibosh
on it&#8211;if he found out before the trade was closed.
After that he&#8217;d have to stand for it, no matter
how hard he kicked. Let&#8217;s forget it.&#8221;

Then Frazer showed that peculiar trait of human
164
nature that makes a person doubly eager for
something that seems to be on the point of slipping
away. In his mind he had already fitted
Herman Brock into that gap in center field that
had given him more or less worry. The adjustment
had pleased him; it seemed to balance the
team to a hair. It would give him renewed assurance
of another pennant and a slice of the
World&#8217;s Series money. It was Courtney&#8217;s hitting
in the last series that had enabled the Wolves
to divide the big end of that money; and, like
Courtney, Brock was a terror with the ash.

&#8220;You mule!&#8221; said Frazer. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go up to
your room and fix up the papers. It&#8217;s a trade.&#8221;


165CHAPTER XIXA FLEETING GLIMPSE

Locke betrayed no sign of the triumph that
he felt. Had Frazer held out, he would
have given the ten thousand asked, and
considered himself lucky to get a catcher and a
third sacker, both young men, and coming, in exchange
for an outfielder who could not possibly
last more than another season or two. Collier
might squirm when he learned of the trade, but
perhaps he could be made to see the desperate
necessity of it. The thought that Bailey Weegman
would gnash his teeth and froth at the mouth
gave Lefty an added thrill of pleasure. The first
move to circumvent Weegman and the scheming
scoundrel behind him, Garrity, had been put
through.

&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, with something like a sigh.
&#8220;If you hold me to my word, I suppose it&#8217;s a
trade. We may as well make out the papers.&#8221;

&#8220;What&#8217;s that about a trade?&#8221; asked a voice at
the southpaw&#8217;s back. &#8220;What are you two ginks
cooking up? I saw you chinnin&#8217;, and thought
there was something in the wind.&#8221;

166Skullen had entered the grill and come up without
being observed. There was nothing thin-skinned
about Mit, and apparently he had forgotten
the rebuff given him by Locke on the
train.

&#8220;Hello, Mit!&#8221; said Frazer. &#8220;You&#8217;re just in
time to be a witness. I&#8217;ve traded King and
Keeper for Herm Brock. We&#8217;re going up to
make out the papers now. Come on!&#8221;

Locke rose, his eyes on the intruder, repressing
a laugh as he noted the man&#8217;s expression of incredulity.

&#8220;Traded!&#8221; exclaimed Skullen. &#8220;With Locke?
Say, who&#8217;s backing Locke in this deal? Weeg
told me&#8211;when I talked with him about being
manager&#8211;that any trade that was made would
have to be confirmed by him. Has he agreed to
this deal?&#8221;

&#8220;He don&#8217;t have to,&#8221; said Lefty. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing in my contract that gives him any authority
to interfere with any deal I may choose
to make.&#8221;

Mit followed them from the room and to the
elevator. He was bursting to say more, but he
did not know just how to say it. When they were
in Locke&#8217;s room he began:

&#8220;Keeper and King for that old skate Brock!
What&#8217;s the matter with you, Ben? You&#8217;ve got
167
bats in your belfry! Why, you&#8217;ve gone clean off
your nut! You&#8217;ve&#8211;&#8221;

Frazer cut him short. &#8220;That&#8217;ll be about
enough from you, Mit! Don&#8217;t try to tell me my
business. I&#8217;m getting five thousand bones in the
bargain.&#8221;

&#8220;Hey?&#8221; shouted Skullen, turning on the
young manager of the Blue Stockings. &#8220;Five
thousand bucks! You&#8217;re coughing up that sum
without consulting anybody? Say, you&#8217;re going
in clean over your head. You&#8217;d better hold up
and wire Weegman what you&#8217;re thinking about.
If you don&#8217;t&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;When I want your advice I&#8217;ll ask for it,&#8221; interrupted
Locke sharply. &#8220;You seem to be
greatly interested in this business, for an outsider.&#8221;

Skullen was choked off, but he gurgled and
growled while the papers were being filled out; he
even seemed disposed to refuse to sign as a witness,
but finally did so, muttering:

&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be the devil to pay over this,
you can bet your sweet life on that!&#8221;

Lefty didn&#8217;t care; it was settled, and neither
Collier nor his representative could repudiate the
bargain. Let the crooks rage. The only thing
the southpaw regretted was that Weegman would,
doubtless, quickly learn what had been done; for
168
it was a practical certainty that Skullen would lose
little time in wiring to him. In fact, Mit soon
made an excuse to take his departure, and, in
fancy, Locke saw him making haste to send the
message.

Frazer was wise, also. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to find
yourself bucking a rotten combination, Locke,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;They&#8217;re bound to put it over you before
you&#8217;re through.&#8221;

&#8220;I should worry and lose my sleep!&#8221; was the
light retort. &#8220;Give me a cigar now, Ben; I
haven&#8217;t felt so much like smoking in a month.&#8221;

Locke slept that night in peace. In the infield
there were two big holes left to be filled, short and
second; but the reserve list afforded a dozen men
to pick from, and it was Lefty&#8217;s theory that a certain
number of carefully chosen youngsters, mixed
in with veterans who could steady them, frequently
added the needed fire and dash to a team
that was beginning to slow down. Herman Brock
was gone, but out in Medicine Hat Jock Sheridan
had covered the middle garden like a carpet, and
had batted four hundred and ten&#8211;some hitting!
With Welch and Hyland on his right and left,
Sheridan might compel the Big League fans to give
him something more than a casual once over.

But Locke&#8217;s great pleasure lay in the fact that
he had secured a backstop he had not dared to
169
hope for. Even now he could not understand
why Frazer had been induced to part with Brick
King, the catcher whose almost uncanny skill in
getting the very limit out of second-rate and faltering
pitchers had lifted the Wolves out of the
second division two years ago, and made them pennant
contenders up to the final game of the season.
There was the possibility, of course, that old Ben
believed that King had not thoroughly recovered
from the injury that had sent him to the hospital
last August; but a broken leg was something that
rarely put an athlete down and out indefinitely.

&#8220;In my estimation,&#8221; thought Lefty serenely, as
sleep was stealing over him, &#8220;King has got more
brains and uses them better than any backstop in
the league.&#8221;

The morning papers had something to say about
the deal:


The new manager of the Blue Stockings has been getting
busy. By good authority we are informed that he has traded
Center Fielder Herman Brock for two of Ben Frazer&#8217;s youngsters,
King and Keeper. Through this deal he has obtained
a catcher and a third baseman, but has opened up a hole in
the outfield big enough to roll an Imperator cargo of base hits
through. Of course, the gaping wounds of the Stockings must
be plugged, but it seems like bad surgery to inflict further
mutilation in order to fill the gashes already made. And when
it comes to driving in scores when they count, we predict that
old Herman and his swatstick are going to be lamented.
170Keeper is more or less of an unknown quantity. It&#8217;s true
that Brick King, in condition, is an excellent backstop and a
good hitter, but it must not be forgotten that he has not played
since he was injured last August. And, incidentally, it should
be remembered that Ben Frazer has a head as long as a tape
measure. An expert appraiser should be called in to inspect
any property on which Frazer shows a disposition to relinquish
his grip. It is a good, even-money proposition that old Ben
and the Wolves will get their hooks into the World&#8217;s Series
boodle again this year.
 

Lefty smiled over this, his lips curling a bit
scornfully. The opening of the real baseball season
was yet a long distance away, but the newspaper
writers were compelled to grind out a required
amount of &#8220;dope&#8221; each day, and were
working hard to keep up their average. Some of
them were clever and ingenious in their phrasing,
but nearly all of them betrayed a lack of originality
or courage in forming and expressing individual
opinions. The Wolves had won the
pennant and the world&#8217;s championship last season,
and up to date they had been damaged less
than any club in organized ball by the raids of the
Federals; some wise pen pusher had therefore
predicted that the Wolves would cop the bunting
again, and was supported in this opinion by all
the little fellows, who ran, bleating, after the wise
one, like a flock of sheep chasing a bellwether.

171It was evident that, with no apparent exceptions,
this bleating flock looked on the Blue Stockings
as a drifting derelict that was due to be
blown up and sunk. For Locke they had only pity
and mild contempt because he had permitted himself
to be dragged into the impossible attempt to
salvage the worthless hulk. Even old Ben Frazer,
than whom none was reckoned more keen and
astute, had expressed such a sentiment without
concealment. A weak man would have felt some
qualms; Lefty felt none. He had not sought the
job; in a way, fate had thrust it upon him; and
now the more unsurmountable the difficulties appeared
the stronger he became to grapple with
them. Like a soldier going into battle, exulted
and fired by a high and lofty purpose, his heart
sang within him.

Before going to bed, Lefty had wired Kennedy
concerning the deal with Frazer, and he believed
Skullen had made haste to telegraph Weegman.
He rose in the morning fully expecting to get a
red-hot message from Collier&#8217;s private secretary,
and was surprised when nothing of the sort
reached him. While at breakfast, however, he received
an answer from old Jack:


Good work! Congratulations. Keep it up.
Kennedy.
 

172Weegman&#8217;s silence led Locke to do some thinking,
and suddenly he understood. Skullen had
discovered him on the Knickerbocker Special just
before the train had pulled into Albany, and immediately
Mit had hastened away to buy a paper.
Of course he had then sent word to Weegman,
who was now on his way to New York.

&#8220;But he can&#8217;t get here before six o&#8217;clock to-night,&#8221;
thought Lefty, &#8220;and my train for the
South leaves at three-thirty-four.&#8221;

He did not relish running away from Weegman,
and it had gone against the grain when, upon
the advice of Kennedy, he had suddenly left Indianapolis.
But he knew old Jack was wise, and
the more he could accomplish without being interfered
with by the rascal he despised, the stronger
his position for open fighting would be when it
became necessary to defy him to his face.

His first duty that day was to visit his parents,
and, shortly after breakfast, he took the tube for
Jersey. Less than an hour&#8217;s journey brought him
to the Hazelton home, and, after something like
an hour spent with them, he left them in a much
more cheerful and hopeful frame of mind.

On returning to the city he called up the office
of Franklin Parlmee. To his disappointment, he
was informed that Parlmee had not returned since
leaving for Indianapolis. He had expected the
173
man could inform him whether or not Virginia
Collier was in New York, and, if she were, how to
find her and obtain the brief interview he desired.
For he was sure that a short talk with Charles
Collier&#8217;s daughter would serve to clear away many
of the uncertainties with which he was surrounded.

But there were other things to be done, and
Lefty was kept on the jump, without time, even,
to snatch a hasty lunch. When a person attempts
to accomplish a great deal in a brief period in New
York, he often finds he has shouldered a heavy
load. By two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon he realized
that it would be impossible for him to take the
three-thirty-four southbound from the Pennsylvania
Station. There was a slower train leaving
at nine-thirty; that was the best he could do.

He believed Weegman would rush to the Great
Eastern as soon as he arrived. Locke had left
the Great Eastern, and there was little chance of
encountering the man elsewhere. Once or twice
he thought of Skullen, and wondered if he had
made an effort to keep track of him.

&#8220;If so,&#8221; laughed the southpaw, &#8220;he has been
some busy person.&#8221;

At six o&#8217;clock he was appeasing a ravenous appetite
in a quiet restaurant. With the exception
of the fact that he had not been able to find Virginia
Collier, he had done everything he had set
174
out to do. And he had wired Cap&#8217;n Wiley that he
would soon be on his way with a Blue Stockings
contract for Mysterious Jones to sign.

In order to pass the time and obtain a little
diversion, he went to a motion-picture show after
dinner, having first secured accommodations on
the train, and checked his bag at the station. He
left the theater shortly before nine o&#8217;clock, and
had reached Broadway and Thirty-third Street,
when a lighted limousine, containing two persons
besides the driver, drove past him. He obtained
a good look at both passengers, a man, who was
talking earnestly, and a woman, smiling as she
listened. He knew he was not mistaken this time:
the man was Bailey Weegman; the woman was
Virginia Collier.


175CHAPTER XXA RIDDLE TO SOLVE

Locke stood still, staring after the swiftly
receding car. He thought of pursuit, but,
as a heavy rain was falling, there was no
available taxi in the immediate vicinity. By the
time he could secure one the limousine would have
vanished, leaving no possible hope of tracing it.

Weegman and Virginia Collier together and on
terms plainly more than usually friendly! What
was the explanation? She had arrived in New
York, after all, and it was apparent that Weegman
knew where to find her when he reached the city.
That his company was distinctly agreeable to her
was evident from the fleeting glimpse Lefty had
obtained. As Parlmee&#8217;s rival, the man held the
favor of Charles Collier. Had the baseball magnate
at last succeeded in breaking down the prejudice
and opposition of his daughter? Was it possible
that Weegman, not Parlmee, was the magnet
that had drawn the girl back from Europe?

&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; exclaimed Lefty. &#8220;She&#8217;d never
throw over Frank for that chuckling scoundrel.&#8221;

But was it impossible? Vaguely he recalled
176
something like a change in the tone of Virginia&#8217;s
last letters to Janet; somehow they had not seemed
as frank and confiding as former letters. And
eventually, to Janet&#8217;s worriment and perplexity,
Virginia had ceased to write at all.

Before Locke flashed a picture of Parlmee as
he had appeared in Indianapolis, nervous, perplexed,
and, by his own admission, greatly worried.
Parlmee had confessed that he had received
only two very unsatisfactory letters from Virginia
since she had sailed for Europe with her father,
and more than a month had elapsed since the second
of these had come to his hands. Of itself,
this was enough to upset a man as much in love
with Miss Collier as Parlmee undoubtedly was.
But, at the time, Lefty had vaguely felt that the
automobile salesman was holding something back,
and now he was sure. Parlmee&#8217;s pride, and his
secret hope that he was mistaken, had prevented
him from confessing that the girl had changed in
her attitude toward him.

True, Virginia had cabled that she was sailing
on the Victoria, and had asked him to meet her,
and although she had not sailed on that ship, yet
she was now in New York. Here was a riddle to
solve. Did the solution lie in the assumption that,
having decided to break her tentative engagement
in a face-to-face talk with Parlmee, the girl&#8217;s courage
177
had failed her, leading her to change her
plans? The fact that he was with her now seemed
to prove that Weegman&#8217;s information regarding
her movements and intentions had been more accurate
than Parlmee&#8217;s.

It did not appear plausible that such a girl
could be persuaded, of her own free will, to throw
over Franklin Parlmee for Bailey Weegman.
But perhaps she was not exercising her own free
will; perhaps some powerful and mastering influence
had been brought to bear upon her. Was
it not possible, also, that her father, whose singular
behavior had lately aroused comment and
speculation, was likewise a victim of this mastering
influence? While the idea was a trifle bizarre,
and savored of sensational fiction, such things did
happen, if reports of them, to be found almost
daily in the newspapers, could be believed. But
when Locke tried to imagine the chuckling and oily
Weegman as a hypnotist, dominating both Collier
and his daughter by the power of an evil spell, he
failed. It was too preposterous.

One thing, however, was certain: evil powers of
a materialistic nature were at work, and they had
succeeded in making a decided mess of Charles
Collier&#8217;s affairs. To defeat them, the strategy
and determination of united opposition would be
required, and, in view of the task, the opposition
178
seemed weak and insufficient. Even Parlmee, who
might render some aid, was not to be reached. He
had obtained a month&#8217;s leave from business in
order to settle his own suspicions and fears, but
he had not returned to New York. Where was
he?

Lefty glanced over his shoulder as the Herald
clock began to hammer out the hour of nine.
Then he set his face westward and made for the
Pennsylvania Station at a brisk pace. Reaching
his destination, he wrote and sent to Parlmee&#8217;s
office address a message that contained, in addition
to the positive assurance that Virginia was
in town and had been seen with Weegman, a
statement of the southpaw&#8217;s suspicions, which
amounted almost to convictions, concerning the
whole affair. There didn&#8217;t seem to be much more
that he could do. He had secured his accommodations
on the Florida Mail, but he expected to
be back on the field of battle in the North within
the shortest possible time.

Before going aboard his train, he bought the
latest edition of an evening newspaper, and, naturally,
turned at once to the sporting page. Almost
by instinct his eyes found something of personal
concern, a statement that Manager Garrity
would strengthen the Rockets by securing an unknown
&#8220;dummy&#8221; pitcher who had been discovered
179
by Scout Skullen, and was said to be a wizard.
Skullen, it was intimated, was off with a commission
from Garrity to sign up his find.

There was no longer any doubt in Locke&#8217;s mind
that Skullen had watched the work of Mysterious
Jones, and intended to nail the mute for the
Rockets. Even now, he had departed on his mission.
Probably he had left at three-thirty-four on
the very train Lefty had meant to take. If so,
he would reach Florida many hours ahead of the
southpaw, and would have plenty of time to accomplish
his purpose. True, Locke had made a
fair and square bargain with Wiley and Jones,
but, having been unable to get Jones&#8217; signature
on a Blue Stockings contract at the time, the deal
would not be binding if the mute chose to go back
on it.

Not a little apprehensive, Lefty sent still another
message to Cap&#8217;n Wiley. After which he
went aboard the train, found his berth, and turned
in.


180CHAPTER XXITHE MAN AHEAD

Locke was the first passenger to leap off
the train when it stopped at Vienna. He
made for one of the two rickety carriages
that were drawn up beside the station platform.
The white-wooled old negro driver straightened
on his seat, signaling with his whip, and called:
&#8220;Right dis way, sah; dis way fo&#8217; the Lithonia
House.&#8221;

&#8220;Is there a baseball game in this town to-day,
uncle?&#8221; asked Lefty.

&#8220;Yes, sah, dere sho am. Dey&#8217;s gwine to be
some hot game, so ever&#8217;body say. Our boys gwine
buck up against dem Wind Jabbers, an&#8217; dere&#8217;ll be
a reg&#8217;ler ruction out to de pahk.&#8221;

&#8220;What time does the game begin?&#8221;

&#8220;Free o&#8217;clock am de skaduled hour fo&#8217; de
obsequies, sah. Dey&#8217;s out to de pahk now, sah,
an&#8217; &#8217;most ever&#8217;body could git dere has gone, too.&#8221;

Locke looked at his watch. &#8220;Thirty minutes
before the game starts. How far is your park?&#8221;

&#8220;&#8217;Bout a mile, sah, mo&#8217; uh less.&#8221;

181&#8220;Two dollars, if you get me there in a hurry.&#8221;

&#8220;Two dollahs, sah? Yes, sah! Step right in,
sah, an&#8217; watch dis heah streak o&#8217; locomotion
transpose yo&#8217; over de earth surface. Set tight
an&#8217; hol&#8217; fast.&#8221;

Tossing his overcoat and bag into the rear of
the carriage, Lefty sprang in. The old negro
gave a shrill yell, and cracked his whip with a
pistol-like report. The yell and the crack electrified
the rawboned old nag into making a wild leap
as if trying to jump out of the thills. It was a
marvel that the spliced and string-tied harness
held. The southpaw was flung down upon the
rear seat, and it was a wonder that he did not go
flying over the low back of it and out of the carriage.
He grabbed hold with both hands, and
held fast. Round the corner of the station spun
the carriage on two wabbly wheels, and away it
careened at the heels of the galloping horse, the
colored driver continuing to yell and crack his
whip. Two dollars!

The ride from the station to the baseball park
was brief but exciting. The distance could not
have been more than half a mile, and, considering
the conveyance, it was made in record time.

&#8220;Whoa, yo&#8217; Nancy Hanks!&#8221; shouted the driver,
surging back on the reins and stopping the animal
so abruptly that Lefty was nearly pitched into the
182
forward seat. &#8220;Did I heah yo&#8217; say you wanted
to git heah in a hurry, sah?&#8221;

Locke jumped out. &#8220;That&#8217;s the shortest mile
I ever traveled,&#8221; he said, handing over the price
promised. &#8220;But then, when it comes to driving,
Barney Oldfield has nothing on you.&#8221;

Carrying his overcoat and bag, he hurried to
the gate and paid the price of admission. A
goodly crowd had gathered, and the local team
was practicing on the field. Over at one side some
of the visitors were getting in a little light batting
practice. Mysterious Jones was warming up
with Schaeffer. A short distance behind Jones
stood Cap&#8217;n Wiley, his legs planted wide, his arms
folded, his ear cocked, listening to Mit Skullen,
who was talking earnestly. Lefty strode hastily
toward the pair.

&#8220;Sell him!&#8221; said the Marine Marvel, in reply
to the scout, as the southpaw approached behind
them. &#8220;Of course I will. But you made one miscue,
mate; you should have come straight to me
in the first place, instead of superflouing away
your time seeking to pilfer him off me by stealth.
What price do you respectfully tender?&#8221;

Locke felt a throb of resentful anger. Regardless
of a square bargain already made, Wiley was
ready to negotiate with Skullen. However, Mit
183
had not yet succeeded in his purpose, and the
southpaw was on hand to maintain a prior claim.
Involuntarily he halted, waiting for the scout&#8217;s
offer.

&#8220;As you aren&#8217;t in any regular league,&#8221; said Mit,
&#8220;by rights I don&#8217;t have to give you anything for
him; but if you&#8217;ll jolly him into putting his fist
to a contract, I&#8217;ll fork over fifty bones out of my
own pocket. Garrity won&#8217;t stand for it, so I&#8217;ll
have to come through with the fifty myself.&#8221;

&#8220;Your magnanimous offer staggers me!&#8221; exclaimed
Wiley. &#8220;Allow me a moment to subdue
my emotions. However and nevertheless, I fear
me greatly that my bottom price would be slightly
more than that.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, what is your bottom price?&#8221; demanded
Skullen. &#8220;Put it down to the last notch.&#8221;

&#8220;I will. I&#8217;ll give you bed-rock figures. Comprehend
me, mate, I&#8217;ll pare it right down to the
bone, and you can&#8217;t buy Jones a measly, lonesome
cent less. I&#8217;ll sell him to you for just precisely
fifty thousand dollars.&#8221;

The scout&#8217;s jaw dropped, and he stared at the
little man, who stared up at him in return, one
eyelid slightly lowered, an oddly provocative expression
on his swarthy face.

Slowly the look of incredulous disbelief turned
184
to wrath. The purple color surged upward from
Mit&#8217;s bull neck into his scarred face; his huge
hands closed.

&#8220;What are you trying to hand me, you blamed
little runt?&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the joke?&#8221;

&#8220;No joke at all, I hasten to postulate,&#8221; said
Wiley. &#8220;The scandalous fact is that I couldn&#8217;t
sell him to you at all without scuttling and sinking
my sacred honor. But human nature is frail
and prone to temptation, and for the sum of fifty
thousand dollars I&#8217;d inveigle Jones into signing
with you, even though never again as long as I
should dwell on this terrestrial sphere could I look
my old college chump, Lefty Locke, in the countenance.&#8221;

Skullen&#8217;s astonishment was a sight to behold.
He made strange, wheezing, gurgling sounds in his
throat. Presently one of his paws shot out and
fastened on Cap&#8217;n Wiley&#8217;s shoulder.

&#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;re saying about Lefty
Locke?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;What are you giving
me?&#8221;

&#8220;Straight goods, Mit,&#8221; stated the southpaw
serenely, as he stepped forward. &#8220;Too bad you
wasted so much time making a long and useless
trip.&#8221;

Skullen came round with something like his old
deftness of whirling in the ring when engaged in
185
battle. Never in all his life had his battered face
worn an uglier look. For a moment, however, he
seemed to doubt the evidence of his eyes.

&#8220;Locke!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Here!&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; returned the new manager of
the Blue Stockings pleasantly. &#8220;I reckoned you
would be ahead of me, Mit; but, as a man of his
word, Wiley couldn&#8217;t do business with you. And
without his aid there was little chance for you to
make arrangements with Jones.&#8221;

Skullen planted his clenched fists upon his hips
and gazed at the southpaw with an expression of
unrepressed hatred. His bearing, as well as his
look, threatened assault. Lefty dropped his traveling
bag to the ground, and tossed the overcoat
he had been compelled to wear in the North upon
it. He felt that it would be wise for him to have
both hands free and ready for use.


186CHAPTER XXIIA DOUBTFUL VICTORY

&#8220;Who sent you here?&#8221; demanded the
belligerent individual. &#8220;What business
have you got coming poking
your nose into my affairs? You&#8217;d better chase
yourself sudden.&#8221;

Instead of exhibiting alarm, Lefty laughed in
the man&#8217;s face. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make a show of yourself,
Mit,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;Bluster won&#8217;t get you any
ball players; at least, it won&#8217;t get you this one.
I&#8217;ve already made a deal for Jones.&#8221;

&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got his name on a contract; you
hadn&#8217;t time. If you had, Wiley&#8217;d told me.&#8221;

&#8220;I made a fair trade for him before I went
North.&#8221;

Into Skullen&#8217;s eyes there came a look of understanding
and satisfaction. His lips curled back
from his ugly teeth.

&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have any authority to make a trade
then, for you weren&#8217;t manager of the Stockings.
You can&#8217;t put anything like that over on me. If
you don&#8217;t chase yourself, I&#8217;ll throw you over the
fence.&#8221;

187Sensing an impending clash, with the exception
of the mute and the catcher, the Wind Jammers
ceased their desultory practice and watched for
developments. A portion of the spectators, also
becoming aware that something unusual was taking
place, turned their attention to the little triangular
group not far from the visitors&#8217; bench.

&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t get Jones if you threw me over
into Georgia,&#8221; said Locke, unruffled. &#8220;It won&#8217;t
do you any good to start a scrap.&#8221;

&#8220;Permit me to impersonate the dove of peace,&#8221;
pleaded Cap&#8217;n Wiley. &#8220;Lefty is absolutely
voracious in his statement that he made a fair and
honorable compact with me, by which Jones is to
become the legitimate chattel of the Blue Stockings.
Still,&#8221; he added, shaking his head and licking
his lips, &#8220;flesh is weak and liable to err. If I
had seen fifty thousand simoleons coming my way
in exchange for the greatest pitcher of modern
times, I&#8217;m afraid I should have lacked the energy
to side-step them. The root of all evil has sometimes
tempted me from the path of rectitude.
But now Lefty is here, and the danger is over.
It&#8217;s no use, Skully, old top; the die is cast. You
may as well submit gracefully to the inveterable.&#8221;

Muttering inaudibly, Skullen turned and walked
away.

&#8220;I have a contract in my pocket ready for the
188
signature of Jones,&#8221; said Lefty. &#8220;Will you get
him to put his name to it before the game starts?&#8221;

&#8220;It will give me a pang of pleasure to do so,&#8221;
was the assurance.

There on the field, envied by his teammates,
Mysterious Jones used Locke&#8217;s fountain pen to
place his signature&#8211;A. B. Jones was the name he
wrote&#8211;upon the contract that bound him to the
Blue Stockings. What the initials stood for not
even Wiley knew. For a moment the mute seemed
to hesitate, but the Marine Marvel urged him on,
and the deed was done.

&#8220;If you cater to his little giddyocyncracies,&#8221;
said the sailor, &#8220;you&#8217;ll find him a pearl beyond
price. Unless you&#8217;re afraid Skully may return
and mar your pleasure, you may sit on the bench
with us and watch him toy with the local bric-a-brac.
It is bound to be a painfully one-sided
affair.&#8221;

&#8220;Skullen,&#8221; laughed Lefty, &#8220;has ceased to cause
me special apprehension. The contract is signed
now.&#8221;

So Locke sat on the bench and watched his new
pitcher perform. When he walked to the mound,
Jones seemed, if possible, more somber and tragic
than usual, and he certainly had his speed with
him. Yet neither the ominous appearance of the
mute nor his blinding smoke was sufficient to faze
189
the Vienna batters, who cracked him for three
clean singles in the last half of the opening inning,
and then failed to score because of foolish
base running.

&#8220;He seems to be rather hittable to-day,&#8221; observed
Locke. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Wiley? This
Vienna bunch doesn&#8217;t look particularly good to
me; just a lot of amateurs who never saw real
players, I should say.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s it; that&#8217;s what ails them, for one
thing,&#8221; replied the manager of the Wind Jammers.
&#8220;They have accumulated together no
special knowledge of Simon poor baseball talent,
and so they don&#8217;t know enough to be scared.
Even the great Mathewson has confessed that
the worst bumping he ever collided with was
handed out by a bunch of bushers who stood up
to the dish, shut their blinkers when he pitched,
and swung blind at the pill. These lobsters don&#8217;t
realize that Jonesy&#8217;s fast one would pass right
through a batter without pausing perceptibly if it
should hit him, and so they toddle forth without
qualms, whatever they are, and take a slam at the
globule. Next round I&#8217;ll have to get out there on
the turf and warn them; I&#8217;ll put the fear of death
into their hearts. Get them to quaking and they
won&#8217;t touch the horsehide.&#8221;

But such a program didn&#8217;t suit Locke. &#8220;If
190
all Jones has is his speed and the fear it inspires,
he won&#8217;t travel far in fast company. You ought
to know that, Wiley. Big League batters will
knock the cover off the fast one unless a pitcher
puts something else on it. Sit still once, to please
me, and let&#8217;s see what Jones can do without the
assistance of your chatter.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s hardly a square deal,&#8221; objected the Marine
Marvel. &#8220;The jinx has been keeping company
with us ever since we struck Fernandon. From
that occasion up to the present date, Anno Domino,
we haven&#8217;t won a single consecutive game. Such
bad luck has hurt my feelings; it has grieved me
to the innermost abscess of my soul.&#8221;

&#8220;Do you mean to say that these country teams
have been trimming you, with Jones in the box?&#8221;

&#8220;Alas and alack! I can&#8217;t deny it unless I resort
to fabrication, which I never do. The Euray
Browns tapped Jonesy for seventeen heart-breaking
bingles, and the Pikeville Greyhounds lacerated
his delivery even more painfully. My own
brilliant work in the box has been sadly insufficient
to stem, the tide of disaster.&#8221;

Locke frowned. What success, or lack of it,
Wiley had had as a pitcher was a matter of no moment;
but the statement that amateur teams of no
particular standing had found Mysterious Jones
an easy mark was disturbing. Was it possible
191
that he had been led, with undue haste, to fritter
away good money for a pitcher who would prove
worthless in the Big League? True, the mute had
seemed to show something in the Fernandon game,
but in similar contests Lefty had seen many a pinheaded,
worthless country pitcher give a fine imitation
of Walter Johnson in top-notch form. The
test of the bush was, in reality, no test at all.

Throughout five innings the southpaw succeeded
in restraining Wiley, and during that portion of
the game the Viennas found Jones for nine singles
and two doubles, accumulating four runs.
Only for bad judgment on the paths they might
have secured twice as many tallies. In the same
period the local pitcher, using a little dinky slow
curve, held the visitors to one score. The mute
seemed to be trying hard enough, but he could
not keep his opponents from hitting.

With the opening of the sixth, Wiley broke the
leash of restraint. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get out and get
under,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;You can&#8217;t expect me to sit
still and watch my barkentine go upon the rocks.
Here&#8217;s where we start something. Get into &#8217;em,
Schepps! Begin doing things! We&#8217;ll back you
up, for in onion there is strength.&#8221;

Schepps led off with a hit, and immediately the
Wind Jammers, encouraged by Wiley, leaped out
from the bench, dancing wildly and tossing the
192
bats into the air. Locke smiled as he watched
them. He had seen Big League teams do the same
thing in an effort to drive away the jinx and break
a streak of bad luck. But although Lefty smiled,
he was not wholly happy.

&#8220;If Jones is a quince,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
wasted my time trying to brace up our pitching
staff. Even Mit Skullen will have the laugh on
me.&#8221;

His anxiety had led him to come straight from
New York to Vienna, without stopping at Fernandon.
He had sent a message to Janet telling her
that he would be home the following day.

The Wind Jammers kept after the local twirler,
and succeeded in pounding two men round to the
registry station. Then Wiley did some wigwagging
to Jones, and the gloomy mute nodded assurance.
After which he walked out and fanned
three batters in a row.

&#8220;You see, Lefty!&#8221; exulted the Marine Marvel.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what he needs. Give him proper encouragement,
and he&#8217;s there with the damsons.&#8221;

&#8220;Temperamental or yellow, which?&#8221; speculated
the southpaw. &#8220;Either sort of a pitcher is worthless
in pinches.&#8221;

The visitors failed to continue their hitting
streak in the seventh. Whether or not Jones was
disheartened by this, he let down in the last half
193
of the inning, and Vienna added another score,
Wiley&#8217;s warnings having no impression upon
them. Nor did the mute show any remarkable
form in the remainder of the game, which terminated
with the score six to four in favor of the
locals.

&#8220;The old jinx is still with us,&#8221; lamented the dejected
manager of the Wind Jammers. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t
it congeal your pedal extremities!&#8221;

&#8220;It is enough to give one cold feet,&#8221; admitted
Locke. &#8220;But with Jones doing any real pitching
to-day four tallies would have been sufficient for
you.&#8221;

Picking up his overcoat and traveling bag, he
started to follow the well-satisfied crowd from the
field. As he approached the gate, Mit Skullen
stood up on the bleachers and singled him out.
Mit&#8217;s face wore a leering grin.

&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to that lemon, Locke!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t take him now for a gift.
You&#8217;ve got stung good and proper.&#8221;

Lefty walked on without replying.


194CHAPTER XXIIIALL WRONG

When Locke reached Fernandon, he
found, as he expected, a furious message
from Weegman awaiting him.
In it he was savagely reprimanded, and warned
under no circumstances to make any further deals
without consulting Collier&#8217;s private secretary.
He was also commanded to report at the office of
the Blue Stockings baseball club without unnecessary
delay.

Lefty merely smiled over this, but he did not
smile over a long telegram from Franklin Parlmee,
stating that he had not seen Virginia Collier nor
heard anything further from her. Parlmee
averred that he could not believe Virginia was in
New York; he expressed the conviction that Locke
had not seen her in the limousine with Bailey
Weegman, but had been deceived by a resemblance.
But if she were not in New York, where
was she? And why had he received no word from
her?

Janet watched Lefty frowning and biting his
195
lip over Parlmee&#8217;s message. Her own face
showed the anxiety she felt.

&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t
seem possible that Virginia could have been with
that man, as you thought. You must have been
mistaken.&#8221;

He shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m positive, Janet. I
would be willing to wager anything that I made
no mistake.&#8221;

&#8220;Then what does it mean? I can&#8217;t imagine
Virginia being in New York without letting Frank
know.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s got me guessing,&#8221; Locke admitted.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a snarl that needs to be untangled.&#8221;

She grabbed his arm. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;What?&#8221; he asked, as she hesitated.

&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose anything terrible could
have happened to Virginia? Perhaps that villain
has carried her off&#8211;shut her up somewhere!
Perhaps she is helpless in his power this minute.
He may be trying to force her into marrying him.&#8221;

Lefty laughed. &#8220;That sounds too much like a
dime novel, my dear. Scoundrel though he is,
Weegman would scarcely have the nerve to try
anything like that with the daughter of Charles
Collier. That&#8217;s not the answer.&#8221;

&#8220;But something&#8217;s wrong,&#8221; insisted Janet.

&#8220;No doubt about that,&#8221; her husband replied.
196
&#8220;A lot of things seem to be wrong. Somebody is
dealing the cards under the table.&#8221;

&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Janet, &#8220;that Virginia didn&#8217;t
care for Mr. Weegman, and the more her father
sought to influence her the less she thought of him.
She was proud of Franklin because he had proved
his business ability, and she thought Mr. Collier
would give in soon. But I can&#8217;t understand why
she stopped writing to me. She hasn&#8217;t written
since arriving on this side.&#8221;

&#8220;We&#8217;re not getting anywhere by speculating
like this,&#8221; said Lefty. &#8220;Can you be ready to go
North with me to-morrow?&#8221;

&#8220;You are going back so soon?&#8221;

&#8220;Just as soon as we can start. I&#8217;m thinking I
ought to have remained there. I only came South
at all in order to make sure of Mysterious Jones,
and now it looks as though I wasted both time and
money by doing so. Perhaps I would have been
better off if Skullen had succeeded in getting
Jones away from me.&#8221;

&#8220;But the cottage&#8211;our lease runs another full
month.&#8221;

&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped. We&#8217;ll have to pay the
rental and give it up.&#8221;

&#8220;And your arm&#8211;you thought another month
down here might give you time to work it back
into condition.&#8221;

197&#8220;I&#8217;ve got plenty to worry about besides my arm.
I&#8217;ve been told plainly that I&#8217;ve been picked to be
the goat by a set of scoundrels who are trying to
put over a dirty piece of work, and, if I fool them,
I&#8217;ll have to do it with my head, not my arm. I&#8217;m
going to stake everything on my ability to put the
kibosh on their crooked game, and to stand any
chance of succeeding I must be on the field of battle.
So we must leave Fernandon to-morrow, my
dear.&#8221;

To accomplish this necessitated no small
amount of hustling, but Janet did her part. With
the assistance of her maid and a colored man, the
work was speedily done. There were tears in
Janet&#8217;s eyes when she looked back at the deserted
little cottage, as they drove away in a carriage to
catch the train.

&#8220;It has been pleasant here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
never forget it. We were so quiet and so happy.
Now, somehow, I have a feeling that there&#8217;s nothing
but trouble ahead of us. You&#8217;ve taken a big
contract, Phil.&#8221;

&#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221; he asked.

She looked up at him and smiled proudly. &#8220;Not
a bit. You are not the sort of man who fails. I
know you&#8217;ll win out.&#8221;

His cheeks glowed and a light leaped into his
eyes. &#8220;After hearing you say that, I couldn&#8217;t
198
fail, Janet, dear,&#8221; he said quietly but earnestly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be some fight, but let it come&#8211;I&#8217;m
ready.&#8221;

The journey northward was uneventful. Locke
had wired both Kennedy and Parlmee when he
would arrive in New York, asking them to meet
him at the Great Eastern. He did not stop off at
the home town of the Blue Stockings, choosing to
disregard for the present Weegman&#8217;s imperative
order for him to report at once at the office of
the club. By mail he had formally notified the
secretary of the club of the trade with Frazer and
the purchase of Mysterious Jones, directing that
checks be sent immediately to the manager of the
Wolves and to Cap&#8217;n Wiley. He had done this as
a matter of formality, but he felt sure that Weegman
would interfere and hold up the payments,
even though they could, sooner or later, be legally
enforced. Delay matters as he might, the rascal
could not bring about the repudiation of business
deals entered into by the properly authorized manager
of the team. Locke hoped to have the situation
well in hand before he should find it necessary
to beard the lion in all his fury. The showdown
must come before long, but ere that time the
southpaw hoped to fill his hand on the draw.

When he had sent out the players&#8217; contracts
from Indianapolis he had instructed the men, after
199
signing, to mail them directly to him in New York.
He had made this request emphatic, warning each
man not to return his signed contract to the office
of the Blue Stockings. He had Kennedy to thank
for suggesting this procedure.

&#8220;If the contracts go back to the club office,&#8221;
old Jack had said, &#8220;Weegman may get hold of
them and hold out on you. That would leave you
in the dark; you wouldn&#8217;t know who had signed up
and who hadn&#8217;t, and so you couldn&#8217;t tell where
you stood. It would keep you muddled so you
wouldn&#8217;t know what holes were left to be plugged.
If you undertook to find out how the land lay by
wiring inquiries to the players, you&#8217;d make them
uneasy, and set them wondering what was doing.
Some of them might even try belated dickering
with the Feds, and, while you could hold them by
law, it would complicate things still more. If the
newspapers got wise and printed things, the stock
of the club would slump still more, which would
help the dirty bunch that&#8217;s trying to knock the
bottom out of it.&#8221;

Beyond question, Kennedy was foxy and farseeing,
and Locke looked forward expectantly to
another heart-to-heart talk with the old man at the
Great Eastern.

A big bundle of mail was delivered to Lefty
after he registered at the hotel. Immediately on
200
reaching his rooms he made haste to open the letters.

&#8220;Look, Janet!&#8221; he cried exultantly, after he had
torn open envelope after envelope. &#8220;Here are the
contracts&#8211;Grant, Welsh, Hyland, Savage, Dillon,
Reilley, and Lumley all have signed, as well as the
youngsters who didn&#8217;t attract special attention
from the Feds. Not a man lost that the outlaws
hadn&#8217;t gobbled up before Weegman so kindly
forced the management upon me. We&#8217;ve got the
makings of a real team left. Some of the deadwood
has been cleared away, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;

With scarcely an exception, the players had
sent, along with their contracts, brief, friendly
letters congratulating Locke and expressing confidence
in his ability to manage the Blue Stockings
successfully. He had won the regard of them
all; in some cases that regard fell little short of
genuine affection. With him as their leader they
would fight with fresh spirit and loyalty.

&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, Lefty!&#8221; exclaimed Janet, as she read
some of those cheery letters. &#8220;There was a time
when I could not have believed professional ball
players were such a fine lot of men.&#8221;

&#8220;I might have had some doubts myself before I
was associated with them,&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;but experience
has taught me that they measure up in
201
manhood as well as any other class. Of course,
black sheep may be found in every business.&#8221;

As he spoke, he hurriedly opened a letter that
had just attracted his attention among those remaining.
He read it aloud:


My Dear Hazelton: I am writing in haste before sailing
for Liverpool on the Northumberland. As I thought, you
were wrong about having seen Virginia in New York. She is
in London, and in trouble. I&#8217;ve had a cablegram from her
which, however, explains very little. She needs me, and I am
going to her at once. If you should wish to communicate with
me, my address will be the Cecil. As I know that both you
and Mrs. Hazelton feel some anxiety about Virginia, I shall
let you hear from me as soon as I have any news.

Wishing you the success and good fortune you deserve as
a baseball manager, I remain, sincerely yours,
Franklin Parlmee.
 

When he had finished reading, he stood staring
at the letter in surprise.


202CHAPTER XXIVWHEELS WITHIN WHEELS

&#8220;Well, now, what do you know about
that?&#8221; cried Lefty. &#8220;Sailed for
Liverpool! The man&#8217;s crazy!&#8221;

&#8220;But he says he has had a cable message from
Virginia,&#8221; said Janet. &#8220;She is in trouble in London.
You were mistaken.&#8221;

&#8220;Was I?&#8221; queried the southpaw, as if not yet
convinced.

&#8220;You must have been. All along I have thought
it likely, but you persisted&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;I saw her distinctly in that passing limousine,
which was brightly lighted. True, I obtained only
one passing glance at her, but it was enough to
satisfy me.&#8221;

&#8220;You are so persistent, Phil! That&#8217;s your one
fault; when you think you&#8217;re right, all the argument
and proof in the world cannot change you.&#8221;

&#8220;In short, I&#8217;m set as a mule,&#8221; he admitted,
smiling. &#8220;Well, there are worse faults. A mistake
may prove costly or humiliating to an obstinate
person who persists in his error, but, when
he is right, such a person is pretty well qualified
203
to win over all opposition. If I did not see Virginia
Collier in that car, she has a perfect double
in New York. I have great confidence in the reliability
of my eyes.&#8221;

Janet, however, thoroughly convinced that her
husband had been deceived by a resemblance, made
no reply.

Lefty had looked for some word from Kennedy,
but had found nothing from him in his bundle of
mail. It was possible, of course, that old Jack
had found it inconvenient to make the trip to New
York just then; but, naturally, if he could not
come on he would have let Locke know.

Lefty and Janet had not dined on the train,
preferring to do so after reaching their destination.
As they were passing the desk on their way
to the dining room, Locke stopped short, staring
at the back of a slender, well-dressed young man
who was talking to one of the clerks. Then the
southpaw sprang forward and clapped a hand on
the young man&#8217;s shoulder.

&#8220;Jack Stillman!&#8221; he exclaimed impulsively.

The man turned quickly.

&#8220;If it isn&#8217;t Lefty Locke!&#8221; he cried, grabbing
the pitcher&#8217;s hand. &#8220;And you&#8217;re the one man I&#8217;ve
been palpitating to get hold of. You&#8217;re like the
nimble flea. But I&#8217;ve got you now!&#8221;

&#8220;Murder!&#8221; said the southpaw. &#8220;My joy at
204
spotting you caused me to forget. I should have
passed you by, old man. For the moment I completely
forgot your profession, and your knack of
digging a column or so of sacred secrets out of
any old ball player who knows anything he
shouldn&#8217;t tell.&#8221;

Stillman was the baseball man of the Blade, a
newspaper with a confirmed habit of putting over
scoops. With the exception of Phil Chatterton,
who was more of a special writer than reporter,
Stillman was almost universally acknowledged to
be the best informed pen pusher who made a specialty
of dealing with the national game. He possessed
an almost uncanny intuition, and was credited
with the faculty of getting wise in advance to
most of the big happenings in the baseball world.

&#8220;So you would have ducked me, would you?&#8221;
said the reporter reprovingly. &#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t
think that of you!&#8221;

&#8220;I believe I should, if I&#8217;d stopped to figure out
the proper play in advance,&#8221; confessed Lefty.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to do much talking for the papers&#8211;at
present.&#8221;

&#8220;Hang you for an ungrateful reprobate!&#8221; exclaimed
Stillman, with a touch of earnestness, although
he continued to laugh. &#8220;Why, I made you,
son! At least, I&#8217;m going to claim the credit.
When you first emerged from the tangled undergrowth
205
I picked you for a winner and persistently
boosted you. I gave you fifty thousand dollars&#8217;
worth of free advertising.&#8221;

&#8220;And made my path the harder to climb by getting
the fans keyed up to look for a full-fledged
wonder. After all that puffing, if I&#8217;d fallen down
in my first game, Rube Marquard&#8217;s year or two
of sojourning on the bench would have looked like
a brief breathing spell compared to what would
have probably happened to me.&#8221;

&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t fall down. I told them you
wouldn&#8217;t, and you didn&#8217;t. Let the other fellows
tout the failures; I pick the winners.&#8221;

&#8220;Modest as ever, I see,&#8221; said Locke. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
Mrs. Hazelton waiting. We&#8217;re just going to have
a late dinner. Won&#8217;t you join us?&#8221;

Janet knew Stillman well, and she shook hands
with him. &#8220;Mrs. Hazelton!&#8221; he said, smiling.
&#8220;By Jove! I looked round to see who you meant
when you said that, Lefty. Somehow I&#8217;ve never
yet quite got used to the fact that your honest-and-truly
name isn&#8217;t Locke. I&#8217;ll gladly join you
at dinner, but a cup of coffee is all I care for, as I
dined a little while ago. Shan&#8217;t want anything
more before two or three o&#8217;clock in the morning,
when I&#8217;m likely to stray into John&#8217;s, where the
night owls gather.&#8221;

When they had seated themselves at a table in
206
the almost deserted dining room, Lefty warned
Janet.

&#8220;Be careful what you say before him, my dear,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s looking for copy every minute
that he&#8217;s awake, and nobody knows when he
sleeps.&#8221;

Stillman became serious. &#8220;Locke,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never yet betrayed a confidence. Oh, yes,
I&#8217;m a reporter! But, all the same, I have a
method of getting my copy in a decent fashion.
My friends don&#8217;t have to be afraid of me, and
close up like clams; you should know that.&#8221;

&#8220;I do,&#8221; declared the southpaw promptly. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t think you were going to take me quite so
seriously. You have been a square friend to me,
Jack.&#8221;

&#8220;Then don&#8217;t be afraid to talk. I&#8217;ll publish only
what you&#8217;re willing I should. You can tell me
what that is. And if you&#8217;ve seen the Blade right
along you must be aware that it&#8217;s the one paper
that hasn&#8217;t taken a little poke at you since you
were tagged to manage the Blue Stockings.
Nevertheless, here to your face I&#8217;m going to say
that I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve bitten off more than you
can chew.&#8221;

Lefty shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;As to that,
time will tell. For once your judgment may be
at fault.&#8221;

207&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that you couldn&#8217;t manage the
team successfully if you were given a half-decent
show,&#8221; the reporter hastened to make clear. &#8220;I
think you could. But I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re going to
find yourself in a mess that no man living could
crawl out of with credit to himself.&#8221;

The southpaw gave the waiter the order. Then
he turned to Stillman.

&#8220;I thought I might hear something new from
you, Jack,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you&#8217;re singing the same
old song. To be frank with you, it&#8217;s getting a bit
tiresome. If I were dull enough not to know I&#8217;d
been picked for a fall guy, I could have obtained
an inkling of it from the newspapers. It&#8217;s plain
every baseball scribe knows the fact that there&#8217;s
a put-up job, although none of them has had the
nerve to come out flat and say so.&#8221;

&#8220;They&#8217;ve said all they really dared to&#8211;without
absolute proof of a conspiracy. If you know so
much, take my advice, hand me the proof, and give
me permission to publish it. But it must be real
proof.&#8221;

&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it yet. Perhaps, when the time
comes, I&#8217;ll pass you what you&#8217;re asking for. Just
now, considering your statement that you never
double cross a friend, I&#8217;m going to talk freely and
tell you how much I know.&#8221;

Sipping his coffee, Stillman listened to Locke&#8217;s
208
story. That there was sufficient interest in it the
attention of the reporter attested. Janet watched
the newspaper man closely, and once or twice she
caught the flicker of an incredulous smile that
passed over his face, giving her the impression
that Stillman had a notion that there were holes in
Lefty&#8217;s narrative.

&#8220;Do you mind if I smoke?&#8221; asked the reporter,
when dinner was over, and the dessert had been
placed on the table.

Having received Janet&#8217;s permission, Stillman lit
a cigarette, and for a few moments said nothing,
being apparently engrossed with his thoughts.

Presently he said: &#8220;I wonder.&#8221;

&#8220;Wonder what?&#8221; Lefty wanted to know.
&#8220;What I&#8217;ve told you is the straight fact. Weegman&#8217;s
the crook. Kennedy knew it. I knew it
when I took the position of manager. Garrity&#8217;s
behind Weegman. What ails Collier, and why
he was crazy enough to run away and bury himself
while his team was wrecked, is the unexplained
part of the mystery. But if we can block Weegman
we may be able to put the whole game on the
fritz.&#8221;

&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; repeated Stillman, letting the
smoke curl from his mouth.

Locke felt a touch of irritation. &#8220;What are you
209
wondering over? I&#8217;ve talked; now I&#8217;m ready to
listen.&#8221;

The reporter gave Locke a steady look. &#8220;Evidently
the possibility hasn&#8217;t occurred to you that
you may not even suspect the real crook who is at
the bottom of the affair.&#8221;

&#8220;Weegman conceived it,&#8221; replied Lefty. &#8220;He
knew Garrity&#8217;s reputation. He was sure Garrity
would jump at the chance to help, and to grab a fat
thing at the same time, by stepping in and gobbling
the Stockings when the moment came. Of course,
Weegman will get his, for without his undermining
work in our camp the thing couldn&#8217;t be pulled off.
And Weegman&#8217;s looking to cop the big chief&#8217;s
daughter when he gets the chief pinched just where
he wants him.&#8221;

&#8220;Wheels within wheels,&#8221; said Stillman, &#8220;and
Weegman only one of the smallest of them. He&#8217;s
one of those egotistical scoundrels who can easily
be flattered and fooled into doing scurvy work for
a keener mind.&#8221;

&#8220;You mean Garrity?&#8221;

&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking of him when I spoke.&#8221;

&#8220;Then who&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;I had a man named Parlmee in mind,&#8221; stated
the reporter.


210CHAPTER XXVHIDDEN TRACKS

His lips parted, his eyes wide and incredulous,
Locke sat up straight on his chair
and stared at Stillman. Janet, who had
been listening attentively, gave a little cry, and
leaned forward, one slim, protesting hand uplifted.
The reporter drew his case from his pocket and lit
another cigarette.

Presently Lefty found his voice. &#8220;You&#8217;re
crazy, Jack!&#8221; he declared resentfully.

&#8220;Am I?&#8221; inquired Stillman.

&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s impossible!&#8221; exclaimed Janet.

&#8220;Absolutely ridiculous!&#8221; affirmed the southpaw.

&#8220;Very likely it seems so to you both,&#8221; admitted
the newspaper man, his calm and confident manner
proclaiming his own settled conviction. &#8220;I
listened to Lefty&#8217;s story, and I know he&#8217;s wise to
only a small part of what&#8217;s been going on.&#8221;

&#8220;But Parlmee&#8211;Oh, it&#8217;s too preposterous!
For once in your career, at least, you&#8217;re way off
your trolley, Jack.&#8221;

&#8220;Prove it to me.&#8221;

211&#8220;Why, it isn&#8217;t necessary. Franklin Parlmee is
a white man, as square as there ever was, and as
honest as the day is long.&#8221;

&#8220;There are short days in midwinter.&#8221;

&#8220;But his object&#8211;he couldn&#8217;t have an object,
even if he were scoundrel enough to contemplate
such a thing.&#8221;

&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t he?&#8221; asked Stillman, in that odd,
enigmatical way of his. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;

&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s practically engaged to Virginia Collier.&#8221;

&#8220;But without the consent of her father.&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, but&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Bailey Weegman is said to have a great liking
for Miss Collier. It was your theory that part of
his object in seeking to wreck the Blue Stockings
was to get old man Collier in a tight place and
force his hand. Why couldn&#8217;t Parlmee make the
same sort of a play?&#8221;

The persistence of the reporter began to irritate
Locke, who felt his blood growing hot. Was his
life beginning to tell on Stillman? Was it possible
the pace he had traveled had begun to weaken
his naturally keen judgment?

&#8220;Even if Parlmee had conceived such a foolish
scheme, he was in no position to carry it out, Jack.
On the other hand, Weegman was. Furthermore,
it&#8217;s perfectly impossible to imagine Weegman acting
212
as the tool and assistant of his rival, whom he
hates bitterly. Forget it!&#8221;

Unmoved, Stillman shook his head. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I
say that Weegman was an egotistical dub, and an
easy mark? He is naturally a rascal, and he
thinks himself very clever, and so is just the sort
to fall for a still cleverer rascal.&#8221;

Janet&#8217;s cheeks were hot and her eyes full of resentful
anger. It was difficult for her to sit there
and hear Parlmee maligned, and she was confident
that that was what she was doing. She could not
remain quiet.

&#8220;I know Frank Parlmee, Mr. Stillman,&#8221; she asserted,
&#8220;and Lefty is right about him. There&#8217;s
not a squarer man living.&#8221;

&#8220;How is it possible for Parlmee to use Weegman
as a tool?&#8221; asked Locke.

&#8220;Through Garrity,&#8221; answered the reporter
without hesitation.

&#8220;But I don&#8217;t see&#8211;&#8221;

Stillman leaned forward. &#8220;Listen: I am not
at liberty to disclose the sources of my information,
but it has come to me that this idea of wrecking
the Blue Stockings originated in Parlmee&#8217;s
brain. He saw himself losing out in the fight for
Virginia Collier, and he became desperate. Conditions
were ripe. Collier had hit the toboggan,
financially and otherwise. A man of considerable
213
strength of will, he had begun to break down.
Parlmee knew of his plan to go abroad for his
health, and of the arrangement to leave Bailey
Weegman in charge of affairs. Collier had a
great deal of confidence in Weegman&#8217;s ability, and
this would now be put to the test. If Weegman
should make a grand failure, as Parlmee intended
he should, Collier would lose all faith in him; and
probably, in his disappointment, he would hand
him the g. b. That, above all things, was most
to be desired by Parlmee, as it would get out of
the way the rival who threatened to defeat him.
How to put the thing across was the question. I
am willing to give Parlmee the credit of a long-headed
piece of work. He knew Weegman must
be kept in the dark, must never be permitted to
suspect that he was being used as a tool by his
hated enemy.&#8221;

&#8220;It sounds altogether too impossible,&#8221; said
Locke. But, to his annoyance, in spite of his persistently
expressed faith, a shadowy uncertainty,
a tiny, nagging doubt, was creeping into his mind.
Stillman seemed so absolutely confident of his
ground.

&#8220;Through his long association with Miss Collier,&#8221;
the reporter pursued calmly, &#8220;Parlmee had
learned much about inside conditions in baseball.
He had plenty of opportunities to get at things
214
entirely hidden from, or merely suspected by, the
general public. He knew Garrity was a grasping
scoundrel, who had long regarded the Blue Stockings
with a covetous eye, and that, being utterly
unscrupulous, he would do anything, as long as he
could keep in the background, to break Collier&#8217;s
grip and get his own soiled paws on the property.
Therefore, Garrity was the man to deal with, and
to Garrity Parlmee went. They met under cover
in Chicago, and the deal was fixed up between them.
Then Garrity got at Weegman, the real stool
pigeon and the fall guy of the whole plot.&#8221;

Locke was listening without protest now. In
spite of his desire not to believe, Stillman&#8217;s theory
seemed possible; he would not yet admit, even to
himself, that it was probable. Janet, too, was
silent. The color had left her face, and beneath
the table her hands were tightly clenched.

&#8220;Weegman was just ass enough to fall for it,&#8221;
continued Stillman contemptuously. &#8220;What Garrity
promised him I can&#8217;t say, but certainly it must
have been a satisfactory percentage of the loot&#8211;maybe
an interest in the team when Garrity got
control; and Weegman would sell his soul for
money. The moment Collier was out of the way
he got to work. You know as well as I do what
success he&#8217;s had. In order to cover his tracks as
215
far as possible, he has picked you for the goat,
and he&#8217;ll try to shunt all the blame on you.&#8221;

Lefty&#8217;s face was grim. He was endeavoring to
look at the matter fairly and without bias. To
himself he was compelled to admit that his knowledge
of Parlmee had been obtained through casual
association with the man, not through business
dealings, and in no small degree, he, as well as
Janet, had doubtless been influenced by the sentiments
of Virginia Collier. A girl in love may be
easily deceived; many girls, blinded by their own
infatuation, have made heroes of thoroughbred
scoundrels. It was practically impossible, however,
for Locke to picture Parlmee as a scoundrel.

&#8220;You have made a statement, Jack,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;without offering a particle of corroborating
proof. How do you know all this to be true?&#8221;

&#8220;I have the word of a man I trust that Parlmee
and Garrity had that secret meeting in Chicago,
just as I have stated. A few days ago Parlmee
made a flying trip to Indianapolis, and&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;I know that,&#8221; interrupted Lefty. &#8220;I was in
Indianapolis at the time. I met him there and
had a brief talk with him.&#8221;

&#8220;On his way back,&#8221; resumed Stillman, &#8220;he
stopped off at Cleveland to see Garrity, who happened
to be in that city.&#8221;

216&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;

&#8220;My own business chanced to call me out to
Cleveland at that time, and I saw Parlmee and
Garrity together at the American House.&#8221;

Locke took a long breath, recalling the fact that
Parlmee, although professing to be in great haste
when in Indianapolis, had not returned to his New
York office as soon as expected.

&#8220;That may have been an accidental meeting,&#8221;
said the southpaw. &#8220;Your proof has holes in it.&#8221;

The reporter lighted a fresh cigarette. &#8220;How
does it happen,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;that Parlmee is buying
up all the small blocks of the club stock that he
can get hold of?&#8221;

Lefty started as if pricked by the point of a
knife. Parlmee, an automobile salesman, a man
who had found it necessary to get out and show
that he could make good in the business world,
buying the stock of the club!

&#8220;Is he?&#8221; asked the pitcher.

&#8220;He is,&#8221; asserted Stillman positively. &#8220;I
know of three lots that he has purchased, and in
each instance he has paid a little more than it was
supposed to be worth.&#8221;

&#8220;He&#8211;he may have bought it as an investment,&#8221;
faltered Janet.

The reporter smiled at her. &#8220;As far as I can
learn, Franklin Parlmee is not situated, financially,
217
to invest much money in stock of any kind.
With his stock depreciating, and bound to go
lower in value, he would be a chump to purchase
it as an investment. The man who pays more
than its market value in order to get hold of it
knows something about the doings behind the
scenes that is not known to the general public.
Apparently that man is Parlmee. Who&#8217;s furnishing
him the money to buy the stock? My own
guess is that it is the man who&#8217;s looking to get
control of the club, and that man is Garrity.&#8221;

Still Janet protested that it was impossible, but
she looked questioningly at Lefty, the doubt that
she was fighting against was now beginning to
creep into her eyes.

&#8220;Parlmee,&#8221; said the southpaw, &#8220;has gone to
Europe. I have a message from him stating that
he would sail on the Northumberland. If he&#8217;s behind
the plot to wreck the Blue Stockings, why
should he leave the field of action at this time?&#8221;

&#8220;If I&#8217;ve got his number,&#8221; returned Stillman,
&#8220;he&#8217;s a liar in various ways. Perhaps he has
sailed for Europe; perhaps he hasn&#8217;t. His message
may be nothing more than a little dust for
your eyes. But if he has sailed, there&#8217;s only one
answer to that.&#8221;

&#8220;Out with it!&#8221; urged Locke. &#8220;Of course, you
think it another move in the rotten game?&#8221;

218&#8220;Sure as death and taxes. He believes the
time is ripe to get at Collier. He&#8217;s gone across
to get at him and twist the control of the club out
of his hands. Probably he&#8217;ll appear before Collier
in the guise of a friend anxious to save him
from complete financial disaster. He&#8217;s got just
about enough time to make the trip comfortably,
get that business through with, and return before
the regular meeting of the league magnates here
in New York. Then, at the meeting, Tom Garrity
will bob up serenely as the real owner of the Blue
Stockings.&#8221;


219CHAPTER XXVINOT MUCH SHOW

Tired out, Janet went to bed shortly after
Stillman left, but Locke, knowing he
could not sleep, sat up to think the situation
over. The difficulties and problems of his
own position seemed greater than ever. If the
plot was as deep and intricate as the reporter believed,
and if the men behind it were moving with
haste and certainty to the accomplishment of their
designs, there seemed scarcely a ghost of a chance
for him, practically alone and unaided, to block
them.

For Lefty now felt that, in a way, he was standing
alone. Even Kennedy, having no power,
could do little more than offer advice. And where
was Kennedy?

The southpaw had fancied that he would be
given more time to muster his opposing forces for
the battle. He had even imagined, at first, that
the man he would need to contend against and defeat
was Weegman. But now Weegman, the blind
tool of craftier creatures, looked insignificant and
weak. In order to defeat him it would be necessary
to strike higher.

220How was he to strike? That was the question.
Locke had suggested to Stillman complete exposure
of the plot by newspaper publicity. And right
there the reporter, who had seemed so confident of
his ground, had betrayed that, after his usual
method, he was working by intuition, and had no
positive and unassailable verification of his conclusions.
It would not do for his paper to charge
criminal conspiracy without proper evidence to
back up such an indictment.

Recalling this, Lefty remembered that Stillman,
having heard all the southpaw could tell, had
ended by giving his own theory, and had offered
proof to substantiate it. And then he had been
compelled to acknowledge that the proof he had
to offer was not sound enough to base exposure
and open action upon.

If Stillman were right, doubtless Parlmee had
gone abroad with full knowledge of Charles Collier&#8217;s
whereabouts. That knowledge being denied
Lefty, he could not warn Collier, and the plot
would be carried through as arranged. Then, as
the reporter had predicted, at the annual meeting
of the magnates, shortly to be held, Garrity would
appear as owner of the Blue Stockings. When
that happened, the fight would be over, and the
conspirators would be triumphant.

With the door to Janet&#8217;s chamber closed, Locke
221
walked the floor, striving for a clear conception
of what ought to be done. He felt like a man
bound hand and foot. Of course, he could go on
with his project to strengthen the team, but the
harvest of his success would be reaped by the
plotters, if they, too, were successful. There was
little uncertainty about what would happen to him,
for he knew that his conscience would not permit
him to become an understrapper for Garrity. He
had left Fernandon with courage and high hope
to do battle; but now the helplessness of the situation
threatened to appall him.

If there were only some way to get into communication
with Collier. Again he thought of his
somewhat shaken conviction that Virginia was in
New York. If that were true, some of her family
or friends must know it, and, of course, Virginia
would know how to communicate without delay
with her father.

With this thought came the conviction that in
Virginia lay his only hope. If he had been mistaken,
and she were not in the United States, his
chance of doing anything to foil the conspirators
was not one in a thousand. His work for the morrow
was cut out for him; he must learn positively
if Charles Collier&#8217;s daughter was on American
soil, and, if so, he must find her.

The telephone rang, and when he answered it
222
he was informed that Kennedy was calling. The
faithful old veteran had come, after all! Lefty
said that he was to be sent up at once.

&#8220;Well, son,&#8221; said old Jack, as he came in, &#8220;how
are things moving?&#8221;

&#8220;None too well,&#8221; answered Lefty, shaking his
hand.

&#8220;So?&#8221; grunted Kennedy. &#8220;I wondered just
what was up, and I came right along in answer to
your call, but my train was delayed. What are the
new developments?&#8221;

&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said Locke, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll tell you.
Since I sent you that message I&#8217;ve heard something
that&#8217;s got me guessing&#8211;and worried.&#8221;

&#8220;The contracts?&#8221; questioned old Jack, sitting
down. &#8220;The boys signed up, didn&#8217;t they?&#8221;

&#8220;Every one of them. That&#8217;s not the trouble.
I&#8217;ve had a talk with Jack Stillman.&#8221;

&#8220;The only reporter I know with a noodle
screwed on right,&#8221; said Kennedy. &#8220;His bean&#8217;s
packed with sound sense. When he gets an idea
it&#8217;s generally correct.&#8221;

&#8220;In that case, unless he&#8217;s made a bobble this
time, the situation&#8217;s worse than we suspected,
Jack.&#8221;

&#8220;Give me the dope,&#8221; urged Kennedy.

The old man listened to Locke without comment,
and when Lefty had finished, he sat thoughtfully
223
plucking at his under lip with his thumb and forefinger.

&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, after a time, &#8220;Stillman usually
puts them in the groove when he shoots.&#8221;

&#8220;Then you think he&#8217;s hit it right in this case?&#8221;

&#8220;I haven&#8217;t said so. If anybody else had passed
this one up, I&#8217;d have said it missed the plate by a
rod. With Stillman doing the pitching, I&#8217;m not
so ready to give a decision against him. But you
say he finished a lot more confident than he began?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes. Instead of seeking information, he finished
up by giving it.&#8221;

&#8220;Just as though he had talked himself into a
settled conviction as he went along?&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;

&#8220;Then we won&#8217;t accept his statement as fact
until he gets some kind of proof, son. You know
more about Parlmee than I do, and you&#8217;ve always
figured that gent on the level, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes; but I&#8217;m compelled to admit that I haven&#8217;t
had sufficient dealings with him to feel certain that
my estimation of his character is correct. Furthermore,
my first impression was unfavorable.&#8221;

&#8220;First impressions are sometimes the best.&#8221;

&#8220;But at that time, as you know, my judgment
could hardly be unprejudiced. It was when Collier
first took over the team and I had trouble with
224
Carson, the manager he put in your place. Everything
seemed going wrong then.&#8221;

A grin broke over Kennedy&#8217;s face, and he
chuckled softly, a reminiscent expression in his
keen old eyes.

&#8220;Those were some stirring times, boy,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Collier fired me for Al Carson, and Carson made
a mess of it. He&#8217;s managing a dub league team
now. He thought he could get along without you,
just as Collier reckoned he could dispense with
me; but at the finish it was you and me that came
back and saved the day for the Stockings. You
pitched the game of your life that last day of the
season. Now it&#8217;s up to you to come back again,
and I&#8217;ve got a hunch that you will. You&#8217;ll return,
better than ever. You&#8217;re going to make the wiseacres
that think you&#8217;re down and out look foolish.&#8221;

Locke shook his head. &#8220;Knowing what I do,
do you suppose I could do that if Garrity got hold
of the team? I wouldn&#8217;t have the heart to work
for that scoundrel. Back in the time we&#8217;re speaking
of, it was Stillman&#8217;s cleverness that straightened
things out. Not another newspaper man got
wise to the real situation. With his usual uncanny
intuition, he saw through it all, and, as usual, he
made no mistake.&#8221;

&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; admitted old Jack.

225&#8220;All the more reason to suppose he is right now.
We can&#8217;t dodge that fact. To-morrow I&#8217;m going
to make every effort to find some method of getting
into communication with Charles Collier. It&#8217;s
my only play in this game. If it fails&#8211;good
night!&#8221;

Again Lefty began pacing the floor; it seemed
that he could not wait patiently for the coming
day; he was burning with a desire to get to work
at once. It had been his purpose to seek Kennedy&#8217;s
advice on other matters, but these now
seemed secondary and unimportant for the time
being. His talk with Stillman had led him to alter
completely his plan of immediate action. To prevent
the control of the team from falling into the
clutches of the conspirators was now his sole purpose,
as the problem of rebuilding it and restoring
it to its former strength and prestige could be
solved later.

Kennedy sat thinking, plucking at his under lip,
as was the old man&#8217;s habit when perplexed. &#8220;Yes,
son,&#8221; he said, after a time, &#8220;that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re up
against. Old P. T. Barnum had a show; but it
doesn&#8217;t look like you have.&#8221;


226CHAPTER XXVIITHE SUSPENDED AX

All the next forenoon, Locke kept the
wires hot. He &#8217;phoned and telegraphed
to every one he could think of who
might be able to give him the information he desired
so desperately. He met with one disappointment
after another. In each instance the
reply came back that both Charles Collier and his
daughter were somewhere in Europe, but no one
appeared to know just where. If his efforts established
anything at all, it seemed to be the fact
that Lefty had been mistaken in thinking he had
seen Virginia in New York; for if she were there,
surely some of these people would know of it.
The feeling of helplessness, of fighting against
greedy and remorseless forces too strong for him
to checkmate, pressed upon him heavily.

It was a little after noon when he called the
office of the Blade. He wanted to talk to Stillman
again. If anybody in New York could find a person
wanted, the reporter was the man to do it, and
Locke believed that for friendship&#8217;s sake Stillman
would attempt it.

227Near the telephone switchboard in the hotel
were two long shelves, situated a little distance
apart, at which patrons could consult the different
directories. At one of these, several persons were
looking up numbers, so Locke took his book to the
other shelf and found the call for the editorial
rooms of the Blade. A man at the next shelf
turned, saw the pitcher, and listened when Lefty
gave the number to the operator. Instead of giving
his own number, which he had found, the man
noted down the southpaw&#8217;s call on a card. It was
the fourth time during the day that this same man
had made a record of a number asked for by
Locke.

Returning the card to his pocket, the man pretended
to busy himself again over one of the directories,
keeping his back partly turned toward
the pitcher. Soon he heard the switchboard girl
repeat Lefty&#8217;s number, and direct him to booth
No. 1.

The man closed his book and turned round
slowly. The southpaw was disappearing into a
booth at the end of one of the rows, and, in closing
the door behind him, he unintentionally left it
slightly open. The watching man moved quietly
forward until he was close to this booth, through
the glass of which he could see that Lefty&#8217;s back
was partly turned toward him. There he paused,
228
taking some letters and papers from his pocket
and running them over as if searching for something.
While appearing to be absorbed in his own
affairs, he could hear every word that the pitcher
spoke into the receiver.

Getting the editorial rooms of the Blade, Locke
asked for Stillman. After a slight delay, he was
informed that the reporter was not there. No
one could say just when he would be in.

&#8220;This is important,&#8221; stated Lefty; &#8220;a matter
in which he is greatly interested. I must talk with
him as soon as possible. Will you ask him, as soon
as he comes in, to call Philip Hazelton at the Great
Eastern? Yes, Hazelton; that&#8217;s right. Why,
yes, I&#8217;m Lefty Locke. All right; don&#8217;t fail to tell
him immediately he arrives.&#8221;

The man outside slipped the letters and papers
into his pocket, and turned away after the manner
of a person who has suddenly decided upon something.
He had not walked ten steps, however, before
he turned back. The southpaw was paying
for the call. The man watched him now without
further effort to avoid notice, and when the
pitcher turned from the switchboard he stepped
forward deliberately to meet him.

&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said the man in a voice distinctly
husky and unpleasant. &#8220;How are you, Locke?&#8221;

Lefty stopped short and stared. It was Garrity,
229
coarse, complacent, patronizing. The owner
of the Rockets grinned, showing the numerous
gold fillings in his teeth. His features were large,
and his jaw was square and brutal. His clothes
were those of a common race-track follower.

&#8220;Quite well, thank you,&#8221; answered Lefty coldly,
thinking of the pleasure it would be to tell Garrity
his private opinion of him.

&#8220;Seems to me you look worried. I don&#8217;t wonder,
though, considering the job they&#8217;ve handed
you. Some job piecing together the tattered remnants,
hey? It&#8217;s going to make you a busy little
manager.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m busy now,&#8221; said the southpaw, moving as
if to pass on; but Garrity detained him. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got some positions to fill. The Feds got at you
hard. Shame to see a team like the Stockings
shot to pieces. You&#8217;ve got three or four bad
holes, and I&#8217;d like to help you.&#8221;

&#8220;You would?&#8221;

&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;ve got the very lads you need, too&#8211;Mundy
and Pendexter. Both fast men. They
work together like two parts of a machine. Mundy
covers the short field like Maranville, and Pendexter
sure can play that keystone cushion. They&#8217;re
the boys for you.&#8221;

&#8220;How&#8217;s it happen you are willing to let go of
them?&#8221; asked Locke, feeling some curiosity to
230
know what lay behind this particular proposition.

&#8220;Well, this is between us, mind? I&#8217;d just about
as soon give up an eye as part with either Mundy
or Pendexter, but it&#8217;s easier to lose them than
dispense with Pressly, my third sacker. That&#8217;s
been the trouble with my team. Pressly loves
Mundy and Pendexter as he loves aconite, and they
reciprocate. You know what a feud like that
means. It knocks the bottom out of any team. I
can&#8217;t fill Pressly&#8217;s place, but I&#8217;ve got a couple of
youngsters that I can work in at short and second.
I&#8217;m not going through another season with those
three scrapping. You need the very players I&#8217;m
willing to part with, and there we are.&#8221;

Locke knew the man was not honest, and that
he was holding something up his sleeve. In order
to make him show his hand, the southpaw asked:

&#8220;What do you want for Mundy and Pendexter?&#8221;

Garrity considered for a minute. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
answered slowly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll trade them with you for
Spider Grant&#8211;and cash.&#8221;

Lefty stared at him in amazement. Was it possible
the man could think he was such a soft mark?
He laughed loudly.

&#8220;You don&#8217;t want much, do you, Garrity? The
&#8216;and cash&#8217; was a capper! Man, I wouldn&#8217;t trade
231
you Spider Grant for your whole team&#8211;and
cash!&#8221;

The owner of the Rockets scowled, glaring at
Locke, the corners of his thick-lipped mouth drooping.

&#8220;Oh, you wouldn&#8217;t, hey?&#8221; he growled huskily.
&#8220;I suppose you think that&#8217;s a joke?&#8221;

&#8220;Not at all; it&#8217;s serious. I couldn&#8217;t use the
players you offer, anyhow. Mundy does cover the
short field like Rabbit Maranville&#8211;sometimes; but
he&#8217;s got a yellow streak, and he quits. Pendexter
knows how to play second, and at the beginning of
last season he hit like old Sockalexis when the Indian
first broke into the league. But the pitchers
all got wise to his weak spot, close and across the
knees, and from a three-hundred-and-sixty batter
he slumped into the two-hundred class. You were
thinking of asking for waivers on him. Spider
Grant&#8211;and cash&#8211;for that pair! I didn&#8217;t imagine
that even you could think me such a boob.&#8221;

As he listened, Garrity&#8217;s face showed his anger;
his breath came short and quick; his eyes were
blazing with the fury of a wild animal.

&#8220;Have you got that all out of your system?&#8221; he
asked, when Lefty stopped. &#8220;You&#8217;re a wise
gazabo, ain&#8217;t you? You know all about baseball
and players and such things! You&#8217;ve got a head
bigger than a balloon. But it&#8217;ll shrink, give it
232
time. It&#8217;s plain you think you really know how
to manage a team. By the middle of the season,
and maybe considerable before that, your head will
be about the size of a bird shot. And you&#8217;ll know
a lot more then than you do now, believe me!&#8221;

The southpaw laughed in his face. &#8220;Don&#8217;t lose
your temper,&#8221; he advised, &#8220;just because you
couldn&#8217;t put a raw one over on me. Go ahead and
ask waivers on Pendexter. You&#8217;ll get mine. I
wouldn&#8217;t carry him on my team if you agreed to
pay his season&#8217;s salary for me. My trade with
Frazer gave you the notion that you could pick
another good man off me, and weaken the Stockings
still more. You fooled yourself that time,
Garrity. Perhaps you&#8217;ll find out before long that
you are fooling yourself in other ways.&#8221;

&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you guess. But just remember what
Bobby Burns said about &#8216;the best-laid plans o&#8217;
mice and men.&#8217;&#8221;

With this, Locke passed on, leaving the wrathy
owner of the Rockets glaring after him.

&#8220;You poor fool!&#8221; muttered Garrity. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have you whimpering like a whipped dog before
I&#8217;m done with you. Your head&#8217;s liable to roll into
the basket before the season opens. When the
time comes, I&#8217;ll lift my finger, and the ax&#8217;ll fall.&#8221;


233CHAPTER XXVIIITHE GAGE OF WAR

Janet had let some friends know that she
was in the city, and had been invited out
to a matinée performance at one of the
theaters. Lefty urged her to go. &#8220;That&#8217;s better
than sitting around the rooms alone,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll be so busy that I can&#8217;t be with you.&#8221;

So when, shortly after lunch, her friends appeared
in a comfortable limousine, they had little
trouble in persuading her to join them.

Kennedy dropped in a little later, and Locke
told him of Garrity&#8217;s proposed trade.

&#8220;He sure did pick you for a mark,&#8221; said the
ex-manager. &#8220;You handed it to him straight
about Mundy and Pendexter. You&#8217;re going to
need a pair of fast boys to stop the holes, but
there&#8217;s better men in the minors than those two.
You&#8217;ve got better ones on the reserve list. Besides
that, I&#8217;m doin&#8217; a little free scouting on my
own hook. I&#8217;ve got friends scattered all over the
country. Whenever an old player, gone to the
scraps, has touched me up for a five or a ten, I&#8217;ve
stood for the touch, asking him to keep his eyes
234
open for anything good he might run across in the
sticks. That way I&#8217;ve got a good deal of inexpensive
scouting done for me. Maybe it&#8217;ll be
worth something in this pinch. I&#8217;m going to interview
an old friend over in Jersey this afternoon.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying over players just now,&#8221; said
Lefty. &#8220;I&#8217;m anxious to get hold of Stillman.&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;ll hear from him in time&#8211;and Weegman,
too. What Garrity knows Weegman knows, and
so he&#8217;s wise that you&#8217;re right here. Be ready for
him when he shows up.&#8221;

Kennedy had only just gone when Weegman
appeared. He laughed when he saw Locke, but it
was an ugly laugh.

&#8220;What do you think you&#8217;re trying to do?&#8221; he
demanded. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you get my telegram ordering
you to report at the office of the club?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, why didn&#8217;t you obey? What did you
mean by coming right through without even sending
me word?&#8221;

&#8220;I had immediate business here in New York.&#8221;

&#8220;Business! I had business for you to attend
to. You&#8217;ve been doing a lot of things without
consulting me. Why didn&#8217;t you wait until I gave
you the contracts for the old players?&#8221;

&#8220;There had been too much waiting, and time
235
was precious. Kennedy had plenty of blanks, so
I got them from him, filled them out, and sent them
to the boys without further delay. It was the
proper thing to do.&#8221;

&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me what&#8217;s proper to do! I&#8217;ll tell
you. That was the distinct understanding, and
you know it. Sent out the contracts, did you?
Well, some of them ought to be coming back by
this time.&#8221;

&#8220;They&#8217;ve all come back.&#8221;

&#8220;What?&#8221;

&#8220;Every one of them. The Federals&#8217;ll get no
more players off us this year.&#8221;

Weegman choked, and the sound that came from
his lips was not a laugh.

&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen anything of them. They didn&#8217;t
come to the office.&#8221;

&#8220;No, certainly not.&#8221;

&#8220;Certainly not! Then where&#8211;where are
they?&#8221;

&#8220;I have them in my pocket.&#8221;

Lefty said it quietly, not at all disturbed by the
wrath of the outraged schemer. It gave him much
satisfaction to see Bailey Weegman shake and
squirm.

&#8220;In your pocket!&#8221; spluttered the rascal. &#8220;You
had them returned to a different address? Confound
your crust! How&#8217;d you ever have the nerve
236
to do a thing like that? Let&#8217;s see them. Hand
them over!&#8221;

Locke made no move to obey. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll keep
them a while,&#8221; he answered coolly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll deliver
them personally to be locked in the club safe.&#8221;

For a moment it seemed that Weegman would
lose all control of himself and attack the southpaw.

&#8220;You fool!&#8221; he raged. &#8220;Do you think you&#8217;re
going to get by with this stuff?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve made a pretty fair start at it.&#8221;

&#8220;So you never meant to stand by the private
agreement between us when you signed as manager?
That&#8217;s it, eh?&#8221;

&#8220;There never was any private agreement between
us. I signed to handle the team, but I did
not agree to become your puppet.&#8221;

&#8220;You did. You said that&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;That I understood the conditions you had proposed,
but I did not say that I consented to them.
I had no intention of letting you dictate to me.&#8221;

&#8220;Fool! Fool!&#8221; snarled Weegman. &#8220;How
long do you think you&#8217;ll last? And you made that
crazy trade with Frazer! Do you know what I&#8217;ve
done? Well, I&#8217;ve notified Frazer that the deal was
irregular, and won&#8217;t be recognized by the club.
Not a dollar of that five thousand will he ever
get.&#8221;

237&#8220;You know better than that. The trade was
legitimate, and it will stand. Frazer can collect
by law. Any other deal that I make will go
through, too, whether you are aware of it at the
time or not. Until Charles Collier himself takes
away my authority, I&#8217;m manager of the team with
the legal right to carry out my own plans, and I
intend to do so. I shall ask no advice from you,
and any suggestion you may make I shall look
upon with distrust.&#8221;

They fought it out, eye to eye, and presently
Weegman&#8217;s gaze wavered before that of the unawed
southpaw. The man he had sought to make
his blind tool was defying him to his face.

&#8220;I see your finish!&#8221; he declared.

&#8220;And I see yours,&#8221; countered Locke. &#8220;You
think you&#8217;re a clever crook. You&#8217;re merely an instrument
in the hands of a bigger and cleverer
scoundrel who doesn&#8217;t care a rap what happens to
you if he can put his own miserable scheme
over. Your partnership with him will be your
ruin, anyhow. If you had half the sense you think
you possess, you&#8217;d break with him without losing
any time.&#8221;

&#8220;What are you talking about? I&#8217;ve only
planned to do my best to save a team that has
been raided by the Feds. You&#8217;re killing the last
chance for the Blue Stockings.&#8221;

238&#8220;Tell it to Sweeny!&#8221; exclaimed Lefty.
&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to deliver the team into the hands
of Tom Garrity. Deny it if you wish, but it isn&#8217;t
necessary to lie. You&#8217;ve played Judas with Collier.&#8221;

&#8220;Be careful! Better take that back!&#8221;

Lefty laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to add more to it.
I haven&#8217;t told you half what I know. If I were
to do so, you&#8217;d realize what a dumb fool you have
made of yourself. You think you&#8217;re wise to all
that was planned, but you&#8217;ve been let in on only a
very little of it. You&#8217;ll tear your hair when you
get a squint at the foundation stone of this neat
little conspiracy.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s right, you don&#8217;t; but you will know in
time. You&#8217;ll be kept in the dark as long as it
suits Tom Garrity.&#8221;

&#8220;What&#8217;s Garrity got to do with it?&#8221;

Locke smiled on him pityingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
childish, Weegman. That sort of a bluff is too
thin. I was wise when I signed to manage the
team.&#8221;

In vain the man stormed, threatened, coaxed,
cajoled; he could not bend Lefty in the least, and
at last he realized that he had made a big blunder
in estimating the character of the southpaw.

&#8220;So it&#8217;s war between us, is it?&#8221; he finally asked.

239&#8220;I have looked for nothing else,&#8221; answered the
pitcher.

Weegman snapped his fingers in Locke&#8217;s face.
&#8220;All right!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You would have it! Just
you wait! You&#8217;re going to regret it! We&#8217;ll see
how long you last!&#8221; And, turning round, he
strode away, muttering to himself.


240CHAPTER XXIXTHE JAWS OF THE TRAP

Lefty had defied Weegman. Henceforth
it was to be open war, and he was glad of
it. What the rascal would attempt to do
he did not know, and cared less. It did not seem
likely that he could do much, if anything, that he
had not already made preparations to do. Of
course, he might call Collier into the affair, and
that, should it bring the owner of the Blue Stockings
back to his own country, was something
earnestly to be desired. Could he but get Collier
in private for twenty minutes, Locke felt sure he
could make him realize that he was the victim of a
conspiracy, and that his trusted private secretary
had sought to sell him out into the hands of a rival
owner.

The telephone rang, and, thinking Stillman was
calling at last, he hastened to answer. It was not
the reporter&#8217;s voice that he heard, but he was informed
that some one was speaking from the office
of the Blade, and that, after making a fruitless
effort to get Locke on the wire, Stillman had found
241
it necessary to hustle away to keep an important
appointment.

&#8220;But where can I find him?&#8221; asked the disappointed
pitcher. &#8220;How can I get hold of him?&#8221;

&#8220;He wants to talk to you as much as you do to
him,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Said it was absolutely
necessary. That&#8217;s why he had me call you. Says
he has something to tell you, personally and privately.
He&#8217;ll try to be at Mike&#8217;s saloon, Thompson
Street, near Broome, at three o&#8217;clock. If you
get there first, wait for him. And don&#8217;t fail to
come, for he&#8217;ll have important information. Got
that straight?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, but&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ve done my duty. Good-by.&#8221;
There was a click, and the wire was silent.

Lefty looked at his watch as he left the phone.
It was twenty-two minutes to three.

&#8220;Just about time enough to make it comfortably,&#8221;
he decided. &#8220;Stillman must be on the track
of something.&#8221;

The subway being convenient, he chose it instead
of a taxi, getting off at Spring Street. Five
minutes ahead of time, he found Mike&#8217;s saloon, a
somewhat disreputable-looking place when viewed
from the exterior. The neighborhood, likewise,
seemed sinister. However, a reporter&#8217;s business,
thought Locke, carried him into all sorts of places.

242Within the saloon a single patron, who looked
like a vagrant, was picking at the crumbs of a
sickly free lunch in a dark corner. A husky-looking,
red-headed bartender was removing an emptied
beer schooner and mopping up the counter.
He surveyed the southpaw from head to foot with
apparent interest.

&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for a man named Stillman who
made an appointment to meet me here at three,&#8221;
explained Lefty. &#8220;I was to wait for him if I got
here first.&#8221;

&#8220;Jack&#8217;s here,&#8221; stated the man behind the bar,
in a manner that bespoke considerable familiarity
with the reporter. &#8220;Came in three or four minutes
ago. Reckon you&#8217;re Lefty Locke?&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;

&#8220;He told me you might come round. He&#8217;s in
the back room. Walk right in.&#8221; The speaker
jerked a heavy thumb toward a closed door at the
far end of the bar.

At the sound of Locke&#8217;s name the vagrant, who
had been picking at the free lunch, turned to look
the famous pitcher over with apparent curiosity
and interest.

&#8220;Lefty Locke,&#8221; he mumbled huskily. &#8220;Lemme
shake han&#8217;s. Ruther shake han&#8217;s with Lefty
Locke than any man livin&#8217;.&#8221;

Locke pushed past him and placed his hand
243
on the knob of the door. The fellow followed,
insisting upon shaking hands, and, as Lefty
opened the door, the vagrant staggered, lurched
against the pitcher, and thrust him forward, the
door closing behind him with the snap of a spring
lock.

It is remarkable how seldom any one ever heeds
premonitions. Even as he opened that door, Lefty
was aware that ever since the telephone call had
come to him some subtle intuition, thus far wholly
disregarded, had been seeking to sound a warning.
It had caused him to hesitate at last. Too late!
The push delivered by the vagrant had pitched him
forward into the snare, while the sound of the
clicking spring lock notified him that his retreat
was cut off.

Through a dirty skylight above another door
that probably opened upon a back alley some weak
and sickly rays of daylight crept into the room.
A single gas jet, suspended from the center of the
cracked and smoky ceiling, gave a feeble, flickering
light, filling the corners with fluttering shadows.
The furniture in the room consisted of a
table and a few chairs.

At the table three men were sitting, drinking and
smoking. Locke, recovering from the push he had
received, stepped back against the closed door,
and looked at them.

244&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Mit Skullen. &#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry
away, Lefty. Folks that come in by that door
sometimes go out by the other one.&#8221;

He was grinning viciously, triumphantly. The
look upon his face was one of satisfaction and
brutal anticipation, and amply proclaimed his purpose.

Skullen&#8217;s companions were tough characters, fit
associates and abettors of such a man. That they
were thugs of the lowest type, who would not hesitate
at any act of violence, there could be no question.
One looked like a prize fighter who had
gone to the bad, his drink-inflamed face and bleary
eyes advertising the cause of his downfall. The
other had the appearance of a &#8220;coke&#8221; fiend, and
the criminally bent habitual user of that drug has
neither scruples nor fear of consequences.

Locke regarded them in silence. His pulses
were throbbing somewhat faster, yet he was cool
and self-possessed, and his brain was keenly
active. He knew precisely what he was up against.
Slipping one hand behind him, he tried the knob
of the door; but, as he had expected, the door held
fast.

Skullen continued to grin gloatingly, fancying
that Locke&#8217;s inactivity was evidence that he was
practically paralyzed by amazement and fear.

&#8220;Your friend Stillman was too busy to come,&#8221;
245
he said, &#8220;and so I kept the appointment for him.
Maybe I&#8217;ll do just as well. Anyhow, I&#8217;ll do&#8211;for
you!&#8221;

He had risen to his feet, and the light of the
flickering gas jet played over his evil face. Lefty
flashed another look around, taking in the surroundings.
To his ears came the distant, muffled
sound of an elevated train rumbling along the
trestle. Behind him, in the front of the saloon,
all was still. Probably the door leading to the
street was now also locked to prevent any one
from entering and hearing any disturbance that
might take place in the back room. The jaws of
the trap held him fast.

&#8220;Oh, it ain&#8217;t any use to think about runnin&#8217;
away, Lefty,&#8221; croaked Mit. &#8220;Not a chance in the
world. I fixed it so&#8217;s we could have our little settlement
without any one buttin&#8217; in to bother us.
You remember I told you I had a score to settle
with you?&#8221;

As Locke spoke, his voice was calm and steady.
&#8220;And you engaged a pair of worthy pals to assist
you! You&#8217;re a brave man, Skullen!&#8221;

&#8220;Aw, these lads are only here to see fair play,
that&#8217;s all. They won&#8217;t mix in. They won&#8217;t have
to. Last time we met you reckoned you put it
all over me, didn&#8217;t you? Maybe I ought to thank
you for keepin&#8217; me from gettin&#8217; a rotter on me
246
hands, for that&#8217;s what you got in Dummy Jones.
You&#8217;re welcome to that piece of cheese.&#8221;

The southpaw made no retort. He was measuring
his chances against all three of the ruffians,
having no doubt that he must soon find himself
pitted against such odds.

&#8220;Some baseball manager, that&#8217;s what you are!&#8221;
scoffed Mit, taking keen delight in prolonging the
suspense that he fancied must be getting the
nerve of the intended victim. &#8220;You&#8217;re rattlin&#8217;
around like a buckshot inside a bass drum. A
busy little person, you are, but you won&#8217;t be so
busy after I finish with you. You&#8217;ll find it convenient
to take a nice long rest in a hospital.&#8221;

&#8220;You fight a lot with your mouth, Mit,&#8221; said
Locke contemptuously.

&#8220;Go ahead an&#8217; sail inter him, Skully,&#8221; urged
the ruffian who looked like a broken-down prize
fighter. &#8220;You been itchin&#8217; fer him to show up so
you could get inter action. Go to it!&#8221;

&#8220;Plenty of time, Bill. I enjoy seein&#8217; him try
to push that door down with his back. Wasn&#8217;t he
a mut to walk right into this? I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to change
the look of his face so that his handsome wife won&#8217;t
know him when she sees him next.&#8221;

He began to remove his coat, and Lefty knew
the time for action had come. For an instant his
imagination had sought to unnerve him by presenting
247
a vivid picture of himself as he would
appear, battered, bleeding, beaten up, if the trio
of thugs carried out their evil design; but he put
the vision aside promptly. In cases where a
smaller force is compelled to contend with a
greater, the advantage is frequently obtained
through swift and sudden assault. Knowing this,
Locke did not wait to be attacked. He hurled himself
forward with the spring of a panther and the
force of a catapult.


248CHAPTER XXXONE AGAINST THREE

Skullen, in the act of removing his coat,
was caught unprepared. Before he could
fling the garment aside Locke was upon him,
aiming a well-meant blow for the point of Mit&#8217;s
jaw.

Skullen realized that it was no trifling thing to
stop such a blow as that, and he jerked his head
aside, as he dropped his coat. The blow caught
him glancingly and sent him staggering, upsetting
the chair from which he had recently risen. Locke
grabbed the edge of the table and pitched it against
the ruffian&#8217;s two companions, who had hastily
started to get up. They fell over, with the table
on top of them.

Lefty followed up his advantage, and kept right
on after Skullen. Uttering a snarl of astonished
rage, the latter sought to grapple, but the southpaw
knew that he could not afford to waste time
in that sort of a struggle. Whatever he did must
be done swiftly, effectively, and thoroughly. Delay
meant only disaster to him. Avoiding the clutching
249
hands of his antagonist, he struck Mit on the
neck, below the ear, staggering him again.

Skullen had not looked for such a whirlwind
assault. He had fancied the trapped man would
wait until set upon, and he had believed he would
have little trouble in beating Lefty to the full satisfaction
of his revengeful heart. He was strong
and ponderous, and he could still strike a terrible
blow, but years had slowed him down, his lack of
exercise had softened his muscles, his eye had lost
its quickness, while indulgence in drink and dissipation
had taken the snap and ginger out of him.
He had not realized before how much he had
deteriorated, but now, witnessing the lightning-like
movements of Lefty Locke, he began to understand,
and sudden apprehension overcame him.

&#8220;Bill! Snuff!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Get into it! Get
at him, you snails! Soak him!&#8221;

His appeal to his companions was an unintentional
admission that he suddenly realized he was
no match for the man he had attempted to beat.
The flickering gaslight had given him a glimpse of
a terrible blazing look in Locke&#8217;s eyes. Once, in
the ring, he had seen a look like that in the eyes
of an opponent who had apparently gone crazy.
And he had been knocked out by him!

Scrambling up from beneath the capsized table,
Bill and Snuff responded. Lefty knew that in a
250
moment they would take a hand in the fight, and
then the odds would be three against one, and
none of the three would hesitate at any brutal
methods to smash the one. Once he was beaten
down, they would kick and stamp him into insensibility;
and later, perhaps, he would be found outside
somewhere in the back alley, with broken
bones, possibly maimed and disfigured for life.

The knowledge of what would happen to him,
if defeated, made him doubly strong and fierce.
He endeavored to dispose of Skullen first, believing
that by doing so he would have half the battle
won.

Skullen&#8217;s howls to his companions came to an
abrupt termination. Like an irresistible engine
of destruction, Locke had smashed through the
defense of the ruffian, and, reaching him with a
terrible blow, sent him spinning and crashing into
a corner of the room. At the same instant, Bill,
joining in, was met by a back kick in the pit of
his stomach, and, with a grunt, he doubled up,
clutching at his middle with both hands.

This gave the southpaw a chance to turn on
Snuff, who had not, so far, shown any great desire
to help his pals. The creature had seemed physically
insignificant, sitting at the table, but now,
in action, he moved with the quickness of a wild
cat, in great contrast to the ponderousness of
251
Skullen. And he had a weapon in his hand&#8211;a
blackjack!

The southpaw realized that, of his three antagonists,
the creature springing at him like a
deadly tarantula was the most to be dreaded. Insanity
blazed in the fellow&#8217;s eyes. He struck with
the blackjack, and Lefty barely avoided the
blow.

Locke snapped out his left foot, and caught the
toe of the man plunging past him, sending him
spinning to the floor. Snuff&#8217;s body struck a leg
of the overturned table and broke it off short, but
the shock of the fall seemed to have absolutely no
effect upon him; for he rebounded from the floor
like a rubber ball, and was on his feet again in a
flash, panting and snarling.

&#8220;Get him, Snuff&#8211;get him!&#8221; urged Skullen,
coming up out of the corner where he had been
thrown.

Bill, recovering his breath, was straightening
up. All three of the thugs would be at the southpaw
again in another jiffy. Lefty darted round
the table, avoiding the blackjack, but realizing
what a small chance he had with his bare hands.
He could not keep up the dodging long. Then he
saw the broken table leg, and snatched it up.
With an upward swing, he landed a blow on
Snuff&#8217;s elbow, breaking his arm. The blackjack
252
flew to the smoky ceiling, and then thudded back
to the floor.

Feeling sure he had checked his most dangerous
antagonist, Lefty turned, swinging the table
leg, and gave Skullen a crack on the shoulder that
dropped him to his knees. He had aimed at Mit&#8217;s
head, but the fellow had partially succeeded in
dodging the blow.

Another blow, and the cry of alarm that rose
to Bill&#8217;s lips was broken short. Bill went down,
knocked senseless.

But Snuff, in spite of his broken arm, was
charging again. He was seeking to get at the
southpaw with his bare left hand! The pitcher,
however, had no compunction, and he beat the
madman down instantly.

Groaning and clinging to his injured shoulder,
Skullen retreated hastily to the wall, staring in
amazement and incomprehension at the breathless
but triumphant man he had lured into this trap.
In all his experience he had never encountered
such a fighter.

There being no one to stop him now, Lefty
walked to the door leading into the alley, found
the key in the lock and turned it. One backward
look he cast at the two figures on the floor and the
man who leaned against the wall, clutching at his
shoulder.

253Policemen seemed to be scarce in that neighborhood,
and Locke found one with difficulty. The
officer listened incredulously to Lefty&#8217;s story.
&#8220;Mike&#8217;s is a quiet place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
make a mistake about where this happened, did
you? Well, come on; we&#8217;ll go round there and
see about it.&#8221;

The saloon was open when they reached it. The
red-headed bartender was serving beer to an Italian
and a Swede. The vagrant had vanished.
The man behind the bar listened with a well-simulated
air of growing indignation when the policeman
questioned him. He glared at the pitcher.

&#8220;What are you tryin&#8217; to put across, bo?&#8221; he
demanded fiercely. &#8220;You never were in here before
in your life. Tryin&#8217; to give my place a bad
name? Nothin&#8217; like what you say ever happened
around here. Nice little yarn about bein&#8217; decoyed
here by some coves that tried to beat you up!
Say, officer, is this a holdup?&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you what he told me,&#8221; said the policeman.

&#8220;In my back room!&#8221; raged the barkeeper.
&#8220;There ain&#8217;t been nobody in there for the last two
hours. Come here an&#8217; have a look.&#8221; He walked
to the door and flung it open.

Skullen and his partners were gone. Even the
broken table had been removed. There was nothing
254
to indicate that a desperate encounter had
taken place there a short time before.

&#8220;You cleaned up in a hurry,&#8221; said Lefty.

At this the barkeeper became still more furious,
and was restrained by the officer, who scowled at
the pitcher even as he held the other back.

&#8220;You don&#8217;t look like you&#8217;d been hitting the pipe,
young feller,&#8221; growled the representative of the
law; &#8220;but that yarn about being attacked by three
men looks funny. Don&#8217;t notice any marks of the
scrap on you. They didn&#8217;t do you much damage,
did they? Say, you must have had a dream!&#8221;

Locke saw the utter folly of any attempt to press
the matter. &#8220;As long as you insist upon looking
at it in that way, officer,&#8221; he returned, with a
touch of contempt that he could not repress,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll have to let it go at that. But I&#8217;ll guarantee
that there are three men somewhere in this
neighborhood who&#8217;ll have to have various portions
of their anatomies patched up by a doctor as the
aftermath of that dream.&#8221;


255CHAPTER XXXILIGHT ON A DARK SPOT

Janet returned from the matinée in a state
of great excitement. &#8220;She&#8217;s here!&#8221; she
cried, bursting in on Lefty. &#8220;You were
right about it! I&#8217;ve seen her!&#8221;

The southpaw gazed in surprise at the flushed
face of his charming wife. &#8220;You mean&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Virginia! I tell you I&#8217;ve seen her!&#8221;

&#8220;When? Where?&#8221;

&#8220;As we were leaving the theater. The lobby
was crowded, and we were in the back of the jam.
Suddenly I saw her over the heads of the people.
She was just getting into an auto that was occupied
by a handsome woman with snow-white hair.
I wasn&#8217;t mistaken; it was Virginia. I couldn&#8217;t
get to her. I tried to call to her, but she didn&#8217;t
hear me. I&#8217;ll never say you were mistaken again,
Lefty. Somehow you seem always to be right.&#8221;

Locke scarcely heard these final words. He
was thinking rapidly. A sudden ray of hope had
struck upon him. Confound it! Where was Stillman?
He sprang to the telephone and called the
Blade office again.

256&#8220;Jack is the one best bet in this emergency,&#8221; he
said, as he waited for the connections to be made.

He got the reporter on the wire, and Stillman
stated that he had not been in the office ten minutes,
and was about to call Lefty. Could he come
up to the Great Eastern right away? Sure.

The feeling of depression and helplessness that
had threatened to crush Locke began to fall away.
The door he had sought, the one door by which
there seemed any chance of passing on to success,
appeared to be almost within reach of his hand.
In her excitement at the theater, Janet had not
possessed the presence of mind to call the attention
of her friends to the snowy-haired woman,
but he knew that she could describe her with some
minuteness.

&#8220;Stillman knows everybody,&#8221; Lefty said. &#8220;It
may be clew enough for him.&#8221;

There was a rap on the door. A messenger boy
appeared with a telegram. Locke ripped it open
and read:


Jones sick. Team busted. I&#8217;m busted. Signal of distress.
How about that five hundred? I knead the dough. Don&#8217;t
shoot! Wire cash.                           Wiley.
 

&#8220;Trouble in another quarter,&#8221; muttered Lefty,
handing the message over to Janet. &#8220;How am I
going to send him that money? I can&#8217;t force
257
Weegman to do it. Wiley has a right to demand
it. If I don&#8217;t come across, he&#8217;ll have a right to
call the deal off.&#8221;

&#8220;But Jones is sick,&#8221; said Janet.

&#8220;Still it was a square bargain, and I mean to
stand by it. Jones is sick. He was sick that day
in Vienna; that was what ailed him. He showed
flashes of form when he braced up, but he was too
ill to brace up long. I&#8217;ve wondered what was the
explanation, now I have it. Get him on his feet
again, and he&#8217;ll be all right. I&#8217;ve got to hold my
grip on Jones somehow.&#8221;

Kennedy and Stillman appeared at the Great
Eastern together. First, Lefty showed them the
message from Cap&#8217;n Wiley. Over it the former
manager screwed up his face, casting a sharp look
at his successor.

&#8220;If you can trust this Wiley,&#8221; he said, &#8220;send
him two hundred, and tell him to bring Jones north
as soon as Jones can travel. Don&#8217;t worry.
Wiley&#8217;s outfit didn&#8217;t come under the national
agreement, and Jones&#8217; name on a Stockings contract
ties him up.&#8221;

&#8220;But without drawing money from the club I
haven&#8217;t the two hundred to spare now. I can&#8217;t
draw.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix that. I&#8217;ve got two hundred or more
that you can borrow. After the training season
258
opens, you&#8217;ll pretty soon find out whether or not
you&#8217;ve picked a dill pickle in your dummy
pitcher.&#8221;

Janet told Stillman about seeing Virginia Collier,
and gave him a fairly minute description of
the woman Virginia was with. The reporter
smoked a cigarette, and considered.

&#8220;I think I can find that lady with the snow-white
hair,&#8221; he said, after a time. &#8220;Leave it to
me. You&#8217;ll hear from me just as soon as I have
something to tell.&#8221;

With a promising air of confidence, he took his
departure, leaving Kennedy and Locke to attend
to the matter of Wiley and Mysterious Jones. Of
course, the southpaw told the old manager all
about Skullen&#8217;s attempt at revenge, but he did not
do so within the hearing of Janet, whom he did
not care to alarm. The veteran chuckled over the
result of the encounter in the back room of Mike&#8217;s
saloon.

&#8220;Right from the first,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you was
picked for something soft and easy. I knew
you was a fighter, son, but Weegman and his gang
didn&#8217;t know it. Mebbe they&#8217;ll begin to guess the
fact pretty soon.&#8221;

A few minutes after eight that evening, Stillman
returned to the hotel and found Locke waiting
with what patience he could command. The
259
reporter wore a smile, but he declined to answer
questions.

&#8220;Mrs. James A. Vanderpool&#8217;s private car is
waiting for us at the door,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bring
Mrs. Hazelton, Lefty. We&#8217;re going to make a
call.&#8221;

&#8220;Mrs. Vanderpool? The widow of the traction
magnate? Why, what&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Now don&#8217;t waste time! Somebody else can
gratify your curiosity a great deal better than I.
In fact, I know so little about the facts at the bottom
of this queer business that any explanations
I&#8217;d make would be likely to ball things up.&#8221;

The magnificent residence of the late James
Vanderpool was on upper Fifth Avenue. They
were ushered into a splendid reception room. In
a few minutes an aristocratic-looking woman with
white hair entered, her appearance bringing an
involuntary exclamation to Janet&#8217;s lips.

&#8220;It&#8217;s the very one!&#8221; she breathed excitedly, her
fingers gripping Lefty&#8217;s arm. Stillman introduced
them to Mrs. Vanderpool, who met them
graciously.

&#8220;Virginia will be down in a minute or two,&#8221;
said the lady. &#8220;For reasons, she has been staying
with me since she returned from abroad. I&#8217;ll let
her tell you about it.&#8221; She regarded Locke with
frank interest, yet in a manner that was not at
260
all embarrassing, for it plainly contained a great
deal of friendliness. &#8220;Virginia has told me much
about you,&#8221; she stated. &#8220;It has never before
been my good fortune to meet a professional baseball
player. My niece is very fond of Mrs. Hazelton.&#8221;

&#8220;Your niece!&#8221; exclaimed Lefty.

&#8220;Virginia is my niece, although I have scarcely
seen her since she was a very small child. Here
she is now.&#8221;

Virginia ran, laughing, to meet Janet. After
the manner of girl friends, they hugged and kissed
each other.

&#8220;Really,&#8221; said Virginia, &#8220;I should give you a
good shaking for not answering all my letters!&#8221;

&#8220;Your letters!&#8221; cried Janet. &#8220;I&#8217;ve received
only two letters from you in goodness knows how
long! I answered them; and wrote you a dozen
to which I got not a word of reply.&#8221;

They gazed at each other in blank uncertainty
for a minute or two, and every trace of laughter
died from Miss Collier&#8217;s face. Her blue eyes began
to flash.

&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;our letters were intercepted.
I can&#8217;t remember whether I posted any of mine
or not, but I was so worried over father that it is
doubtful if I did. I let my maid attend to that.
She nearly always brought the mail to me, too.
261
When I obtained positive proof that she was dishonest,
I discharged her. Even now it&#8217;s hard to
believe she was so treacherous.&#8221;

&#8220;But why should she intercept our letters? I
don&#8217;t understand, Virginia.&#8221;

&#8220;There has been a dreadful plot to ruin my
father. You&#8217;ll hardly believe it when I tell you.
I find it difficult to believe, even now.&#8221; She
shivered, some of the color leaving her face. &#8220;It
was necessary to cut us off from any true information
of what was happening to his business interests.
Letters from you might have given me
an inkling, Janet, and so they were secured and
destroyed before they ever reached my hands.
Other letters met the same fate. Mr. Weegman
declared he wrote several which I know my father
never got.&#8221;

&#8220;Weegman!&#8221; exclaimed Locke incredulously.
&#8220;Why, he&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Doctor Dalmers warned Mr. Weegman that
father must not be disturbed or excited in the least
over business matters. He said such a thing
might have a fatal effect on his heart. Still Weegman
says he wrote guardedly several times, mildly
hinting that things were not going right.&#8221;

&#8220;The liar!&#8221; whispered Lefty to himself.

A bit in the background, Jack Stillman was listening
with keen interest, thinking what a sensational
262
special article the truth regarding this affair
would make.

&#8220;We were surrounded by wretches who had no
compunction,&#8221; declared Virginia Collier. &#8220;It
was I who first suspected them. My father was
too ill, and the doctor kept him under opiates
almost all the time, so that his mind was dulled.
After I discharged Annette I became suspicious
of the nurse. I spoke to Doctor Dalmers about
her, but he insisted that she was all right. He
insisted too earnestly. I began to watch him
without letting him realize I was doing so. Once
or twice I found a chance to change father&#8217;s medicine
for harmless powders and clear water, and
it seemed to me that he was better than when he
took the medicine. He was very weak and ill, but
his mind seemed clearer. I kept the medicine
away from him for two days in succession, and
got an opportunity to talk to him alone. I succeeded
in convincing him that the change of climate,
the baths, and the stuff the doctor had given
him were doing him no good at all. In London
there was a physician whom he knew and in whom
he had confidence, Doctor Robert Fitzgerald. I
urged him to go to Doctor Fitzgerald, but not to
tell Doctor Dalmers of his intention, and I begged
him to refuse to take any more of Doctor Dalmers&#8217;
medicine. We were in Luchon, and all the way
263
to London I had to watch like a hawk to keep that
medicine from father, but I succeeded, although
I became extremely unpopular with Doctor Dalmers.
The minute we reached London, I went to
Doctor Fitzgerald and told him all that I suspected.
Although he could not believe such a
thing possible, he accompanied me at once to our
hotel. Doctor Dalmers was taken by surprise,
for he had not anticipated this move. When I
discharged both him and the nurse, he gave me
a terrible look. Of course, I could not have carried
this through, had not Doctor Fitzgerald been
a close friend of my father. Dalmers called Fitzgerald&#8217;s
action unprofessional, and made threats,
but we got rid of him.&#8221;

Despite the fact that she was such a mere slip
of a girl, it was evident that she possessed brains
and the courage and resourcefulness to use them.
Mrs. Vanderpool seemed very proud of her.
Lefty expressed his admiration.

&#8220;I knew,&#8221; Virginia continued, &#8220;that there must
be something behind such a plot. I did not believe
Dalmers had put it through merely to bleed
my father while keeping him ill. I was worried
over the fact that we knew so very little concerning
how father&#8217;s affairs were going over here.
What information we could get by cable or otherwise
might be unsatisfactory. So I determined
264
to come home and investigate for myself. I got
father&#8217;s consent, and I left him in Doctor Fitzgerald&#8217;s
care. I intended to sail by the Victoria,
but there was a misunderstanding about accommodations,
and I was forced to take a later ship.
I find father&#8217;s affairs involved, and I&#8217;ve sent a
statement of conditions as they appear to be.

&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she concluded, smiling a little, &#8220;I
was greatly relieved to learn from Mr. Weegman
that he felt sure he had blocked the contemptible
efforts to smash the Blue Stockings. He felt
highly elated over signing Lefty Locke as manager.&#8221;

&#8220;Miss Collier,&#8221; said the pitcher, &#8220;did Weegman
offer an explanation of the raid on the team?
Did he say who was at the bottom of it?&#8221;

Instantly a little cloud came to her face, and an
expression of regret appeared in her eyes.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;He told me. At first I
could not believe it.&#8221;

Stillman leaned forward, listening, his lips
slightly parted. Locke turned toward him, but
turned back quickly, with another question on his
lips. Virginia was speaking again, however.

&#8220;I can scarcely believe it now,&#8221; she said sadly.
&#8220;It seems too utterly impossible! I can&#8217;t imagine
any one being such a scoundrel&#8211;much less him!
But Weegman has made sure; he has the proof.
265
Of course, he has told you all about it, Lefty; it
was necessary that you should know.&#8221; Her manner
had grown deeply dejected.

&#8220;What did Weegman tell you?&#8221; asked the
southpaw. &#8220;Who did he say was responsible for
what had happened to the Blue Stockings?&#8221;

With an effort the girl answered: &#8220;Franklin
Parlmee!&#8221;


266CHAPTER XXXIIONE CHANCE

It was like a staggering blow. While it confirmed
Stillman&#8217;s theory that Parlmee was
the chief rascal of the conspiracy, it shattered
the supposition that Weegman, a blind dupe,
wholly unaware of the truth, was being cleverly
manipulated as an unconscious tool. The foundation
of that hypothesis melted away like sand before
hydrolytic force.

Locke turned again and looked at the reporter.
The latter, standing like an image of stone, was
staring questioningly and incredulously at Virginia
Collier. He, too, realized that this confirmation
of his belief had brought a portion of the
postulation fluttering down like a house of cards,
and he was seeking a mental readjustment.

Janet, frozen with lips slightly parted and eyes
wide, was aware of it also. She was about to
speak impulsively when Lefty detected her and
made a repressing gesture.

Miss Collier felt that she knew the reason for
the sudden silence that had fallen on every one,
and a faint flush crept back into her cheeks. She
267
appeared to be humiliated and ashamed, as well as
sorrowful.

&#8220;I understand,&#8221; she said, in a low tone, &#8220;how
it must seem to you to hear me say such a thing
about Mr. Parlmee. I have trusted him. I believed
in him, even when my father was losing
faith and confidence. I clung to my own faith, and
it hasn&#8217;t been easy to abandon it, even in the face
of proof. My conscience or something taunts me
occasionally. I&#8211;I&#8217;ve cried over it, and I&#8217;ve
fought against it. I haven&#8217;t dared see him since
my return&#8211;since I found out the truth&#8211;for I
knew I should listen to him and believe in him in
spite of everything. I wanted to face him and
accuse him, but Weegman persuaded me to wait.
He said it would merely hasten the crash if we let
the scoundrels know they were suspected.&#8221;

&#8220;The scoundrels!&#8221; exclaimed Locke. &#8220;Then
he told you that more than one was concerned?&#8221;

&#8220;He claims that a man named Garrity is operating
in conjunction with Franklin Parlmee.&#8221;

Another staggerer. To Virginia, Weegman
had accused Garrity. Mutely the southpaw appealed
to Stillman. The reporter&#8217;s forehead was
puckered in a puzzled manner; he caught Lefty&#8217;s
glance, and shook his head slowly.

&#8220;When did he name Garrity, Miss Collier?&#8221; he
asked.

268&#8220;When he called on me to-day&#8211;this afternoon,&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;He has been at work trying to
get at the truth.&#8221;

Locke improved the opportunity to whisper in
Janet&#8217;s ear: &#8220;Keep still! Don&#8217;t say a word&#8211;now.&#8221;

Although she did not understand why he wished
her to keep silent, she nodded. He had been right
in other matters; it was best to let him have his
way in this.

&#8220;My niece has been very much upset,&#8221; said
Mrs. Vanderpool. &#8220;It has practically made her
ill. She hasn&#8217;t felt much like seeing people, and
therefore Mr. Weegman&#8217;s advice to keep quiet was
easy to follow.&#8221;

Weegman had urged Virginia to remain in obscurity,
not to let her friends know she was in New
York; that was evident. He had convinced her
that by doing so she could best assist him in his
pretended task of trapping the conspirators. And
while she kept quiet, those conspirators were hastening
to carry through the work they had planned.

&#8220;Miss Collier,&#8221; said Lefty, &#8220;do you think it
would be possible for your father to come home
at once? Do you think he is strong enough to
stand the voyage? If he can do so, he had better
come. He should be here now.&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she replied.

269&#8220;Give me his address and let me communicate
with him,&#8221; Locke urged. &#8220;He should know something
of the truth, at least.&#8221;

Virginia was persuaded, for Mrs. Vanderpool
agreed that it was the best course to pursue. The
southpaw was elated; he felt that at last he was
getting a grip that would enable him to accomplish
something. If he could baffle the rascals now, it
would be a feat worth while.

Mrs. Vanderpool was called away to the telephone.

&#8220;Auntie has been very kind to me, in spite of
her quarrel with father,&#8221; said Virginia, when the
lady had left the room. &#8220;They have not spoken
to each other for years. It is so ridiculous, so
childish, for a brother and sister who have been
devoted! Both are stubborn. And yet Aunt
Elizabeth is the kindest, gentlest woman in the
world. She lost an only daughter, and she says
I seem to fill the vacant place. She has made me
feel very much at home.&#8221;

Then she began chatting with Janet about things
of mutual interest. Locke joined Stillman, who
had walked to the far end of the room.

&#8220;This Weegman is either a fool or much cleverer
than we thought him,&#8221; said the reporter swiftly,
in a low tone. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s a fool.&#8221;

&#8220;How have you figured it out?&#8221; Lefty questioned.
270
&#8220;It was a mistake to think him not wise
to Parlmee. And why, if he is hand in glove with
Garrity, did he tell her that Garrity was concerned
in the miserable business?&#8221;

&#8220;He told her that to-day?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes.&#8221;

&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he tell her before? Weegman is
in town. Have you seen him?&#8221;

The pitcher told of his meeting with both Weegman
and Garrity, and how he had defied them.
Stillman&#8217;s face cleared a little.

&#8220;Look here, Locke, that fellow Weegman will
double cross any one. You put him next to the
fact that you were wise to Garrity. The whole
bunch must know that Collier has fired his crooked
doctor. Of course, Dalmers notified them. After
talking with you, Weegman began to realize that
the whole plot might fall through. He lost no time
in beginning to hedge his bets. He&#8217;s trying to fix
it so that he&#8217;ll fall safe if the business blows up.&#8221;

&#8220;But why did he tell her of Parlmee? We
thought he didn&#8217;t know about that.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m not as sure about Parlmee as I was,&#8221; admitted
the reporter frankly. &#8220;Weegman has been
trying to blacken him to her right along. I&#8217;ll own
up now that it was an anonymous communication
that first put me on the track of Parlmee. There
have been others of the same sort tending to incriminate
271
him. I&#8217;ve wondered where they came
from. Now I think I know. Weegman is the answer.&#8221;

&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaimed Lefty. &#8220;You believe it
was he who directed suspicion toward Parlmee in
the first place?&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me. That being the case, instead
of being a dupe, this Weegman has put something
over that we didn&#8217;t suspect him of. He&#8217;s after
Collier&#8217;s daughter, and it would help him if he
could turn her against his rival.&#8221;

Locke&#8217;s face cleared. His relief was evident.

&#8220;This is all speculation,&#8221; said the reporter
hastily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be too quick to accept it as a settled
fact. Parlmee&#8217;s behavior has been suspicious
enough to require some explaining from him. Perhaps
he can clear it up. We know Weegman has
tried to put the Blue Stockings on the blink, and
we&#8217;re dead certain he hasn&#8217;t knowingly done so as
the assistant of Parlmee. Now how do you figure
on that?&#8221;

&#8220;Parlmee&#8217;s innocent, as I fancied. Weegman
is the chief rascal.&#8221;

Stillman smiled. &#8220;In which case he&#8217;s beginning
to find himself caught in a quicksand, and he&#8217;s
trying to save himself by climbing out over his
pal, Garrity. He&#8217;ll swear he had no finger in it.
Garrity won&#8217;t dare accuse Weegman of being an
272
accomplice, for by doing that he would acknowledge
that there was a conspiracy. Weegman is in
no danger in that direction of anything further
than such private revenge as Garrity may seek to
take.&#8221;

Lefty turned back and approached Virginia and
Janet, addressing the former:

&#8220;Miss Collier, I want you to promise me that,
for the present, at least, you&#8217;ll say nothing to
Bailey Weegman about having seen and talked
with me.&#8221;

The girl looked surprised. &#8220;I was just proposing
that Janet should leave the hotel and stay
here with me. I know my aunt will approve.&#8221;

&#8220;I approve anything you may wish, my dear,&#8221;
said Mrs. Vanderpool, reëntering the room. &#8220;It
would give me great pleasure to have Mrs. Hazelton
visit us and remain as long as possible.&#8221;

Locke looked doubtful, for should that arrangement
be carried out Janet might easily be led into
telling Virginia more than it seemed advisable for
her to know at the present time. But Mrs. Vanderpool
made her invitation most cordial, and
Janet gave him a beseeching glance. He wavered.

&#8220;Weegman calls here. If he should&#8211;&#8221;

Janet&#8217;s hand fell on his arm. &#8220;Trust me,&#8221; she
urged significantly. &#8220;You can&#8217;t hope to keep him
long in the dark. For the present, if he calls, I&#8217;ll
273
not be in evidence. You&#8217;re so busy that I see very
little of you during the day, anyway.&#8221;

So he was won over. Janet returned with him
to the hotel to gather up the belongings she would
need, and Stillman accompanied them. Lefty
made his wife understand how desirous it was to
keep Weegman blinded as long as possible, explaining
that he feared Miss Collier&#8217;s indignation
would lead her into betraying everything should
she learn the whole truth regarding the two-faced
schemer.

&#8220;If you can get Collier home quickly enough,
Locke,&#8221; said Stillman, &#8220;there&#8217;s a chance that you
may be able to spike the enemy&#8217;s guns, even at
this late hour.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make a swift play for that
chance,&#8221; returned Lefty.


274CHAPTER XXXIIIONE IN A MILLION

The clerk of the Great Eastern surveyed
with interest the swarthy small man in
the bright green suit and the plaid raglan
overcoat, who leaned an elbow on the desk and
jauntily twirled a light cane, puffing at an excellent
Havana cigar.

&#8220;Beyond a modicum of a doubt you have me,
your excellency,&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;I&#8217;m the
real thing, the only and original Cap&#8217;n Wiley. It
is frequently embarrassing to be encumbered by
fame, and my modesty often compels me to travel
incog-nit-o; but just now, having a yearning desire
to hobnob with my old college chump, Lefty
Locke, I am blushingly compelled to reveal my
identity. When Lefty learns that I am here he
will fly like a bird to greet me. Notify one of yon
brass-buttoned minions to inform him of my immediate
proximity.&#8221;

&#8220;Mr. Locke is out at present,&#8221; said the man
behind the desk, winking slyly at a fellow clerk;
&#8220;but if you will leave your card&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;If one isn&#8217;t sufficient, I&#8217;ll leave the whole pack
275
of fifty-two. It is my habit to carry a deck with
me for emergencies. Perchance, however, you can
tell me when Lefty is liable to return.&#8221;

At that moment Locke, coming in, saw the sailor,
and hurried forward. The Marine Marvel teetered
to meet him, beaming broadly. They shook
hands, and Locke drew the sailor toward two vacant
chairs.

&#8220;Jones?&#8221; questioned Lefty as they sat down.
&#8220;Where is he? How is he?&#8221;

&#8220;He&#8217;s right here in this little old burg,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;Nothing short of his demise could have
prevented me from keeping my agreement to deliver
him to you. He is on the mend, and it is
probable that he&#8217;ll soon be as frisky and formidable
as ever. But I have qualms. I fear greatly
that something has happened to cause Jonesy to
lose interest in baseball forever and for aye.
Were I in his boots, I&#8217;d go on one long spree that
would reach from here to Hongkong, and even
farther. Hold your breath, Lefty, and hold it
hard. Jones has come into a modest little fortune
of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or thereabouts.&#8221;

&#8220;Quite a joke!&#8221; said the pitcher.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you for doubting me. In your
place I&#8217;d have made a remark a shade more violent.
But the seal of voracity is on my lips. I
276
didn&#8217;t know it when I saw you last, but at that
time he had practically sold his interest in his
Alaska possessions. I have stated the sum he received
for his share in that pretty bit of property.&#8221;

&#8220;Enough to keep him in pin money for some
time,&#8221; replied Lefty, still skeptical.

&#8220;If he could be induced to use it for his own
wants he could dodge becoming a pauper for quite
a while. But, Lefty, you can&#8217;t guess what he&#8217;s
going to do with it. Excuse me while I sigh. I
have argued and pleaded until my fingers became
tongue-tied; but I&#8217;ve failed to move him from his
fixed determination. He is going to give every
dollar of that money away!&#8221;

Of course, Locke thought that Wiley was drawing
the long bow, as usual. &#8220;I hope he won&#8217;t
overlook his friends when he passes it around,&#8221;
he said, smiling.

&#8220;His friends won&#8217;t get a dollar!&#8221; declared
Wiley. &#8220;He&#8217;s going to give it to his enemies.&#8221;

This was too much for the southpaw. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
cut the comedy,&#8221; he urged.

The sailor gave him a chastening look. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t comedy; it&#8217;s tragedy, Lefty. He believes it
his duty. He believes he is bound, as a man of
honor, to do it. Listen and I will elucidate. Did
277
you ever hear of the Central Yucatan Rubber Company?&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, it was a fraudulent concern that flourished
like a green bay tree some seven or eight
years ago, and withered like a fragile plant when
the government got after it for fraudulent use of
the mails. Like many such grafting stock-selling
companies, it had a dummy board of officers who
appeared to be in control, while the real rogues
who were harvesting the coin kept in the background.
Jones was president of that company.
He believed it to be on the level, and he had invested
some of his own money&#8211;superficially all
he had&#8211;in it. When the government got busy,
Jones was indicted as the head of the concern.
He was thought to be the originator of the scheme.
The real crook had fixed it so that he seemed to
be one of the innocent victims, and he helped swear
Jones into prison. Jones got five years. He
served his time.&#8221;

At last Locke was impressed. He had never
seen Wiley so serious. For once, the flippant and
superficial manner of the swarthy little man had
been discarded; his flamboyant style of speech had
been dropped. Ordinarily he gave one the impression
that he was gleefully fabricating; now, of a
278
sudden, the listener was convinced that he was
hearing the naked truth. It explained the atmosphere
of somber sadness, the appearance of brooding
over a great injustice, which had infolded the
mysterious dumb pitcher of the Wind Jammers.
For Jones Lefty felt a throb of genuine sympathy.

&#8220;With the unclothed eye I can perceive that you
get me,&#8221; the sailor continued. &#8220;You can imagine
how you would feel if you had been sent to the
jug for five years, as punishment for a crime perpetrated
by somebody else. What if the one who
concocted the scheme and benefited by it swore
your liberty away and escaped scot-free himself?&#8221;

&#8220;It was monstrous!&#8221; exclaimed the pitcher.

&#8220;Precisely so. In prison Jones took a foolish
oath. He registered a vow to pay back every dollar
to those who had lost their good money in that
fake rubber company. He didn&#8217;t know how he
was going to do it, but he was determined that he
would. In a way, they were his enemies, for they
had helped prosecute him; the courts had adjudged
him guilty, and he felt that he could never hold
up his head as an honest man until those who had
been defrauded got the last cent of coin back. In
some way he must acquire a huge amount of filthy
lucre, and acquire it honestly. He dreamed of
gold mines. When the prison spat him forth he
made his way up into Alaska. There his dream
279
came true, for, with his partners, he located and
developed a great mine. They could have sold out
a dozen times, but never for a sum that would
permit Jones to accomplish his purpose with his
share of the price. So he held on. And at last
a syndicate made an offer that was sufficient.
Jones was notified by his partners. He accepted.
But not until the deal was put through and he had
the certified check for his interest in his clutches
did he breathe a word of it to any one. Then he
told me. He was sick, but his success helped cure
him. He was eager to hurry North and set into
action the machinery for distributing that money
to the rubber company&#8217;s victims. At this very moment
he is interviewing a reputable firm of lawyers
and giving them instructions to proceed about
the work. He can supply a full list of the persons
defrauded. They&#8217;ll get back what they lost, and
Jones will find himself poor again&#8211;but satisfied.&#8221;

Lefty&#8217;s eyes were shining. &#8220;In these days of
the great American idea of grafting and fraud,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;a man with a conscience like Jones&#8217; is
one in ten thousand.&#8221;

&#8220;Say, rather, one in a million, mate. I have
reviled him extemporaneously. I have told him
that he is a fool. I&#8217;m honest myself&#8211;when it&#8217;s
absolutely necessary. But to part with a scandalous
sum like two hundred and fifty thousand without
280
being positively compelled to do so&#8211;oh, pardon
me while I sob!&#8221;

&#8220;A man with such principles, and Jones&#8217; ability
to pitch, will not come to grief. He has a job before
him with the Blue Stockings.&#8221;

Wiley shook his head. &#8220;Apprehension percheth
upon me, Lefty. Jones has accomplished the
great purpose of his life. It was what fired him
and spurred him on. I regret to elucidate that
since that money came to him he has displayed no
interest whatever in baseball. When I sought to
make him talk about it he wouldn&#8217;t even wigwag
a finger on the subject. Something seems to tell
me that he&#8217;ll never again ascend the mound and
shoot the horsehide over the pentagon.&#8221;


281CHAPTER XXXIVWEEGMAN&#8217;S PROPOSAL

For four days Weegman had not troubled
Locke, four days during which Lefty
sought in vain to get some word from
Charles Collier. His cablegrams remained unanswered.
At the time when he had felt the most
sanguine he seemed to find himself blocked again.
He did not seek to delude himself with the belief
that silence on the part of the conspirators meant
they were inactive. Doubtless they were at work
harder than ever. What were they doing? He
confessed that he would give a great deal to know.

Then Weegman reappeared. His manner was
ingratiating. His chuckle seemed intended to be
genial and friendly.

&#8220;A private room where we can talk without the
slightest chance of being overheard, that&#8217;s what
we want,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your own room should be
all right, as long as your wife is stopping with
Miss Collier and her aunt.&#8221; He knew about that.
How long he had known was a question.

Locke felt like turning the rascal down flatly.
He was on the verge of doing so when something
282
led him to decide differently. Perhaps a little patience
and cleverness would enable him to get an
inkling of what the enemy was doing. He took
Weegman to his room, and shot the door bolt behind
them when they had entered.

&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Collier&#8217;s private secretary.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be interrupted by anybody.
I took a great deal of pains that no one who knew
me should see me come here. Garrity mustn&#8217;t
get wise. He ordered me to keep away from
you.&#8221; Laughing, he flung himself down on a
chair.

&#8220;Garrity!&#8221; cried Lefty, astonished at the confession.
&#8220;Then you admit that you are taking
your orders from him?&#8221;

&#8220;He thinks I am,&#8221; was the grinning answer.
&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;ll find himself fooled. If you and I
can get together, I&#8217;m sure he will.&#8221;

Locke stifled a sense of repulsion. The man
was more detestable than ever. It did not appear
possible, and yet he still seemed to think that Locke
would accept a proposal from him.

&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221; asked the pitcher, with
masterly self-control. &#8220;Get together how?&#8221;

&#8220;I hope you realize you can&#8217;t do anything alone.
The combination against you is too strong, and too
much had been done before you began to get wise
to the situation. Let me tell you now that I didn&#8217;t
283
expect this affair would go as far as it has when
I entered into it.&#8221;

The creature was shamelessly acknowledging
his participation in the plot, chuckling as he did
so. Lefty waited.

&#8220;Of course,&#8221; pursued Weegman, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been
aware for some time of my unbounded admiration
and regard for Miss Collier. The old man favored
me, but I couldn&#8217;t bring her round. To do so, I
decided, it would be necessary for me to accomplish
a coup. If I could apparently save her
father from ruin she might alter her views. Out
of gratitude she might marry me. I&#8217;m a man who
gets what he wants, by hook or crook. Garrity approached
me with a scheme. I listened to it. I
believed I saw a way to turn that scheme to my
own advantage with Virginia. But I&#8217;ll tell you
now that it never was my intention to put Charles
Collier wholly on the blink. At that time even I
didn&#8217;t know how badly involved he was.&#8221;

Even while he told the truth in a way, Weegman
was lying in the effort to palliate his act to some
degree. His conscience was warped to such an
extent that he seemed to believe there could be an
excuse for the milder forms of conspiracy and
crime. In a bungling way he was actually making
a bid for Locke&#8217;s sympathy.

&#8220;You must have known of the dastardly arrangement
284
with a crooked doctor to keep Mr. Collier
drugged into apparent illness and detain him
in Europe beyond reach of the friends who might
tell him, Weegman. Who got to that doctor and
bought him up?&#8221;

&#8220;Not I,&#8221; was the denial. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have the
money.&#8221;

&#8220;Was it Garrity?&#8221;

&#8220;Of course. Garrity had something on Dalmers,
who was concerned in some mighty shady
practices at one time. But he told me that Dalmers
was simply going to keep watch of the old
man. I didn&#8217;t know anything about the drugging
business. When I found that out I was mad as
blazes.&#8221;

The southpaw fought to prevent his lips from
curling with scorn, and to suppress a look of triumph
in his eyes. &#8220;What&#8217;s your proposition to
me, Weegman?&#8221;

The self-acknowledged rascal seemed to hesitate.
&#8220;You&#8217;re sure no one can hear us?&#8221; he
asked, his eyes roving around the room.

&#8220;You can see that we&#8217;re quite alone.&#8221;

Weegman drummed nervously on the arm of his
chair. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry this thing has gone so far,&#8221;
he protested. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t look for it to, at first. I
got involved and couldn&#8217;t back out. In fact, Garrity
threatened me when I showed signs of holding
285
back. That,&#8221; he declared, with an attempt at
indignant resentment, &#8220;made me sore. Without
my help in the beginning he never could have done
a thing. Now he thinks he&#8217;s got me foul, he&#8217;s
going to gobble everything. We&#8217;ll see about that!
Perhaps it isn&#8217;t too late to stop him. Maybe we
can do it, you and I. I&#8217;d like to show him.&#8221;

So the rascals had quarreled over the division
of the spoils, as rascals so often do. And now
one of them was ready to betray the other, if he
could do so without disaster to himself. At the
same time, he hoped to make an alliance with Lefty
by which he might reap some actual benefit from
his underhanded work. Suddenly Locke thought
of another man who had been suspected of complicity.

&#8220;How about Parlmee?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Where
does he fit in? Did Garrity send him over the
pond to wrench the control of the Blue Stockings
from Collier?&#8221;

&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what Garrity has been doing with
Parlmee,&#8221; Weegman confessed. &#8220;It was natural
that I should want to turn Virginia against Parlmee,
but I swear I didn&#8217;t know he was in this
thing when I got the idea of making her believe
he was. That was an inspiration that came to me
all of a sudden. I had to keep her away from him.
I faked up some evidence. She refused to believe
286
at first. Then, by Jove, I found out that Garrity
and Parlmee were really up to something.
They&#8217;ve had dealings.&#8221;

Lefty&#8217;s heart, which had bounded high for a
moment, sank heavily. After all, could it be true
that two cleverer scoundrels had combined to work
Weegman as a dupe? Had the confirmation of
this fact helped Weegman to make up his mind to
go back on Garrity? Was it not possible that
this was the real cause of the quarrel between the
worthy pair?

The southpaw continued to lead the other on.
&#8220;What is Garrity&#8217;s scheme? What has he told
you that he proposed to do?&#8221;

&#8220;Unless Collier receives outside assistance,
Garrity&#8217;s got him cornered. Collier has met reverses
generally. Garrity has got hold of a certain
amount of Blue Stocking stock. Collier still
holds enough to keep the balance of power, but he
won&#8217;t hold it long. If he tries to his interest in
the Northern Can Company will go to glory. Garrity
has placed himself in a position to shake the
old man out of that concern. If Collier loses that,
he&#8217;s broke&#8211;a pauper. He can&#8217;t hang on, because
he hasn&#8217;t the ready resources. He&#8217;ll have to sell
his Blue Stockings stock to save Northern Can.
If he had a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in
ready cash he could pull through. It&#8217;ll take half
287
of that to oust Garrity from Northern Can, and
the other half is needed for the team. Garrity
will put it up to him to-morrow. In the meantime,
can you and I raise one hundred and fifty
thousand?&#8221;

&#8220;You and I!&#8221; cried Lefty. &#8220;Not a dollar!
Not a cent! How will Garrity put it up to Collier
to-morrow? Collier is in&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Philadelphia!&#8221; cut in Weegman sharply.

The southpaw stared, thunderstruck. &#8220;Philadelphia!
You mean that he&#8217;s in this country?&#8221;

&#8220;He arrived to-day, and took a train at once for
Philadelphia. I cabled him to come, and to keep
his coming secret. Those were Garrity&#8217;s orders.&#8221;

Locke sat down heavily, still staring at Weegman.


288CHAPTER XXXVTHE SHATTERING STROKE

That explained it. Now Lefty knew why
he had received no answer to his cablegrams.
Before the first was sent,
Charles Collier was on the high seas, bound for
America. He was home, and Garrity held him in
the hollow of his hand. On the morrow the owner
of the Blue Stockings was to feel the crushing grip
of the triumphant schemer.

Weegman watched the southpaw&#8217;s face, noting
the look of consternation upon it. Suddenly snapping
his fingers, he began speaking again:
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I came to you, Locke. What&#8217;s done
must be done quickly. After eleven o&#8217;clock to-morrow
it will be too late. You know what that
means for you. Garrity hates you like poison,
and you won&#8217;t last any time after he gets control.
You can raise that money.&#8221;

&#8220;A hundred and fifty thousand dollars! You&#8217;re
crazy!&#8221;

&#8220;You can do it, and save yourself. If you&#8217;ll do
the right thing by me, I&#8217;ll tell you how to raise the
needful. Together we&#8217;ll hand Garrity his bumps.
289
What do you say? Is it a go?&#8221; He sprang up
and approached, his hand extended.

Locke rose and faced him. The scorn and contempt
upon his face would have withered a man
less calloused. Weegman recoiled a little, and his
hand dropped to his side.

&#8220;Weegman,&#8221; Lefty said, &#8220;you&#8217;re the most
treacherous scoundrel I ever had the bad fortune
to meet. You&#8217;re just about as trustworthy as a
rattlesnake. Heaven knows I need money, and I
certainly want to hold my job, but not even to save
my own father and mother from being turned out
of the home that has sheltered them so long would
I enter into any sort of partnership with you.&#8221;

A look of astonished wrath contorted Weegman&#8217;s
features, and a snarling laugh broke from
his lips. &#8220;You poor fool!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
thrown away your last chance! I did think you
would know enough to save yourself, but I see you
haven&#8217;t an atom of sense in your head.&#8221;

There was something almost pitying in the
smile Lefty gave him. Something, also, that
caused the man a sudden throb of apprehension.

&#8220;You&#8217;re the fool, Weegman,&#8221; returned the
southpaw. &#8220;You have confessed the whole rotten
scheme. You have betrayed yourself and your
fellow conspirator, Garrity.&#8221;

&#8220;Bah!&#8221; the rascal flung back, snapping his
290
fingers again. &#8220;What good will it do you? I&#8217;ll
deny everything. You can&#8217;t prove a thing. I was
careful that there should be no witnesses, no one
to hear a word that passed between us.&#8221;

Locke grabbed him by the wrist, and snapped
him round with a jerk, facing one wall of the room.
&#8220;And I,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;took care that every word
we uttered should be heard by two reliable persons.
I set the trap for Garrity, but I have been
unable to decoy him into it. You walked into it
unbidden. Look!&#8221;

With two strides he reached a dresser that stood
against the wall. He seized it and moved it aside.
With one finger he pointed to a small, square,
black object that clung to the wall two feet from
the floor.

&#8220;Look!&#8221; he commanded again.

Weegman stared uncomprehendingly, yet with
the perspiration of dread beginning to bead his
forehead.

&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked huskily.

&#8220;A dictograph!&#8221; answered Lefty. &#8220;I had it
put in two days ago. When you met me a short
time ago and asked for a private interview I
started to turn you down. Then I saw old Jack
Kennedy and Stillman, the reporter, in the background.
They gave me a signal. Thirty seconds
after we entered this room they were in the room
291
adjoining, listening by means of that dictograph to
every word that passed between us. We&#8217;ve got
you, Weegman, and we&#8217;ve got Garrity, too. Criminal
conspiracy is a rather serious matter.&#8221;

All the defiance had faded from Bailey Weegman&#8217;s
eyes. He trembled; he could not command
even a ghost of a laugh. He started violently,
and gasped, as there came a sharp rap on the door.

&#8220;They want to take another good look at you to
clinch matters so that they can make oath to your
identity,&#8221; said Locke, swiftly crossing and flinging
the door open. &#8220;Come in, gentlemen!&#8221;

Kennedy and Stillman entered. Weegman cowered
before them. They regarded him disdainfully.

&#8220;You beaned him all right, Lefty,&#8221; said the ex-manager.
&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t looking for the curve you
put over that time.&#8221;

The reporter paused to light a cigarette.
&#8220;After your arrest, Weegman,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I advise
you to make haste to turn State&#8217;s evidence. It&#8217;s
your only chance to escape doing a nice long bit in
the stone jug.&#8221; He turned, closed the door behind
him, and shot the bolt again. &#8220;In the meantime,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;I think we can persuade you to
refrain from warning Garrity regarding what is
coming to him shortly after eleven o&#8217;clock to-morrow.&#8221;

292Looking feeble and broken, Charles Collier sat
at his desk in the office of the Blue Stockings Baseball
Club. On the desk before him lay the books
of the club and a mass of letters and documents.
At one end of the desk sat Tom Garrity, smoking
a big cigar and looking like a Napoleon who
dreamed of no impending Waterloo. He was
speaking. His words and manner were those of a
conqueror.

&#8220;You can see how the land lies, Collier. You
should have sold out your interest in the team
before going abroad. Weegman made a mess of
it. To-day you can&#8217;t realize fifty cents on the dollar.
I&#8217;ve offered you my Northern Can stock for
your holdings. That&#8217;s the best way out for you
now. If you refuse you&#8217;ll lose Northern Can and
the team, both. Better save one by sacrificing the
other.&#8221;

Collier wearily lifted a protesting hand. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t have to repeat it, Garrity; I know you&#8217;ve
got me cornered. I&#8217;m merely waiting for Weegman.
He promised to be here at eleven. It&#8217;s past
that hour.&#8221;

Without asking permission, Garrity reached for
the desk phone. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call in my lawyers,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be here in a few minutes.&#8221;

Before he could lift the receiver from the hook
293
the door swung open, and Weegman came in, pale
and shrinking. At his heels followed Locke, Kennedy,
and Stillman. With an astonished exclamation,
Garrity put the instrument down.

&#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t intrude,&#8221; said Lefty, smiling
on the startled owner of the Rockets. &#8220;Having
learned from Weegman of this little business meeting,
we decided to drop in. I&#8217;m very glad to see
that you have arrived home in time, Mr. Collier.&#8221;

&#8220;Too late!&#8221; sighed the hopeless man at the desk.
&#8220;Too late! You&#8217;re just in time to witness the
transference of the Blue Stockings to Garrity.&#8221;

&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; returned the southpaw easily,
&#8220;we have come to purchase Mr. Garrity&#8217;s Blue
Stockings stock at the prevailing price. Likewise
his interest in Northern Can.&#8221;

Garrity rose, his face purple with wrath. A tremendously
explosive ejaculation burst from his
lips. &#8220;What in blazes do you mean?&#8221; he roared.

&#8220;Just what I have said,&#8221; Locke answered
calmly. &#8220;Since arriving in town I have made arrangements
for this little business matter. I have
opened an account with the New Market National
by depositing a certified check for one hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, which is more than
enough to make the purchases mentioned. Mr.
Collier&#8217;s attorney will arrive in ten minutes or so
294
to see that everything is done in a legal manner.&#8221;

&#8220;But you can&#8217;t buy a dollar&#8217;s worth of my holdings
in either concern.&#8221;

&#8220;You may think so now. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll change
your mind in a few moments. It is also reported
that, for the good of the game, you&#8217;ll get out of
organized baseball. Have you brought a copy of
the second edition of the Morning Blade with you,
Stillman? Show it to Mr. Garrity, please.&#8221;

The reporter drew a newspaper from his pocket,
opened it, passed it to Garrity. One finger indicated
a half-column article, with headlines.


GARRITY TO GET OUT.

WILL DISPOSE OF HIS INTERESTS IN THE ROCKETS AND
ABANDON BASEBALL.
HINTS OF A CONSPIRACY TO WRECK THE BLUE
STOCKINGS.
 

Garrity&#8217;s eyes glared. His breath whistled
through his nostrils. His wrath was volcanic.
&#8220;Somebody&#8217;ll pay for that!&#8221; he shouted, swinging
his ponderous fist above his head like a sledge
hammer. &#8220;What&#8217;s it mean?&#8221;

&#8220;It means,&#8221; answered Stillman, &#8220;that more will
follow, giving complete details of the conspiracy&#8211;unless you decide to quit baseball for the good
of the game.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll institute a suit for libel!&#8221;

295&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t. You won&#8217;t dare. We&#8217;ve got
the goods on you. Let me tell you how it happened.&#8221;
He did so with unrepressed satisfaction,
and the man&#8217;s air of bluster gradually evaporated
as he listened. But he gave Weegman a murderous
look.

The door swung open again, and a sharp-faced
little man entered briskly.

&#8220;Here&#8217;s Mr. Collier&#8217;s attorney,&#8221; said Lefty.
&#8220;Now we can get down to real business.&#8221;


296CHAPTER XXXVITHE TEST OF MYSTERIOUS JONES

The unscrupulous Garrity had long been a
menace to organized baseball, but such efforts
as had been made to jar him loose
from it had failed. At last, however, like a remorseless
hunter, he was caught in a trap of his
own setting. Twist and squirm as he might, the
jaws of that trap held him fast. Even when the
representatives of a syndicate met him by agreement
to take the team over at a liberal price, he
showed a disposition to balk. Stillman was there.
He handed Garrity a carbon copy of a special article
giving a complete and accurate statement of
the conspiracy.

&#8220;If you own the Rockets to-morrow morning,&#8221;
said the reporter, &#8220;that will appear, word for
word, in the Blade. Criminal action against you
will be begun at the same time.&#8221;

Upon the following day Garrity was no longer
interested in the Rockets.

The Blade had put over a scoop by being the
first paper to announce that Garrity would retire.
It could have created a tremendous sensation by
297
publishing the inside facts relative to the method
by which he had been forced out. But organized
baseball was under fire, and already the suspicious
public was beginning to regard it askance. The
menacing Federals were making no end of trouble.
The cry of &#8220;rottenness&#8221; was in the air. Through
the publication of the story thousands of hasty,
unthinking patrons could be led to believe that,
square and honest though it seemed to be on the
field, the game was really rotten at the core. Stillman
knew how that would hurt, and he loved the
game. He was tempted to the limit, but he resisted.
Not even his editor ever found out just
how much he knew and suppressed.

On the usual date the Blue Stockings went South
for spring training. Old Jack Kennedy was
among the very first to arrive at the camp. He
had been engaged as coach and trainer.

The newspapers had a great deal to say about
how the Federals had taken the heart out of the
once great machine Collier controlled. Few of
them seemed to think that Locke, the new manager,
could repair the damages in less than a year or two.
He would do well, they declared, if he could keep
the club well up in the second division. For it
was said that Lefty himself would pitch no more,
and the rest of his staff, filled out with new men
and youngsters, must necessarily be weak and
298
wabbly. Occasionally a new deaf-mute pitcher,
Jones, was mentioned as showing great speed, but
who had ever heard of Jones? Of course he would
lack the experience and steadiness a pitcher must
possess to make good in fast company.

Behind the bat the Stockings seemed all right,
for Brick King would be there. Still, it was
strange that Frazer had let King go. Old Ben
was wise as the serpent, and he certainly had his
reasons. The Stockings were trying out a young
fellow named Sheridan in center field, but surely
Herman Brock was worth a dozen ordinary youngsters.
Some of the papers had a habit of speaking
of all youngsters as &#8220;ordinary.&#8221;

Jack Keeper, who seemed slated to hold down
the far cushion for the Stockings, was also a
youngster Frazer had not seen fit to retain. In
the few games he had played with the Wolves
Keeper had made a good showing, but the general
impression was that the manager had not considered
him quite up to Big League caliber. Various
other youngsters who had been farmed out to the
minors were being used at second and short, and
two of them, Blount and Armstrong, from the Cotton
States League, seemed to be the most promising.
But what an infield it would be, with three-fourths
of the players &#8220;unripened&#8221;! The interest
of the fans who read this sort of &#8220;dope&#8221; turned
299
to the Wolves, who were almost universally picked
as probable pennant winners.

All this was natural enough. The Wolves had
held together before the Federal raids better than
any team in the league. Certainly no one who
knew much about baseball would have chosen the
Blue Stockings in advance for a come-back. But
in baseball, and nearly everything else, there is no
fixed rule of reckoning that can&#8217;t be smashed.
Plenty of old-timers will say this is not so, just
as men assert that there is nothing like luck in the
game. The Stockings continued to attract little
attention during their tour North, although they
won exhibition games regularly and with ease.
Jones pitched in some of these games. Locke did
not.

All the same, no day passed that Lefty failed
to get out and warm up with his pitchers. Dillon,
Reilley, Lumley, and Savage were the old flingers
left with the staff. The &#8220;Glass Arm Brigade,&#8221; it
was called. Savage was regarded as the only one
of the quartet who possessed the stamina to work
through nine hard innings. Counting him out, the
team would have to depend on young twirlers. Of
course, Locke warmed up merely from habit and
as an example for the others. Otherwise he would
try to pitch sometimes in a game.

The season opened with the Blue Stockings playing
300
against the Dodgers, away from home. Mysterious
Jones pitched and shut the Dodgers out,
his team making five runs behind him. Even that
created no more than a slight flurry, for the
Dodgers were chronic subcellar champions. Jones
had speed, and it had dazzled them. But wait until
he went up against real batters!

Reilley and Lumley, taking turns on the mound,
succeeded in handing the Dodgers the second game
by a one-sided score. Savage went in and captured
the third contest, but Pink Dillon dropped
the fourth after making a fight for it up to the
eighth inning. If that was the best the Blue Stockings
could get, an even break, when facing the
habitual tailenders, what would happen to them
when they tackled the Wolves in the series to
follow?

The crowd turned out loyally to witness the
opening game on the home grounds, but even the
most hopeful among the fans permitted their courage
to be tinged with pessimism. They were in
that state of mind that would lead their sympathies
easily to turn to the opposition. True, they hailed
Lefty cheerfully and encouragingly from the
stands and bleachers, but they could not have the
faith in him as a manager that they had had as a
pitcher. They were stirred, however, by the sight
of old Jack Kennedy, and they gave him a rousing
301
cheer. It warmed the cockles of the veteran&#8217;s
heart. He doffed his cap to them.

Frazer came over from the visitors&#8217; bench and
shook hands with Locke and Kennedy.

&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;that you&#8217;re going to give
us a crack at that dummy speed merchant to-day,
Lefty. We want to see if he is a real pitcher.&#8221;

Coming forth from the home team&#8217;s dugout, a
swarthy small man, who wore knickerbockers and
a wrist watch, overheard these words.

&#8220;Bo-lieve me, Frazy,&#8221; said Cap&#8217;n Wiley,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll never ask for him again with any great
avidity after you face him once. I hope you&#8217;ll excuse
me for butting in and making that statement
without the polite formality of an introduction to
you, but I am so impetuous! I&#8217;m the proud party
who sold Jonesy to Lefty. Shortly after that little
transaction I was unnecessarily worried lest he
should decide to abandon baseball, but he has just
informed me that, having succeeded in giving away
the last of an infinitesimal fortune of two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, he is now excruciatingly
happy and ready to follow pitching as a profession.&#8221;

Frazer looked the odd character over tolerantly.
&#8220;So you&#8217;re the party who bunkoed Lefty, are
you?&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re very much in evidence
before the game begins, but I fancy it&#8217;ll be
302
difficult to find you with a microscope when it&#8217;s
finished&#8211;if Locke has the nerve to pitch your
dummy wonder.&#8221;

&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll start him on the hill, at any rate,&#8221;
said the manager of the Blue Stockings.

Apparently Wiley started to cheer, but checked
himself abruptly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll conserve my vocal cords,&#8221;
he tittered. &#8220;I doubt not that my voice will be
frazzled to a husky whisper before the contest terminates.
Take a tip from me, Mr. Frazer, and
send your premier twirler on to the firing line.
Smoke Jordan&#8217;s the only pitcher you have who can
make the game interesting with Jones pastiming
for the Stockings.&#8221;

&#8220;Jordan has asked to pitch,&#8221; returned Ben,
&#8220;but I have half a dozen others who would do just
as well.&#8221;

Locke was passing in front of the section occupied
by the newspaper men when Stillman called
to him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see your wife here, nor Miss
Collier,&#8221; said the reporter. &#8220;I looked for both
to be on hand for the opening game on the home
grounds.&#8221;

&#8220;Unfortunately neither was able to get here,
although they planned to do so,&#8221; explained Lefty.
&#8220;You know they have been spending the past eight
weeks in Southern California with Virginia&#8217;s aunt,
who invited them to accompany her and would not
303
take no for an answer. They&#8217;ll be on hand to-morrow,
however.&#8221;

Stillman leaned toward the wire netting and
lowered his voice. &#8220;Has Collier ever caught on to
the fact that the sister with whom he had quarreled
furnished the capital to save him from going to
smash?&#8221; he questioned.

&#8220;Not yet. It&#8217;s still a mystery to him how I was
able to come forward at the psychological moment
with that loan.&#8221;

The newspaper man laughed softly. &#8220;He came
near passing away from heart failure that day.
He was shocked almost as much as Garrity, but in
a different way.&#8221; His manner changed to one of
concern. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to use Jones to-day,
aren&#8217;t you? Think you have any chance to win?&#8221;

&#8220;Unless I&#8217;ve made a mistake in estimating that
man,&#8221; replied Locke, &#8220;it won&#8217;t be his fault if we
lose. But it&#8217;ll be a test for the whole team as well
as Jones.&#8221;

It was truly a test. A pitcher who was merely
a &#8220;speed merchant&#8221; could not have lasted three innings
against the Wolves, who &#8220;ate speed.&#8221; It
was not long, however, before the anxious crowd,
and the visiting team as well, began to realize that
the mute twirler had something more than speed.
Now and then he mixed in a sharp-breaking curve,
and his hopper was something to wonder at, something
304
that made the batters mutter and growl as
they slashed at it fruitlessly. But, best of all, besides
coolness and judgment, he had that prime essential
of all pitchers, control. With never-failing
and almost monotonous regularity, he seemed
to put the sphere precisely where he tried to put it.

In Brick King, Jones had a valuable aid. King
knew his old associates; if any one of them had a
batting weakness, he was aware of it. And not
once during the game did Jones question a signal
given him by King. What Brick called for he
pitched, and put it just where it should be put.
With such rifle accuracy, the work of the man behind
the bat seemed easy, save for the fact that
occasionally Jones&#8217; smokers appeared almost to
lift the backstop off his feet. But King held them
as if his big mitt had been smeared with paste.

Smoke Jordan was also in fine fettle. It was a
pitcher&#8217;s battle, with the crowd watching and
gasping and waiting for &#8220;the break.&#8221; It must
not be imagined that the Wolves did not hit the
ball at all, but for a long time they could not seem
to hit it safely, and for four innings they could not
get a runner on. In the first of the fifth, however,
a cracking single and two errors permitted them to
score an unearned run.

&#8220;If I know what I&#8217;m talking about,&#8221; said Ben
Frazer, &#8220;we had no license to get that tally. Now,
305
Smoke, you&#8217;ve got to hold &#8217;em. If that dummy
don&#8217;t crack, I&#8217;ll acknowledge that he&#8217;s a real
pitcher.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll hold &#8217;em,&#8221; promised Jordan.

But he couldn&#8217;t keep his promise. In the sixth,
with one down, King beat out an infield hit, reaching
the initial sack safely by an eyelash. He stole
second on the catcher for whom he had been discarded,
to the disgust of Frazer. The crowd
seemed to forget that Jones was deaf and dumb,
for it entreated him to smash one out, and Cap&#8217;n
Wiley, from his place in a box, howled louder than
any ten others combined. Jones drove a long fly
into left, but the fielder was there, and King was
held at second.

Hyland followed. Jordan, a bit unsteady,
bored him in the ribs.

Then Keeper, another Wolf discard, came up
and singled to right field. Covering ground like a
hundred yards&#8217; sprinter, King registered from second
on that hit, tying the score up.

The crowd went wild. The Blue Stockings and
Mysterious Jones had the fans with them after
that. Constantly that great gathering rooted for
another run&#8211;just one more. Hyland perished on
third when Spider Grant popped weakly.

If possible, the Wolves were fiercer than ever.
In the first of the eighth they got Jones into a
306
hole again through another hit and errors which
peopled the corners, with not a man down. Then
Jones won a roaring ovation from the standing
multitude by striking out three men in succession.

The game was settled in the last of the ninth,
and again Jack Keeper figured in the play. He
had reached second, with one out, when Grant hit
into the diamond. The ball took an amazingly
high bound. The shortstop went for it, at the
same time seeing Keeper scudding for third, and
realizing that it would be impossible to get him at
that sack. The moment he got the ball, the shortstop
whipped it to first, catching Grant by a foot.

There was a shout of warning. Keeper had not
stopped at third. Over the sack at full speed he
had flashed, and on toward home. The first baseman
lined the sphere to the catcher, who had
leaped into position. Keeper hit the dirt, twisting
his body away from the catcher, who got the
ball and jabbed at him&#8211;a fraction of a second too
late.

Keeper had accomplished a feat that is the desire
of every base runner&#8217;s heart. He had scored
from second on an infield out. And that performance
gave the Blue Stockings the game.

While the crowd was still shouting its rejoicing,
Cap&#8217;n Wiley found Frazer shaking hands with
Lefty.

307&#8220;I demand an apology!&#8221; croaked Wiley, barely
able to speak.

&#8220;I apologize,&#8221; said Frazer. &#8220;Your dummy can
pitch! But a team with one real pitcher is
scarcely equipped to cut much figure in the race.
Who&#8217;ll you use to-morrow, Locke?&#8221;

&#8220;I am thinking of trying out another one of our
uncertainties,&#8221; answered the southpaw, with an
enigmatical smile.


308CHAPTER XXXVIITHE RETURN OF LEFTY

The work of patching up his team and whipping
it into shape had kept Lefty Locke
busy pretty nearly every minute of his
time while awake, since the beginning of the training
season. With that task before him, and knowing
how little attention he could spare for Janet,
he had raised no objections when she had asked
to accompany Mrs. Vanderpool and Virginia on
the California trip. While he was not foolish
enough to believe that the reconstructed team could
become a pennant contender that season, he did
have hopes of finishing in the first division, which,
under the circumstances, would be a triumph indeed.

He had found Janet&#8217;s letters interesting
enough, but his concentration on other matters had
prevented him from giving them much thought
once they were read through. She had told him
of the rumor that Bailey Weegman, having been
lucky in escaping prosecution for his part in the
conspiracy, had started some sort of mail-order
309
business and was said to be taking in money &#8220;hand
over fist.&#8221;

Far more interesting, however, although almost
as quickly forgotten, was the gossip about Virginia
and Franklin Parlmee. Having returned
from his hasty and fruitless voyage across the
pond, Parlmee had felt not only injured but outraged
by the treatment he had received. It was
impossible for Virginia honestly to deny that she
had been led to distrust him&#8211;and by Weegman!
That cut the deepest. She had kept him ignorant
of the fact that she had returned home, thus allowing
him to go rushing off to Europe in an attempt
to find her. That had been his sole purpose;
he had been in no way concerned with Garrity
in a scheme to wrest the control of the Blue
Stockings from Collier. It was true that, having
come into a limited inheritance, he had purchased
two or three small lots of the club&#8217;s stock. His
judgment had told him that the price to which it
had dropped made it a good investment. Garrity
had been anxious to get hold of that stock. He
had pursued Parlmee and endeavored to buy the
certificates at a price that would have permitted
the holder of them to realize a good profit. But
what Garrity had wanted so badly Parlmee had
considered still more valuable, and he had refused
to part with a single share.

310A sense of injury on one side and shame and
false pride on the other had prevented complete
reconciliation between Parlmee and Virginia. But
Janet wrote that Miss Collier was not happy, although
she made a brave pretense of being so.
Once or twice Janet had detected her alone, crying.

Lefty had practically forgotten about these
things until, on that second day of battle with the
Wolves, only a few minutes before the game was
to begin, he looked toward the club owner&#8217;s box,
occupied as he knew by Virginia and Janet, and
made the discovery that Franklin Parlmee was
likewise there. The southpaw stood still in his
tracks, and stared, smiling; for he saw that Parlmee
and Virginia were chatting and laughing,
while Janet watched them with an expression of
complete satisfaction and pleasure.

&#8220;Patched it up at last, thank goodness!&#8221; muttered
Locke. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll keep away until after
this game is over. Plenty of time to congratulate
them then.&#8221;

He had been warming up, as usual, but to-day it
was observed that he did so alone with Brick King.
Many of those who took note of this were led to
speculate. Jack Stillman saw it, and smiled
wisely to himself.

A crowd, bigger than that of the previous day,
had turned out. The Blue Stockings&#8217; unexpected
311
opening victory over the Wolves was the cause.
Perhaps that had been no more than a flash in the
pan, but the fans wanted to see for themselves.
Deep down in the hearts of most of them was
a sprouting hope that it presaged something
more.

Practice was over. The home team was spreading
out on the field and making ready. Scrappy
Betts, first man up for the visitors, was swinging
two bats, prepared to drop one of them and advance
to the plate. The announcer lifted his megaphone,
and, sitting forward on the edges of their
seats, the crowd strained their ears to catch the
names of the battery men. &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to pitch
for us?&#8221; was the question they had been asking.

Through the megaphone came the usual hoarse
bellow. For an instant it seemed to strike the
great gathering dumb. Then a wild yell of astonishment
and delight went up. Everywhere in the
stands and on the bleachers fans turned to their
neighbors and shouted:

&#8220;Locke! It&#8217;s Lefty! Good old Lefty! Yow!
Ye-ee!&#8221;

They rose as one person and roared at him in
a mighty chorus when he walked out to the mound.
If he believed in himself, if he had the courage to
go in there against Frazer&#8217;s hungry Wolves, they
believed in him.

312The umpire adjusted his wind pad. Betts
dropped one bat and came forward, pausing a
moment a few feet from the plate while Locke
sent two or three across to get the range. That
good left arm swung free and unrestrained, without
a single sign to indicate that there had ever
been anything the matter with it. Smiling, the
southpaw nodded to Betts as King pulled on the
wire cage.

&#8220;You can patch up crockery, Lefty, old man,&#8221;
said Scrappy as he stepped into the box, &#8220;but you
never can make it as good as new.&#8221; Then, having
tried to work the portsider to the limit, he finally
whaled out a safety. &#8220;I knew it!&#8221; he cried from
first. &#8220;Bluff won&#8217;t mend a busted wing, old boy!&#8221;

Whether or not Locke was nervous, he passed
the next man.

The cheering of the crowd died away. Disappointment
and apprehension brought silence, save
for the confident chattering of the Wolf coachers
and the attempted encouragement of the players
behind the southpaw. Hope began to sicken and
wilt.

Cool and unruffled, Brick King smiled. &#8220;An
accidental hit and a pass won&#8217;t count in the result
to-day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Show Kipper the ball in your
hand. He won&#8217;t see it again.&#8221;

Kipper whiffed three times without making as
313
much as a foul tip. The crowd began to wake up
again.

Herman Brock sauntered out. Frazer had
given him Bob Courtney&#8217;s position in the batting
order, the &#8220;clean-up&#8221; place. No man knew
Herman better than Lefty, and the efforts of the
German were quite as futile as those of Kipper.

The crowd was cheering again as Brock retired
disgustedly. Confidence had been restored suddenly.

&#8220;Oh, you Lefty!&#8221; was the cry. &#8220;You&#8217;re
there!&#8221;

Locke easily forced the following batter to pop
to the infield. He had settled into his stride. If
he could keep it up, the shouting throng knew he
had indeed &#8220;come back&#8221; as strong as ever. Already
they were telling one another what that
meant. With three first-string pitchers like Lefty
and Jones and Savage, the team would have a
fighting chance. The principal question was
whether the southpaw could &#8220;go the distance.&#8221;

Not only did Lefty make it, but as the game
progressed he seemed to take it more and more
easily. The desperate Wolves could not get at
him effectively. He certainly had everything he
had ever possessed; some claimed that he had
more. His arm showed no sign of weakening.
But he used his head quite as much as his arm.
314
With the support of a catcher who also had brains,
and who worked with him perfectly, he made the
snarling, snapping Wolves appear about as dangerous
as tame rabbits. Before the ninth inning
was reached he knew that in Brick King he had
found the one catcher with whom he could do the
best work of his career.

The Blue Stockings won by a score of two to
nothing. What fortune the season brought them
in their fight for the pennant is told in the following
volume of the Big League Series, which is entitled,
&#8220;Guarding the Keystone Sack.&#8221;

The moment it was over Locke made a dash for
the clubhouse, getting away from the furiously
rejoicing fans who came pouring down upon the
field. Jones was there ahead of him. As he
panted in, Lefty saw the man of mystery standing
in a peculiar attitude not far from the closed door
of Charles Collier&#8217;s office. He seemed to be listening.
Involuntarily the southpaw paused and
listened himself.

From beyond the door came the sound of voices.
He heard a man speaking, and then, suddenly, another
man who appeared to be both excited and
distressed. Then he saw Jones spring like a
panther toward that door and hurl it open. Astonished,
Lefty quickly followed Jones into the
office.

315They burst in upon four persons. Two of them,
who looked like plain-clothes officers, seemed to
have a third in charge. This man was desperately
and wildly appealing to Charles Collier. It was
Bailey Weegman.

&#8220;It&#8217;s an outrage, I tell you!&#8221; Weegman was
crying. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lie! I haven&#8217;t used the mails to
defraud. I learned an hour ago that officers were
after me on that charge, and I hurried to you, Mr.
Collier. They followed me here. You must help
me! I served you&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;You served me a crooked turn,&#8221; interrupted
Collier coldly. &#8220;You have your nerve to come to
me!&#8221;

Locke&#8217;s eyes were on Jones. The man&#8217;s face
was aflame with triumph and joy and fathomless
satisfaction. He flung out his hand, his finger
pointing like a pistol at Weegman.

&#8220;Hanson Gilmore!&#8221; he cried in a terrible voice.

The mute had spoken! Frozen with amazement,
Lefty saw Weegman twist round, saw a light
of terror come into his eyes, saw him cower and
cringe, pale as death and shaking like an aspen.

&#8220;You swore away my liberty, you dog!&#8221; the
voice of Jones rang through the room. &#8220;You
were the scoundrel who conceived the Central
Yucatan Rubber Company, and profited by it!
When the prison doors closed upon me I swore I&#8217;d
316
never speak again until every dollar you had taken
from the victims of that concern was paid back&#8211;until
you were brought to book for your crime.
I&#8217;ve kept that vow. I&#8217;ve searched for you, determined
to bring you to justice somehow. Now
you have brought justice upon yourself.&#8221;

Crouching like a creature stung by the pitiless
lashing of a whip, the accused wretch appealed
chokingly to the officers who had arrested him:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him touch me! Look at his eyes!
He&#8217;s mad! Keep him off! Take me away!&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, take him away,&#8221; said Jones. &#8220;And if he
doesn&#8217;t get a prison sentence for this last piece of
work, I&#8217;ll keep after him until he&#8217;s punished for
his other crimes.&#8221;

&#8220;Take him away!&#8221; said Charles Collier, with a
wave of his hand.

Tottering weakly, the rascal who had met retribution
at last was led out.

The rejoicing players were stripping for their
showers. Locke and Jones appeared among them.

&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said Lefty, &#8220;let me introduce Martin
Bowman, whom you have hitherto known as Jones.
For reasons of his own, he made a vow never to
speak until a certain thing should happen. Happily,
events now make it possible for him to talk.&#8221;

&#8220;For which I am very thankful,&#8221; said Martin
Bowman quietly.

317They stared at him in limitless astonishment.
At last Spider Grant said:

&#8220;Well, this game to-day was enough to make a
deaf-and-dumb man talk!&#8221;

Eph, the colored rubber, touched Locke on the
arm.

&#8220;Yo&#8217; wife and a pahty o&#8217; frien&#8217;s am outside,
sah,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dey said as how dey&#8217;d wait fo&#8217;
you.&#8221;

&#8220;Tell them I&#8217;ll join them as soon as possible,&#8221;
directed Lefty.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
