INTRODUCTION


I know of no expounder of Holy Scripture on this side of
the Atlantic in the same class as Mr. Gaebelein. His work
on the Old Testament prophets especially is unique. To
understand and expound them not for scholars but for the
people, calls for a combination of gifts bestowed upon very
few.

Such a teacher must believe in the inerrancy of the autographs
of Scripture. He must interpret it literally except
where it clearly indicates to the contrary. He must apprehend
the dispensational scope of its teaching. He must
know and rely upon the Holy Spirit as the revealer of the
truth whose record He has inspired. He must have a
working knowledge of the Hebrew text and be able to pass
intelligently on questions of Biblical Criticism. He must
be familiar with the writings of others who have preceded
him. He must be a platform man in constant communication
with the people whom he would instruct. He must
be no dreamer, but wide-awake to current events and capable
of looking upon and dealing with them in a practical way.
He must use simple terms and express himself in plain
speech.

Mr. Gaebelein meets all these demands, for which we
who reap the benefits give God the praise.

Circumstances have prevented my reading all the chapters
of this present volume on Ezekiel, and hence I do not undertake
to endorse every detail of interpretation it contains,
but a general acquaintance with the author's point of view
as expressed in his volumes on Daniel, Joel, Zechariah,
Matthew and Revelation leads me to commend it strongly.

Pastors, evangelists, Bible teachers and Christians generally
who would be counted among the wise who understand,
need such helps as this as an antidote to the false
teaching flooding the church today, and to enable them to
stand up against the wiles of Satan on every hand. Familiarity
with the revelation of God in the Old Testament is simply
indispensable to the Christian witness in this twentieth
century, and to the soldiers of Christ in this crucial hour of
spiritual combat.

The Prophet Ezekiel.




INTRODUCTION.


From the opening verses of the Book, which bears the name
of the prophet Ezekiel, we learn that he was the son of Buzi
the priest, and belonged consequently to the much honored
Zadok family. That he knew the nobility of Jerusalem well
and was intimate with them may be indirectly learned from
the eleventh chapter. Rabbinical tradition identifies Buzi
(which means "contempt") with Jeremiah and makes him a
son of that prophet. There is, however, no positive evidence
for this. Eleven years before the complete ruin of
the city and the temple was effected by the King of Babylon,
Ezekiel was carried away into the captivity. This
deportation is recorded in 2 Kings xxiv:14. "And he carried
away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty
men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen
and smiths, none remained save the poorest sort of
the people of the land." Before Ezekiel with the princes
and the mighty men were taken into captivity, others had
been removed to Babylon, notably Daniel and his three
companions. This was in fulfillment of Isaiah xxxiv:6-7.
Ezekiel must have known Daniel personally. His name is
found three times in this book (chapters xiv:14, 20; xxviii:3).

Ezekiel was not a youth, as generally supposed, when he
was deported to Babylon, for the matured character of a
priest which appears in his writings and his full and intimate
acquaintance with the temple service, render such a supposition
highly improbable. Jewish tradition declares that
he exercised already the prophetic office before he was carried
away. The much disputed phrase "in the thirtieth year"
(chapter i:1) we hope to examine more closely in our exposition.[6]

The name Ezekiel means "strengthened by God." It has
been stated by some that this is not the original name of the
prophet, but his official title, which he adopted on account of
his ministry among the people. Very interesting on this
controverted point is the statement of a rabbinical comment.
The declaration is made that the prophets of God
received their significant names, so closely linked with and
expressive of the character of their messages, from above and
not according to the will of their earthly parents. God
called them to their work and had them named accordingly
before they ever entered upon their offices as prophets. We
believe this may be correct, especially in view of Jeremiah i:5.

The place where we find Ezekiel is the river Chebar.
This river is now known by the name Kabour. It emptied
into the Euphrates north of Babylon and was also called
Nar-Kabari, the great canal. Here Nebuchadnezzar had
started a colony of captives. In chapter iii:15, the name
of the place is given, it was at Tel-abib. In this settlement
the prophet seems to have lived. Two passages in the book
tell us that he had his own house (iii:24; viii:1). We also
know that he was married (xxiv:16-18). The death of
his wife is the only event he mentions of his personal history
and that would probably have not been recorded if it were
not connected with his prophetic office. The prophecies
he uttered among the captives are carefully dated. The
first date is found in chapter i:1-2. He began his prophetic
office on the fifth day of the fourth month (Tammuz) in the
fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity. The latest date
is recorded in chapter xxix:17. Here we have the twenty-seventh
year, so that the prophecies of Ezekiel cover a
period of about twenty-two years.

Ezekiel's great prophetic ministry is closely connected
with that of Jeremiah. When Ezekiel had his first great
vision on the banks of the river Chebar, Jeremiah had[7]
already been a prophet for thirty-five years. Only a few
years more remained for this great man of God. That
Ezekiel must have been acquainted with Jeremiah and his
messages of warning and exhortation is more than likely.
Yet it is strange there is not a single reference to Jeremiah in
the entire book of Ezekiel. It is strange in view of the fact
that the messages of these two men have so much in common.
Critics make the assertion that Ezekiel as a prophet
was moulded by the teaching of Jeremiah. Kuenen claims
that Ezekiel must have been for many years the close student
of Jeremiah's writings. Before Ezekiel proceeded to write
his own prophecies, his mind, it is claimed, had become so
saturated with the ideas and language of Jeremiah that every
part of his book betrays the influence of his predecessor.
This view would make Ezekiel an enthusiastic admirer and
copyist of Jeremiah. But in the book of Ezekiel the phrases
"Thus saith the Lord God"&mdash;"The Word of the Lord came
unto me"&mdash;occur over and over again. The words he
spoke, the mighty messages he delivered, were not produced
by the influence of Jeremiah nor by his example, but by the
Spirit of God. Other critics have even done greater dishonor
to this chosen instrument of the Lord and to the Word
he preached. We quote from The New Century Bible:
"It would appear that there runs through all the prophet's
activities, at least in the earlier period, a strain of mental
abnormality&mdash;perhaps of actual malady. By some writers
this has been supposed to be a form of catalepsy. Probably
Ezekiel was no more a cataleptic than Paul; with equal
probability he was what would now be called a 'psychical
subject,' and as such liable to trances&mdash;and perhaps a
clairvoyant." Such are the ridiculous things invented by
men, who claim scholarship, and whose aim is to deny the
supernatural origin of the words and the visions of the
prophets of God.

[8]
The fact is that Jeremiah and Ezekiel were called by
Jehovah to specific ministries. In their character and
natural temperament they differed greatly. Jeremiah
assuming, as a very young man, his prophetic office during the
reign of Josiah, was called to deliver the messages of the
awful judgments which were to come upon Jerusalem and he
had to witness these in their execution. He was an extremely
kind, gentle and tender-hearted man. Jeremiah is the
prophet of a dying nation; the agony of Judah's prolonged
death struggle is reproduced with ten-fold intensity in the
inward conflict which rends the heart of the prophet. Ezekiel
was of a different temperament. The deep soul exercise
we find so often in Jeremiah, his tender, loving sympathies
are almost entirely absent in Ezekiel. He lacked the
emotional character of Jeremiah. He was a man of great
energy and vigor; he was stern and had a deep sense of his
human responsibility. Both prophets uncover the corrupt
conditions of Judah and condemn them. The condemnations
in Ezekiel are far more severe than those of Jeremiah.
The style of Ezekiel is also different from that employed by
his contemporary.

"The whole of his writings show how admirably he was
fitted, as well by natural disposition as by spiritual endowment,
to oppose the 'rebellious house,' the 'people of stubborn
front and hard heart,' to whom he was sent. The
figurative representations which abound throughout his
writings, whether drawn out into lengthened allegory, or
expressing matters of fact by means of symbols, or clothing
truths in the garb of enigma, all testify by their definiteness
the vigor of his conceptions. Things seen in vision are
described with all the minuteness of detail and sharpness
of outline which belong to real existence. But this characteristic
is shown most remarkably in the entire subordination[9]
of his whole life to the great work to which he was
called."
[1]

In all this he differs from Jeremiah; and more so in the
greater and more complete visions concerning the future.

There is an evident connection between the communication
which Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem unto the captives
in Babylon and the beginning of Ezekiel's ministry. The
letter of Jeremiah is found in chapter xxix of the Book of
Jeremiah. It is an interesting document. It seems to have
been occasioned by a number of false prophets who had
appeared among the captives, and who encouraged the
rebellious and disobedient spirit which prevailed among
the exiles. They prophesied falsely, led the people away
and awakened the delusive hope of an early return from the
captivity. While Jeremiah continued to minister to the
feeble few and the poor, who were left behind, Ezekiel was
engaged among the captives and contended against these
false prophets and against the false hopes of the people who
gave no evidences of repentance. Inasmuch as Jerusalem
had not yet been completely destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar,
the captives, who had listened to the false prophets, expected
a speedy return to their own land. To dispel this false hope
Jeremiah had sent them the message, "For thus saith the
Lord, that after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon
I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in
causing you to return to this place" (Jere. xxix:10).
Ezekiel then labored also to dispel this false hope preached
by the prophets, whom the Lord had not sent. By his
stern and solemn words, by divinely commanded actions
and symbols, he had to deliver the message that there was
no hope for Jerusalem. When the catastrophe came at last
his ministry changed. He comforts the disappointed and[10]
heartbroken people and delivers his great restoration
messages.

This great prophet had to do certain divinely commanded
things in the presence of the people who were living in
deception after having listened to the false prophets.

In chapter iii:24-26 he had to shut himself up, bind himself
and then he was made dumb.

Then he was commanded to lie upon his right side and
upon his left for 430 days (chapter iv:4-8).

In chapter iv:9 he had to eat unclean bread. Then he
had to shave his head and beard (chapter v:1); to carry
a captive's baggage (chapter xxii:3-7); when his wife died he
was not to mourn (chapter xxiv:15-20); and again he lost
his speech (chapter xxiv:27). The key to all this is found in
chapter xxiv:24.

The visions of glory Ezekiel had belong to some of the
greatest recorded in the Word of God. Much in the beginning
of the book reminds of the last book of the Bible, the
Revelation. We mention a few passages to be compared:
Ezekiel i with Rev. iv and v. Ezekiel iii:3 with Rev. x:10.
Ezekiel viii:3 with Rev. xiii:14, 15. Ezekiel ix with Rev.
vii. Ezekiel x with Rev. viii:1-5. The critics declare upon
this striking correspondency that "much of the imagery of
Revelation is borrowed from Ezekiel."



[11]

THE ANALYSIS OF THE BOOK.


A careful reading of the Book of Ezekiel shows, in the
first place, that the Prophet received messages and saw
visions before the final destruction of Jerusalem, and after
that catastrophe had taken place in fulfillment of his inspired
predictions he received other prophecies. The predictions
preceding the fall of Jerusalem are the predictions of the
judgment to fall upon the city and upon Gentile nations,
the enemies of Israel. The predictions Ezekiel received
after the city had been destroyed are the predictions of
blessing and glory for Israel and Jerusalem in the future.
The first part of the book has found a fulfillment in the
destruction of the city by Nebuchadnezzar. The second
part is awaiting its fulfillment at the close of the times of the
Gentiles, when Israel will be regathered, restored and the
glory of the Lord returns to another temple, which Ezekiel
beheld in a magnificent vision. All will be accomplished
when the Lord returns to dwell in the midst of His people,
so that the name of the city will be "Jehovah-Shammah"&mdash;"the
Lord is there" (chapter xlviii:35). These two main
divisions are clearly marked in the book itself. In chapter
xxxiii:21, after the Prophet had received a renewed call as
watchman. We read: "And it came to pass in the twelfth
year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day
of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem
came unto me, saying, The city is smitten." This determines
the two parts.

Part I. Predictions before the Destruction of Jerusalem.
(Chapters i-xxxii.)

Part II. Predictions after the Destruction of Jerusalem.
(Chapters xxxiii-xlviii).

I. PREDICTIONS BEFORE THE FALL OF JERUSALEM

Chapter I-xxxii.


THE VISION OF THE GLORY OF JEHOVAH AND
THE CALL OF THE PROPHET.
Chapter I-iii:14.


I. The Introduction.

Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month,
in the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river
Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
In the fifth of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's
captivity, The word of the Lord came expressly unto
Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans
by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.

The book of Ezekiel starts with the description of a great
vision, which the prophet had among the captives of the
river Chebar. The first word "now," which really means
"and," connects the book with Jeremiah, as Joshua is
connected in the same way with Deuteronomy. The two
statements "I was" and "I saw" in the first verse make it
clear that Ezekiel is the author of this book. The third
verse has been marked by the critics as an addition by some
person, who edited the book later. There is no evidence
for that. In describing his own person and descent, he no
longer uses the personal pronoun. When he describes the
vision itself, giving his experience, he resumes the "I"&mdash;"I looked."
The "thirtieth year" has often been taken as
the age of Ezekiel and upon this a parallel has been drawn
between Ezekiel and our Lord. As Ezekiel was thirty
years old and saw heaven open at the banks of a river, so,
it is taught, the Lord Jesus was thirty years of age, when He[16]
saw heaven open at His baptism in Jordan (Matt. iii:16;
Luke iii:21). There is nothing in the text to warrant this
application. The thirtieth year must be reckoned according
to the Babylonian era, beginning with Nabopolassar, father
of Nebuchadnezzar, who became King of Babylon 625 b. c.
This was the date when Hilkiah found the book of the
law in the eighteenth year of King Josiah. This was the
thirtieth year before the fifth year of the captivity.

Four things are mentioned by Ezekiel in the introduction
of his book. 1. The Heavens were opened. 2. He saw
visions of God. 3. The Word of the Lord came upon him.
4. The hand of the Lord was upon him. The opened
heavens are not mentioned elsewhere in the Old Testament.
Ezekiel, the priest, is the only prophet of whom it is said that
he saw the heavens opened. Four times this phrase is found
in the New Testament. In Matthew iii:16 heaven was
opened at the Baptism of our Lord. In John i:51 the Lord
speaks of the heavens opened and the manifestation of
angels, which is still future and refers to His Coming in
power and glory. In Revelations iv:1 a door was opened
in heaven and John heard the words "Come up hither";
it is symbolical of the time, when the true church is taken
into the presence of the Lord. The last time opened heavens
are mentioned is in Revelations xix:11. It will be when our
Lord comes as King of kings and Lord of lords.

The opened heavens brought for Ezekiel visions of God
and the Word of the Jehovah. Not visions of Jehovah and
the Word of God. He saw the visions of God in His governmental
dealings with Israel, but the commission to him is
the commission of Jehovah, the name which denotes the
closer covenant relationship with His people. The vision
of opened heavens in the New Testament sense was not
given to Ezekiel. New Testament believers behold heaven
opened and have a vision. In the language of the Scriptures,[17]
"We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the
angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and
honor, that He by the grace of God should taste death of
every man" (Heb. ii:9). Our vision in the opened heavens
is the glorified Son of Man, in whom we are saved and seated
in the Heavenlies, in Whom we are accepted and Whose
glory we shall share. And when the Word of Jehovah came
to him, calling the priest to the prophetic office, the hand
of the Lord came also upon him. Opened heavens, visions,
direct call and enablement by the power of God. Such is
still the order for God's servants. And after the great
vision is passed, the seer is upon his face (verse 28). Then
Jehovah lifts him up and the Spirit entered into him (ii:2).

The phrase "the hand of the Lord was upon him" or
"came upon me" is found exactly seven times in the Book
of Ezekiel i:3; iii:14 and 22; viii:1; xxxiii:22; xxxvii:1 and
xl:1.


II. The Vision of Glory.

And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,
a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about
it, and out of the midst thereof as the look of glowing brass out
of the midst of the fire. Also out of the midst thereof came the
likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance;
they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces, and
every one had four wings. And their feet were straight feet;
and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they
sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. And they had the hands
of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had
their faces and their wings. Their wings were joined one to
another; they turned not when they went; they went every one
straight forward. As for the likeness of their faces, they four had
the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and
they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had
the face of an eagle. And their faces and their wings were parted
above; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two
covered their bodies. And they went every one straight forward:[18]
whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they
went. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance
was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: it
went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was
bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. And the living
creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.

And I looked at the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the
earth by the living creatures, toward their four faces. The appearance
of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a
chrysolite: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance
and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
When they went, they went upon their four sides: they turned
not when they went. As for their rims, they were high and
dreadful; and their rims were full of eyes round about them four.
And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them:
and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the
wheels were lifted up. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they
went, thither would their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted
up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the
wheels. When those went, these went; and when those stood,
these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the
wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living
creature was in the wheels. And there was the likeness of an
expanse upon the heads of the living creature as the colour of the
terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. And
under the expanse their wings straight, the one toward the other:
every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one
had two, which covered on that side their bodies. And when they
went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters,
as the voice of the Almighty, a tumultous voice, as the noise of an
host: when they stood, they let down their wings. And there was
a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they
stood, they let down their wings.

And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness
of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon
the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a
man above upon it. And I saw as the look of glowing brass, as the
appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance
of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins
even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had
brightness round about. As the appearance of the bow that is[19]
in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the
brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness
of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my
face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.

Ezekiel describes the vision of God which he saw. It is
one of the greatest visions of the Bible. To explain all in this
vision is beyond any expositor. Much has been written on
it which is extremely fanciful and ridiculous. The vision is
mentioned repeatedly in the book. In the tenth chapter we
meet it again. In chapter xi:22-23 the prophet beholds the
cherubim and the wheels and the glory of the Lord God
above them. The glory of Jehovah is seen departing from
Jerusalem by way of the mountain which is on the east side
of the city (the Mount of Olives). The last time this
great vision is mentioned is in chapter xliii. "And behold,
the Glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the East;
and His voice was like the voice of many waters; and the
earth was lit up with His glory. And the appearance of
the vision that I saw was according to the vision that I
had seen when I came to destroy the city; and the visions
were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar, and
I fell upon my face" (verses 2-4). We learn therefore that
the vision Ezekiel had was the vision of the glory of Jehovah.
This much is clear. The first chapter confirms this, for at the
end of the vision the statement is made: "This was the
appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah" (i:28).
That it meant judgment upon the unfaithful city is learned
from the tenth chapter, where one is commanded to take coals
of fire from between the cherubim and to scatter them over
the city (compare this with Rev. viii:5). Then the Glory of
Jehovah, Ezekiel had seen, departed from the city. It left
Jerusalem and the land by the East (chapter xi:22-23).
Ultimately that glory will return and cover the land once
more (chapter xliii:2-4).[20]

The vision was seen coming from the North. This is
generally applied to mean the threatened judgment against
Judea from Babylon. A storm cloud of divine indignation
was about to burst on Judea out of the North, that is,
from Babylon. However, another meaning is more than
likely, inasmuch as Babylon was not directly north of
Jerusalem. In Psalm lxxv:6 we read: "For promotion
cometh neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from
the South." It is from the North, that is from above,
that promotion, or help comes. In Isaiah xiv:13 the North
is also given as the place of the throne of God. From out
of the opened heavens from above, this great vision was
sweeping before the eyes of the priest-prophet. The whirlwind,
the cloud and the fire Ezekiel beholds first of all are
symbols of the divine glory and often mentioned in connection
with His manifestation. The Lord repeatedly
appeared in a cloud. He led His people by a pillar of cloud
and of fire. Sinai was enveloped in a thick cloud and
Jehovah descended upon it in fire. David in describing a
theophany mentions the wind, clouds and fire (Ps. xviii:8-13).
Read also Habakkuk's great vision (Hab. iii). The whirlwind
symbolizes Jehovah's indignation. Jeremiah had
announced the coming judgment under the figure of the
wind (Jere. iv:12-13). All Ezekiel saw as he looked up
indicated the presence of the God of Israel and His glory,
ready to deal in judgment with His unfaithful people.

Then the vision unfolds itself. First the living creatures
are seen. The tenth chapter calls them by the name of
cherubim. They are the same beings as described in Revelation
iv:6-9. The cherubim are not symbolical figures but
real beings, for they are called "living creatures." They are
not angels but belong to another class. Four cherubim
Ezekiel beheld with faces of the lion, the ox, the eagle and
the face of man. Their position is beneath the Throne.[21]
But while they had these four faces (representing God's
creation) they had the likeness of a man.

The likeness of a man as mentioned in Ezekiel's vision
is significant. First, the cherubim had "the likeness of a
man" (verse 5). Then the hands of a man were seen under
their wings (verse 8). When Ezekiel beheld the throne
itself, the throne of God, he saw upon the throne "the
likeness as the appearance of a man." And this man
upon the throne was enshrouded in glory, with the rainbow
about him. "And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance
of fire round about within it, from the appearance of
his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins
even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and
it had brightness round about. As the appearance of the
bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance
of the brightness round about" (verse 27-28). That
all this anticipates the Lord Jesus Christ, and His exaltation
upon the throne, government and judgment being given
into His hands, who is the glorified Man, cannot be questioned.
The application of the faces of the cherubim to
the fourfold character of our Lord as King, Servant, Man and
Son of God is well known. However, judgment in the
government of God is in Ezekiel's vision the leading reason
of the prominence of these celestial beings. They occupy
the same position in the last book of the Bible, the book of
Revelation. When the Lamb opens the first four seals,
one of the cherubim speaks. These seals are judgments.
In Rev. xv:7 one of these living creatures hands to the
seven judgment angels the seven vials in which the wrath
of God is completed. "And one of the four living creatures
gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the
wrath of God, who liveth forever and ever." In this solemn
capacity they appear in Ezekiel's vision as the attendants
of Jehovah's chariot and Jehovah's throne, which Ezekiel[22]
beholds above the expanse above their heads. All indicates
that this is the right interpretation. For instance,
verse 13. There we read of coals of fire, as they appeared;
lamps, or as it ought to be rendered, flaming torches, and out
of the bright fire came forth lightning. These are all
symbols of judgment. "And the living creatures ran and
returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning" (verse 14).
It denotes the swiftness of the threatened judgment.

And then the wheels and their work, the wheels in which
there was the spirit of these beings, their rims (not rings)
full of eyes, the orderly movements of these wheels under
the direction of the spirit, is seen in this vision. Much has
been made of this. The most ridiculous interpretation
was made several years ago when some teacher declared
that Ezekiel had the vision of an&mdash;airship! The wheels
are the wheels of the chariot upon which rests the throne
of God. They are representing the purposes of God in His
inerrant governmental dealings with the earth. God
controls it all and His Spirit directs every movement.

"Intelligence, strength, stability, and swiftness in judgment,
and, withal, the movement of the whole course of
earthly events, depended on the throne. This living energy
animated the whole. The cherubic supporters of the
throne, full of eyes themselves, moved by it; the wheels
of God's government moved by the same spirit, and went
straight forward. All was subservient to the will and
purpose of Him who sat on the throne judging right. Majesty,
government and providence united to form the throne
of His glory. But all the instruments of His glory were
below the firmament; He whom they glorified was above.[2]"

That "the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain" is
mentioned in connection with the Throne itself and mentioned
[23]last in the vision has a blessed meaning. It reminds
us of Genesis ix:13-16. "I do set My bow in the cloud
and it shall be for a token of my covenant between Me and
the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud
over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud....
And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
that I may remember the everlasting covenant between
God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the
earth." The judgment by water was past, and upon
the dark storm-cloud, which had retreated, the beautiful
bow, the sign of God's mercy, appeared. God always
remembers mercy in His wrath. Israel's hour of judgment
had come, but the bow about the throne promised mercy
to His people according to "His everlasting covenant."
Judgment-vision and predictions of judgment stand first
in Ezekiel's prophecy; mercy, restoration and glory are
revealed after the storm-cloud has passed. Thus Ezekiel
beheld the Glory of Jehovah as He himself was commissioned
by the Word of Jehovah to make it known to the people.


Chapter ii-iii:14.

I. Ezekiel's Commission.

And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I
will speak unto thee. And the Spirit entered into me when he
spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that
spake unto me. And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to
the children of Israel, to rebellious nations which have rebelled
against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me,
unto this very day. For they are impudent and hard hearted.
I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith
The Lord Jehovah. And they, whether they will hear, or whether
they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know
that there hath been a prophet among them.

And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid
of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou
dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor[24]
be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear
or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious. But
thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious
like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee
(chapter ii:1-8).

The great vision left Ezekiel prostrate upon his face.
He was affected by it in the same way as Daniel and others
were. Then the voice spoke. It was not one of the Cherubim
whose voice the Prophet heard. The Cherubim speak
in the book of Revelation; in Ezekiel they are silent. It was
Jehovah Himself, who in the vision appeared in the likeness
of a man, and addressed Ezekiel. Jehovah addressed him
as "Son of Man." This title is found exactly one hundred
times in the book. Only Daniel, besides Ezekiel, is called
by that name in the Old Testament (Dan. viii:17). Our
Lord called Himself by that title. Eighty-six times we find
Him using this title of Himself, as the rejected One. In
Suffering, in Exaltation, in Glory and in His Second Coming
He is the the Son of Man. Ezekiel passed through much
suffering. As we shall find in our exposition he had to bear
in his person symbolically what was to come upon the nation.
Suffering and shame was connected with it which he endured
and despised. He must have, therefore, been called by the
title "Son of Man," because he is a type of the rejected
Messiah, who took Israel's sin and shame upon Himself.

The voice commanded that the Prophet was to stand upon
his feet, and He, who spoke the word supplied the power to
do it. "And the Spirit entered into me when He spoke
unto me." Thus the Spirit and the Word are intimately
connected. After the Spirit had entered into him the
Prophet distinguished the words which Jehovah spoke,
"and I heard Him that spake unto me." Hearing and
knowing the Word is made possible by the Spirit.[25]

Then Ezekiel received his commission. A comparison
with Isaiah's and Jeremiah's commission shows them to be
like Ezekiel's. Isaiah had a great vision. He too saw the
Lord of Glory and the Seraphim, which differ from the Cherubim,
crying their three-fold "Holy." Then follows the
effect upon him, and the commission. "And He said, Go,
and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not;
and see ye indeed and perceive not. Make the heart of this
people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;
lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their
heart, and be converted and healed" (Isaiah vi:1-11). He
was chosen to pronounce hardening judgments upon the
nation. Jeremiah had no vision at all; but he also was chosen
to declare unto God's people their wicked ways and the
impending judgments (Jeremiah i). And so Ezekiel. He is sent
by Jehovah to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation.
The word used here in Hebrew for nation is the same, which
has been translated "heathen." It is "gojim"; indicating
that the children of Israel had sunken as low as the heathen,
who surrounded them. It is noteworthy that the word
"rebellious" and "rebelled" is found seven times. This had
become the leading characteristic of the favored people.
They had turned away from Jehovah and His Word, and now
the time had come when, ripe for judgment, God was to
deal with them. May we think here of that solemn warning
given to Christendom in Romans xi:21: "For if God spared
not the natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not
thee." God dealt with Israel on account of their unbelief
and rebellious spirit. And now Gentile Christians are plunging
into the same unbelief and apostasy; nominal Christendom
is rebellious. A greater judgment is therefore coming
upon Christendom than that which came upon the rebellious
people.

To this impudent and hard-hearted people Ezekiel was[26]
sent. The very first thing he was to say to them was that
great statement which appears hundreds of times in the Old
Testament scriptures, "Thus saith Jehovah God." The
sender is Jehovah-God; the commission and the message are
from Him. In the days of the darkest apostasy with judgment
about to come, the Lord told the prophet to face these
conditions and to stand in the midst of the rebellious nation
with a positive "Thus saith Jehovah God." He was His
mouthpiece. Such positiveness is demanded to-day. Oh!
for men who, like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, speak to-day the
Word, "Thus saith Jehovah God."

And Jehovah who calls and sends forth His servant gives
also assurance and encouragement. He told Ezekiel not
to be afraid of them or of their words. Even so the Lord
had encouraged Jeremiah (chapter i:7-8). Every servant
of the Lord can rest in this assurance that if he is faithful
and obedient the Lord will strengthen and keep him. "Speak
my words unto them;" not his own words, but Jehovah's
words. Thus he heard the same command, which is given
to the Lord's servants in the days when sound doctrine is
no longer endured: "Preach the Word" (2 Tim. iv:1-3).


II. The Roll Eaten and the Repeated Commission.

And when I looked, behold, an hand was put forth unto me;
and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; And he spread it before me;
and it was written within and without: and there was written therein
lamentations, and mourning, and woe.

And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat
this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. So I opened my
mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. And he said unto me,
Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill they bowels with this
roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth
as honey for sweetness.

And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of
Israel, and speak with my words unto them. For thou art not sent
to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the[27]
house of Israel; Not to any people of a strange speech and of an
hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely,
had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will
not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and
hardhearted. Behold, I have made thy face strong against their
faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. As an
adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them
not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious
house. Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that
I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine
ears. And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children
of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the
Lord God; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
Then the spirit took me up and I heard behind me a voice of a great
rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.
I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that
touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them,
and a noise of a great rushing. So the spirit lifted me up, and
took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit;
but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me (chapter ii:9;
iii:14).

He is commanded to open his mouth and to eat, after
the warning not to be rebellious. He then received a scroll
from a hand, no doubt, the hand he had seen in the vision.
It was written within and without with lamentations,
mourning and awe. He was commanded to eat and it was
like honey in his mouth. We are reminded at once of
Zechariah's flying scroll (Zech. v:1-4); of the scroll written
within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals, which
in John's vision the Lamb of God received to open the
seals (Rev. v and vi); and of the little book (or scroll) which
John received and ate, which was sweet in his mouth but
bitter in his belly (Rev. x:9-10). These scrolls have all one
meaning. They are symbolical of the Word itself, the
message of judgment and tribulation which are written
therein. All is symbolical and contains many spiritual[28]
and helpful lessons. The Word must be received; it must
be eaten. The prophet obeyed and ate. It was self-surrender
and therefore, though the message he was to bear
was a hard message, it was sweet to him. Jeremiah too
speaks of a similar experience. "When Thy words were
found, I did eat them; and Thy Word was to me the joy
and rejoicing of mine heart" (Jer. xv:16). No servant of
God can speak thus unless he receives the Word, feeds
on it himself, eats what the Lord has given and finds out the
sweetness of obedience and self-surrender. The Word to
be spoken, the message to be given, must come from Jehovah.
"I have put my words in thy mouth" was spoken to Jeremiah
(chapter i:9); and Ezekiel makes the same experience.
And our Lord, the true Son of Man, said that His meat and
drink was to do the will of His Father. He too fed on His
Word and was obedient to it.

In Ezekiel's experience there is a definition of divine inspiration.
The prophet received, accepted, took it in and
then gave it out. "Son of Man, go, get thee unto the house
of Israel, and speak with my words unto them." This is
inspiration. The Messages of God were given to the
prophets in the words of God. Such is the definition of
inspiration in the New Testament. "Which things also we
speak," saith the Apostle, "not in the words which man's
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth"
(1 Cor. ii:13). May all the Lord's people receive His Word,
eat His Word, speak forth His Word and find that it is indeed
sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.

Jehovah predicts failure for the message and the messenger.
The house of Israel will not hearken unto thee;
for they will not hearken unto Me. It was to make no difference
with the prophet. His commission was to speak
Jehovah's words, whether they heard or not. All this would
be branded by our own generation as extremely "pessimistic."[29]
That the message and the messenger should not be successful
is an unpalatable statement to well-meaning and enthusiastic
Christians. Yet this very fact is predicted for the last days.
"The time will come when they shall not endure sound
doctrine." Then the prophet was taken up by the Spirit.
Behind him a voice was heard, "Blessed be the Glory of
Jehovah from this place."

Cherubim and wheels are in motion. He is lifted up and
Jehovah's hand was strong upon him.


JUDGMENT ANNOUNCED. FOUR SIGNS AND TWO
MESSAGES.

Chapter iii:15-vii:27.

The next section of the Book of Ezekiel extends from
chapter iii:15 to the close of the seventh chapter. Here we
find that the Lord laid upon the Prophet the great responsibilities
as the watchman over the house of Israel and gave
him the message. Then the Prophet had to enact four
signs. The signs of the tile upon which he pictured Jerusalem
(iv:1-3); the sign of the Prophet's posture, laying 390 days
upon his left side and forty days on his right and prophesying
during this time against the doomed city (verses 4-8);
the sign of the food he was to eat, and its preparation; this
covers the same period of 390 days (verses 9-17); the last
sign was that of shaving the hair from head and face, and
dividing it into three parts. This fourth sign (chapter v)
is minutely explained and symbolizes like the other signs
the judgments against Jerusalem. Two solemn messages of
denunciations close this section, the first message predicts
the sword to fall upon the land and the people and their
subsequent dispersion (chapter vi). The second message
predicts the end which was to come upon the four corners of
the land. The great desolation is described in a marvellous[30]
way. The seventh chapter, which contains this second message
is one of the sublimest in the book. Both messages end
in the same way: "And they shall know that I am Jehovah."


Chapter iii:15-27.

I. The new charge and Ezekiel's new experience.

Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt
by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained
there astonished among them seven days. And it came to pass
at the end of seven days, that the word of the Lord came unto me,
saying, Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house
of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
warning from me. When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely
die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the
wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man
shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness,
nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou
hast delivered thy soul. Again, When a righteous man doth turn
from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block
before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him
warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath
done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine
hand. Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the
righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because
he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.

And the hand of the Lord was there upon me; and he said unto
me, Arise go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory
of the Lord stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of
Chebar: and I fell on my face. Then the spirit entered into me,
and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me,
Go, shut thyself within thine house. But thou, O son of man,
behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with
them, and thou shalt not go out among them: And I will make
thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt
be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a
rebellious house. But when I speak with thee, I will open thy
mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God;[31]
He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him
forbear: for they are a rebellious house (chapter iii: 15-27).

The Prophet had been transported from the place mentioned
in chapter i:1 to Tel-abib, which was also on the river
Chebar. Here a number of captives dwelt. For seven
days he sat in their presence astonished and did not open
his lips. Was it their sad condition, or the knowledge of
their rebellious spirit, or the threatening judgments which
produced this silence? Most likely these things filled the
Priest-Prophet with unspeakable sorrow and sadness, so
that he could not find words. And the captives must have
read the burden of his soul in his countenance. The scene
reminds us of Job and his three friends, who "sat down with
him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and
none spoke a word unto him, for they saw that his grief
was very great" (Job ii:13). Job broke the silence by cursing
his day. But the silence of Ezekiel's seven days was broken
by the Lord Himself. He addressed the Prophet and told
him that He had made him "a watchman unto the house of
Israel." His duty and responsibility in that capacity was
twofold; first to hear the Lord's Word from His own lips,
then to give the warning from Him. Warning is the important
call of a watchman (chapter xxxiii:2, 6, 7; Isaiah lii:8;
lvi:10; Jer. vi:17). If the appointed watchman does not
hear the Word as it comes from Jehovah, he cannot sound
the alarm. The false prophets in Israel, who did not warn
the people, but said, "Peace, peace!" when there was no
peace, followed their own dreams instead of the Word.
They did not believe the solemn messages God had given
through former prophets. That was the curse among
the professing people of God then. It produced a false
security, decline and apostasy; it hastened the impending
judgments of God. It is the curse to-day in the professing
church. His Word is rejected. The solemn truths concerning[32]
"judgment to come" upon an ungodly age and apostate
"church" are not heeded and mostly rejected. The
man who sounds the warning and stands by the declarations
of God's Word is as unpopular with the people to-day as
Jeremiah and Ezekiel were in their days.

The Prophet was commissioned not to warn the nation
as such, but to warn individuals. The wicked and the
righteous are mentioned and the Prophet's responsibility
in delivering the message. If he does not warn the wicked
to turn from his wicked way to save his life, his blood will
be required from his hands. If he is faithful and the wicked
does not hear the warning, the wicked shall die, but the
faithful messenger delivers his own soul. And so with
the righteous, who turns from his righteous acts and commits
iniquity. He is threatened with death; but if he sins
not and is warned he shall live. After hearing the warning
Word each is to bear the consequences of his own conduct.
The nation as such was rebellious. Its doom could
not be averted. Yet God in His long-suffering still gave
the individual an opportunity to escape the threatening
judgment, that by hearing the Word he might live. This
gracious offer concerned the wicked. The righteous one in
Israel, who obeyed the law and did acts of righteousness
had to continue in obedience; if he failed in the midst of the
great national crisis when judgment was about to fall,
his former righteous deeds could not save his life. He also
would be swept away and die in his sins. The first part of
the third chapter reveals the hardened condition of the
nation; there was no remedy. The second part reveals the
possibility of the deliverance of all who harkened to the
divine warning and turned from their evil ways.

The passage, as well as the corresponding one in chapter
xxxiii:1-20, has been often used in the defence of what is
termed "falling from Grace," that a true believer, who is[33]
saved by Grace, may by sinning become unsaved again and
then perish in his sins like the wicked. The words "fallen
from Grace" are found only once in the Bible, that is in
Gal. v:4. The context shows what they mean. If a believer
goes to the law to be justified before God, if he tries by his
own works, and by ordinances, to be righteous before God,
he abandons the ground of Grace. The dispensation in which
we live is the dispensation of Grace; Grace reigns through
righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
(Rom. v:21). The message delivered by God to Ezekiel
is in fullest keeping with the character of the law-covenant,
though Grace is also manifested in it. Righteousness has
not the meaning here as in the New Testament. We are
constituted righteous by faith in Jesus Christ. It is now not
the question of doing righteous deeds in order to be saved
and live. We are saved by Grace through faith. "Now to
him that worketh is the reward not reckoned as of grace
but as of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth
on Him, who justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for
righteousness" (Romans iv:4). And he who is justified
by faith has peace with God. The true believer may
sin, but he does not deliberately practice and live in sin, for
"he that is born of God doth not commit (practice) sin"
(1 John iii:9). If he falls in sin a gracious provision is made.
We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous, and therefore we can confess our sins; forgiveness
and cleansing follow according to the divine promise (1 John
i:9; ii:1-2).[3]

After this solemn charge the hand of the Lord rested upon
Ezekiel and he was commanded to go into the plain, where[34]
Jehovah would talk with him. He obeyed and beheld
again the Glory of the Lord, which he had seen by the river
of Chebar. Once more he fell on his face. Then the
Spirit entered into him and said unto him: "Go, shut thyself
within thy house." He had no opportunity to exercise
his office as watchman and deliver the warning message.
Immediately after the charge he was commanded to separate
himself from the captives and then became a prisoner in
his house. But more than that. They were to put bands
upon him and bind him with them.

Does this mean that the people would bind him so that he
could not leave the house? It probably meant the opposite.
He was to shut himself in the house and they came with bands
and bound him, to get him out of the house by force. But
he was not to go among them. Then God Himself made
the Prophet dumb. "And I will make thy tongue cleave
to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and
shalt not be to them a reprover, for they are a rebellious
house (verses 25-26). First he was to be bound so that he
could not go amongst them, and then God Himself would
make him dumb so that he could not reprove the people.
Different suggestions have been made about the meaning of
the condition in which the Prophet was put. Some have
even declared that there is a contradiction in all this, in
view of verses 16-21, while rationalistic expositors think
that the Prophet suffered from some nervous disorder which
deprived him temporarily of the power of speech. That
the Prophet was unfitted by God to go amongst the people
and deliver the message in public was a testimony against
the nation. They were beyond hope, therefore, on account
of their rebelliousness; he was not to be a reprover to them.
It witnessed to the fact that judgment upon the nation
could not now be arrested. And yet his dumbness was not
complete nor constant. The last verse of the chapter[35]
makes this clear. "But when I speak with thee, I will
open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith
the Lord God; he that heareth let him hear; and he that
forbeareth, let him forbear; for they are a rebellious house."
Thus the Prophet was completely cast upon Jehovah.
Jehovah directed him in being silent or in uttering His
message. Blessed are all servants of the Lord, who know
the same path of dependence and who declare the Word
of the Lord, "Thus saith the Lord," whenever they speak.

The Prophet's mouth was opened completely and his
power of speech permanently restored after Jerusalem had
fallen. "And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our
captivity, in the tenth day, in the fifth day of the month,
that all that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me,
saying, the city is smitten. Now the hand of the Lord
was upon me in the evening, before he that escaped came;
and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the
morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more
dumb" (chapter xxxiii:21-22). This had been previously
announced. "In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him
which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb;
and thou shalt be a sign unto them, and they shall know
that I am the Lord" (chapter xxiv:27). Thus Ezekiel's
dumbness was a sign to the nation; the sign of God's displeasure
and the coming judgment upon Jerusalem.


THE FOUR SYMBOLICAL SIGNS.

Chapters iv and v.

The divine predictions of the impending doom for Jerusalem
was not believed by the exiles. The messages of the
false prophets who moved among them encouraged the
rebellious spirit and therefore the threatened disaster was
thought incredible by the captives. The mission of Ezekiel
was to dispel the false hope of a speedy return to the land.[36]
After he had received his solemn commission and the message
he was to deliver to the rebellious people, he is commanded
to enact four signs, which were to teach the captives that
which would speedily come upon their beloved city Jerusalem.

I. The Sign of the Tile. The first symbolical sign is
that of the tile, which the Prophet was to use to picture
the coming siege of Jerusalem.

Thou also, son of man, take thee a brick, and lay it before thee,
and portray upon it the city, Jerusalem; And lay siege against it,
and build forts against it, and cast a mound against it; set the
camps also against it, and set battering-rams against it round about.
Moreover take thou unto thee an iron plate, and set it for a wall
of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face against it, and
it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This
shall be a sign to the house of Israel (verses 1-3).

The word translated "tile" means a brick. The Babylonians
used clay bricks to keep their records; whole libraries
consisting of a very large number of such bricks have been
uncovered by the spade of the excavator. These bricks
were almost square, fourteen by twelve inches. Many
have been found which have engraven upon them various
building plans and astrological figures. Such a brick
Ezekiel was commanded to take and draw upon the soft
clay surface a city, which was to represent Jerusalem. The
second verse shows Jerusalem in the state of siege. The
coming calamity was vividly pictured in this first sign.
The Prophet was also to take an iron pan (literally: plate)
and use it for a wall of iron between him and the city and set
his face against it. In all this the Prophet was to show
Jehovah's action against Jerusalem. He impersonated
Jehovah in laying siege against it in marking the clay brick
and raising the iron-plate between himself and the city.
In connection with the latter sign we may well think of
Isaiah lix:2: "Your iniquities have separated between you[37]
and your God." Thus in this first sign the certainty of the
successful siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans was set
forth in plain view of the captives. Yet they heard not
and continued their foolish dreams and believed rather the
false prophets. God has everywhere set forth in His Word
coming judgments. Our age, so self-secure and boasting
in many of its godless achievements, will end in a great
judgment-catastrophe. Every portion of God's Word testifies
of this fact. God will fulfil the prophecies of His
servants the prophets. The past fulfilment of God's threatened
judgments vouch for the literal fulfilment of those still
future. Yet our blinded age (2 Cor. iv:4) heeds it not.
More than ever they say, "Peace and safety," and ridicule
God's message and God's messengers, who give a faithful
warning.

II. The Sign of the Prophet's Physical Position. While
in the first sign Jehovah's action against Jerusalem was
pictured, in the next signs a portrayal is given of the punishments
which should come upon the people. The Prophet's
divinely commanded actions witnessed beforehand what
should come upon the disobedient, rebellious nation. In
his own person Ezekiel had to taste the great degradation
and judgment which was about to become the portion of
the people.

Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house
of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou
shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity. For I have laid upon
thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the
days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear them,
lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity
of the house of Israel. And when thou hast accomplished them,
lie again on the right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of
the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day
for a year. Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of
Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy[38]
against it. And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou
shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou hast ended
the days of thy siege (verses 4-8).

Expositors and critics have interpreted this and the
other signs in various ways. Higher Criticism maintains
that the whole description is purely ideal and that the
Prophet never did in person what was asked of him. They
point to the fact that nowhere is a statement made that he
did these things. We quote from the "Expositor's Bible":

"It is clear that these signs could never have been enacted,
either in view of the people or in solitude, as they are here
described. It may be doubted whether the whole description
is not purely ideal, representing a process which passed
through the prophet's mind, or was suggested to him in the
visionary state but never actually performed."

Other critics have tried to explain the Prophet's actions
by some kind of a catalepsy, from which, they claim, he
suffered. All these theories are pure inventions, springing
from a denial of inspiration. They make much of the
physical impossibility of this command to lie continuously
for 390 days on the left side and for 40 days on the right
side. But it does not say that the Prophet should be in
that position day and night during that allotted time. The
fact that he was to prepare food to eat during these days
excludes this extreme view. The Prophet no doubt carried
out the divine command as he understood it, and thereby
gave the people a sign concerning their iniquity and the
deserved punishment. But what do the 390 days of Israel
and 40 days of Judah mean? The text shows that the days
here mean years.[4] The 390 and 40 days make 430 days.[39]
This reminds us of Exodus xii:40-41, where the sojourning
of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt is given as
430 years. The 40 years of Judah recall the years of wandering
in the wilderness. The 390 days apply to the period
of Israel's unfaithfulness, which lead up to their punishment.
These 390 years must be reckoned from Jeroboam,
who was the first King of the house of Israel by divine
appointment as revealed through Ahijah, the Prophet
(1 Kings xi:31). The 40 years of Judah, for which Ezekiel
was to lie upon his right side for 40 days must mean the
40 years of Solomon's reign. Solomon went after Ashtoreth,
the vile goddess of the Zidonians. Judah worshipped besides
Ashtoreth, Chemosh, the god of the Moabites and Milcom,
the god of Ammon (1 Kings xi:33). Thus the captives
were reminded by the Prophet's painful position of the
shameful history of the long years of apostasy of their
nation. But more than that. The Lord said expressly
to Ezekiel: "I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity
... so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the
house of Israel." By consulting other passages in the Old
Testament, especially in Exodus and Leviticus,[5] it will be
found that the phrase "bear their iniquity" always means
to endure the punishment due to sin or iniquity. Ezekiel's
sign therefore pictured the actual results in punishment,
which was now to fall upon the people for their sins. The
390 years and the 40 years therefore must be primarily
applied to the period of their punishment. The Prophet,
therefore, had put upon him suffering typical of the nation's
punishment. He is in this a blessed type of the great Sinbearer,
who bore our sins in His own body on the tree. Of
Him it is written, "He shall bear their iniquities." And
the believing remnant of Israel in a future day, looking[40]
upon Him, whom they pierced, will yet confess "He was
wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our
iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him
and with His stripes we are healed" (Isaiah liii:5).

III. The Sign of the Famine and the Defiled Bread. The
siege of Jerusalem had been portrayed in the tile sign; the
hardships in divine judgments in the second and the third
sign describes additional punishments to come upon Jerusalem.

Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and
lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and
make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that
thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt
thou eat thereof. And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by
weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shall thou eat it.
Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin:
from time to time shalt thou drink. And thou shalt eat it as barley
cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man,
in their sight. And the Lord said, Even thus shall the children
of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I
will drive them (verses 9-13).

Then the Priest-Prophet, horrified at the defilement he
was to be subjected to, spoke to Jehovah and received an answer
from Him granting his request and giving further instructions
about the sign.

Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, my soul hath not been
polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of
that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there
abominable flesh into my mouth. Then he said unto me, Lo,
I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt
prepare thy bread therewith. Moreover he said unto me, Son
of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and
they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink
water by measure, and with astonishment: That they may want
bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume
away for their iniquity (verses 14-17).[41]

This sign then shows the horrors of the siege of Jerusalem
and what was to come upon the people during the period
of their punishment. The wheat, barley, beans, lentils,
millet and fitches[6] were to be put into one vessel, because
a little of each was available. To eat things by weight and
not to be satisfied with it, was announced through Moses
as one of the threatened judgments. "And when I have
broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your
bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread
again by weight; and ye shall eat and not be satisfied"
(Lev. xxvi:26). The sign meant famine as the Lord told
Ezekiel (verse 16).

Then uncleanness, defilement, is added. The famine
stands connected with the siege, the defilement refers more
to that, which was to come upon them in their captivity
among the Gentiles. It pictured the unclean religious
conditions into which the people were to be plunged during
the exile. "Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their
defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive
them." The same judgment was announced by Hosea.
"They shall not dwell in the Lord's land; but Ephraim shall
return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.
They shall not offer wine to the Lord, neither shall they be
pleasing unto Him; their sacrifices shall be unto them as
the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted"
(Hosea ix:3-4). And Ezekiel baked the bread in the prescribed
way, while no doubt, the captives looked on in horror,
that a Priest like Ezekiel could act thus. The sign found
its fulfillment. God's predicted judgments were always
literally fulfilled. God means what He has declared in His
Word. The future will yet witness to it.

[42]
IV. The Sign of the Shaving of the Head and the Face.

And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a
barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy
beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair. Thou
shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the
days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and
smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter
in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them. Thou shalt
also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.
Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire,
and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all
the house of Israel (chapter v:1-4).

In this final sign we have the symbol of what was to befall
the nation as such. Through the Prophet Isaiah a prediction
had been given concerning the King of Assyria, which
explains the meaning of the sharp knife. "In the same day
shalt the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by
them beyond the river, by the King of Assyria, the head,
and the hair of the feet, and it shall also consume the beard"
(Isa. vii:20). The sharp knife[7] represents in Ezekiel's sign
the King of Babylon. He was Jehovah's instrument executing
His wrath. The people are represented by the hairs.
The sharp knife, the sword of justice, was to cut them off.
The third part of the hair burned with fire pictured the fate
of a part of the people during the siege. Besides the fire,
the pestilence and the famine were to consume them (verse
12). Another part was to be destroyed by the sword round
about Jerusalem, while still another part should be scattered
unto all the winds, that is dispersed among the Gentiles,
where the sword would also follow the fugitives. Only a
few in number, a small remnant were to be preserved which
was symbolically enacted when Ezekiel took a few hairs and
bound them in his skirt. But even some of them should[43]
be put into the fire. Such a remnant, saved and preserved
and ultimately blessed, is often mentioned in the prophetic
Word. See Isaiah vi:13; x:22; Jere. xxiii:3; Ezek. vi:8;
Zech. xiii:8-9. All these judgments came upon the city
and upon the nation. A remnant also was saved and in
due time returned.

Thus saith the Lord God; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the
midst of the nations and countries that are round about her. And
she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the
nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round
about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes,
they have not walked in them. Therefore thus saith the Lord God,
Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about
you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my
judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the
nations that are round about you; Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments
in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations. And I will do in
thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any
more the like, because of all thine abominations. Therefore the
fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat
their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole
remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds. Wherefore, as
I live, saith the Lord God; Surely, because thou hast defiled
my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine
abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall
mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity. A third part of thee
shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed
in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword
round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds,
and I will draw out a sword after them. Thus shall mine anger
be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and
I will be comforted: and they shall know that I, the Lord, have
spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.
Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations
that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by. So it
shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment
unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute
judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes.[44]
I, the Lord, have spoken it. When I shall send upon them the evil
arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which
I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you,
and will break your staff of bread: So will I send upon you famine
and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and
blood shall pass through thee: and I will bring the sword upon thee.
I, the Lord, have spoken it (verses 5-17).

After these few signs had announced to the captives what
was to come upon the city and upon the people, Jehovah
begins to speak. The solemn words we have quoted need
but little comment. He speaks of Jerusalem's exalted
place, her wickedness, which had become greater than that
of the nations, her disobedience and her judgments. One
must read the Lamentations of Jeremiah to find how all was
fulfilled in the final overthrow of Jerusalem. Compare
verse 10 with Lament. iv:10. How terrible are the judgments
of a righteous and holy God! The calamity which fell
upon Jerusalem and the land through the hands of Nebuchadnezzar
was repeated on a more fearful scale in the year 70,
after the greater One than Ezekiel, the Lord Jesus Christ,
had given His solemn warnings and had wept over the city.
And once more will Jerusalem taste of wrath and judgment in
that end of the age, which is called the great tribulation.
And after that the day-break, when Jerusalem will rise out
of the dust and her history of shame and sorrow will be
ended.


THE TWO JUDGMENT MESSAGES.

Chapter vi-vii.

Two judgment messages follow. Each message is a
direct communication from Jehovah to the Prophet. "And
the Word of the Lord came unto me." Both messages end
in the same way: "And they shall know that I am the
Lord." In the first message the judgment of the whole
land is announced. The second message announces the[45]
completeness of the judgment. The predicted end is described
with its accompanying perplexities and sufferings.


I. The Coming Judgment against the Mountains and
the Land.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, set
they face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against
them, And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
God; Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills,
to the rivers, and to the valleys, Behold I, even I, will bring a sword
upon you, and I will destroy your high places; and your altars
shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken; and I will cast
down your slain men before your idols. And I will lay the dead
carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will
scatter your bones round about your altars. In all your dwelling-places
the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be
desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate,
and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be
cut down, and your works may be abolished. And the slain
shall fall in the midst of you; and ye shall know that I am the Lord
(chapter vi:1-7).

The denunciation against the mountains of Israel stands
in the first place. Jerusalem was mostly in view in the preceding
chapters, but now the Lord announces that the whole
land is to become desolate through His wrath. The mountains
of Israel's land were used as places for idolatry; they
are called "the high places." Images and shrines were
erected upon these heights where the vile and idolatrous
worship of heathen gods was practiced. These images were
idols dedicated to sun-worship. That Israel would become
idolatrous had been revealed to Moses, who also announced
the judgment which should ultimately fall upon Israel for
their idolatry. "And I will destroy your high places, and
cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the
carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. And
I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet[46]
odors. And I will bring the land into desolation, and your
enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished. And I
will scatter you among the nations and will draw out a
sword after you and your land shall be desolate, and your
cities waste" (Lev. xxvi:30-33). This remarkable prophetic
statement was made to Moses, who wrote it hundreds of
years before. And now the time for its fulfillment had at
last come. God in His patience had delayed the judgment,
but when the time had come He remembered all that Moses
heard from His lips and executed His own Word. A careful
comparison of the passage in Leviticus with verses 3-6
of this chapter shows the literal fulfillment.

Yet will I leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall
escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered
through the countries. And they that escape of you shall remember
me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives,
because I shall have broken their whorish heart, which hath departed
from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their
idols: and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they
have committed in all their abominations, and they shall know
that I am the Lord, and that I have not said in vain that I would
do this evil unto them. Thus saith the Lord God: Smite with thine
hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil
abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the
sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. He that is far off shall
die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword;
and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine;
thus will I accomplish my fury upon them. Then shall ye know
that I am the Lord, when their slain men shall be among their idols
round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the
mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak,
the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols. So
will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate;
yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all
their habitations: and they shall know that I am the Lord
(verses 8-14).

The Lord promised that in mercy He would leave a[47]
remnant. That remnant would acknowledge the evil
they had done. "They shall loathe themselves for the evils
which they have committed in all their abominations."
This is the result of Jehovah's action towards themselves.
The words "because I am broken with their whorish heart"
are literally translated "when I shall have broken their
whorish heart which has departed from me." No judgment
which came upon God's peculiar people ever made a complete
end of the nation. A remnant always remained and turned
to the Lord. During the greatest and longest judgment
which has ever befallen the people Israel, their world-wide
dispersion in the present age, there is also a remnant amongst
them (Romans xi:5). And when Jehovah resumes His
dealings with them during the last seven years of the Times
of the Gentiles, the time of their greatest trouble, a remnant
will turn to Him and be converted. That remnant will be
carried through the mighty judgments of the end time and
receive the blessings and the glory of the promised kingdom.

Ezekiel was also commanded to smite with his hand and
to stamp with his foot. Clapping the hands and stamping
with the feet may denote exultation (chapter xxv:6). But
here it is more an outward expression of the vehemence of
the judgment. In chapter xxi:7 we read of the Lord smiting
His hands. "I will also smite mine hands together, and I
will cause my fury to rest, I the Lord have said it." A
repetition of the impending judgments forms the conclusion
of this first message.


Chapter vii.

II. The second Judgment Message. The End is at Hand.
The Complete Judgment.

The seventh chapter which contains the second judgment
message, closes the first prophecy of Ezekiel. All the different
elements and phases of judgment which had just been[48]
foretold by the Prophet are now gathered up in this final
great utterance. As the chapter is written in a certain
rythm and contains in the authorized version many incorrect
renderings, we give a corrected metrical translation.
 "And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, And thou
Son of Man, thus saith Jehovah unto the land of Israel:


An end cometh! The end
Upon the four corners of the land.
Now cometh the end upon thee
And I will send mine anger upon thee,
And I will judge thee according to thy ways;
And I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
And mine eyes shall not spare thee,
Neither will I have pity;
Because I will bring thy ways upon thee
And thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee:
And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

Thus saith the Lord Jehovah!
An evil&mdash;an only evil!&mdash;behold it cometh.[8]
An end is come&mdash;the end is come!
It awaketh against thee. Behold it cometh!
O inhabitant of the land, thy doom is come unto thee
The set time is come, the day is near,
The day of tumult.
And not the joyous shouting upon the mountains;
Now will I soon pour out my fury upon thee
And accomplish mine anger against thee.
I will judge thee according to thy ways,
And will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity.
According to thy ways will I render unto thee,
And thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee,
And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, who smiteth
(chapter vii:1-9).


This is the first section of this great and solemn portion of
Ezekiel's prophecy. The end is announced to come upon the
[49]
entire land. The set time for judgment had come, it could
no longer be averted. How merciful had been Jehovah's
dealing with His beloved people. "But He, being full of
compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not;
yea many a time turned He His anger away, and did not
stir up all His wrath" (Ps. lxxviii:38). But now the measure
of their wickedness had come. The day of reckoning was at
hand. Divine fury was to sweep now over the entire land.
His eyes would no longer spare nor would He pity them any
longer.

There is another day coming in which the Lord will deal
in fearful judgments with this earth. Now is the day of
salvation in which God speaks in love through His Son.
When wickedness and apostasy has reached its climax, the
day of salvation will end and "the day of vengeance of our
God" will begin. Then He will speak in His wrath and vex
them in His sore displeasure (Ps. ii:5). Then will they say
to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from the
face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath
of the Lamb; for the great day of His wrath is come; and who
shall be able to stand?" (Rev. vi:16-17). God's judgments
for the future are as sure as were His judgments in the past.
There is a set time, the day of the Lord, when He, to whom
the Father has given all judgments, will tread "the winepress
of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty" (Rev.
xix:15).


Behold the Day! Behold it cometh!
Thy doom advanceth:
The rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.
Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness;
None of them shall remain; yea none of their multitude,
Nor their wealth; neither shall there be eminency among them.
The time is come, the day draweth near;
Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn,
For wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
[50]
For the seller shall not return to that which is sold,
Even though he were yet amongst the living.
In the vision touching the whole multitude thereof
It shall not be revoked;
And none shall through his iniquity assure his life.
They have blown the trumpet and made all ready,
But none goeth to the battle;
For my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
The sword is without; the pestilence and the famine within;
He that is in the field shall die by the sword;
And he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
But they that escape of them shall escape,
And be as the mountains like moaning doves,
All of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.
All hands shall be feeble, and every knee shall fail like water.
They shall gird themselves with sackcloth,
And horror shall cover them;
Shame shall be upon all faces, baldness upon all heads (verses 10-18).



What a solemn description of the doom which was now to
fall upon Jerusalem, the land and its inhabitants! The
buyer and the seller as well as all the multitude were to be
affected by it. The decree of judgment which had gone
forth could not be revoked. The blowing of the trumpet,
which is mentioned has generally been misunderstood by
expositors. It is said to picture "the collapse of Judah's
military preparations in the hour of danger, that when the
siege of Jerusalem came, none responded." The blowing of
the trumpets among Israel had a special significance. It
carried with it the assurance that Jehovah heard and would
be ready to fight for His people against their enemies. But
as they knew their iniquities had separated them from
God, His face being against them, none did go to the battle,
for His wrath rested upon them all. Sword, pestilence and
famine would devour them all and the few fugitives would be
upon the mountains mourning over their iniquities. The
rod mentioned which hath blossomed means Nebuchadnezzar,[51]
who executed this great judgment upon Jerusalem.
The climax of the judgment prophecy is reached in the
third part of the chapter.


They shall cast their silver in the streets,
And their gold shall be as an unclean thing;
Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them
In the day of Jehovah's wrath;
They cannot satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowls,
Because it was the stumbling block of their iniquity.
And the beauty of their ornaments, they turned it to pride,
And the images of their abominations, their detestable things made they of it.
And I shall give it to the hands of strangers for a prey,
And to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.
For I will turn my face from them,
And they shall defile my secret place,
And robbers shall enter into it and profane it.
Form a chain,
For the land is full of bloody crimes,
And the city full of violence.
Therefore will I bring the worst of the nations,
And they shall possess their houses;
And I will make the pride of the mighty to cease,
And their sanctuaries shall be defiled.
Destruction cometh!
They shall seek peace, but there shall be none.
Calamity after calamity shall appear;
And rumour shall be upon rumour;
Then shall they seek a vision from a prophet;
But the law shall perish from the priest,
And counsel from the elders.
The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with dismay,
And the hands of the people of the land shall tremble:
I will do unto them according to their way,
When I shall judge them according to their deserts;
And they shall know that I am the Lord (verses 19-27).


Here we learn first of all that the stumbling block of their
iniquity (verse 19) was the silver and gold. Prophets like[52]
Isaiah, Amos and others bear witness to the fact that Jerusalem
and the land enjoyed great prosperity and indulged in
extravagant living before the judgment overtook the
nation. Said Isaiah, "Their land also is full of silver and
gold, neither is there an end of their treasures." In
the third chapter of Isaiah the luxurious dress of the
daughters of Zion is vividly described, while Amos also gives
the scenes of their riotous, wanton living and emphasizes the
oppression of the poor. Riches had increased and the
prosperous conditions of the land produced vanity; they
forgot Jehovah and worshipped the idols of the Gentiles.
And now as the day of wrath breaks, their eyes would be
opened and they were to find out the absolute worthlessness
of their silver and gold. They would cast it into the
streets, for it was unable to deliver them. Zephaniah, in
his great vision of the national calamity which was to fall
upon the people, gives a similar testimony. "Neither their
silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day
of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured
by the fire of His jealousy; for He shall make even a speedy
riddance of all them that dwell in the land" (Zeph. i:18).

The Holy Spirit bears witness in the New Testament
that similar conditions will exist in Christendom during the
end of the present age. "Men shall be lovers of their ownselves,
lovers of money (covetous) and lovers of pleasure
more than lovers of God" (2 Tim. iii:1-5). The conditions
of worldliness, apostasy, prosperity and luxurious living
which prevailed in Jerusalem before the hand of God stripped
the people and the land characterize our times. This will
go on, and will culminate after the Lord has taken His
true church into glory. In view of the visible coming of
the Lord to deal with the earth in judgment the Spirit of
God through James addresses especially the rich men.
"Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries[53]
that shall come upon you.... Ye have heaped treasure
together for the last days" (James v:1-3).

The message of Ezekiel also announced that the Gentiles,
the strangers, were to come and defile the temple. The
chain mentioned refers to their condition as captives. Destruction
was to come. There should be no peace; calamity
was to follow calamity; according to what they had done a
righteous God would deal with them. And thus it came to
pass when Jerusalem fell and the people were taken away as
captives.


VISIONS CONCERNING JERUSALEM.

Chapter viii.

With this chapter begins a new section. It contains a
series of visions. The Prophet is shown first of all the
awful abominations which were going on in the temple
(chapter viii). Then the fact was made known to him
that destruction would overtake all who were left in Jerusalem,
except the sighing, faithful remnant, marked by
the man with the inkhorn (chapter xi). This is followed
by the vision of the coals of fire and the vision of glory
(chapter x). The final vision in this section is the vision
concerning the leaders of the people and the departure of
the glory of the Lord (chapter xi).

These visions, which concern Jerusalem's history and condition
in the days of Ezekiel, also foreshadow Jerusalem's
future. There is a remarkable correspondence with events
revealed in the last book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation.
Another temple will be defiled by the abomination
of the Anti-Christ during the coming great tribulation.
Ezekiel saw an image of jealousy, which provoketh to
jealousy. There will be another image in Jerusalem on
account of which judgment will come upon the unbelieving
Jews (Rev. xiii:14-15). Then there will be a remnant sealed[54]
and preserved (Rev. vii) as it was in the time of Ezekiel.
Coals of fire Ezekiel saw scattered over the city; it denoted
an act of judgment. When the last chapter of Jerusalem's
final trouble passeth into history, fire from the altar will be
cast upon the earth (Rev. viii:5). But while Ezekiel saw
the glory departing after these judgments, the glory will
return to the city and to Israel's land, when the great
tribulation is ended. Ezekiel's vision of abominations
among Israel is first given.


I. The Vision of the Image of Jealousy.

And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the
fifth of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah
sat before me, that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me.
Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the
appearance of his loins, even downward; fire and from his loins even
upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the look of glowing
brass. And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock
of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the
heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the
door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was
the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
And, behold the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to
the vision that I saw in the plain. Then said he unto me, Son of
man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I
lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward
at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?
even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth
here, and I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee
yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations (verses 1-6).

It was over a year after his first vision (i:1) when Ezekiel
sat in his house surrounded by the elders of Judah. Perhaps
they had come expecting some new communication from
the prophet. Suddenly the hand of the Lord fell again
upon him. He beheld once more the glorious likeness of[55]
Him who was the center of the first vision of glory.[9] The
hand of the Lord took the prophet by a lock of hair and the
Spirit lifted him between the earth and the heaven and he
was brought in the visions of God to Jerusalem. Was
this a real experience? Critics speak of a trance, that the
prophet was some kind of a psychic with the gift of clairvoyancy.
It was not a trance-vision, but an action by
the Spirit and power of the Lord. Elijah must have had
frequently the same experience, for Obadiah said to him:
"And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee,
that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know
not" (1 Kings xviii:12). And the sons of the prophets
said to Elisha after Elijah departed: "The Spirit of the
Lord hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain,
or into some valley" (2 Kings ii:16). The Spirit of the Lord
also caught away Philip (Acts viii:39).

In the visions of God Ezekiel is brought to the door of
the inner gate that looketh to the north. Here was the
image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. Some
have taken this and the following visions to be retrospective.
It has been said, "It was as if he were translated back to
Jerusalem, and to the time when these things were occurring."
Such is the view of some critics; however, it is untenable.
These visions would lose their meaning if the prophet only
seemed to be translated back to Jerusalem and to the time
when these abominations had happened in Israel's past
history. Later we find the names of persons given, whom
he saw. They certainly were living persons known to[56]
Ezekiel and his contemporaries. One of them died while
Ezekiel prophesied (xi:13).

What was the image of jealousy which provoketh to
jealousy? It was an idol. The word is used in Deut. iv:16,
where it is translated "graven image." It is also found
in 2 Chronicles xxxiii:7, 15, where it refers to the idol,
which Manasseh had made and put up in the temple.

After Manasseh's idolatry came Josiah's great reformation.
After his death Judah plunged into greater wickedness
under the reign of wicked kings and a revival of idolatry
followed once more. Such a wrath provoking idol was beheld
by the prophet. This image they worshipped. "Son of
man, seest thou what they do?" They must have lain
prostrate before that idol. And yet the glory of the God of
Israel was still there. He had not yet abandoned the place.
Idolatry will once more be practiced in Jerusalem. Our
Lord speaks of it prophetically in Matthew xii:43-45. The
unclean spirit is idolatry. The Jewish people are now
purged from it. At some future time that spirit will return
with seven others. "And the last state of that man is
worse than the first." Then our Lord applied the parable:
"Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation"
(literally: race). During the reign of the final Anti-Christ,
idolatry in its worst form will be instituted once more in
Jerusalem (2 Thess. ii:3-4; Rev. xiii:11-18).


II. The Worship of Creeping and Abominable Beasts.

And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
behold, a hole in the wall. Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig
now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold, a door.
And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations
that they do here. So I went in and saw; and, behold, every form
of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the
house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about. And there
stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel,[57]
and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with
every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went
up. Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the
chambers of his imagery? for they say, The Lord seeth us not; the
Lord hath forsaken the earth" (verses 7-12).

The prophet saw next a hole in the wall, and being commanded
to dig into it he found a secret door through which
he entered. In the chamber, upon the wall round about,
were pictured creeping things and abominable things.
A worship of these creeping things and beasts was in progress,
for the seventy ancients of Israel were swinging censers
full of incense, so that a thick cloud went up. They were
practising idolatry after the order of Egypt and of the
most degrading kind. The people of God had sunk as
deep, yea deeper, than the heathen round about them
(Romans i:23). And the leaders of the nation, the seventy
elders, were there leading in this worship of abominations.
Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, is especially mentioned.
Shaphan was the scribe, who received from the high-priest,
Hilkiah, the book of the law, and who read it before King
Josiah (2 Kings xxii:8-11; Jere. xxxix:14). The son of
this illustrious and God-fearing scribe was the leader among
the animal-worshippers. It was an evidence of the great
apostasy which had engulfed the nation. And these idol-worshippers,
each in his chamber of imagery (probably
individual cells) said: "The Lord seeth us not; the Lord
hath forsaken the earth." They denied His omniscience
and omnipresence. The apostasy in Christendom is
going the same road.


III. The Women Weeping for Tammuz.

He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see
greater abominations that they do. Then he brought me to the
door of the gate of the Lord's house which was toward the north;[58]
and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. Then said he
unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Turn thee yet again,
and thou shalt see greater abominations than these (verses 13-15).

Tammuz, the Babylonian "Dumuzi," was the god of spring
vegetation, who dies, going down to Hades, and revives
again with each returning summer. The worship of this
god became identified with Phoenicia, and from there this
wicked cult came to Greece, where Tammuz was known
under the name of Adonis. The weeping woman celebrated
the death of the god, an emblem of the decay of earth's
productive powers. With it were connected some of the
vilest, immoral ceremonies and licentious habits. Thus
we see how false worship and immorality are closely, yea,
inseparably, linked together. In our days the increase of
licentiousness is but the result of having rejected the Truth
of God.


IV. The Greatest of all Abominations: Sun-Worship.

And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house; and,
behold at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and
the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward
the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they
worshipped the sun toward the east. Then he said unto me, Hast
thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of
Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit
here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned
to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.
Therefore, will I also deal in fury; mine eye shall not spare, neither
will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud
voice, yet will I not hear them" (verses 16-18).

The twenty-five men, who stood between the porch and
the altar with their backs to the house of the Lord and
their faces towards the sun, worshipping the sun, were the
twenty-four priests, who constituted the appointed courses.
Their attitude was one of defiance. They practiced the
abominable cult, openly showing by the turned backs[59]
against the temple that they had wilfully rejected Jehovah
and His worship. What else was connected with sun-worship?
One mysterious sentence appears at the close of
verse 17. "And, lo, they put the branch to their nose."
This phrase is very obscure. Jewish commentators claim
that the words conceal some shocking and wicked rite;
and this may be the correct meaning. Sun-worship and
its attending lusts of the flesh are not unknown in our
own times. A few months ago a great sun-festival was
held in Paris.[10] Thousands participated in it. Hymns
to the sun were sung and sun-dances held, while the nights
were given over to all kinds of immoralities. Bahaism,
whose deceitful leader is a sun-worshipper, has hundreds
of thousands of followers in the English speaking world.
They turned their ears from the Truth and have been turned
to fables.

Elders, women and priests had turned from Jehovah and
His worship. And now Jehovah speaks and pronounces
judgment upon them. "Therefore will I also deal in fury;
mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and
though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I
not hear them." Jehovah did according to His word. He
did not spare; there was no pity. Jerusalem and the temple
were destroyed and the people had to feel Jehovah's fury.
And judgment greater than Jerusalem's will surely overtake
this present evil age with its idolatries, its abominations,
its rejection of God's Gospel and defiance of God.

[60]
THE VISION OF THE MAN WITH THE INKHORN.

Chapter ix.

The vision which follows is closely connected with the previous
visions in which Ezekiel had seen the worship of idols,
and of beasts, and of the sun. Divine judgment must follow.
It is a judgment vision the Prophet now beholds. The
judgment, however, is of a discriminating character. The
messengers are commissioned to mark the sorrowing, faithful
remnant. For the rest of the sinners in Jerusalem there is
no mercy. They had defiled the temple and now the temple
was to be defiled by their slain bodies.


I. The Judgment Command Given.

He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them
that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with
his destroying weapon in his hand. And, behold, six men came
from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and
every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among
them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side:
and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar. And the
glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon
he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man
clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;
and the Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,
through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads
of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be
done in the midst thereof. And to the others he said in mine hearing,
Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye
spare, neither have ye pity. Slay utterly old and young, both
maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any
man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary
(verses 1-6).

Who are they who are called to execute the judgment?
Six men came from the way of the higher gate, one of them
clothed in linen had a writer's inkhorn by his side, while
the others had slaughter weapons in their hands. They[61]
were not human beings but angels. The city was given over
into their hands. Angels were therefore used in God's
judgments of the past. They will be used in the coming
judgments. "The Son of Man shall send forth His angels,
and they shall gather out of His Kingdom all things that
offend and them which do iniquity" (Matt. xiii:41). "For
the Son of Man shall come in the glory of His Father with
His angels" (Matt. xvi:27). "When the Lord Jesus shall
be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming
fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and
that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ" (2 Thess.
i:7-8). Throughout the book of Revelation angels are
seen carrying out the judgments of God. Especially are
we reminded here of the seventh chapter of the last book of
the Bible. Four angels are seen there holding the four
winds of the earth. Then there appeared a fifth angel
having the seal of the living God. He cried with a loud
voice to the four angels: "Hurt not the earth, neither the
sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our
God in their foreheads" (Rev. vii:1-3). One hundred and
forty-four thousand were then sealed. The sealed ones in
Revelation with the mark on the forehead constitute the
faithful remnant of Israel who witness during the tribulation.
Those who die the martyr's death will have part in the first
resurrection, because they did not worship the beast nor
received his mark on their foreheads (Rev. xx:4). Those
who will be kept through the tribulation will be the nucleus
of the Kingdom on earth. We notice a striking correspondency
with this vision of Ezekiel. Judgment is to fall
upon all the apostates in Jerusalem, but the men that sigh
and cry on account of the abominations were to be marked
by the angel with the inkhorn and escape the impending
judgment. Their sighing and weeping was the evidence
that they did not share the abominations of idolatry but were[62]
true to Jehovah and His worship. And may we not forget
that now in Christendom, in the midst of the dark days
of apostasy and the soon coming tribulation and judgment,
there is a faithful remnant, who sigh and cry and to whom
the Lord has given a special promise: "Because thou hast
kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from
the hour of trial, which shall come upon all the world, to
try them that dwell on the earth" (Rom. iii:10).

The word "mark" in the Hebrew is "Tav," the last letter in
the Hebrew alphabet. Its literal meaning is "cross."
This letter "T" was a cross in the older Hebrew script as
well as in the Phoenician and Samaritan. The Egyptians
also used a cross in their language; with them it was a
sign of life. Ancient Jewish tradition gives the information
that the blood sprinkled in Egypt on the doorpost (Exodus
xii:23) was in the form of a cross. All this is interesting.
To this we may add that in Genesis iv:15, the mark set
upon Cain, an entirely different word is used.

"Begin at my sanctuary" was the command. There the
responsibility rested and there the judgment had to begin.
1 Peter iv:17 may here be considered. "For the time is
come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and
if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey
not the Gospel of God."


II. The Command Executed.

Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.
And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the
slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.
And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left,
that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah, Lord God! wilt thou
destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon
Jerusalem? Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of
Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood,
and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The Lord hath
forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not. And as for me also,[63]
mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will
recompense their way upon their head. And, behold, the man
clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported
the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me
(verses 7-11).

The command is literally carried out. God's judgments
are always carried out to the letter; there is no such thing
as a "spiritual" fulfillment of a judgment of God. The
world some day will find out the solemn truth of this fact.
The temple where they had practised all the vileness of
idolatry, where they worshipped creeping things, is now
defiled by their dead bodies. To touch a dead body anywhere
meant defilement for seven days (Num. xix:11), but
now the very place which they considered holy is made a
defiled place. The Priest-Prophet is shocked. He fell on
his face and a cry of horror escaped his lips. "Ah, Lord God!
wilt Thou destroy all the residue of Israel in Thy pouring
out of Thy fury upon Jerusalem?" Was it not contrary to
God's holiness to defile the place dedicated to Himself?
And would He not show mercy and destroy the residue of
His people? The despairing cry is answered at once. The
iniquity of the house of Israel and the house of Judah was
filled up. God could no longer pity nor spare. This is
but a repetition of what Jehovah had announced before.
(See chapter v:11; vii:4; viii:18.)

"And behold, the man clothed in linen, which had the
inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have
done as Thou hast commanded me."[64]


THE VISION OF THE COALS OF FIRE AND THE
VISION OF THE DEPARTING GLORY.

Chapter x.

After the Prophet had seen the marking of the faithful
ones in the doomed city, two other visions follow. They also
relate to the impending judgment of the doomed city.
The first vision indicates the fire by which the city would be
consumed, and the second, another vision of the glory,
shows how that glory was gradually departing from Jerusalem.
The complete departure is recorded in the eleventh
chapter.


I. The Vision of the Coals of Fire.

Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament of the cherubim
there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance
of the likeness of a throne. And he spake unto the man
clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even the
under cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between
the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in
my sight. Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house,
when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. Then
the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub, and stood over the
threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud,
and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory. And the
sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court,
as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. And it came
to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen,
saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the
cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels. And
one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim
unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof,
and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen;
who took it, and went out (verses 1-7).

Once more the Prophet beholds in the firmament above
the cherubim the likeness of a throne. It is the throne of
the Lord. However, the occupant of the throne is not seen;[65]
His voice only is heard. The man clothed with linen is
commanded to go in between the wheels, under the cherub,
to fill his hands with coals of fire and then to scatter them
over the city. Who is this man clothed in linen? He
appeared for the first time in the preceding chapter. With
the inkhorn at his side, he set the mark upon the foreheads
of the faithful ones. Here we see him again executing the
judgment upon Jerusalem. Judgment is given into his
hands. That he is a supernatural being is clear. And he is
more than an angel. He held the place of pre-eminence
among the other angels (chapter ix:2-4). This angel is
the Angel of the Lord, the same who appeared to the Patriarchs,
to Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Manoah and to others.
It is the Son of God in the garb of an angel. In the same
form he also appeared to Daniel on the banks of the river
Hiddekel. "Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and
behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were
girded with fine gold of Uphaz. His body also was like
the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and
his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in
color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the
voice of a multitude" (Dan. x:5-6). Here we have a complete
description of the same person whom Ezekiel saw
taking the coals of fire and scattering them over Jerusalem.
Judgment upon the guilty city came from his hands.

When we turn to the Book of Revelation, we find a
similar scene which has not yet been enacted. "And another
angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer;
and there was given to him much incense that he should
offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar
which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense,
which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before
God out of the angel's hand. And the Angel took the
censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the[66]
earth; and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings
and an earthquake" (Rev. viii:3-5). This angel who
presents the prayers before the throne and who casts the
judgment fire into the earth is the One who received from
God's hands the seven sealed book (Rev. v:1), the Lamb
of God, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. This Angel-Priest,
into whose hands also judgment is committed, is the Son
of God. John saw Him dealing in judgment with the
earth, a judgment which has not yet come, and Ezekiel
beheld Him as the executor of the judgment upon Jerusalem,
which was carried out through Nebuchadnezzar, King of
Babylon.

Ezekiel saw the man clothed in linen enter in between the
wheels. As he went in the cherubim, these majestic creatures
of God, stood at the right side of the house, while the cloud
filled the inner court. This cloud is the visible sign of
Jehovah's presence (Exod. xix:9; xxiv:15-18; Numbers
ix:19; xii:10; 1 Kings viii:10). Then the glory of the Lord
went up; the withdrawing from the city began. It stood
over the threshold of the house which was filled with the
cloud and the whole court was full of the brightness of the
Lord's glory. From the hand of the cherub, the man in
linen cloth received the fire that was between the cherubim.
And he took it and went out.


II. The Vision of the Departing Glory.

And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand
under their wings. And when I looked, behold the four wheels by
the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by
another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the color
of a chrysolite stone. And as for their appearances, they four had
one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. When
they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as
they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed
it; they turned not as they went. And their whole body, and
their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels,[67]
were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that the
four had. As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in
my hearing, O wheel. And every one had four faces: the first
face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a
man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an
eagle. And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living
creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. And when the cherubim
went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubim lifted
up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also
turned not from beside them. When they stood, these stood;
and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also:
for the spirit of the living creature was in them. Then the glory
of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood
over the cherubim. And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and
mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the
wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door
of the east gate of the Lord's house; and the glory of the God
of Israel was over them above. This is the living creature that
I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew
that they were the cherubim. Every one had four faces a piece,
and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man
was under their wings. And the likeness of their faces was the same
faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and
themselves; they went every one straight forward (verses 8-22).

One would naturally expect after the man clothed in
linen had taken the coals of fire and gone out to scatter them
over Jerusalem, that the next vision the Prophet had,
would be the burning of the city itself. Instead of receiving
a vision of the judgment work he beholds once more
the glory of the Lord. The similarity with the great vision
in the first chapter needs hardly to be pointed out. However,
the order of the description differs from that of the
opening vision of this book. Critics have seen in this fact
the evidence of some other writer who interpolated the repetition
of the vision of the glory of the Lord. But if such were
the case the person who did it would have not dared to make
these changes. The differences in the vision demonstrates[68]
that Ezekiel is the writer and not some other person. He
beheld the same vision as in the beginning by the river
Chebar only from another viewpoint. Wheels and cherubim
are seen first ready for the departure from the city.
The eyes are made more prominent than in the first vision.
"Full of eyes" we read in chapter i:18. Here in this vision
eyes are everywhere. "And their whole body, and their
backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels,
were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that the
four had." This symbolizes the omniscience of God. After
the description of the cherubim and the wheels, the solemn
command is given for the start. Verse 13 may be rendered:
"In my hearing, unto the wheels, even unto them, it was
proclaimed: Whirl wheels." Once more the prophet beholds
the faces of the cherubim. And here is a striking
change. In the opening vision Ezekiel saw their faces in
the following order: The face of a man; the face of a lion;
these were on the right side. The four had the face of an
ox on the left side; these four also had the face of an eagle
(chapter i:10). But now Ezekiel sees the face of the
cherub first of all, then the face of a man, a lion and an
eagle. The cherubim were beheld by the prophet from a
different angle and the face of the cherub[11] appears as
identified with that of the ox. That the vision did not
differ at all from the first great vision Ezekiel expressly
affirms at the close. "And the likeness of their faces was
the same faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their
appearances and themselves: They went every one straight
forward" (verse 22).

Then when the command had been given, "Whirl wheels!"
everything is set in motion. The cherubim went, the
[69]wheels went beside them. The mighty wings of the cherubim
were lifted up to mount up from the earth; the wheels
never swerved from their side. When the cherubim stood,
the wheels stood. The energizing Spirit was in all. The
Glory of the Lord departed from the threshold of the
temple; over its portals "Ichabod" (the glory is departed)
was now to be written. Then in Ezekiel's sight the cherubim
mounted up from the earth. They halted at the door
of the east gate of the Temple. Above it was the Glory
of the Lord. Thus, gradually, in solemn majesty, the Glory
of the Lord, which had dwelt visibly in the Temple in the
midst of His people, was departing. Verse 22 of chapter xi
connects with verse 19 of chapter x. The complete departure
of the Glory of the Lord from the midst of the city we
find recorded there. Here in our chapter the cherubim
with the Glory of the Lord above them stood at the east
gate of the Lord's house. From there its final departure
took place. But the visions Ezekiel had seen were beheld
once more in his great vision of that temple which will yet
be erected in Jerusalem. That departed glory will then
return. "And the Glory of the Lord came into the house
by the way of the gate whose front was toward the east"
(chapter xliii:4). It will return in the same way as it
departed. And that will be when the King, our Lord,
comes back to earth again. Then the Glory will cover
Israel and Jerusalem (Is. iv:5; lx:1) and the knowledge of
it covers the earth as the waters the deep.[70]


CONCERNING THE LEADERS. PROMISE OF RESTORATION.
THE GLORY DEPARTS.

Chapter xi.

This chapter concludes the visions concerning the doom
of Jerusalem. At the close of the previous chapter we saw
the Glory of the Lord getting ready to leave the doomed
city. The complete withdrawal is recorded now. However,
before we reach this we find a prophecy uttered against
the leaders of the people. Then the Prophet received a
comforting message about the future restoration and blessing
of the nation. This is the first restoration promise in
this book. It is repeated and enlarged in the great predictions
after the fall of Jerusalem.


I. The Prophecy against the Leaders.

Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east
gate of the Lord's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the
door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah,
the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the
people. Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that
devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city; which say,
It is not near; let us build houses; this city is the cauldron, and we
be the flesh.

Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. And
the Spirit of the Lord fell upon men, and said unto me, Speak;
Thus saith the Lord, Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I
know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.
Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the
streets thereof with the slain. Therefore thus saith the Lord God,
Your slain, whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh,
and this city is the cauldron: but I will bring you forth out of the
midst of it. Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword
upon you, saith the Lord God. And I will bring you out of the
midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and
will execute judgments among you. Ye shall fall by the sword:
I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I
am the Lord. This city shall not be your cauldron, neither shall[71]
ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the
border of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the Lord: for ye
have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgements,
but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round
about you.

And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of
Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a
loud voice, and said, Ah, Lord God! wilt thou make a full end of the
remnant of Israel? (verses 1-13).

The Prophet had watched the movements of the cherubim
and the glory of the Lord, and now he is again suddenly
transported to the east gate of the Lord's house. At the
door of the gate he beholds twenty-five men. He recognized
among them Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah
the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. In the eighth
chapter he had also seen, between the porch and the altar,
twenty-five men with their backs towards the temple (viii:16).
In that chapter Jaazaniah is mentioned. The question
then arises, is this the same company Ezekiel sees once
more and against which he utters his denunciatory message?
They cannot be identical with the men in the previous
chapter, for they belonged evidently to the priestly class,
while the twenty-five men in this chapter are leaders, or
princes, of the people. Nor is the Jaazaniah the same as
in the eighth chapter. Here is a Jaazaniah who was the
son of Azur, while the other Jaazaniah was the son of Shaphan.
These princes here may be the same of whom we
read in Jeremiah xxxviii:4.

It shows the complete corruption of Jerusalem. The
priesthood and the leaders of the nation were steeped in
wickedness and defied God and the judgment He had announced
through Jeremiah, and now also through Ezekiel.
Interesting are the names of those mentioned, Jaazaniah
("He will be heard of the Lord"); Azur ("Helper"); Pelatiah
("Delivered of the Lord"); Benaiah ("Built up of the[72]
Lord"). Their names indicate that they knew the Lord
and His truth and yet they had turned deliberately from
Him and from His Word. They devised mischief (or iniquity)
and gave wicked counsel. Their wicked counsel
consisted in disobedience against Jehovah and His Word.
In regard to the judgment they said, "It is not the time to
build houses; this is the cauldron and we are the flesh."
They knew of Jeremiah's letter which he had sent to the
elders which were carried away captives. In that letter,
Jeremiah, believing God's Word concerning the long duration
of the captivity, gave the advice, "Build ye houses and
dwell in them" (Jere. xxix). They ridiculed that divinely
given advice. They still thought themselves safe in Jerusalem.
The phrase "this is the cauldron" means the city of
Jerusalem; and we are the "flesh" themselves. As the
flesh in the cauldron is preserved from the fire by the cauldron
itself, so they felt themselves secure in the doomed
city. That these wicked leaders were still in the city shows
that the judgment in chapter ix was not a complete judgment.
It began at the sanctuary, and the wicked worshippers
Ezekiel saw in his vision were smitten first of all, while
the man with the inkhorn marked the entire remnant for
preservation. Then the Spirit fell upon Ezekiel and he
uttered Jehovah's message. Their proverb about the cauldron
and the flesh is used to announce their own doom. Those
whom they had slain were the flesh, not they the living ones;
the slain ones had the city for a cauldron. But the defiant
leaders, who cast the judgment predictions to the
winds, would be brought forth out of the city, the place of
their supposed security. They feared the sword and it
would come upon them. Solemnly the Lord declared, "This
city shall not be your cauldron, neither shall ye be the flesh
in the midst thereof; I will judge you in the border of Israel."
And thus it came true. Nebuchadnezzar received his prisoners[73]
on the borders, the territory of the kingdom of Israel, at
Riblah (2 Kings xxv:18-21; Jer. lii:24-27).

All this finds a repetition in the present age. God has
spoken. Long ago He has in His Word announced the
judgment upon this present age. Men, religious men, leaders
among the people, like these twenty-five, reject His
Word and do not believe in the threatened judgments.
"Peace and safety" is their false hope. But the day is coming
and not far off when all who reject the Word of God will find
out, to their eternal shame and loss, that His Word is true.

And while the Prophet delivered faithfully his message,
the Lord touched one of the men; Pelatiah suddenly died.
He may have stood there with sneering lips, defying the
Lord's mouthpiece, when sudden death was meted out to
him. It was a divine seal upon the words they had heard.
This act of judgment greatly impressed the Prophet and he
prayed for the preservation of the remnant of Israel. Knowing
the sad condition of the people he loved so well, he
feared that they all would be taken away. May we also,
in the days of impending judgments make use of the prayer
of intercession. The next paragraph contains the answer
Ezekiel received.


II. The Message of Restoration and Blessing.

Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all
the house of Israel, wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of
Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the Lord: unto us is this land
given in possession. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God:
Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although
I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as
a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. Therefore
say, Thus saith the Lord God; I will even gather you from the
people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been
scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. And they shall
come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things[74]
thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. And I will
give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I
will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an
heart of flesh: That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine
ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will
be their God. But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart
of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense
their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord God
(verses 14-21).

It is the first message of comfort Ezekiel received. They
were to be scattered among the nations, yet Jehovah promises,
"I will be to them a little[12] sanctuary in the countries
where they shall come." This refers to the remnant who
still clings to Him and hopes in the fulfilment of His promises.
Then follows the great outlook into their future.
Blessed promises! They are the hope of Israel. Their regathering,
their return from exile is here definitely predicted
by Ezekiel. Moses before had announced the same future
restoration. So did Isaiah and Jeremiah as well as the
earlier prophets. The denial of the literal regathering of
Israel means the denial of the Word of the Lord. They will
receive the land of Israel. But greater things are promised
to the people. The stony heart is to be taken away; they are
to receive a heart of flesh. This is the result of the new Spirit,
His Spirit, which they will receive. It means the new birth
of that nation to enter into the promised kingdom. Then
the result will be an obedient people. "They shall be my
people and I will be their God." Has this been fulfilled in
the return of the feeble remnant from Babylon? Many believe
that Ezekiel's message found then its accomplishment.
It is not so. The nation was not put into possession of the
great blessings which are everywhere linked with their literal
restoration and possession of the land. Ezekiel's great[75]
visions of the national restoration of Israel and the greater
spiritual blessings are still unfulfilled. They will be fulfilled
when the Glory of the Lord, that is the Lord of Glory,
their rejected King, the Son of David, the King of Israel,
returns.

III. The Glory Departs.

Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels beside
them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and
stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.

Afterwards the Spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by
the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the
vision that I had seen went up from me. Then I spake unto them
of the captivity all the things that the Lord had shewed me
(verses 22-25).

After this comforting message of future blessing for the
nation and restoration to the land, the Glory of the Lord
holds its departure. We saw how it gradually withdrew
from the temple, where it had dwelt. Now the complete
departure from the city has come. But it is a blessed
thought, before that takes place, Jehovah gave His Word
that He would return and be again with His people. "The
Glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and
stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the
city." That mountain is the Mount of Olives. Significant
place where the Shekinah, the Glory of the Lord with
its cherubim and wheels was seen for the last time. Upon
that mountain He stood, who is the Glory Himself, our Lord
Jesus Christ. From there He went back to the Father.
And in a coming day "His feet will stand upon the Mount
of Olives." And when He comes back in visible glory,
Israel and Jerusalem will behold the return of the Glory
of the Lord, Ezekiel saw departing from temple and city.
Then that will happen what has never been in Israel's past
history: "All the earth will be filled with His Glory."
[76]


MESSAGES AND PARABLES.

Chapter xii.

A new section of this book begins with the twelfth chapter
and ends with chapter xix. The judgments the Prophet
had announced, the great visions he had seen, all showing
the impending doom of Jerusalem, were not believed
nor heeded by the people. This is announced by a direct
communication from the Lord in the beginning of this
chapter. After he had seen the departure of the Glory
of the Lord, he spoke unto them of the captivity all the
things that the Lord had shown unto him (xi:25). Perhaps
some time elapsed before the Word of the Lord came
unto him revealing the unbelieving, rebellious condition
of the people. "Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a
rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they
have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious
house" (verse 2). Therefore the speedy judgment is again
announced and the Prophet received a series of messages
and parables. "The Word of the Lord came," and "Thus
saith the Lord," are the oft-repeated phrases in this most
interesting chapter. We shall find many solemn truths in
this section, truths which have a meaning for our times as
well. May we hear His voice in these words which the
Prophet-Priest heard from Jehovah. The first chapter of this
section has two parts.


I. The Symbolical Sign of the Certainty and Nearness of
the Judgment.

The word of the Lord also came unto me, saying, Son of man,
thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes
to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not; for they
are a rebellious house. Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee
stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou
shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may
be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house. Then[77]
shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for
removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they
that go forth into captivity. Dig thou through the wall in their
sight, and carry out thereby. In their sight shalt thou bear it upon
thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt
cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee
for a sign, unto the house of Israel. And I did so as I was commanded;
I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and
in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it
forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight
(verses 1-7).

In the commission which the Prophet received (chapter ii)
the rebellious condition of the people had been declared
by the Lord, and now once more the fact that they were "a
rebellious house" is mentioned. They had eyes and did
not see, ears and they did not hear. Moses had spoken of
that (Deut. xxix:1-4) and their past history up to the
days of Ezekiel only confirmed the truth of this statement.
Isaiah had heard the same words from the Lord (Is. vi:9-10)
and Jeremiah had to repeat them in his great call to a backslidden
people (Jere. v:21). Then our Lord used the same
words when the nation had rejected His testimony (Matt.
xiii:13-15; Mark viii:18; John xii:39-40). The last time
we find them applied is in Acts xxviii:26-27. Blindness
is now upon Israel, but the day is also coming when that
judicial blindness will be removed and they will be no
longer the rebellious house. Of this coming great miracle
of the Grace of God Ezekiel's later prophecies have much
to say.

Here the Prophet is told to act again in a symbolical
sign. He was told to prepare stuff for removing. This
meant that he should attire himself like one who goes on a
journey with sandals on his feet, a staff in his hand, a burden
upon his shoulders. Then he was to remove from one place
to another. He was also to bring forth his stuff in their sight,[78]
and then with the captive's burden upon his back he was
commanded to dig through the wall and carry it through
the hole. Furthermore he was to cover his face so that
he did not see the ground. All this the prophet did in the
sight of the people. In all this the Lord in His infinite
patience, in making the Prophet a sign unto them, waited
still for their repentance; "it may be they will consider,
though they be a rebellious house."

We find the meaning of all this explained in the verses
which follow:

And in the morning came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,
Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said
unto thee, What doest thou? Say thou unto them, Thus saith the
Lord God; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all
the house of Israel that are among them. Say, I am your sign;
like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove
and go into captivity. And the prince that is among them shall
bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth:
they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover
his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes. My net also will
I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will
bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall
he not see it, though he shall die there. And I will scatter toward
every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands;
and I will draw out the sword after them. And they shall know
that I am the Lord, when I shall scatter them among the nations,
and disperse them in the countries. But I will leave a few men of
them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence;
that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen
whither they come; and they shall know that I am the Lord
(verses 8-16).

The actions of the Prophet were witnessed by the people
and they said to him, What doest thou? The answer to
their inquiry is given by the Lord Himself. We have therefore
the divine interpretation of what Ezekiel had done in
their presence. It is a prophecy and concerns mostly "the[79]
prince in Jerusalem"; Zedekiah is meant. His attempt to
flee from Jerusalem and his fate when the king of Babylon
put out his eyes, his captivity in the land of the Chaldeans
and death in that land are here clearly predicted. Jeremiah
xxxix:4; lii:10-11 and 2 Kings xxv:1-7 must be read in
connection with the sign of Ezekiel and the interpretation
as given by the Lord. Thus Ezekiel had enacted a prophecy
before their eyes which came literally true. Certain critics
have tried to explain that what Ezekiel did must have
happened after the fall of Jerusalem and the capture of
Zedekiah. However, this attempt to disprove the passage
as a real prophecy has failed. Others have tried to explain
it in still another way. It has been said: "Since we know
that the book was written after the event, it is a perfectly
fair question whether in the interpretation of the symbols
Ezekiel may not have read into it a fuller meaning than was
present to his own mind at the time." This statement sets
aside the fact that not Ezekiel gave the interpretation and
read something into it, but the whole passage is the Word of
the Lord, introduced with "Thus saith the Lord God."
Predictions of any kind revealing future events seems to be
the unpalatable thing for the destructive criticism, for it
proves the fact of divine revelation. We have followed
step by step the different judgment messages and visions
which the Prophet received and delivered, how Jerusalem
was facing its certain doom and now Zedekiah and his fate
in trying to escape from Jerusalem is especially mentioned.
All these visions are closely connected and were all given
before the city fell.

And what the Lord predicted here, not alone about
Zedekiah, but also about the people and their dispersion
came true. They were scattered among the nations, but
a full end of them was not made, a remnant was to be left
and to declare their abominations among the nations.[80]
Scattered in all countries they witness by their condition as a
homeless nation to their own disobedience and shame.

Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man,
eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling
and with carefulness; And say unto the people of the land, Thus
saith the Lord God of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land
of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink
their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from
all that is therein because of the violence of all them that dwell
therein. And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste,
and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the
Lord (verses 17-20).

An additional message is given. Ezekiel was to eat his
bread with quaking and drink his water with dread and
anxious care. It was another sign of the affliction which was
to come upon them. The land also should become desolate
and the cities be laid waste. Thus the Lord continued to
warn and plead with His people. Judgment is always his
strange work (Is. xxxiii:21). "For He doth not afflict
willingly nor grieve the children of men? (Lam. iii:33). The
unheeded warnings were repeated over and over again by
Ezekiel and the other prophets; He waited in His infinite
patience for the return of His people and, as we learn from the
Book of Judges, if there is but a cry from the heart of His
people, He is ready to respond. But Israel heard not.
They made light of all the predictions of the rapidly nearing
judgment. When we think of our own times and generation,
and remember the deliberate rejection of God's Word,
the impenitence and worldliness prevalent in Christendom,
and the judgments which are threatened and which must
come some day, these opening messages of Ezekiel and their
fulfilment in the judgment of Jerusalem and the nation
take on an additional meaning. God must needs do His
strange work, the work of judgment upon those who reject[81]
the best He has given, the Gospel of His Grace. The
condition of the people is now more fully seen in the second
part of this chapter.


II. The False Hope. The Judgment not to be Delayed.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying Son of man, what
is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days
are prolonged, and every vision faileth? Tell them, therefore,
Thus saith the Lord God; I will make this proverb to cease, and
they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them,
The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision. For there shall
be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the
house of Israel. For I am the Lord: I will speak, and the word
that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged:
for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will
perform it, saith the Lord God.

Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man,
behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is
for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far
off. Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; There
shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which
I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord God (verses 21-28).

We must again remember in reading these words that in
the midst of Israel false prophets deluded the people with
their false messages. The rebellious spirit against the Lord
was fostered by these men and the threatening judgments
announced by Jeremiah and by Ezekiel were not believed
by the mass of the people. Of them we read elsewhere:
"Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee,
and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away
thy captivity, but have seen for thee false burdens and
causes of banishment" (Lam. ii:14). Believing the false
messages the people said, "The days are prolonged, and every
vision faileth." Had they really believed that the days
were not to be prolonged and that the vision of judgment
upon Jerusalem was about to be accomplished, they would[82]
have surely turned to the Lord and cried to Him for mercy.
Unbelief was responsible for their condition, and in that
unbelief they were sustained by the lying prophets. In the
next chapter the Prophet utters his God-given denunciation
of these false prophets and prophetesses.

All this is present with us to-day. Blinded Israel then
did not believe what the Lord had spoken. They thought
themselves secure, that the days would be prolonged and
that the visions had failed. It is so to-day. The Spirit
of God has predicted this for the end of the present age:
"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where
is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep
all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
creation" (2 Peter iii:3-4). This is the spirit to-day which
has permeated the larger part of the professing church.
What God has said concerning the future, the Coming again
of His Son to judge the world in righteousness is either
ignored or rejected, while many even ridicule these great
predictions. It is the popular opinion that our age is constantly
getting better, they dream of world-peace, great
advancement and prosperity. That God has written a
different program in His Word revealed by the Prophets
of God in visions and confirmed by our Lord and His Apostles
is completely forgotten. And this setting aside of the Word
of Prophecy has produced in Christendom similar conditions
to those in unbelieving Israel. And there are others who
assent in a measure to the visions of the Prophets concerning
things to come, but they are unconcerned about it. It has
no meaning for them. Like Israel they say, "The vision that
he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of
the times that are afar off" (verse 27). It reminds us of
the language of the evil servant who said, "My lord delayeth
his coming."[83]

But what was God's answer? He would end this false
hope and false security. The lying proverb which the false
prophets had them inspired to use would be changed into
another. "The days are at hand and the effect of every
vision." All false visions, false divinations and false hopes
which had become so widespread among Israel were to cease,
for the burden of true Prophecy would now be fulfilled.
Then solemnly He declared that His Word was to be done.
The Word which He spoke would come to pass. Even so
every word which the Prophets had spoken concerning the
judgment of Jerusalem, the devastation of the land and the
dispersion of the people came to pass.

May we remember that when the world says "Peace and
safety," then sudden destruction shall come upon them
(1 Thess. v:1-5). The world and an apostate church may
dream of peace and safety, sneer at divine interference in
mighty judgments, laugh at a second, visible and glorious
coming of the same Lord who died and was raised from the
dead, ridicule the establishment of His great kingdom on
this earth and say every vision faileth&mdash;yet we know that
the vision will not fail. What God has spoken will be done.
The vision may yet be for an appointed time, but at the end
it shall speak and not lie; though it tarry, wait for it; because
it will surely come; it will not tarry (Hab. ii:3). "Say unto
them, The days are at hand." This was God's message to a
people deceived by false hopes of peace. And may this not
be the Lord's message to us in these dark and solemn days,
when the clouds of judgment are gathering, the days are at
hand? May we as the children of light and of the day
wait for the fulfilment of the vision. It will surely come
and not tarry.[84]


THE MESSAGE AGAINST THE FALSE PROPHETS
AND PROPHETESSES.

Chapter xiii.

The message which follows the preceding one on the
certainty of the doom of Jerusalem is directed against the
false prophets and prophetesses who were at work among
the people, and who antagonized the God-given utterances
of the true messengers of the Lord. These men and women
may well be termed the curse of Israel, because all they did
was a curse to the people. Their words inspired the rebellious
people with a false hope and kept them from turning
to the Lord in true repentance. They advocated a national
alliance of Israel with Egypt and other empires, while the
true prophets exhorted Israel to put their confidence exclusively
in the Lord. The false prophets paid no heed to the
moral and religious conditions of the people of God. They
saw nothing alarming in the drift away from God, in the
increasing immoralities, but in view of all this they continued
to cry peace, peace; but the true prophets sounded the
alarm and without mincing words uncovered the degenerating
conditions of the people.


I. The False Prophets: their Guilt and Condemnation.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man
prophesying against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say
thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye
the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord God; Woe unto the
foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts. Ye have
not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house
of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord. They have
seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The Lord saith: and the
Lord hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that
they would confirm the word. Have ye not seen a vain vision,
and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The
Lord saith it, albeit I have not spoken? (verses 1-7).[85]

The first charge brought against the false prophets is
that they prophesy out of their own hearts. It has been
also translated "who prophesy from their own mind without
having seen." Here we have a divine definition of the
false prophets in a very concise form. Their words came
out of their own hearts, they were not founded upon the
vision of the Lord, the message He gives by His Spirit, but
the product of their own minds. They gave expression to
the thoughts of their own darkened hearts and paid no
heed whatever to the revelation of God. And here let us be
reminded of what is written in the New Testament concerning
the same class of men who are predicted to appear
especially at the close of the present age, doing a work in
Christendom which fully corresponds to the work of these
false prophets in Jeremiah's and Ezekiel's day. "But there
were false prophets also among the people (Israel), even as
there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall
bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that
bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
And many shall follow their pernicious ways, by reason of
whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of" (2 Peter
ii:1-2). Jude in his Epistle gives a more complete picture
of them. He speaks of these false teachers of Christendom
as "speaking evil of those things which they know not, but
what they know naturally (as natural men, unregenerated)
as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves"
(verse 10). "Their mouth speaketh great swelling words
(a divine definition of modern day 'pulpit oratory'), having
men's persons in admiration because of advantage" (verse
16). They were mockers who walk after their own lusts;
having not the Spirit (verse 19). The Apostle Paul speaks
of them as wolves (Acts xx:29) and our Lord warned of
them. "Beware of false Prophets, which come to you in[86]
sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves"
(Matt. vii:15).

And such false teachers, men who pose as religious leaders,
are doing their dreadful and delusive work throughout the
professing church. Every man who prophesies out of his
own heart, who utters his own mind, whose teaching and
preaching is not according to the oracles of God, who pays
no heed to what the Lord has said is a false prophet. And
such abound in the closing days of the church on earth.
Hundreds of men who are accredited religious teachers
ignore the visions of God, have no heart and no ear for what
the Lord has revealed, yea, more than that, they reject the
inspiration and revelation of the Word of God and in its
place preach and teach the opinions of their own corrupt
and darkened minds and the traditions of men. A true
prophet of God and a true leader is altogether subject to
the Word of God. His one business is to expound the Word
of God. He speaks as the oracles of God. He does what
is written in 2 Cor. x:5: "Casting down imaginations (the
working of the mind apart from the Word of God) and every
high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God,
and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience
of Christ." The Apostle Paul is a perfect example of such
a true mouthpiece of the Lord. Naturally gifted with
a keen mind, learned and cultured, yet he wrote to the
Corinthians, "And I, brethren, when I come to you, came
not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto
you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know
anything among you, save Jesus Christ and Him crucified"&mdash;"And
my speech and my preaching was not with enticing
words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit
and of power" (1 Cor. ii:1-4).

And like the false prophets among Israel the false prophets
and teachers in Christendom are responsible for the deplorable[87]
conditions of the professing people of God. Instead
of sounding God's warning they cover up and lead the people
into the dark, where they are themselves. The responsibilities
of those men who deny the authority of the Bible,
who prophesy out of their own hearts is far greater than
any pen can describe.

And what else did the Lord say about them in Ezekiel's
message? "They have seen vanity and lying divination,
saying, The Lord saith, and the Lord hath not sent them."
Here is the root of the matter. The Lord never sent them;
He never called them into the office of a prophet or teacher.
They are self-called and self-sent. Being therefore not the
chosen instruments of the Lord, knowing not His Word nor
obeying His Spirit, they become the instruments of "lying
divination." Behind their messages of a false hope and
false peace stands the father of lies. 1 Kings xxii:19-23
throws important light upon this. It was a lying spirit who
possessed the false prophets in Ahab's times. Even so it
is predicted of the last days that the people will give heed to
seducing spirits and doctrines of demons (1 Tim. iv:1).

Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because ye have spoken
vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith
the Lord God. And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see
vanity and that divine lies; they shall not be in the assembly of my
people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house
of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye
shall know that I am the Lord God. Because, even because they
have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace;
and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered
mortar: Say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar,
that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye,
O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where
is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it. Therefore thus saith
the Lord God; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury;
and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great[88]
hailstone in my fury, to consume it. So will I break down the
wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it
down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered,
and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst
thereof, and ye shall know that I am the Lord. Thus will I accomplish
my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed
it with untempered mortar and will say unto you: The wall is no
more, neither they that daubed it; to wit the prophets of Israel
which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of
peace for them, and there is no peace saith the Lord God (verses
8-16).

And next the message pronounces the condemnation and
punishment of these false prophets. The Lord is against
them. His hand is to be upon them for punishment. Three
things are mentioned in which their punishment is going to
consist: they are to be excluded from the assembly of
God's people; they will be outcasts like lepers and such
they were; their names are not to be mentioned in the
writings of Israel; their memory will be blotted out, their
names forgotten; finally they were not to enter into the
land of Israel. This is not too severe if one thinks of the
souls these false prophets destroyed and the wicked work
they did, for it is wickedness to reject the Word of God and
substitute for it human inventions.

A more solemn word is pronounced in the New Testatment
against those who continue in Christendom the pernicious
and deceiving work of these false teachers. It is written,
"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;
for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are" (1 Cor.
iii:17). That is, believers constitute the temple of God,
that is, the church. The church has for its foundation the
Truth of God, the doctrine of Christ. A rejection of the
doctrine of Christ, so common in our day, defiles this spiritual
temple of God. It is the worst profanation. And the
false leader with his work corrupts the best, the holiest.[89]
"Him shall God destroy!" May God's people heed the warning
to have no fellowship with such who as hirelings do the
work of false prophets.

And these false prophets seduced the people. The delusion
consisted in saying, Peace, and there was no peace.
This is a characteristic of those who follow not God's revelation
but their own hearts. While God has threatened a
world which lieth in the wicked one, an age which is evil
and which never can be anything but evil, with judgments
to come, they preach peace and safety.

He describes them as building a wall and then putting some
untempered stuff, a whitewash, upon the wall. The wall
is for defence. They invented all kinds of schemes and
policies, political, religious and religious-political. This
was done to sustain their false messages and false hopes.
Then to hide the defects, they whitewashed their walls, they
glazed it over with nice and high sounding phrases. Such
is the case to-day. Oh! the schemes, the religious-political
combinations which are used to accomplish certain ends
which are nowhere authorized by the Word of God. And
the whitewash, the enticing, beautiful words which are used
to cover it over and make it appear as being secure! And
Ezekiel was commanded to say to these whitewashes, "It
shall fall!" A great storm with wind and flood would strike
it and the wall, the schemes and inventions of men were to
collapse (see Matt. vii:26-27). Even so the judgment came
upon Jerusalem and the land of Israel and swept away the
false prophets and what they had built up. Another judgment
will sweep over Christendom and sweep away the
"destructive critics," the false teachers and leaders of delusive
movements which flourish everywhere. Then the divine
mockery: "Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said
unto you, where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed
it?" (verse 12). When God fulfills His predictions written[90]
in the Word, when a boasting, Christless civilization, an
apostate church are engulfed in the judgment with which
this present age ends, where will be the nice sounding whitewash
of the false prophets?


II. The False Prophetesses.

Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of
thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy
thou against them, And say, Thus saith the Lord God; Woe to
the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make veils for the
head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my
people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you? And
will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for
pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the
souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that
hear your lies? Wherefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I
am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make
them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls
go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly. Your veils also
will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall
be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I
am the Lord. Because with lies ye have made the heart of the
righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the
hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked
way by promising him life: Therefore ye shall see no more vanity,
nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your
hand, and ye shall know that I am the Lord (verses 17-23).

And there were false women prophets among Israel likewise.
This is a significant fact. Women became religious
leaders and teachers in the days of Jerusalem's downfall
and the worst degradation followed upon that. They also
prophesied out of their own hearts and added other wicked
things to it. They sewed pillows upon all elbows and made
veils for the head to hunt for souls. This has been interpreted
in different ways. It means that they used amulets,
little idol images and other things by which they practised
the so-called divination&mdash;the soothsaying. It is sorcery to[91]
which these women prophets gave themselves up. The
veils which they used were to give to it a priestly air of
mysticism. They practised the sinister art of magic, or
as we call it nowadays, occultism. It was witchcraft,
this binding on of pillows and other things. This they
did for hire and to slay souls which should not be slain and
to sustain the wicked in their wickedness. Here is also undoubtedly
a hint about their wicked incantations, the spells
they claimed to cast that the innocent souls should die and
the guilty should live. But the Prophet declares now that
the Lord will deal with them, expose their wicked practises,
tear off their devices and deliver His people out of the snare.

All this is also done in the very midst of Christendom in
the twentieth century. Women prophets, the most subtle
instruments of Satan, are plentiful in these days. The fact
has often been pointed out that the prominent leaders in
the evil cults of the last days are women. There has been
a strange modern day revival of occult practices upon Christian
ground. Spiritualism, Theosophy and Christian Science
belong to this class. All three started with women.
Spiritualism with its mediums, fortune-tellers and necromancers
is almost entirely in the hands of women, who claim
to be religious leaders. The same is true of Theosophy,
with its Hindu philosophy and occultism, surrounded with
an air of unholy mysticism. Christian Science is closely
related to these two cults. Its founder practised for a
time the calling of a medium.

Significant is the description of the work of these false
prophets and prophetesses in verse 22: "Because with lies
ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have
not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked,
that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising
him life." The righteous in Israel were saddened by their
evil work. To the wicked they promised life, that there was[92]
no future punishment for their sins. Hence the wicked continued
in his wickedness.

And is the work of the false teachers, the false women-cults,
any different? The righteous are saddened. Each
one of the false teachers and movements like Spiritualism,
Theosophy, Russellism, Christian Science and others deny
the eternal punishment of the wicked. They strengthen the
hands of the wicked by promising him life.


THE MESSAGE AGAINST THE IDOLATROUS ELDERS.

Chapter xiv.

The elders now appear to inquire of the Lord through
the prophet (verse 3; xx:1). Though the prophet had
faithfully uttered the messages of judgment and impending
doom and the people and their leaders had heard them, yet
would they inquire of the Lord. The Word, the Lord had
sent to them, they rejected and now they expected some
new kind of a message. When these inquiring elders were
in the presence of Ezekiel, the Word of the Lord came unto
him. This chapter contains two sections; each is introduced
by the statement, "And the Word of the Lord came
unto me."


I. The Idolatrous Elder. The Call to Repentance.

Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before
me. And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the
stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired
of at all by them? Therefore speak unto them, and say
unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Every man of the house of
Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the
stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the
prophet; I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the
multitude of his idols; That I may take the house of Israel in their
own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their
idols. Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord[93]
God; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away
your faces from all your abominations. For every one of the house
of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth
himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and
putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and
cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the Lord
will answer him by myself. And I will set my face against that man,
and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off
from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing,
I the Lord have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my
hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people
Israel. And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity:
the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of
him that seeketh unto him; That the house of Israel may go no more
astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions;
but that they may be my people, and I may be their
God, saith the Lord God (verses 1-11).

These inquiring elders with wickedness in their hearts,
give another illustration of the depth of degradation in
which the people had sunken. He who searches the hearts
knew what was in them. They came with pious, religious
pretensions. It sounded well to inquire of the Lord and
seek the prophet-priest for that purpose. Their hearts
were full of evil. While their lips spoke of asking the Lord,
their hearts were full of idolatry. They liked idolatry.
Their hearts were in it and this stumbling-block of their
iniquity they had put before their faces, which means they
openly defied the Lord God of Israel by their doings. "Should
I be inquired of at all by them?" To seek the Lord and
inquire of Him in such a condition reveals a brazen spirit
and the deepest depravity. Yet this also belongs to the
conditions in which the professing people of God are when
judgment overtakes them. We see much of it in our own
days. There is a great deal of so-called religious exercise
and activity, attempts to produce more "religiousness," as it[94]
is termed. There is, however, no real heart-turning to the
Lord, but the idols are kept in heart and life. "If I regard
iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me" (Ps. lxvi:18).
Then the Lord tells them through the prophet, "I, the Lord,
will answer him that cometh according to the multitude
of their idols; that I may take the house of Israel in their
own heart because they are all estranged from me through
their idols." Estranged from Jehovah through idols; this
described the spiritual condition of these certain elders
and the people. If God's people do not give the Lord the
place of pre-eminence and follow Him wholly they become
estranged from Him. And such is the condition of thousands
of professing Christians who walk in a carnal way, who
follow their idols instead of the Lord and who still maintain
an outward religiousness. Then follows the call to repentance.
"Repent and turn yourselves from your idols."
Next is the announcement that the Lord Himself will deal
with such miserable hypocrites. He will answer the unrepenting,
idol follower, who separates himself from the Lord.
No true prophet of Jehovah would certainly encourage the
men who inquire of the Lord and have evil in their hearts,
for fellowship with Jehovah is impossible for such.

The ninth verse states more than a possibility. "And
if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing,
I, the Lord, have deceived the prophet, and I will stretch
out my hand upon him, and I will destroy him from the
midst of my people Israel." As we learned in the previous
prophetic message that such deceiving prophets were in
abundance among Israel. They were the curse of the
nation. Little did they care about the spiritual condition
of the people. They prophesied for filthy lucre's sake and
lived in sin like the rest of the apostates. To them people
came to inquire of the Lord and the deceiving prophets
prophesied smooth things. But the Lord Himself as a[95]
judgment had deceived their prophets to ripen the people
for the deserved doom. It is the same what Micaiah
declared in the presence of King Jehosaphat and King
Ahab (1 Kings xxii:13-23). The four hundred prophets of
Ahab were possessed by a lying spirit.


II. Judgment is Unavoidable.

The word of the Lord came again to me, saying, Son of man, when
the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I
stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread
thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast
from it: Though these three men, Noah, Daniel and Job, were in
it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness,
saith the Lord God. If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the
land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass
through because of the beasts: Though these three men were in it,
as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither sons nor
daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be
desolate. Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword,
go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God,
they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall
be delivered themselves. Or if I send a pestilence into that land,
and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and
beast: though Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, as I live, saith the
Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but
deliver their own souls by their righteousness. For thus saith the
Lord God; How much more when I send my fourscore judgments
upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast,
and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast? Yet, behold,
therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both
sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and
ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted
concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even
concerning all that I have brought upon it. And they shall see
their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done
without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord God
(verses 12-23).

The Word of the Lord came again to Ezekiel. The previously[96]
announced judgment cannot be averted, it is unavoidable;
this is the burden of the second message the
inquiring elders heard from the prophet's lips. Perhaps
this was on their minds when they came to the prophet
and sat in his presence. Famine is threatened first; it would
come upon man and beast. Then the noisome beasts
would pass through the land, to spoil it and make it desolate.
These beasts must not be understood in the literal sense;
they symbolize the Gentiles, whom Daniel in his vision
saw also as beasts (Dan. vii). These nations like the
Chaldeans would overrun the land and waste it. The last
two judgments were to be the sword (verse 17) and the
pestilence (verse 19). These four sore judgments were
about to fall upon Jerusalem and the land&mdash;famine, noisome
beasts, Gentile invasion, the sword and pestilence. Twice
in this address Noah, Daniel and Job are mentioned. They
were righteous men, yet if they were all three in Jerusalem
they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness,
which was the result of their faith in and obedience
to Jehovah. They were witnesses and men of prayer.
Noah, the witness before the great judgment by water
swept over the earth; Daniel even then in Babylon, and
Job of the patriarchal age. All their righteousness, and
all their witnessing and prayers would not help in preventing
these four sore judgments. Then there is a gracious promise
for the remnant which is to be preserved in these judgments.


THE PARABLE OF THE UNFRUITFUL VINE

Chapter xv.

The next three chapters contain divinely given parables.
The object of these parables is to expose still further the
false hopes which the people had during the reign of Zedekiah,
the last King of Judah. He rebelled against King
Nebuchadnezzar after the second invasion (2 Kings xxiv:20).[97]
He hoped, and the people with him, that deliverance would
come through the alliances Zedekiah had formed with Edom,
Ammon, Tyre and Sidon. He also had sent to Egypt for
help. "But he rebelled against him (the king of Babylon)
in sending ambassadors into Egypt that they might give
him horses and much people" (Ezek. xvii:15). In all this
Zedekiah and the remnant of people left in the land despised
the Word of Jehovah. Prophet after prophet had delivered
the same message concerning the ultimate and complete
overthrow of Jerusalem. During Josiah's reign in the
midst of the great reformation-revival, Hulda the prophetess,
had given the warning, "I will bring evil upon this place,
and upon the inhabitants thereof" (2 Kings xxii:16). The
great reformation could not keep back the decreed judgment.
Nor can any reformation movement in the close of our own
age avert the judgment which is predicted upon an ungodly
world and an apostate church. Josiah's reign was followed
by the reign of Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. It
went from bad to worse. Twice Nebuchadnezzar had come
and spoiled Jerusalem. It was evident that Jehovah's
judgment was being gradually executed upon the land and the
city. We have learned from the preceding chapters how
often and in how many different ways the Lord had repeated
through Ezekiel's visions and utterances that the judgment
would surely do its complete work, and that nothing would
be able to arrest it. Yet Zedekiah, in the awful blindness
characteristic of all who deliberately reject the Word of God
and continue in an impenitent state, hoped for better things.
And the exiles also shared more or less this false hope.

Three parables were therefore given to Ezekiel to demonstrate
still further the false and vain hope and the delusion
that there would be deliverance. The Parable of the unfruitful
vine shows that the nation was good for nothing,
and burning awaited the city. This is followed by a second[98]
parable, one of the most beautiful in the Word of God:
the parable of the abandoned child in the field. That child,
Jerusalem, had bestowed upon it all the mercy and grace
a loving God could give. And after all had been done she
became a wanton harlot and turned from Him who loved
her so much. Linked with the second parable is the restoration
promise, still unfulfilled. The third parable is the
parable of the great eagles. Here judgment upon the nation
is once more announced. And after that Ezekiel spoke
in Jehovah's name the final word: "As I live, saith the Lord
God, surely in the place where the king dwelleth (Nebuchadnezzar
in Babylon) that made him king (Zedekiah was
made king by Nebuchadnezzar), whose oath he despised
(Zedekiah had sworn to Nebuchadnezzar and then broke
the oath), even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall
die." "And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall
be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and
will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath
trespassed against me" (Ezek. xvii:16, 20).


I. The Parable of the Unfruitful Vine.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is
among the trees of the forest? Shall wood be taken thereof to do
any work, or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the
ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?
Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less
shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and
it is burned? Therefore, thus saith the Lord God; As the vine tree
among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel,
so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will set my face
against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall
devour them; and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I set my
face against them. And I will make the land desolate, because they
have committed a trespass, saith the Lord God (verses 1-8).[99]

The vine is a type of the people Israel. Perhaps their
confidence and boast was in the knowledge that they were
the vine of Jehovah. Their false prophets may have quoted
the words of Asaph in that beautiful prayer addressed to
the Shepherd of Israel: "Thou hast brought a vine out
of Egypt; thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it.
Thou preparedst room for it, and didst cause it to take
deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered
with the shadow of it and the boughs thereof were like the
goodly cedars. She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and
her branches unto the river. Why hast thou then broken
down her hedges, so that all they that pass by the way do
pluck her?" (Psalm lxxx:8-12). But they forgot that judgment
had been long ago pronounced against the vine and
the vineyard of Israel. Isaiah has spoken of the vineyard
and what Jehovah had done for His people. But the vine
brought forth wild grapes. "And now go to; I will tell
you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away the
hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and will break down
the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And I
will lay it waste. It shall not be pruned or digged; but
there shall come up briers and thorns; I will also command
the clouds that they rain not upon it" (Isaiah v:1-6). And
Hosea, too, had borne witness against the vine: "Israel is
an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself; according
to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars;
according to the goodness of the land they have made goodly
images" (Hosea x:1).

Their boast of being the vine and vineyard of Jehovah
was an idle one. Ezekiel's parable demonstrates this. The
vine tree is only good for one thing and that is the bearing of
fruit. Apart from fruit bearing the vine is worthless. The
wood of it cannot be used for anything whatever. Is it
meet for any work? Will men take a piece of it and hang a[100]
vessel thereon? It is good for nothing else but to be burned
with fire. Cast into the fire for fuel it is burned at both
ends and in the midst. This was to be the certain fate of
Jerusalem. The process of the fiery judgment consuming
the unfruitful vine tree had already begun. "And I will
set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire
and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that
I am the Lord, when I set my face against them." Even
so it came upon the city when Nebuchadnezzar came against
Jerusalem the third time. "And he burnt the house of
the Lord, and the King's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem,
and every great man's house burnt he with fire"
(2 Kings xxv:9). And here we must also remember the
statement our Lord made in the parable of the vine and
the branches. "If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth
as a branch, and is withered, and men gather them, and
cast them into the fire, and they are burned" (John xv:6).
Some apply this also to Israel. It means, however, the
professing believer, who in an empty profession claims to
be a branch in Him who is the true vine. Such a one is a
barren branch, good only for burning.

Our Lord's parable of the vineyard (Matt. xxi:33, etc.)
must here likewise be considered. It brings together all
the prophets had spoken concerning Israel as the vineyard,
as well as the crowning sin of the people, in the rejection
and death of the Lord Jesus, and the judgment
which came upon Jerusalem and the nation.

But there is a day coming when the Lord will graciously
visit the vine again, when He will have mercy upon Zion.
Of this the already quoted eightieth Psalm bears a blessed
testimony.

The prayer of the godly remnant of the Jewish people at
the close of the times of the Gentiles is pre-written in that
Psalm by the Holy Spirit. Let us listen to it. "Return[101]
we beseech thee, O God of hosts; look down from heaven,
and behold, and visit this vine and the vineyard which
thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou
madest strong for thyself. It is burned with fire, it is cut
down; they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. Let
thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand (the Lord
Jesus Christ), upon the son of man, whom thou madest
strong for thyself. So will we not go back from thee;
quicken us, and we will call upon thy name" (Psalm lxxx:14-18).


THE PARABLE OF THE ABANDONED CHILD. JERUSALEM'S
IDOLATRY. THE PROMISES OF
RESTORATION.

Chapter xvi.

After the parable of the unfruitful vine in which the vain
hope and boast of Jerusalem is briefly exposed, another
parable was uttered by the Prophet, which more fully establishes
Jerusalem's great wickedness. The chapter before
us is one of the greatest in the prophetic Scriptures. It
contains a wonderful history of Jerusalem, past, present and
future, and God's dealings with her.

We give first a brief survey of this interesting chapter
before we take up a more analytical study. The parable
of the abandoned child and Jehovah's love and mercy in
taking her up, saving the perishing one from death and
bestowing upon her such gracious labor and gifts, forms the
first part of the chapter (verse 1-14). It is a most beautiful
description of what Jehovah had done for Jerusalem.
After this, the terrible ingratitude and fall of Jerusalem is
uncovered. She, whom Jehovah lifted so high, upon whom
He bestowed such love and grace, turned against Jehovah
and became an abandoned prostitute. The idolatries of
Jerusalem and corresponding moral degradations are vividly[102]
pictured in this second section of the chapter (verses 15-34).
Then follows the announcement of the doom of Jerusalem.
In this third section Samaria and her daughters,
as well as Sodom and her daughters are introduced, and
their return to the former estate with Jerusalem is announced.

These restoration promises are frequently used by teachers
of the so-called "larger hope," who deny the eternal
punishment of the wicked. It is claimed that Sodom and
her daughters, all the inhabitants of wicked Sodom, who
perished in the great judgment, will be raised from the dead
and have another chance. We shall, in considering this
portion of the chapter (verses 35-59), show the unscripturalness
of this theory as well as the true meaning of the promise.
The fourth section (verses 59-63) promises the establishment
of Jehovah's covenant with Jerusalem.


I. The Parable of the Abandoned Child.

Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, and say, Thus saith the
Lord God unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the
land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an
Hittite. And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy
navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple
thee; thou was not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. None eye
pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon
thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the loathing of thy
person, in the day that thou wast born. And when I passed by
thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee
when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou
wast in thy blood, Live. I have caused thee to multiply as the bud
of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art
come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine
hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare. Now when I
passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the
time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy
nakedness; yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant
with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine. Then[103]
washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy
blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil. I clothed thee also
with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I
girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.
I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy
hands, and a chain on thy neck. And I put a jewel on thy forehead,
and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine
head. Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy
raiment was of fine linen and silk and broidered work; thou didst
eat fine flour, and honey and oil; and thou wast exceeding beautiful,
and thou didst prosper into a kingdom. And thy renown went
forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through
my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God
(verses 1-14).

In the beginning of the chapter the purpose of the parable
is stated. "Son of Man, cause Jerusalem to know her
abominations." To convict Jerusalem of all her guilt and
wickedness the Lord shows first of all what He had done
for her. While Jerusalem is specially mentioned, the parable
has a wider application to the nation itself. The different
dealings of the Lord with His people can be traced
in this beautiful parable. First, Jerusalem's origin is mentioned.
"Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of
Canaan; thy father was an Amorite and thy mother a Hittite."
This does not mean Abraham and Sarah, from which
the nation sprang, but it refers to the origin of the city
itself, which was Canaanitish. The Amorites were the
original possessors of Palestine, as we learn from Genesis
xv:16. The name for Palestine in the cuneiform inscriptions
is "Land of the Amorites." The Hittites are also
mentioned in Genesis as the inhabitants of the land. (Genesis
xxiii:3, 10; xxvii:46). Thus Jerusalem is described as
coming from a base and unclean parentage. The Lord had
mercy on her whose condition was like an abandoned child
cast out into an open field. He passed by and spoke the
word, which He alone could speak&mdash;Live! Then He began[104]
His work of mercy. He caused her to multiply as the bud
of the field. He made her to increase. He entered into a
covenant with her. "Yea, I swear unto thee, and entered
into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou
becamest mine." Furthermore we read, "I washed thee
with water"; "I anointed thee with oil"; "I clothed"; "I
girded thee"; "I covered thee with silk." Ornaments
were bestowed upon the beloved one. Bracelets upon the
hands; a chain for the neck; a jewel for the forehead; earrings
for the ears; decked with gold and silver; arrayed
in fine linen and silk and broidered work, feeding on fine
flour, honey and oil&mdash;such were Jehovah's gifts to Jerusalem.
A beautiful crown was put upon her head. Jerusalem
became exceedingly beautiful and prospered into a
kingdom. Her renown went forth among the nations on
account of her beauty. All this is a striking allegory of
Jehovah's mercy to Jerusalem, and the culmination refers
to the days of the glorious kingdom under Solomon. There
is no need of applying every statement to some historical
fact in the history of Jerusalem as it has been attempted
by certain expositors. The purpose, as already stated, is
to convict Jerusalem of her abominations, and for this
reason Jehovah's goodness to her is so vividly described.
Jehovah had done all for her and not a word is said about
gratitude or love from the side of Jerusalem. All was done
for her by Him. "It was perfect through my comeliness
(magnificence), which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord
God."

And this sweet parable illustrates, as few other portions
in the Old Testament do, the grace which the Lord bestows
upon the believer in the Gospel. Thy father an Amorite
and thy mother a Hittite reminds us of what is true of all
men, so tersely expressed in David's confession, "Behold
I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive[105]
me" (Psalm li:5). Like the child pictured in the parable,
we are lost, perishing in the field (the world). What could
that perishing child do to save itself? Even so we cannot
do anything to save ourselves. The Lord passing by had
compassion and spoke His Word of power&mdash;Live. He came
from Heaven to this earth, into the field to seek and save
what is lost. He found man in the vile and helpless condition
so aptly pictured by the miserable child. And more
than that, He died to save man. He gave His life so that
we might live. The first thing He does for the believing
sinner is to give him life. When the spiritual dead hear
His voice they live. The washing with water, the anointing
with oil (type of the Holy Spirit), the announcement "thou
becamest mine," as well as the clothing, the beautifying and
the crowning, all illustrates what His marvelous grace does
for the trusting, believing sinner. It is all grace from start
to finish, from the impartation of life in the new birth to
the crowning in glory.


II. Jerusalem's Idolatries and Moral Degradation.

But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot
because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every
one that passed by; his it was. And of thy garments thou didst
take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colors, and playedst
the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall
it be so. Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men,
and didst commit whoredom with them. And tookest thy broidered
garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil
and mine incense before them. My meat also which I gave thee,
fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast
even set it before them for a sweet savor: and thus it was, saith
the Lord God. Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy
daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou
sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms
a small matter. That thou has slain my children, and delivered
them to cause them to pass through the fire for them? And in all[106]
thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered
the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast
polluted in thy blood. And it came to pass after all thy wickedness,
(woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord God,) That thou hast also
built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee a high
place in every street. Thou hast built thy high place at every head
of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast
opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy
whoredoms. Thou hast also committed fornication with the
Egyptians thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast increased thy
whoredoms, to provoke me to anger. Behold, therefore, I have
stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine
ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate
thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy
lewd way. Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians,
because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot
with them, and couldest not be satisfied. Thou hast moreover
multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea;
and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith. How weak is thine
heart, saith the Lord God, seeing thou doest all these things,
the work of an imperious whorish woman; in that thou buildest
thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine
high place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot, in that
thou scornest hire; but as a wife that committeth adultery, which
taketh strangers instead of her husband! They give gifts to all
whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest
them, that they may come unto thee on every side of thy whoredom.
And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,
whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in
that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore
thou art contrary (verses 15-34).

Upon the beautiful background of Jehovah's love and
mercy, there is now written the dark picture of Jerusalem's
whoredoms, symbolical of her wicked idolatries. "But thou
didst trust in thine own beauty, and played the harlot
because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications
on every one that passed by; his it was" (verse 15). It
started all with pride. Jerusalem did not acknowledge the
giver, who had made her great. Instead of worshipping[107]
in Jehovah's appointed way, they established the "high
places" and conformed to all the wicked Canaanitish practices.
The wickedness of the Amorites and Hittites, from
which she came, were reproduced in her. Their little ones
were given to Moloch as a sacrifice. "Moreover thou hast
taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne
unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be
devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, that
thou hast slain thy children, and delivered them to pass
through the fire for them?" (verses 20-21). From the
Second Book of Kings we learn that Ahaz was the first
king who committed this atrocity. "He made his son pass
through the fire, according to the abominations of the
heathen whom the Lord cast out from before the children
of Israel" (2 Kings xvi:3). And Manasseh, the wicked
son of a pious father, also followed the same horrible practice
(2 Kings xxi:6). The historical books of Second Kings
and Second Chronicles must be read to understand more
fully the symbolical language used by Ezekiel and to learn
the idolatry and degradation of Jerusalem. All Jehovah
had given and bestowed upon her was devoted to practice
this spiritual fornication. What Jehovah had done for
her was forgotten.

"And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou
hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou
wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood" (verse
22). But worse than that followed. Not enough that
Jerusalem had her high places and revived the practices of
the Canaanitish natives, she began to have also idolatrous
intercourse with the idol-gods of Egypt, Assyria and Chaldea
(verses 23-34). She sought them out and courted them
all to increase her harlotry. So great became Jerusalem's
abominations that the daughters of the Philistines became
ashamed of her lewd way (verse 27). And while such was[108]
the religious degradation of Jerusalem in following the basest
and most corrupt idolatries, a corresponding moral
degradation was linked with it. All the rites of the Canaanites
and the other nations consisted in the grossest immoralities.
The most shameless and the vilest things of the
flesh were practiced in the midst of the idolatrous city.
"How is the faithful city become a harlot!" (Isaiah i:21).
In the next section the Lord addresses her by that title
and once more her judgment doom is announced. "Wherefore,
O harlot, hear the word of the Lord" (verse 35).

The spiritual adultery which characterizes the end of the
present age is even greater than that of Jerusalem. The
apostacy of Jerusalem is overshadowed by the rising tide
of an approaching, final apostasy in which Satan's man and
masterpiece will demand and receive the worship which
belongs to the Lord. Antichrist, yet to come, his shadow
cast so sharply in our days, will be the consummation of the
greatest departure from God and defiance of God the world
has ever seen. And therefore the coming judgment will
also be greater.

After the beautiful parable of the abandoned child, from
which we learned Jehovah's grace and mercy shown to
Jerusalem, and the description of Jerusalem's idolatries and
moral degradation, we find her judgment doom announced
once more. In connection with this the prophet beholds
the time when Sodom and her daughters and Samaria and
her daughters, as well as Jerusalem and her daughters, will
return to their former estate.


III. The Doom of Jerusalem on account of Her Wickedness.

Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord: Thus saith the
Lord God; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness
discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with
all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children,[109]
which thou didst give unto them; Behold, therefore I will gather all
thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them
that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will
even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy
nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. And
I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are
judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy. And I
will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine
eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall
strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and
leave thee naked and bare. They shall also bring up a company
against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee
through with their swords. And they shall burn thine houses with
fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women:
and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou
also shalt give no hire any more. So will I make my fury toward
thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be
quiet, and will be no more angry. Because thou hast not remembered
the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things;
behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head,
saith the Lord God: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above
all thine abominations.

Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter. Thou
art thy mother's daughter, that loatheth her husband and her
children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which loathed their
husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your
father an Amorite. And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her
daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that
dwelleth at thy right hand is Sodom and her daughters. Yet hast
thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations:
but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more
than they in all thy ways. As I live, saith the Lord God, Sodom
thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done,
thou and thy daughters. Behold, this was the iniquity of thy
sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness
was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand
of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed
abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.
Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified[110]
thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done. Thou
also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy
sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they
are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and
bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters. When I
shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her
daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then
will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:
That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded
in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.
When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their
former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their
former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your
former estate. For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy
mouth in the day of thy pride. Before thy wickedness was discovered,
as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria,
and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines,
which despise thee round about. Thou hast borne thy lewdness
and thine abominations, saith the Lord. For thus saith the Lord
God; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised
the oath in breaking the covenant (verses 35-59).

The Word of the Lord is now addressed not to the beloved
city, but to the harlot. She had committed the most awful
spiritual fornication, with which she had insulted Jehovah,
and utterly rejected His love and mercy. All the idols
of abominations were found in her. The different nations
which surrounded the land were given to the most degrading
idolatries, and Jerusalem had not alone taken up this
wicked idol worship, but she became worse than the heathen
which practised these things. "They did after the abominations
of the heathen which the Lord had cast out before
the children of Israel" (2 Kings xxi:2). Graven images
were set up in Jerusalem. Moloch service (sacrifice of children)
became general. Sorceries and demon-cults flourished.
The vilest immoralities were linked with all this
false worship. Jerusalem had become a harlot in the fullest
sense of the word, a sink of iniquity. And her lovers,[111]
the nations, whose idolatries she had accepted, would now
be gathered against her to be used in her judgment (verse
37). Her judgment would be "as a woman that breaks wedlock,"
that is, an adulteress&mdash;"and I will give thy blood in
fury and jealousy" (verse 38). Stoning was the judgment
for a woman who committed adultery (Lev. xx:10; John
viii:5). Therefore the Lord said, "They shall also bring
up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with
stones and thrust thee through with their swords" (verse
40). The judgment would be exhaustive upon her and she
would be caused to cease playing the harlot&mdash;"thou shalt
also give no hire any more" (verse 41). Without following
the description of her doom and Jehovah's scathing condemnation
in detail, we turn to that which is of much
importance and interest. Samaria is mentioned and her
daughters as the elder sister of Jerusalem, and Sodom and
her daughters as her younger sister (verse 46). And
though the corruption of Samaria and Sodom were so
great, yet Jerusalem "was corrupted more than they" in
all her ways. "As I live, saith the Lord God, Sodom thy
sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast
done, thou and thy daughters" (verse 48). Samaria is
called the elder sister, because the northern kingdom
was the larger; and Sodom is called the younger, because
her territory was smaller. The daughters mentioned in
connection with each has reference to the allied towns of
Jerusalem, Samaria and the region south of Jerusalem,
where Sodom was the chief city. Then Sodom's sin is
mentioned. Pride stands first (verse 49); luxurious living,
and then followed abomination, and God took them away.
After the sins of Samaria are briefly rehearsed we find in
this chapter the following words: "When I shall bring again
their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters,
and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will[112]
I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of
them" (verse 53). And again we read: "When thy sisters,
Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former
estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their
former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to
your former estate" (verse 55). These two statements
are used by a certain class of teachers to back up their
unscriptural theory of a future restitution of the wicked
dead. They say that these two passages predict a restoration
of Sodom and the other wicked cities which perished
in judgment by fire (Gen. xix), and also a restoration of
Samaria as well as Jerusalem, and upon this they built their
hope that all the wicked dead will be raised up and restored to
a place of blessing. They make therefore much of a restoration
of the wicked dead by resurrection.[13] Besides these two
passages they also use the following Old Testament scriptures
to confirm their theory: Eze. xxxvii:1-14; Hosea
xiii:14; Jere. xlviii:47; Is. xxv:7-8, and others. These
passages are applied by these teachers to a restitution of
the wicked dead by resurrection. But this is the wrong
interpretation. They have nothing to do with the resurrection
of the physical dead. They refer to national resurrection
and restoration. Three facts will show the error
of making the Old Testament teach the restoration of the
wicked dead:

I. The Old Testament is not that part of the divine Revelation
where teachings and doctrines about the future state
are given.

This is a most important fact. The Old Testament
shows man as upon the earth, on this side of death, and
not beyond death. The future of Israel on the earth, their[113]
supremacy and destiny of glory amidst the nations of the
earth, the judgments of God in the earth, as well as the
future blessings for the nations inhabiting the earth during
the coming age, are all clearly revealed in the Old
Testament. The state after death, that which is beyond
this life, is shrouded in mystery in the Old Testament
Scriptures. That great judgment, the great white throne
judgment, is nowhere mentioned in the Old Testament,
nor do we read a word there of "the second death." Resurrection
of the dead, no doubt, was known to individual
saints of Old Testament times; the Spirit of God revealed
it to their hearts, but as a doctrine, resurrection is not found
in the Old Testament. In Psalm xvi is revealed the hope
of resurrection of the body, and there is a prophecy of
the resurrection of our Lord.

II. Should we find anything in the Old Testament concerning
the future state, the state of the righteous and the unrighteous
after death, such a hint or statement can only be
rightly understood and interpreted by the great doctrine concerning
the future state as revealed in the New Testament.

By this, of course, we do not say that the Old Testament
needs correction by the revelation of the New, nor do we
say that the Old is inferior to the New; all is the Word of
God. However, as the Old Testament does not show man's
condition after death, any passage which appears to relate
to such a condition must be interpreted by the full light as
given in the New Testament.

III. If such passages as Ezekiel xvi:53 and Ezekiel
xxxvii:1-14, etc., teach the restitution of the wicked by resurrection
for another chance, we must then find such a doctrine of the
restoration of the wicked dead for another chance to accept
salvation most clearly and fully revealed as one of the great
doctrines of the New Testament.

In vain, however, do we look in the New Testament for[114]
such a restoration&mdash;second probation doctrine. Such a doctrine
is not even hinted at in the New. However, the New
Testament gives the fullest revelation concerning resurrection
and the future state. It tells us that there is indeed
a resurrection of the body for every human being. This
revelation of resurrection as contained in the New Testament
leaves no room whatever for the Sodomites and all
the wicked idolatrous Israelites, to be raised up for another
chance. Our Lord in John v:29 reveals a two-fold resurrection,
a resurrection unto life and a resurrection unto
damnation. The human race, those who have died, are
therefore in resurrection divided into two classes: they
must come forth either unto life or unto damnation; there
is no middle class. Later the New Testament teaches a
first resurrection, an out resurrection from the dead. Only
those who have believed and died in Christ will have a share
in this resurrection. Both Old and New Testament saints
belong to it, but none have a part in it who died in their sins.
The rest of the dead, meaning of course, the wicked dead, are
not raised up till after the thousand years. This is a second
resurrection and this takes place not when the Lord comes the
second time, but after His millennial reign (Rev. xx). The
subjects of this second resurrection appear before the great
white throne and are cast into the lake of fire. Now, these
teachers claim that the return of Sodom and Samaria to
their former estate means their resurrection for another
chance when the Lord comes. But as these departed
wicked people are wicked still, how can they have part in
the first resurrection when the Lord comes, which is the
resurrection of the righteous?

They surely cannot belong to this resurrection. And
there is nowhere in the New Testament a word about
another special resurrection in which all the wicked are
raised from dead for another chance. After the resurrection[115]
of the righteous dead there is but one more resurrection,
the resurrection of the wicked unto damnation. In the
light of these facts the flimsy theory built upon misapplied
texts of the Old Testament, texts which relate to national
restoration and blessing, breaks down completely. And now
having seen what the statements in this chapter of Ezekiel
do not mean, let us see what is their meaning. While these
statements cannot mean the resurrection of individuals,
they mean a national restoration. There is promised in
many passages of the Old Testament a national restoration
of Israel. The ten tribes are to be brought back to their
former possessions. Historically they have been lost.[14]
But they are not lost to God. He knows where they are.
He has kept track of them, and in His own time He will
make good the promises of their restoration and will bring
back the remnants of the house of Israel, now scattered
still among the nations. The Jews will also be restored to
their territory. Repeatedly this national restoration of
the ancient people is promised under the picture of a resurrection.
But to other nations there is also promised such
a national restoration in the days to come, when the Lord
comes and begins His Kingdom reign over the earth. Such
a national revival is beyond a doubt promised for a future
day to Moab, Ammon, Assyria and Egypt. Edom and
Babylon, however, are doomed as nations and no revival
whatever is promised to them.

We do not know of course how God will accomplish these
promises of restoration and national revivals, and how He
will gather the remnants of these former nations from the
great sea of nations. We can leave this and other difficulties
with Him who will see to the fulfillment of all these things.

[116]And so there is promised not alone a return of Samaria to
her former estate, but also to Sodom and the cities which
were wiped out by judgment. Here is the difficulty which
is used to prove that a literal resurrection of the wicked
Sodomites must be meant. Were they not all totally
destroyed? How then can there be a national restoration
when they all perished? But while it is true that all who
were in Sodom and the other cities perished, we do not
know how many of the inhabitants of these prosperous
cities, thickly populated, no doubt, happened to be away
from home, on journeys or outside of the doomed district,
and thus escaped the fate of others. God knows all this
and keeps track of all. There is certainly promised a healing
for the territory occupied by Sodom and her sister cities.
The vision of the stream issuing from the temple (Ex. xlvii)
is seen emptying into the sea, which is the Dead Sea, "and
the waters shall be healed and everything shall live whithersoever
the river cometh." See also Zechariah xiv:8. And
what else it may mean we do not know. But of one thing
we can be assured, it does not mean the resurrection of
the wicked Sodomites for a second chance, for we know that
they are "suffering the vengeance of eternal fire" (Jude 7).


IV. The Covenant Remembered and Established.

The closing paragraph of this interesting chapter is the
divine assurance that the covenant made in the days of
Israel's youth is to be remembered.

Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days
of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou
shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give
them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. And I will
establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am
the Lord; that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and
never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am
pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord
God (verses 60-63).[117]

The covenant will be remembered and established as an
everlasting covenant. Then Jerusalem will receive the elder
and younger sister, Samaria and Sodom, not as sisters,
but as daughters. They will be added in the coming days
of blessing to Jerusalem. This, however, will not be done
"by thy covenant," which means the law covenant but by
"His covenant," the covenant of promise and of grace
(xvi:8). "And I will establish my covenant with thee,
and thou shalt know that I am the Lord." Of this great
restoration and blessing in store for Jerusalem we shall hear
much in the closing visions of Ezekiel.


THE PARABLE OF THE TWO EAGLES. THE CEDAR
AND THE VINE.

Chapter xvii.

The Prophet is once more commanded to speak in a
parable to the house of Israel. In this parable there is again
portrayed the sin of Jerusalem, and the treacherous character
of corrupt Zedekiah. Like the sixteenth chapter
it ends with another restoration promise, which will find its
future fulfilment when God in sovereign grace exalts the
branch of David. This will take place when Messiah will
be King and rules in righteousness.


I. The Parable of the Two Eagles.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, put
forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel: And
say, Thus saith the Lord God; A great eagle with great wings, long-winged,
full of feathers, which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon,
and took the highest branch of the cedar: He cropped off
the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick;
he set it in a city of merchants. He took also of the seed of the land,
and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and
set it as a willow tree. And it grew, and became a spreading vine
of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots[118]
thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth
branches, and shot forth sprigs. There was also another great
eagle with great wings and many feathers: and behold, this vine
did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward
him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring
forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a
goodly vine. Say thou, Thus saith the Lord God; Shall it prosper?
shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof,
that it wither? It shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even
without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots
thereof. Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not
utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? It shall wither in
the furrows where it grew (verses 1-10).

The great eagle mentioned first is Nebuchadnezzar, the
King of Babylon. "For thus saith the Lord: Behold he
shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab"
(Jer. xlviii:40). "Behold, he shall come up and fly as the
eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah" (Jer. xlix:22).
When Daniel saw the Babylonian Empire rising out of the
sea it was in the form of a lion with eagle's wings (Daniel
vii:1-2). Nebuchadnezzar had been constituted by God
the first great monarch of the times of the Gentiles after the
complete apostasy of Israel. Thus Jeremiah had announced it
(Jer. xxvii:5, etc.), and Daniel also told the King, "Thou, O
King, art a King of Kings, for the God of heaven hath given
thee a Kingdom, power, and strength and glory" (Dan.
ii:37). Ezekiel's parable describes him as a great eagle with
great wings and long-winged, denoting his great power and
the vast dominion which belonged to him. "Full of feathers"
pictures the multitude of his subjects and the "divers
colors" the different nations of his empire.

This eagle, Nebuchadnezzar, came to Lebanon and took
the highest branch of the cedar. He cropped off the top of
his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set
it in a city of merchants. The cedar of Lebanon is the[119]
symbol of the royal house of David, which was conquered
by the eagle. The top of his young twigs, whom Nebuchadnezzar
cropped off and carried into the city of merchants,
Babylon, describes Jehoiakim and his captivity (2 Kings
xxiv:1-5) (2 Chron. xxxvi:6-7). Then Nebuchadnezzar
made Mattaniah, the youngest son of Josiah, King over
Judah, and changed his name to Zedekiah. This action
of the King of Babylon is described in verse 5. And Zedekiah
might have done well if he had held to the King who had set
him into the place of authority. He was placed like a willow
tree beside great waters, so that he became a spreading
vine of low stature; his roots were under him, which means,
he was dependent upon Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings xxiv:17).
The other great eagle, whom Ezekiel mentions in his parable,
is Hophra, the King of Egypt. To this king Zedekiah
turned for help: "This vine bent her roots towards him."
Zedekiah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. Verse 8 describes
the opportunity which had been given to Zedekiah
and verses 9-10 announces his judgment. The sin and
treacherous dealings of Zedekiah is shown in the next verses.


II. The Interpretation and Application of the Parable.

Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Say now
to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell
them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath
taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with
him to Babylon; and hath taken of the king's seed, and made a
covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also
taken the mighty of the land. That the kingdom might be base,
that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant
it might stand. But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors
into Egypt, "that they might give him horses and much
people. "Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things?
or shall he break the covenant and be delivered? As I live, saith
the Lord God, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that
made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he
brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. Neither[120]
shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for
him in the war, by casting up mounts and building forts, to cut off
many persons. Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant,
when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these
things he shall not escape. Therefore, thus saith the Lord God;
As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant
that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.
And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my
snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him
there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me. And
all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they
that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know
that I the Lord have spoken it (verses 11-21).

We have next the divine interpretation and application of
this parable. After the statement that the great eagle, the
King of Babylon, had come to Jerusalem and taken the King
and the princes captive, Zedekiah is mentioned. Nebuchadnezzar
had made him King and had made a covenant with him
and had taken an oath of him. Nebuchadnezzar had made
him swear by God (2 Chron. xxxvi:13). Nebuchadnezzar
had entered into a solemn covenant with Zedekiah and the
name of God was used to make that covenant binding.
Then Zedekiah, who had less regard for the name of God
than Nebuchadnezzar, rebelled. Ambassadors from Edom,
Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon, came to Jerusalem to see
King Zedekiah (Jere. xxvii:1-2). A combined revolution was
evidently contemplated. He also sent ambassadors to Egypt.
He expected great help from Pharaoh, who was a grandson
of Necho, named Hophra. He advanced through Phoenicia
and obliged the Chaldean army to abandon the siege of
Jerusalem (Jere. xxxvii: 5-7). The joy over this event in
Jerusalem was great, for the wicked, treacherous King
Zedekiah expected that the Egyptian army would be the
deliverer. But the relief was of a short duration. The
Egyptian army had to retire and the Chaldeans resumed
the siege. His great sin was that he had despised the oath[121]
and broken the covenant. Ezekiel announced therefore in
the name of Jehovah his coming doom. "Therefore thus
saith the Lord God; as I live, surely mine oath that he hath
despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will
I recompense upon his own head. And I will spread my net
upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring
him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass
that he hath trespassed against me." He tried to escape
from Jerusalem, but he and his household were taken captives
and carried to the headquarters of Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah.
Zedekiah was arraigned and sentenced. His daughters were
set free, while his sons were slain before him. This was the
last thing the oath-despising, covenant-breaking Zedekiah
saw. His eyes were put out and he was bound with double
fetters of brass and carried to Babylon, where he died a
prisoner (Jere. lii:11). He had despised the name of
Jehovah and brought dishonor upon the name by violating
the covenant with Nebuchadnezzar. The Gentile King
had a higher esteem of that Name than the Jewish King.
And then Jehovah in His righteous dealings used the Gentile
to mete out the well-deserved retribution upon Zedekiah.
Thus the Gentile King was used in punishing a faithless Jew.
It foreshadows the judgment which came upon the whole
nation when they despised and rejected more than a covenant.
Ever since they rejected their own Messiah and King,
the Lord Jesus Christ, the Gentiles have trodden down
Jerusalem and the nation is blinded.


III. The Promise of the Future.

Thus saith the Lord God; I will also take of the highest branch
of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his
young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain
and eminent: In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant
it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly
cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow[122]
of the branches thereof shall they dwell. And all the trees of the
field shall know that I, the Lord, have brought down the high tree,
have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have
made the dry tree to flourish: I the Lord have spoken and have
done it (verses 22-24).

And now once more Israel's hope and Israel's future
comes into view. The allegory of the parable is continued.
The cedar is the royal house of David. God in His Sovereignty
promises to take "of its young shoots a tender one and
I will plant it upon a high and eminent mountain." This
tender one is the Messiah, the Son of David. It is the same
promise as given in the Prophet Isaiah. "And there shall
come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall
grow out of his roots" (Is. xi:1). "For He shall grow up
before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry
ground" (Is. liii:2). The high and eminent mountain
typifies Mount Zion and the Kingdom of Messiah is pictured
in the closing verses of the chapter. The high tree which is
brought low, the green tree which is dried up is the symbol
of Gentile world-power. The low tree which is exalted
and the dry tree which is made to flourish stands for the
restoration of the Kingdom to Israel when the Son of David,
our Lord, comes again. Then the high tree will be cut down
and the now flourishing Gentile dominion will dry up;
Israel the low tree will be exalted and the long, dry and
barren nation will bring its blessed fruit.


GOD'S JUDGMENTS ARE RIGHTEOUS.

Chapter xviii.

Again the Word of the Lord came unto the Prophet. The
contents of this chapter are, therefore, not "the reasonings
and expostulations of Ezekiel," but another great
message to the stubborn nation, which constantly tried
to justify itself. Judgments heavy and severe had come[123]
upon them. Instead of bowing under them and confessing
their guilt and the justice of all these punitive dealings
of a righteous God, they accused Him of injustice, as if
He were punishing them, not for their own sins, but for the
sins of their fathers. They said, "the way of the Lord is
not equal"; and the Lord proves to them that His way is
equal, but their way is unequal (verse 25). It is a great
and interesting controversy, ending with the sublime declaration
and appeal, "I have no pleasure in the death of
him that dieth, saith the Lord God, wherefore turn yourselves
and live."


I. The False Accusation and the Divine Answer.

The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying. What mean
ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying,
The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are
set on edge. As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have
occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel. Behold, all souls
are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is
mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die (verses 1-4).

The same proverb, "the fathers have eaten sour grapes,
and the children's teeth are set on edge" is also mentioned
by the Prophet Jeremiah. "In those days they shall say
no more, the fathers have eaten a sour grape, his teeth shall
be set on edge" (Jer. xxxi:29). And Jeremiah adds in a
brief sentence what is more fully given through Ezekiel:
"But every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man
that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge."
What they meant by this proverb is that their forefathers
had committed sin and now they were bearing the results of
their iniquities, while they, the children, were innocent.
"Our fathers have sinned and are not; and we have borne
their iniquities" (Lam. v:7). This was a false and unjust
accusation. No doubt they rested their proverb upon
Exodus xx:5 and xxxiv:7. But doing this they denied[124]
their own guilt and refused to repent and be converted.
And now the Lord answers the proverb to show its injustice
so that it should no more be used in Israel: "Behold all
souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul
of the son is mine; the soul that sinneth it shall die." He
will judge the individual, father or son, according to conduct.
All belong to Him, which means, He is the Creator of all
and He will deal with each individually. If the sins of the
fathers come upon the children, it is because the children
follow the wickedness of the fathers. "Every man shall be
put to death for his own sin" (Deut. xxiv:16). The person
that sins shall die for his own sins. "The soul that sinneth
it shall die."


II. The Conditions of Life.

But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right. And
hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes
to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbor's
wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her separation. And
hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge,
hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry,
and hath covered the naked with a garment: He that hath not given
forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn
his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between
man and man. Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my
judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the
Lord God (verses 5-9).

This paragraph and the next two begin with an "if."
They are, therefore, supposed cases "if a man be just." It
shows what God requires as the conditions for life. However,
it must be understood that the promise of life, "he shall
surely live," has nothing whatever to do with eternal life.
This is not at all in view in these paragraphs. It is the
natural life. Eternal life was never promised to be bestowed
upon man as the result of doing what is lawful and
right. Neither righteousness nor eternal life can come by[125]
the works of the law. Here negatively and positively God's
demands are stated. In the sixth verse false worship is in
view. Eating upon the mountains, the high places, was
the false worship; the idols of the house of Israel were the
calves which Jeroboam had set up (1 Kings xii:25-33). This
demand for true worship covers the first part of the decalogue,
"Thou shalt have no other gods besides Me." With
this spiritual fornication, an idolatrous worship, there
was connected the grossest lusts of the flesh. These are
mentioned here as well as sins against the neighbor. Thus
the commandments in the second part of the decalogue are
made prominent. "Thou shalt not kill," "Thou shalt not
commit adultery," "Thou shalt not steal." This is followed
by the divine demand of practical righteousness. He that
hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true
judgment between man and man, hath walked in God's
statutes, to keep His judgments and deals truly, is pronounced
just and shall therefore surely live. His life would
be spared.


III. The Conditions which bring Death.

If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that
doeth the like to any one of these things. And that doeth not any
of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and
defiled his neighbor's wife, Hath oppressed the poor and needy,
hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath
lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,
Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he
then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations;
he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him (verses 10-13).

Here then is the second supposed case of a son who had a
righteous father. This son lives in wickedness and defies
God's laws. He does not follow his father's piety, but is
unjust in every sense of the word. The question then is
asked, "Shall he live?" Can the merits of his father save[126]
him? And the divine answer is, "He shall not live&mdash;he shall
surely die." Physical death would come upon him and he
would be cut off in judgment.


IV. The Son does not Die for his Father's Sins.

Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins, which he
hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like. That hath
not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to
the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's
wife. Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge,
neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the
hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment. That hath
taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury
nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my
statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall
surely live. As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed,
spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good
among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity. Yet say
ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When
the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept
all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. The
soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity
of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son:
the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the
wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him (verses 14-20).

Still another case is considered so that the proverb of the
people might be completely answered and refuted. A
wicked father has a son who does righteously and follows
not in the wicked ways of his father. Such was the case with
several Kings of Judah. Ahaz was a wicked man and
Hezekiah, his son, was a God-fearing king; Josiah was also
the pious son of a wicked father. In such a case "the son
shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall surely
live." The father dies on account of his own iniquity.
This statement was in answer to their question, "Why does
not the son bear the iniquity of the father?" This foolish
reasoning from their side that the son could suffer for the
father's sin was a wicked invention to sustain them in their[127]
impenitent state and in their sins. They claimed no guilt
of their own, but charged their sufferings to the wickedness
of the fathers. But we have seen how perfectly the proverb
"the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's
teeth are set on edge," is answered in these paragraphs.


V. The Perfect Equity of God.

But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed,
and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and
right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his transgressions
that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him:
in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. Have I any
pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord God:
and not that he should return from his ways, and live? But when
the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth
iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the
wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he
hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath
trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house
of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and
committeth iniquity, and dieth in them: for his iniquity that he
hath done shall he die. Again, when the wicked man turneth
away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that
which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. Because
he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that
he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. Yet saith
the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of
Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal? Therefore
I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his
ways, saith the Lord God, Repent and turn yourselves from all
your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away
from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed;
and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die,
O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him
that dieth, saith the Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and
live ye (verses 21-32).

They had accused the Lord of injustice. "The way of the[128]
Lord is not equal" (verse 25). And Jehovah answers,
"Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not
your ways unequal?" He promises that the wicked is surely
to live, if he turns from all his sins. Jehovah has no pleasure
in the death of the wicked. He desires his return so that he
might live. How then would He punish them for the sins
of others, if He was ready no longer to mention even their
own transgressions? But if the righteous abandons righteousness
and committeth iniquity, then "in his sin that he
hath sinned, in them shall he die." The latter case has often
been used to defend the teaching that a truly converted
and therefore saved person, may, by sinning, be lost. If
only the Word of Truth were rightly divided such, and other
misinterpretations, would cease. Here we are on the ground
of the law dispensation, and, as already pointed out, the
Lord answers Israel, who were in relation to Him through
the law covenant and who refused to own their sins and
their guilt. The dispensation of Grace, in which Grace
reigns through righteousness has a different message. This
is fully illustrated if we compare the call to repentance in
verses 30-31 with the promise given in chapter xxxvi:26-17.
The Lord pleads with them to acknowledge their sinfulness;
He speaks to their conscience. "Repent, and turn yourselves
from all your transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your
ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby
ye have transgressed, and make you a new heart and a new
spirit; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?" But in
chapter xxxvi Grace speaks and promises to bestow, as
a gift, what a righteous God demands. "A new heart
also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you;
and I will take away the stony heart of your flesh, and
I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit
within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye
shall keep my judgments and do them." The result of this[129]
gift of grace, a new heart and His Spirit, is true repentance.
"Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your
doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your
own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations"
(chap. xxxvi:21). It was Augustine who said, "Give what
Thou requirest and then require what Thou will." All what
God requires He bestows in His infinite Grace through Jesus
Christ our Lord and then in possession of what Grace gives
we can be what God requires. But the thirty-sixth chapter,
where God no longer saith "make you a new heart," but
promises to give a new heart to His people, awaits, as regards
God's chosen people, its fulfilment. Here God pleads
with them to convince them that they were a sinful people
and that He is a just God.

In the last verse of this chapter the Lord answers the
question of verse 23, "Have I any pleasure at all that the
wicked should die?" His own answer is, "For I have no
pleasure in the death of Him that dieth, saith the Lord God,
wherefore turn yourselves and live." And yet all these
gracious pleadings were not heeded.


LAMENTATION OVER THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL.

Chapter xix.

This chapter ends that section of the book which began
with the twelfth chapter. And it is a fitting conclusion, this
great lamentation over the Princes of Israel, and over the
land of Judah. The English translation does not do justice
to the original Hebrew; the outburst of lamentation is written
in a poetic form, some kind of an elegy. The lamentation
has two sections.


I. The Lamentations over the Princes of Israel.

Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel.
And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among[130]
lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions. And she
brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned
to catch the prey; it devoured men. The nations also heard of him;
he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto
the land of Egypt. Now when she saw that she had waited, and
her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made
him a young lion. And he went up and down among the lions,
he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured
men. And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid
waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness
thereof, by the noise of his roaring. Then the nations set against
him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over
him: he was taken in their pit. And they put him in ward in
chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought
him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the
mountains of Israel (verses 1-9).

The lamentation is not the lamentation of Ezekiel, as so
many expositors state, but it is the lamentation of Jehovah,
the same who later wept over the same city and lamented
over her coming fate. The words of divine lament were put
into the mouth of the Prophet.

The Princes are Jehoahaz and Jehoachin. King Jehoahaz
and his fate, being carried away captive into Egypt (2 Kings
xxiii:33) is lamented in verses 1-4. King Jehoiachin who
was taken as a captive to Babylon is lamented in verses 5-9.
In Ezekiel, however, the word King is not used; the Kings are
always called princes. The second verse may be rendered as
follows:


"Thy mother was like a lioness, among lions.
She couched amid the young lions, she reared the whelps."


The mother is Judah. Of this Jacob had spoken in his
prophecy. "Judah is a lion's whelp" (Gen. xlix:9). And
Balaam in his prophetic utterances speaks in the same tones
of the nation. "Behold, the people shall rise up as a great
lion, and lift up himself as a young lion" (Num. xxiv:14).
This prophecy will be fulfilled in the future when He appears[131]
in power and glory to receive the Kingdom, for He is called
"the lion of the tribe of Judah" (Rev. v:5). And the people
will then be as a converted and restored people the same,
what the lion is among the animals, the Kingly nation. In
Isaiah xxix:1 Jerusalem is called "Ariel," which means "Lion
of God." The whelps, the nations heard of, are the sons of the
House of David. And Jehoahaz "devoured men" and did
evil in the sight of the Lord and was carried away by Pharaoh
Necho as a captive into Egypt. Some expositors think
that the lioness is the wife of Josiah the mother of Jehoahaz,
because she was a woman of much importance and great
influence (Jer. xiii:18; 2 Kings ii:9; xxiv:12).

The other one of her whelps mentioned in verse 5, whom
the lioness, Judah, made a young lion, that is a King, was
Jehoiachin. Jehoiachin was made King, when all hope of a
return of Jehoahaz was lost, and the new King also "devoured
men," did evil in the sight of the Lord. "And he did that
which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that
his fathers had done" (2 Kings xxiv:90). In verse 7 the word
"palaces" should be changed to "widows." The verse describes
the cruelties and wicked deeds of the King. Then
judgment overtook him. Under him the first deportation
to Babylon took place, in which the Prophet Ezekiel was included.
"And he (Nebuchadnezzar) carried away Jehoiachin
to Babylon, and the King's mother, and the King's wife, and
his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into
captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon" (2 Kings xxiv:14).
The correct rendering of the next part of verse 9 is: "And they
put him in a cage with hooks and brought him to the King of
Babylon." Both Kings deserved their fate. God had
warned, and as they continued in wickedness judgment fell
upon them. And it was a warning to Zedekiah who was
soon to share the same fate. In view of the violence which
is on the earth now, the wickedness which is seen on all sides,[132]
these judgments of the past may well be remembered. God
is the same to-day as He was of old. He must deal in judgment
with sin; in many parts of the holy Scriptures we read
of the time when God will keep not silence, but deal with
conditions on the earth according to His righteousness.


II. The Lamentation over the Land of Judah.

Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters;
she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and
her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared
in her height with the multitude of her branches. But she was
plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east
wind dried up her fruit; her strong rods were broken and withered;
the fire consumed them. And now she is planted in the wilderness,
in a dry and thirsty ground. And fire is gone out of a rod of her
branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong
rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be
for a lamentation (verses 10-14).

Judah typified by a vine is not a new figure in Ezekiel.
See chapters xv:1-5; xvii:6-10. The statement here reminds
us also of Psalm lxxx:8-11. Many were the blessings
Judah enjoyed, like a vine planted by the waters, fruitful
and full of branches. The eleventh verse describes the
period of Judah's greatest prosperity under David and Solomon.
Then the judgment which comes upon the land, the
east wind is typical of the Chaldeans which swept from the
East and spoiled the vine. The fire of divine wrath burned in
their midst. Her exilic judgment is pictured in the next verse:
"And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and
thirsty land." And the fire of judgment came out of a rod of
her branches, that is, the judgment came upon them on account
of their wicked Kings. Thus ends the sorrowful lamentation
over the princes and the land of Judah. But there
is a better future in store for the land and the people, a
future which can only be realized in Him, who said, "I am[133]
the true vine." Israel still is under the rod, but in God's
own time the curse will give way to the promised blessing,
for God's gifts and calling are without repentance.


FURTHER AND FINAL PREDICTIONS CONCERNING
THE JUDGMENT OF JERUSALEM.

Chapter xx.

With this chapter we enter upon the last prophecies
given through the prophet before the fall of the City of
Jerusalem. There is first an arraignment of the unfaithful
nation. This is followed by the divine announcement that
the sword of the Lord is now to be drawn to do its judgment
work. The twenty-first chapter, in which this announcement
is made, has been called the sword-song. In chapter xxii
another arraignment of the people and the sins of Jerusalem
is given and the corruption of all classes, prophets, priests,
princes and the mass of people is described. Once more in
chapter xxiii the wickedness and vileness of Samaria and
Judah is uncovered, corresponding to the similar message
in chapter xvi. The last prophetic message of this cycle was
given on the day when the siege of Jerusalem began. On
the same day Ezekiel's wife died; the prophet was commanded
not to mourn. All this has a meaning in connection
with Jerusalem's complete fall. Thus God waited and waited
for the repentance of His people and sent these burning messages
to them till at last there was no remedy and judgment
had to come.


I. A Retrospect of the Nation's Sins.

And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the
tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to
enquire of the Lord and sat before me. Then came the word of the
Lord unto me, saying, Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel,
and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Are ye come to enquire[134]
of me? As I live, saith the Lord God, I will not be enquired
of by you. Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge
them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers: And
say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; In the day when I chose
Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob,
and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I
lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the Lord your God;
In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them to bring them forth
of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing
with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; Then said I
unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes,
and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the Lord
your God. But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken
unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of
their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said,
I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against
them in the midst of the land of Egypt. But I wrought for my
name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen,
among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto
them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt (verses 1-9).

There is first a review of the nation's sin in Egypt. At
the time given in the first verse the elders came to the
prophet to enquire of the Lord. Outwardly it seemed as if
these enquiring elders were sincere and came in the spirit
of humility acknowledging the prophet's authority. But
the Lord knoweth the heart; He read their innermost
thoughts and knew that their inquiry was only a sham; the
real heart exercise in true repentance was lacking. So He
tells them through the prophet, "As I live&mdash;I will not be
inquired of by you. Wilt thou judge them, son of man,
wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations
of their fathers." Instead of giving them a message
of comfort and encouragement, Ezekiel, here addressed
again as son of man, is commanded to judge them, that is
to put before them their sins and to pronounce judgment
upon the nation. The same phrase is found twice more
in this section. "Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge,[135]
wilt thou judge the bloody city? Yea thou shalt show
her all her abominations" (xxii:2). See also xxiii:36. And
first of all the prophet had to show them the nation's sins
in Egypt. He had chosen them as a nation; He had made
Himself known to them in Egypt and had lifted up His
hand unto them saying, "I am the Lord your God." He had
entered into covenant relations with Israel and pledged
Himself to bring them out of Egypt into the land, which
here is called "the glory of all lands." From verses 7 and 8
we learn that Israel was contaminated by the idol worship of
Egypt and a holy God was ready to pour upon them His
fury in the midst of the land of Egypt. But sovereign
mercy prevailed and instead of making Himself known to
the nation in judgment, He made Himself known in bringing
them forth out of Egypt.

Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
and brought them into the wilderness. And I gave them my
statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a man do, he
shall even live in them. Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths,
to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I
am the Lord that sanctify them. But the house of Israel rebelled
against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and
they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live
in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said,
I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume
them. But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not
be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I
would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing
with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands. Because
they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but
polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither
did I make an end of them in the wilderness (verses 10-17).

In these verses we have the history of the first generation
in the wilderness. His hand brought them out of the land[136]
of Egypt into the wilderness and there He gave them the
law and the different sabbaths, the feasts of Jehovah.
Their sins and failures in the wilderness are briefly sketched.
They rebelled; they were disobedient; they despised His
judgments and polluted His sabbaths. Then comes the
statement that this first generation was not to enter into
the land promised unto them. Again in sovereign mercy
He spared them and did not make a complete end of them in
the wilderness.

But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the
statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile
yourselves with their idols: I am the Lord your God; walk in my
statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; And hallow my
sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye
may know that I am the Lord your God. Notwithstanding the
children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes,
neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he
shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said,
I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger
against them in the wilderness. Nevertheless I withdrew mine
hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted
in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them
forth. I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness,
that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them
through the countries; Because they had not executed my judgments,
but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths,
and their eyes were after their fathers' idols. Wherefore
I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby
they should not live; And I polluted them in their own gifts,
in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the
womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might
know that I am the Lord (verses 18-26).

And now the record of the second generation in the
wilderness is brought to their notice. They were just as
rebellious as their fathers, who fell in the wilderness. They
also were worshippers of idols in the wilderness, besides
offering sacrifices and offerings unto Jehovah (Amos v:25-27).[137]
The statement in verse 25 "wherefore I gave them also
statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they
should not live," has been explained in different ways. It
cannot mean the law, for that is holy, just and good. "The
solution is due to the simple principle that God in His
government chastens His guilty people retributively and
calls the scourges His own, even when the instruments may
be wholly foreign to His mind and heart." They were
disobedient to His statutes and then in punishment for their
sins He let them go into the terrible worship of Moloch, in
casting their first-born into the fire as a sacrifice to the
idol-god. It is the same principle here as in Romans i:26-28.
God gave them up in every way after they had turned away
from Him. It was a punishment for their sins.


II. Their Sins in the Land.

Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say
unto them. Thus saith the Lord God: Yet in this your fathers have
blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up
mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all
the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there
they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they
made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.
Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go?
And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day. Wherefore
say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; Are ye
polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom
after their abominations? For when ye offer your gifts,
when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves
with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be
enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord
God, I will not be enquired of by you. And that which cometh into
your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen,
as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone
(verses 27-32).

According to His promise He brought them into the land.[138]
He did not go back on His Word, in spite of their failure,
for God's gifts and calling are without repentance. And
thus they continued in their evil ways, committing all
manner of abominations. And therefore the Lord said to
the inquiring elders, "And shall I be enquired of by you, O
house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord God, I will not
be enquired of by you." Verse 32 shows that in the iniquity
of their heart they wanted to be like the heathen to serve
wood and stone; but God would take care that this should
not be, for He had chosen them to be His nation.


III. Judgment and Mercy in Future Restoration.

As I live, saith the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand, and
with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule
over you. And I will bring you out from the people, and will
gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a
mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured
out. And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and
there will I plead with you face to face. Like as I pleaded with
your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead
with you, saith the Lord God. And I will cause you to pass under
the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that
transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country
where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel:
and ye shall know that I am the Lord. As for you, O house of
Israel, thus saith the Lord God; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols,
and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye
my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols, For
in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel,
saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in
the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require
your offerings, and the first fruits of your oblations, with all
your holy things. I will accept you with your sweet savour, when
I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries
wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in
you before the heathen. And ye shall know that I am the Lord,
when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for
the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers. And[139]
there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein
ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight
for all your evils that ye have committed. And ye shall know
that I am the Lord, when I have wrought with you for my name's
sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your
corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord God
(verses 33-44).

In this paragraph we read of their future punishment
and also of the mercy which is in store for the believing
remnant of the nation in the future restoration, of which
all the prophets of God have spoken. In the wilderness of
people, their dispersion among all the nations of the world,
He will plead with them and bring them under the rod.
The rebels will be purged out from the nation and they shall
not enter into the land of Israel. In verses 40-44 we have
a prophecy concerning their true restoration. They will be
accepted, brought back and gathered out from all the
countries and brought into the land of Israel, as God has
promised them. Then the remnant of Israel will remember
their ways and repent of their evil.


IV. The Forest Consumed by Fire.

And the word of the Lord came unto me saying, Son of man,
set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south,
and prophesy against the forest of the south field; And say to the
forest of the south, Hear the word of the Lord; Thus saith the
Lord God; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour
every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame
shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall
be burned therein. And all flesh shall see that I the Lord have
kindled it: it shall not be quenched. Then said I, Ah Lord God!
they say of me, Doth he not speak parables (verses 45-49).

It is a parable. The forest of the south field is Judea;
its complete and terrible conquest is here again predicted.
The fire of judgment is to sweep through it, like a mighty
forest fire which cannot be quenched. And when Ezekiel[140]
had faithfully delivered his message, his hearers said, "Doth
he not speak in parables?" They refused to understand.


THE IMPENDING JUDGMENT.

Chapter xxi.

"Then said I, Oh, Lord God! they say of me, Doth he
not speak in parables?" This is the last verse of the preceding
chapter. It showed the hardened conditions of
their hearts, which rejected the Word of God, the word of
warning and the call to repentance. These sad conditions
of the people in Ezekiel's day are deeply significant for our
times. We see the outwardly professing people of God,
the large numbers of unsaved, nominal Christians in the
same hardened condition. Though God speaks loudly,
the Word is not heeded. A stronger judgment message follows
in which the sword of the Lord is prominent. Critics
have acknowledged the majestic character of the so-called
"Song of the Sword," and say that the prophet now speaks
in "maddened frenzy," carried away by his own passion,
breaking out, "in a state of wild excitement," denouncing
the nation. But it is not the prophet who gives way to
his own feeling. The first verse dispels at once such a conception.
"And the Word of the Lord came unto me, saying:"
It is the Lord who speaks through Ezekiel.


I. The Sword to be Drawn.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, set
thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy
places, and prophesy against the land of Israel. And say to the
land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, and
will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee
the righteous and the wicked. Seeing then that I will cut off from
thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth
out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn forth my sword[141]
out of his sheath: it shall not return any more. Sigh, therefore,
thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness
sigh before their eyes. And it shall be, when they say unto thee,
Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shall answer, For the tidings,
because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall
be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak
as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith
the Lord God (verses 1-7).

A fearful word it is coming from the lips of Jehovah, who
had yearned over Jerusalem and the nation, "Behold, I am
against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath,
and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked." It
was to be an indiscriminate execution of God's judgment,
those who claimed righteousness were to fall under the
sword of vengeance like the wicked. It was to be a widespread
judgment. "My sword shall go forth out of its sheath
against all flesh&mdash;that all flesh may know that I the Lord
have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not
return any more." While here it refers to all the nations,
to Jerusalem as well as to Judea, there are other prophecies
which include under the term "all flesh" the Gentile nations
as well. "For by fire and by His sword will the Lord
plead with all flesh, and the slain of the Lord shall be many"
(Isa. lxvi:16). Fear and the pit, and the snare, are upon
thee, O inhabitant of the earth" (Isa. xxiv:17). This
will be at the close of the present age. And do not the
events in the world to-day indicate the rapid approach
of the judgment sword?

And God's servant was commanded to sigh with bitterness
before their eyes. He was to tell them the reason of
his agony. "Because it cometh; and my heart shall melt,
and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint,
and all knees shall be weak as water. Behold it cometh
and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord God." It was
not the time for rejoicing, but for weeping and sighing.[142]
The prophet was called upon to show forth in his behavior
the solemn days which were now to come. And our Lord
has predicted for our age upon earth distress of nations,
with perplexity; the sea and the waves thereof roaring.
"Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after
those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers
of heaven shall be shaken" (Luke xxi:25-26). But how
little sighing with bitterness there is to-day among God's
servants in view of what is in store for an ungodly and
unbelieving age!


II. The Sharpening of the Sword.

Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord; Say, A sword, a sword is
sharpened, and also furbished: It is sharpened to make a sore
slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make
mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree. And he hath
given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened,
and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
Cry and howl, son of man; for it shall be upon my people, it shall
be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword
shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh. Because
it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be
no more, saith the Lord God. Thou, therefore, son of man, prophesy,
and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled
the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great
men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their
heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright,
it is wrapped up for the slaughter. Go thee one way or other, either
on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.
I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to
rest: I the Lord have said it (verses 8-17).

The sword of judgment is now described as being prepared
for the slaughter. How all this should have a meaning for
us at the present time. All the nations of the earth, who
boasted but yesterday of a civilization which makes for[143]
righteousness and peace, are either at war or are preparing
for war. May we not see behind it all the sword of the Lord?
Has He not begun judgment among those nations? The
threatening vengeance of the Lord will ere long fall upon
this age which so long has turned a deaf ear to the wooings
of His love. And the question here is asked, "Should we
then make mirth?" Is this the time of mirth, worldly
enjoyment and indifference? Not for God's people who
discern the signs of the times and who know from the Word
of God the coming events. The place for us is in "Bochim"
(Judges ii:4-5. "Bochim" means "Weeping.") The time
of the sharpening of the sword is the time for His people
to trim their lamps, for earnest heart-searching and prayer.
The character of the unsaved, nominal "Christian" masses
is also being clearly revealed. They show what they are,
"lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God." Though the
sword is being drawn and sharpened, they are given to
mirth and pleasure, like the company described in 1 Sam.
xxx:16. The sword of judgment will find them in their
merry-making and will change all into weeping and gnashing
of teeth.

Again the prophet is commanded to cry and to howl, to
smite upon his thigh and to smite his hands together, in
view of the coming terrors of judgment. And solemnly the
Lord saith, "I will also smite mine hands together, and I
will satisfy my fury."


III. The King of Babylon and His Divination.

The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying, Also, thou
son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of
Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land:
and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the
city. Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced. For the king
of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two[144]
ways, to use divination: he shook his arrows to and fro, he consulted
with images, he looked in the liver. At this right hand
was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the
mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to
appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to
build a fort. And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their
sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance
the iniquity, that they may be taken. Therefore thus
saith the Lord God: Because ye have made your iniquity to be
remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that
in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are
come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand (verses
18-24).

The King of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, is the chosen instrument
through whom the drawn and sharpened sword
does its judgment work. He is seen in this paragraph
using divination, to decide if he should go to Rabbath
of the Ammonites or to Judah in Jerusalem. The King
is standing at the parting of the way, at the head of the
two ways. First he used the arrows. The authorized
version is faulty in its translation; it is not, "he made his
arrows bright," but "he shook his arrows to and fro." The
Babylonians used all kinds of enchantments, sorceries, as
well as star-gazers, astrologers, etc., to be guided in their
undertakings. (See Isa. xlvii:8-15). The King took two
arrows and put upon each the name of the two cities mentioned;
they were then shaken in the quiver and one was
drawn out. He also used images (teraphim) which he consulted
and looked into the liver. They generally killed a
sheep and imagined that the different lines and formation of
the liver gave them directions what to do. In the British
Museum there is a Babylonian clay tablet with a sheep's
liver covered with all kinds of lines and oracles. In the
twenty-second verse we see the result of his divinations.
He has pulled out of the quiver the arrow which has on it
the word "Jerusalem." And so the siege of Jerusalem was[145]
prepared. But the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who heard
of the King's divination, branded it as a false divination
(verse 23). They still hoped that all attempts made by
Nebuchadnezzar would fail. But the hand of God was
guiding all, and in the last verse of this paragraph (verse
25) the Lord announces the hopelessness of their expectations.


IV. The Wicked Prince and the Coming One.

And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come,
when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God; Remove
the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same:
exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn,
overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose
right it is; and I will give it him (verses 25-27).

And now follows a most interesting utterance of the
prophet which has a future meaning. There can be no question
that Zedekiah is first of all in view as the profane wicked[15]
prince of Israel. But the prophecy looks far beyond Zedekiah.
It is the coming wicked prince, the one who comes
in his own name, the final Antichrist, the false Messiah,
or, as he is also called in Revelation, the false prophet.
That verse 25 refers to the time of the end is seen by the
words, "in the time of the iniquity of the end" (correct translation).
The same phrase appears in Dan. xi:35-39, "the
time of the end," and the person described in that passage
is the Antichrist, the wicked prince. It is the time of the
future great tribulation "when the transgressors are come
to the full" (Dan. viii:23). This false Christ will claim
priestly and kingly honors. He is the beast out of the
earth (Rev. xiii) having two horns like a lamb, but speaking
as a dragon. The two horns represent the priesthood[146]
and the kingship he assumes. And this we learn from
verse 26 is the character of the wicked prince of Israel of
whom Ezekiel speaks. Again, we must correct the faulty
translation of the authorized version: "Remove the mitre
and take off the crown"; the word "diadem" is mitre, the
head-dress of the high-priest (Exod. xxviii:4). He wears
the mitre of the priest and the crown of the king. He is
Satan's final counterfeit (like the pope) of the Priest-King.
In verse 27 the overturning times are mentioned. Thrice
it is stated, "I will overturn." Even so will it be at the time
of the end until He comes whose right it is. And the coming
One, who will exalt what is low and abase what is high, who
will remove the mitre and the crown from the Antichrist,
destroying him by the brightness of His coming (2 Thess. ii)
is the Lord Jesus Christ. It is interesting to see that there is
in the Hebrew a word used which is very suggestive. In
Genesis xlix:10 we have Christ spoken of as Shiloh. The
word "until He come" in the Hebrew is almost the same as
Shiloh; it is Shelloh. And surely the overturning times are
almost upon us, and soon that profane wicked Prince may
arise. However, we do not wait for that wicked one; we
wait for the Lord.


V. The Judgment to Fall Upon Ammon.

And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God
concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even
say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is
furbished, to consume because of the glittering: While they see
vanity unto thee, while they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee
upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked whose day is
come, when their iniquity shall have an end. Shall I cause it to
return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou
wast created, in the land of thy nativity. And I will pour out
mine indignation upon thee; I will blow against thee in the fire of
my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and[147]
skillful to destroy. Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood
shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more, for I the
Lord have spoken it (verses 28-32).

The judgment came upon the Ammonites is threatened
here. But it must not be overlooked that this prophecy
also has a further meaning, for the same words "in the time
of the iniquity of the end" (verse 29) appears here. And
yet there is also promised for the future a restoration of
Ammon (Jer. xlix:6).


JERUSALEM'S ABOMINATIONS.

Chapter xxii.

This chapter describes again the sins and abominations of
Jerusalem. Before the sharpened sword of divine justice
and retribution does its dreadful work, the Lord uncovers
the guilt and vileness of the city and lays bare the corruption
of her prophets, priests and princes, as well as the people.


I. The Violence and Abominations of Jerusalem.

Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Now, thou
son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea,
thou shalt shew her all her abominations. Then say thou, Thus
saith the Lord God; The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that
her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.
Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed;
and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made;
and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto
thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen,
and a mocking to all countries. Those that be near, and those that
be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much
vexed. Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to
their power to shed blood. In thee have they set light by father
and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression
with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the
widow. Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned
my sabbaths. In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood:[148]
and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they
commit lewdness. In thee have they discovered their fathers'
nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for
pollution. And one hath committed abomination with his
neighbor's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law;
and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's
daughter. In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast
taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy
neighbors by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God.
Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain
which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the
midst of thee. Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong,
in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the Lord have spoken it,
and will do it. And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse
thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of
thee. And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight
of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord (verses
1-16).

Jerusalem is called here a bloody city on account of the
deeds of violence which were committed in her midst. Once
it was a faithful city, full of judgment and righteousness;
but she had become an harlot, and murderers lodged in it
(Isaiah i:21). The prophets and the righteous had been
killed in her midst. And He who sent these messages of
warning and impending judgment, who waited so patiently
for Jerusalem's repentance and the return of His people,
came in the fullness of time, in the midst of His people and
to that city. Before He went to the cross of Calvary, where
He gave Himself and where also Jerusalem's bloodguiltiness
was fearfully crowned by killing the Prince of Life (Acts
iii:15), He stood before that city with tear-filled eyes
and uttered those tender and never to be forgotten words:
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets
and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would
I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathered
her chickens under her wings, and ye would not" (Matt.[149]
xxiii:37). And Stephen said, "Which of the prophets have
not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them
which showed before of the coming of the Just One, of whom
ye have been now the betrayers and murderers" (Acts vii:52).
"His blood be upon us and our children" was their awful
cry, when the bloody city delivered Him into the hands of
the Gentiles, and ever since they have been, Cain-like, the
homeless wanderers among the nations, till some day they
will acknowledge their bloodguiltiness and turn to Him.
And in this chapter the Lord describes all her violence
and abominations. All were guilty of violence and the
shedding of blood, especially the princes, the Kings of
Judah. (See Jeremiah xxvi:21 and xxxviii:4, etc.). And
inasmuch as they had turned away from Jehovah and
worshipped idols, moral corruption and the vile things
man is capable of were likewise present.

And such are also the conditions to-day among the nations,
which profess to be Christian; violence and bloodshed,
moral corruption and abomination. May we not forget
that the Lord, who knew Jerusalem's guilt and judged her
for it, is the same to-day, who will judge the violence and
the abominations on the earth among nations whose privileges
have been even greater than the privileges and blessings
of Jerusalem. "Thou hast forgotten Me," was Jehovah's
accusation against the city. Had they remembered Jehovah's
kindness, His gracious dealing with their fathers,
had they remembered His Word, these abominations would
not have come to pass. And the source of the violence, the
bloodshed, the moral darkness in the world to-day, is, that
the nations have forgotten God. The judgment of the city
is again announced.


II. The Smelting Furnace.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, the
house of Israel is to me become dross; all they are brass and tin and[150]
iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of
silver. Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because ye are all become
dross, behold, therefore, I will gather you into the midst of
Jerusalem. As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and
tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt
it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will
leave you there, and melt you. Yea, I will gather you, and blow
upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst
thereof. As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye
be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the Lord
have poured out my fury upon you (verses 17-23).

The smelting furnace is the symbol of Jehovah's fiery
indignation against Jerusalem and its inhabitants. A furnace
is either for refining or for destruction. In the future
the remnant of Israel will be refined by the fires of persecution
and tribulation (Mal. iii:1-3). To the godly part of His
earthly people He saith, "Behold I have refined thee, but
not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction"
(Isaiah xlviii:10). But here in Ezekiel's message it is not
the question of refining but of punishment by fire. Israel
is dross. Brass, tin, iron, lead, dross of silver are mentioned,
but gold is significantly omitted. It stands for
righteousness and that was lacking in Jerusalem. The
fury of the Lord would fan the flame and all gathered together,
like worthless metals would be melted by the wrath
of the Lord.


III. The Corruption of the Prophets, the Priests and the
Princes.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained
upon in the day of indignation. There is a conspiracy of her
prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey:
they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious
things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy
things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane,[151]
neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the
clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned
among them. Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves
ravening the prey, to shed blood and to destroy souls, to get dishonest
gain. And her prophets have daubed them with untempered
mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them,
saying, Thus saith the Lord God, when the Lord hath not spoken.
The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery,
and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed
the stranger wrongfully. And I sought for a man among them,
that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me
for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I
recompensed upon their head, saith the Lord God (verses 23-31).

What corruption this additional message of the Lord
reveals! The land had already been cursed for the wicked
deeds of its tenants. The religious leaders, the prophets,
these false prophets with their lying messages, instead of
saving souls and warning to flee from the wrath to come,
devoured souls. The priests, called to minister in holy
things, were as bad; they profaned the holy things. They
were blasphemers instead of worshippers. These characteristics
of false prophets and false priests are repeated in
our own times. Like these false prophets whom Ezekiel
describes, the modern day religious leaders, mislead the
people by giving lying messages and by glossing over men's
sins and not giving to them the Word of the Lord. Like
priests, like people! The people were lovers of money and
oppressors of the poor. Jehovah looked for a man to
stand in the gap between Him and the land, but there
was none. There is no help and hope in man, for all have
gone astray and there is none that doeth good. But there
is One&mdash;blessed be God!&mdash;who has stood in the gap, our Lord
Jesus Christ. "And He saw that there was no man, and
wondered that there was none to interpose, therefore His[152]
own arm brought salvation to Him, and His righteousness,
it upheld Him" (Isaiah lix:16). Through Him "all Israel"
is yet to be saved and receive the promised blessings.


THE TWO SISTERS AHOLAH AND AHOLIBAH.

Chapter xxiii.

Once more a parable is given to illustrate and expose the
wickedness of Samaria and Jerusalem in their ungodly relationship
with Assyria and Chaldea. On the whole, this
chapter bears a similar message as the one contained in
chapter xvi, however, with this difference that here the
later history of the two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Israel
and the Kingdom of Judah and their defilement with heathen
nations is the prominent feature. The chapter has five
sections.


I. The Two Sisters Aholah and Aholibah.

The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, Son of man,
there were two women, the daughters of one mother: And they
committed whoredom in Egypt; they committed whoredom in their
youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised
the teats of their virginity. And the names of them were Aholah
the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they
bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is
Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah (verses 1-4).

The two daughters of one mother are Samaria and Jerusalem,
called sisters in chapter xvi:46. They were sisters
not only because they had the same mother, the Jewish
nation, but they were also sisters in their vile idolatry.
Samaria is called Aholah. Aholah means "her tent." Jerusalem
is named Aholibah, "my tent is in her." The latter
denotes the fact that the true sanctuary was in Judah, while
the Kingdom of Israel, Samaria, practised a "false worship."
Yet Jehovah owned them both as His people.[153]


II. Aholah's Wickedness.

And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and
she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,
Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of
them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that
were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted:
with all their idols she defiled herself. Neither left she her whoredoms
brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and
they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom
upon her. Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of
her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters,
and slew her with the sword and she became famous
among women; for they had executed judgment upon her
(verses 5-10).

Aholah's, Samaria's, wickedness is described first. It
began with Jeroboam's idolatry (1 Kings xii:25) and became
worse and worse. They went to Assyria and shared their
corruption in idolatry and made a covenant with that
nation (Hosea xii:2). Thus Samaria played the harlot by
forsaking the Lord and turning to Assyria, trusting on
Assyria instead of on the Lord, and then she defiled herself
with all their idols. Hosea described their condition.
"Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart; they call
to Egypt, they go to Assyria. When they shall go I will
spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the
fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation
hath heard. Woe unto them! for they have fled from
me; destruction unto them! because they have transgressed
against me, though I have redeemed them, yet they
have spoken lies against me" (Hosea vii:11-13). The judgment
of Samaria is also mentioned. The Lord delivered
the people into the hands of the nation with which they had
become enamored, to discover their nakedness. "Wherefore,
I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the[154]
hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted." The historical
record of this is found in 2 Kings xvii, when Hoshea,
King of Samaria, became servant to Shalmaneser, King of
Assyria. And when Hoshea acted treacherously, Shalmaneser
imprisoned Samaria's king and led the people away
into Assyria.


III. The Wickedness of Aholibah.

And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in
her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredom more than her
sister in her whoredom. She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours,
captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding
upon horses, all of them desirable young men. Then I saw that she
was defiled, that they took both one way, And that she increased
her whoredom: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the
images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermillion, Girded with
girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads,
all of them princes to look to, after the manner of their nativity:
And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them,
and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. And the Babylonians
came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with
their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was
alienated from them. So she discovered her whoredom, and discovered
her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her,
like as my mind was alienated from her sister. Yet she multiplied
her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth,
wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. For she
doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and
whose issue is like the issue of horses. Thus thou calledst to remembrance
the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the
Egyptians for the paps of thy youth (verses 11-21).

And her sister Aholibah, Jerusalem, saw this, but did not
profit by it. She became even more corrupt than Samaria
and increased her whoredoms. She was enjoying greater
privileges and blessings than Samaria and therefore her
wickedness and fall was greater. King Ahaz, when pressed
by Rezin, the King of Syria and Remaliah, King of Israel,
sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser, King of Assyria, with[155]
the message, "I am thy servant and thy son, come up and
save me" (2 Kings xvi:5-8.)

He also took the silver and gold in the house of the Lord
and gave it as a present to the Assyrian King. Isaiah's
message and offer as described in Isaiah vii he refused.
Then King Ahaz "went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser,
King of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus.
And King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest, the fashion of the
altar, and the patterns of it, according to all the workmanship
thereof." This strange altar was set up in Jerusalem,
and the house of the Lord was defiled by him (2 Kings xvi:10-20).
Likewise, Jerusalem also followed the Chaldeans
and was inflamed by the pictures of the Chaldeans portrayed
on walls in vermillion, the peculiar color used by the the Chaldeans.
She loved Chaldea, Babylon with her vile idolatry,
and sent messengers to the Chaldeans. And the Babylonians
responded and came to her to corrupt Jerusalem. Then
Jehovah says: "My mind was alienated from her, like as my
mind was alienated from her sister." Yet she continued in
her evil ways. In all this we have a description of Jerusalem's
history in becoming defiled by heathen nations, their
idolatries and corresponding immoralities.


IV. Aholibah's Punishment.

Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will
raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated,
and I will bring them against thee on every side; the Babylonians,
and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians
with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and
rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and
wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against
thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set
judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their
judgments. And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall
deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine
ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy[156]
sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the
fire. They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away
thy fair jewels. Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee,
and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou
shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any
more. For thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will deliver thee
into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from
whom thy mind is alienated: And they shall deal with thee hatefully,
and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked
and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered,
both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. I will do these things unto
thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because
thou art polluted with their idols. Thou hast walked in the
way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.
Thus saith the Lord God; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup
deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision;
it containeth much. Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and
sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup
of thy sister Samaria. Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and
thou shalt break the shreds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts:
for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God. Therefore thus saith the
Lord God; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind
thy back, therefore bear thou thy lewdness and thy whoredoms
(verses 22-35).

And those with whom she had sinned were to be her
chastisers. "Behold I will raise up thy lovers against
thee.... I will bring them against thee on every side."
Her well-deserved judgment would be, as it was, in the hands
of the Babylonians, all the Chaldeans, as well as the Assyrians....
And they shall come against thee with chariots,
wagons and wheels, with an assembly of people, which
shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round
about, and I will set judgment before them, and they shall
judge thee according to their judgment." A holy and
righteous God in His wrath moved these vile nations to heap
upon this disobedient and idolatrous people the worst punishments.
"They shall deal furiously with thee, they shall
take away thy nose and thine ears, and thy remnant shall[157]
fall by the sword; they shall take thy sons and thy daughters,
and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire." The explorations
in Assyria have brought to light wall-sculptures in
which such atrocities are depicted. God is righteous, and
divine retribution was thus manifested in Jerusalem's
shameful history. And in our own times we behold similar
judgments in the earth meted out upon nations, professedly
Christian, who forgot God and rejected His holy Word. Jerusalem
had walked in the ways of her vile sister Samaria and
had even outdone her in wickedness. She was, therefore, to
drink her cup, "because thou hast forgotten me and cast me
behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and
thy whoredoms." Jerusalem had seen all what happened
to the northern kingdom when Shalmaneser had carried them
away, yet she kept right on in her evil course and did not
repent of her idolatries, her vile immoralities and wickedness.
And so it is to-day. Nations reap what they have
sown, and other nations, like our own, do not take the warning.
They continue in the downward course, rejecting
God's holy Word and are guilty of the same sins as the nations
who drink now the cup of divine displeasure. Ere
long the judgments of God will reach every nation for the
evil they have done.


V. Final Rehearsal of their Sins and Punishments.

The Lord said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge
Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;
That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands,
and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also
caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through
the fire, to devour them. Moreover this they have done unto me:
they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned
my sabbaths. For when they had slain their children to their
idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane
it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.
And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,[158]
unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom
thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself
with ornaments, And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared
before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine
oil. And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and
with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the
wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful
crowns upon their heads. Then said I unto her that was old in
adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she
with them? Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman
that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto
Aholibah, the lewd women.

And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner
of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood;
because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. For thus
saith the Lord God; I will bring up a company upon them, and
will give them to be removed and spoiled. And the company shall
stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords;
they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their
houses with fire. Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the
land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall
bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord
God (verses 36-49).

Little comment is needed on this final section; there is a
recapitulation of the sins of Aholah and Aholibah. They
committed adultery with their idols, both in a spiritual way
and also literally. Their offspring were cast into the fiery
arms of Moloch and thus slain to their idols. They profaned
the sanctuary of the Lord. Adulterers they were and
blood was in their hands. What degradation! Licentiousness,
violence and child sacrifice were the leading sins of the
nation and these were produced by having forgotten God
and by idolatry. The punishment of the adulterers, according
to the law, stoning, awaited Jerusalem. "And the company
shall stone them with stones and dispatch them with their
swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and
burn up their houses with fire. Thus will I cause lewdness[159]
to cease out of the land, that all women (surrounding nations
who knew of Jerusalem's vileness) be taught not to go after
your lewdness. And they (the heathen nations) shall
recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the
sins of your idols, and ye shall know that I am the Lord."
The Lord had manifested Himself to Jerusalem as a Lord
of grace and power. He had dealt with that nation as He
had not dealt with others. "You only have I known of all
the families of the earth, therefore I will punish you for all
your iniquities" (Amos iii:2). In awful judgments they were
to learn that He is the Lord; what they should have known
through His mercies, they found out by the punishment
from the hands of a righteous Lord. All this will be repeated
in future history. The time is not distant when still
greater judgments will be poured out upon nations as well
as upon the Jewish people. During that time the world will
find out that He is the Lord. "For when thy judgments
are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn
righteousness" (Is. xxvi:9).


THE BOILING POT AND THE LAST WORD.

Chapter xxiv.

We have reached the final message of this great Prophet
concerning the judgment and overthrow of Jerusalem. The
fatal siege of the city which sealed its doom, so long announced,
had started. Ezekiel receives the information
directly from the Lord and then utters the solemn words
of the Lord in which for the last time the wickedness of the
bloody city is made known. First, he spoke in a parable
and afterwards in the death of his wife he was a sign unto
them.


I. The Parable of the Boiling Pot and its Significance.

[160]Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of
the month, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of
man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the
king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day. And
utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus
saith the Lord God; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water
into it: Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece,
the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones. Take the
choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it
boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein. Wherefore
thus saith the Lord God; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose
scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it, bring it out
piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it. For her blood is in the midst
of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon
the ground, to cover it with dust; That it might cause fury to come
up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock,
that it should not be covered. Therefore thus saith the Lord God;
Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.
Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well,
and let the bones be burned. Then set it empty upon the coals
thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that
the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be
consumed. She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great
scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire. In
thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou
wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any
more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee. I the Lord
have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go
back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy
ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith
the Lord God (verses 1-14).

The Prophet is instructed to note the exact date, the tenth
day of the tenth month in the ninth year. The same date
we find in 2 Kings xxv:1. "And it came to pass in the ninth
year of his reign in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the
month, that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came, he,
and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it;
and they built forts against it round about." The same
statement is made by Jeremiah (chapter lii:4). But how did[161]
Ezekiel, far away from the scene of the siege, know the exact
date when the king of Babylon began to carry out the threatened
divine judgment? It was the Lord who gave him this
information. This is the statement of the second verse,
"Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this
selfsame day, the king of Babylon set himself (literally,
leaned upon) against Jerusalem this same day." Higher
Criticism shows its teeth in connection with such definite
statements which introduce the power of God. We quote
the following from a recent commentator: "This verse
(verse 2) forces on us in the clearest fashion the dilemma&mdash;either
Ezekiel was a deliberate deceiver, or he was possessed
of some kind of second sight." According to these
words Ezekiel was either an out-and-out deceiver, a wicked
man, or, he was a clairvoyant. That the word of the Lord
came to him and imparted unto him the news that on the
same day Jerusalem's siege had begun, is neither considered
nor believed. Such is the blind unbelief of the modern
critics. The boiling pot or caldron mentioned in this parable
is the symbol of Jerusalem. What is cast into this pot
typifies the guilty people; the choice bones and the choice
of the flock, the leaders. All are to be thrown in one common
caldron to seethe therein, the symbol of the fiery judgments
which had now come upon the city. The scum[16] in
the pot is symbolical of Jerusalem's sins. The woe is pronounced
upon the bloody city on account of the scum; it
is to be consumed. "She hath wearied Me with lies, and
her great scum went not forth out of her; her scum shall
be in the fire." While the inhabitants of the city are thus
described suffering for their sins, the city itself will be dealt
with (verse 11). This parable becomes still more interesting
if we compare it with the message of the eleventh chapter.[162]
Then the people of Jerusalem had said, "This city is
the caldron, and we be the flesh" (xi:3). The Lord had
answered them, "This city shall not be your caldron, within
shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof" (xi:11). They
gave the caldron a different meaning from the parable
here. As the flesh is preserved in a pot, a caldron, so they
thought themselves secure and safe in Jerusalem. And now
the Lord tells them that Jerusalem shall be a caldron, but
not for their preservation, but for their judgment. They
had deceived themselves when they thought themselves
safe. His fury is now to be displayed upon bloody, filthy
Jerusalem. "I the Lord have spoken it, it shall come to
pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare,
neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according
to thy doings shall they judge thee, saith the Lord God."
What the Lord hath spoken will come to pass; He will do
it. This is a solemn word. Men ignore what God has
spoken. Others sneer at it and are unbelieving. The mass
of professing Christians are indifferent and have no thought
that God will do what He has spoken about judgments to
come. But they will as surely come upon our age, as the
threatened judgments came upon Jerusalem.


II. The Death of the Wife of Ezekiel.

Also the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke:
yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run
down. Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind
the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy
feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men. So
I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died;
and I did in the morning as I was commanded (verses 15-18).

The second message which is given to Ezekiel in this
chapter concerns himself. He is to lose the desire of his
eyes, his wife, with a stroke. And the Lord tells him that[163]
he is not to mourn or weep, nor is he to shed tears on account
of the bereavement. All the customary signs of grief are
forbidden him. These were the taking off of the headdress,
the turban, and putting ashes on the head; taking off the
shoes, walking barefooted (2 Sam. xv:30); the covering of
the lips, the beard (Micah iii:7; see also Lev. xiii:45), and
the eating of certain food, mourning-food. All this he was
not to do. And while he faithfully delivered the Word of
the Lord in the morning, at even his wife was taken from
him and faithfully he obeyed the commandment of the
Lord. Death had dissolved the marriage union and taken
from the prophet the beloved wife. Even so the relationship
between Jehovah and Jerusalem was now to be completely
severed. And instead of a wild lamentation, a wailing
cry, there should be a solemn silence. A similar message
was also given to Jeremiah, "They shall die of grievous
deaths; they shall not be lamented.... For thus saith
the Lord, Enter not in the house of mourning, neither go to
lament nor bemoan them" (Jer. xvi:4-9).


III. The Question of the People and the Answer.

And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these
things are to us, that thou doest so? Then I answered them,
The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Speak unto the house
of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will profane my
sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes,
and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your
daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword. And ye
shall do as I have done; ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the
bread of men. And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your
shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall
pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.
Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done
shall ye do; and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the
Lord God. Also, thou son of man, shall it not be, in the day when
I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire
of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons[164]
and their daughters. That he that escapeth in that day shall come
unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears? In that day
shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt
speak, and be no more dumb; and thou shalt be a sign unto them;
and they shall know that I am the Lord (verses 19-27).

The people then inquired of Ezekiel about the meaning
of his actions. They wanted to know about the caldron
and about his strange behaviour in not mourning over the
death of his wife. The answer is again given by the Word
of the Lord. The captives on the river Chebar, who
surrounded the Prophet, hear now that the Lord is going to
profane His own sanctuary. It was the object in which
they boasted, the excellency of their strength and the desire
of their eyes. Their sons and daughters who had been left
behind by them were now to fall by the sword. As suddenly
as the stroke bereft him of his wife, so should they lose their
loved ones and they also were not to lament. Ezekiel was
unto them a sign. As previously so now again he foreshadowed
in his experience what was the common lot of
the people. But more than that should come upon them.
They were to pine away on account of their iniquities and
moan one toward another; their grief would be manifested
in groans and moans of deepest anguish. In all they were
to know that He whom they rejected is the Lord. And
so the world will make the same discovery before long, perhaps
even now this solemn fact is being demonstrated before
our eyes. Nations have forgotten God. They have rejected
His Word. They trampled under foot His truth and
the best the Lord has given. The measure of wickedness is
rapidly being filled up and God, a holy, righteous God, must
act in judgment and deal with man according to his ways
and according to his works. The moans and the groans are
on the earth.

And when all the prophet announced was accomplished,[165]
when Jerusalem had fallen, then one that escaped should
come to Ezekiel and tell him about it. Even so it happened.
"And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in
the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one
that had escaped out of Jerusalem came into me, saying,
The city is smitten" (xxxiii:21). It was also announced
to the Prophet that when this messenger came he should
no more be dumb, but his mouth should be opened, and he
would speak. Of this we read in chapter xxxiii:22; then
he would resume his public activities.


PREDICTIONS OF JUDGMENT AGAINST THE
NATIONS.

Chapters xxv-xxxii.


PREDICTIONS AGAINST AMMON, MOAB, EDOM
AND THE PHILISTINES.

Chapter xxv.

A new section begins with this chapter. The prophet is
now made the mouthpiece of Jehovah to utter prophecies
concerning other nations. Two years after the message
of the preceding chapter, the news came to Ezekiel announcing
the fall of the city and after that, Ezekiel received the
greater messages concerning Israel and her glorious future.
The prophecies contained in chapters xxv-xxxii concerning
the nations which came in touch with Israel were delivered
at different times. See the dates in chapters xxvi:1, xxix:1, 17,
xxx:20, xxxi:1 and xxxii:1, 17. The predictions concern just
seven nations, and these are divided into four and three.
The first four were the immediate neighbors of Israel. Then
come larger prophecies against Tyre, with a message on the
future return of Israel against Sidon and Egypt; Assyria is
also mentioned. Isaiah, Jeremiah and Amos likewise
received similar messages against the same nations. Their[166]
guilt is uncovered and their judgment and overthrow makes
the way for Israel's blessing and peace. While these judgments
have had a partial, past fulfilment, the complete
fulfilment is yet to come, for the prophetic Word shows
that the nations who have sinned against Jehovah and His
people will be judged in a coming day, when Israel will be
restored and be blest. Such is evident when we read the
gracious, still future promises to His earthly people. See
chapters xxviii:24-26 and xxix:21. These unfulfilled promises
concerning Israel's restoration as well as spiritual prosperity
make it clear that these judgments hold a definite relation
to future events.


I. The Prophecy Concerning Ammon.

The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, Son of man,
set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;
And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord God;
Thus saith the Lord God; Because thou saidst; Aha, against my
sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel,
when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they
went into captivity; Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men
of the East for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee,
and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they
shall drink thy milk. And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels,
and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know
that I am the Lord. For thus saith the Lord God; Because thou
hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced
in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel; Behold,
therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver
thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the
people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will
destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord (verses
1-7).

A message concerning Ammon had been given before to
Ezekiel (chapter xxi:28-32). The prophet Jeremiah also
announced the coming judgment for the Ammonites: "It
shall be a desolate heap and her daughters shall be burned[167]
with fire." But Jeremiah predicted a restoration of Ammon
after the judgment. "And afterward I will bring again
the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the Lord"
(Jer. lxix:1-6). God will accomplish this in His own time
and way. We do not need to trouble ourselves how He will
fulfil His Word; He takes care of that. Still another
prophet speaks concerning them. Zephaniah (ii:8-11) shows
that they reproached God's people and were filled with pride.
As we know, both Ammon and Moab had a deeply humiliating
origin (Gen. xix:37-38) and had a racial connection
with Israel. As the past history shows they were in constant
conflict with Israel. When the sanctuary in the
midst of God's people was profaned, the land laid desolate
and the house of Judah went into captivity, they greatly
rejoiced. Their exultation over Israel's sin and God's punishment
revealed their own wicked, God-defying, unbelieving
character. Therefore God is going to punish them. The
men of the East were to conquer them and take them for
a possession. The men of the East are the Bedouins. The
word "palaces" must be translated "encampments." The
Bedouins set up their tents in stone rings. And this prophecy
has been fulfilled. The Bedouin nomads wander through
Ammon's possession.


II. Prophecy Concerning Moab.

Thus saith the Lord God; Because that Moab and Seir do say,
Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen; Therefore,
behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities
which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth,
Baal-meon and Kiriathaim, Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites,
and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may
not be remembered among the nations. And I will execute judgments
upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the Lord
(verses 8-11).[168]

Moab was the kin of Ammon.[17] Their country lay east
of the Dead Sea. Other interesting prophetic messages
on Moab are contained in Isaiah xv and xvi; Jer. xlviii
and Amos ii:1. Jeremiah also gives a promise of Moab's
restoration. "Yet will I bring again the captivity of
Moab in the latter days, saith the Lord" (Jer. xlviii:47).
Here the time of Moab's blessing is stated; it will be "in
the latter days," the days still to come connected with the
day of the Lord, the second Coming of Christ. Where
Ammon and Moab are now, among what nations their descendants
exist, is known to an omniscient God. How
Moab will be brought back from captivity and installed in
their territory in the latter days, we repeat, will be accomplished
by the wisdom and power of God. The teaching
which one hears occasionally, that the Ammonites and
Moabites will be raised from the dead and restored physically
is more than a fanciful speculation; it is an evil,
unscriptural doctrine. The Word of God nowhere teaches
a physical resurrection of ungodly nations of the past
for a second chance. Moab also sneered at the house of
Judah and mockingly declared "the house of Judah is
like unto all the heathen." They were a proud and arrogant
people. "We have heard of the pride of Moab, he is
exceedingly proud, his loftiness and his arrogancy and his
pride and the haughtiness of his heart" (Jer. xlviii:29).
Isaiah gives the same description of their character (Isa.
xvi:6). And the God of Israel who governs the nations
and deals with them in judgment humbled them into the
dust. The Bedouins are now likewise the possessors of
their country. "And I will execute judgments upon Moab;
and they shall know that I am the Lord." And these judgments[169]
upon proud, self-exalting, God-forgetting nations, are
not confined to the past. Some nations of Europe, who
claimed to be nations of civilization and making for righteousness,
so often called "Christian nations," have been
lifted up in pride, forgetting God in their prosperity, and
now a righteous God has put His hand upon them, so that
they should find out that He is the Lord.


III. Prophecy Concerning Edom.

Thus saith the Lord God; Because that Edom hath dealt against
the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended,
and revenged himself upon them; Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut
off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman;
and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. And I will lay my
vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they
shall do in Edom according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance,
saith the Lord God (verses 12-14).

Edom, the descendants of Esau, the son of Jacob, was
more closely connected with Israel than Ammon and Moab.
And Edom's deeds were more pronouncedly against the
people of God, more wicked and defiant, than the others.
Israel was especially commanded not to abhor an Edomite.
"Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother"
(Deut. xxiii:7). They greatly offended and revenged themselves
upon them. Amos declared their sin. "He did
pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity,
and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath
forever" (Amos i:11). Edom's pride is uncovered by
Obadiah (Obd. verse 3-4), who also shows Edom's sin against
his brother (verses 10-14). And the cruel Herods, the
types of Antichrist, were Edomites. Edom's judgment is
to be executed by Israel. This is to take place in a future
day. See Obadiah's prophecy (verses 17-21) and Amos
ix:11-12). Yet judgment has long ago fallen upon Edom,[170]
as predicted in verse 14. What evidence that the words
spoken by these prophets are the words of God, supernatural
in their origin and sure in their fulfilment! We shall find
some striking evidences in the predictions uttered by Ezekiel
against Tyre and Egypt. There is a time coming when
every prediction in the Bible will be accomplished. Then
the Bible is gloriously vindicated and all its enemies will
forever disappear.


IV. Prophecy Concerning the Philistines.

Thus saith the Lord God; Because the Philistines have dealt by
revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to
destroy it for the old hatred; Therefore thus saith the Lord God;
Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will
cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea-coast.
And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes;
and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance
upon them (verses 15-17).

Another "thus saith the Lord." The Philistines dwelt
on a narrow strip on the seashore and were the long continued
enemies of the people Israel. Jeremiah speaks of
them (chapter cxlvii). See also Amos i:6-9; Joel iii:4;
Isa. xiv:29-32. The vengeance of the Lord fell upon the
coast of Palestina, the Philistines; and they experienced the
fury of the Lord. He dealt with them who had corrupted
His people. And so God will deal in due time with all His
enemies.


PROPHECIES CONCERNING TYRUS.

Chapter xxvi.

A lengthy prophecy concerning Tyre is contained in
this and the following chapters. It is of much interest.
The divinely given predictions against that once powerful
city have seen a literal fulfillment; certain periods of Tyre's
downfall and overthrow are made known by the prophet.[171]
History confirms all that is written here. In subsequent
chapters we find much information on the riches and the
greatness of that ancient city, while the description of the
King of Tyre, which fits only the prince of this world,
Satan, who governed Tyre's King, is of intense interest and
much importance. Here are also many spiritual lessons,
and a good deal which finds a ready application to present
day world-conditions.


I. The Overthrow of Tyrus Announced.

And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the
month, that the word of the Lord came unto me saying, Son of man,
because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha! she is broken
that was the gates of the people; she is turned unto me; I shall be
replenished, now she is laid waste: Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many
nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to
come up. And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break
down her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her, and make
her like the top of a rock. It shall be a place for the spreading of
nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord
God: and it shall become a spoil to the nations. And her daughters
which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall
know that I am the Lord. For thus saith the Lord God; Behold,
I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, a king
of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with
horsemen, and companies, and much people. He shall slay with
the sword thy daughters in the field; and he shall make a fort
against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler
against thee. And he shall set engines of war against thy walls,
and with his axes he shall break down thy towers. By reason of
the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls
shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of
the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a
city wherein is made a breach. With the hoofs of his horses shall
he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the
sword, and thy strong garrisons shall do down to the ground. And
they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise;
and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy[172]
pleasant houses; and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and
thy dust in the midst of the water. And I will cause the noise of
thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more
heard. And I will make thee like the top of a rock; thou shalt be
a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the
Lord have spoken it, saith the Lord God (verses 1-14).

The City of Tyrus (which means rock) was partly built
upon an island off the mainland in the Mediterranean Sea.
It was an ancient Phoenician city and is mentioned in Scripture
for the first time in Joshua xix:29, where it is called
"The strong city." It had a wonderful commerce, a description
of which in its variety, we find in the twenty-seventh
chapter. It was inhabited by seafaring men, and the
prophet Isaiah describes this wealthy and influential city
as "the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose
traffickers are the honorable of the earth" (Isaiah xxiii:8).
We read in the next chapter how Syria, Persia, Egypt,
Spain, Greece and every quarter of the ancient world laid
their choicest and most precious things at the feet of Tyre,
who sat enthroned on Ivory, covered with blue and purple
from the isles of Elishah. Her beauty was perfect (Ez.
xxvii:11). During the reign of David and Solomon, Tyre
came into great prominence, playing an important role
in the commercial, political and religious history of Israel.
Hiram, King of Tyrus sent cedar trees to Jerusalem, as well
as workmen, who built David a house (2 Sam. v:11). How
Tyrus aided in the construction of the temple and the
palace under Solomon's reign, may be learned by consulting
the following passages: 1 Kings v:1-12; vii:13-14; 1 Chronicles
xiv:1; 2 Chronicles ii:3, 11. When the ships of Solomon
sailed away to Ophir, "Hiram sent in the navy his servants,
ship-men that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants
of Solomon, and they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence
gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to
King Solomon" (1 Kings ix:27-28). The Tyrians were[173]
great voyagers, the masters of the sea, and founded colonies,
among them Carthage. Israel's close relations with Tyrus
continued probably for centuries. The wicked wife of
King Ahab, Jezebel, was the daughter of Ethbaal, King
of Tyre. She fostered successfully the vile Phoenician
idolatry among Israel. Tyre also sent messengers to
King Zedekiah, probably to form an alliance against the
approaching Babylonian conqueror (Jere. xxvii:3). She
was a proud, luxurious and wicked city, which defied God.
She sinned against Jerusalem and the people Israel. Joel
and Amos speak of her sins (Joel iii:4-6; Amos i:9-10)
and announced her judgment. So did the prophet Isaiah
(chapter xxiii) and Jeremiah (xlvii:4). Ezekiel gives us
the completest description of this city, her resources, her
luxuries and far reaching influence, her King under Satanic
control and also the details of her judgment.

In the third verse of our chapter we read the divine announcement
of Tyre's fate. "Behold I am against thee,
O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against
thee, as the sea causes its waves to come up. And they
shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers;
I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the
top of a rock." It was to become a place for the spreading
of nets and a spoil to the nations. This great judgment
was not all at once carried out. Nebuchadnezzar came
first against her as predicted in verses 7-11. He besieged
the Tyre on the mainland and after thirteen years took
the city; while that part of Tyrus which was built upon the
island in the sea, protected by the fleet of Tyrus, escaped.
Then came for her seventy years when she was forgotten,
as predicted by Isaiah (xxiii:15). After these years had
passed Tyrus saw a startling revival. The island city became
more powerful and wicked than before, "she committed
fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the[174]
face of the earth" (Is. xxiii:17). The continental Tyrus,
however, remained in ruins.

Centuries passed and it seemed as if Ezekiel's prophecy
concerning Tyre's complete overthrow would remain unfulfilled.
It was about 240 years after when the literal
fulfillment of this prophecy was accomplished. Alexander
the Great came against the city built on the island. After
seven months the city was taken by means of a mole, by
which the forces of Alexander could enter the city. In
constructing this mole, Alexander made use of the ruins
of the old city. The stones, timber and the very dust of
the destroyed city was laid into the sea to erect the causeway
which accomplished the utter ruin of the wealthy
city. And thus Ezekiel's prophecy was fulfilled. "And
they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust
in the midst of the water." The complete end of Tyrus had
come. "And thou shalt be no more, though thou be sought
for, yet shalt thou never be found again" (verse 21). So
completely was the work done by Alexander, depositing the
debris of the ruins of Tyrus on the mainland into the sea,
that its exact site will remain undeterminable. And Alexander
the Great fulfilled still another prophecy. Before
he came on his mission, directed by God, to make an end
of the proud and wicked city, Zechariah, the great post-exilic
prophet, had once more announced the fate of Tyrus.
"And Tyrus," said the Lord through Zechariah, "did build
herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and
fine gold as the ruin of the sheets." This was after Nebuchadnezzar
had destroyed the Tyrus on the mainland and
she became the great island city. "Thus," said Zechariah,
"behold, the Lord will cast her out, and He will smite her
power in the sea, and she shall be devoured with fire"
(Zech. ix:3-4). Alexander did this; he laid proud Tyrus
in ashes.[175]

What an evidence that all these words are the Word of
God! God looks to the fulfillment of all He revealed to
His prophets. It may appear often as if visions were in
vain and prophecies remain unaccomplished. God does
not need to be in a hurry; He can afford to take His time.
But finally every prophecy contained in the Holy Scriptures
will be fulfilled. Proud and boasting, like Tyrus, are the
great nations of our age. Wealth and luxuries are seen on
all sides and with it moral evil and every form of wickedness.
Judgment is surely in store for the nations that forget God.
As we know from the book of Revelation this present age
will culminate in the formation of Babylon the Great.
Much in Revelation xviii reminds us of Tyrus in this chapter
of Ezekiel and the next chapter.


II. The Effect of Tyre's Fall and the Lamentation.

Thus saith the Lord God to Tyrus; shall not the isles shake at
the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter
is made in the midst of thee? Then all the princes of the sea shall
come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put
off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with
trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at
every moment, and be astonished at thee. And they shall take up
a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed,
that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which
wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their
terror to be on all that haunt it! Now shall the isles tremble in the
day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled
at thy departure. For thus saith the Lord God; When I shall
make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited;
when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall
cover thee. When I shall bring thee down with them that descend
into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the
low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go
down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory
in the land of the living; I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt
be no more; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be
found again, saith the Lord God (verses 15-21).[176]

The isles and the princes of the sea were deeply affected
by her fall and overthrow. The princes came down from
their thrones and laid away their robes and trembled at
every moment. The lamentation they took up is on account
of the destruction of the renowned city. In Revelation
xviii we have a similar lament over the final Babylon,
the end in judgment of a godless, materialistic civilization.
(See Rev. xviii:9-19). Verses 19-20 give a description of
the descent of Tyre into the pit. "When I shall make
thee desolate, like the cities that are not inhabited; when
I shall bring up the deep unto thee, and great waters shall
cover thee; when I shall bring thee down with them that
descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall
set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of
old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not
inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living."
The last sentence, which is a promise of glory, can only refer
to the coming glory of the earthly Zion, the glory in store
for Israel. Boasting, proud Tyrus is laid in the dust;
her site completely blotted out. Other nations who hate
Israel and continue in the wickedness of those ancient
nations will also be broken to pieces, but Zion has a future
of glory. When the time of the judgment of the nations
comes God will set glory in Israel's land through the coming
of the King of Glory. We have already pointed out the
literal and startling fulfilment of the last verse of this
chapter.[177]


GLORIOUS TYRUS AND HER FALL.

Chapter xxvii.

"The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Now,
thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus." It is
an interesting description of the world-wide commerce and
glory of this once-proud world-city, which is given in this
chapter. "Sic transit gloria mundi"&mdash;thus passeth the glory
of the world; nothing but ruins instead of the wicked
mistress of the sea; yea, her very site is no longer known.
And what her glory was and how it passed away under divine
displeasure is made known through the inspired prophet.
Ezekiel certainly never saw Tyrus, nor did he have probably
any knowledge of her grandeur, her great wealth and far-reaching
commerce. But he was Jehovah's mouthpiece who
put into his lips and pen all these words.


I. The Glory of Tyrus.

The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, Now, thou Son
of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus. And say unto Tyrus,
O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant
of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord God; O Tyrus,
thou hast said, "I am of perfect beauty." Thy borders are in the
midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty. They
have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken
cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee. Of the oaks of
Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites
have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim.
Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou
spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of
Elisha was that which covered thee. The inhabitants of Zidon
and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O Tyrus, that were
in thee, were thy pilots. The ancients of Gebal and the wise men
thereof were in thee thy calkers; all the ships of the sea with their
mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise. They of Persia
and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war:
they hanged the shield and helmet in thee, they set forth thy comeliness.
The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls[178]
round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged
their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy
beauty perfect (verses 3-15).

The great city had her situation at the entry of the sea
and was the trader for the people of many isles. Lifted up
with pride, the powerful city boasted of perfect beauty.
"O Tyrus, thou has said, I am of perfect beauty." Beginning
with the fourth verse, we have a description of her as a
monster ship. The borders in the midst of the seas, the
builders perfecting her beauty. The shipboards, the masts
and the oars from the oaks of Bashan are mentioned. The
Ashurites made benches of ivory for this ship; the ivory was
brought from the isles of Chittim (Cyprus, etc.). Fine linen
and broidered work from Egypt she spread for sail. The
inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were the sailors and her
wise men pilots. It is all in the form of an allegory. Tyrus
also had an army gathered from different nations.

Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all
kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy
fairs. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants:
they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.
They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses
and horsemen and mules. The men of Dedan were thy merchants;
many isles were the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee
for a present horns of ivory and ebony. Syria was thy merchant
by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied
in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work,
and fine linen, and coral, and agate. Judah, and the land of
Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat
of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm. Damascus
was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making for
the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.
Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright
iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market. Dedan was thy
merchant in precious clothes for chariots. Arabia, and all the
princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams,
and goats: in these were they thy merchants. The merchandise[179]
of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they occupied in
thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and
gold. Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba,
Asshur, and Chilmad, were thy merchants. These were thy
merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work,
and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar,
among thy merchandise. The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in
thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious
in the midst of the seas (verses 16-25).

The commerce of Tyrus is next vividly described. The
description begins with Tarshish, then of great renown, and
ends with mentioning the ships of Tarshish. And what are
the articles of commerce mentioned? Silver, iron, tin,
lead, slaves, vessels of brass, horses and mules. Then
there were horns of ivory and ebony; emeralds, purple
and broidered work, fine linen, coral and agate. Wheat of
Minni and Pannag, honey, oil and balm; wine of Helbon
and white wool. Then follow other articles of commerce:
bright iron, cassia, calamus and precious cloths for chariots.
They also traded in live stock: lambs and rams, and goats,
besides spices, precious stones, gold chests of rich apparel,
etc. Thus she was replenished and made glorious in the midst
of the seas. Another world-city or system is described in
the last book of the Bible, Babylon the great; the articles
of her world-wide commerce are also given (Rev. xviii:12-13);
it is much like the commerce of ancient Tyrus. Tyrus is a
picture of a great world-city: rich, increased in goods,
enjoying prosperity and filled with pride. As she passed
away with all her glory, so others have crumbled into dust.
Equally so will this present Godless civilization, culminating
in Babylon the great, pass away under the judgment-stroke
of God (Rev. xviii:15-19).


II. The Description of the Fall of Tyrus.

Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind
hath broken thee in the midst of the seas. Thy riches, and thy[180]
fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers,
and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that
are in thee, and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee,
shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin. The
suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. And all
that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall
come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;
And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry
bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow
themselves in the ashes: And they shall make themselves utterly
bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep
for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing. And in their
wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over
thee, saying. What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the
midst of the sea? When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou
filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with
the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. In the time
when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters
thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall
fail. All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee,
and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their
countenance. The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee;
thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more (verses 26-30).

The description of Tyrus as a ship as given in the first part
of this chapter is here maintained. Tyrus is to be shipwrecked.
The east wind is Nebuchadnezzar, who came against
the proud city to accomplish part of her ruin; and Alexander
the Great, as we saw in our previous study, completed the
work. A comparison with Revelation xviii will bring out the
striking correspondency. When finally Babylon the great
falls, that coming religious-commercial world-system, with
Rome as a center, her fall and desolation, will surely be
greater than the fall of Tyrus. For this all is rapidly preparing.[181]


THE PRINCE OF TYRUS.

Chapter xxviii.

The greater part of this chapter is also devoted to Tyrus.
This concluding prophecy about Tyrus is the most interesting.
It concerns the proud ruler of that city, who is
called Prince and also King. But this ruler as Prince and
King is typical of another and more sinister being as we learn
from this chapter. Tyrus with its earthly glory, wealth
and pride, as pointed out in the previous expositions, is
the type of the glory of the world, the commercial glory
and all connected with it, and clearly foreshadows the
final great commercial world-system, Babylon the Great.
Inasmuch then as Tyrus foreshadows this, its proud and
wicked King is typical of the prince of this world, the
one who fell by pride and who is the ruler and god of this
age. As the prince of this world he showed to the Lord
Jesus Christ all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,
and offered all to the Lord. This sinister being and his
coming masterpiece, the Antichrist, who is to rule during the
end of this age on the earth, are foreshadowed in a striking
way in the ruler of Tyrus.


I. The Prince of Tyrus, his Pride and his Doom.

The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying: Son of man,
say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord God; Because
thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the
set of God, in the midst of the seas, yet thou art a man, and not God,
though thou set thine heart as the heart of God: Behold thou art
wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee.
With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten
thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures.
By thy great wisdom and by thy traffic thou hast increased thy
riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches. Therefore
thus saith the Lord God; Because thou hast set thine heart
as the heart of God; Behold therefore, I will bring strangers upon
thee, the terrible of the nations, and they shall draw their swords[182]
against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.
They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the
deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. Wilt thou
yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be
a man and no god, in the hand of him that slayeth thee. Thou
shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers;
for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God (verses 1-10.)

The Prince of Tyrus who ruled in the days of Ezekiel was,
according to the Jewish historian Josephus, Ithobalus, called
in the Phoenecian annals Ithobaal II. The description of
this character tells us that he was the consummation of the
pride and wealth of Tyrus; the awful pride of that city was
headed up in him. His heart was so lifted up that he claimed
to be a god and that he occupied the seat of God. He also
boasted of wisdom greater than the wisdom of Daniel, the
captive in Babylon. By his cunning and wisdom, as well as
by traffic, he had heaped up riches, and because of these
riches he became still more lifted up. Like the prosperous
and wealthy king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, who gloried
in his achievements by saying, "Is not this great Babylon,
that I have built for the house of the Kingdom by the might
of my power, and for the honor of my majesty" (Dan. iv:30),
the Prince of Tyrus boasted in arrogant pride. Through
the prophet, his doom is announced. The Lord God reckons
with him, "because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of
God." He would bring nations against him and his city, and
"they shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shall die
the deaths of them that are slain in the heart of the seas."
Instead of having endless being as a god he would die a
sudden and violent death. He should die the death of the
uncircumcised, typifying vile and wicked men who are
far away from God; dying deaths, which means a physical
death and that which follows the wicked after death, an
eternal separation from God, with conscious punishment.

The language used in describing the Prince of Tyrus is[183]
used elsewhere in the Word of God to describe another one,
who is yet to come. We mean the personal Antichrist,
the man of sin. The marks of this coming one, Satan's
great counterfeit and masterpiece, are always pride, self-exaltation.
Daniel describes him in the following words:
"And the King shall do according to his will; and he shall
exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall
speak marvelous things against the God of gods"[18] (Dan.
xi:36). In the New Testament the coming Antichrist is
pictured as follows: "Who opposeth and exalteth himself
above all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he
as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that
he is God" (2 Thess. ii:4). Comparing these statements
with what is said of the Prince of Tyrus we see at once the
similarity. The political head of the final form of the times
of the Gentiles, the ten Kingdom Empires, the Roman Empire
revived, is described in very much the same way. The
man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake the
Kingdoms (Isaiah xiv:16) said in his heart, "I will ascend into
heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God ...
I will be like the Most High" (Is. xiv:13-14). Here is the
same characteristic, a God-defying pride. This has led many
expositors to call both of these persons, the wicked actors
during the end of the age, the Antichrist. But the one is
the head of the Roman Empire, the Prince that shall come;
the other is the Antichrist, the beast out of the earth
(Rev. xiii:11). Both work together under Satan's control
and are energized by Satan, therefore they manifest the[184]
same characteristics. It is evident that the ruler of Tyrus
as Prince foreshadows the coming Antichrist, and we have
to see next the significance that the ruler of Tyrus is addressed
as King and the one who stands behind him.


II. The Lamentations over the King of Tyrus.

Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of
man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto
him, Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full of
wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden
of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz,
and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire,
the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy
tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou
wast created. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and
I have set thee so; thou was upon the holy mountain of God;
thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created,
till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise
they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou
hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain
of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the
midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy
beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness:
I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings,
that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by
the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick;
therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour
thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight
of all them that behold thee. All they that know thee among the
people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never
shalt thou be any more (verses 11-19).

The Prince and the King are identical, and not different
persons as some say. But what is said now of the ruler of
Tyrus as king could never be said of a mere human being.
Hardly any of the descriptions given in these verses can be
applied to the heathen King of Tyrus. The description fits
another being, the person who was originally the greatest[185]
and most beautiful creature of God, but has become a
fallen creature and the enemy of God. In one word, it is
Satan in his original greatness and in his fall who is revealed
in connection with the King of Tyrus. Satan was the power
behind the throne of the Tyrian King, as Satan is still the
god of this age who controls the kingdoms of the world.
Inasmuch, then, as Tyrus is a type of the commercial glory
of the world, its wealth and pride, foreshadowing the final
great world-city or world-system, Babylon, the ruler of
Tyrus, spoken of as Prince, foreshadows the Antichrist,
while as King, Satan himself stands behind him as the domineering
power. The descriptions given of Satan as an unfallen
being, show that he was originally a marvelous being,
full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. From Jude's epistle we
learn that even Michael still recognized in him the grandeur
of his unfallen past and did not bring a railing accusation
against him (Jude verses 8-10). He was in Eden, the garden
of God, and every precious stone was his covering. It
is a description of Satan's original place and of his great
beauty. Furthermore, he was the anointed cherub that
covereth; the Lord had set him to be this. As the anointed,
divinely chosen cherub he held an exalted position in connection
with the government of the throne of God.[19] Everything
shows that this majestic creature possessed a place of
great dignity, being "upon the holy mountain of God,"
walking up and down in the midst of the stones of fire, he
was ever present and moving about in the fiery glory of a
holy and righteous God. "Thou was perfect in thy ways
from the day that thou wast created till unrighteousness
was found in thee." Surely the first part of this verse could
never apply to the King of Tyrus nor to any other human;[186]
it is a picture of the unfallen glorious creature of God. But
unrighteousness was found in him. He sinned, and as a
result divine sentence is pronounced upon him. Yet this
sentence in verse 16 is not yet executed. He is not yet
cast out in the fullest sense, nor bruised completely, nor is
he in the lake of fire. All this is future. God in His all-wise
purpose delays the complete execution of this judgment.
But the day will come when he, who walked once in the
presence of the glory of God, in the midst of the stones of
fire, will be cast into the lake of fire, his eternal abode.
What was his sin? "Thy heart was lifted up because of
thy beauty; thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of
thy brightness." He became puffed up, lifted up with pride
(1 Tim. iii:6) on account of his own beauty and brightness.
There can be no question, but the person so closely linked
with the King of Tyrus is Satan. The passage contains
one of the most interesting revelations we have in the Bible
on the person and dignity of that fallen being. Verses 18
and 19 show that the King is in view and the fate of his city
Tyrus: "I have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the
sight of all them that behold thee."


III. A Prophecy Concerning Zidon.

Again the word of the Lord came unto me saying: Son of man, set
thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it. And say, Thus
saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will
be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the
Lord, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be
sanctified in her. For I will send into her pestilence, and blood
into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of
her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that
I am the Lord. And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto
the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about
them, that despiseth them; and they shall know that I am the Lord
God. Thus saith the Lord God; When I shall have gathered the
house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered,
and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall[187]
they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.
And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant
vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have
executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about
them; and they shall know that I am the Lord (verses 20-26).

Zidon (or Sidon) was situated twenty miles north of
Tyrus. Like Tyrus she was built offshore on island rocks.
For many years Zidon was even more prominent and prosperous
than Tyrus. She was burnt after a revolt against
Artaxerxes Ochus, 351 B. C., but later rebuilt. See its mention
in the New Testament in Mark iii:8, vii:24. Jehovah
announces that He would execute judgments in Zidon and
thus be glorified and sanctified in her. When a holy God
deals in judgments with sin, with individuals and nations,
He maintains thereby His holy character. He is light in
whom there is no darkness at all and a consuming fire. It
has been said that there is no special transgression mentioned
why Zidon should be judged. No doubt she was as proud
as her sister city Tyrus. But verse 24 tells us the reason;
she was a pricking brier to the house of Israel. She sinned
against her neighbor, the people of God, and for that judgment
came on her. And so can present-day nations not
escape judgment for their sins against the Jews. The last
two verses are a prophecy relating to Israel's restoration.
Needless to say up to this time their restoration has not
taken place. The time is given when it will come, when the
Lord executes judgment upon the nations. When our Lord
comes again these judgments will fall. And how near all
this must be when we behold nations filling full the
measure of their wickedness and the Jews as a suffering
people with faces turned towards their homeland.[188]


PROPHECIES CONCERNING EGYPT.

Chapter xxix.

The predictions about Tyrus and Zidon are followed by the
prophecies against Egypt. These prophecies are of even
greater interest than those preceding. First Pharaoh and
Egypt are addressed; the coming judgment and the desolation
of the land is announced. A restoration after forty
years is promised when the captivity of Egypt is to be brought
again; but the former glory will be departed and Egypt's
decline, to be the basest of the kingdoms, is predicted. The
King of Babylon is announced as the conqueror of Egypt
(chapter xxix). In chapter xxx the destruction of Egypt, her
people and her allies, is vividly described; at the close of this
chapter the defeat of Pharaoh by Nebuchadnezzar is predicted.
In chapter xxxi the King of Egypt is described as a
mighty cedar; its fall is foretold as well as the effect of
Pharaoh's fall among the nations. Chapter xxxii contains a
lamentation over the King of Egypt. In the second half of
this chapter, the concluding section of these prophecies
against Egypt, we find a solemn dirge over the doomed
people. The unseen regions are unveiled and those who
enjoyed earthly honors and glory are seen in the place of dishonor,
misery and shame.


I. The Prediction of Egypt's Desolation.

In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the
month, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, set
thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him,
and against all Egypt: Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord God;
Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon
that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is
mine own, and I have made it for myself. But I will put hooks in
thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy
scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all
the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales. And I will leave[189]
thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers:
thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together,
nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the
field and to the fowls of the heaven. And all the inhabitants of
Egypt shall know that I am the Lord, because they have been a staff
of reed to the house of Israel. When they took hold of thee by thy
hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they
leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a
stand. Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will bring
a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee. And
the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know
that I am the Lord: because he hath said, The river is mine, and
I have made it. Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against
thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and
desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.
No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass
through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. And I will
make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that
are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste
shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among
the nations, and will disperse them through the countries
(verses 1-12).

The King of Egypt addressed in this prophecy was Pharaoh-Hophra,
called in Greek, Apries. He was the grandson
of Pharaoh-Necho who defeated King Josiah at Meggido
(2 Chronicles xxxv:20-27). King Zedekiah of Judah expected
help and relief from Pharaoh-Hophra, when Jerusalem was
besieged. The Egyptian army under Hophra advanced
through Phoenicia and forced the Chaldeans to raise the siege
of Jerusalem (Jer. xxxvii:5-7). But the relief was only temporary,
for the Egyptian army had to retire. The prophet
Jeremiah announced also the doom of Hophra, associating it
with Zedekiah's doom: "Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will
give Pharaoh-Hophra, King of Egypt, into the hands of his
enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I
gave Zedekiah, King of Judah, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar,
King of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life"
(Jer. xliv:30).[190]

Here he is called "the great dragon that lieth in the midst
of his rivers." He boasts, "My river is mine own and I have
made it for myself." The river Nile, with its different
branches is meant. Pharaoh is compared to a sea monster,
which probably means the crocodile, worshipped by the
Egyptians; it was symbolical of power and pride.[20] But the
word "dragon" also reminds us of Satan who is called twelve
times in the Book of Revelation the dragon. As we learned
from the previous chapter, behind the King of Tyrus stood
Satan as master of the great city, and the same being, the
dragon, controlled also Pharaoh-Hophra and the land of
Egypt. The dragon was worshipped by many ancient nations
and is still today the emblem of the Chinese Empire. And the
same ungodly self-exaltation which characterized Tyrus and
its king, which led to its overthrow and judgment, was shared
by the King of Egypt. Proud and blasphemous were his
words that he had made the river for himself; he defied God
and refused to own his power. Therefore, his judgment is announced
which would not alone strike him but all the other
inhabitants of the land and all who looked to Egypt for help.
"I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the
fish of thy rivers (the people of the land); thou shalt fall upon
the open field; thou shalt not be brought together nor
gathered. I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the
field and to the fowls of the heaven." It is a striking
allegory. In verses 6 and 7 Israel's sin is mentioned when
the people of God turned to this wicked land for help, the
land where their forefathers had groaned and suffered such
cruelty. Isaiah had solemnly warned against such an alliance
(Isaiah xxx:6-7; xxxi:3) and so had Jeremiah (Jer. ii:36;
xxxvii:7). Interesting it is to find that the same illustration[191]
of disaster for Israel by trusting in Egypt had been used by
the Assyrian officer in addressing Hezekiah: "Now, behold,
thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, upon Egypt,
on which, if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce
it; so is Pharaoh, King of Egypt, unto all that trust on
him" (2 Kings xviii:21). And so it was. Egypt gave no
help to Israel and only wounded them grievously as a staff
which breaks under the weight of him who leaneth upon it&mdash;breaks
and pierces the hand. Whenever God's people turn
to Egypt (the type of the world) for help and form ungodly
alliances they do so to their own hurt and shame.

Then follows the explanation of the allegory and, once
more, the reason of the coming desolation of Egypt is stated,
because the proud King had said, "The river is mine, and I
have made it." The entire land of Egypt was to be wasted
from one end to the other. It was to become desolate and
for the period of forty years it was not to be inhabited. "And
I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the
countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities
that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years, and I will
scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse
them through the countries" (verse 12).

But have these predictions been fulfilled? Did Egypt
pass through a period of forty years' desolation and did a
restoration take place after the forty years? Critics claim
that these predictions were never literally fulfilled and that
Nebuchadnezzar did not invade Egypt during the reign of
Hophra. They point to the historical evidence that Amasis
followed Hophra as King of Egypt, and under his reign
Egypt was in a very flourishing condition. The historian,
Herodotus, gives this information and it is fully confirmed
by Egyptian records on monuments. But did the prophet
Ezekiel predict that Egypt should be invaded by Nebuchadnezzar
during the reign of Pharaoh-Hophra? He predicts[192]
that Nebuchadnezzar should conquer Egypt, but the critics
have made a serious blunder by overlooking the date of the
prophecy in which Nebuchadnezzar's invasion is announced.
The chapter under our consideration begins with a definite
date. It was in the tenth year when he received the message
concerning Hophra; but it was seventeen years later when
Nebuchadnezzar's invasion was predicted, in the twenty-seventh
year (verse 17). Hophra's doom and the desolation
of Egypt was first announced, but the fulfillment came years
later. Ezekiel does not state that Hophra should be slain by
Nebuchadnezzar, nor does Jeremiah predict this (Jeremiah
xliv:30). Hophra was dethroned by Amasis and later slain.


II. Egypt's Restoration and Future as a Kingdom.

Yet thus saith the Lord God; At the end of forty years will I
gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:
and I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to
return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation;
and they shall be there a base kingdom. It shall be the basest
of the kingdoms, neither shall it exalt itself any more above the
nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over
the nations. And it shall be no more the confidence of the house
of Israel, which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they
shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord God
(verses 13-16).

The future of Egypt after its desolation of forty years is
revealed in this paragraph. Nebuchadnezzar's conquest of
Egypt follows in the next paragraph. The forty years of
desolation, during which the Egyptians were dispersed in
different countries are difficult to locate historically. Some
apply them altogether to the future. B. W. Newton, in his
"Babylon and Egypt," claims that all this will be accomplished
in the future. We quote his words: "It will be
fearfully smitten; and for forty years after the Millennium
has commenced, it will be utterly desolate. No foot of man
shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it,[193]
neither shall it be inhabited forty years (Ezekiel xxix:11).
But, finally, it shall be revived, and together with Israel and
Assyria shall receive that wondrous blessing which the concluding
verses of the nineteenth of Isaiah describe."[21] That
Egypt will have a future of blessing no careful student of the
prophetic Word will deny. Isaiah xix shows its future history,
both in judgment and in blessing. Yet the prediction
of Ezekiel that Egypt after the forty years of desolation
should be the basest of all kingdoms and shall have no more
rule, but be in a diminished condition, excludes the application
of this prophecy to the coming Millennium. Egypt had
such a period of forty years' devastation, though the exact
history of it may not be known to us. Prophecy is not
learned by historical events, but history is revealed in
prophecy. We believe prophecies, not because history has
measured up to them, but we believe them because they are
the inerrant Word of God. After Egypt's sorrowful forty
years' experience and dispersion, this proud country went
into a steady decline, and the Word of God was literally fulfilled
when it became the basest of kingdoms, so that Israel
put confidence no longer in Egypt. After Nebuchadnezzar's
raid, Egypt declined and sank lower still under the Persians
and the Ptolemies, until she became the granary of Rome.
And this degradation has continued throughout the centuries
of this age so that Egypt is literally the basest of the kingdoms.[22]
That she will play her part in the future at the close
of our age we learn from Daniel's prophecy (Dan. xi:36-45).
Egypt will rise into prominence ere long in connection with
the present day world conflict.

[194]
III. The Conquest of Nebuchadnezzar.

And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first
month, in the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came unto
me, saying, Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused
his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was
made bald and every shoulder was peeled: yet he had no wages,
nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against
it. Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will give the land
of Egypt unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take
her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be
the wages for his army. I have given him the land of Egypt for
his labor wherewith he served against it, because they wrought
for me, saith the Lord God. In that day will I cause the horn of the
house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the
mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the
Lord (verses 17-21).

As already stated, this prophecy is dated seventeen years
after the general prediction of Egypt's judgment. That
Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt after he came against
Tyrus is mentioned by Josephus the Jewish historian and
also by an Assyrian inscription which gives the record of
this campaign as having taken place in the thirty-seventh
year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar.[23] Nothing is said of
desolation and captivity in this later prophecy concerning
Egypt's conquest. Critics claim that Ezekiel had made a
mistake in his former prediction. We quote from the New
Century Bible: "Ezekiel evidently saw that his former
prophecy was mistaken, and he now expected the defeat,
though not necessarily the utter destruction, of Egypt. The
difference in detail is noticeable between these verses and the
prophecy on Egypt seventeen years earlier." But Ezekiel
was not mistaken. There was no need of repeating the predicted[195]
desolation of Egypt; Nebuchadnezzar executed the
work of judgment. He suffered, evidently, disappointment
in the siege of Tyrus, the immense wealth of that city he
could not touch. And, as he did not get wages from Tyrus,
nor for his great army, the Lord, whose instrument in judgment
the King of Babylon was, gave him Egypt. Here
Nebuchadnezzar found great spoil and vast treasures, which,
according to divine appointment, were the wages for his
army. When this took place, there came an unrecorded
revival in Israel and the prophet gave his message in the
midst of them.


EGYPT'S FUTURE DESOLATION.

Chapter xxx.

The destruction of Egypt and her allies is now revealed
to the prophet. It is a remarkable prophecy for the predictions
concerning the humiliation and desolation of
Egypt, the once powerful nation of culture, have found a
most interesting fulfillment. The leading cities of Egypt
are mentioned, which have long ago been wasted and their
magnificent temples have crumbled into dust. In the
second half of this chapter the King of Babylon as the
executioner of the decrees of God is seen. The sword of
judgment was put into Nebuchadnezzar's hand by God,
so that he might stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.


I. The Desolation of Egypt and her Allies.

The word of the Lord came again unto me saying: Son of man
prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Howl ye, alas for the
day! For the day is near, even the day of the Lord is near, a cloudy
day; it shall be the time of the heathen. And the sword shall
come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the
slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude,
and her foundations shall be broken down. Ethiopia, and Libya,
and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men[196]
of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
Thus saith the Lord; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall;
and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of
Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord God. And
they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate,
and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are
wasted. And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have
set a fire in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed. In
that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the
careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them,
as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh. Thus saith the Lord
God: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand
of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon. He and his people with him,
the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land:
and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land
with the slain. And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into
the hand of the wicked; and I will make the land waste, and all that
is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the Lord have spoken it
(verses 1-13).

The prophet's first utterance is concerning the day.
"Howl ye! Alas for the day! For the day is near,[24] even
the day of the Lord is near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time
of the Gentiles." What day is this? Other prophets
mention the day of Jehovah as a day of judgment and wrath
when the Lord will deal in His righteousness with the nations
of the earth. See Isaiah ii; xiii:6, 9; Joel i:15; ii:1, 11;
iii:14; Amos v:18, 20; Obad. 15; Zeph. i:7, 14; Zech.
xiv:1, etc. This day in its final meaning is the day on which
the Lord Jesus Christ will be visibly revealed from heaven.
It is mentioned in the New Testament in 1 Thess. v:2;
2 Thess. ii:2 (where "day of Christ" should be rendered
"day of the Lord") and 2 Peter iii:10. This day will bring
"man's day" to a close and usher in a new age, when righteousness
shall reign as grace reigns now. This day of coming[197]
judgment of all nations is seen also here in a prophetic
perspective. All previous judgments of nations as announced
by God's prophets, nations which sinned against Israel the
chosen people, foreshadow the one great day, when the
times of the Gentiles end in the revealed manner (Dan.
ii:34; vii:10-14). What came upon Egypt in the past
through divine judgment will happen to the Gentile nations
in the future at the close of our age, "when the Lord Jesus
shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in
flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not
God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ"
(2 Thess. i:7-8). Ever since the times of the Gentiles began
with Nebuchadnezzar the divinely appointed head (Jeremiah
xxvii:4-8) this day of the Lord has been drawing near, till
now with the stupendous present day events, we can see
this day rapidly approaching.

The sword was to fall upon Egypt as well as upon Ethiopia,
Libya and Lydia (Hebrew: Phut and Lud, see xxvii:10), and
all others who were in league with them. Her foundations
were to be broken down and the pride of her power shall
come down. All this has come to pass and for many centuries
the once powerful and proud Egypt has thus been
broken down. From Migdol to Syene (not from the tower
of Syene) were they to fall by the sword of the Lord. Verse
7 shows the wide sweep of the judgment, covering the
surrounding countries. "And they shall be desolate in the
midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall
be in the midst of the cities that are wasted." Their desolation
was to be a desolation in the midst of desolations.
It has come literally true. The surrounding countries
shared the desolation of the land itself. She has been rightly
called "the land of ruins," a vast burial place of the art,
architecture and glory of the past, and her present towns
(except Alexandria which cannot be reckoned among the[198]
ancient cities, as it was unknown to the Pharaohs) are, as
it were, dwellings among the tombs.

Another remarkable prophecy is found in verse 12: "And
I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand
of the wicked, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers.
I the Lord have spoken it." Isaiah also predicted, "The
waters shall fail from the sea and the river shall be wasted
and become dry" (Isaiah xix:5). The rivers are evidently
the many arms of the Nile forming the Delta. This
is the case today, and has been so in past centuries, and the
arms of the Nile, instead of flowing in their original courses
have become ill-smelling pools and marshes. And so was
the land sold into the hand of the wicked. Untold sufferings,
slavery, outrages of many kinds has been the record of
Egypt in its past history.


II. The Destruction of the Cities.

Thus saith the Lord God: I will also destroy the idols, and I will
cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a
prince of the land of Egypt; and I will put a fear in the land of
Egypt. And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan,
and will execute judgments in No. And I will pour my fury upon
Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall
be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily. The young
men of Aven and of Phi-beseth shall fall by the sword; and these
cities shall go into captivity. At Tehaphnehes also the day shall
be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the
pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall
cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. Thus will
I execute judgments in Egypt; and they shall know that I am the
Lord (verses 13-19).

Their idols and images were to be destroyed so as to reveal
their nothingness. So it was many centuries before when
Israel was in the house of bondage and the power of God
in judgment exposed the things which the Egyptians worshipped.[199]
Noph, which is mentioned in verse 13, is Memphis.
Memphis was the prominent seat of the worship of Ptah and
Apis. It was the great temple city, founded by Menes.
What has become of this marvellous city with its magnificient
temple structures and carved, colossal images and idols?

Abd-ul-Latif, an Arab traveller, who visited it in the
thirteenth century, says: "Its ruins still offer to the eyes of
the spectator a collection of wonderful works which confound
the intellect, and to describe which the most eloquent
man would labor in vain. The longer we look upon the
scene, the higher rises the admiration it inspires; and
every new glance that we cast upon the ruins reveals a
new charm. Scarcely have they awakened a distinct idea
in the soul of the spectator, than a still more admirable
idea suggests itself; and just as you believe you have
gained complete knowledge of them, at that very moment
the conviction forces itself on the mind, that what you
think you know is still very far from the truth."

But even the magnificent ruins, the mute witnesses of
a past glory, are gone. The very site of Noph (Memphis)
is now a matter of dispute. Only a few immense carved
stones remain in the desert sand. Temples, idols and
images are forever gone. The prophet Ezekiel knew undoubtedly
of the far-famed city, its influence and power
in the religious life of Egypt. How could he announce
such utter ruin for that city unless the Lord had revealed it
to him and put His own words into his mouth? What a
great evidence prophecy is that the Bible is the Word of
God! "No," mentioned three times in verses 14-16, is
Thebes, the ancient capital of Egypt, called by the Greeks
"Diospolis," the City of Jupiter. "No" is also mentioned
by Nahum (iii:8). Her ruins bear witness of a past, indescribable
splendor. The great Temple of Carnac was
there. An authority saith: "The ruins of the temple of[200]
Carnac is the largest and most splendid ruin of which,
perhaps, either ancient or modern times can boast. All
here is sublime, all majestic. With pain one tears oneself
from Thebes. Her monuments fix the traveller's eyes and
fill his mind with vast ideas. Beholding colossal figures and
stately obelisks which seem to surpass human powers."
What a city No, Thebes the capital, must have been! The
Lord alone could foretell that it should be rent asunder.
The ruins bear witness that God's message was faithfully
delivered by Ezekiel. And so was fulfilled, "There shall be no
more a prince out of the land of Egypt." No native prince
has had complete rule over the land. The other places
mentioned are Sin, which is Pelusium, now completely
buried in the sand. Aven is Heliopolis, the center of the
worship of Ba, the god of the sun. Pi-beseth is Bubastis,
where the sacred cats were mummied, likewise a desolation
now. Tehaphnehes or Daphnis also passed through the
judgment. What a remarkable fulfillment of what the Lord
announced through His servant Ezekiel! May we here be
reminded in our solemn times that the same omniscient
Lord, who knows the end from the beginning, has spoken
concerning this age, now closing in its predicted apostasy.
Nations today steeped in bloodshed; nations filled with
covetousness and hatred; an apostate professing Christendom
and the indifferent masses have written over against
them the judgment-wrath of the coming King. And He
who fulfilled the words spoken through Ezekiel will also
fulfill every other prediction uttered by His Holy prophets
and apostles.


III. The Work of Nebuchadnezzar.

And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the
seventh day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me,
saying, Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of
Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller[201]
to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword. Therefore thus
saith the Lord God: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt,
and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken;
and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. And I will
scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them
through the countries. And I will strengthen the arms of the king
of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand; but I will break Pharaoh's
arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a
deadly-wounded man. But I will strengthen the arms of the king
of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall
know that I am the Lord, when I shall put my sword into the hand
of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of
Egypt. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and
disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I
am the Lord (verses 20-26).

The arm of Pharaoh, King of Egypt was to be broken
completely. No bandage would suffice to make it strong
again to hold the sword. It was a break beyond remedy.
Jeremiah had received a similar message. "Go up into
Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt,
in vain shalt thou use many medicines, for thou shalt not be
cured" (Jere. xlvi:11). And Jeremiah also announced
that Nebuchadnezzar should be used in carrying out the
overthrow of Egypt. "The word that the Lord spake to
Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon,
should come and smite the land of Egypt. Declare
ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph
and in Tehaphnehes, say ye, Stand fast and prepare thee,
for the sword shall devour round about thee" (Jere. xlvi:13-17).
Nebuchadnezzar wielded the sword of the Lord.
"And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall put
my sword into the hand of the King of Babylon, and he
shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt." The sovereign
God had not only used the King of Babylon to execute His
judgments upon Jerusalem, but He had also given other
lands into his hands and made him the head of the times[202]
of the Gentiles, typified in his great dream-image by the
head of gold. "And now have I given all these lands into
the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon my
servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also
to serve him. And all nations shall serve him and his
son and his son's son, until the very time of his land come,
and then many nations and great Kings shall serve themselves
of him" (Jere. xxvii:5-7). The times of the Gentiles
are still in force, and when they end Egypt will pass through
another judgment to receive afterward the blessings promised
through the prophet Isaiah (Is. xix:18-25).


PHARAOH'S GREATNESS AND HIS OVERTHROW.

Chapter xxxi.

Two more chapters speak of the downfall and judgment
of Egypt. First, the fall of Pharaoh is described in a parable
and then follows the lamentations, a funeral dirge over
Pharaoh. The message of the thirty-first chapter has three
well defined parts. The King of Egypt, like the Assyrian
of the past, is pictured as a great cedar in Lebanon. Then
the fall of the tree is shown, and finally the shaking of the
nations on account of his fall.


II. The Greatness and Glory of the King of Egypt.

And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month,
in the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto
me, saying, Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to
his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness? Behold, the
Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a
shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among
the thick boughs. The waters made him great, the deep set him
up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent
out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field. Therefore his
height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs
were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude
of waters, when he shot forth. All the fowls of heaven made[203]
their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts
of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt
all great nations. Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length
of his branches: for his root was by great waters. The cedars
in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like
his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches;
nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.
I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all
the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him
(verses 1-9).

The Lord commands the prophet to ask a question of
Pharaoh and his multitude: "Whom art thou like in thy
greatness?" Then the divine questioner answers and reveals
the greatness and glory of Pharaoh. He uses the
Assyrian in his past greatness to describe Pharaoh's greatness
and glory. Some have applied the prophecy entirely
to the Assyrian, as if Ezekiel spoke concerning this northern
power altogether. But this is incorrect, for the Assyrian
power was then no longer in existence, and the last verse
of this chapter shows that Pharaoh is meant. "This Pharaoh
and his multitude, saith the Lord God" (verse 18).
The description of the Assyrian is given to show that Pharaoh,
King of Egypt, is in greatness like the Assyrian who
had been dealt with in judgment by Jehovah. The Assyrian,
once so powerful and proud, is used as a solemn warning,
that the King of Egypt would not be spared, but suffer
the same fate. The Cedar in Lebanon is a picture of
the greatness of the Assyrian and Pharaoh; its height and
wide-spreading branches; its superior place among all the
trees are used to symbolize both of them. The Cedar is a
most majestic tree, often reaching a great height; the
branches are thick and long, spreading out horizontally
from the enormous trunk. The Cedar is also employed as a
type of the righteous and of Israel. "The righteous shall
flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in[204]
Lebanon" (Psalm xcii:12). "His branches shall spread
... and his smell like Lebanon" (Hos. xiv:6). But here
the cedar means human grandeur and national greatness,
full of arrogant pride and therefore doomed to be abased.
Isaiah in his sublime prophecy on the coming day of the
Lord uses thus the cedars of Lebanon: "For the day of
the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud
and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he
shall be brought low. And upon all the cedars of Lebanon
that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan"
(Isa. ii:12-13).

Of interest are the words in the sixth verse: "All the
fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs." The
same statement is made in the dream of Nebuchadnezzar,
in which the King of Babylon had seen a great tree, "and
the fowls of heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof" (Dan.
iv:12). And our Lord spoke a parable of the mustard seed
which became a tree "so that the birds of the air come and
lodge in the branches thereof" (Matt. xiii:32). The fowls
mean peoples who associated with Assyria, Egypt and the
King of Babylon, while these powers became proud and
lifted up. The mustard tree in the parable of our Lord represents
the development of Gentile-Christendom as an
earthly institution and organization, lifted up like a big
tree, and the birds which find shelter there are the symbols
of the unclean, the unsaved masses, nominally professing
Christians. And God who dealt with the Assyrians, with
the King of Egypt, God, who humbled Nebuchadnezzar,
will yet deal in His coming great judgments with the Gentile
nations of today for their pride and wickedness, as well
as with Christendom.


II. The Fall and Desolation of the Tree.

Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because thou hast lifted up
thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick[205]
boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; I have therefore delivered
him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall
surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have
left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches
are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land;
and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow,
and have left him. Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven
remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves
for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs,
neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water:
for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth,
in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the
pit (verses 10-14).

Judgment came upon Assyria and was also soon to fall
upon Egypt because they were lifted up and defied God.
"Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath
shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is
lifted up in his height, I have therefore delivered him into
the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely
deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness."
Behind these nations of the past stood, as we saw in connection
with the King of Tyrus (chap. xxviii), the dark
shadow of the enemy of God. He is still the master over
the nations which act at the close of the times of the Gentiles.
Satan's crime is that he was and is lifted up with
pride. He fell because he said, "I will ascend into heaven,
I will exalt my throne above the stars of God ... I
will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like
the most High" (Isa. xiv:13-14). And this awful being,
the prince of this world, the god of this age, who domineers
still over the kingdoms of this world, till he is dethroned
by the coming of the Lord, has led in the past and still
leads nations into ruin and ripens them for divine judgment
through pride and what goes with it, defiance of God. Today[206]
our boasting, proud, lifted up and God-defiant age,
an age which rejects God's best, the Gospel of His
Son, is rapidly approaching the threatened judgment,
a judgment far more severe than those which overtook
Assyria and Egypt.

The one mentioned as "the mighty one of the nations"
is Nebuchadnezzar, whom God used to bring judgment
upon Egypt, as we learned from the previous chapters.
He was the golden head of the image which represents the
times of the Gentiles, which may soon take on their final
form, the ten kingdoms in the revived Roman Empire
(Dan. ii). Nebuchadnezzar also became lifted up and God
humbled him for seven years, as God will yet humble the
nations of Christendom.[25] And the judgments of the
past, upon Assyria and others is to be a warning to
others "to the end that none of all the trees by the waters
exalt themselves for their height" (verse 13). But who
among the nations is wise and heeds the warnings of God's
holy Word? See also Rom. xi:16-24, where Christendom
is warned not to boast and not to be high minded.


III. The Overthrow and the Consternation among the
Nations as the result of Egypt's fall.

Thus saith the Lord God; In the day when he went down to the
grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained
the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed:
and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field
fainted for him. I made the nations to shake at the sound of his
fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the
pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all
that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his
shadow in the midst of the heathen. To whom art thou thus like[207]
in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou
be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of
the earth: "thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with
them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,
saith the Lord God" (verses 15-18).

The word "hell," mentioned several times in this paragraph
does not mean the lake of fire, the final and eternal
abode of the wicked, but the word is "sheol," the abode
of the dead, the unknown regions. It does not mean the
grave, for which there is another word used in the Hebrew.
The grave receives the bodies; but the immaterial part of
man, that which has endless being, goes to Sheol, a word
which expresses the unseen and unknown. To sheol the
wicked and the nations who forget God have been turned
(Psalm ix:17) to await their final doom as revealed in Rev.
xx:11-15. The fate of Assyria as well as of Egypt inspired
the surrounding nations with fear; these nations are mentioned
under the figure of trees, "and all the trees of the field
mourned for him." The nations shook with terror when the
powerful world-power was stripped of all its greatness and
passed away. And when Assyria came into sheol and
also Egypt, they found other nations there. These are
mentioned by the term "all the trees of Eden, the choice
and best of Lebanon, all that drink water." These terms
are symbolical of human greatness, glory and prosperity.
And these once powerful and prosperous nations were "comforted"
to find that even Pharaoh would share their fate
and the fate of Assyria. It shows that the disembodied
state in sheol is not an unconscious state, but one of consciousness.
The next chapter, the final one on Egypt's
judgment and fate will show us more of this.[208]


LAMENTATION OVER PHARAOH AND THE FUNERAL
DIRGE.

Chapter xxxii.

The final prophecy of this section was given almost two
years after the message of the previous chapter and about
eighteen months after the fall of Jerusalem. First Ezekiel
is told to take up a lamentation for Pharaoh and announce
for the last time the work of judgment by the sword of the
King of Babylon. After that follows another wail, a solemn
dirge, over the Egyptian multitudes which have passed
into sheol. It is a vivid description of sheol and those who
have descended there. This conclusive prophecy was
uttered by the prophet a few days after the lamentation
over Pharaoh.


I. The Lamentation Over Pharaoh.

And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in
the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me,
saying, Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of
Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations,
and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy
rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouldedst their
rivers. Thus saith the Lord God; I will therefore spread out my
net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring
thee up in my net. Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will
cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of
the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole
earth with thee. And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains,
and fill the valleys with thy height. I will also water with thy
blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains;
and the rivers shall be full of thee. And when I shall put thee out,
I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will
cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.
All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set
darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord God. I will also vex the
hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the
nations, into the countries which thou hast not known. Yea, I[209]
will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be
horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before
them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his
own life, in the day of thy fall (verses 1-10).

Pharaoh is addressed as a young lion among the nations.
Some have rendered it "a lion of the nations is upon thee,"
applying it to Nebuchadnezzar; but this is only a paraphrase
and not warranted by the Hebrew text. He is also
compared again to the dragon or crocodile.[26] (See xxix:3).
What the crocodile does in the rivers and waters, troubling
them and stirring up the dirt, fouling the rivers, Pharaoh
had done among the nations. And now his wicked doings
would be arrested; a net would be spread over him with a
company of many peoples, who would bring him out of his
dominion like a crocodile taken out of the water. He
would be cast upon the open field, "and I will cause all the
fowls of the heavens to settle upon thee and I will fill the
beasts of the whole earth with thee." Then the political
destruction of the great land of Egypt is to be fully accomplished,
here mentioned in symbolical terms, such as the
darkening of the stars, the covering of the sun with a cloud
and the withholding of the light from the moon. But
while all this has a primary meaning as to Pharaoh and
Egypt, these words of judgment also related to that which
is yet, and soon to come upon this earth. Egypt is the
type of the world as it lieth in the wicked one.

Nations to-day are doing what Egypt did. These nations,
the final actors of the times of the Gentiles, in their inhuman,
God and man defying actions, will not be permitted to go
on forever. A day comes in which God will deal with them
as He dealt with Egypt of old. When that day comes, the
day of Jehovah, their complete overthrow will take place[210]
as described so frequently in the prophetic Word. Then
the great judgment supper of God will take place, when the
fowls under heaven are called upon to gather together and
feed upon the slain. There is an interesting suggestion
between verse 4 of this chapter and Revelation xix:17-18.
The same is true when we compare verses 7-8 with Revelation
viii:12. Then read Isaiah xiii:10 and Amos viii:9;
Joel iii:15 and Matthew xxiv:29. That day announced in
these Scriptures and others is rapidly approaching and will
bring the complete overthrow of the domineering, autocratic
world-powers and the god of this age, who controls
them.


II. The Final Announcement of the Sword of Nebuchadnezzar.

For thus saith the Lord God; The sword of the king of Babylon
shall come upon thee. By the swords of the mighty will I cause
thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and
they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof
shall be destroyed. I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from
beside the great waters, neither shall the foot of man trouble them
any more nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. Then will I make
their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the
Lord God. When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the
country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall
smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the
Lord. This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her:
the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for
her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord God
(verses 11-16).

The sword of the Lord to fall upon Egypt was the King of
Babylon, previously announced in chapters xxix and xxx.
At the close of the times of the Gentiles the predicted judgment
will not come upon nations through some other nation,
but the Lord Himself will appear and fight against the
nations who are rebellious against God and against His[211]
anointed (Ps. ii). The stone, which Nebuchadnezzar saw
in his dream, will fall and deal its destructive blow; and that
stone is the Lord Jesus Christ in His personal Coming.
Then the pomp of Egypt, this present age with all its boasted
progress and glory, will pass away and the kingdom from
above will be set up. "Then shall they know that I am the
Lord." It is not a spiritual knowledge, or a knowledge
unto salvation, but a knowledge in the judgments which
take place.

"It is important to remark one point in this series of prophecies,
which commences with the judgment of Jerusalem,
the centre of the former system of nations. They are
executed with the object of making them all know Jehovah:
only in Israel's case there is besides this, the understanding
and the special verification of prophecy. See chapter
xxiv:24-27, Israel; chapter xxv:5, 7, 11, Ammon and Moab;
verses 15-17, especial vengeance on the Philistines; chapter
xxvi, Tyre; chapter xxviii:22, Zidon; chapter xxix:19,
Egypt; as also chapters xxx:26, xxxii:15. With respect to
Edom (chap. xxv:14), it is only said that Edom shall know
the vengeance of Jehovah by means of Israel&mdash;a further proof
that in certain respects this prophecy extends to the last
days. These prophecies, then, furnish us in general with the
manifestation of Jehovah's power, so as to make Him known
to all by the judgments which He executed; already partially
realized in the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar, but to be
fully accomplished by-and-by in favor of Israel."[27]


III. The Dirge and Unveiling of the Unseen World.

It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the
month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and[212]
the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the
earth, with them that go down into the pit. Whom dost thou
pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword:
she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.
The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst
of hell (sheol) with them that help him: they are gone down, they
lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword. Asshur is there and all her
company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by the
sword: Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company
is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword,
which caused terror in the land of the living. There is Elam and all
her multitudes round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen
by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether
parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living;
yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the
pit. They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised,
slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land
of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that
go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain.
There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are
round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword,
though they caused their terror in the land of the living. And they
shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised,
which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they
have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall
be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty
in the land of the living. Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst
of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the
sword. There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with
their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they
shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to
the pit. There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the
Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror
they are ashamed of their might: and they lie uncircumcised with
them that be slain by her sword, and bear their shame with them that
go down to the pit. Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted
over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain
by the sword, saith the Lord God. For I have caused my terror
in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the[213]
uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even
Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord God (verses 17-32).

Two weeks after the lamentation over Pharaoh, the prophet
uttered this solemn and most impressive elegy over the
multitude of Egypt and the heathen nations who have
gone into sheol. It has been called a weird Dantesque
funeral-march over the whole heathen world; but it is more
than that. We look here into sheol and see the nations
gathered there, stripped of their glory, in deepest abasement
and shame. Their bodies are in the pit, the grave, and their
souls in sheol, the unseen regions. God's patience was
exhausted with them, the measure of their wickedness
became full, then judgments swept them off the earth and
they passed away and descended into sheol. And what
irony there is connected with it! "Whom dost thou surpass
in beauty? Go down and be thou laid with the uncircumcised."
And as the King came there with his multitudes,
whom did they find there? Asshur, that is Assyria, is
mentioned first: "Asshur is there and all her company."
She was a cruel, pitiless, destructive power, and now she,
who once caused "terror in the land of the living," is helpless,
with all her power gone in the unseen world. Elam,
Meshech, Tubal, Edom, the princes of the North and the
Zidonians are named as being in existence there. Once
great powers but now cut off; they lie with the uncircumcised
in weakness and disgrace. While in chapter xxxi:16
the dead and gone nations were comforted over Pharaoh
who descended into sheol; in this passage Pharaoh, who
sees these nations, now is himself comforted as he discovers
his former enemies there.

A similar statement about sheol as a place of departed
nations, who are nevertheless conscious, is found in the
book of Isaiah. There the King of Babylon is seen in his
descent into sheol. "Sheol from beneath is moved for[214]
thee to meet thee at thy coming; it stirreth up the dead
for thee, all the chieftains of the earth; it hath raised up
from their thrones all the Kings of the nations. All they
shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak
as we? Are thou become like unto us? Thy pomps are
brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols,
the worm is spread under thee, and the worms over thee?"
(Is. xiv:9-11). Solemn words these are behind which
stands the undeniable truth of a conscious and eternal existence
of the human race. But only the New Testament
Scriptures give the full light upon the future state.




[215]
II. PREDICTIONS AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM.

Chapter xxxiii-xlviii.


COMMISSIONS. JERUSALEM'S FALL ANNOUNCED.

Chapter xxxiii.

The previous chapter closed the predictions which were
uttered by the Prophet before the destruction of Jerusalem,
and now we come to the second part of this prophetic
book, containing the predictions of Ezekiel after the fall
of Jerusalem. And these predictions unfold the great future
of Israel, their restoration and national revival, the spiritual
blessings in store for them, the invasion of their land by the
last enemy, Gog and Magog, their complete overthrow,
and the deliverance of His people. After that, in the final
nine chapters of this book, the Prophet records the vision
of the coming and crowning glory of Israel, as they shall
possess it when restored to their land. Here we learn how
the departed glory will return and the Prophet describes a
great temple and its worship. It is the millennial temple,
that coming, earthly house to which the nations shall turn
to worship the King. Then the name of Jerusalem will be
"Jehovah-shammah"&mdash;the Lord is there (xlviii:35). While
the predictions uttered by Ezekiel before the fall of Jerusalem
have mostly been fulfilled, as we learned in our expositions,
the great prophecies which we follow now, given
after the fall of the city are still unfulfilled. These predictions
are of great importance and of deep interest, for they
give God's program for His chosen people, how He will deal
with them in His infinite grace and receive them nationally[216]
when the times of the Gentiles are over and He comes again.
Because these things are now so very near, and we stand
on the threshold of their fulfilment, they are for us of double
interest. We shall therefore examine them more closely
and also learn from present day events how all is now getting
ready for the accomplishment of God's revealed purposes.

In the introductory chapter of this section, Ezekiel as
the watchman is commissioned to warn the house of Israel;
then the messenger came announcing the fall of Jerusalem;
the prophet's lips were unsealed and he was no more dumb,
but uttered again the Word of the Lord.


I. The Commission to the Watchman.

Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, when I bring
the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their
coasts, and set him for their watchman: If when he seeth the sword
come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not
warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall
be upon his own head. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and
took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh
warning shall deliver his soul. But if the watchman see the sword
come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned;
if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is
taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's
hand. So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman
unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my
mouth, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked,
O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn
the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity;
but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou
warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from
his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy
soul (verses 1-9).

The commission to Ezekiel as watchman corresponds to[217]
the same commission as found in the first section of this
book. (See chapters iii:16-21.) The watchman is to warn
of impending danger by the blowing of the trumpet. If
the warning is unheeded, the consequences rest upon the
person who rejected the warning. But he that taketh
warning shall deliver his soul. And if the watchman is not
faithful in sounding the alarm and disaster overtakes some
on account of it, their blood will be required at the watchman's
hand. Ezekiel was set as a watchman unto the
house of Israel. He received the message from the Lord
and was to warn them. The divine message was that the
wicked should surely die, and if the watchman neglected
to deliver that message and warn the wicked he would die,
while his blood would be required from the hands of the
watchman. But if the wicked was warned and did not
act upon the warning, he would die; the faithful watchman
had delivered his own soul. Ezekiel was the faithful watchman
while the false prophets did not deliver the message
and perished with the ungodly. How great then the responsibility
of those who are called as watchmen! And
how few the faithful ones who deliver the divine warning
to the unsaved!


II. Principles of Divine Justice Announced.

Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;
Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon
us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? Say
unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the
death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and
live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die,
O house of Israel? Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the
children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall
not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness
of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth
from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live
for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth. When I shall[218]
say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own
righteousness and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not
be remembered: but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he
shall die for it. Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt
surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and
right; If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had
robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity;
he shall surely live, he shall not die. None of his sins that he hath
committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which
is lawful and right; he shall surely live. Yet the children of thy
people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their
way is not equal. When the righteous turneth from his righteousness,
and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. But if the
wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and
right, he shall live thereby. Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is
not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after
his ways (verses 10-20).

The exiles knew that the just wrath of God rested upon
them as a nation and that their sins were unforgiven.
Therefore they asked "If our transgressions and sins be
upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then
live?" They also accused the Lord of inconsistency by
saying "the way of the Lord is not equal" (verse 20; see
also xviii:25, 29). The answer Jehovah sends them makes
known the principles on which He will deal with them individually
as a just God. "O ye house of Israel, I will
judge you every one after his ways." Judgment rested
upon them as a nation but the individual still could turn
to the Lord in repentance. What a wonderful declaration
it is which is recorded in verse eleven! "Say unto them,
as I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the
death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his
way and live; turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for
why will ye die, O house of Israel?" What compassion and
mercy! As it was a day of judgment which had come
upon them, true repentance was the needed thing. A past[219]
righteousness could not shield them from the judgment if
sin had been committed. "As for the wickedness of the
wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth
from his wickedness." The wicked confessing and forsaking
his sin would find mercy and forgiveness, while those
who were impenitent would surely die and not live. "None
of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto
him; he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall
surely live." And this gracious promise was given in anticipation
of the work of the cross, the redemption by the blood
of Christ, by which God's righteousness is declared in passing
thus over sins of Old Testament believers who turned
to God (Rom. iii:25). The principles of Divine justice are
summed up in verses 18 and 19: "When the righteous
turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity,
he shall even die thereby. But if the wicked turn from his
wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall
live thereby." Needless to say all this must be viewed as
under the law-covenant. But their complaint that the
way of the Lord is not equal was wrong; it was their way
which was not equal. They were to be judged each according
to what they had done.


III. The News of Jerusalem's Fall. The Prophet's
Mouth Opened.

And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the
tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had
escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.
Now the hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening, afore he
that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came
to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no
more dumb. Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel
speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but
we are many; the land is given us for inheritance. Wherefore say
unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Ye eat with the blood, and[220]
lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood; and shall ye
possess the land? Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination,
and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye
possess the land? Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord
God; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the
sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to
be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall
die of the pestilence. For I will lay the land most desolate, and the
pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall
be desolate, that none shall pass through. Then shall they know
that I am the Lord, when I have laid the land most desolate because
of all their abominations which they have committed (verses
21-29).

At last the long threatened and predicted fall of Jerusalem
through Nebuchadnezzar, which had happened months
before is announced to the exiles by one who had escaped.
The hand of the Lord was then upon the Prophet in the
evening, before the messenger had arrived, and had opened
his mouth. In chapter xxiv:27 the promise had been given
that when he that escaped came, the Prophet should be no
more dumb. "In that day shall thy mouth be opened to
him which is escaped, and then thou shalt speak, and be no
more dumb, and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they
shall know that I am the Lord." This dumbness does not
mean that his mouth was silent and did not utter a word,
for he prophesied in chapters xxv-xxxii. He was to be dumb as
regards Israel and his testimony to his people; the intervening
chapters, before the messenger came concerns other
nations. And now the messenger had arrived, his mouth
is opened again to prophesy concerning Israel. It seems
the hand of the Lord was upon Ezekiel from the evening
to the morning when the messenger announced "the city
is smitten." The words recorded in the first part of this
chapter are undoubtedly the prophet's evening discourse,
and form an introduction to this section. He is told to
rebuke those that inhabit the waste places in the land of[221]
Israel. This is the remnant left in the land by Nebuchadnezzar,
to whom the king of Babylon gave Geddaliah as
ruler (2 Kings xxv:22). In spite of the great judgment
which had come upon Jerusalem and upon the land, this
remnant, which remained in the land, was unbroken and
exhibited a strange self-confidence. They reasoned in this
wise: "Abraham was one and he inherited the land; but
we are many; the land is given us for inheritance." But
they lacked the faith and righteousness of Abraham, and
the Lord uncovers now their false claims and pretensions
by showing their moral character. Their hearts were hardened;
they lived on in their wicked, vile and idolatrous
ways. "And shall ye possess the land?" asks Jehovah.
And He answers, "As I live, surely they that are in the
waste places shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the
open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they
that be in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the
pestilence."


IV. Hearers of the Words of the Prophet, and Not
Doers.

Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking
against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak
one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray
you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord.
And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before
thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do
them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart
goeth after their covetousness. And, lo, thou art unto them as a
very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play
well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them
not. And when this cometh to pass (lo, it will come), then shall
they know that a prophet hath been among them (verses 30-33).

How deplorable was their condition, listening to the
Prophet's words, saying one to the other, "Come, I pray
you, what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord."[222]
They took before the Prophet the position as God's people,
professing it with their mouths, listening to all the Prophet
said and yet refused obedience. With their mouth they
showed much love, they spoke nice and pleasant words,
but their hearts continued in the evil ways. As the Septuagint
version paraphrases it, "because a lie is in their
mouth." They were hearers of the words, but not doers. And
such is to-day the sad condition of Christendom. What the
Prophet had announced was coming to pass and when
it came they would find out that a Prophet had been among
them.

And even so to-day. The mass of professing Christians
listen to the Word of God. They remain indifferent.
Their hearts and consciences are not touched. But ere
long they, too, will find out "that a Prophet hath been
among them" and that the Word they rejected and refused
to obey will condemn them.


CONCERNING THE SHEPHERDS.

Chapter xxxiv.

This chapter contains the first great prophecy given to
Ezekiel after the fall of Jerusalem had been announced. It
is a message of comfort and concerns the glorious future of
the nation in coming days, when the true shepherd of Israel
will appear in their midst. Here we find the majestic "I
will" of the Lord, that blessed word of the grace-covenant
of a sovereign God. It tells us what Jehovah in infinite
mercy will do for His scattered and bleeding people, His
own flock, the people who are still beloved for the fathers'
sakes (Rom. xi:28). How He will gather His scattered
sheep, bring them back from their wanderings among the
nations, save them, feed them, heal and restore them, give
them the true shepherd and make a covenant of peace with
His people is now blessedly made known. We shall see[223]
that none of these gracious promises was fulfilled in the
return of the remnant from Babylon, nor have these promises
been accomplished since then. It all awaits the coming
of their Shepherd-King, the true David, the Lord Jesus
Christ. The chapter begins with a description of the sheep
of Israel in their sad and deplorable condition and an indictment
of the false shepherds.


I. The False Shepherds of Israel.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto
them, Thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds; Woe be to the
shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds
feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the
wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. The
diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that
which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken,
neither have ye brought again that which was driven away,
neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with
cruelty have ye ruled them. And they were scattered, because
there is no shepherd; and they became meat to all the beasts of the
field, when they were scattered. My sheep wandered through all
the mountains, and upon every high hill; yea, my flock was scattered
upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after
them (verses 1-6).

The shepherds of Israel were the kings and princes who
ruled over the nation and had authority over them. The
prophet Jeremiah also received a similar message against
these evil shepherds who had spoiled the flock. "Woe be
unto the pastors (shepherds) that destroy and scatter the
sheep of my pasture! saith the Lord. Therefore thus
saith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that feed
my people; ye have scattered my flock, and driven them
away, and have not visited them; behold I will visit upon
you the evil of your doings, saith the Lord" (Jere. xxiii:
1-2). Shepherds are called to feed the flock; but these
shepherds of Israel fed themselves. They were responsible[224]
for the deplorable condition of the flock. They ruled them
with force and cruelty. There was no strengthening for
those diseased, no healing for the sick, no recovery of them
who were lost and driven away. Utterly selfish, they cared
not for the sheep of His pasture; they neither feared God
nor loved His people. They looked upon the people not
as the flock of God, but only as their own to spoil, misuse
and domineer over. Therefore, "They were scattered,
because there is no shepherd; and they became meat for all
the beasts of the field, where they were scattered. My
sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every
high hill; yea my flock was scattered upon all the face of
the earth, and none did search or seek after them" (verses
5-6).

Such was the sad condition of the people Israel. And
when the Lord Jesus appeared in their midst to seek the lost
sheep of the house of Israel, He found them as sheep without
a shepherd and He had compassion upon them (Mark
vi:34). But they rejected Him and the Shepherd was
smitten. Zechariah's prophecy was fulfilled. "Awake, O
sword, against my Shepherd, and against the man that is
my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts. Smite the Shepherd and
the sheep shall be scattered, and I will turn mine hand
upon the little ones" (Zech. xiii:7). The false shepherds,
the Pharisees and the Sadducees, were a curse to the people
and the leaders were against the Shepherd. They delivered
Him into the hands of the Gentiles. And now for nearly
2,000 years the sheep have been scattered and peeled,
wandering among the nations of the earth (Luke xxi:24).
What is their hope and coming blessing we learn from this
great prophecy.[28]
[225]

II. The False Shepherds Convicted and Set Aside.

Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord; As I live,
saith the Lord God, surely because my flock became a prey, and
my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there
was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock,
but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; Therefore,
O ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord
God; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my
flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock;
neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will
deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for
them (verses 7-10).

Jehovah addresses the shepherds and condemns their
wicked oppression of His own sheep. He remembers in
mercy His flock which has been torn as a prey by their
leaders, who acted like the wild beasts of the field. He
requires now the flock from their hands and sets the false
shepherds aside and announces that He will deliver His
sheep. "For I will deliver my flock from their mouth,
that they may not be meat for them." The rest of the
chapter shows His deliverance and what the Lord will
do for His people Israel.


III. The Deliverance of His Flock.

For thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I, even I, will both search
my sheep, and seek them out. As a shepherd seeketh out his flock
in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I
seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they
have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. And I will bring
them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and
will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains
of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the
country. I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high
mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a
good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains
of Israel. I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down,
saith the Lord God. I will seek that which was lost, and bring again[226]
that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was
broken, and will strengthen that which was sick; but I will destroy
the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment. And as
for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I judge
between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.
Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your
pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul
the residue with your feet? And as for my flock, they eat that
which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which
ye have fouled with your feet (verses 11-19).

"Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep and
will seek them out." Jehovah arises in behalf of His scattered
sheep. He will Himself exercise the office of a true
shepherd, seeking out His flock. The cloudy and dark
day (the times of the Gentiles) is gone and another morning
breaks, the morning for which His people have waited so
long. What He will do at that time for His scattered sheep
is now fully proclaimed. "I will bring them out from the
people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring
them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains
of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of
the country. I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon
the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be; there shall
they lie down in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they
feed upon the mountains of Israel. I will feed my flock,
and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord." And
all this has not yet come to pass. Some apply these words
to the restoration of a remnant from the Babylonian captivity
and see no future fulfillment of these promises. It is
evident that the returning remnant did not possess these
blessings. Others make a spiritual application and claim
that it means the church and the blessing which Gentiles
will receive as the sheep of Christ. This is the common
path which most commentators follow. It needs no lengthy[227]
refutation, for Ezekiel, nor the other prophets know nothing
of the church and the "other sheep," Gentiles saved by grace
and with believing Jews constituting the one flock (John
x:16; Ephesians iii:1-6). This is unrevealed in the Old
Testament. These gracious words of promise have not
yet been fulfilled, nor will they be fulfilled as long as the
church, the body of Christ is being gathered out from all
nations. All must wait till God's purpose in this age is
accomplished. When the church is complete as to its
elect number, when the Lord has come for His saints and
the true church has passed from earth into glory, then will
the Lord turn in mercy to His people Israel and these
promises given by Ezekiel will be fulfilled.

But Jehovah will also feed them in that coming day of
blessing with judgment. "I will seek that which was lost,
and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind
up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which
was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will
feed them with judgment." The fat and the strong are
the apostates of Israel. He will deal with the flock in
judgment. Before He occupies the throne of His glory,
when He separates the assembled nations as a shepherd
divides the sheep from the goats, He will judge His people
Israel. "And as for you, my flock, thus saith the Lord
God, Behold I judge between cattle and cattle, between
the rams and the he goats." The unbelieving, apostate
part of Israel will be cut off by the judgments of the great
tribulation, but a God-fearing remnant will be saved. To
this remnant the promises will be made good. "And I
will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
whither I have driven them, and will bring them again
to their folds, and they shall be fruitful and increase"
(Jere. xxiii:3). With this remnant He will make an everlasting
covenant. "And I will make an everlasting covenant[228]
with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do
them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they
shall not depart from Me. Yea, I will rejoice over them
to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly
with my whole heart and with my whole soul" (Jere.
xxxii:40, 41).


IV. The One Shepherd and the Covenant of Peace.

Therefore thus saith the Lord God unto them; Behold, I, even I,
will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.
Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed
all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;
therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey;
and I will judge between cattle and cattle. And I will set up one
shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David;
he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And I the Lord
will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them;
I the Lord have spoken it. And I will make with them a covenant
of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land:
and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing;
and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall
be showers of blessing. And the tree of the field shall yield her
fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe
in their land, and shall know that I am the Lord, when I have broken
the banks of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those
that served themselves of them. And they shall no more be a prey
to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them;
but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.
And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be
no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame
of the heathen any more. Thus shall they know that I the Lord
their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel,
are my people, saith the Lord God. And ye my flock, the flock
of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God
(verses 20-31).

We reach the climax in the final section of this chapter.
He through whom all this will be accomplished is now mentioned[229]
by the prophet. "And I will set up one Shepherd
over them, and He shall feed them, even my servant David;
he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And
I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David a
prince among them; I the Lord have spoken it." Some
have applied this to Zerubbabel, the head of Judah at the
return from the Babylonish captivity; this is done by those
who deny a future restoration of Israel. Others take these
words in a strictly literal sense and teach that David the
King will become the head of the nation once more and
raised from the dead will be the one shepherd over His
people. It is not David, but He who is according to the
flesh the Son of David and David's Lord as well. The one
Shepherd can only be the Messiah. Numerous passages
show that David's name is used in a typical sense. Jeremiah
announced, "They shall serve the Lord their God,
and David their King, whom I will raise up unto them"
(Jere. xxx:10). Here David stands typically for Christ,
the Messiah of Israel, for He is raised up unto them when
Jacob's trouble is ended (verses 1-7). Of Him Jeremiah
speaks more fully in chapter xxiii:5-6: "Behold, the
days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David
a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper,
and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In
His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely;
and this is the name whereby He shall be called, the Lord
our Righteousness." The two, Judah and Israel, will be
reunited by the one Shepherd. The Messiah of Israel is
also mentioned by Hosea as David. "Afterward shall the
children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and
David their King and shall fear the Lord and His goodness
in the latter days" (Hosea iii:5). Isaiah speaks of the
sure mercies of David and adds, "Behold I have given Him
for a witness to the people, a leader (prince) and commander[230]
to the people." It is therefore not David, raised from the
dead, but the Prince of Peace, who was here once to seek
the lost sheep of the house of Israel and who comes again
to save the remnant of His people Israel and to receive the
Throne of David (Isaiah ix:6-7).

When the Lord is doing all what is promised here and the
remnant has accepted the long rejected Messiah-King, a
covenant of peace and blessing will follow. "And I will
make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the
evil beasts to cease out of the land, and they shall dwell
safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods." Peace
will come to the land and to the whole earth with His
Coming. The evil beasts, the Gentile world powers (Dan.
vii) will no longer devastate the land. All will be peace and
safety so that they can sleep peacefully in the woods. "There
shall be showers of blessing" (verse 26). How often a
hymn is sung based upon this promise:


"There shall be showers of blessing,
This is the promise of love."


But how few who sing it know that the promise belongs
first of all to Israel. When the Lord comes the showers of
blessing will be poured forth upon His people and upon all
nations. It will be "the times of refreshing" (Acts iii:20).
Verses 27 and 28 give a brief description of the millennial
Kingdom. Groaning creation will then be delivered and
the wild beasts will have their nature changed (compare
verse 28 with Isaiah xi:6-9 and Rom. viii:19-22). There
is no need to speculate on the meaning of "the plant of
renown" which will be raised up. It is none other than He,
who, as to His humiliation, is described as "a tender plant"
and "as a root out of a dry ground" (Isaiah liii:2). But
now He appears in all His glory and becomes the plant of
renown. Their shame and suffering will then be over. He
will be their God and they will be His people.[231]


THE JUDGMENT OF MOUNT SEIR AND WHAT
FOLLOWS.

Chapter xxxv.

This is another judgment message, which is closely related
to the coming restoration of Israel. When the Lord is
merciful to His people and bestows upon them the promised
blessings He will also deal with their enemies in judgment.
Edom was the most bitter enemy of Israel, their blood-relation.
The judgment threatened here was executed
upon Edom; but it has a prophetic meaning of the judgment
which is in store for the enemies of God's people when
the times of the Gentiles end and God arises in behalf of
His suffering and persecuted people.


I. The Judgment of Mount Seir.

Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, And say
unto it, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, O mount Seir, I am
against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I
will make thee most desolate. I will lay thy cities waste, and thou
shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Because
thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the
children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their
calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end: Therefore, as
I live, saith the Lord God, I will prepare thee unto blood, and
blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not hated blood, even blood
shall pursue thee. Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate,
and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.
And I will fill his mountains with his slain men; in thy hills, and in
thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with
the sword. I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities
shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. Because
thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall
be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the Lord was there: Therefore,
as I live, saith the Lord God, I will even do according to
thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out
of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among[232]
them, when I have judged thee. And thou shalt know that I am
the Lord, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou
hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid
desolate, they are given us to consume. Thus with your mouth
ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against
me: I have heard them (verses 1-13).

Mount Seir is mentioned for the first time in Genesis
xxxvi:9, as the dwelling place of the Edomites. Seir means
"shaggy," an allusion to the rugged character of Idumea.
The Edomites and Israelites were descendants of Abraham;
Edom from Esau and Israel from Jacob. God told Israel
not to forget their relationship to the descendants of Esau.
But the Edomites hated Israel. Beautiful were the words
which Moses addressed to Edom, when he sent messengers
from Kadesh. "Thus saith thy brother Israel, thou knowest
all the travail that hath befallen us, how our fathers went
down to Egypt and dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the
Egyptians evil entreated us, and our fathers; and when
we cried unto the Lord, He heard our voice, and sent an
angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt, and behold we
are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border; let
us pass, I pray thee through thy land" (Numbers xx:14-17).
The Edomites rejected this loving word and forced the
Israelites to take another way. More than once did they
attack from their mountains the people Israel and slew them.
"He did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off
all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his
wrath forever" (Amos i:11). Most scathing is Edom's
arraignment through the prophet Obadiah. "For thy
violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee,
and thou shalt be cut off forever. In the day that thou
stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers
carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into
his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast
one of them. But thou shouldest not have looked on the[233]
day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger;
neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of
Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest
thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress" (Obad.
verses 9-14). Theirs was a perpetual hatred as God speaks
here through Ezekiel. Judgment is therefore announced,
a judgment which should make their land desolate and extinguish
them as a nation. "I will make thee most desolate."
"I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate."
"Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate." "I will
make thee perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not
return." They were a proud, a boasting people, defying
God and hating His chosen people. "Thus with your mouth
ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words
against me; I have heard them."

And this threatened judgment has fallen upon Edom's
land. Their capital was the great rock city Petra, called
Selah in the Bible (2 Kings xiv:7).

It was once a powerful city, which carried on an immense
trade; it was, according to ancient historians, the terminus
of one of the great commercial routes of Asia. And now
in that once so prosperous land an indescribable desolation
reigns. Its great commerce has utterly passed away and
the doom announced in this chapter has been almost fully
accomplished. Yet all this also stands related to a future
day when Israel is being delivered and when the Lord will
judge Edom and all the nations which hate His people.
"The punishment of their iniquity is accomplished, O,
daughter of Zion; He will no more carry thee away into
captivity; He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom;
He will discover thy sins" (Lam. iv:22). The spirit of
hatred, pride, envy and blasphemy mentioned in verses
11-13 is characteristic of the ungodly nations who defy
God when the times of the Gentiles end. Of that final[234]
beast which domineers over the earth and persecutes the
remnant of Israel, before the Lord comes, it is written, "And
he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
His name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell
in heaven" (Rev. xiii:6). But as Ezekiel declares concerning
these blasphemies spoken against Israel and Israel's Lord,
"I have heard them," and He will act, in judgment against
all His enemies.


II. The Time of Rejoicing.

Thus saith the Lord God; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will
make thee desolate. As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the
house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou
shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and
they shall know that I am the Lord (verses 14-15).

The time is coming when the whole earth will rejoice.
Moses in his prophetic Song spoke of this: "Rejoice O
ye nations, with His people; for He will avenge the blood
of His servants, and will render vengeance to His adversaries,
and will be merciful unto His land, and to His people"
(Deut. xxxii:43). When the Lord comes and delivers His
earthly people and brings them back to their land all will
be completely reversed. Israel now mourning and suffering
will rejoice and all their enemies shall mourn forever, on
account of God's righteous judgments. Then will the world
know that He is Jehovah.


THE PROMISES OF GRACE.

Chapter xxxvi.

With this chapter the great prophetic utterances of
Ezekiel begin which have for a topic the future restoration
and blessing of the people Israel. From chapter xxxvi to
the end of this book all is unfulfilled. How Jehovah will deal
with the enemies of His people in judgment, and then turn in[235]
grace and mercy to His own nation to bless them with
spiritual and national blessings is the message of this chapter.
In chapter xxxvii we find the vision of the dry bones, typical
of the national and spiritual resurrection of Israel. The
house of Judah and the house of Israel will be united into
one, to dwell in the land of their fathers. The great blessings
will then be theirs under the covenant of peace, while the
tabernacle of God is in the midst of them and the true King
reigns over them. Chapters xxxviii and xxxix show the
final enemies of Israel, Gog and Magog, and their complete
overthrow. Chapters xl-xlviii are millennial, giving a description
of the future temple to be built in Jerusalem, its
worship and glory.


I. The Judgment of Israel's Enemies.

Also, thou Son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel,
and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord: Thus
saith the Lord God; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha,
even the ancient high places are ours in possession: Therefore
prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Because they have
made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye
might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye
are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people:
Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God;
Thus saith the Lord God; to the mountains, and to the hills, to the
rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities
that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue
of the heathen that are round about; Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the
residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed
my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart,
with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey. Prophesy therefore
concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains,
and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the
Lord God; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury,
because ye have borne the shame of the heathen: Therefore thus
saith the Lord God; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen
that are about you, they shall bear their shame (verses 1-7.)[236]

The enemy had spoken blasphemies against the mountains
of Israel; the Lord had heard the arrogant language of
Edom (xxxv:12-13), and now the prophet is commanded to
address the personified mountains of Israel in words of
consolation and assurance. Previously he had as God's
prophet uttered denunciations against the mountains and
high places of Israel (vi:1-7), but now after the time of
Israel's chastisement is passed and the dawn of their restoration
breaks, the Lord turns against the enemies of His
people. The enemy had said against them with a shout of
exultation: "Aha! even the ancient high places are ours in
possession." Edom and other nations knew that the Lord
had promised to Israel the land for their possession. They
claimed with a proud taunt Israel's mountains and high
places as their possession, and thereby ignored God and His
covenant with His people. And so it is that the nations
have forgotten what God has promised to Israel. Their
land and city has been trodden down by the Gentiles.
Gentiles have stretched out their hands to possess the
mountains of Israel and occupied the land which by covenant
belongs to the seed of Abraham. When the times of the
Gentiles come to a close nations will once more attempt to
take possession of Israel's land and make an invasion.
Then the Lord will arise against these nations. Of this
Ezekiel speaks, "Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I
spoken against the residue of nations, and against all Edom,
which have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession
with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds,
to cast it out for a prey; therefore prophesy concerning the
land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills,
to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord
God; Behold I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury,
because ye have borne the shame of the nations. Therefore
thus saith the Lord God: I have lifted up mine hand, saying,[237]
Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear
their shame."

Jehovah speaks of Israel's land as "my land," and in holy
indignation and jealous for His people and their land, He
arises now to put judgment and shame upon the nations
which reproached Him. He lifts His hand in token of an oath,
that He will do this now. His time has come to be merciful
to His people and His land, and that will mean judgment for
their enemies (See Zech. i:13-19). And that time is not
far distant now when God will turn to His ancient people in
mercy and put judgment upon the nations which have
forgotten God and ignored His infallible word and revealed
purposes.


II. The Promised Return to the Land.

But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches,
and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to
come. For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye
shall be tilled and sown: And I will multiply men upon you, all the
house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and
the wastes shall be builded: And I will multiply upon you man and
beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you
after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your
beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. Yea, I will
cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall
possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt
no more henceforth bereave them of men. Thus saith the Lord
God; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men,
and hast bereaved thy nations; Therefore thou shalt devour men
no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord
God. Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people
any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith
the Lord God (verses 8-15).

The address is still to the mountains of Israel. These are
beautiful words which Jehovah, to comfort His people, puts
into the lips of the prophet. The mountains, so long barren,[238]
would shoot forth their branches and prepare fruit for His
people. Then their imminent return is announced: "For
they are at hand to come." The near fulfillment was the
return of the remnant from the Babylonian captivity. But
that does not exhaust this prophecy; there is a greater homecoming
in store for Israel, when they will be gathered out of
all countries to possess the land and multiply there as they
never did in all their past history. "And I will multiply
men upon you (the mountains), all the house of Israel, even
all of it." No one could claim that this promise found its
fulfillment when a small portion of the house of Judah returned
from Babylon. Here it speaks of all the house of
Israel. And the waste places shall also be builded again as
promised by former prophets, for instance in Isaiah lviii:12,
lxi:4; Amos ix:11, 12, 14. Still greater is the promise, "I will
cause you to be inhabited after the former estate, and will
do better unto you than at your beginnings, and ye shall know
that I am the Lord." Such was not the case when they returned
from Babylon. And what blessing will come to
them, when at last God does all these things! "Yea, I will
cause men to walk upon you (the mountains), even my
people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be
their inheritance and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave
them of men." All would be changed. Jeremiah had
announced, "I will bereave them of children, I will destroy
my people since they return not from their ways" (Jere.
xv:7). When the Lord keeps His promise and brings them
back, their sorrows will be at an end. What are the sorrows
and sufferings of the Babylonian captivity in comparison
with the sufferings which befell them in the year 70 and
throughout this dispensation! And the last page of Israel's
sorrow is yet to be written. All is preparing now for the
great tribulation, and then there will be the intervention
from above, and the coming Lord will wipe away all their[239]
tears. Four times the prophet uses the words "any more"
(verses 14-15), "Neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the
peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to
stumble any more, saith the Lord God." Inasmuch as
there is reproach now upon that nation and they are a reproach,
and that they have stumbled, we know that these
words still await their fulfillment.


III. Israel's Past Sins and Chastisement.

Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by
their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the
uncleanness of a removed woman. Wherefore I poured my fury
upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for
their idols wherewith they had polluted it: And I scattered them
among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries:
according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
And when they had entered unto the nations, whither they went,
they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the
people of the Lord, and are gone forth out of his land (verses
16-20).

It needs no lengthy comment to explain this paragraph.
The whole history of that nation bears witness to it. They
were an unclean, a stiffnecked nation; a nation which rejected
His word, yea, Himself, and worshipped idols. But their
crowning sin came when they delivered the Lord Jesus
Christ, their own Messiah-King, into the hands of the
Gentiles. His blood was shed upon the land and they cried,
"His blood be upon us and upon our children." And as a
result they were scattered among the nations, where they
also profaned His holy name (Isaiah lii:5; Rom. ii:24).
What then has Israel done to deserve blessing? The rest of
the chapter answers this question.


IV. Restoration and Blessing Through Grace.

But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had
profaned among the heathen, whither they went. Therefore say[240]
unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; I do not this
for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake,
which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went. And
I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the
nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the
nations shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when
I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. For I will take you
from among the nations, and gather you out of all countries, and will
bring you into your own land. Then will I sprinkle clean water
upon you, and ye shall be clean; from all your filthiness, and from
all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you,
and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the
stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.
And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. And ye
shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be
my people, and I will be your God. I will also save you from all
your uncleannesses; and I will call for the corn and will increase it,
and lay no famine upon you. And I will multiply the fruit of
the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more
reproach of famine among the nations. Then shall ye remember
your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall
loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your
abominations. Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be
it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways,
O house of Israel. Thus saith the Lord God: In the day that I shall
have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to
dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded. And the desolate
land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that
passed by. And they shall say, This land that was desolate is
become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and
ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited. Then the
heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord
build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate; I the Lord
have spoken it, and I will do it. Thus saith the Lord God; I will
yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them;
I will increase them with men like a flock. As the holy flock, as
the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities
be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the
Lord (verses 21-38).[241]

The Lord's own name, His holy name, which they profaned
among the nations, is what moves Him to act. He
tells them that it was not for their sakes, for any merit in
them, that He would do the things which His prophet is
about to announce. It was His own name as the Lord Who
is a covenant keeping God, the holy name they had so
miserably outraged, which He must vindicate. The nations
were to know, and will yet know, that He is God. He will
sanctify His great name, and declares, "I shall be sanctified in
you before their eyes." But how? When in infinite grace
He deals with this nation and manifests Himself as the
loving, covenant-keeping, grace-bestowing Jehovah. And
that will be when He, Who died for that nation on the cross
(John xii:50-53), Whom they rejected, Whose name they have
profaned, returns from His glory-place. Then will His name
be sanctified in all the earth, when in wondrous grace He
lifts His nation from the dunghill of shame and want and
brings them back to their own land.

This is so marvelously promised by Ezekiel. The characteristic
word in verses 23-38 is the word "I will." It is the
word of sovereign grace. Eighteen times Jehovah saith
what He will do. They are the "I wills" of Israel's hope
and coming glory.

He will gather them from among the nations and all
countries and bring them back to their own land. Only a
superficial expositor can speak of a fulfillment when they
returned from Babylon. But even if this were so, though it
is not, the verses which follow have never been fulfilled in
the past. The cleansing of the nation is next promised: "I
will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean."[29]
It refers us to the water mixed with the ashes of the red-heifer,[242]
which was sprinkled with a hyssop on the unclean, typifying
the precious blood of Christ in its cleansing power (Heb. ix:13-14;
x:22). Thus when the people of Israel believe on
Him and look upon Him Whom they pierced (Zech. xii:10),
they will be cleansed. "In that day there shall be a fountain
opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness" (Zech. xiii:1). Then
follows the promise of the new birth of Israel. "A new
heart will I also give you, and a new spirit will I put within
you." The stony heart is to be taken away and they will
receive a heart of flesh. Our Lord had this passage in mind
when He talked with Nicodemus about the new birth.
Nicodemus, the teacher in Israel, was ignorant of the fact
that this new birth for Israel is necessary in order to be in
that coming kingdom and to receive its blessings. Therefore
the Lord said to him, "If I have told you earthly things
(about Israel and the new birth as the way into the kingdom)
and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of
heavenly things?" (the heavenly blessings which follow His
sacrificial death).

Then follow still greater restoration promises and blessings,
which Israel never possessed in their past history nor
to-day. He will be their God and they will be His people.
There will be an increase in the corn; famine will disappear
forever. The desolate land will be tilled so that those
who pass through the land will say: "This land that was
desolate is become like the Garden of Eden and the waste
and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are
inhabited." When this restoration and blessing through
grace is accomplished then will they remember their evil
ways and loathe themselves for their iniquities and abominations.
This will be their national repentance. It is not
repentance first, but the Lord will be first gracious and
merciful to them, and as a result they will remember their[243]
ways of evil and humble themselves before Him. And the
nations round about will know that He who has done all
this is Jehovah. All these blessed things will surely be
accomplished in the day when the Lord arises and has
mercy upon Zion (Ps. cii:13): "I, the Lord have spoken, and
I will do it."


THE VISION OF THE DRY BONES.

Chapter xxxvii.

The future restoration or Israel, both their national and
spiritual revival, which the Lord announced in the previous
chapter, is now shown to the prophet in a remarkable vision.
The vision emphasizes once more what Jehovah in grace
will do for them. "And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye
shall live, and I will place you in your own land" (verse 14).
The second half of this chapter predicts the reunion of Judah
and Israel represented by two sticks, which are joined
together.


I. The Vision of the Dry Bones and their Resurrection.

The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the
Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which
was full of bones. And caused me to pass by them round about:
and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they
were very dry. And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones
live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest. Again he said
unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry
bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God unto
these bones, Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye
shall live: And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh
upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye
shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. So I prophesied
as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and
behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them,
and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.
Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of[244]
man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the
four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may
live. So I prophesied, as he commanded me, and the breath came
into them, and they lived; and Then he said unto me, Son of man,
these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our
bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God;
Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come
up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. And ye
shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves,
O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, And shall put
my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your
own land: then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and
performed it, saith the Lord (verses 1-14).

Once more the hand of the Lord is upon the prophet, and
he is carried out in the Spirit of the Lord and is set down in the
midst of a valley. The valley was full of bones and they
were very dry. These dry bones, disjointed and bleached,
picture in the vision the national and spiritual condition
of the whole house of Israel. There was no life in these
bones and all is hopeless as they themselves are concerned.
Then the Lord spoke to His prophet, "Son of man, can these
bones live?" And the prophet answered, "O Lord God,
Thou knowest!" Ezekiel knowing the impossibility that
these bones could ever live, puts the question of their living
upon the Lord. With Him nothing is impossible. He
then is commanded to prophesy: "O ye dry bones, hear
the Word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God unto these
bones, Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you and ye
shall live." And there is to be a complete reconstruction
of these dry bones. Sinews and flesh is to cover them and
the breath of life is to return. And the prophet speaks
the word and there was a noise (literal: voice) and a commotion,
bone came to bone, sinews and flesh came into view
and skin covered them; but they were still dead, as no
breath was in them. Again the prophet is commanded to[245]
prophecy, to utter the word: "Thus saith the Lord God:
Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these
slain, that they may live." No sooner had the prophet
spoken the word as commanded, when suddenly the breath
came into them, and they lived and stood upon their feet,
an exceeding great army. Then the Lord explains the
vision, so that we are not left in doubt of what is meant by it.
The dry bones are typical of the whole house of Israel; they
themselves confess "our bones are dried, and our hope is
lost; we are cut off for our parts." Thus saith the Lord in
answer to their despairing confession, what the vision so
strikingly foreshadows, "I will open your graves and cause
you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the
land of Israel, ... and shall put my Spirit in you,
and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land."

The national resuscitation of the whole house of Israel,
the restoration to their own land and the accompanying
spiritual revival (though the latter does not fully come into
view here) is the meaning of the vision. It may be used in
application[30] in different ways, to illustrate certain truths,
but the true and only interpretation is the one which is
given by the Lord in verses 11-14. But there is an erroneous
interpretation of a serious nature which is widely taught
and believed among many Christians. Because "graves"
are mentioned, besides the dry bones and their resurrection,
it is being taught that the vision means physical resurrection.
Systems, like Millennial Dawnism alias International
Bible Student Association and others, which teach the so-called
larger hope, a second chance for the impenitent dead,[246]
the restitution of the lost, teach that all the Israelites who
have died in their sins will be brought out of their graves
and then be saved. They use this vision to confirm this
invention. An advocate of this theory declared that all
the Christ-hating Pharisees and Sadducees who lived when
our Lord was on earth would be raised up when He comes
and then believe on Him. Matthew xxiii:39 was used by
him as an argument. These restitution teachers also teach
that inasmuch as Israel will have a second chance when
they are raised from the dead, the Gentile dead will share
also in the same. It needs no argument to refute this.
The Word of God teaches a twofold resurrection: a
first resurrection and a second resurrection, a resurrection
of the just and a resurrection of the unjust (John v:28-29).
According to the above theory there would have to be a
third resurrection, a resurrection for a second chance and
ultimate salvation of those who died in their sins. Of such
a resurrection the Bible knows nothing.

In this vision of the dry bones physical resurrection is
used as a type of the national restoration of Israel. It is
used in the same way in Daniel xii:2. In that passage
the sleep in the dust of the earth is symbolical of their
national condition. And when their national sleep ends
there will be an awakening.[31] When we read here in Ezekiel
of graves it must not be taken to mean literal graves, but
the graves are symbolical of the nation as being buried
among the Gentiles. If these dry bones meant the physical
dead of the nation, how could it be explained that they
speak and say, "Our bones are dried up, and our hope is
lost?" The same figure of speech is used in the New Testament.
Of the prodigal it is said, "For this my son was
dead, and is alive again" (Luke xv:24). Yet he was not[247]
physically dead, nor was he made alive physically. Therefore,
this vision has nothing whatever to do with a physical
resurrection. The late Dr. Bullinger, whose erroneous
suggestions have led astray some, also taught that the
vision of the dry bones includes resurrection as well as
restoration.

Equally bad is that spiritualizing method which takes a
vision like this, as well as the hundreds of promises of a
coming restoration, and applies it all to the church, ignoring
totally the claims of Israel and their promised future of
glory. This is the general trend of commentators.

They say that all these visions and promises were exhausted
in the return of the remnant from Babylon (less than 43,000
souls) and the spiritual and larger fulfilment is now going
on in the church. This method is evil, for it robs the Christian
of the true key which unlocks the prophetic Word.

"Their interpretation of prophecy in particular is vitiated
by this fatal mistake, which practically razes the hopes of
Israel from the Bible and lowers ours to a mere succession
to their hope and inheritance with somewhat better light
and privilege. It is a part of the first and widest and most
tenacious corruption of Christianity against which the
apostle fought so valiantly. And it comes in the more
insidiously, because it seems to those under its influence
that they are of all men the most distant from the false
brethren Paul denounced. To their minds the truest guard
against Judaizing is to deny that the Jews will ever be reinstated
as a people, or be restored consequently to their own
land. All the predictions of future blessedness and glory
to Israel they turn over to Christendom now or to the church
in glory. Most pernicious error! For this is exactly to
Judaize the Christian and the church by making them
simply follow and inherit from Israel. The truth is thus
swamped; Israel's bright prospects are denied; Gentile[248]
conceit is engendered; and the Christian is rendered worldly,
instead of being taught his place of blessing on high in
contrast with Israel's on the earth."[32]


II. The Reunion of the Nation and their King.

The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, Moreover,
thou Son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah,
and for the children of Israel his companions; then take another
stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for
all the house of Israel his companions: And join them one to another
into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. And
when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying,
Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? Say unto them,
Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph,
which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows,
and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make
them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. And the sticks
whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. And
say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the
children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone,
and I will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own
land; and I will make them one nation in the land upon the
mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and
they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided
into two kingdoms any more at all: Neither shall they defile
themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable
things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them
out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned and will
cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall
have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and
observe my statutes, and do them. And they shall dwell in the
land that I have given unto Jacob my servant wherein your fathers
have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children,
and their children's children, for ever: and my servant
David shall be their prince for ever. Moreover I will make a
covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant
with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set[249]
my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. My tabernacle
also shall be with them; yea, I will be their God, and they shall be
my people. And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify
Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore
(verses 15-28).

The prophet is next commanded to demonstrate another
coming event for God's ancient people by a symbolical
action. He was to take a stick and write on it "for Judah
and for the children of Israel his companions." On the
second stick, he was to write, "for Joseph, the stick of
Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions."
He was then to join the two sticks so that they became one
in his hand. It denotes the reunion of the house of Judah
with the house of Israel. The sad division of the nation
will end and both will be in His hand one, symbolical of the
royal rod or sceptre, which will be in the hand of the Lord
in the midst of His redeemed people. The Lord will do
all this. "Behold I will take the children of Israel from
among the nations whither they be gone, and will gather
them on every side, and bring them into their own land.
And I will make them one nation in the land upon the
mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them
all; and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they
be divided into two kingdoms any more at all." The house
of Israel never returned from the captivity; only a remnant
of Judah came back. Since then they have been termed
"the lost tribes," though this term is incorrect, for the
Epistle of James is addressed to the twelve tribes of Israel.
Nothing is lost with God. They are hidden rather, and the
time will come when the enigma of the two tribes will be
solved. Attempts have been made to locate them but all have
failed. The Anglo-Israel theory (that England and America
are the lost tribes) is so ridiculous and fantastic that it
merits not even an investigation. God has kept track of[250]
them, and when this promised restoration takes place they
will be brought to light. Then, reunited as they were under
David and Solomon, they will have one King over them.
This King is foreshadowed by both David and his son
Solomon. As King he is called, "David, my servant," who
will be the One Shepherd. And "my servant David, their
prince forever." It is the Lord Jesus Christ, the son of
David, the true and greater Solomon, the Prince of Peace.
How obvious it is that all this does not mean the church.
The Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the church in glory,
but He is also the King of Israel. When the restoration
takes place the angelic message finds its blessed fulfillment:
"The Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father
David, and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever;
and of His Kingdom there shall be no end" (Luke i:32-37).
But how can anyone believe that the words of promise
given through Ezekiel have no future meaning for the seed
of Abraham? Has Israel ever been restored as announced
in these words? Have they ever been saved as promised
in verse 23? Have they ever walked as a nation in perfect
obedience, as stated in the words, "They shall also walk in
My judgments, and observe my statutes and do them."
And verse 25 promises an abiding dwelling in their land
which at this time they do not yet possess. It is the sanctuary
of the Lord set up in their midst.

Only when our Lord returns will all this be accomplished.
Then will it be true, "My tabernacle also shall be with them;
yea, I will be their God and they shall be My people."[251]


GOG AND MAGOG

Chapter xxxviii.

The great restoration vision of the preceding chapter
is followed by another great prophecy concerning the last
enemy of Israel, and how the Lord will deliver His people
and deal in judgment with the invading hordes. This prophecy
is in chapters xxxviii and xxxix. These two chapters
are of great interest and demand a careful study; they have
been misunderstood by many. Frequently the Gog and
Magog have been identified with the final revolt at the
close of the millennium, when Satan is loosed for a little
season (Rev. xx:7-9). The text shows that this is incorrect.
The invasion which Ezekiel describes takes place in the
beginning of the millennium; the invasion of Gog and Magog
in Revelation is postmillennial. Ezekiel's invasion takes
place from the North and the nations are designated; the
nations which gather under Satan at the close of the millennium
are from the four quarters of the earth. The
invaders in Ezekiel's vision fall on the mountains of Israel,
while those assembled after the millennium are devoured
by fire from heaven.

Others have identified these invading enemies with the
nations gathered in the revived Roman Empire. This also
cannot be, for we find that the nations Ezekiel names are
outside of the territory of the restored Roman Empire.
We have to turn to the text itself to find the correct meaning
of this prophecy.


I. The Invasion of Israel's Land.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, set
thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of
Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, And say, Thus saith
the Lord God: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of
Meshech and Tubal: And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into[252]
thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses
and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even
a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling
swords: Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with
shield and helmet: Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah
of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with
thee. Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy
company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto
them. After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years
thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword,
and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of
Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out
of the nations, and they shall dwell safely, all of them. Thou shalt
ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover
the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.
Thus saith the Lord God: It shall also come to pass, that at the
same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think
an evil thought: And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of
unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell
safely, all of them dwellings without walls, and having neither bars
nor gates, To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand
upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people
that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and
goods, that dwell in the midst of the land. Sheba and Dedan, and
the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall
say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered
thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take
away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil? (verses 1-13).

The first question which confronts us in giving an exposition
of these verses is, When does this enemy fall into
Israel's land? At what time does this invasion take place?
We find the answer in the text. The statement is made in
verse eight that Gog and Magog and the other nations
with them invade the land "that is brought back from the
sword, and is gathered out of many people;" they come
"against the mountains of Israel, which have always been
waste; but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they
shall dwell safely, all of them." In verse eleven the evil[253]
purpose of the invader is made known. He says, "I will
go up to the land of unwalled villages, I will go to them
that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without
walls and having neither bars nor gates." He comes
"upon the people that are gathered out of the nations,
which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst
of the land" (verse 12). From all this we learn that the
invasion takes place at the time when the Lord has brought
back His people and resumed His relationship with the
remnant of Israel.

The invasion will happen some time after the beastly
empire with its beasthead (the revived Roman empire), in
its final ten kingdom form and the clay, with the little
horn as leader (Dan. vii; Rev. xiii:1-10) and the false prophet,
the personal Antichrist (Rev. xiii:11, etc.) have
been dealt with in judgment (Rev. xix:19-20). The stone
out of heaven has then fallen upon the feet of the great
dream image of Nebuchadnezzar, and as far as the Western
confederated world power is concerned it is now ended. But
other nations gather now for an assault. It is a Northern
confederacy which sweeps southward to invade the land
as Antiochus Epiphanes did in the past, as well as the
Assyrian in the days of Isaiah. These final invading hosts,
under the leadership of a powerful king, come like a storm,
and like a cloud to cover the land.

In verse 17 we read "Thus saith the Lord God: Art
thou he of whom I have spoken in old times by my servants
the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days for
many years that I would bring thee against them?" By
the way, in these words we have a very clear statement
concerning the prophets of God. They all were the mouthpiece
of Jehovah; He has spoken through them. According
to this verse other prophets prophesied of the same enemy.
Some expositors have stated their inability to find a single[254]
prophecy elsewhere which would confirm Ezekiel's vision
and prophecy.

We believe the foe, of whom Isaiah speaks as the Assyrian,
foreshadows this one coming with his hordes from the North.
The Assyrian in the days of Isaiah, who threatened to
cover the land like a cloud, was Sennacherib. How the
Lord dealt with him by wiping out his proud army with a
single stroke is known to every reader of the Bible. But he
also foreshadows the final Assyrian, the last King of the
North. He is described in Isaiah x. A significant statement
is made in that chapter as to the time when the Lord
will deal with this Assyrian of the future. It is this "Wherefore
it shall come to pass that when the Lord has performed
His whole work upon Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will
punish the fruit of the stout heart of the King of Assyria
and the glory of his high looks" (verse 12). When the
Lord has performed His work in judgment and in mercy
upon Mount Zion and in behalf of Israel and their enemies,
then He will also punish the last invader and spoiler of His
people, the one foreshadowed by the Assyrian.

The Antichrist, who opposed the heavenly rights and
glory of Christ, has then already been overthrown by the
brightness of His coming; and next this last enemy who
opposeth the earthly rights of the King of kings will also
meet his defeat. Notice that in the same chapter of
Isaiah the Lord comforts His people in view of the invader,
showing thereby that He is with them and on their side.
"Therefore, thus saith the Lord God of hosts, O my people
that dwelleth in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian" (Isa.
x:24).

The prophet Micah bears a similar testimony to the
same person. In chapter v we have a prophetic announcement
of the birth of Christ in Bethlehem Ephrata. We also
read of His rejection: "they shall smite the judge of Israel[255]
with a rod upon the cheek." Then the nation is seen as
rejected&mdash;given up, set aside&mdash;till Israel brings forth in
travail pains a godly remnant during the end of the age.
Then the Lord returns. "And He shall stand and rule
in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of
the Lord His God; and they shall abide, for now shall He be
great unto the ends of the earth" (verse 4).

When this has come to pass then the Assyrian appears on
the scene, invading the land. But Micah tells us: "And
this man (Christ) shall be the peace when the Assyrian shall
come into the land" (verse 5). All this confirms the story of
Ezekiel xxxviii. The reader may also turn to Isaiah xxxiii,
to Joel and find there a description of the same invading
forces which Ezekiel describes and their judgment.

But some will find a difficulty here. If the Lord has
returned and His people Israel are being gathered to dwell
in safety in their own land, if the Lord has revealed His
glory, how is it possible that such an invasion can take
place? Is not Satan to be bound at once after Christ has
come back? And if Satan is put into the pit of the abyss
to seduce the nations no more, how is it that these nations
are so blind to come up into Immanuel's land to challenge
the earthly rights of the King of kings?

Satan will be bound for a thousand years, but the last
act by which he attempts to oppose Christ will be through
Gog and Magog. The evil thought the leader, the prince of
Rosh, thinks (verse 10) is inspired by Satan. He stands
behind this wild company of nations and blinds them as he
blinded the kings of the Roman Empire and their armies
to make war against Him that sat upon the horse. (Rev.
xix:19). But then Satan has spent his last arrow. He has
completely failed and is then put into the prison for a
thousand years to seduce the nations no more. His last[256]
attempt was through the prince of Rosh with the nations
mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.

And when the Lord looses him, after the thousand years,
he is still the same old devil, as he always will be forever and
ever; once more he gets a Gog and Magog, this time from the
four quarters of the earth, to put up his very last fight.
How that will end we know from Revelation (xx:7-9).

Still another question is raised, and this one in connection
with the judgment of the nations, as revealed by our Lord
in Matthew xxv:31, etc. After the Lord has returned He
will receive His own throne and begin to judge the nations
He finds then upon the earth. That this is not what has
been termed the final&mdash;universal judgment of the quick and
the dead&mdash;must be apparent to all who divide the Word of
Truth rightly. It is the judgment of the living nations. Now
the question is asked, if the Lord judges at once all living
nations when He comes, how is it that these nations can
invade the land? Why were they not also consigned to the
place of eternal punishment? Why are they still unjudged?

We do not believe that the judgment of the living nations
takes place on a single day. Such a judgment of necessity
covers a longer period of time. Nation after nation will
have to come up for judgment. This will consume considerable
time. There is no question the millennial reign
of our Lord will have two sides. There is first the Davidic
aspect. He will begin to reign first as David did; His
people are with Him and blessed, but all their enemies are
not yet subdued and overcome. He will have to rule first
with a rod of iron. And then when this final enemy is dealt
with, He begins to reign as Prince of Peace, foreshadowed
in the Solomonic reign. Gog and Magog, etc., complete
and end the judgment of the nations. They are the last
enemies to disappear.

After we have ascertained the time when this prophecy[257]
concerning Gog and Magog will be accomplished, we inquire
next who this final enemy is. "And the word of the Lord
came unto me, saying, Son of Man, set thy face against Gog,
the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal,
and prophesy against him, and say, Thus saith the Lord
Jehovah: Behold I am against thee, O Gog, prince of
Rosh, Meshech and Tubal. And I will turn thee back,
and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth,
and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them thoroughly
equipped, a great assemblage with targets and
shields, all of them handling swords. Persia, Cush, and
Phut with them, all of them with shield and helmet; Gomer
and all his bands; the house of Togormah from the uttermost
north, and all his bands&mdash;many peoples with thee."
Here then we have a confederacy of nations. The leader
is the Prince of Rosh (not as the authorized version has it
"the chief prince"), of Meshech and Tubal. This prince is
the head of the confederacy, and with him allied are Persia,
Cush, Phut, Gomer and Togormah. They come out of
the north, or, as it is in Hebrews, "out of the uttermost
north" (verse 15). Inasmuch as the Prince of Rosh is
addressed in verse 3 as Gog, we take it that Gog is the name
given to this prince and leader of these nations. His dwelling
place is in the land of Magog. We know from Genesis x:2
that Magog was the second son of Japheth. Gomer, Tubal
and Meshech were also sons of Japheth; Togormah was a
grandson of Japheth, being the third son of Gomer. Magog's
land, was located in, what is called today, the Caucasus and
the adjoining steppes. And the three Rosh, Meshech and
Tubal were called by the ancients Scythians. They roamed
as nomads in the country around and north of the Black
and the Caspian Seas, and were known as the wildest barbarians.
We learn from this that the invading forces, which
fall into Israel's land in the future, when Israel has been[258]
regathered, come from a territory north of Palestine, which
today is in the hands of Russia. And here we call attention
to the prince, this northern leader, or king, who is the head
of all these nations. He is the prince of Rosh. Careful
research has established the fact that the progenitor of Rosh
was Tiraz (Gen. x:2) and that Rosh is Russia. All students
of Prophecy are agreed that this is the correct meaning of
Rosh. The prince of Rosh, means, therefore, the prince or
king of the Russian empire. But he also is in control of
Meshech and Tubal, which are reproduced in the modern
Moscow and Tobolsk.[33] Russia, we may well conclude from
this, will furnish the man who will lead this confederacy of
nations. We write this at a time when Russia is passing
through horrors upon horrors. A revolution changed the
autocratic government into a democracy and that given
way to anarchy, produced by the satanic treachery of Germany.
From what is written in this chapter we learn that
Russia will ultimately return to the old regime and will once
more become a monarchy to fulfill her final destiny as made
known in this sublime prophecy. Well known it is that
Russia has been in the past the most pronounced and bitterest
enemy of the Jewish people. What she passes through
today is but a fulfillment of what the Lord has spoken:
"I will curse them that curse thee." Today the Jews in
Russian may have bright hopes of getting their rights and
complete emancipation at last. For a time this may come
to pass, but ultimately Russia will turn against them and
like Pharaoh did, when Israel had left his domain, so this
coming King of the North, the prince of Rosh, when Israel
is back in the land, will turn against them.

With him come the other nations. Persia, which is even
now in part occupied by Russia, will finally be a vassal to[259]
this prince of Rosh. Ethiopia and Phut are also in this
confederacy. There also is Gomer and all its bands. Gomer,
says Delitsch, "is most probably the tribe of the Cimmerians,
who dwell, according to Herodotus, on the Maeotis, in the
Taurian Chersonesus, and from whom are descended the
Cumri or Cymry in Wales and Britain, whose relation to
the Germanic Cimbri is still in obscurity." Valuable
information is given in the Talmud; Gomer is there stated
to be the Germani, the Germans. That the descendants
of the Gomer moved northward and established themselves
in parts of Germany seems to be an established
fact. All this is of much interest. Germany did not belong
to the Roman empire, at least the greater part of Germany
was never conquered by Rome. She will therefore not
participate in the Western confederacy. Will she then
become united to Russia and march under the prince of
Rosh into the land of Israel? We cannot be sure about all
these things. This, however, we know, that a powerful
confederacy of nations, under the leadership of the prince
of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal, will come up against Immanuel's
land, when Israel has been restored and dwells
safely.


II. The Disastrous Defeat of the Invaders.

Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto God, Thus saith the
Lord God: In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely,
shalt thou not know it? And thou shalt come from thy place out
of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them
riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army: And thou
shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the
land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against
my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified
in thee, O Gog, before their eyes. Thus saith the Lord God:
Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants
the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days for many
years that I would bring thee against them? And it shall come to[260]
pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of
Israel, saith the Lord God, that my fury shall come up in my face.
For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken.
Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of
Israel: So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven,
and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon
the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth,
shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down,
and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the
ground. And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my
mountains, saith the Lord God: every man's sword shall be against
his brother. And I will plead against him with pestilence and with
blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon
the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great
hailstones, fire and brimstone. Thus will I magnify myself, and
sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations,
and they shall know that I am the Lord (verses 14-23).

The awful fate of the invaders is now prophetically
announced. The prophet is commanded to address Gog.
They know that Israel dwelleth safely and they come to
take the prey, to carry away silver and gold, cattle and
goods and a great spoil (verse 13). The Lord permits it
all so that He might be sanctified and magnified by the
manifestation of His power in judgment, so that through
this judgment the nations might know Him (verses 16, 23).
When they come into the land then His fury will come into
His face. "For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath
have I spoken, surely in that day there shall be a great
shaking in the land of Israel." The next chapter gives the
prophecy of the judgment upon Gog in detail.


THE DEFEAT OF THE INVADERS.

Chapter xxxix.

Once more the prophet is commanded to prophesy against
this final invader of Israel's land and to describe the judgment
which falls upon the Northern army. This chapter concludes
the prophecy of the last enemy of Israel; the concluding[261]
chapters of this book mention no longer enemies, nor Israel's
apostasy. They are taken up with the glory of the
restoration of the nation and the great millennial temple,
the construction, the order of worship, etc.


I. The Judgment and Destruction of Invading Gog.

Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus
saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief
prince of Meshech and Tubal; And I will turn thee back, and leave
but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from
the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:
And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine
arrows to fall out of thy right hand. Thou shalt fall upon the
mountains of Israel, thou and all thy bands, and the people that is
with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort,
and to the beasts of the field to be devoured. Thou shalt fall
upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.
And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell
carelessly in the isles; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people
Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more:
and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in
Israel. Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord God;
this is the day whereof I have spoken. And they that dwell in the
cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the
weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the
arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn
them with fire seven years; so that they shall take no wood out of
the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall
burn the weapons with fire; and they shall spoil those that spoiled
them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord God
(verses 1-10).

Jehovah announces now their complete judgment and
destruction. The invading hordes are permitted to come
upon the mountains of Israel, and like the Assyrian of old,
"Shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of
Zion, the hill of Jerusalem" (Is. x:32). Then the Lord
will act in behalf of His people. Let us remember that the[262]
Lord is then with His people. His glory is with them and
they have found rest and dwell in peace. The blinding power
of Satan, who uses Gog and his companions in a final effort
to dispute the authority of the King of Kings, is demonstrated
by these nations, who, led by the Prince of Rosh (Russia)
invade the land. The nations and their kings forming the
Western Confederacy were equally blinded when, previously
to this final attempt, they made war against the Lord
(Rev. xix:19). Jehovah speaks His "I will;" it is the sovereign
"I will" in judgment. As He spoke to His people
Israel the "I will" of sovereign grace (chapter xxxvi), so
now He speaks the word which seals the doom of Israel's
last enemy. "And I will turn thee back and lead thee on[34]
and will cause thee to come up from the sides of the north,
and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel." There
the invaders are to be smitten. Upon the mountains where
the Lord led them and permitted them to come, the hordes
shall fall and their carcasses will be given to the ravenous
beasts and to the beasts of the field. And those who helped
Gog in the wicked endeavor, who dwell securely in the
isles, who probably assisted them with ships and in other
ways, will also be judged. Fire will be sent upon Magog.
It will be a sweeping judgment. As a result of what takes
place will be the vindication of His holy Name and both
Israel and the nations of the earth shall know Him in that
day. "And my holy name will I make known in the midst
of my people Israel; neither will I suffer my holy name to
be profaned any more; and the nations shall know that I
am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel." And what an
assuring statement is added: "Behold, it cometh, it shall[263]
be done, saith the Lord God; this is the day whereof I have
spoken."

The weapons the invading hordes left behind will be used
for firewood by Israel for seven years. It seems the invaders
carried mostly wooden instruments. Perhaps the
preceding wars exhausted the metals so that they had to
resort to weapons made of wood. Israel shall then spoil
those that spoiled them and rob those that robbed them.


II. The Burial of the Slain.

And it shall come to pass in that day that I will give unto Gog a
place there of a grave in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the
east of the sea; and it shall stop the passengers; and there shall they
bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it The valley
of Hamon-gog. And seven months shall the house of Israel be
burying of them, that they may cleanse the land. Yea, all the
people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown
the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord God. And they
shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the
land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face
of the earth, to cleanse it; after the end of seven months shall
they search. And the passengers that pass through the land, when
any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the
buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog. And also the
name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the
land (verses 11-16).

Gog's delusion was to take Israel's land for a possession.
Territorial aggrandizement was the motive of the invasion,
besides the wicked defiance of God; but instead God gives
them graves in the land of Israel. All the multitude of
Gog will be buried in the valley of the passengers of the
east of the sea, which is the Dead Sea, outside of Israel's
territory; that place will be called then "the valley of
Hamon-gog," which means "the multitude of Gog." Seven
months will it take to put away the bodies of the slain.
And those who pass through that region will stop there[264]
to consider the judgment of the Lord which was executed
upon Gog. It will be a solemn memorial of what God hath
done; even a city will be named on account of the disaster
which has come upon Gog, the city Hamonah. The whole
land will be cleansed of the defilement. Whenever, after
the seven months, one who passes that way sees a man's
bones, he shall mark the place with a sign and the buriers
will put these bones away in Hamon-gog.

The day will surely come when all these events will come
to pass. Much may be obscure at this time but God will
see to the fulfilment in His own time. As we have shown
in the exposition of the previous chapter, Russia is the leader
of this final assault. In these significant days Russia is
in the grasp of anarchy. What will be the outcome? Will
Russia side with Germany? Will the two form a strong
confederacy with other semi-oriental and oriental nations?
Are these things, as seen by the prophet at the river banks
of Chebar, even now preparing? No mortal man can forecast
the immediate future. God alone knows what is
about to come.


III. The Sacrifice of Jehovah.

And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God: Speak unto every
feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves,
and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do
sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of
Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood. Ye shall eat the
flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth,
of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of
Bashan. And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till
ye be drunken, of my sacrifice, which I have sacrificed for you.
Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with
mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord God (verses
17-20).

In view of the great slaughter executed upon Gog and his
vast army, the feathered fowl and every beast of the field[265]
are summoned to attend the sacrifice which Jehovah has
prepared for them upon the mountains of Israel. They
are to eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of
the princes of the earth, which are compared to rams, lambs,
goats, bullocks and the fatlings of Bashan. He promised
these fowls and the beasts of the earth a feast, which will
completely satisfy them. The table which is spread for
them is His table: "Thus shall ye be filled at my table."

Rev. xix:17, 18 contains a similar scene. It is the great
supper of God, which the angel standing in the sun announces,
and to which he invites the fowls in the midst of heaven.
The great supper in Revelation and Jehovah's sacrifice
in Ezekiel are not the same. The great supper of God,
that awful judgment supper, is in connection with the beastly
empire (the Western Confederacy)&mdash;the kings and armies
of apostate Christendom. And probably for this reason the
fowls in the midst of heaven are only mentioned, because
Christendom apostatized from the heavenly testimony
of Christianity. These kings and their armies refused and
rejected completely the invitation of the Lord to the Gospel-supper
and now they will fall in the hands of God and receive
their reward at the judgment supper. When Gog
falls upon the mountains of Israel, the great supper of God
announced in Rev. xix has already been executed.


IV. The Future of Glory.

And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall
see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have
laid upon them. So the house of Israel shall know that I am the
Lord their God from that day and forward. And the nations shall
know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity:
because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from
them and gave them into the hands of their enemies: so fell they
all by the sword. According to their uncleanness and according
to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from[266]
them. Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Now will I bring again
the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of
Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name; after that they have
borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have
trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and
none made them afraid. When I have brought them again from the
people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified
in them in the sight of many nations; then shall they know
that I am the Lord their God, which caused them to be led into
captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto
their own land, and have left none of them any more there.
Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured
out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord God
(verses 21-29).

The moral effect of this judgment is described in verses
21-24. The Lord will then establish His glory among the
nations. From this we learn that the glory of the Lord will
be made known world-wide to cover the earth after this final
invasion has come to pass, and this last judgment of nations
has been executed. The nations will be the witnesses
of this judgment. Of course these nations are those who
have been converted and are embodied in the Kingdom of
Christ. And then the Lord is vindicated for having dealt
with Israel as He did. They went into captivity&mdash;the dispersion
among all the nations of the earth&mdash;on account of
their iniquities. God dealt righteously with them when
on account of their transgressions He hid His face from them.
All God's ways are righteous and in that day all His dealings
in judgment will be openly justified.

Then comes the prophecy of the bright future of Israel.
It is one of the many found in this book of Ezekiel and the
greater number in the other prophetic books. The captivity
of Jacob is ended. Mercy will be bestowed upon the
whole house of Israel. They have borne their shame;
but now it is all ended through the mercy of the Lord.
He will bring them again from the peoples, and gather[267]
them out of the enemies' lands and sanctify them, by taking
away their sins, in the sight of many nations. None will
be left behind; all will be gathered back. It is next to inconceivable
that, with so many promises in the Word of
God as to Israel's future restoration and blessing, that the
greater part of professing Christians can ignore these things
and refuse to believe in a glorious future of the Jewish race.

The last verse contains an important statement. The
Lord says that He hides His face no more from them. This
in itself shows that all this is not yet here; for still He hides
His face from them. The hiding of His face from them will
be no more when His Spirit is poured upon them. "I have
poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the
Lord God." There comes then a time when the house of
Israel, the literal descendants of Abraham, will receive an
outpouring of the Spirit of God. Such is also the message
of Joel, in which restoration and spiritual blessing, through
the outpouring of the Spirit are blended together (Joel ii).[35]
We call attention to another passage which should be linked
with the statement in this chapter. Isaiah xxxii:13-18
is a very striking prophecy. There is an announcement made
first of all concerning the judgment which is to fall upon
Israel's land. "Upon the land of my people shall come
up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in
the joyous city," etc. But this is not to last forever. An
"until" follows. "Until the Spirit be poured upon us from
on high." This is the same future outpouring of the Spirit
of God. Up to now it has not been. The Holy Spirit on
the day of Pentecost came to form the body of Christ,
but this outpouring in connection with Israel has another
significance. We read, therefore, in the above passage what[268]
will happen when this outpouring has come to pass. "And
the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be
counted for a forest. Then judgment shall dwell in the
wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect
of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever. And
my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in
sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places." It is a description
of the Kingdom to come, when Israel has found rest and
when all the earth will receive the blessing, when righteousness
will have given peace, lasting peace to the world.

THE MILLENNIAL TEMPLE AND ITS WORSHIP.
THE LAND AND ITS GLORY.

Chapters xl-xlviii.

The final nine chapters of this book form the climax
of the great prophecies of Ezekiel; they belong to the most
difficult in the entire prophetic Word. Once more the hand
of the Lord rests upon the seer and in the visions of God
he is brought into the land of Israel. In the very beginning
of this grand finale we learn therefore that the visions concern
the land of Israel. Let us remember that after the fall
of Jerusalem had been announced to Ezekiel (chapter
xxxiii:21), his prophetic utterances and visions concern
the future when Israel is to be regathered and restored to the
land. The previous two chapters dealt with the last invasion
of the land of Israel and the complete overthrow of Gog and
its hordes. The vision contained in this last section follows
after Israel's final deliverance. So much is clear as to the
time when the prophecies of these eight chapters will be
accomplished. They have not been fulfilled in the past,
certainly not in the remnant which returned under Zerubabbel
and Ezra. Nor have these prophecies been fulfilled
since then. All is future. Only when the Lord has gathered
Judah and Israel, when He has established His glorious
Kingdom in their midst and delivered His people and the
land from the last invader, will this last vision of Ezekiel
become history.

This disposes then at once of the different modes of interpretation
employed by so many expositors of this book.
These are the following:

1. The theory of interpretation which looks upon the
vision of these chapters as fulfilled in the return of the
remnant from Babylon. One of the expositors who follows
this line stated that these visions are "an ideal representation[272]
of the Jewish state about to be restored after the captivity."
It does not need much argument to show that this mode of
interpretation is erroneous. The temple which the remnant
built does in no way whatever correspond with the magnificent
structure which Ezekiel beheld in his vision. The
fact is, if this temple is a literal building (as it assuredly is)
it has never yet been erected. Furthermore, it is distinctly
stated that the glory of the Lord returned to the temple
and made His dwelling place there, the same glory which
Ezekiel had seen departing from the temple and from
Jerusalem. But the glory did not return to the second
temple. No glory cloud filled that house. And furthermore
no high priest is mentioned in the worship of the temple
Ezekiel describes, but the Jews after their return from
Babylon had high priests again. Nor can the stream of
healing waters flowing from the temple as seen by Ezekiel
be in any way applied to the restoration from the Babylonian
captivity. Expositors who follow this mode of interpretation
claim that all has been fulfilled and that there is nothing
in store for Israel in the future. It is the most superficial
method and totally wrong.

2. Another interpretation claims that the whole vision
sprang from the imagination of the prophet. That all is
an ideal description of something which the expositor
himself is unable to define. This mode of interpretation
needs no further mention and answer.

3. The third interpretation of these chapters is the allegorical
which spiritualizes everything and claims that the
Christian church, its earthly glory and blessing, is symbolically
described by the prophet. This is the weakest of all
and yet the most accepted. But this theory gives no exposition
of the text, is vague and abounds in fanciful applications,
while the greater part of this vision is left unexplained[273]
even in its allegorical meaning, for it evidently has no such
meaning at all.[36]

The true interpretation is the literal one which looks upon
these chapters as a prophecy yet unfulfilled and to be
fulfilled when Israel has been restored by the Shepherd and
when His glory is once more manifested in the midst of His
people. The great building seen in his prophetic vision will
then come into existence and all will be accomplished.

But while we are sure of the strictly future fulfillment of
this final vision, the many details which abound in these
chapters can hardly be fully interpreted as to their meaning.
Much is obscure. That all has a deeper meaning we do
not doubt; and here and there we shall offer suggestions,
but many things we shall have to pass over. Before we turn
to the text and open up the contents of these chapters, a
telescopic view of the whole section is in order and will be
helpful in our further studies.

We call attention first to the three main divisions.

THE TEMPLE VISION.

Chapter xl.

The Temple vision is first recorded and the opening verses
form the introduction.


I. The Introduction to the Temple Vision.

In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of
the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after
that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord
was upon me, and brought me thither. In the visions of God
brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high
mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.[276]
And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose
appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax
in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes,
and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall
shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art
thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of
Israel (verses 1-4).

The time of the vision is first given by the prophet. It was
in the fourteenth year after Jerusalem had been smitten,
which would make the date 572 B. C. The beginning of
the year is mentioned. In the Hebrew a word is employed
(Rosh hashanah) which is not used again in the Old Testament.
In Exodus xii we read "this month shall be unto you
the beginnings of months, it shall be the first month of the
year to you." (Abib or Nisan.) Some expositors claim that
the beginning of the year in Ezekiel's vision was in the month
of Nisan commemorating the Passover. But it may mean
the seventh month (September-October) the feast of
trumpets from which the Jews reckon the new year, and the
first day of the month would be the day of atonement.
We incline to the latter view. Both the feast of trumpets and
the day of atonement foreshadow the regathering of Israel
and the forgiveness of their sins. And when that has come
then, and not before, Ezekiel's glory vision will be accomplished
in the land. We also read in Lev. xxv:9: "Then
shalt thou cause the trumpet of jubilee to sound on the
tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement
shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout your land."
It will be the time of Israel's jubilee when this temple,
Ezekiel beheld, will be erected in their land. Once more
the hand of the Lord rested upon the prophet. It is the
seventh time that this happened to Ezekiel, and not again
after this. (See chapters. i:3, iii:14-22, vii:1, xxxiii:22,
xxxvii:1, xl:1.) In the visions of God the prophet was[277]
brought into the land of Israel, which is conclusive evidence
that the vision he is about to receive concerns the people
Israel and not, as the spritualizing, allegorical school
of interpreters claim, the church. Ezekiel knew nothing
whatever of the church and therefore not a line of all his
prophecies could intelligently be applied to the church
of the Lord Jesus Christ. He finds himself upon a very
high mountain; towards the south he noticed the frame
(or building) of a city.[37] The high mountain is, no doubt,
the mountain frequently mentioned in the prophetic Word.
"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain
of the Lord's house shall be established in the top
of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills and
all nations shall flow unto it" (Isaiah ii:2). "Beautiful
for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion,
on the sides of the north the city of the great King" (Ps.
xlviii:2). It is the place of His rest (Ps. cxxxii:14), where
the King is enthroned (Ps. ii).



Then appeared in the vision the man with the line of
flax and the measuring reed. Zachariah beheld such a man
with a measuring line in his hand to measure Jerusalem
(Zech. ii:13). In Rev. xxi:15 we read of the heavenly Jerusalem,
that wonderful city, "and he that talked with me had
a golden reed to measure the city and the gates thereof
and the wall thereof." And then follows the measurement
of the city. The one who measured in Revelation was an
angel and the measure was that of an angel. We shall
make, when we come to the measurement itself, a brief
comparison between the measure mentioned by Ezekiel and
the measure of the city in Revelation. And the man with[278]
the measuring reed stood in the gate. He addressed the
prophet once more as "Son of Man." He was to give attention
to all. His eyes were to see, his ears to hear, he
should set his heart upon all that would be shown unto
him and declare it to the house of Israel.


II. The Eastern Gate.

And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in
the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit
and an hand breadth; so he measured the breadth of the building,
one reed, and the height, one reed. Then came he unto the gate
which looked toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and
measured the threshold of the gate which was one reed broad;
and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.
And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad;
and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold
of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed. He
measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed. Then
measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts
thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward. And
the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side,
and three on that side; they three were of one measure; and the
posts had one measure on this side and on that side. And he
measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the
length of the gate, thirteen cubits. The space also before the
little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one
cubit on that side; and the little chambers were six cubits on this
side, and six cubits on that side. He measured then the gate from
the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another; the breadth
was five and twenty cubits, door against door. He made also posts
of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about
the gate. And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the
face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits. And there
were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts
within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and
windows were round about inward; and upon each post were
palm trees (verses 5-16).

The house mentioned is the whole building of the Temple.
A wall was round about the building. A wall is also mentioned[279]
in chapter xlii:20 which had a length of five hundred
reeds and a breadth of five hundred reeds. The purpose of
that wall is stated "to make a separation between that which
was holy and that which was common." This wall of five
hundred is not identical with the wall in the beginning of
the vision as mentioned in verse 5. The wall here surrounded
the outer court; the wall in chapter xlii:20 surrounds the
whole temple area. That is why the separation between
the holy and the common is spoken of with that wall. The
length of the great wall which enclosed all the Temple area
is not given. But the man in the vision measures the breadth
and the height, and as the reed is six cubits we have 2x6
(breadth six cubits and height six cubits), which gives us
the number 12. So we meet the number 12, the symbol
of divine government on the threshold of this vision. How
prominent the number 12 is in the description of the heavenly
Jerusalem in the last book of the Bible (Rev. xxi) is known
to every reader of that book. The wall there has 12 gates
and 12 foundations and is 12x12 cubits high, that is 144
cubits. All is perfection in that heavenly Jerusalem.
Here in Ezekiel we have the description of the earthly
sanctuary which will be in existence during the millennium.
While in Revelation the one who measures is an angel
with a golden reed, it is a man in Ezekiel and the cubit
he uses (the length of the human forearm from the elbow
to the tip of the little finger) has a handbreadth added.
The eastern gate, the little chambers, the porch, etc.&mdash;everything
is measured. The lesson is that even to the details
everything is here by divine appointment. If the reed
mentioned frequently is taken as six cubits we have in the
measure the number 12 several times. Every little chamber
(guard houses) was one reed long (six cubits) and six cubits
broad&mdash;twice 6&mdash;12. That all this must have a deeper meaning
we doubt not; and yet who can at this time give it to us[280]
in full? These instructions will be literally followed and
carried out in the coming day of Israel's restoration.

In these verses we find the wall and its construction,
surrounding the outer court of this future temple described.
Three gates were seen by the prophet in this wall&mdash;an
Eastern gate, a Northern gate (verse 10) and a Southern
gate (verse 24). The West side of the wall has no gate.
As we learn later the returning glory of the Lord will enter
the temple by the Eastern gate. Seven steps lead up to
these gates. Seven is the number of divine perfection and
accomplishment. These gates must not be thought of as
mere openings in the wall; they are gateways forming
separate buildings which project into the outer court to a
distance of fifty cubits with a breadth of twenty-five cubits.
On both sides of these gateways the prophet saw six little
chambers, three on each side, and each six cubits square.
There has been much speculation as to the possible use of
these little chambers and their meaning. The Hebrew
word used here is the same as in 1 Kings xiv:28, translated
in this passage "guard-chamber." This may be the purpose
of these chambers in the gateway building of this first wall.
This seems to be confirmed by chapter xliv:11 and 14,
which speaks of the Levites having charge of the gates of
the house, so that in all probability these guard-chambers
will be in charge of the Levites. Let us also notice the
prominence of the numbers three and twelve. There are
2x3 guard-chambers in each gateway both in the outer
court and also in the inner court. This gives us thirty-six
guard-chambers, or 3x12. The number three means
symbolically fullness, a divine fullness, and twelve stands
for divine sovereignty and government. Three times
twelve means, therefore, divine fullness in sovereign power
and government. God Himself will be the guardian and
protector of this millennial sanctuary of His earthly people.[281]

Mention is made also of a porch in connection with each
gateway. This porch of the gate is inward, and it must be
thought of in the form of a hall. Such a porch-hall is mentioned
in the architecture of Solomon's temple (1 Kings
vi:3; 2 Chron. iii:4; see also Joel ii:17). These vestibule
halls are the termination of the gateway leading into the
outer court itself. The porch-hall of the significant Eastern
gate is reserved for the Prince. He enters by way of the
porch of that gate and goes out the same way (chapter
xliv:3). And there is a door for each gate, for we read that
the East gate was to be shut (xliv:1-2). The door at the
termination of the gateway is mentioned in verse 11. The
width of the doorway is ten cubits and the height of the
door itself thirteen cubits&mdash;10x3. The number ten signifies
responsibility, and three, as already stated, is symbolical
of divine fullness. Then posts were seen by the prophet.
Each gateway had two posts and each post is two cubits
thick and sixty cubits high (verses 9, 14). Critics have declared
that the given dimension of sixty cubits is impossible.
We do not know why this should be declared impossible.
Some critics have said that the man could not have measured
these sixty cubits; but the word measure is not used at
all. The windows of the little chambers will be closed
windows. Upon the posts were palm trees. These palm
trees were ornamental and artificial (xl:18). That palms
are prominent in this millennial temple, crowning first of all
the high posts, which towered above all, so that the palms
were seen, is not without significance. Palms are the symbols
of victory. Branches of palm trees were also used
during the celebration of the feast of tabernacles, which
dispensationally foreshadows the millennial age of blessing
and glory. And that is why palms are lifted high above
everything on the gateway pillars of the wall surrounding
the outer court. The time of blessing, victory, peace and
glory has come.[282]

We follow the prophet now into the inner court. This court
is smaller, exactly one hundred cubits square (verse 47).
In the center of this four square court stands the great
altar, eighteen cubits square and twelve cubits high (chap.
xliii:13-17). West of this great altar is a higher terrace
upon which the temple itself stands. The approach to this
inner court is also through three gates corresponding to the
three gates in the wall surrounding the outer court. We
must notice, however, that there are eight steps in connection
with the gateways leading into this inner court, while
the gateways leading into the outer court had only seven
steps. The number eight is symbolical of the new covenant
and the new creation.[38] This great place of worship, by
these eight steps, which lead to the interior, has the mark
of the new age, the age when all things are made new.
These gateways have also the little chambers like in the gateways
of the outer court. The prophet in his vision entered
by the South gate; then he came next to the East gate
(verse 32), and finally to the North gate (verse 35); and
these three gateways had their arches, posts and palm
trees upon the posts. All is symmetrical. These three gateways
are seen in line with the gateways of the outer court,
but the porches were not towards the inside, but at the
other end next to the outer court. In measurement and
everything else they correspond to the gateways leading
into the outer court.

The description of the great altar which stands in the[283]
middle of the inner court is given later; we shall follow it
when we come to the text. The sacrifices are to be brought
in this inner court and therefore we find next the sacrificial
tables mentioned on which the burnt offering, the sin offering
and the trespass offering will be slain. Two tables
were in the porch of the gate on this side and two on the
other side. Then at the steps of the gate on both sides
were two tables, four tables on the one side and four on
the other. In all there are eight tables whereupon to
slay sacrifices. Besides these, there are four smaller tables
of hewn stone, especially for the burnt offering, whereupon
they also lay the instruments used in slaying the sacrifices.
This gives 3x4 tables&mdash;twelve which are grouped on both
sides of the steps, along the sides of the gateway and in the
porch. On these tables the sacrifices are slain, washed and
otherwise prepared and the smaller tables are for the instruments.
Are these twelve tables only at one gate or at all the
gates? There is reason to believe that each of the gateways
leading to the inner courts is furnished with these sacrificial
tables. If this is correct we have again the significant
numbers and combination 3x12, corresponding to the
guard-chambers at the three gateways, which also are 3x12.

Besides the chambers and the entries to the gates where
they washed the sacrifices (verse 38) there are without the
inner gate chambers at each gate for the singers and the
priests (verses 44-46) who are the keepers of the house.
These chambers were evidently detached from the gateways
and yet near by. No measurement of these chambers is
given. The inner court itself was a hundred cubits square;
in the outer was the great altar.


V. The Vestibule of the Temple.

And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured
each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on
that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this[284]
side, and three cubits on that side. The length of the porch was
twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and he brought me
by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by
the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

These closing verses of this chapter introduce us to the
temple building. The prophet is brought in vision to the
porch of the house. The vestibule in which the prophet
finds himself is twenty cubits long and eleven cubits broad.[39]
The number ten is here seen again two by ten. The number
of the steps leading up to the vestibule of the temple are not
given. Besides the posts of the vestibule there are two
pillars also, one on each side of the entrance gate, which
remind us of the two pillars "Jachin and Boaz" in Solomon's
temple (1 Kings vii:21, 45). Many of these details are
obscure, their deeper and symbolical meaning hidden.
It would be an easy matter to make all kinds of spiritual
applications. As to such applications one has well said,
"We need a vigilant watch lest we pervert the holy Word
of God; and I trust myself to be reticent rather than thus
offend." The construction the measurements and arrangement
tell out divine perfection. When at last this great
millennial temple is erected in Israel's land, it will be a
glorious witness for the Lord and as the central place of
earthly worship worthy of that coming age of peace and glory.
[285]

THE HOLY AND MOST HOLY. THE SIDE BUILDING
AND THE INTERIOR.

Chapter xli.

The man with the measuring reed had gradually introduced
in the vision Ezekiel to the outer wall and outer and inner
court of this great future temple. The chambers, posts,
gateways, sacrificial tables, etc., were all described in detail
and so the prophet was brought into the temple vestibule
(xl:48-49) to be led on into the temple itself. He beholds
now the Holy place, the Most Holy, the side buildings, the
hinder buildings and the interior of the temple.


I. The Holy Place and the Most Holy.

Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,
six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other
side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle. And the breadth of
the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits
on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured
the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.
Then went he inward, and measured each post of the door, two
cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door,
seven cubits. So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits;
and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said
unto me, This is the most holy place (verses 1-4.)

III. The Outer Court.

Then brought he me into the outward court and, lo, there were
chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty
chambers were upon the pavement. And the pavement by the side
of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.
Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the
lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred
cubits eastward and northward. And the gate of the outward
court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof,
and the breadth thereof. And the little chambers thereof were
three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof
and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate:[286]
the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and
twenty cubits. And their windows, and their arches, and their
palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward
the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches
thereof were before them. And the gate of the inner court was
over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and
he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits. After that he
brought me toward the south: and behold a gate toward the south:
and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according
to these measures. And there were windows in it and in the
arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty
cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. And there were
seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them:
and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side,
upon the posts thereof. And there was a gate in the inner court
toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the
south an hundred cubits (verses 17-27.)

The man with the measuring line now leads the prophet
into the outer court itself. He had passed through the East
gate and has now the vision of the outer court. Here again
he beholds chambers. The word used for chamber is a
different word from the one used in verses 7, 10, 12, 13, 16,
21, 29, 33 and 36. The chambers of the outer court are no
longer guard-rooms. The word used here is found in 1 Sam.
ix:22, which was not a small chamber by any means, inasmuch
as thirty persons could be accommodated. The word
is used later for the chambers in which the priests kept the
tithes and offerings. Such chambers were in the temple
of Solomon. In the millennial temple they probably will
serve the same purpose. Then we read of a pavement
made for the court round about. It is a pavement of
stones (see 2 Kings xvi:17; 2 Chron. vii:3; Esther i:6&mdash;the
same Hebrew word is used in these passages). This pavement,
probably in the form of a mosaic arrangement,
covers the entire outer court and of the chambers were
thirty upon the pavement. Where are these chambers[287]
located? Are they together or scattered over the entire
outer court? We believe they will be located alongside
of each gateway, two on the side of the East gate, two
at the North gate and two at the South gate. This seems to
be the correct location, for the prophet in having stepped
through the gateway into the outer court sees these chambers
first, so that they must have been at the entrance gate.
The measurement follows and the North gate and South
gate are described. They compare in every way to the
East gate, each having its seven steps, its little chambers
(guard-chambers) its posts and palm trees.


IV. The Inner Court, the Sacrificial Tables and the
Chambers.

And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
measured the south gate according to these measures; And the little
chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according
to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the
arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and
twenty cubits broad. And the arches round about were five and
twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. And the arches thereof
were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon the posts
thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps. And he brought
me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate
according to these measures. And the little chambers thereof,
and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, were according to
these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches
thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty
cubits broad. And the arches thereof were toward the outward
court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side,
and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps. And he
brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these
measures; The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the
arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was
fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. And the
posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm trees were
upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going
up to it had eight steps. And the chambers and the entries thereof[288]
were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt
offering. And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this
side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering
and the sin offering and the trespass offering. And at the side
without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two
tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate,
were two tables. Four tables were on this side, and four tables
on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they
slew their sacrifices. And the four tables were of hewn stone for
the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and a
half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the
instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round
about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering. And
without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner
court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect
was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the
prospect toward the north. And he said unto me, This chamber,
whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers
of the charge of the house. And the chamber, whose prospect is
toward the north, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the
altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which
come near to the Lord to minister unto him. So he measured the
court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare;
and the altar that was before the house (verses 28-47).

The first two verses give the measurement of the Holy
part. Of the contents of this part, how it was furnished,
nothing is said; only the measurement is mentioned. The
place is forty cubits long and twenty cubits broad. In this
respect it corresponds to the temple of Solomon in which the
Holy place had the same dimensions, while the same part in
the wilderness tabernacle was only twenty cubits by ten
cubits. We find therefore that the Holy part in the temple of
Solomon and Ezekiel's temple is double the size of the Holy
part of the tabernacle. There is a door which leads from
the vestibule into this Holy place and at both sides are door
posts, six cubits broad on the one side and six on the other;
between these two posts is the door, the breadth of which is[289]
ten cubits.[40] The number twelve is again in evidence in these
two posts, twice six. Inasmuch as the wall (verse 5) is six
cubits thick these two posts are probably a part of the wall
surrounding the temple. Later we receive the additional
information that the waters issued from under the threshold
of the house eastward, the seer being at this door (xlvii:1).

Then the man went inward, into the Most Holy. This was
a perfect square twenty cubits long and twenty broad. Let
us notice that the prophet here does not enter the place, for
it is the Most Holy, the dwelling place of Jehovah.

The man entered in alone, while the prophet remained
outside. There was a door six cubits high and seven cubits
broad. The breadth of the door leading into the Holy part
was ten cubits, but the door leading into the Most Holy was
seven cubits broad, the number which denotes divine perfection.
The description of the interior of the temple is
given in verses 15-26.


II. The Side Buildings.

After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the
breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house
on every side. And the side chambers were three, one over another,
and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the
house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold,
but they had not hold in the wall of the house. And there was an
enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers:
for the winding about of the house went still upward round about
the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and
so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.
I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of
the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. The thickness
of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five
cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers
that were within. And between the chambers was the wideness of[290]
twenty cubits round about the house on every side. And the doors
of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one
door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and
the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about
(verses 5-11).

He measured first the wall which surrounded the Holy and
the Most Holy part. This wall was six cubits. Then there
are side chambers. Such side chambers were also in the
temple of Solomon (1 Kings vi:5). There are three stories
and each contains thirty chambers, so there are ninety
chambers in all. These three stories with the ninety chambers
surrounded the temple on its three sides, the North, West and
South sides, the East side being the vestibule and entrance
into the temple; no side chambers are found above this
entrance. These side chambers enter into the wall, that they
might have hold and still they have not hold of the wall itself.
In this also the temple corresponds to the arrangement of
Solomon's temple. 1 Kings vi:6 explains the construction of
these chambers: "On the outside he made rebatements
in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should
not have hold in the wall of the house." The side chambers
in the Solomonic temple were fastened on the house with
timber of cedar (1 Kings vi:10). This probably explains
the meaning of the attachment of these three stories of
chambers in Ezekiel's temple. The side chambers must
therefore be considered as an addition to the wall itself which
surrounds the Holy and Most Holy. We do not know what
will be the use of these ninety chambers in the millennial
temple. The seventh verse shows that the stories of this
addition to the wall, containing the chambers, have galleries
round about. And the gallery of the second story is broader
than the gallery of the first, and the gallery of the third is
broader than the second story, so that this annex broadens
upward. The expression "winding about" has led some of the[291]
few expositors of these chapters to identify with the winding
stairs of the Solomonic temple (1 Kings vi:8); but this is
incorrect. The text does not mention a staircase at all.
A better rendering of verse 8 is: "And I saw that the house
had an elevation round about, the foundations of the side
chambers, a full reed, six cubits to the joint."[41] There was
then a raised basement on the three sides of the temple and
the six cubits correspond to the ten steps (xl:49) marking the
height of the elevation. Verse 9 shows that the thickness of
the wall, which was for the side chambers without was five
cubits, besides this there was a free place along the building.
"And between the chambers (and the house) was a width of
twenty cubits round about the house on every side." This
afforded the proper light for these chambers. "And the
entry of the side chambers was toward what was left free,
one entry toward the North, and one entry toward the
South; and the width of the space left free was five cubits
round about." The side chambers were therefore entered
from the outside.


III. The Hinder Building&mdash;The Total Measurement.

Now the building that was before the separate place at the end
toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the
building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof
ninety cubits. So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long;
and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof,
an hundred cubits long; also the breadth of the face of the house,
and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.
And he measured the length of the building over against the separate
place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the
one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner
temple, and the porches of the court (verses 12-15).

Here a new building comes into view which is behind the[292]
temple building toward the West. Its dimensions are seventy
cubits broad, ninety cubits long and the wall is five cubits
in thickness round about. The use of this building is not
stated. Its use is probably for the disposal of the refuse
from the sacrifices and other unclean things. No other
description is given of this hinder building, this separate
place. Verses 12 and 14 give the total measurement of the
house, a hundred cubits, which is the total of the previously
given measures.


IV. The Interior of the Temple Described.

The thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round
about on their three stories, over against the door, ceiled with wood
round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the
windows were covered; to that above the entry, even unto the
inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within
and without, all was by measure. And it was made with cherubim
and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a
cherub; and every cherub had two faces; so that the face of a man
was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young
lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through
all the house round about. From the ground unto above the door
were cherubim and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.
The posts of the temple were squared, and the front of the sanctuary
had the same appearance. The altar was of wood three cubits high,
and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the
length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said
unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord. And the temple
and the sanctuary had two doors. And the doors had two leaves,
two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves
for the other door. And there were made on them, on the doors
of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made upon
the walls; and there was a wooden portal in front of the porch
without. And closed windows and palm trees on the one side and
on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side
chambers of the house, and the portals[42] (verses 16-26).
[293]
From verse 16 we learn that all was wainscoted with wood.
The altar was also of wood. It is significant that silver and
gold, so prominent in the tabernacle in the wilderness and
in Solomon's temple, are entirely absent in the millennial
temple. The words "silver and gold" are not mentioned
once in Ezekiel xl-xlviii. Silver typifies grace in redemption,
being the ransom money. Gold typifies divine righteousness.
Both are absent in the millennial temple for what the silver
and gold foreshadows is now realized in His redeemed earthly
people. The heavenly Jerusalem has gold in it, but silver is
not mentioned in the description of the city in Revelation xxi.

The chief ornaments in this temple are cherubim and palm
trees; they were along the wall of the temple. So it was in
the temple of Solomon. "And he carved all the walls of the
house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm
trees and open flowers within and without" (1 Kings vi:29).

A palm tree was between cherub and cherub. As stated in
the previous chapter palms are the emblems of victory and
remind us of the feast of tabernacles. They were seen high
above on the posts. Cherubim speak of the presence of the
Lord, who enters this house and is worshipped here. But
the cherubim here have only two faces and not four as in the
opening vision of this book (chapter i:10-12). As often
stated, these celestial beings tell out the Lord Jesus Christ in
His personal glory. The lion, His kingly glory; the face of a
man, His true humanity; the face of an ox, His servant character;
and the face of an eagle. His heavenly origin and destiny,
Son of God. It is not without meaning that the face of a man
and the face of a young lion are seen on these cherubim and
each face looks upon a palm tree. Its symbolical meaning is
obvious. The Lord Jesus Christ has come again and visited
the earth and the temple and appeared as the glorified Man
and the Lion of the tribe of Judah. His is the victory and the
glory. When at last this temple stands in Israel's land, and[294]
its meaning and measurements, as well as other details, are
fully known and understood, it will be known then that His
blessed work, victory and person are symbolically seen
throughout this house.

The altar was of wood, three cubits high and two cubits
long. "And he said unto me, This is the table which is before
Jehovah." The altar is the altar of incense. The burnt
offering altar is described in chapter xliii:13, etc. In the
tabernacle and Solomon's temple the altar of incense was
overlaid with gold. Note also the difference in the measurement.
The altar of incense in the tabernacle was two cubits
high and one cubit long and broad; the altar in the future
temple is three cubits high and two cubits long, nearly double
in size. The incense offered upon the altar is the symbol of
the fragrance Christ is to God. It also typifies praise and
prayer (Ps. cxli:2; Rev. v:8; viii:3); being communion with
God it is here called "the table which is before Jehovah."
How great will be the fragrance of Christ, and the praise and
worship God will receive, in this great house of worship!

There were also two doors for the sanctuary with two turning
leaves. They were ornamented, like the walls, with cherubim
and palm trees.


THE CELLS FOR THE PRIESTS.

Chapter xlii.

This chapter gives the description of the chambers or
cells of the priests and closes with the final measurements
of this temple. After this, as recorded in the next chapter,
the prophet beheld the return of the glory of the Lord and
how He entered the house.


I. The Description of the Cells for the Priests.

Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward
the north: and he brought me into the cells that was over against[295]
the separate place, and which was before the building toward the
north. Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north
door, and the breadth was fifty cubits. Over against the twenty
cubits which pertained to the inner court, and over against the pavement
which pertained to the outer court, was gallery against gallery
in three stories. And before the cells was a walk of ten cubits
breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the
north. Now the upper cells were shorter: for the galleries were
higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the
building. For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the
pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more
than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. And the
wall that was without over against the cells, toward the outer
court on the forepart of the cells, the length thereof was fifty
cubits: For the length of the cells that were in the outer court was
fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits. And
from under these cells was the entry on the east side, as one goeth
into them from the outer court. The cells were in the thickness of
the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate
place, and over against the building. And the way before them
was like the appearance of the cells which were toward the north,
as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were
both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
And according to the doors of the cells, that were toward
the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly
before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them
(verses 1-12).

Once more the man leads forth the prophet. The Holy
part and the Most Holy had been measured and described
and now he leaves the innermost part and is led again into
the outer court. He goes on towards the North and faces a
cell-building over against the separate place. This separate
place is the hinder building described in chapter xli:12.
There are three such cell-buildings, one on the North and the
other on the South; that is, facing the two sides of the hinder
building in the separate place. The third cell-building is at
the East-gate. The entrance to these cell buildings is from
the outer court. The measurement given presents considerable[296]
difficulty which we do not attempt to solve. Each
of these buildings has three stories and before each is a walk
of ten cubits. We also learn that the upper story of cells
is shorter than the first and second stories; this corresponds
in architecture to the side buildings described in chapter
xli:5-11. How many cells or chambers are in each of these
buildings is not stated.


II. For What the Cells are Used.

Then said he unto me, The north cells and the south chambers,
which are before the separate place, they be holy cells, where the
priests that approach unto the Lord shall eat the most holy things:
there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering,
and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.
When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy
place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments
wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other
garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the
people (verses 13-14).

The cells on the North and South, facing the separate
place are especially mentioned as being holy chambers.
Here the priests who approach unto the Lord are to eat the
most holy things and there they shall lay the most holy
things, the meal offering, the sin offering and the trespass
offering. They were set apart for this purpose. For this
reason at the end of these two cell-buildings towards the
west were the places where the offerings were boiled and
the meal offering baked. They were the kitchens of the
priests. Of this we read in chapter xlvi:19, 20: "Then he
brought me through the passage which was at the side of the
gate, into the holy cells which were for the priests, which
looked toward the North; and behold a place was there at
the end westward. And he said unto me, This is the
place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and
the sin offering and where they shall bake the meal offering,[297]
that they bring them not out into the outer court, so as to
hallow the people." In these chambers they put the garments
of their ministry. The priests are not to wear their
holy garments outside of the inner court lest they should
be profaned. Why these Levitical ordinances are maintained
in the millennial temple with a priesthood still
ministering, the purpose of all this, we shall take up more
fully in the exposition of the chapters which follow.


III. Final Measurement.

Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he
brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east,
and measured it round about. He measured the east side with the
measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round
about. He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the
measuring reed round about. He measured the south side, five
hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. He measured
the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds
with the measuring reed. He measured it by the four sides: it
had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred
broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane
place (verses 15-20).

The measuring of the inner house completed, the prophet
is led back to the starting point, the gate that is toward the
East. In this final measurement four times five hundred
reeds are mentioned. The east side, north side, south side,
and west side, each is measured as being five hundred reeds.
This passage has occasioned much controversy. The question
is if five hundred cubits or five hundred reeds is correct.
If we take the reed to be ten feet it would mean
that the temple is five thousand feet on each side. But that
seems impossible in view of the previous measurement. The
Septuagint translators realized this difficulty and took the
liberty of changing the word "reeds" to "cubits." If
cubits is right then it would agree with all the previous[298]
measurements, hence many of the commentators have
changed the reeds to cubits. But what authority is there
to make this change? The Hebrew word for reeds is "gonim"
and cubit is "ammah," two entirely different words. A
copyist's error is therefore excluded. We maintain that
measurement is five hundred reeds and that the text is
correct.

But what is measured? Certainly not the temple area
with its wall, outer court and Holy and the Most Holy. What
is measured here is the territory which surrounds the whole
temple buildings. If we retrace the steps of the man who
measured and led along Ezekiel we see him leaving the Most
Holy; they then go back into the Holy part, the outer court
and then passing through the eastern gate through which
they had entered, they are both outside of the outer wall.
They are now in a very large space surrounding the temple
buildings, and this space is measured. Furthermore we find
that there was an immense wall surrounding this enclosure:
this wall separated between that which is holy and what is
common (verse 20). Another difficulty has been mentioned
by expositors if this measurement of five hundred reeds is
correct. They say it is far too large for Mount Moriah,
the chosen place of the temple. There is no difficulty here
at all, for we read, "And it shall come to pass in the last days
that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established
in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the
hills and all nations shall flow unto it" (Isa. ii:2). When the
Lord returns and His Kingdom will be established great
physical changes take place in Israel's land, changes which
no one can fully understand.[43] The mountain upon which
this temple is to be built is a very high mountain, which
comes into existence when the earth and the heavens will[299]
be shaken. The temple was a holy square of five hundred
cubits, in another square of five hundred reeds. Later we
shall find that there is another holy portion of the land
which surrounds the temple, and the territory of five hundred
reeds square, and that portion was of an extremely large
dimension, that is, twenty-five thousand reeds in length
and ten thousand reeds in breadth.[44] All this would not
be possible in the present Palestine; but it will be made
possible through the changes of that coming day (Is. ii:12;
xxiv:3-4; 19-23).


THE RETURNING GLORY. THE ALTAR AND THE
WORSHIP.

Chapter xliii.

The plan of the entire temple with its buildings, walls
and the surrounding territory having been revealed and
fully recorded in the preceding chapters, greater things are
now shown to the prophet. It concerns the temple and the
service which is to be maintained in this magnificent house
of worship. In the present chapter we find first a description
of the return of the glory of the Lord to the house, filling
the house. This is followed by a message delivered by the
Lord; speaking out of the house; the message is addressed
to the prophet, who is also to speak to the house of Israel
concerning their condition and the law of the house. The
dimensions of the great altar are given and how that altar
is to be consecrated. This is the first great service in this
temple.


I. The Return of the Glory of the Lord.

Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh
toward the east: And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came
from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many[300]
waters: and the earth shined with his glory. And it was according
to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the
vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions
were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon
my face. And the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way
of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. So the spirit took
me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory
of the Lord filled the house (verses 1-5).

The man leads him back to the eastern gate through which
they had entered first when the house was measured. And
here he beholds a startling event. Up to this point the house
with it buildings had been seen in silent grandeur. No
sound was heard; nothing was seen. But as they stand at
the gate toward the east, suddenly the glory of the God of
Israel came from the way of the east. Then the voice of
Jehovah was heard as the sound of many waters and the
earth shined with His glory. The dedication of the house by
the return of the Lord with His glory is now to take place.
Thus the tabernacle in the wilderness was dedicated (Exodus
xl:34-35). "A cloud covered the tent of the congregation
and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle." The
same happened when Solomon had finished the temple.
"The cloud filled the house of the Lord, so that the priests
could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the
glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord" (1 Kings
viii:10-11; 2 Chron. v:13, 14; vii:1-3). The Lord with
His glory entered into these prepared places and in like
manner He will enter the great temple Ezekiel beheld in his
prophetic vision. Such a return of the glory of the God
of Israel to dwell in another temple has not yet taken place.
When the returned remnant after the proclamation of Cyrus
had rebuilt the temple, no cloud filled the house nor was the
glory of the Lord seen. Some apply this vision to the time
when our Lord was on earth and that it was fulfilled when
He entered the temple. This needs no further refutation,[301]
but it shows how much at sea expositors of the Word of
God are who reject the future restoration of Israel. When
the Lord was on earth He had laid His visible glory by and
was rejected by the nation. This vision of glory will be
fulfilled when He returns the second time in power and glory;
then and never before will this visible glory be displayed
and His glory will shine over Israel's land and finally cover
the earth as the waters cover the deep.

We must notice here especially that the vision the prophet
beheld was "according to the appearance of the vision"
he saw before the destruction of the city "the visions were
like the visions" which he saw "by the river Chebar."
This points back to the first chapter when first by the river
Chebar the heavens were opened to Ezekiel the priest, and
he saw visions of God. At the close of that chapter we read
after the recorded vision, "This was the appearance of the
likeness of the glory of the Lord." The same vision of glory
appeared again to him when Ezekiel had left the river
Chebar and gone into the plain (iii:22-23). Then he had
witnessed the gradual and solemn departure of the glory
of the Lord. "Then the glory of the Lord departed from
off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up
from the earth in my sight.... They stood at the
door of the east gate of the house of the Lord, and the glory
of the God of Israel was over them above" (x:18-19). Then
finally the Shekinah went up and disappeared. "And
the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and
stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city"
(xi:22).

The similarity of the departure of the glory of the Lord
from the temple before its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar
and its future return to the temple of Ezekiel's vision is
most interesting. It is the same glory which departed,[302]
which returns; it is the same Lord who resumes relationship
with His earthly people. The withdrawal of the visible
glory of the Lord meant the departure of His gracious
presence from among His people, which was followed by
judgment. The return of the visible glory means the return
of His gracious presence among them and that the judgment,
which has lasted so long, is forever gone. The departure
of the glory was through the east gate and was
finally seen upon the mountain at the east side of the city;
the return is from the way of the east and the glory of the
Lord enters through the east gate. But it is not only a
visible glory, but the Lord Himself is in the Shekinah.
Ezekiel beheld above the firmament and the cherubim,
when he saw the glory of the Lord at the river Chebar, he
heard His voice. And here also His voice is mentioned
"like the sound of many waters." From verses 6 and 7
we learn that after the glory had entered the house the
Lord addressed the prophet out of the house.

The Lord Himself in all His glory is manifested and enters
the temple, the place of His rest and glory. The cherubim
will be seen in person and from the New Testament we learn
that angels will be with Him also. His glory will then cover
Israel's land and the earth. "His glory covered the heavens,
and the earth was full of His praise. And His brightness was
as the light; He had bright beams out of His side[45] and there
was the hiding of His power." This is how Habakkuk
describes the same manifestation of the glory of the Lord
and the coming of the Lord of glory (see Isaiah xl:5; lviii:8;
lx:1-2; lxvi:18). Isaiah's great vision may be viewed
as foreshadowing this manifestation of His glory. He saw the
Lord sitting upon a throne and His train filled the temple.
The seraphim cried one unto another, and said, Holy, holy,[303]
holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His
glory. And as the prophet was cleansed and his iniquity
taken away and became the messenger of the Lord (Is. vi),
so the nation Israel will be cleansed and forgiven and become
the messenger of Jehovah.[46]

When the Spirit had transported the prophet into the
inner court of the temple, he discovered that the glory
of the Lord filled the house. We repeat it, no such thing
happened when the returned Jewish remnant had entered
the temple. When the old men, who had seen the Solomonic
temple and knew of its glory, beheld the foundation of the
second temple they wept (Ezra iii:12). When the house
was dedicated no glory returned, no cloud was seen, no shekinah
filled the house. Nor is it a spiritual glory, the glory
of the church, as so many seem to believe.

But Haggai, who with Zechariah prophesied during the rebuilding
of the temple, uttered a significant prophecy while
that second house was building&mdash;a prophecy which must
be linked with Ezekiel's vision of the returning glory: "For
thus saith the Lord of Hosts: yet once it is a little while,
and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea,
and the dry land. And I will shake all nations, and the
Desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with
glory" (Haggai ii:6-7). This was not the house they were
building. It is a future house, a future temple. That
house will be built when the heavens and the earth are
being shaken, when all nations shake and when the Desire
of all nations, the King of glory, the Prince of Peace, our
Lord comes. Then this house will be filled with glory.

It will be a visible glory. It will be a permanent glory.
He will now dwell gloriously in the midst of the children of
Israel (verse 7). This visible glory will be seen over Jerusalem,[304]
like as it was of old, a cloud by day and a shining,
flaming fire by night. "And Jehovah will create over
every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and over its convocations
a cloud by day and a smoke and the brightness of a flame
of fire by night, for over all the glory shall be a covering"
(Is. iv:5).


II. The Voice from the Temple and the Message to Israel.

And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man
stood by me. And he said unto me, Son of man, this is the place of
my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell
in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name,
shall the house of Israel no more defile, they, nor their kings, with
their fornication, and with the carcases of their kings in their high
places. In that they set their threshold by my threshold, and their
post by my post, and there was only a wall between me and them,
they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that
they have committed: and I consumed them in mine anger. Now
let them put away their fornication and the carcases of their kings,
far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. Thou
son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be
ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.
And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the
form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and its goings out, and
its comings in, and all its forms, and all the ordinances, and all the
forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight,
that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances
thereof, and do them. This is the law of the house; Upon the
top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be
most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house (verses 6-12).

The Glory of the Lord and the Lord of Glory had entered
the house, filling it; and now the voice of one is heard
out of the house. The speaker is the Lord Himself, who had
made His dwelling place in the temple (see also xlvi:20, 24;
xlvii:6, 8). The man who stood by Ezekiel did not speak,
as some expositors claim. He is only guide to the prophet
(xliv:1, 4; xlvi:19, 21). He is probably not the same person,[305]
who as the measuring man had accompanied the prophet,
for the Hebrew is not "the man" "stood by me," but "a
man." This person, no doubt an angel, is silent, waiting
till the Lord has spoken and then leads the prophet from
place to place.

The first word which the Lord addressed to Ezekiel
from the house is significant: "Son of Man, this is the place
of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet where
I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever."
Of old the Lord dwelt in the midst of the children of Israel.
Thus we read in the book of Exodus, the book of redemption:
"I will dwell among the children of Israel, and I will
be their God, and they shall know that I am Jehovah
their God that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt
that I may dwell among them" (Ex. xxix:45, 46). And now
after the long and sad history of Israel's apostasy, blindness,
judgment and dispersion is ended, He comes to make His
dwelling place in their midst again and establishes in Jerusalem
His throne. Here He will dwell and bless His people.
Of this Psalm cxxxii speaks, "This is my rest forever, here
will I dwell, for I have desired it." And other prophets
announced that the Lord would dwell in Zion in the midst
of His people and establish His throne there (Joel iii:17, 21;
Zech. ii:10, 11; viii:3, 8). His rest then will be glorious
(Is. xi:10). When that time comes and the Lord of Glory
has come back to earth again, all the promised blessings for
Israel, the nations and for all creation will be realized.

Then His holy name will no longer be defiled and the
nation will be ashamed of all their past history of rebellion
and abomination.[47] The prophet is therefore commanded[306]
to set before the people the house in its measured pattern,
so that they might know what a gracious Lord has prepared
for them, what He will yet do for His people. It is to lead
them to repentance, to acknowledgement of their guilt
and shame over their iniquities. Such will be the case
in the day of their restoration when these things will be
accomplished.

When this house on the top of the mountain is established
all will be most holy. His people will be righteous and holy
and all Jerusalem with this sanctuary will be holy unto the
Lord (Zech. xiv:20-21). This is "the Most Holy" of Daniel's
prophecy (Dan. ix) to be anointed when the last prophetic
week of seven years has expired.


III. The Measurement and the Ordinances of the Altar.

And these are the measures of the altar in cubits: The cubit is a
cubit and an hand breadth: The bottom was a cubit, and the
breadth a cubit, and its border thereof on the edge thereof round
about shall be a span: and this was the base of the altar. And from
the bottom upon the ground to the lower settle was two cubits,
and the breadth a cubit; and from the small settle to the great
settle four cubits, and the breadth a cubit. So the altar was four
cubits; and from the hearth of God and upward were four horns.
And the hearth of God was twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square
in the four sides thereof. And the settle was fourteen cubits long
and fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about
it half a cubit; and the bottom thereof a cubit about; and its steps
shall look toward the east. And he said unto me, Son of man, thus
saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar
in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon,
and to sprinkle blood thereon. And thou shalt give to the priests
the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me,
to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a
sin offering. And thou shalt take of its blood, and put it on the
four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon
the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.
Thou shalt take the bullock of the sin offering, and it shall be burned
in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. And on[307]
the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for
a sin offering; and they shall purge the altar, as they did purge it
with the bullock. When thou hast made an end of purging it, thou
shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the
flock without blemish. And thou shalt offer them before Jehovah,
and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them
up for a burnt offering unto Jehovah. Seven days shalt thou
prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare
a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall
consecrate it. And when these days are expired, it shall be, that
upon the eighth day and so forward, the priests shall make your
burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I
will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah (verses 13-27).

The altar which is now described in its measurement,
was previously mentioned in chapter xl:47. The altar
according to this description, is composed of four square
layers (probably stones) one above another, decreasing in
extent and increasing in thickness; the top is a square of
twelve cubits. This is called "the altar hearth" or "the
hearth of God." The three words translated in the authorized
version by altar are not the same in the original.
In verse 13 the word is "mizbeach." This word is used many
times in the Hebrew Bible; it means "slaughter-place."
In verse 15 two words are used which are nowhere else
found in connection with an altar. The one is "Harel"
which means "the mountain of God;" and the other "Ariel"
the meaning of this is different from Ariel in Isa. xxix:1[48]
when it is used for Jerusalem as "the lion of God." Gesenius
translated it "the hearth," and still better is "the hearth
of God." Upward from this hearth were four horns. The
Septuagint gives the height of these horns as one cubit
each. While in Exodus xx:25 steps are prohibited for the[308]
altar, this altar has steps which look toward the east. This
great burnt offering altar, standing in the center of the inner
court before the house, will be the central place of worship
in this future temple.

The ordinances of this burnt offering altar in that future
day are given to the prophet, the Lord Jehovah addressing
Ezekiel as "Son of Man." Burnt offerings will be brought
upon it and blood sprinkled. The priests, the Levites of
the seed of Zadok[49] will minister unto the Lord Jehovah.
What is first described is a kind of consecration or dedication
of this burnt offering altar, after which the general sacrifices
begin (verse 27). First a young bullock is brought for a
sin offering and the blood is applied to the altar and the
four horns. For seven days these offerings for purging and
cleansing continue and with the eighth day the burnt
offerings and peace offerings are to be made by the people.

But what do these ordinances mean? Here are priests
again standing before an altar, bringing bloody sacrifices,
burnt offerings, sin offerings and peace offerings. Is this to
be taken literally also? Some expositors have stated
that all this had a meaning in the past and could only be
true in connection with the second temple. Others attempt
to read into it a spiritual meaning. All, or nearly all commentators
think it inconceivable that such sacrifices could
ever be brought again in a future temple. Those expositors
who combat the premillennial coming of the Lord and the
literal restoration of Israel, consider the supposed impossibility
of a satisfactory explanation of this part of Ezekiel's
visions, the collapse of the premillennial argument.

Sacrifices of bulls and goats were brought by Israel in their
past history; the Lord commanded His people to do this.[309]
Every Christian knows that these sacrifices foreshadowed
the work of Christ, His great sacrifice on the Cross. In
themselves these sacrifices Israel brought could not take
away sins, nor give rest to the conscience, nor could they
make the worshipper perfect. The Epistle to the Hebrews
demonstrates this fully.

All these sacrifices had a prospective character, looking
forward to the work of the Cross. And when the Lamb
of God died, when His blessed lips uttered the never-to-be-forgotten
words, "It is finished," and God's hand rent the veil
from top to bottom, the prospective character of these
sacrifices were forever ended. The new and living way into
God's presence, into the Holiest, had been made by His
blood. During this age Israel has no temple and all their
Levitical ordinances can no longer be practised by them.
As Hosea declared they are without a sacrifice (Hos. iii:4).

God, during this age, our present age, which began with
the rejection of Christ by Israel and ends with His Return,
is gathering a heavenly people, the church. The church
has for its worship no earthly place, no temple, but worships
in spirit and in truth, in a heavenly sanctuary. There are
no sacrifices, priests, altars, in connection with the true
church, the body of Christ. Christ is all. He is the sacrifice,
the priest, and the altar. That the enemy has produced
upon Christian ground a ritualism which is aped
after the Jewish system and which denies as such the Gospel
and Christianity, is well known. They have invented altars,
and sacrifices and priests. This is the Judaizing of the
church, "the other Gospel which is not another," upon
which the Spirit of God has pronounced the curse of God
(Gal. i). The day is coming when the Lord will deal in
judgment with the apostate church which denies His Son
and His work, while His true church will be taken to the
place which He has prepared.

[310]When the true church is no longer on earth and the apostate
church is left behind to plunge into the great apostasy,
then the Jews will partially be restored in unbelief. When
they get back to the land they will put up another temple
in which they bring again bloody sacrifices. These will be
an abomination in the sight of God. Let us hear what
Isaiah reveals about this time: "Thus saith the Lord, the
heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool: where
is the house that ye will build unto me? and where is the
place of my rest? For all those things hath mine hand made
and all those things have been, saith the Lord. But to
this man will I look, that is poor and of a contrite spirit,
and trembleth at my word. He that killeth an ox is as if
he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off
a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered
swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed
an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their
soul delighteth in their abomination" (Isaiah lxvi:1-3).
The entire last chapter of Isaiah shows that the future is
in view. The Jews have returned to their land and have
resumed their ancient worship. In their midst is also a
believing remnant (verse 5) who suffer and are cast out.
The Lord looking down from heaven and beholding the
sacrifices they bring despises them, for they are an abomination
in His sight, because they reject Christ and His sacrifice.
This temple worship will be made possible by the
coming prince, the little horn of Daniel vii, who will make
a covenant with the unbelieving portion of the nation.
In the middle of the last seven years (Dan. ix:26) he will
break that covenant. Then appears the beast out of the
earth (Rev. xiii:11), the false Messiah, and takes his place
in that temple, demanding divine worship, claiming to
be God (2 Thess. ii).

At the end of the three and one-half years which constitute[311]
the great tribulation, the Lord is suddenly manifested.
Of this Isaiah speaks also. The unbelieving Jews sneer
at the believing remnant: "Let the Lord be glorified!"
The Spirit of God gives them the assurance, "but He
shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed." "A
voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a
voice of the Lord that rendereth recompense to His enemies"
(verse 6). These words describe His manifestation. After
this comes the restoration of Israel. The apostates who
worshipped the Beast will be punished. The temple Ezekiel
describes will then be built and Israel is now at last the
kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Exod. xix:6). The
new covenant promised to them will then be ratified (Jere.
xxxi:31-34).

Their great temple will be more than their place of worship;
it will be a house of prayer for all nations. Let us
listen again to Isaiah's great testimony. "The sons of the
stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve Him,
and to love the name of the Lord, to be His servants,
every one that keepeth the Sabbath[50] from polluting it, and
taketh hold of my covenant; even them (Gentiles) will
I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my
house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices
shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall
be called an house of prayer for all people. The Lord
God who gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will
I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered
unto Him" (Is. lvi:6-8). All this has nothing to do with
the church or the present dispensation of grace. It is a
prophecy of the kingdom, the age to come, the dispensation
of the fullness of times.
[312]
So let us understand that the millennial temple will be the
great center of earthly worship during the reign of the
King of Kings. In that temple sacrifices will be brought
again. The ancient worship of Israel will be resumed and
that in a way as Israel never enjoyed it in the past. To
deny the literalness of these sacrifices does violence to the
Word of God. Ezekiel is not the only prophet who tells
us of this. One of the strongest passages is found in Jeremiah.
Speaking of the coming reign of Christ, Jeremiah
tells us, "In those days shall Judah be saved and Jerusalem
shall dwell safely, and this is the name wherewith she shall
be called, The Lord our Righteousness. For thus saith
the Lord, David shall never want a man to sit upon the
throne of the house of Israel. Neither shall the priests,
the Levites want a man before Me to offer burnt offerings,
and to kindle meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually"
(Jere. xxxiii:15-18). Why then should it be an impossible
thing that literal sacrifices are brought again?

But what is the meaning and the purpose of these animal
sacrifices? The answer is quite simple. While the sacrifices
Israel brought once had a prospective meaning, the
sacrifices brought in the millennial temple have a retrospective
meaning. When during this age God's people
worship in the appointed way at His table, with the bread
and wine as the memorial of His love, it is a retrospect.
We look back to the Cross. We show forth His death.
It is "till He comes." Then this memorial feast ends
forever. Never again will the Lord's Supper be kept after
the Saints of God have left the earth to be with the Lord
in glory. The resumed sacrifices will be the memorial of
the Cross and the whole wonderful story of the redemption
for Israel and the nations of the earth, during the kingdom
reign of Christ. And what a memorial it will be! What a
meaning these sacrifices will have! They will bring to a[313]
living remembrance everything of the past. The retrospect
will produce the greatest scene of worship, of praise and
adoration this earth has ever seen. All the Cross meant
and the Cross has accomplished will be recalled and a
mighty "Hallelujah Chorus" will fill the earth and the
heavens. The sacrifices will constantly remind the peoples
of the earth of Him who died for Israel, who paid the redemption
price for all creation and whose glory now covers
the earth as the waters cover the deep. And above in the
New Jerusalem, where the throne of the Lamb is, the Saints
in glory sing their Hallelujah (Ps. cxlix:5).


I. The Outer Eastern Gate and the Prince.

Chapter xliv.

Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut. Then
said the Lord unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be
opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord, the God
of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. It is for
the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord;
he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go
out by the way of the same (verses 1-3).

In the previous chapter the prophet was in the inner court
(xliii:5). It was there he heard the voice of the Lord and
received the message and saw the great altar and its ordinances.
From the inner court he is led back by the man
to the eastern gate. This gate he finds no longer open.
As they arrived it was shut. The last time that gate was
seen it was open, and the glory of the Lord entered through
this eastern gateway. The reason why this gate is to be
shut is stated by the Lord in His address to Ezekiel. "Then
said the Lord unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be
opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord,
the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore shall it
be shut." The Lord who entered with His glory is the Son[314]
of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and here His full glory is
made known. He is the Lord, the God of Israel, He "whose
goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting" (Micah
v:2). The gate is now to serve another purpose. "It is
for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before
the Lord; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that
gate, and shall go out by the way of the same." Who is
this prince? Some say that this prince is the Lord Himself.
Our Lord is repeatedly called a prince (Isaiah ix:6, 7,
lv:4[51]; Dan. ix:25; Rev. i:5). In chapters xxxiv and xxxvii
Messiah, Christ, is meant by the One Shepherd "My servant
David," who will be King and Prince over them. But now
in the closing chapters of this book a prince is mentioned
seventeen times. But not once is he spoken of as "David"
or "my servant David." This prince is not the Messiah,
our Lord; nor is he the high priest as others claim. The
best evidence that this prince is not Christ is learned from
the ordinances he is to observe as revealed in chapter xlvi,
where we read that he is to worship himself and that he
must bring burnt offerings and peace offerings; we also read
of this prince having sons. All this shows that the prince
is not identical with the Lord. Who is he then? He is
the viceregent of the King, a future prince of the house of
David, who will represent the Lord on earth. David's
throne will be established in Jerusalem. The Lord Jesus
Christ will reign supreme over all; His throne is above the
earth in the New Jerusalem. He will visit the earth and
manifest His glory as King of kings and Lord of lords. This
probably will be during the great celebrations of the feast of
Tabernacles, when the nations send their representatives
to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of Hosts (Zech.
xiv:16). Upon David's throne will sit this prince of David
[315]
as viceregent. The enemy anticipating this has counterfeited
this vice-regency in the spurious claims of the Roman
pope.

This prince as the vice-regent, has to enter by the way
of the porch of the eastern gateway, and he must also go
out the same way (see also xlvi:2-8.)


II. Concerning the Strangers and the Levites in Relation
to the Temple Worship.

Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house
and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of
the Lord; and I fell upon my face. And the Lord said unto me,
Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with
thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of
the house of the Lord, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the
entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.
And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel,
Thus saith the Lord God; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of
all your abominations. In that ye have brought into my sanctuary
strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in
flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when
ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my
covenant because of all your abominations. And ye have not
kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of
my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

Thus saith the Lord God; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart,
nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any
stranger that is among the children of Israel. And the Levites that
are gone away from me, when Israel went astray, which went
astray away from me after their idols: they shall even bear their
iniquity. Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having
charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house:
they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people,
and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. Because
they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the
house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine
hand against them, saith the Lord God, and they shall bear their
iniquity. And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office
of a priest unto me, not to come near to any of my holy things, in[316]
the most holy place; but they shall bear their shame, and their
abominations which they have committed. But I will make
them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof,
and for all that shall be done therein. (verses 4-14).

Brought again through the north gate of the inner court,
the prophet is face to face with the glory of the Lord which
filled the house of the Lord, and Ezekiel fell on his face.
Then the Lord addressed him. He is to mark well what
he sees and what he hears concerning the ordinances and
the laws of the house of the Lord. The temple is now
repeatedly called the house of the Lord, the place where
His glory dwells, exalted above the hills, to which the nations
shall come (Isaiah ii:2). Israel in this message is reminded
of the past. They were a rebellious house. This was the
burden of the opening messages of the prophet (chapter
ii, etc.). But now all must be and will be different. The
abominations of the past, the pollution of His house and all
else will now be put away. "Let it suffice you of all your
abominations." They will no longer be tolerated, nor will
converted Israel backslide again. He reminds them of
their sinful past and of the demands of holiness for His
house; all abominations and failures will cease. Uncircumcised
in heart and in flesh shall not enter into the sanctuary
of the Lord. Zechariah bears the same testimony: "In
that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house
of the Lord of hosts" (Zech. xiv:21). His people will then
be holy; their new birth has taken place, the uncircumcised,
stony heart is taken away and His Spirit is poured out upon
them (chapter xxxvi:25-27).

Verses 10-14 concern the Levites; they are to bear their
iniquity and be degraded as to their office. What Levites
are meant, and when did they go away from the Lord? It
cannot mean past generations of Levites. The offence
must have been committed by them before the Lord appeared[317]
in glory. It must be explained by what happened among
the people before the Lord came, during the days of the
false Messiah. At that time Israel will go far astray from
the Lord and turn again to idols. In this apostasy the
Levites have a share. "They ministered unto them before
their idols and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity."
When the Lord comes, when their sins are forgiven and they
are cleansed, the Lord will deal accordingly with these
Levites as announced in these verses. They shall bear
their iniquity for their unfaithfulness. "They shall not
come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor
to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy; but
they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which
they have committed." Yet there will be service for them.
"But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house,
for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done
therein."


III. Concerning the Priests, the sons of Zadok, and their
Duties.

But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the
charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray
from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and
they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood,
saith the Lord God: They shall enter into my sanctuary, and
they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they
shall keep my charge.

And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates
of the inner court, and they shall be clothed with linen garments;
and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the
gates of the inner court, and within. They shall have linen
bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their
loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causeth
sweat. And when they go forth into the outer court, even into
the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments
wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and
they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the[318]
people with their garments. Neither shall they shave their heads,
nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.
Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner
court. Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her
that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the
house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before. And they
shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane,
and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. And
in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge
it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and
my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my
sabbaths. And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves;
but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter,
for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may
defile themselves. And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon
unto him seven days. And in the day that he goeth into the
sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary,
he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord God. And it shall be
unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and ye shall
give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession. They
shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass
offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs. And
the first of all the first fruits of all things and every oblation of all
of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priests': ye shall also
give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause
the blessing to rest in thine house. The priests shall not eat
of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl
or beast (verses 15-31).

The sons of Zadok kept the charge, they were faithful
when the children of Israel went astray, and the Lord is now
announcing the reward for their faithfulness. The earthly
priesthood as it was once is re-established and vested in the
sons of Zadok. These are to come near unto Jehovah and
offer in His presence. How they are to come in, the garments
they shall wear, is made known to the prophet. They
are not to shave their heads, "neither shall any priest drink
wine, when they enter into the inner court." They are
forbidden to take for wives a widow or one that has been[319]
put away. Maidens of Israel or a priest's widow they could
marry. All this will be literally fulfilled and done when this
new and true worship is instituted in the coming age. It
has nothing whatever to do with our age. No such special
class of an earthly priesthood exists during this age of grace.
All believers constitute a holy and a royal priesthood; the
priests of ritualistic Christendom are an invention. But
when the Lord has restored Israel to their land and this
great place of worship stands, priestly ministrations will be
resumed. Neither will this be a denial of Him who is priest
forever after the order of Melchizedec. While the spurious,
man-made priesthood of this Christian age denies the Lord
and His finished work, the future priesthood ministering
in the millennial temple will glorify Him.

These priests will also be teachers and exercise judicial
authority (verses 23-24). The law of defilement will
be enforced, though there will be less possibility of such
defilement, for death during the millennium will not be the
rule as it is now, but a rare and exceptional occurrence.
Finally we read of the inheritance of the priests who minister
before the Lord. "I am their inheritance, and ye shall
give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession."
While many of these appointments in priestly ministry
during the millennium are obscure to us who enjoy the
heavenly things, we may rest assured that the Lord in His
own time "in that day" will bring about the accomplishment
of all He has spoken.


Chapter xlv.

I. The Holy Portion of the Land for the Sanctuary, the
Priests, the Levites, the City and the Prince.

Moreover when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,
ye shall offer an oblation unto the Lord, an holy portion of the
land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand
reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy[320]
in all the borders thereof round about. Of this there shall be for the
sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth,
square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs
thereof. And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of
five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand;
and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place. The
holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the
sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the Lord: and
it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the
sanctuary. And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the
ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of
the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.

And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation
of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.

And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the
other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession
of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the
possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the
east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the
portions, from the west border unto the east border. In the land
shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more
oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the
house of Israel according to their tribes (verses 1-8).

The land possessed will be divided by lot for the inheritance
of the people. The special territorial division for the different
tribes is recorded in the last two chapters. They are to bring
an oblation of the land which the Lord so graciously restored
unto them. The word "oblation" is literally an "heave-offering,"
because when anything was offered to Jehovah
the offerer raised the hand. The dimensions of the holy
portion of the land are, in length 25,000, and in breadth
10,000. But what? The Hebrew has no definite measure.
The authorized version supplies the word "reeds," which
seems to be correct in view of the statement in chapter
xlii:16.[52] This is a very large territory, a square of some[321]
sixty miles on each side. The topography of Palestine will
be entirely changed in the coming age, as we pointed out
before. The land is to be greatly enlarged, while the temple-mountain
will be highly exalted. These changes will make
all possible which we read in these closing chapters. We
must take these chapters in faith, knowing that the omnipotent
Lord will accomplish all in his own time. In the center
of this large area, the holy portion of the Lord, will be the
sanctuary; the measurement is given in verse 2. Around
this the priests have their portion; there they will have their
houses. The estate of the Levites comes next; the measurement
is given, and that they shall have for possession
twenty chambers. The Septuagint has "cities to dwell in,"
habitations where they will reside. This is undoubtedly
the correct meaning. Then the measurement of the city is
given, which is for the whole house of Israel. Finally the
portion of the Prince is recorded. "And the Prince shall
have his portion on the one side and on the other side of the
holy oblation, and of the possession of the city over against
the holy oblation, and over against the possession of the
city, from the west side westward, and from the east side
eastward; and in length answering to one of the portions
of the tribes from the west border unto the east border."
From this we learn that the estate of the Prince consists of
two halves, the one on the west and the other on the east
of the holy portion. He stands as the head and ruler in
closest connection with the sanctuary. It is all a new
order and will be brought about when the Lord has come
back, and when Israel is restored to the land. They never
possessed such a holy portion in the land, nor such a sanctuary.
A spiritual application as to the Church is impossible
to make; the literal interpretation is the only possible
one which can be made.[322]


III. Exhortation Addressed to the Princes.

Thus saith the Lord God; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel:
remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take
away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord God. Ye
shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. The
ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may
contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part
of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer. And the
shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty
shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh[53] (verses 9-12).

The princes who used to oppress the people, shall no longer
oppress (verse 8). They are to execute judgment and justice.
Every measure is to be just. The time has come when
righteousness reigns. "He shall judge the poor of the people,
he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in
pieces the oppressor" (Ps. lxxii:4). No longer will the poor
be down-trodden.


IV. The Oblation for the Prince and His Offerings.

This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah
of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah
of an homer of barley: Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath
of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is
an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer: And one lamb
out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel;
for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings,
to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord God. All the
people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.
And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and
meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the
new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the
house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat
offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make
reconciliation for the house of Israel (verses 13-17).

What the ruling Prince, the vice-regent upon the throne[323]
of David, is to receive from the people is stated in verses
13-16. The part of the Prince is to give burnt-offerings,
meal offerings, drink offerings, at the different feasts and
solemnities, to make reconciliation for the House of Israel.
No doubt all this has a retrospective value and meaning.
These sacrifices and offerings commemorate the one great
sacrifice, which is constantly and vividly kept in full view
by these ceremonies.


V. The Two Great Feasts Passover and the Feast
of Tabernacles.

Thus saith the Lord God; In the first month, in the first day of
the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and
cleanse the sanctuary: And the priest shall take of the blood of
the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon
the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the
gate of the inner court. And so thou shalt do the seventh day
of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple:
so shall ye reconcile the house. In the first month, in the fourteenth
day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven
days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. And upon that day shall
the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a
bullock for a sin offering. And seven days of the feast he shall
prepare a burnt offering to the Lord, seven bullocks and seven rams
without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily
for a sin offering. And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah
for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.
In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do
the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering,
according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering,
and according to the oil (verses 18-25).

First stands the cleansing of the sanctuary on the first day
of the first month. The cleansing of the sanctuary therefore
commences the year. And this offering of a young bullock
without blemish shows forth Christ in His wonderful,
unblemished devotedness as He suffered once for sin. The
same sacrifice will be repeated on the seventh day, and it is[324]
then especially for everyone that erreth and for him that is
simple. The precious blood of the Lamb of God is thus
constantly kept in remembrance. Two great feasts will be
celebrated, the Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles.
These are the feasts of the Millennium. Very significantly
the feast of weeks, that is Pentecost, is no longer mentioned.
Dispensationally the Feast of Pentecost typifies the coming
of the Spirit of God, to baptize believing Jews and Gentiles
into one body. Pentecost ushered in this present age,
and during its course the Holy Spirit is on earth fulfilling
His mission in calling from Jews and Gentiles a people for
His name. When this age closes with the great predicted
events transpiring, the Spirit of God has finished the work
for which He came. The body of Christ is taken home to
glory and united with the Head. It is true the Holy Spirit
will yet be poured out upon all flesh (Joel ii:28) but the dispensational
aspect of Pentecost is fulfilled and can have no
such meaning in millennial times.[54]

And how appropriate it is that only Passover and the
Feast of Tabernacles are celebrated by Israel when the Lord
has come. Passover was first kept in Egypt; its precious
meaning is well known to all Christians. Redemption by
blood, so fully realized in the work of the spotless Lamb
of God, is blessedly seen in the Passover, while the Feast
of Unleavened Bread reveals the purpose of redemption&mdash;redemption
unto holiness. Israel observed this feast in
the wilderness. They celebrated it when they had come into
the land; then under Hezekiah and Josiah it was recovered.
During their long dispersion Israel has not forgotten this[325]
feast. Though with judicial blindness upon them, eyes that
cannot see and ears that cannot hear, the people keep once
a year the Passover. Longingly the orthodox Jew looks
towards the land of promise and repeats each Passover
night the pious wish "This day here; next year in Jerusalem."
When the nation is regathered and the Kingdom is established
in their midst, they will keep this Feast anew. What
meaning it will then have! What memories cluster around
it! How all their history will be recalled by that Feast&mdash;started
in Egypt and consummated in the Kingdom! But
the observance apart from the unleavened bread is different.
The Prince and all the people on the fourteenth day of the
first month are identified as they never were before, in a
single bullock for a sin offering, while every day for seven
days the Prince prepares a complete burnt offering, a sign
of perfect consecration to the Lord. What praise the Lord,
the Lamb of God enthroned in glory, and His glory covering
the earth, will receive in these yearly memorial feasts.

The Feast of Tabernacles is the second great feast. It
was kept by Israel when the harvest and the vintage had
taken place. It foreshadows the Millennium, when the
harvest and the vintage (Rev. xiv) the end of the age is
passed and the new age, the age of glory, has come; the
great ingathering has taken place and the prophetic meaning
of the Feast of Tabernacles will be realized. Zechariah
xiv:16-21 tells us of its Millennial celebration.


Chapter xlvi.

I. The Worship of the Prince.

Thus saith the Lord God; The gate of the inner court that
looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but
on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon
it shall be opened. And the prince shall enter by the way of the
porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate,
and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings,[326]
and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall
go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. Likewise
the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate
before the Lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons. And the
burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord in the
sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without
blemish. And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram,
and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and
an hin of oil to an ephah. And in the day of the new moon it shall
be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram:
they shall be without blemish. And he shall prepare a meat
offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for
the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil
to an ephah. And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the
way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way
thereof (verses 1-8).

Here another worship scene of the Millennium is described.
The prominent eastern gate is to be closed during the six
working days, but on the Sabbath it shall be opened, as well
as in the day of the new moon. The Sabbath and the new
moon are prominent in the worship of the Kingdom
Age. The Sabbath was a type of the coming rest
for the people of Israel.[55] This rest has now come.
Their wanderings are ended, they are gathered from
the East and from the West, from the North and South,
and have found at last the promised rest (Ps. cvii:1-8).
Therefore the Sabbath is especially mentioned in connection
with worship. On the seventh day the gate through which
the Lord and His glory passed is opened and left open till
the evening. The six working days (typical of 6,000 years)
are forever gone, the seventh day, the seventh thousand,
the Day of the Lord, has come. And when the Millennium
ends, the complete, eternal rest comes for all the people of
God. The new moon is typical of Israel's re-establishment[327]
as a nation. The nation, like the moon, had waned, and disappeared,
but now she shines again like the new moon.

The Prince is to worship at the threshold of the gate, and
the people before the gate. But neither the Prince nor the
people enter within. No drawing near to God is known
then as we now enjoy it who worship in the Spirit through the
rent veil. It is all an earthly worship, while the true worship
of the Church is heavenly. The Prince in this worship enters
by the outer door on the side of the east and he goes out
by the same door. The Prince occupies the prominent place
as the representative of the people. He presents his offerings
to Jehovah, while the people stand as worshippers at the
outer gate of the same entrance. The offerings the Prince
is to bring on the Sabbath are larger than those commanded
in the law. Both the burnt-offering and the meal offering
brought by him on the Sabbath are more abundant than those
offered under the old dispensation, an evidence of the higher
and more perfect worship of restored Israel. Different,
however, is it with the offering on the new moon. In
Numbers xxviii:11-15 we read:

And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt
offering unto the Lord; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven
lambs of the first year without spot; And three tenth deals of flour
for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two
tenth deals of flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil for one
ram; And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meal
offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour,
a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord. And their drink offerings
shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third part of an
hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is
the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the
year. And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the Lord
shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink
offering.

Such are the offerings according to the law, to be brought[328]
on the new moon. But in the millennial worship these
offerings are diminished. All this has a deeper meaning
which will be fully known and enjoyed when this worship
is carried out.


II. Further Instructions as to Worship.

But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord in the
solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to
worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that
entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way
of the north gate; he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby
he came in, but shall go forth over against it. And the prince
in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in;
and when they go forth, shall go forth. And in the feasts
and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an ephah
to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to
give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. Now when the prince shall prepare
a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily
unto the Lord, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward
the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace
offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth;
and after his going forth one shall shut the gate. Thou shalt daily
prepare a burnt offering unto the Lord of a lamb of the first year
without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning. And thou
shalt prepare a meal offering for it every morning, the sixth part
of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil to temper with the
fine flour, a meal offering continually by a perpetual ordinance
unto the Lord. Thus shall they prepare the lamb and the meal
offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.
(verses 9-15.)

Everything is divinely ordered. Here are first the special
instructions for the worship of the people of the land. When
they come before the Lord in the solemn feasts some will
enter in to worship by the north gate and leave by the south
gate, and others who enter by the south gate will leave by the
way of the north gate. None is permitted to leave by the gate
through which he entered. Perhaps this injunction is given
to avoid confusion among the multitudes who will come to[329]
worship in those coming days, when the Lord will be universally
acknowledged (Zech. xiv:9).

In the midst of these worshipping masses will be the
Prince (verse 10). What a blessed reminder of Him who is
the One in the midst! He was in the midst on Calvary;
He is in the midst of His people during this age; in Revelation
He is seen in the midst of the throne (Rev. v:6). The
Prince as the representative of the King of kings is therefore
in the midst of His redeemed earthly Israel. The burnt-offering
and the meal offering, so prominent in this coming
worship are constant memorials of His great devotion when
He offered Himself, and of His holy, spotless humanity
in which He suffered and glorified God.

Something else of deep interest is recorded here. The daily
burnt-offerings during the old dispensation consisted of a
lamb every morning and of a lamb every evening. Here no
evening lamb for a burnt-offering is mentioned, but the offerings
are to be brought only during the mornings. The
bright morning has come, the day dawn for His people,
so long in the night of suffering and dispersion. The night
is gone forever and therefore the evening, preceding the night,
is no longer mentioned and no provision is made for an
evening burnt-offering. The night is gone and Israel's
glorious morning can never be darkened again by apostasy.


III. Concerning the Prince, His Sons and Servants.

Thus saith the Lord God; If the prince give a gift unto any of
his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their
possession by inheritance. But if he give a gift of his inheritance
to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty;
after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his
sons' for them. Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's
inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession;
but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession:
that my people be not scattered every man from his possession
(verses 16-18).[330]
Here we read that the Prince has sons, natural descendants,
and whatever gifts he bestows upon them shall be their
possession by inheritance. This is conclusive that the Prince
of these last chapters of Ezekiel is not Christ. The Prince
has sons and servants. As the entire final vision of this
book deals with the earthly conditions of the coming age,
and reveals nothing of the heavenly side of things, these sons
and servants cannot mean the church-saints, who are with
Christ in the New Jerusalem. As to a gift to one of the
Prince's servants, it is to revert to his sons when the year
of liberty or jubilee is celebrated. The jubilee year will
therefore be observed during the coming age.


IV. Additional Description of Temple Buildings.

After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of
the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward
the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.
Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests
shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall
bake the meal offering; that they bear them not out into the utter
court, to sanctify the people. Then he brought me forth into the
utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court;
and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. In the
four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits
long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.
And there was a row of buildings round about them, round about them
four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round
about. Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that
boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the
people (verses 19-24).

Again the prophet is brought by the northern gate to
the side where the holy chambers of the priests are located.
There he saw a place on the two sides westward. The use
of this place is made known in verse 20. The final description
of buildings round about the court needs no further comment.[331]


THE VISION CONCERNING THE LAND.

Chapter xlvii.

The preceding chapters of this final section of the Book of
Ezekiel contain the vision of the Temple and its worship.
The last two chapters give a vision of Israel's land as it will
be during the coming age.


I. The Temple Stream and its Healing Waters.

Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house;
and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house
eastward: for the forefront of the house was the east, and the
waters came down from under from the right side of the house,
from the south of the altar. Then brought he me out by the
way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto
the outer gate toward the gate that looketh eastward; and, behold,
there ran out waters on the right side. And when the man went
forth eastward, he had a line in his hand, and he measured a thousand
cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters
were to the ankles. Again he measured a thousand, and brought
me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he
measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were
to the loins. Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river
that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to
swim in, a river that could not be passed over.

And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he
brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.
Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were
very many trees on the one side and on the other. Then said he
unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go
down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth
into the sea, the waters shall be healed. And it shall come to pass,
that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers
shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of
fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be
healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh. And
it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from
En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth
nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the
great sea, exceeding many. But the marshes thereof and the pools[332]
thereof shall not be healed: they shall be given to salt. And by the
river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow
all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit
thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his
months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary:
and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for
medicine (verses 1-12).

This great vision of the Temple stream has been variously
interpreted. The critical school has treated it only as an
imagery of the prophet and speaks of the physical impossibility
that such a stream could ever be in existence.[56]
Others have spiritualized the vision. A leading annotator
states, "Messiah is the temple and the door; from His
pierced side flow the living waters, ever increasing, both
in the individual believer and in the heart." In this spiritualizing
method the waters are also applied to the reading
and study of the Word of God. The same commentator
says "some things in the Bible are easy to understand, as
the water up to the ankles; others more difficult, which
require deeper search, as the waters up to the knees and the
loins; and others beyond our reach." Such applications
can be made in different ways. The stream which Ezekiel
saw is more than typical of the blessings which the land and
all the earth will enjoy in the coming age. It is a literal
stream. There will be a great outpouring of the Spirit
of God for the age to come, and spiritual blessings will
abound everywhere. But the stream Ezekiel beholds tells
of the physical blessings which are in store for the earth
in that coming day of the restoration of all things. We do
not need to trouble ourselves about the manner in which the[333]
temple stream is to flow forth, nor do we need to solve the
physical difficulties. When the Lord of Creation was on
earth in humiliation, and walked among men garbed in
servant's form, nature acknowledged Him and He manifested
the Creator's power. What will it be when He comes
again, not as a servant to die, but as the King and Lord of
all! Omnipotence will then be displayed to the full. Is there
anything too hard for the Lord? (Jere. xxxii:27). He who
bore the thorns on His brow, the symbol of the curse which
on account of man's sin rests upon Creation, will remove
that curse in the day of His power. He paid for it on the
cross.

And Ezekiel was not the only prophet to whom was
revealed the physical blessing of the earth in the life and
health giving stream. Isaiah had the same vision. "And
the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty
land springs of water; in the habitation of jackals where
each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes" (Is. xxxv:7).
"I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the
desert" (Is. xliii:19). "Instead of the thorn shall come up
the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle
tree" (Is. lv:13). "The desert shall blossom like the rose"
(Is. xxxv:1). Joel at the close of his great vision concerning
the still future day of Israel's tribulation and the judgment
of the nations following the time of trouble, and the Lord's
visible manifestation, also speaks of the blessings of the
Millennium. "And it shall come to pass in that day, that
the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills
shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow
with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of
the Lord, and shall water the valley of Shittim" (Joel iii:18).
Joel, one of the earliest prophets, living centuries before
Ezekiel, saw water coming forth from the house of the
Lord for earthly blessings. Still more definite is the great[334]
post-exilic prophet Zechariah. "And it shall be in that day,
that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them
toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the hinder
sea; in summer and in winter shall it be" (Zech. xiv:8).

The waters Ezekiel saw issued out from under the threshold,
from the right side of the house, the south side of the
altar. Of the heavenly Jerusalem a similar scene is recorded
by John in the Revelation. "And he showed me a pure
river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the
throne of God and of the Lamb" (Rev. xxii:1). The stream
has its origin in the midst of the millennial temple. There is
no use in speculating about the source of the water supply.
It is super-natural. He who said, "Let there be a firmament
in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from
the waters" (Gen. i:6) and He who broke open all the
fountains of the deep when His judgment came on the
earth (Gen. vii:11) by whose power also the smitten rock
in the wilderness supplied the water for His people, He
will provide from His inexhaustible resources the life giving
stream. And the waters which gush forth are increasing
in volume; the stream does not become shallower but
deepens in its flow. It is not like a natural river which has
its source in a spring and is fed by brooks and rivers. It is
a miraculous, unexplainable self-supply which occasions this
increase. A thousand cubits are measured and the waters
come to the ankles of the prophet. The next thousand
cubits bring the waters to the knees; then advancing another
thousand cubits the waters come to the loins, and with
the fourth thousand they become so deep that the prophet
could not fathom them. The four thousand cubits make
about a mile and a half, so that the prophet had advanced,
under the guidance of the man, this distance from Jerusalem
in a southeastern direction.

He is caused to return to the bank of the river, and saw[335]
there on both sides many trees. These trees testify of the
great fertility which this stream will produce in nature.
Expositors who give the vision a purely spiritual meaning
explain the trees as being the righteous who shall flourish
at the waterbrooks (Psalm i).

The man informs the prophet that these waters go toward
the east country and go down into the desert. The word
desert in Hebrew is "Arabah" and means "plain," which is
the plain of Jordan. It signifies a parched, dry place.
Jordan is the type of death, and the sea of salt, the Dead
Sea, into which Jordan flows, also signifies death.[57] And now
in the Dead Sea this living water from the temple flows, and
healing is the blessed result. Where death has reigned so long
abundant life now is manifested. Sodom is restored to its
former estate (See chapter xvi). Wheresoever the waters
go life follows at once. "There shall be a very great multitude
of fish, because these waters shall come thither, for they shall
be healed; and everything shall live whither the river
cometh. The fishers shall stand up from En-gedi unto
En-eglaim." En-gedi is on the one end and En-eglaim at
the other end of the Dead Sea. Yet there will be marshes
and pools which remain unhealed; their former condition
is unchanged. It has been suggested that this is done for
the production of salt. But it is rather a reminder that while
the coming age is an age of wonderful blessing, that it is not
yet the perfect, eternal age. And the trees will be ever
green, never failing, providing meat by their abundant
fruit and the leaf is for medicine. It shows the gracious
provision made for man living on the earth during the age to
come. Poverty, famine and sickness will be banished.
[336]

II. The Borders of the Land.

Thus saith the Lord God; This shall be the border, whereby ye
shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel:
Joseph shall have two portions. And ye shall inherit it, one as
well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give
it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.
And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from
the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad: Hamath,
Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and
the border of Hamath; Hazar-hatticon, which is by the coast of
Hauran. And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the
border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of
Hamath. And this is the north side. And the east side ye shall
measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and
from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east
sea. And this is the east side. And the south side southward,
from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the
great sea. And this is the south side southward. The west side
also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come over
against Hamath. This is the west side. So shall ye divide this
land unto you according to the tribes of Israel (verses 13-21).

Little comment is needed on these verses. That the literal
land and the literal tribes are meant, no intelligent readers
can deny. The twelve tribes are then back in the land. The
so-called "lost tribes" are united with the house of Judah.
Here the borders are given. Joseph has two portions.
God is faithful. He has not forgotten His gracious promises
of old. "And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another,
concerning which I lifted up mine hand (in oath) to give it
unto your fathers; and this land shall fall unto your inheritance."
The whole land is to be divided according to
the tribes of Israel.


III. Concerning the Stranger in the Land.

And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an
inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you,
which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you[337]
as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall
have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. And it shall
come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall
ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord God (verses 22-23).

Here is a provision for the strangers. They are no longer
to be treated as outcasts, as aliens from the commonwealth
of Israel; they are seen fully identified with Israel and share
the inheritance. This again confirms other prophecies
(See Isaiah lx:1-10.) The strangers shall come and build
the walls, and join themselves to Israel. The singing times
for Israel have come. No longer will the chosen people be
the tail of nations, but the head of all nations. "Sing and
rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for, lo, I come, and I will dwell
in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. And many nations
shall be joined to the Lord in that day and shall be my
people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee."...
(Zech. ii:10-12). No longer will the Jew be despised, but
the strangers, the nations, will beseech him to take them to
the glory land. "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, In those days
it shall come to pass, that ten men out of all languages of the
nations shall take hold, even shall take hold of the skirt
of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we
have heard that God is with you" (Zech. viii:23).[339]



PLAN OF THE DIVISION OF THE LAND.


[341]


THE PORTION OF THE TRIBES; THE TERRITORY
OF THE OBLATION; THE CITY, ITS GATES AND
NEW NAME.

Chapter xlviii.


I. The portion of Seven Tribes.

Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to
the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazar-enan,
the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath;
for these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan. And by
the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a portion
for Asher. And by the border of Asher, from the east side even
unto the west side, a portion for Naphtali. And by the border of
Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for
Manasseh. And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto
the west side, a portion for Ephraim. And by the border of
Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion
for Reuben. And by the border of Reuben, from the east side
unto the west side, a portion for Judah.

And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west
side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty
thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other
parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary
shall be in the midst of it (verses 1-8).

The division of the land to the twelve tribes, then fully
restored, is by lot (xlvii:22) but the disposing of it will be
by the Lord (Prov. xvi:33). The order is entirely different
from the one found in the Book of Joshua (Josh. xv-xix).
Up to the time of the carrying away of the ten tribes and the
captivity of Judah, the tribes possessed the territory assigned
to them by lot when they entered the land under Joshua.
The ten tribes never returned from the captivity, and therefore
the division of the land as given here has never been in
the history of Israel. It is future. The division is in twelve
portions all alike in dimensions, running alongside of each
other, from west to east. Seven tribes are in the north,[342]
and five in the south. Between the seven tribes in the north
and the tribes in the south is the oblation, the heave offering,
the portion of the prince, the Levites and the priests, the
Temple and the city with its surrounding territory. The
tribe of Dan has its portion in the extreme north. It is the
furthest away from the sanctuary. Dan was a corrupt
tribe, semi-heathen (Judges xviii). Dan is not mentioned
among the sealed one in Revelation vii. All the other
tribes are placed in a different order from the former position.


II. The Oblation; the Remaining Tribes.

The oblation that ye shall offer unto the Lord shall be of five and
twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth. And
for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; toward
the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west
ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in
breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length:
and the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst thereof.
It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok;
which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the
children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. And
this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing
most holy by the border of the Levites. And over against the
border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty
thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length
shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits
of the land: for it is holy unto the Lord.

And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against
the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city,
for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst
thereof. And these shall be the measures thereof; the north
side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four
thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand
and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five
hundred. And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north
two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and
fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the
west two hundred and fifty. And the residue in length over against[343]
the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward,
and ten thousand westward: and it shall be over against the
oblation of the holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for
food unto them that serve the city. And they that serve the city
shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel. All the oblation shall
be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye
shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the
city.

And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the
other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over
against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the
east border, and westward over against the five and twenty
thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the
prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the
house shall be in the midst thereof. Moreover from the possession
of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the
midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah
and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince. As for the rest
of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin shall
have a portion. And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side
unto the west side, Simeon shall have a portion. And by the border
of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar a portion.
And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west
side, Zebulun a portion. And by the border of Zebulun, from
the east side unto the west side, Gad a portion. And by the border
of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from
Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward
the great sea. This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto
the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions,
saith the Lord God (verses 9-29).

Judah's portion on the north and Benjamin's portion on the
south border are an oblation, that which is offered unto the
Lord. In this space of large dimensions are the portions of the
Levites and the priests. The Temple stands in the middle of
the portion of the priests, and adjoining is the holy city
and its territory.[58] The Prince has his portion on both sides
of the oblation, the heave offering. That Judah and Benjamin[344]
are bordering on these holy sections is not without
meaning. Judah is the royal tribe. He who is now worshipped
by His restored people is the Lion of the tribe of
Judah, Israel's King. Judah means "praise". He receives
the praises of His people. Benjamin's other name was
Benoni, "the son of suffering" and Benjamin is "the son of
the right hand." Both Judah and Benjamin are a reminder
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

It is impossible to explain fully the measurements given
and other details of this chapter. We believe what God has
written, and when the time has come He will surely see to
it that all is done according to His word. We do not need
to trouble ourselves with supposed difficulties or try to
solve them. As stated before in this exposition, Israel's
land will undergo a wonderful change when the Lord comes;
these physical changes are unknown to us in their extent.
The division of the land, and the setting apart of the oblation
will then take place. The details in all these visions are of
little importance to us. The main fact is to see that all these
prophecies have remained unfulfilled up to now. Nor will
they be fulfilled during the present age. As every judgment
prediction of the prophecies of Ezekiel, uttered before the
destruction of Jerusalem, was fulfilled, so every prediction
of glory and blessing in the prophecies spoken after the
destruction of the city will be fulfilled. It all awaits His
coming and glorious appearing. Let us hold fast this and
leave the accomplishment of every detail to the Lord.


III. The Gates of the City and its new Name.

And these are the goings out of the city on the north side,
four thousand and five hundred measures. And the gates of the
city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates
northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.
And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three
gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of[345]
Dan. And at the south side four thousand and five hundred
measures: and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of
Issachar, one gate of Zebulun. At the west side four thousand
and five hundred, with their three gates; one gate of Gad, one gate
of Asher, one gate of Naphtali. It was round about eighteen thousand
measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be,
The Lord is there (verses 30-35).

The city, the earthly Jerusalem, during the Kingdom age,
will have twelve gates, after the twelve tribes of Israel.
The gates on the north side are the gates of Reuben, Judah
and Levi. The gates on the east are those of Joseph, Benjamin
and Dan. Then the gates on the south&mdash;gates of
Simeon, Issachar and Zebulun. The west side gates are
the gates of Gad, Asher and Naphthali. Ephraim and
Manasseh are no longer mentioned, but are represented
in Joseph. Some expositors have made the statement that
the city, Jerusalem with its gates, is an Old Testament
description of the same Jerusalem which John beheld in the
isle of Patmos (Rev. xxi). John saw the new Jerusalem,
Ezekiel the earthly city as it will exist during the Millennium.
There are correspondencies, and yet greater distinctions.
Here in Ezekiel a Temple is the center of the land; in
Revelation we read the seer's word, "I saw no temple therein"
(Rev. xxi:22). The heavenly Jerusalem, like the earthly
Jerusalem in Ezekiel's vision, has the twelve gates and
written on them the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
The wall of the heavenly Jerusalem has twelve foundations,
and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
No wall and no foundations are mentioned by Ezekiel in
connection with the millennial Jerusalem. The heavenly
Jerusalem is four square, "the length and the breadth and
the height of it are equal." Such is not the case with the
earthly city. Nor is there mention made by Ezekiel of the
precious stones, and the twelve gates, composed every gate
of one pearl; nor do we read of golden streets. The earthly[346]
Jerusalem will pass away, and when at last the new heaven
and the new earth have come into existence, after the
millennial reign of Christ, the new Jerusalem will descend
out of heaven and find its eternal resting place upon the new
earth.

The circumference of the city of Jerusalem according to
Ezekiel's vision will be 18,000 reeds, about six miles. Then
comes the majestic ending, the last word the man of God pronounced.
"And the name of that city from that day shall be
'Jehovah Shammah', the Lord is there." It is a fitting finale to
this great Book. In its beginning we see the glory of the Lord
departing. Throughout the pages of the Book we read of
Israel's rebellion, Jerusalem's judgments, the nation's disobedience
and rejection. Then follow the messages of Hope&mdash;Israel's
conversion, the regathering of the twelve tribes,
the final conflict, the returning glory of the Lord; and from
that day the name of the city will be Jehovah Shammah.
Because He has manifested His gracious presence in the midst
of His people and established His throne, blessed His people
with all the spiritual and national blessings promised by
His holy prophets, destroyed all their enemies, and covers
all with His visible glory once more, therefore the city will
have the name "Jehovah is there." What a glory it will
be for Him. The city through which He once walked with
weary feet, the Son of God garbed in servant's form; the
city through which He was dragged, when the cross was
laid upon His shoulders, the city which cast Him out, the
city outside of which He endured the cross and despised the
shame&mdash;that same city will be made in that day the glory
spot of the earth.

[3] The responsibility of Ezekiel in delivering the message was great.
Every servant of the Lord Jesus Christ with a far greater message than
Ezekiel's should also feel that responsibility. If it were felt more, there
would be more earnestness, more prayer and greater results.

[4] Some have concluded on account of this passage, that throughout
the prophetic word wherever "days" are mentioned, they mean
"years." This is incorrect. The "year-day" theory is not a scriptural
one. Where we find days, it means days unless the text itself, as it
is here in Ezekiel, explains the days as years.

[5] Exod. xxviii:38-43; Lev. v:1, 17, vii:8, x:17, etc.

[6] Or spelt, a kind of corn.

[7] The literal meaning is sword, the same as in verse 12.

[8] Another rendering is: "Calamity after calamity!"

[9] The word "fire" is in the Septuagint (ancient Greek Version of the
Old Testament) translated "man" so that it reads "the appearance of
a man." There is a similarity between the Hebrew words for "man"
and "fire." Fire is "esh" and man "ish." Compare with chapter
i:26, 17.

[10] This was three months before the war.

[11] The cherub who handed to the man clothed in linen the fire from
between the cherubim.

[12] Or, "for a little while."

[13] Millennial Dawn, or Associated Bible Students, Restorationists,
etc., do this.

[14] The so-called Anglo-Israel theory lacks all Scriptural and historical
support.

[15] Literal translation is, "O deadly wounded wicked one, the Prince
of Israel."

[16] Literally, Rust.

[17] Moab and Ammon were the incestuous offspring of Lot. (Genesis
xix:37-38.)

[18] It is well to state here that Daniel mentions Antichrist but once
in his prophecies, in chapter xi:36, etc. The little horn in Dan. vii
is the head of the revived Roman Empire; the little horn in Dan. viii
was Antiochus Epiphanus, the type of the King of the North who will
invade the pleasant land, Palestine, during the time of the great tribulation.

[19] For a detailed and excellent exposition of this passage see the book
on "Satan," by F. C. Jennings, pp. 43-48.

[20] The crocodile was often used on Egyptian seal-rings as well as on
Roman coins, which pictured Egypt as a monster crocodile.

[21] Babylon and Egypt, page 192.

[22] Wonders of Prophecy, by J. Urquhart, gives valuable evidence
on the literal fulfillment of Ezekiel's prophecy.

[23] Nebuchadnezzar's name is given by Ezekiel as Nebuchadrezzar.
Both spellings were in vogue. Ezekiel spells the name with "r" and
Jeremiah uses both spellings throughout his book.

[24] This may also be rendered "the day draweth near, even the day of
the Lord draweth near."

[25] See Exposition of Daniel, by A. C. G., on Dan. iii-vi.

[26] "A whale in the seas" is an incorrect translation.

[27] Even so the Lord will yet be known to the nations of the earth by
His judgments.

[28] What is said in this chapter of the false shepherds who ill-treated
the flock of God, His ancient people, may also be applied to the false
shepherds, the hirelings in the professing church. See Acts xx:28-35
and 1 Peter v:2-3.

[29] It is wrong to apply this sentence to water-baptism and claim
for it sprinkling as the proper mode of baptism.

[30] We heard once a Baptist preacher speak on this vision, and he
used the dry bones as a picture of the dead members of his own denomination,
and spoke of them as "the dry bones." A Methodist,
Presbyterian, etc., might do the same.

[31] See "Exposition of Daniel," by A. C. G., page 200.

[32] Wm. Kelly.

[33] The Septuagint translates, "Mesoch and Thobel."

[34] This is the more satisfactory rendering. The marginal reading,
"Strike thee with six plagues" or "draw thee back with a hook of six
teeth" is incorrect.

[35] See "The Prophet Joel," by A. C. G., where this interesting and
important chapter is explained in full.

[36] What strange applications have been made of this vision! We quote
from the "New Century Bible" which says concerning this temple: "Its
details shed a light nowhere else vouchsafed to us upon the ideals of
Hebrew art, influenced perhaps, by Babylonian masterpieces, yet
entirely national and Puritan; and they embody in material form
Ezekiel's sober but intense conception of religion, as completely as
the Gothic cathedrals translate into concrete and abiding stone and
marble the soaring visions of mediaeval Christianity."(!)

[37] May also be translated "and set me upon a very high mountain, and
upon it was as the building of a city, on the south." It will be upon that
exalted mountain.

[38] Seven days the priests had to take in their consecration; on the
eighth day they entered upon their work. Circumcision was practised
on the eighth day, symbolical of the death of Christ and the putting
off of the body of the flesh (Col. ii:1), the entrance into the new creation.
On the eighth day Christ was transfigured and the transfiguration is
a type of His coming into the kingdom. The eighth psalm shows
Him the head of the new creation, with all things under His feet.

[39] The Septuagint gives ten cubits instead of only eleven, which
probably is correct.

[40] The words "which was the breadth of the tabernacle" are by some
declared doubtful. The Septuagint has omitted them.

[41] i. e., To the level place where the side chambers begin.

[42] Corrected text.

[43] See Zech. xiv:4, 8, 10.

[44] Chapter xlv:1-2.

[45] Marginal reading.

[46] Such an application seems warranted in view of the message Ezekiel
received from the Lord to the people (verses 6-12).

[47] "The carcases of their kings" may either mean that some of their
idolatrous kings had been buried within the bounds of the Solomonic
temple, or, the word kings may refer to their idols, which had dominion
over them (Is. xxvi:13). The latter may be the right meaning for the
high place mentioned.

[48] The word "Ariel" as used in Ezekiel has one more letter than the
word in Isaiah xxix.

[49] Zadok means "just." He was the successor of Abiathar in the
priesthood&mdash;the son of Ahitub of the family of Eleazar (2 Sam. viii:17;
1 Kings ii:27, 35).

[50] The sects, like Seventh Day Baptists, Adventists, etc., quote this
passage. They are utterly wrong for this has nothing whatever to
do with the present age.

[51] The Hebrew word translated "leader" is "prince."

[52] Read our comment on this verse.

[53] The sixtieth part of a talent, about fifty shekels.

[54] The Feasts of Jehovah&mdash;Passover: The Cross and its work. First
Fruits: Resurrection of Christ. Pentecost: The Gift of the Spirit
and the calling of the Church. Feast of Trumpets: The Regathering
of Israel. Day of Atonement: Israel's Cleansing. Feast of Tabernacles:
The Millennium.

[55] When it speaks of "my rest" in Hebrews iv it refers to the
eternal rest.

[56] One says: "The double impossibility of the rapid rise of water in the
stream and the course of the river across the steep limestone range
east of Jerusalem into the Dead Sea does not occur to the prophet."
As if Ezekiel had invented this vision.

[57] Ps. lxviii:4 has this word "Arabah;" in the Authorized Version
it is translated "heaven." It is in the plural, "Araboth"&mdash;"Cast up
the way for him that rideth in Araboth"&mdash;the places of death. Christ
is seen prophetically as the Conqueror of death and Sheol.

[58] Consult sketch.





Transcriber's Notes: Some of the outline numbering is incorrect, but has been left as printed.

Obvious printing and punctuation errors have been corrected.

Many words are spelled two different ways, for example "viceregent" and "vice-regent", "today" and "to-day".

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
