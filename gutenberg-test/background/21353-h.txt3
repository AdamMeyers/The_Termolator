INTRODUCTION


It is a common weakness of mankind to be caught by an idea and
captivated by a phrase. To rest therewith content and to neglect the
carrying of the idea into practice is a weakness still more common. It
is this frequent failure of reformers to reduce their theories to
practice, their tendency to dwell in the cloudland of the ideal rather
than to test it in action, that has often made them distrusted and
unpopular.

With our forefathers the phrase mens sana in corpore sano was a high
favorite. It was constantly quoted with approval by writers on hygiene
and sanitation, and used as the text or the finale of hundreds of
popular lectures. And yet we shall seek in vain for any evidence of
its practical usefulness. Its words are good and true, but passive and
actionless, not of that dynamic type where words are "words indeed,
but words that draw armed men behind them."

Our age is of another temper. It yearns for reality. It no longer
rests satisfied with mere ideas, or words, or phrases. The modern
Ulysses would drink life to the dregs. The present age is dissatisfied
with the vague assurance that the Lord will provide, and, rightly or
wrongly, is beginning to expect the state to provide. And while this
desire for reality has its drawbacks, it has also its advantages. Our
age doubts absolutely the virtues of blind submission and resignation,
and cries out instead for prevention and amelioration. Disease is no
longer regarded, as Cruden regarded [vi]it, as the penalty and the
consequence of sin. Nature herself is now perceived to be capable of
imperfect work. Time was when the human eye was referred to as a
perfect apparatus, but the number of young children wearing spectacles
renders that idea untenable to-day.

Meanwhile the multiplication of state asylums and municipal hospitals,
and special schools for deaf or blind children and for cripples,
speaks eloquently and irresistibly of an intimate connection between
civics and health. There is a physical basis of citizenship, as there
is a physical basis of life and of health; and any one who will take
the trouble to read even the Table of Contents of this book will see
that for Dr. Allen prevention is a text and the making of sound
citizens a sermon. Given the sound body, we have nowadays small fear
for the sound mind. The rigid physiological dualism implied in the
phrase mens sana in corpore sano is no longer allowed. To-day the
sound body generally includes the sound mind, and vice versa. If
mental dullness be due to imperfect ears, the remedy lies in medical
treatment of those organs,       not in education of the brain. If lack of
initiative or energy proceeds from defective a      ration of the blood due
to adenoids blocking the air tides in the windpipe, then the remedy
lies not in better teaching but in a simple surgical operation.

Shakespeare, in his wildwood play, saw sermons in stones and books in
the running brooks. We moderns find a drama in the fateful lives of
ordinary mortals, sermons in their physical salvation from some of the
ills that flesh is heir to, and books       like this of Dr. Allen's       in
striving to teach mankind how to become happier, and healthier, and
more useful members of society.

Dr. Allen is undoubtedly a reformer, but of the modern, not the
ancient, type. He is a prophet crying in our present [vii]wilderness; but
he is more than a prophet, for he is always intensely practical,
insisting, as he does, on getting things done, and done soon, and done
right.

No one can read this volume, or even its chapter-headings, without
surprise and rejoicing: surprise, that the physical basis of effective
citizenship has hitherto been so utterly neglected in America;
rejoicing, that so much in the way of the prevention of incapacity and
unhappiness can be so easily done, and is actually beginning to be
done.

The gratitude of every lover of his country and his kind is due to the
author for his interesting and vivid presentation of the outlines of a
subject fundamental to the health, the happiness, and the well-being
of the people, and hence of the first importance to every American
community, every American citizen.

PART I. HEALTH RIGHTS



CHAPTER IToC

HEALTH A CIVIC OBLIGATION


In forty-five states and territories the teaching of hygiene with
special reference to alcohol and tobacco is made compulsory. To
hygiene alone, of the score of subjects found in our modern
grammar-school curriculum, is given statutory right of way for so many
minutes per week, so many pages per text-book, or so many pages per
chapter. For the neglect of no other study may teachers be removed
from office and fined. Yet school garrets and closets are full of
hygiene text-books unopened or little used, while of all subjects
taught by five hundred thousand American teachers and studied by
twenty million American pupils the least interesting to both teacher
and pupil is that forced upon both by state legislation. To complete
the paradox, this least interesting subject happens also to be the
most vital to the child, to the home, to industry, to social welfare,
and to education itself.

Whether the subject of hygiene is necessarily dull, whether the
statutes requiring regular instruction in the laws of health are
violated with impunity, whether health principles are flaunted by
health practice at school,       these are questions of immediate concern
to parents as a class, to employers as a class, to every pastor, every
civic leader, every health officer, every taxpayer.

Interviews with teachers and principals regarding the present apathy
to formal hygiene instruction have brought [4]out the following points
that merit the serious consideration of those who are struggling for
higher health standards.

1. There is many a slip 'twixt the making of a law and its
enforcement. If laws regarding hygiene instruction are not enforced,
we should not be surprised. It has been nobody's business to see
whether and how hygiene is being taught. The moral crusade spent
itself in forcing compulsory laws upon the statute books of every
state and territory. Making a fetish of Legislation, the advocates
of anti-alcohol and anti-tobacco instruction failed to see the truth
that experienced political reformers are but slowly coming to
see       Legislation which does not provide machinery for its own
enforcement is apt to do little good and frequently will do much
harm. Machinery, however admirably adapted to the work to be done,
will get out of order and become useless, or even harmful, unless
constantly watched and efficiently directed. Of what possible use is
it to say that state money may be withheld from any school board which
fails to enforce the law regarding instruction in hygiene, if state
officials never enforce the penalty? So long as the penalty is not
enforced for flagrant violation, what difference does it make whether
the reason is indifference, ignorance, or desire to thwart the law?
Fortunately, it is easy for each one of us to learn how often and in
what way the children in our community are being taught hygiene, and
how the schools of our state teach and practice the laws of health. If
either the spirit or the letter of the law regarding instruction in
hygiene is being violated, we can measure the penalty paid in health
and morals by our children and our community. We can learn whether
law, text-book, curriculum, or teacher should be changed. We can
insist upon discussion of the facts and upon remedies suggested by the
facts.

2. Teachers give as one reason for neglecting hygiene, that they are
often compelled to struggle with a curriculum which [5]requires more
than they are able to teach and more than pupils are able to learn in
the time allowed. While an overcharged curriculum may explain, it
surely does not justify, the violation of law and the dropping of
hygiene from our school curriculum. If there is any class of citizen
who should teach and practice respect for law as law, it is the
teacher. Parents, school directors, county and state superintendents,
university presidents, social workers, owe it not only to themselves,
but to the American school-teacher, either to repeal the laws that
enjoin instruction in hygiene or else so to adjust the curriculum that
teachers can comply with those laws. The present situation that
discredits both law and hygiene is most demoralizing to teacher,
pupil, and community. Many of us might admire the man teacher who
frankly says he never explains the evils of cigarettes because he
himself is an inveterate smoker of cigarettes. But what must we think
of the school system that shifts to such a man the right and the
responsibility of deciding whether or not to explain to underfed and
overstimulated children of the slums the truth regarding cigarettes?
If practice and precept must be consistent, shall the man be removed,
shall he change his habits, shall the law regarding instruction in
hygiene be changed, or shall other provision be made for bringing
child and essential facts together in a way that will not dull the
child's receptivity?

3. Teachers are made to feel that while arithmetic and reading are
essential, hygiene is not essential. Whatever may be the facts
regarding the relative value of arithmetic and hygiene, whether or not
our state legislators have made a mistake in declaring hygiene to be
essential, are questions altogether too important for child and state
to be left to the discretion of the individual teacher or
superintendent. It is fair to the teachers who say they cannot afford
to turn aside from the three R's to teach hygiene, to admit [6]that they
have not hitherto identified the teaching of hygiene with the
promotion of the physical welfare of children. Teachers awake to the
opportunity will sacrifice not only hygiene but any other subject for
the sake of promoting children's health. They do not really believe
that arithmetic is more important than health. What they mean to say
is that hygiene, as taught by them, has not heretofore had an
appreciable effect upon their pupils' health; that other agencies
exist, outside of the school, to teach the child how to avoid certain
diseases and how to observe the fundamental laws of health, whereas no
other agencies exist to give the child the essentials of arithmetic,
reading, and geography. "We teach (or try to teach) what our classes
are examined in. If you want a subject taught, you must test a class
in it and hold a teacher responsible for results, and examinations are
mercilessly unhygienic, you know."

4. Teachers believe that they get better results for their children
from teaching hygiene informally and indirectly than from stated
formal lessons. Whether instruction should be informal or formal is
merely a question of method to be determined by results. What the
results are, can be determined by principals, superintendents, and
students of education. It is easy to understand how at the time of a
fever epidemic children could be taught as much in one week about
infection, disease germs, antiseptics, value of cleanliness, etc., as
in five or ten months when vivid illustration is lacking. Physicians
themselves learn more from one epidemic of smallpox than from four
years of book study. To make possible and to require a daily shower
bath will undoubtedly do more to inculcate habits of health than
repeated lessons about the skin, pores, evaporation, and discharge of
impurities.

If one illustration is better than ten lessons, if an open window is
worth more than all that text-books have to say [7]about ventilation, if
a seat adjusted to the child is better than an anatomical chart, this
does not mean that instruction in hygiene should cease. On the
contrary, it means that provision should be made for every teacher to
open windows, to adjust desks, to use the experience of individual
children for the education of the class. If the rank and file of
teachers have not hitherto been sufficiently observant of
physiological and hygienic facts, if they are unprepared from their
own lives to detect or to furnish illustrations for the child, this
again does not mean that the child should be denied the illustrations,
but that the teacher should either have instruction and experience to
incite interest and to stimulate powers of observation, or else be
asked to give place to another teacher who is able to furnish such
qualifications.

5. Children, like adults, can be interested in other people, in rules
of conduct, in social conditions, in living and working relations more
easily than in their own bodies. The normal, healthy child thinks
very little of himself apart from the other boys and girls, the games,
the studies, the animals, the nature wonders, the hardships that come
to him from the outside. So true is this that one of the best means of
mitigating or curing many ailments is to divert the child's attention
from himself to things outside of himself that he can look at, hear,
enjoy. The power to concentrate attention upon oneself is a sign
either of a diseased body, a diseased mind, or a highly trained mind.
To study others and to recognize the similarity between others and
oneself is as natural as the body itself. Teachers are consulting this
line of easiest access to children's attention when they honor
children according to cleanliness of hands, of teeth, of shoes. Human
interest attaches to what parks or excursions are doing for sickly
children, how welfare work is improving factory employees, how
smallpox is conquered by vaccination, how insurance companies [8]refuse
to take risks upon the lives of men or women addicted to the excessive
use of alcohol or tobacco.

Other people's interests       tenement conditions, factory rules       can be
described in figures and actions that appeal to the imagination and
impress upon the mind pictures that are repeatedly reawakened by
experience and observation on the playground, at home, on the way to
school or to work. "Once upon a time       " will always arrest attention
more quickly than "The human frame consists       ." What others think of
me helps me to obey law       statutory, moral, or hygienic       more than what
I know of law itself. How social instincts dominate may be illustrated
by an experience in advertising a public bath near a thoroughfare
traveled daily by thousands of working girls. I prepared a card to be
distributed among these girls that began: "A cool, refreshing bath,
etc." This card was criticised by one who knows the ways of girls and
women, as follows: "Of course you get no success when you have a man
stand on the street corner and pass out cards telling girls to get
clean. Every girl that is worth while is affronted by the
insinuation." Acting upon this expert advice, we then got out a neatly
printed card reading as follows: "For a clear complexion, sprightly
step, and bounding vitality, visit the Center Market Baths, open from
6 A.M. to 9 P.M. daily." The board of managers shook
their sage masculine heads and reluctantly gave permission to issue
these appeals. Woman's judgment was vindicated, however, and the
advantage was proved of urging health for "society's" sake rather than
for health's sake, when the patronage of the bath jumped at once to
considerable proportions.

6. Other people's habits of health influence our well-being quite as
much, if not more, than our own. Because we are social beings,
ability to get along with our families, our friends, our employers,
is       at least so it seems to most of us       quite as important as
individual health. For too [9]many of us, living hygienically is
absolutely impossible without inconveniencing and bothering the
majority of persons with whom we live. I remember a girl in
college,       a fresh-air fiend,       who every morning, no matter how cold,
threw the windows wide open. Then, with forty others, I thought this
girl a nuisance as well as a menace to health, but now, twenty years
afterwards, I find myself wanting to do the same thing. Professor
Patten, the economist, whom I shall quote many times because he is
particularly interested in the purpose of this book, was recently
dining at my house and illustrated from his own health the importance
of teaching hygiene so as to affect social as well as personal
standards. "To be true to my own health needs, I ought to have
declined nearly everything that has been offered me for dinner, but in
the long run, if I am going to visit, my eating what is placed before
me is better for society than making those who entertain me feel
uncomfortable."

Most of us know what uphill work it is to live hygienically in an
unhygienic environment. I remember how hard it was to eat happily when
sitting beside a college professor who took brown pills before each
meal, yellow pills between each course, and a dose of black medicine
after the meal was over. Mariano, an Italian lad cured of bone
tuberculosis by out-of-door salt air at Sea Breeze, returned to his
tenement home an ardent apostle of fresh air day and night, winter and
summer. His family allowed him to open the window before going to bed,
but closed it as soon as he was asleep. Lawrence Veiller, our greatest
expert on tenement conditions, says: "To bathe in a tenement where a
family of six occupy three rooms often involves the sacrifice of
privacy and decency, which are quite as important to social betterment
as cleanliness."

To live unhygienically where others live hygienically is quite as
difficult. Witness the speedy improvement of dissipated men when
boarding with country friends who eat [10]rationally and retire early. It
must have been knowledge of this fact that prompted the tramways of
Belfast to post conspicuous notices: "Spitting is a vile and filthy
habit, and those who practice it subject themselves to the disgust and
loathing of their fellow-passengers." It is almost impossible to have
indigestion, blues, and headache when one is camping, particularly
where action and enjoyment fill the day. Our practical question is,
therefore, not "What shall I eat, how many hours shall I sleep, what
shall I wear," but "How can I manage to get into an environment among
living and working conditions where the people I live with and want to
please, those who influence me and are influenced by me, make healthy
living easy and natural?"

7. Because the problems of health have to do principally with
environment,       home, street, school, business,       it is worth while
trying to relate hygiene instruction to industry and government, to
preach health from the standpoint of industrial and national
efficiency rather than of individual well-being. Since healthful
living requires the co      peration of all persons in a household, in a
group, or in a community, we must find some working programme that
will make it easy for all the members of the group to observe health
standards. A city government that spends taxes inefficiently can
produce more sickness, wretchedness, incapacity in one year than
pamphlets on health can offset in a generation. Failure to enforce
health laws is a more serious menace to health and morals than
drunkenness or tobacco cancer. Unclean streets, unclean dairies,
unclean, overcrowded tenements can do more harm than alcohol and
tobacco because they can breed an appetite that craves stimulants and
drugs. Others have taught how the body acts, what we ought to eat, how
we should live. We are concerned here not with repeating the laws of
health, but with a consideration of the mechanism that will make it
possible for us so to work together that we can observe those laws.






[11]

CHAPTER IIToC

SEVEN HEALTH MOTIVES AND SEVEN CATCHWORDS


In making a health programme as in making a boat, a garden, or a
baseball team, the first step is to look about and see what material
there is to work with. A baseball team will fail miserably unless the
captain places each man where he can play best. Gardening is
profitless when the gardener does not know the habits of plants and
the possibilities of different kinds of soil. So in planning a health
programme we must study our materials and use each where it will fit
best. The materials of first importance to a health programme in
civilized countries are men; for men working together can control
water sources, drainage, and ventilation, or else move away to
surroundings better suited to healthful living. Therefore the first
concern of the leader in a health crusade is the human kind he has to
work for and work with.

Seven kinds of man are to be found in every community, seven different
points of view with regard to health administration. Each individual,
likewise, may have seven attitudes toward health laws, seven reasons
for demanding health protection. These seven points of view, seven
stages of development, are clearly marked in the evolution of sanitary
administration throughout the civilized world. With few exceptions, it
is possible, by examining ourselves, our friends, and our communities,
to see where one motive begins and leaves off, giving way to or mixing
with one or more other motives. A friend once asked me if I could keep
this number seven from growing to eight or nine. Perhaps not. Perhaps
there are more kinds of people, [12]more health motives, more stages in
health progress; but I am sure of these seven, and certain that they
have been of great help to me in planning health crusades for the
state of New Jersey and for New York City. The number seven was not
reached hit-or-miss fashion, nor was it chosen for its biblical
prestige. On the contrary, it came as the result of studying health
administration in twoscore British and American cities, and of reading
scores of books on sanitary evolution.

Seven catchwords make it easy to remember the characteristics and the
source of every motive, every kind of person, and every stage in the
evolution of sanitary standards. These seven catchwords are:
Instinct, Display, Commerce, Anti-nuisance, Anti-slum,
Pro-slum, Rights. By the use of these catchwords any teacher,
parent, public official, educator, or social worker should be able to
size up the situation, the needs, and the opportunity of the
individuals or the communities for whom a health crusade is planned.

Instinct was the first health officer and made the first health
laws. Instinct warns us against unusual and offensive odors, sights,
and noises, just as it causes us to seek that which is agreeable.
Primitive man in common with other animals learned by sad experience
to avoid certain herbs as poisons; to bury or to move away from the
dead; to shun discolored drinking water. During the roaming period sun
and air and water acted as scavengers. When tribes settled down in one
spot for long periods, habits that had hitherto been inoffensive and
safe became noticeably injurious and unpleasant. Heads of tribes gave
orders prohibiting such habits and restricting disagreeable acts and
objects to certain portions of the camp. Instinct places outhouses on
our farms and then gradually removes them farther and farther from
dwellings. In many school yards, more particularly in country
districts and small towns, [13]outhouses are a crying offense against
animal instinct. In visiting slum districts in Irish and Scotch
cities, and in London, Paris, Berlin, and New York, I never found
conditions so offensive to crude animal instinct as those I knew when
a boy in Minnesota school yards, or those I have since seen in a Boy
Republic. But the evil is not corrected because it is not made
anybody's business to execute instinct's mandates. In the Boy Republic
the leaders were waiting for the children themselves to revolt, as
does primitive man.

Among large numbers of persons, in city as well as country, washing
the body is still a matter of instinct, a bath not being taken until
the body is offensive, the hands not being washed until their
condition interferes with the enjoyment of food or with one's
treatment by others. There is a point of neglect beyond which instinct
will not [14]permit even a tramp to go. If cleanliness is next to
godliness, the average child is most ungodly by nature, for it loathes
the means of cleanliness and otherwise observes instinct's health
warnings only after experience has punished or after other motives
from the outside have prompted action. The chief form of legislation
of the instinct age is provision of penalties for those who poison
food, water, or fellow-man. There are districts in America where
hygiene is supposed to be taught to children that are conscious of no
other sanitary legislation but that which punishes the poisoner.

Display has always been an active health crusader. Professor Patten
says the best thing that could happen to the slums of every city would
be for every girl and woman to be given white slippers, white
stockings, a white dress, and white hat. Why? Because they would at
once notice and resent the dirt on the street, in their hallways, and
in their own homes. People that have nothing to "spoil" really do not
see dirt, for it interferes in no way with their comfort so far as
they can see. Their windows are crusted with dust, their babies' milk
bottles are yellow with germs. Who cares? Similar conditions exist
among well-to-do women who live on isolated farms with no one to
notice their personal appearance except others of the family who
prefer rest to cleanliness. But let the tenement mother or the
isolated farmer's wife entertain the minister or the school-teacher,
the candidate for sheriff or the ward boss, let her go to Coney Island
or to the county fair, and at once an outside standard is set up that
requires greater regard for personal appearance and leads to "cleaning
up."

Elbow sleeves and light summer waists have led many a girl to daily
bathing of at least those parts of the body that other people see.
Entertainments and sociables, Saturday choir practice and church have
led many a young man to bathe for others' sake when quite satisfied
[15]to forego the ordeal so far as his own comfort and health were
concerned. Streets on which the well-to-do live are kept clean. Why?
Not because Madam Well-to-do cares so much for health, but because she
associates cleanliness with social prestige. It is necessary for the
display of her carriages and dresses, just as paved streets and a
plentiful supply of water for public baths and private homes were
essential to the display of Rome's luxury. Generally speaking,
residence streets are cleaned in small towns just as waterworks are
introduced, to gratify the display motive of those who have lawns to
water and clothes to show.

Instinct strengthens the display motive. As every one can be
interested in instinct hygiene, so every one is capable of this
display motive to the extent that his position is affected by other
people's opinion. It was love of display quite as much as love of
beauty that gave Greece the goddess Hygeia, the worship of whom
expressed secondarily a desire for universal health, and primarily a
love of the beautiful among those who had leisure to enjoy it.

Commerce brooks no preventable interference with profits, whether by
disease, death, impassable streets, or disabled men. The age of
chivalry was also the age of indescribable filth, plague, Black Death,
and spotted fever that cost the lives of millions. It would be
impossible in the civilized world to duplicate the combination of
luxury and filthy, disease-breeding conditions in the midst of which
Queen Bess and her courtiers held their revels. The first protest was
made, not by the church, not by sanitarians, but by the great
merchants who were unable to insure against loss and ruin from the
plagues that thrived on filth and overcrowding. By an interesting
coincidence the first systematic street cleaning and the first
systematic ship cleaning       maritime quarantine       date from the same
year, 1348 A.D.; the former in the foremost German [16]trading
town, Cologne, and the latter in Venice, the foremost trading town of
Italy. The merchants of Philadelphia and New York started the first
boards of health in the United States. For what purpose? To prevent
business losses from yellow fever. Desire for passable streets,
drains, waterworks, and strong boards of health has generally started
with merchants. For commercial reasons many of our states vote more
money for the protection of cattle than for the protection of human
life, and the United States votes millions for the study of hog
cholera, chicken pip, and animal tuberculosis, while neglecting
communicable diseases of men. No class in a community will respond
more quickly to an appeal for the rigid enforcement of health laws
than the merchant class; none will oppose so bitterly as that which
makes profits out of the violation of health laws.

[17]Anti-nuisance motives do not affect health laws until people with
different incomes and different tastes try to live together. In a
small town where everybody keeps a cow and a pig, piggeries and
stables offend no one; but when the doctor, the preacher, the
dressmaker, the lawyer, and the leading merchant stop keeping pigs and
cows, they begin to find other people's stables and piggeries
offensive. The early laws against throwing garbage, fish heads,
household refuse, offal, etc., on the main street were made by kings
and princes offended by such practices. The word "nuisance" was coined
in days when neighbors lived the same kind of life and were not
sensitive to things like house slops, ash piles, etc. The first
nuisances were things that neighbors stumbled over or ran into while
using the public highway. Next, goats and other animals interfering
with safety were described as nuisances, and legal protection against
them was worked out. It has never been necessary to change the maxim
which originally defined a nuisance: "So use your own property that
you will not injure another in the use of his property." The thing
that has changed and grown has been society's knowledge of acts and
objects that prevent a man from enjoying his own property. To-day the
number of things that the law calls nuisances is so great that it
takes hundreds of pages to describe them. Stables and outhouses must
be set back from the street. Every man must dispose of garbage and
drainage on his own property. Stables and privies must be at least a
hundred feet from water reservoirs. Factories may not pollute streams
that furnish drinking water. Merchants may be punished if they put
banana skins in milk cans, or if they fail to scald and cleanse all
milk receptacles before returning them to wholesalers. Automobile
drivers may be punished for disturbing sleep. Anything that injures my
health will be declared a nuisance and abolished, if I can prove that
my health is being injured and that I am doing all I can to [18]avoid
that injury. No educational work will accomplish more for any
community than to make rich and poor alike conscious of nuisances that
are being committed against themselves and their neighbors. The rich
are able to run away from nuisances that they cannot have abated. If
proper publicity is given to living conditions among those who do not
resist nuisances, the presence of such conditions will itself become
offensive to the well-to-do, who will take steps to remove the
nuisance. Jacob Riis in this way made the slums a nuisance to rich
residents in New York City and stimulated tenement reform, building of
parks, etc.

Anti-slum motives originated in cities where there is a clear
dividing line between the clean and the unclean, the infected and the
uninfected, the orderly and the disorderly, high and low vitality. As
soon as one district becomes definitely known as a source of nuisance,
infection, and disease, better situated districts begin to make laws
to protect themselves. A great part of our existing health codes and a
very large part of the funds spent on health administration are
designed to protect those of high income against disease incident to
those of low income, high vitality against low vitality, houses with
rooms to spare against houses that are overcrowded. To the small town
and the country the slum means generally the near-by city whose papers
talk of epidemic scarlet fever, diphtheria, or smallpox. Cities have
only recently begun to experience anti-slum aversion to country
dairies whose uncleanliness brings infected milk to city babies, or to
filthy factories and farms that pollute water reservoirs and cause
typhoid. The last serious smallpox epidemic in the East came from the
South by way of rural districts that failed to notify the Pennsylvania
state board of health of the outbreak until the disease was scattered
broadcast. Every individual knows of some family or some district that
is immediately pictured when terms like "disease," "epidemic," "slum,"
are [19]pronounced. The steps worked out by the anti-slum motive to
protect "those who have" from disease arising from "those who have
not" are given on page 31.




A COUNTRY MENACE TO CITY HEALTH


Pro-slum motives are not exactly born of anti-slum motives, but,
thanks to the instinctive kindness of the human heart, follow promptly
after the dangers of the slum have been described. You and I work
together to protect ourselves against neglect, nuisance, and disease.
In a district by which we must pass and with which we must deal, one
of us or a neighbor or friend will turn our attention from our danger
to the suffering of those against whom we wish to protect ourselves.
Charles Dickens so described Oliver Twist and David Copperfield that
Great Britain organized societies and secured legislation to improve
the almshouse, school, and working and living conditions. When health
reports, newspapers, and charitable societies [20]make us see that the
slum menaces our health and our happiness, we become interested in the
slum for its own sake. We then start children's aid societies,
consumer's leagues, sanitary and prison associations, child-labor
committees, and "efficient government" clubs.

Rights motives are the last to be evolved in individuals or
communities. The well-to-do protect their instinct, their comfort,
their commerce, but run away from the slums and build in the secluded
spots or on the well-policed and well-cleaned avenues and boulevards.
Uptown is often satisfied with putting health officials to work to
protect it against downtown. Pro-slum motives are shared by too few
and are expressed too irregularly to help all of those who suffer from
crowded tenements, impure milk, unclean streets, inadequate schooling.
So long as those who suffer have no other protection than the
self-interest or the benevolence of those better situated, disease and
hardship inevitably persist. Health administration is incomplete until
its blessings are given to men, women, and children as rights that can
be enforced through courts, as can the right to free speech, the
freedom of the press, and trial by jury. There is all the difference
in the world between having one's street clean because it is a danger
to some distant neighbor, or because that neighbor takes some
philanthropic interest in its residents, and because one has a right
to clean streets, regardless of the distant neighbor's welfare or
interest. When the right to health is granted health laws are made,
and all men within the jurisdiction of the lawmaking power own health
machinery that provides for the administration of those laws. A system
of public baths takes the place of a bathhouse supported by charity; a
law restricting the construction and management of all tenements takes
the place of a block of model tenements, financed by some wealthy man;
medical examination of all school children takes the place of a
private dispensary; [21]a probation law takes the place of the friendly
visitor to the county jail.

Most of the rights we call inalienable are political rights no longer
questioned by anybody and no longer thought of in connection with our
everyday acts, pleasures, and necessities. When our political rights
were formulated in maxims, living was relatively simple. There was no
factory problem, no transportation problem, no exploitation of women
and children in industry. Our ancestors firmly believed that if the
strong could be prevented from interfering with the political rights
of the weak, all would have an equal chance. The reason that our
political maxims mean less to-day than two hundred years ago is that
nobody is challenging our right to move from place to place if we can
afford it, to trial by jury if charged with crime, to speak or print
the truth about men or governments. If, however, anybody should
interfere with our freedom in this respect, it would be of tremendous
help that everybody we know would resent such interference and would
point to maxims handed down by our ancestors and incorporated in our
national and state constitutions as formal expressions of unanimous
public opinion.

The time is past when any one seriously believes that political
freedom or personal liberty will be universal, just because everybody
has a right to talk, to move from place to place, to print stories in
the newspapers. The relation of man to man to-day requires that we
formulate rules of action that prevent one man's taking from another
those rights, economic and industrial, that are as essential to
twentieth-century happiness as were political rights to
eighteenth-century happiness. Political maxims showed how, through
common desire and common action, steps could be taken by the
individual and by the whole of society for the protection of all.
Health rights, likewise, are to be obtained through common action. A
modern city must [22]know who is accountable when an automobile runs over
a pedestrian, when a train load of passengers lose their lives because
of an engineer's carelessness, when an employee is incapacitated for
work by an accident for which he is not responsible, or when fever
epidemics threaten life and liberty without check. How can a child who
is prevented by removable physical defects from breathing through his
nose be enthusiastic over free speech? Of what use is freedom of the
press to those who find reading harder than factory toil? How futile
the right to trial by jury if removable physical defects make children
unable to do what the law expects! Who would not exchange rights of
petition for ability to earn a living? Children permanently
incapacitated to share the law's benefits cannot appreciate the
privilege of pursuing happiness.

Succeeding chapters will enumerate a number of health rights and will
show through what means we can work together to guarantee that we
shall not injure the health of our neighbor and that our neighbor
shall not injure our health. The truest index to economic status and
to standards of living is health environment. The best criterion of
opportunity for industrial and political efficiency is the conditions
affecting health. The seven catchwords that describe seven motives to
health legislation and health administration, seven ways of
approaching health needs, and seven reasons for meeting them, should
be found helpful in analyzing the problem confronting the individual
leader. Generally speaking, we cannot watch political rights grow, but
health rights are evolved before our eyes all the time. If we wish, we
can see in our own city or township the steps taken, one by one, that
have slowly led to granting a large number of health rights to every
American.

CHAPTER IIIToC

WHAT HEALTH RIGHTS ARE NOT ENFORCED IN YOUR COMMUNITY?


Laws define rights. Men enforce them. For definitions we go to books.
For record of enforcement we go to acts and to conditions.[3] What
health rights a community pretends to enforce will, as a rule, be
found in its health code. What health rights are actually enforced can
be learned only by studying both the people who are to be protected
and the conditions in which these people live. A street, a cellar, a
milk shop, a sick baby, or an adult consumptive tells more honestly
the story of health rights enforced and health rights unenforced than
either sanitary code or sanitary squad. Not until we turn our
attention from definition and official to things done and dangers
remaining can we learn the health progress and health needs of any
city or state.

The health code of one city looks very much like the health code of
every other city. This is natural because those who write health codes
generally copy other codes. Even small cities are given complicated
sanitary legislative powers by state legislatures. Therefore those who
judge a community's health rights by its health laws will get as
erroneous an impression as those who judge hygiene instruction in our
public schools from printed statements about the frequency and
character of such instruction. Advocates of health codes have thought
the battle won when boards of health were given almost unlimited power
to abate nuisances and told how to exercise those powers.

[24]


A DAIRY INSPECTOR'S OUTFIT


The slip 'twixt law making and law enforcement is everywhere found. In
1864 New York state prohibited the sale of adulterated milk. Law after
law has been made since that time, giving health officials power to
revoke licenses of milk dealers and to send men to jail who violated
milk laws. We now know that no law will ever stop the present
frightful waste of infant lives, counted in thousands annually, unless
dairies are frequently inspected and forced to be clean; unless milk
is kept at a temperature of about fifty degrees on the train, in the
creamery, at the receiving station, and in the milk shop; unless
dealers scald and thoroughly cleanse cans in which milk is shipped;
unless licenses are taken from farmers, creameries, and retailers who
violate the law; unless magistrates use their power to fine or
imprison those who poison helpless babies by violating milk laws; and
unless mothers are taught to scald [25]and thoroughly cleanse bottles,
nipples, cups, and dishes from which milk is fed to the baby. We know
that these things are not being done except where men or women make it
their business to see that they are done. Experience tells us that
inspectors will not consistently do their duty unless those who direct
them have regular records of their inspections, study those records,
find out work not done properly or promptly, and insist upon thorough
inspection.

Whether work is done right, whether inspectors do their full duty,
whether babies are protected, can be learned only from statements in
black and white that show accurately the conditions of dairies and
milk shops, the character of milk found and tested by inspectors, and
the number of babies known to have been sick or known to have died
from intestinal diseases chiefly due to unsafe milk. Any teacher or
parent can learn for himself, or can teach children to learn, what
steps are taken to guarantee the right to pure milk by using a table
such as Table III. Whether conditions at the dairy make pure milk
impossible can be told by any one who can read the score card used by
New York City (Table IV).

[29]It is a great pity that we Americans have taken so long to learn that
laws do not enforce themselves, that even good motives and good
intentions in the best of officials do not insure good deeds. Thousands
of lives are being lost every year, millions of days taken from
industry and wasted by unnecessary sickness, millions of dollars spent
on curing disease, the working life of the nation shortened, the hours
of enjoyment curtailed, because we have not seen the great gap between
health laws and health-law enforcement. In our municipal, state, and
national politics we have made the same mistake of concentrating our
attention upon the morals and pretensions of candidates and officials
instead of judging government by what government does. Gains of men and
progress of law are useful to mankind only when converted into deeds
that make men freer in the enjoyment of health and earning power. In
protecting health, as in reforming government, an ounce of efficient
achievement is worth infinitely more than a moral explosion. One month
of routine       unpicturesque, unexciting efficiency       will accomplish more
than a scandal or catastrophe. Such routine is possible only when
special machinery is constantly at work, comparing work done with work
expected, health practice with health ideals. Where such machinery does
not yet exist, volunteers, civic leagues, boys' brigades, etc., can
easily prove the need for it by filling out an improvised score card
for the school building, railroad station, business streets,
"well-to-do" and poor resident streets, such as follows:

[30]Until recently the most reliable test of health rights not enforced
was the number of cases of preventable, communicable, contagious,
infectious, transmissible diseases, such as smallpox, typhoid fever,
yellow fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles, whooping cough. By
noticing streets and houses where these diseases occurred, students
learned a century ago that the darker and more congested the street
the greater the prevalence of fevers and the greater the chance that
one attacked would die. The well-to-do remove from their houses and
their streets the dirt, the decomposed garbage, and stagnant pools
from which fevers seem to spring. It was because fevers and congestion
go together that laws were made to protect the well-to-do, the
comfortable, and the clean against the slum. It is true to-day that if
you study your city and stick a pin in the map, street for street,
where infection is known to exist, you will find the number steadily
increase as you go from uncongested to congested streets and houses,
from districts of high rent to districts of low rent. Because it is
easier to learn the number of persons who have measles and diphtheria
and smallpox than it is to learn the incomes and living conditions
prejudicial to health, and because our laws grant protection against
communicable diseases to a child in whatever district he may be born,
the record of cases of communicable diseases has heretofore been the
best test of health rights unenforced. Even in country schools it
would make a good lesson in hygiene and civics to have the children
keep a record of absences on account of transmissible disease, and
then follow up the record with a search for conditions that gave the
disease a good chance.

But to wait for contagion before taking action has been found an
expensive way of learning where health protection is needed. Even when
infected persons and physicians are prompt in reporting the presence
of disease it is often [31]found that conditions that produced the
disease have been overlooked and neglected.

For example, smallpox comes very rarely to our cities to-day. Wherever
boards of health are not worried by "children's diseases," as is often
the case, and wait for some more fearful disease such as smallpox,
there you will find that garbage in the streets, accumulated filth,
surface sewers, congested houses, badly ventilated, unsanitary school
buildings and churches are furnishing a soil to breed an epidemic in a
surprisingly short time. Where, on the other hand, boards of health
regard every communicable disease as a menace to health rights, you
will find that health officials take certain steps in a certain order
to remove the soil in which preventable diseases grow. These steps,
worked out by the sanitarians of Europe and America after a century of
experiment, are seen to be very simple and are applicable by the
average layman and average physician to the simplest village or rural
community. How many of these steps are taken by your city? by your
county? by your state?



1. Notification of danger when it is first recognized.

2. Registration at a central office of facts as to each dangerous
thing or person.

3. Examination of the seat of danger to discover its extent, its
cost, and new seats of danger created by it.

4. Isolation of the dangerous thing or person.

5. Constant attention to prevent extension to other persons or
things.

6. Destruction or removal of disease germs or other causes of
danger.

7. Analysis and record, for future use, of lessons learned by
experience.

8. Education of the public to understand its relation to danger
checked or removed, its responsibility for preventing a recurrence
of the same danger, and the importance of promptly recognizing and
checking similar danger elsewhere.



[32]With a chart showing what districts have the greatest number of
children and adults suffering from measles, typhoid fever, scarlet
fever, consumption, one can go within his own city or to a strange
city and in a surprisingly short time locate the nuisances, the
dangerous buildings, the open sewers, the cesspools, the houses
without bathing facilities, the dark rooms, the narrow streets, the
houses without play space and breathing space, the districts without
parks, the polluted water sources, the unsanitary groceries and milk
shops. In country districts a comparison of town with town as to the
prevalence of infection will enable one easily to learn where slop
water is thrown from the back stoop, whether the well, the barn, and
the privy are near together.




THE BABY, NOT THE LAW, IS THE TEST OF INFANT PROTECTION IN COUNTRY AND IN CITY


Testing health rights requires not only that there be a board of
health keeping track of and publishing every case of infection, but it
requires further that one community be compared with other communities
of similar size, and that each community be compared with itself year
for year. These comparisons have not been made and records do not
exist in many states.

CHAPTER IVToC

THE BEST INDEX TO COMMUNITY HEALTH IS THE PHYSICAL WELFARE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN


Compulsory education laws, the gregarious instinct of children, the
ambition of parents, their self-interest, and the activities of
child-labor committees combine to-day to insure that one or more
representatives of practically every family in the United States will
be in public, parochial, or private schools for some part of the year.
The purpose of having these families represented in school is not only
to give the children themselves the education which is regarded as a
fundamental right of the American child, but to protect the community
against the social and industrial evils and the dangers that result
from ignorance. Great sacrifices are made by state, individual
taxpayer, and individual parent in order that children and state may
be benefited by education. Almost no resistance is found to any demand
made upon parent or taxpayer, if it can be shown that compliance will
remove obstructions to school progress. If, therefore, by any chance,
we can find at school a test of home conditions affecting both the
child's health and his progress at school, it will be easy, in the
name of the school, to correct those conditions, just as it will be
easy to read the index, because the child is under state control for
six hours a day for the greater part of the years from six to
fourteen.[4]

[34]




What, then, is this test of home conditions prejudicial to health that
will register the fact as a thermometer tells us the temperature, or
as a barometer shows moisture and air pressure? The house address
alone is not enough, for many children surrounded by wealth are denied
health rights, such as the right to play, to breathe pure air, to eat
wholesome food, to live sanely. Scholarship will not help, because the
frailest child is often the most proficient. Manners mislead, for,
like dress, they are but externals, the product of emulation, of other
people's influence upon us rather than of our living conditions.
Nationality is an index to nothing significant in America, where all
race and nationality differences melt into Americanisms, all
responding in about the same way to American opportunity. No, our test
must be something that cannot be put on and off, cannot be left at
home, cannot be concealed or pretended, something inseparable from the
child and beyond his control. This test it has been conclusively
proved in Chicago, Boston, Brookline, Philadelphia, and particularly
in New York City, is the physical condition of the school child. To
learn this condition the child must be examined and re      xamined for
[35]the physical signs called for by the card on page 34. Weight, height,
and measurements are needed to tell the whole story.

When this card is filled out for every child in a class or school or
city, the story told points directly to physical, mental, or health
rights neglected. If for every child there is begun a special card,
that will tell his story over and over again during his school life,
noting every time he is sick and every time he is examined, the
progress of the community as well as of the child will be clearly
shown. Such a history card (p. 314) is now in use in certain New York
schools, as well as in several private schools and colleges.

Have you ever watched such an examination? By copying this card your
family physician can give you a demonstration in a very short time as
to the method and advantage of examination at school. The school
physician goes at nine o'clock to the doctor's room in the public
school, or, if there is no doctor's room, to that portion of the hall
or principal's office where the doctor does his work. The teacher or
the nurse stands near to write the physician's decision. The doctor
looks the child over, glances at his eyes, his color, the fullness of
his cheeks, the soundness of his flesh, etc. If the physician says
"B," the principal or nurse marks out the other letter opposite to
number 1, so that the card shows that there is bad nutrition.

In looking at the teeth and throat a little wooden stick is used to
push down the tongue. There should be a stick for every child, so that
infection cannot possibly be carried from one to the other. If this is
impossible, the stick should be dipped in an antiseptic such as boric
acid or listerine. If, because of swollen tonsils, there is but a
little slit open in the throat, or if teeth are decayed, the mark is Y
or B. The whole examination takes only a couple of minutes, but the
physician often finds out in this short time facts that will save a
boy and his parents a great deal of trouble. Very often this
examination tells a story that overworked [36]mothers have studiously
concealed by bright ribbons and clean clothes. I remember one little
girl of fourteen who looked very prosperous, but the physician found
her so thin that he was sure that for some time she had eaten too
little, and called her an       mic. He later found that the mother had
seven children whom she was trying to clothe and shelter and feed with
only ten dollars a week. A way was found to increase her earnings and
to give all the children better living conditions,       all because of the
short story told by the examination card. In another instance the
card's story led to the discovery of recent immigrant parents earning
enough, but, because unacquainted with American ways and with their
new home, unable to give their children proper care.




LOOKING FOR ENLARGED TONSILS AND BAD TEETHNote the mouth breather waiting


The most extensive inquiry yet made in the United States as to the
physical condition of school children is that conducted by the board
of health in New York City since 1905. From March, 1905, to January 1,
1908, 275,641 children have been examined, and 198,139 or 71.9 per
cent have been found to have defects, as shown in Table VI.

It is generally believed that New York children must have more defects
than children elsewhere. If this assumption is wrong, if children in
other parts of the United States are as apt to have eye defects,
enlarged tonsils, and bad teeth as the children of the great
metropolis, then the army of children needing attention would be seven
out of ten, or over 14,000,000.

Whether these figures overstate or understate the truth, the school
authorities of the country should find out. The chances are that the
school in which you are particularly interested is no exception. To
learn what the probable number needing attention is, divide your total
by ten and multiply the result by seven.

[38]The seriousness of every trouble and its particular relation to school
progress and to the general public health will be explained in
succeeding chapters. The point to be made here is that the examination
of the school child discloses in advance of epidemics and breakdowns
the children whose physical condition makes them most likely to "come
down" with "catching diseases," least able to withstand an attack,
less fitted to profit fully from educational and industrial
opportunity.

The only index to community conditions prejudicial to health that will
make known the child of the well-to-do who needs attention is the
record of physical examination. No other means to-day exists by which
the state can, in a recognized and acceptable way, discover the
failure of these well-to-do parents to protect their children's health
and take steps to teach and, if necessary, to compel the parents to
substitute living conditions that benefit for conditions that injure
the child.

Among the important health rights that deserve more emphasis is the
right to be healthy though not "poor." A child's lungs may be weak,
breathing capacity one third below normal, weight and nutrition
deficient, and yet that child cannot contract tuberculosis unless
directly exposed to the germs of that disease. But such a child can
contract chronic hunger, can in a hundred ways pay the penalty for
being pampered or otherwise neglected. Physical examination is needed
to find every child that has too little vitality, no zest for play,
little resistance, even though sent to a private school and kept away
from dirt and contagion.

The New York Committee on the Physical Welfare of School Children
visited fourteen hundred homes of children found to have one or more
of the physical defects shown on the above card. While they found that
low incomes have more than their proper share of defects and of
unsanitary living conditions, yet they saw emphatically [39]also that low
incomes do not monopolize physical defects and unsanitary living
conditions. Many families having $20, $30, $40 a week gave their
children neither medical nor dental care. The share each income had in
unfavorable conditions is shown by the summary in the following table.

The index should be read in all grades from kindergarten to high
school and college.

[40]Last winter the chairman of the Committee on the Physical Welfare of
School Children was invited to speak of physical examination before an
association of high-school principals. He began by saying, "This
question does not concern you as directly as it does the
grammar-school principals, but you can help secure funds to help their
pupils." One after another the high-school principals present
told       one of his own daughter, another of his honor girls, a third of
his honor boys       the same story of neglected headaches due to eye
strain, breakdowns due to undiscovered underfeeding, underexercise, or
overwork. Are we coming to the time when the state will step in to
prevent any boy or girl in high school, college, or professional
school from earning academic honors at the expense of health? Harmful
conditions within schoolrooms and on school grounds will not be
neglected where pupils, teachers, school and family physicians, and
parents set about to find and to remove the causes of physical
defects.

Disease centers outside of school buildings quickly register
themselves in the schoolroom and in the person of a child who is
paying the penalty for living in contact with a disease center. If a
child sleeps in a dark, ill-ventilated, crowded room, the result will
show in his eyes and complexion; if he has too little to eat or the
wrong thing to eat, he will be underweight and undersized; if his
nutrition is inadequate and his food improper, he is apt to have eye
trouble, adenoids, and enlarged tonsils. He may have defective lung
capacity, due to improper breathing, too little exercise in the fresh
air, too little food. Existence of physical defects throws little
light on income at home, but conclusively shows lack of attention or
of understanding. Several days' absence of a child from school leads,
in every well-regulated school, to a visit to the child's home or to a
letter or card asking that the absence be explained. Even newly
arrived immigrants have learned the necessity and [41]the advantage of
writing the teacher an "excuse" when their children are absent.
Furthermore, neighbors' children are apt to learn by friendly inquiry
what the teacher may not have learned by official inquiry, why their
playmate is no longer on the street or at the school desk. While
physicians are sometimes willing to violate the law that compels
notification of infection, rarely would a physician fail to caution an
infected family against an indiscriminate mingling with neighbors.
Whether the family physician is careless or not, the explanation of
the absence which is demanded by the school would give also
announcement of any danger that might exist in the home where the
child is ill.

If it be said that in hundreds of thousands of cases the child labor
law is violated and that therefore school examination is not an index
to the poverty or neglect occasioning such child labor, it should be
remembered that the best physical test is the child's presence at
school. The first step in thorough physical examination is a thorough
school census,       the counting of every child of school age. Moreover, a
relatively small number of children who violate the child labor law
are the only members of the family who ought to be in school. Younger
children furnish the index and occasion the visit that should discover
the violation of law.

Appreciation of health, as well as its neglect, is indexed by the
physical condition of school children. Habits of health are the other
side of the shield of health rights unprotected. Physical examination
will discover what parents are trying to do as well as what they fail
to do because of their ignorance, indifference, or poverty. In so far
as parents are alive to the importance of health, the school
examination furnishes the occasion of enlisting them in crusades to
protect the public health and to enforce health rights. The Committee
on the Physical Welfare of School Children found many parents
unwilling to answer [42]questions as to their own living conditions until
told that the answers would make it easier to get better health
environment not only for their own children but for their neighbors'
children. Generally speaking, fathers and mothers can easily be
interested in any kind of campaign in the name of health and in behalf
of children. The advantage of starting this health crusade from the
most popular American institution, the public school,       the advantage
of instituting corrective work through democratic machinery such as
the public school,       is incalculable. To any teacher, pastor, civic
leader, health official, or taxpayer wanting to take the necessary
steps for the removal of conditions prejudicial to health and for the
enforcement of health rights of child and adult, the best possible
advice is to learn the facts disclosed by the physical examination of
your school children. See that those facts are used first for the
benefit of the children themselves, secondly for the benefit of the
community as a whole. If your school has not yet introduced the
thorough physical examination of school children, take steps at once
to secure such examination. If necessary, volunteer to test the eyes
and the breathing of one class, persuade one or two physicians to
co      perate until you have proved to parent, taxpayer, health official,
and teacher that such an examination is both a money-saving,
energy-saving step and an act of justice.

We shall have occasion to emphasize over and over again the fact that
it is the use of information and not the gathering of information that
improves the health. The United States Weather Bureau saves millions
of dollars annually, not because flags are raised and bulletins issued
foretelling the weather, but because shipowners, sailors, farmers, and
fruit growers obey the warnings. Mere examination of school children
does little good. The child does not breathe better or see better
because the school physician fills out a card stating that there is
[43]something wrong with his eyes, nose, and tonsils. The examination
tells where the need is, what children should have special attention,
what parents need to be warned as to the condition of the child, what
home conditions need to be corrected. If the facts are not used, that
is an argument not against obtaining facts but against disregarding
them.

In understanding medical examination we should keep clearly in mind
the distinction between medical school inspection, medical school
examination, and medical treatment at school. Medical inspection is
the search for communicable disease. The results of medical
inspection, therefore, furnish an index to the presence of
communicable diseases in the community. Medical examination is the
search for physical defects, some of which furnish the soil for
contagion. Its results are an index not only to contagion but to
conditions that favor contagion by producing or aggravating physical
defects and by reducing vitality. Medical treatment at school refers
to steps taken under the school roof, or by school funds, to remove
the defects or check the infection brought to light by medical
inspection and medical examination. Treatment is not an index. In
separate chapters are given the reasons for and against trying to
treat at school symptoms of causes that exist outside of school. When,
how often, and by whom inspection and examination should be made is
also discussed later. The one point of this chapter is this: if we
really want to know where in our community health rights are
endangered, the shortest cut to the largest number of dangers is the
physical examination of children at school,       private, parochial,
reformatory, public, high, college.

Apart from the advantage to the community of locating its health
problems, physical examination is due every child. No matter where his
schooling or at whose expense, every child has the right to advance as
fast as his own powers [44]will permit without hindrance from his own or
his playmates' removable defects. He has the right to learn that
simplified breathing is more necessary than simplified spelling, that
nose plus adenoids makes backwardness, that a decayed tooth multiplied
by ten gives malnutrition, and that hypertrophied tonsils are even
more menacing than hypertrophied playfulness. He has the right to
learn that his own mother in his own home, with the aid of his own
family physician, can remove his physical defects so that it will be
unnecessary for outsiders to give him a palliative free lunch at
school, thus neglecting the cause of his defects and those of
fellow-pupils.





FOOTNOTES:

[4] Sir John E. Gorst in The Children of the Nation reads
the index of the health of school children in the United Kingdom; John
Spargo, in The Bitter Cry of the Children, and Simon N. Patten in
The New Basis of Civilization, suggest the necessity for reading the
index in the United States and for heeding it.

PART II. READING THE INDEX TO HEALTH RIGHTS



CHAPTER VToC

MOUTH BREATHING


If the physical condition of school children is our best index to
community health, who is to read the index? Unless the story is told
in a language that does not require a secret code or cipher, unless
some one besides the physician can read it, we shall be a very long
time learning the health needs of even our largest cities, and until
doomsday learning the health needs of small towns and rural districts.
Fortunately the more important signs can be easily read by the average
parent or teacher. Fortunately, too, it is easy to persuade mothers
and teachers that they can lighten their own labors, add to their
efficiency, and help their children by being on the watch for mouth
breathing, for strained, crossed, or inflamed eyes, for decaying
teeth, for nervousness and sluggishness. Years ago, when I taught
school in a Minnesota village, I had never heard of adenoids,
hypertrophied tonsils, myopia, hypermetropia, or the relation of these
defects and of neglected teeth to malnutrition, truancy, sickness, and
dullness. I now see how I could have saved myself several failures,
the taxpayers a great deal of money, the parents a great deal of
disappointment, and many children a life of inefficiency, had I known
what it is easy for all teachers and parents to learn to-day.

[46]


MOUTH BREATHERS BEFORE "ADENOID PARTY"


The features in the following cut are familiar to teachers the world
over. Parents may reconcile themselves to such lips, eyes, and mouths,
but seldom do even neglectful parents fail to notice "mouth
breathing." Children afflicted by such features suffer torment from
playfellows whose scornful epithets are echoed by the looking-glass.
No fashion plate ever portrays such faces. No athlete, thinker, or
hero looks out from printed page with such clouded, listless eyes. The
more wonder, therefore, that the meaning of these outward signs has
not been appreciated and their causes removed; conclusive reason,
also, for not being misled by recent talk of mouth breathing,
adenoids, and enlarged tonsils, into the belief that the race is
physically deteriorating. Three generations ago Charles Dickens in his
Uncommercial Traveller pointed out a relation between open mouths
and backwardness and delinquency that would have saved millions of
dollars and millions of life failures had the civilized world
listened. He was speaking of delinquent girls from seventeen to twenty
years old in Wapping Workhouse: "I have never [47]yet ascertained why a
refractory habit should affect the tonsils and the uvula; but I have
always observed that refractories of both sexes and every grade,
between a Ragged School and the Old Bailey, have one voice, in which
the tonsils and uvula gain a diseased ascendency."

To-day we are just beginning to see over again the connection between
inability to breathe through the nose and inability to see clearly
right from wrong and inability to want to do what teachers and parents
wish. Physical examinations show now, and might just as well have
shown fifty years ago, that the great majority of truants and juvenile
offenders have adenoids and enlarged tonsils. A recent examination
made by the New York board of health on 150 children in one school
made up from the truant school, the juvenile court, and Randall's
Island, showed that only three were without some physical defect and
that 137 had adenoids and large tonsils. Dickens wrote his
observations in 1860; in 1854 the New York Juvenile Asylum was
started, and up to 1908 cared for 40,000 children; in 1860 William
Meyer pointed out, so that no one need misunderstand, the harmful
effects of adenoids. What would have been the story of juvenile
waywardness, of sickness, of educational advancement, had examinations
for defective breathing been started in 1853 or 1860 instead of 1905;
if one per cent of the attention that has been given to teaching mouth
breathers the ten commandments had been spent on removing the nasal
obstructions to intelligence?




A "DEGENERATE" MADE NORMAL BY REMOVAL OF ADENOIDS


William Hegel, who is pictured on page 48, before his tonsils and
adenoids were removed was described by his father in this way: "When
playing with other boys on the street he seems dazed, and sluggish to
grasp the various situations occurring in the course of the game. When
he decides to do something he runs in a heedless, senseless way, as if
running away,       will bump against something, [48]pedestrian or building,
before he comes to himself; seems dazed all the time. When told
something by his mother he giggles in the most exasperating way, for
which he receives a whipping quite often." The father said the
whipping was of no avail. The child was restless, talkative, and
snored during sleep. He had an insatiable appetite. He was removed or
transferred from five different schools in New York City. To get
redress the father took him to the board of education, whence he was
referred to the assistant chief medical inspector of the department of
health, whose examination revealed immensely large fungous-looking
tonsils and excessive pharyngeal granulations (adenoids). He was
operated on at a clinic. The tonsils and adenoids removed are pictured
on the opposite page, reduced one third. After the operation the child
was visited by the assistant medical inspector. There was a marked
improvement in his facial expression,       he looked intelligent, was
alert and interested. When [49]asked how he felt, he answered, "I feel
fine now." It required about fifteen minutes to get his history,
during all of which time he was responsive and interested, constantly
correcting statements of his father and volunteering other
information. Eleven days after the operation he was reported to have
had no more epileptic seizures. "Doesn't talk in sleep. Doesn't snore.
Doesn't toss about the bed. Has more self-control. Tries to read the
paper. His immoderate appetite is not present."




REASON ENOUGH FOR MOUTH BREATHINGAdenoid and tonsils reduced one third


While the open mouth is a sure sign of defects of breathing, it is not
true that the closed mouth, when awake and with other people, is proof
that there are no such defects. Children breathe through the mouth not
because they like to, not because they have drifted into bad habits,
not [50]because their parents did, not because the human race is
deteriorating, but because their noses are stopped up,       because they
must. A mouth breather is not only always taking unfiltered dirt germs
into his system but is always in the condition of a person who has
slept in a stuffy room. What extra effort adenoids mean can be
ascertained by closing the nostrils for a forenoon.

For many reasons it is perhaps unfortunate that we can breathe at all
when the nose is stopped up. If we could see with our ears as well as
with our eyes, we should probably not take as good care of our eyes.
In this respect the whole race has experienced the misfortune of the
man of whom the coroner reported, "Killed by falling too short a
distance." Because we can breathe through the mouth we have neglected
for centuries the nasal passages. When a cold stops the nose we
necessarily breathe through the mouth. Unfortunately children make the
necessary effort required to breathe through the nose long before
other people notice the lines along the nose and the slow mind. Mouth
breathing will show with the child asleep, before the child awake
loses power to accommodate his effort to the task. Therefore the
importance of a physical test at school to detect the beginnings of
adenoids and large tonsils before these symptoms become obvious to
others.

No child should be exempted from this examination because of
apocryphal theories that only the poor, the slum child, the
refractory, or the unclean have defects in breathing. This very
afternoon a friend has told me of her year abroad with a girl of nine,
whose parents are very wealthy. The girl is an       mic. Her backwardness
humiliates her parents, especially because she gave great promise
until two years ago. High-priced physicians have prescribed for her.
It happens that they are too eminent to give attention to such simple
troubles as adenoids that [51]can be felt and seen. They are looking for
complications of the liver or inflammation of muscles at the base of
the brain. One celebrated French savant found the adenoids, assured
the mother that the child would outgrow them, and advised merely that
she be compelled to breathe through the nose. The mother and
nursemaids nag the child all day. The poor unwise mother sits up
nights to hold the child's jaws tight in the hope that air coming
through the nose will absorb the adenoids. The mother is made nervous.
Of course this makes the child more nervous and adds to the evil
effects of adenoids. If the mother had the good fortune to be very
poor, she could not sit up nights, and would long ago have decided
either to let the child alone or else to have the trouble removed.

Adenoids are not a city specialty. Country earache is largely due to
adenoids or to inflammation that quickly leads to adenoids. In 415
villages of New York state twelve per cent were found to be mouth
breathers. For two summers I have known a lad named Fred. He lives at
the seashore. Throughout his twelve years he has lived in a veritable
El Dorado of health and nature beauty. Groves and dunes and flora vie
with the blues of ocean and sky in resting the eye and in filling the
soul with that harmony which is said to make for sound living. Yet to
a child, Fred's schoolmates are experts on patent medicines and on the
heredity that is alleged to be responsible for bad temper, running
sores, tuberculosis, an       mia, and weak eyes. Freddie is particularly
favored. His well-to-do parents have supplied him with ponies, games,
and bicycles. Nothing prevents his breathing salt air fresh from the
north pole but hermetically sealed windows. The father thinks it
absurd to make a fuss over adenoids. Didn't he have them when a boy,
and doesn't he weigh two hundred pounds and "make good money"? The
mother never knew of operations for such trifles when [52]she taught
school; she supposes her boy needs an operation, but "just can't bear
to see the dear child hurt." As for Fred, he breathes through his
mouth, talks through his nose, grows indifferent to boy's fun, fails
to earn promotion at school, and fears that "I won't be strong in
spite of all the patent medicine I've taken." Father, mother, and Fred
feel profound pity for the city child living so far from nature.

Adenoids are not monopolized by children whose parents are ignorant of
the importance of them and of physical examination. Last summer I was
asked by a small boy to buy some chocolate. A glance at his cigar box
with its two or three uninviting things for sale showed that the boy
was really begging. He had thick lips, open mouth, "misty" eyes, and a
nasal twang. I asked him if his teacher had not told him he had lumps
back of his nose and could not breathe right. He said, "No." I
explained then that he could make a great deal more money if he talked
like other boys, stepped livelier, and breathed as other people
breathe. He said he had "been by a doctor onct but didn't want to be
op'rated." I turned to my companion and asked, "Have you never noted
those same lines on your boy's face?" Although he had been lecturing
on mouth breathers, he had never noticed his own boy's trouble. He
hastened home and found the infallible signs. The mother declared it
could not be true of her boy. About five months before, their family
physician had said of the child's earache, "The same inflammation of
the nasal passages that causes earache causes adenoids; you must be on
the lookout." Although in the country, the boy's appetite was not good
and his zest for play had flagged. They had looked for the trouble to
back generations and in psychology books,       everywhere but at the boy's
face, in his mouth, and in his nose. After the operation, which took
less than two minutes, the appetite was [53]ravenous, the eyes cleared,
and the spirit rebounded to its old buoyancy that craved worlds to
conquer.

The new personal experience made a deep impression upon my friend's
mind. He wanted everybody to know how easy it was to overlook a
child's distress. One person after another had a story to tell him;
even the janitor said: "You'd ought to have seen our John at sixteen.
He spent a week by the hospital." The only people who do not seem to
know more than the new convert are the mouth breathers whom he
religiously stops on the street.

The indexes to adenoids and large tonsils for the teacher to read at
school are:



1. Inability to breathe through the nose.

2. A chronically running nose, accompanied by frequent nose-bleeds
and a cough to clear the throat.

3. Stuffy speech and delayed learning to talk. "Common" is
pronounced "cobb        d"; "nose," "dose"; and "song," "sogg."

4. A narrow upper jaw and irregular crowding of the teeth.

5. Deafness.

6. Chorea or nervousness.

7. Inflamed eyes and conjunctivitis.



The adenoids and large tonsils discovered at school are an index:



1. To children needlessly handicapped in school work.

2. To teachers needlessly burdened.

3. To whole classes held back by afflicted children.

4. To breeding grounds for disease.

5. To homes where children's diseases and tuberculosis are most
likely to break out and flourish.

6. To parents who need instruction in their duty to their
children, to themselves, and to their neighbors, and who are
ignorant of the way in which "catching" diseases originate and
spread.



The riot that occurred when the adenoids of children in a school on
the "East Side" in New York City were [54]removed without the preliminary
of convincing the parents as to the advantages of the operation was
merely a demand for the "right to knowledge," which is never
overlooked with impunity. Reluctance to permit operation on a young
child, and the natural shrinking of a parent at seeing a child under
the surgeon's knife, require the teacher or school physician or nurse
to answer fully the usual questions of the hesitant mother and father.

1. Is the operation necessary? Will the child not outgrow its
adenoids? Usually the adenoid growths atrophy or dry up after the age
of puberty. Adenoids are not uncommon in adults, however. The surgeon
general of the army reports that during the year 1905, out of 3004
operations on officers and enlisted men in service, there were 225
operations on the nose, mouth, and pharynx, 103 of which were
operations for adenoids and enlarged or hypertrophied tonsils.
Allowing the child to "outgrow" adenoids may mean not only that he is
being subjected to infection chronically but that his body is allowed
to be permanently deformed and his health endangered. Beginning at the
age of the second dentition, the bones of jaw, nose, throat, and chest
are undergoing important changes       nasal occlusion. Adenoids left to
atrophy       if large enough to cause mouth breathing       may mean atrophy of
this developing process, permanent disfiguration of face, and
permanent deformity of chest and lungs.

2. Will the growth recur? In a few cases it does recur; frequently
either because it was not desirable to make a complete removal of the
adenoid tissue or because the surgeon was careless. If the growths do
recur, then they must be removed again.

3. Is the operation a dangerous one?

4. Is an an       sthetic necessary?

5. Will the operation cure the child of all its troubles? These
questions are best answered by the process and [55]results of an "adenoid
party," which was given especially for the benefit of this book, every
step and symptom of which were carefully studied.

The seven children pictured here were discovered by their school
physician to have moderately large adenoid growths,       one boy having
enlarged tonsils also.




MOUTH BREATHERS IMMEDIATELY AFTER "ADENOID PARTY"


The picture on page 46 was taken by flash light at 2.30 P.M.,
January 15, 1908. At 3 P.M. the principal escorted these
children into the operating room at Vanderbilt Clinic. The doctor
examined the throat and nose of each child, entered the name and age
of each, together with his diagnosis, on a clinic card, sending each
child into the next room after examination. He then called the first
boy and explained that it would hurt, but that it would be over in a
minute. The principal stood by and told him to be brave and remember
the five cents he could have for ice cream afterwards. The clinic
nurse tied a large towel about him and put him in her lap; with one
hand she held his clasped hands, while the other held his head back.
The doctor then took the little instrument       the curette       and pushed it
up back of the soft palate, and with one twist [56]brought out the
offending spongy lump. The boy's head was immediately held over a
basin of running water. He was so occupied with spitting out the blood
that rushed down to choke him that he hadn't time to cry before the
acute pain had ceased. The rush of cool air through his nostrils was
such a pleasurable sensation that he smiled as the school nurse
escorted him out into the hall to wait for his companions. At 3.30
P.M. all seven children were out in the hall, all seven
mouths were closed, and all seven faces were clothed with the sleepy,
peaceful expression that comes with rest from the prolonged labor of
trying to get enough air. At 3.45 P.M. they had been all
re      xamined by the doctor, and a few tag ends were picked out of the
nasopharynx of one child. At 4 P.M. the "party" had returned
to the Children's Aid Society's school and to the ice cream that
follows each adenoid party.

It is worth while to tell mothers stories of the "marvelous
improvement in school progress of those children whose brains have
been poisoned and starved by the accursed adenoid growths, and how
their bodies fairly bloom when the mysterious and awful incubus is
removed," to use the words of one school principal. It is worth while
to show them "before" and "after" pictures, and "before" and "after"
children, and "before" and "after" school marks.

CHAPTER VIToC

CATCHING DISEASES, COLDS, DISEASED GLANDS


Deadly fevers, the plague, black death, cholera, malaria, smallpox,
taught mankind invaluable lessons. Millions of human beings died
before the mind of man devoted itself to preventing the diseases for
which no sure cure had been found. Efforts to conquer these diseases
were tardy because men were taught that some unseen power was
punishing men and governments for their sins. The difference between
the old and the new way is shown powerfully by a painting in the
Liverpool Gallery entitled "The Plague." A medi       val village is strewn
with the dead and dying. Bloated, spotted faces look into the eyes of
ghouls as laces and jewelry are torn from bodies not yet cold. In the
foreground a muscular giant, paragon of conscious virtue, clad like
John the Baptist and Bible in hand, finds his way among his
plague-stricken fellow-townsmen, urging them to turn from their sins.
Modern efficiency learns of the first outbreak of the plague, isolates
the patient, kills rats and their fleas which spread the disease,
thoroughly cleanses or destroys, if necessary, all infected clothing,
bedding, floors, and walls, and makes it possible for us to go on
living for each other with a better chance of "bringing forth fruits
worthy for repentance."

Where boards of health make it compulsory to report cases of sickness
due to contagion, health records are a reliable index to "catching"
diseases. But now that the chief infection is the kind that afflicts
children, we can read the index before the outbreak that calls in a
physician to diagnose the case. School examination shows which
[58]children have defects that welcome and encourage disease germs. It
points to homes that cultivate germs, and consequently menace other
homes. To locate children who have enlarged tonsils may prevent a
diphtheria epidemic. To detect in September those who are
undernourished, who have bad teeth, and who breathe through the mouth
will help forecast winter's outbreaks of scarlet fever and measles.
One dollar spent at this season in examination for soil hospitable to
disease germs may save fifty dollars otherwise necessary for
inspection and cure of contagious diseases.

It is harder at first to interest a community in medical examination
than in medical inspection, because we are all afraid of "catching"
diseases, while few of us know how they originate and how they can be
prevented by correcting the unfavorable conditions which physical
examination of school children will bring to light.

Courses in germ sociology are therefore of prime necessity. How do
germs act? On what do they live? Why do they move from place to place?
What causes them to become extinct? With few exceptions, germs migrate
for the same reason as man,       search for food, love of conquest, and
love of adventure. When there is plenty of food they multiply rapidly.
Full of life, overflowing with vitality, they move out for new worlds
to conquer. Like human beings, they will do their best to get away
from a country that provides a scanty food supply. Like men and women,
they starve if they cannot eat. Like boys and girls, they avoid
enemies; the weak give way to the strong, the slow to the swift, the
devitalized to the vitalized.

Human sociology imprisons, puts to death, deprives of opportunity to
do evil, or reforms those who murder, steal, or slander. Germ
sociology teaches us to do the same with injurious germs. We imprison
them, we take away their food supply, we kill them outright, or we
starve them slowly. They have a peculiar diet, being especially
[59]partial to decomposing vegetable and animal matter and to what human
beings call dirt. By putting this diet out of their reach we make it
impossible for them to propagate their kind. By placing poison within
their reach or by forcing it upon them we can successfully eliminate
them as enemies. As the president of Mexico restored order "by setting
a thief to catch a thief," so modern science is setting germs to kill
germs that harm crops and human stock. Of utmost consequence is it
that the body's germ consumer       its pretorian guard       be always armed
with vitality ready to vanquish every intruding hostile germ. If we
are false to our guard, it will turn traitor and join invaders in
attacking us. But here, as in dealing with evils that originate with
human beings, an ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure. The most
effectual way to eliminate germ diseases is to remove the cause       the
food supply of disease germs. The fact that many germs are plants, not
animals, does not weaken the analogy, for weeds do not get a chance in
well-tilled soil.

Perhaps the most notable recent example of government germ
extermination is the triumph over the yellow-fever and malaria
mosquito in Panama. When the French started to build a canal in
Panama, the first thing they did was to build a hospital. The hospital
was always full and the canal was given up. At the time the United
States proposed to re-attempt the work, it was thought that it could
not be done without great loss of life and without great labor
difficulties. Instead of taking the sickness for granted and enlarging
the French hospital, the chief medical inspector, Gorgas, took for
granted that there need be no unusual sickness if proper preventive
measures were taken. He knew what the French had not known, that the
yellow-fever scourge depends for its terrors upon mosquitoes.
Accordingly, with the aid of six thousand men and five million dollars
he set about to starve [60]out the few infected and infectious kinds of
mosquito,       the yellow-fever or house mosquito and the malaria or
meadow mosquito. He introduced waterworks and hydrants, paved the
streets, drained the swamps and pools in which they breed, and
instituted a weekly house-to-house inspection to prevent even so much
as a pail of stagnant water offering harbor to these enemies. The
grass of the meadows where the malaria mosquito breeds was cut short
and kept short within three hundred feet of dwellers,       as far as the
mosquito can fly. All ditches were disinfected with paraffin, and the
natives were forced to observe sanitary laws. President Roosevelt, in
his special message to Congress on the Panama Canal in 1906, stated
that in the weekly house-to-house visit of the inspectors at the time
he was in Panama but two mosquitoes were found. These were not of the
dangerous type. As a consequence of this sanitary engineering there is
very little sickness in Panama, the hospital is seldom one third full,
and the canal is progressing very much faster than was expected.
Panama, like Havana, is now safer than many American cities, because
cleaner and less hospitable to disease germs.

Any place where numbers of people are accustomed to assemble favors
the propagation of germs,       whether it be the meetinghouse, the
townhall, the theater, or the school. Every teacher can be the
sanitary engineer of her own schoolroom, school, or community by
co      perating with the school doctor, the town board of health, family
physicians, and mothers. Every teacher can exterminate disease by
applying the very same principles to her schoolroom as Chief Medical
Inspector Gorgas applied to Panama. Knowledge, disinfection, absolute
cleanliness, education, and inspection are the essential steps. First
she must know that "children's diseases" are not necessary. She should
discountenance the old superstition that every child [61]must run the
gamut of children's diseases, that every child must sooner or later
have whooping cough, measles, chicken pox, mumps, scarlet fever, just
as they used to think yellow fever and cholera inevitable. The price
of this terrible ignorance has been not only expense, loss of time,
acquisition of permanent physical defects, and loss of vitality, but,
for the majority of children, death before reaching five years of age.
All these "catching" diseases are germ diseases, which disinfection
can eliminate. The free use of strong yellow soap and disinfectants on
the school floor, windows, benches, desks, blackboards, pencils, in
the coat closets and toilets, plus the natural disinfectants, hot sun
and oxygen, will prevent the schoolroom from being a source of danger.
One or more of these germ-killing remedies must be constantly applied;
cleansing deserves a larger part in every school budget.

Often country towns are as ignorant of the existence of germs and of
the means of preventing the spread of disease as the woman in a small
country town who used daily to astound the neighbors by the "shower of
snow" she produced by shaking the bedding of her sick child out of the
window. Their astonishment was soon changed to panic when that shower
of snow resulted in a deadly epidemic of scarlet fever. Medical
inspection of New York City's schools was begun after an epidemic of
scarlet fever was traced to a popular boy who passed around among his
schoolmates long rolls of skin from his fingers.

Much of the care exercised at school to prevent children's diseases is
counteracted because children are exposed at home and in public places
to contagion, where ignorance more often than carelessness is the
cause of uncleanliness. By hygiene lessons, illustrating practically
the proper methods of cleaning a room, much may be done to enlist
school children in the battle against germs. Through the enthusiasm of
the children as well as through [62]visits to the homes parents may be
instructed as to the danger of letting well children sleep with sick
children; the wisdom of vaccination to prevent smallpox, of antitoxin
to prevent serious diphtheria, of tuberculin tests to settle the
question whether tuberculosis is present; why anything that gathers
dust is dangerous unless cleansed and aired properly; and why bedding,
furniture, floor coverings, and curtains that can be cleansed and
aired are more beautiful and more safe than carpets, feather beds,
upholstery, and curtains that are spoiled by water and sunshine; how
to care for the tuberculous member of the family, etc. Anti-social
acts may be prevented, such as carrying an infected child to the
doctor in a public conveyance, thereby infecting numberless other
people; sending infected linen to a common laundry; mailing a letter
written by an infected person without first disinfecting it; sending a
child with diphtheria to the store; returning to the dairy unscalded
milk bottles from a sick room.

The daily inspection of school children for contagious diseases by the
school physician has, where tried, been found to reduce considerably
the amount of sickness in a town. Such inspection should be
universally adopted. Moreover, the teacher should be conversant with
the early symptoms of these diseases so that on the slightest
suspicion the child may be sent home without waiting for the
physician's call. Like the little girl who never stuttered except when
she talked, school children and school-teachers are rarely frightened
until too late to prevent trouble. The "easy" diseases such as
measles, whooping cough, etc., cost our communities more than the more
terrible diseases like typhoid and smallpox. During one typical week
ending May 18, 630 new cases of measles were reported to one
department of health. Obviously the nineteen deaths reported give no
conception of the suffering, the cost, the anxiety caused by this
preventable disease. The same [63]may be said of diphtheria and croup, of
which only thirty-two deaths are reported, but 306 cases of sickness.
Yet no one to-day will send a child to sleep with a playmate so as to
catch diphtheria and "be done with it."

The most strategic point of attack is almost universally unrecognized.
That is the child's mouth. Here the germs find lodgment, here they
find a culture medium       at the gateway of the human system. The mouth
is never out of service and is almost never in a state of true
cleanliness. Solid particles from the breath, saliva, food between the
teeth, and other d        bris form a deposit on the teeth and decompose in a
constant temperature of ninety-eight degrees Fahrenheit. In the normal
mouth from eight to twenty years of age the teeth present from twenty
to thirty square inches of dentate surface, constantly exposed to
ever-changing, often inimical, conditions. This bacterially infected
surface makes a fairly large garden plot. Every cavity adds to the
germ-nourishing soil. Dental caries       tooth decay       is a disease
hitherto almost universal from birth to death. Thus the air taken in
through the mouth becomes a purveyor of its poisonous emanations and
affects the lung tissues and the blood. Food and water carry hostile
germs down into the stomach. Thence they may be carried into any organ
or tissue, just as nourishment or poison is carried.

Moreover, the child with an unclean mouth not only infects and
reinfects himself but scatters germs in the air whenever he sneezes or
coughs. In a cold apartment where there is no appreciable current of
air a person can scatter germs for a distance of more than twenty-two
feet. Germs are also scattered through the air by means of salivary or
mucous droplets. It is this fact that makes colds so dangerous.

  DISEASE
  PRINCIPAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
  Method of Infection
  REMARKS
  
  
  Measles
  Begins like cold in the head, with
    feverishness, running nose, inflamed and watery eyes, and sneezing; small crescentic groups of
    mulberry-tinted spots appear about the third day; rash first seen on forehead and face.
    The rash varies with heat; may almost disappear if the air is cold, and come out again with warmth.
  Breath and discharges from nose and mouth.
  After effects often severe. Period of greatest
    risk of infection first three or four days, before the rash appears. May have repeated attacks. Great
    variation in type of disease.
  
  
  German Measles
  Illness usually slight. Onset
    sudden. Rash often first thing noticed; no cold in head. Usually have feverishness and
    sore throat, and the eyes may be inflamed. Rash something between Measles and Scarlet
    Fever, variable.
  Breath and discharges from nose
    and mouth
  After effects slight.
  
  
  Chicken Pox
  Sometimes begins with feverishness,
    but is usually very mild and without sign of fever. Rash appears on second day as small pimples,
    which in about a day become filled with clear fluid. This fluid then becomes matter, and then the spot
    dries upand the crust falls off.
    May have successive crops of of rash until tenth day.
  Breath and crust of spots.
  When children return, examine head for
    overlooked spots. All spots should have disappeared before child returns. A mild disease and seldom any after
    effects.
  
  
  Whooping Cough
  Begins like cold in the
    head, with bronchitis and sore throat, and a cough which is worse at night.
    Symptoms may at first be very mild. Characteristic "whooping" cough develops in about a fortnight,
    and the spasm of coughing often ends with vomiting.
  Breath and discharges
    from nose and mouth.
  After effects often very severe
    and the disease causes great debility. Relapses are apt to occur. Second attack rare. Specially infectious for
    first week or two. If a child is sick after a bout of coughing, it is most probably suffering from whooping cough.
    Great variation in type of disease.
  
  
  Mumps
  Onset may be sudden, beginning
    with sickness and fever, and pain about the angle of the jaw. The glands become swollen and
    tender, and the jaws stiff, and the saliva sticky.
  Breath and discharges from nose
    and mouth.
  Seldom leaves after effects.
    Very infectious.
  
  
  Scarlet
    Fever or Scarlatina[65]
  The onset is usually
    sudden, with headache, languor, feverishness, sore throat, and often the child is sick.
    Usually within twenty-four hours the rash appears, and is finely spotted, evenly diffused,
    and bright red. The rash is seen first on the neck and upper part of chest, and
    lasts three to ten days, when it fades and the skin peels in scales, flakes, or even large
    pieces. The tongue becomes whitish, with bright red spots. The eyes are not watery or congested.
  Breath, discharges from nose
    and mouth, particles of skin, and discharges from suppuratory glands or ears. Milk specially apt to
    convey infection.
  Dangerous both during attack
    and from after effects. Great variation in type of disease. Slight attacks as infectious as severe ones.
    Many mild cases not diagnosed and many concealed. The peeling may last six to eight weeks. A second attack
    is rare. When scarlet fever is occurring in a school, all cases of sore throat should be sent home.
  
  
  Diphtheria
  Onset insidious, may be rapid
    or gradual. Typically sore throat, great weakness, and swelling of glands in the neck, about the
    angle of the jaw. The back of the throat, tonsils, or palate may show patches like pieces of
    yellowish-white kid. The most pronounced symptom is great debility and lassitude, and there may be little
    else noticeable. There may be hardly any symptoms at all.
  Breath and discharges
    from nose, mouth, and ears.
  Very dangerous both during
    attack and from after effects. When diphtheria is occurring in a school all children suffering from sore
    throat should be excluded. There is great variation of type, and mild cases are often not recognized
    but are as infectious as severe cases. There is no immunity from further attacks. Fact of existence
    of disease sometimes concealed.
  
  
  Influenza
  Begins with feverishness,
    pain in head, back, and limbs, and usually cold in the head.
  Breath and discharges
    from nose and mouth.
  Excessively infectious. After
    effects often very serious and accompanied with great prostration and nervous debility.
  
  
  Smallpox
  The illness is usually well
    marked and the onset rather sudden, with feverishness, severe backache, and sickness. About third
    day a red rash of shotlike pimples, felt below the skin, and seen first about the face
    and wrists. Spots develop in two days, then form little blisters, and in other two
    days become yellowish and filled with matter. Scabs then form, and these fall off about
    the fourteenth day.
  Breath, all discharges,
    and particles of skin or scabs.
  Peculiarly infectious. When
    smallpox occurs in connection with a school or with any of the children's homes, an endeavor
    should be made to have all persons over seven years of age revaccinated.  Cases of modified
    smallpox       in vaccinated persons       may be, and often are, so slight as to escape detection.
    Fact of existence of disease may be concealed. Mild or modified infectious as severe type.
  



In the following diseases only the affected child is excluded



  
  Erysipelas. Child should not return till all swelling and
     peeling of skin has disappeared.
  Ringworm on Scalp. Child should be excluded till cured. Very
    difficult to cure and often takes a very long time.
  
  
  Ophthalmia. Child should not return till all traces have disappeared.
  Phthisis (Consumption). If in advanced stage and coughing much
    or spitting, child should be excluded. (Infection from breath and dried spit floating in the
    air as dust.)
  
  
  Scabies or Itch. Child should be excluded until cured.
  
  
  Ringworm on Skin. Child should be excluded till cured. This takes
    only a few days if properly treated.
  Impetigo (Contagious Sore). Child should be excluded until
    cured. A week or ten days should suffice.

[66]Most people still think that colds are due to cold air or draughts
rather than to a cold germ, which finds a body unequipped with
resisting power, with its germ police off guard, exhausted from
overwork, or disaffected and ready to turn traitor if the enemy seems
stronger than our vitality. Sometimes it seems as if we contracted it
from a sneezing fellow-passenger, sometimes from a draught from an
open car window. An uninformed opponent of the theory that colds are a
germ disease wrote the following letter last winter to a New York
newspaper:

In addition to the Society for the Suppression of Noises there
should be in this town a Society for the Suppression of
"Fresh-Air" Fiends. The newspapers report an epidemic of
pneumonia, grippe, and colds. It is almost entirely due to the
fact that the average New Yorker is compelled to live, move, and
have his being from daylight to midnight in a succession of
draughts of cold air caused by the insanity of overfed male and
female hogs, who, with blood almost bursting through their skins,
demand "fresh air" in order to keep from suffocating. Everywhere a
man goes, day or night, he is in a draught caused by the crazy
ideas about fresh air.

Our wise ancestors, who as a rule lived much longer than we do,
and had much better health, said:


"If the wind should blow through a hole,
God have mercy on your soul."


After the correspondent has learned that our ancestors had more colds
than we, had poorer health, and died twenty years younger, perhaps he
will listen to proof that his unclean warm air weakens the body and
makes it an easy prey to cold germs.

Many physicians preach and practice this fallacy as to fresh air and
colds, but few physicians now deny that influenza is a germ disease or
that a nose so irritated and so neglected as to secrete large
quantities of mucus is a better place for breeding disease germs than
a nose whose membranes are clean and not thus irritated.

[67]Until medical specialists are agreed, and until they have definitely
located the cold germ, we laymen must choose for ourselves a working
theory. The weight of opinion at the present time declares that colds
are due to germs. Strong membranes with good circulation and drainage
provide poor food for germs. Congested membranes furnish proper
conditions for propagation. The germ theory explains the spread of
germs from the nose to the passages of the head, and from head to
arteries and lungs.

A cold can always be charged to some one else. How many can be laid to
our account? There is one right that is universally not recognized,
and that is the right of protection from the germs showered in the air
we breathe, over the food we eat, by the sneezes of our unfortunate
neighbor at school, in the street car, at the restaurant. The chief
danger of a cold is to our neighbor, not to ourselves. A cold which a
strong person may throw off in a day or two may mean death to his
tuberculous neighbor. Though for our own health "lying up for a mere
cold" is an unnecessary bore, the failure to do so may deprive our
neighbor of a right greater than the right to protection against
scarlet fever or smallpox. Though formerly this statement would [68]not
have been true, rights change with conditions, and the fact that
to-day the three most deadly diseases are pneumonia, tuberculosis, and
diphtheria,       all diseases of the respiratory organs,       justifies the
assertion that we have a right to protection against colds. The
prevalence of colds, sore throats, irritated vocal cords, bad voices,
catarrh, bronchitis, laryngitis, and asthma in America to-day demands
summary measures. One can learn to sneeze into a handkerchief, not
into a companion's face or into a room. School children can be taught
to avoid handkerchiefs on which mucus has dried. In the far distant
future we may be willing to use cheesecloth, and boil it or throw it
away, or, like the Japanese, use soft paper handkerchiefs and burn
them after using.

One child with a cold can infect a whole class or family, thus
depriving the class and family of the top of their vitality and
efficiency without their consent. Because a person is thought a
weakling who lies up for a "mere cold," one is inclined to wish that
colds were as prostrating as typhoid, in which case there would be
some hope of their extermination.

The exclusion of children with colds from school deserves trial as a
check to children's diseases. Many of these "catching" diseases start
with a cold in the head, as, for instance, measles, influenza, and
whooping cough. The first symptom of mumps, diphtheria, and scarlet
fever is a sore throat or swollen glands, which, because they commonly
accompany a cold, are not at first distinguished from it.

The first step for the teacher or mother in reading the index for
colds is to look into the coat closet for evidence of warm clothing
and overshoes, then to note whether the children put them on when they
go out for lunch or recess. Whether "cold" settles in the nasal
passages, ear, or stomach depends upon which is the weak spot.
Draughts, [69]thin soles, wet soles, exposure when perspiring, may be the
immediate cause of the nutritional or respiratory disturbances that
give cold germs a foothold. Adenoids, diseased teeth, inflamed ears,
may furnish the food supply. "There is no use treating children and
sending them on fresh-air trips as long as they have nutritional and
digestive disturbances due to bad teeth, or colds due to adenoids,"
said a physician when examining a party of children for a summer
outing. The great preventive measure to be taken for catching
diseases, colds, diseased glands,       in fact all germ diseases,       is the
repeated cleansing of those portions of the human body in which germs
may find lodgment,       the mouth, the nose, the eyes, and the ears.

In caring for young infants great pains is taken to cleanse all the
orifices daily, but as soon as the child washes himself this practice
is usually abandoned. Washing these gateways is far more important
than washing the surface of the body through which germs could not
possibly gain entrance into the system except through wounds.
Oftentimes the douching of the nostrils with salt water will stop a
cold at once. The mouth is the most important place of all, and the
teacher should take care of her pupils' mouths first and foremost. As
bad teeth, enlarged tonsils, and adenoids harbor germs and putrescent
matter that vitiate every incoming and outgoing breath, these defects
should be immediately corrected. Are we coming to a time when a
thorough house-cleaning in the mouth of every child will take place
before he enters the schoolroom, preferably in the presence of the
teacher?

Two other "catching" diseases cause city schools a great deal of
trouble,       trachoma and pediculosis (head lice). There are probably no
two diseases more quickly transmitted from one person to another.
Almost before their presence is known, all children of a school or
all [70]persons of a group have contracted them. When at college twenty
men of my fraternity discovered almost at the same time that they had
an infectious eye trouble; yet we thought we were using different
towels and otherwise taking sanitary precautions. Last summer a Vassar
graduate took a party of tenement children for a country picnic. She
returned with head lice that required constant attention for weeks.
What then may we expect of children who live in homes where there is
neither water, time, nor privacy for bathing, where one towel must
serve a family of six, where mothers work for wages away from home and
see their children only before seven and after six?

Unfortunately for thousands of children, many parents still believe
these troubles will be outgrown. Last summer a fresh-air agency in New
York City arranged for several hundred school girls to go to a certain
camp for ten days each. The only condition was that the heads should
be free from lice and nits (eggs). From the list furnished by
school-teachers       girls supposed to have been cured by school
nurses       not one in five was accepted. A baby two weeks old, brought to
Caroline Rest, had already begun to suffer from this easily
preventable scourge. Of 1219 children examined in Edinburgh, Scotland,
909, or 69 per cent, had some skin disease, and 60 per cent had sores
due to head lice. Even when neglect has caused the loss of hair and
ugly sores on the head, mothers deceive themselves into believing that
some other cause is responsible.

Trachoma, if neglected, not only impairs the health of the eye, but
may cause blindness. Tears carry the germs from the eye to the face,
where they are taken up on handkerchiefs, towels, and fingers and
infect other eyes. Of late, thanks to school nurses and physicians and
hygiene instruction, American cities have found relatively little
trachoma except among recent immigrants. So dangerous is the germ and
so insidious its methods of propagation, [71]that a physician should be
summoned at once at the first sign of inflammation. Conjunctivitis is
due to a germ, and will spread unless checked. Since the board of
health of New York City has instituted the systematic examination of
the eyes of the children in the public schools, it has found fully one
third affected with some form of conjunctivitis. Many of these cases
are out-and-out trachoma, others acute conjunctivitis, and a larger
proportion are "mild trachoma." This last form of the disease is found
to a great extent among children who have adenoids. The adenoids
should be regarded as a predisposing factor rather than a direct
cause. Therefore sore eyes are given as one of the indexes of
adenoids. When we consider that adenoids are made up of lymphoid
material, and that trachoma follicles are made up of the same sort of
tissue, it is not surprising that the two conditions are found in the
same child. The catarrhal inflammation produced by adenoids in the
nasal mucous membrane travels up the lachrymal duct and thus infects
the conjunctiva by contiguity.

In preventing pediculosis and infection of the eye vigilance and
cleanliness are indispensable. After the diseases are advanced, after
the germ colonies have taken title, some antiseptic or germ killer
more violent than water is needed,       kerosene for the hair or strong
green oil soap; for the eye, only what a physician prescribes.






[72]

CHAPTER VIIToC

EYE STRAIN


Wherever school children's eyes have been examined, from six to nine
out of thirty are found to be nearsighted, farsighted, or otherwise in
need of attention. A child is dismissed from school for obstinately
declaring that the letter between c and t in "cat" is an o; "a
pupil in her fourth school year was recently brought to me by her
teacher with the statement that she did unreasonably poor work in
reading for an intelligent and willing child;" a boy is punished for
being backward. These three cases are typical. Examinations showed
that the first child was astigmatic and not obstinate; the boy had run
a pin into one eye ten years before and destroyed its sight; while the
second girl was found to be afflicted with diplopia, and in a friendly
chat told the following story: "I very often see two words where there
is only one. When I was a very little girl I used to write every word
twice. Then I was scolded for being careless. So I learned that I
must not say two words even when I saw them." As Miss Alida S.
Williams, principal of Public School 33 in New York City, has in many
articles and addresses freely illustrated from school experience, the
art of seeing is acquired, not congenital, and every human being who
possesses it has learned it.

The large proportion of children suffering more or less seriously from
eye trouble has led many persons to suggest physical deterioration as
the cause. Eye specialists, however, assure us that eye troubles are
probably as old as man. Our tardiness in learning the facts regarding
these [73]troubles is due in part to the lack, until recently, of
instruments for examining the eye and for manufacturing glasses to
correct eye defects; in part, also, to the tendency of the medical
profession, which I shall repeatedly mention, to explain disorders by
causes remote and hard to find rather than by those near at hand.

About 1870 Dr. S. Weir Mitchell's attention was called "to the marked
relief of headache, insomnia, and other reflex symptoms following the
correction of optical defects by glasses." In 1874 and 1876 he wrote
two articles that "impressed upon the general profession the grave
significance of eye strain." Since that time, "in Philadelphia at
least, no study of the rebellious cause of headache or of the obscure
nervous diseases has ever been considered complete until a careful
examination of the eyes has included them as a possible cause of the
disturbance."

The new fact, therefore, is not weak eyes or strained eyes, but rather
(1) an increase in the regular misuse of eyes by school children,
seamstresses, stenographers, lawyers, etc.; and (2) the incipient
propaganda growing out of school tests that show the relation of eye
strain to headache, nervous diseases, stomach disorder, truancy,
backwardness.

Every school, private and parochial as well as public, should supply
itself with the Snellen card for testing eyes. Employers would do well
to have these cards in evidence also, for they may greatly increase
profits by decreasing inefficiency and risks. If there is no expert
optician near, apply for cards to your health board or school board;
failing there, write to your state health and school boards. In many
states rural teachers are already supplied with these cards by state
boards. In October, 1907, the New York state board of health sent out
cards, with instructions for their use, to 446 incorporated towns. The
state commissioner of education also sent a letter giving school
reasons for using the cards. Results from 415 schools having [74]shown
that nearly half the children had optical defects, it is proposed to
secure state legislation that will make eye tests obligatory in all
schools. Such a test in Massachusetts recently discovered twenty-two
per cent of the school children with defective vision, and from forty
to fifty thousand in need of immediate care by specialists.




POSITIONS OFTEN SUGGEST EYE STRAIN


Of course eye specialists,       oculists,       if skillful, know more about
eyes and eye troubles than general medical practitioners or teachers.
Preliminary eye tests, however, may be made by any accurate person who
can read. The Massachusetts state board of health reports that tests
made by teachers were "not less efficient" than tests made by
specialists. In June, 1907, a group of eminent oculists recommended to
the school board of New York [75]City that teachers make this first test
after being instructed by oculists. Persons interested in the schools
nearest them can quickly interest teachers and pupils by starting
tests with this card. In cities oculists can be found who will be glad
to explain to teachers, individually or in groups, how the cards
should be used and what dangers to avoid.

Nature intended the human eye to read the last line of this card at a
distance of ten feet. This conclusion is not a guess, but is based
upon the examination of thousands of eyes. In making the test, the
number of feet the eye ought to see is written as the denominator of
the fraction; the distance the eye can see clearly is the numerator.
If the child's card reads, "Right eye 10/10, left eye 10/20," it means
that the right eye sees without conscious strain the distance it is
intended to see, while the left eye must be within ten feet to see
what it ought to see twenty feet away.

The practical steps for a teacher to take in making eye tests are:

1. Scrutinize the faces for a strained or worried expression while
reading or writing, for squint eyes, for unnatural positions, and
for improper distances (more or less than nine inches) from eye to
book.

2. Select for first tests the children who obviously need
attention and will be obviously benefited. Use the eye test to
help trace the cause of headaches, nervousness, inattention.

3. Let the children mark off the distances with a foot rule and
chalk, going as high as twenty. Be sure to get the best light in
the room.

4. Start all children on the ten-foot line. If a child cannot read
at ten feet the letter which should be seen at that distance, move
the child forward, have it step forward and backward, and note the
result carefully. It is better to have ten separate letters of
exactly the right size and the same size than a row of letters on
one card, as in the Snellen test, otherwise memory will aid the
eye, or, as happened recently, a whole class may agree to feign
remarkable [76]nearsightedness or farsightedness by confusing letters
learned in advance from the card. If the Snellen card is used, and
if it is more convenient to have both child and card stationary,
satisfactory results will be obtained by having the child read
from large letters down as far as he can see.

5. Have the child read from right to left, from left to right, or
skip about so that memory cannot aid the eye.

6. Test each eye separately. I was twenty-five years old before I
learned that my left eye did practically all of the close sight
work. A grown woman discovered just a few days ago that she was
almost blind in the left eye; when she rubbed the right one while
reading she was shocked to find that she could see nothing with
the left eye.

7. If the card is stationary and the child moved, and if only one
size of the letter is used, put in the denominator the number of
feet at which the normal eye should see clearly, and in the
numerator the distance at which each eye and both together can
easily see. If the regular Snellen card is used containing letters
of different size, place in the denominator the number of the
lowest line each eye and both eyes together can read easily, and
in the numerator the number of feet from card to eye.

8. Explain the result to the child, to his fellows, to his
parents. If the left eye reads 10/20 and the right eye 10/30, it
means that neither eye is normal, and that reading small type is a
constant strain, even though unnoticed. The right eye must be
within ten feet to read what it should read at twenty feet. The
left eye must be within ten feet to read what it should read at
thirty feet. If the two eyes read at ten, it means that in working
together they successfully strain for a result that is not worth
what it is costing. When eyes thus unconsciously see what they are
not intended to see, it is only a matter of time when stomach and
nervous system will announce that the strain can no longer be
borne. Indigestion, dislike of study, restlessness follow. If,
however, the eyes are so near the normal that their story reads
12/10 or 8/10, the strain will be negligible for the present.
If, on the other hand, the only difficulty is a confusion of x
and z with c and g, it means that there is a strain due to
astigmatism, and that the child should be sent to an oculist.

[77]9. Teach children and parents (and practice what you preach) the
urgent importance of periodic re      xamination, just as you would
teach them to visit a dentist twice a year. This is needed by
those who wear eyeglasses, and more particularly by those who have
recently put them on. Moreover, as shown below, it is needed by
children able to pass satisfactorily the Snellen test.

10. Acquire the habit of reading the eye for evidence of temperate
or intemperate living, sleeping, eating, dancing, drinking, and
smoking. Inflamed eyes are results,       signals of danger. "The
organ may be faultless in construction and in its work poor,
because of nerve exhaustion, or, in a less and more easily
recoverable degree, nerve fatigue." If unusual eye conditions are
not readily explained by mode of living or by eye tests, an
oculist should be consulted.

The limits of the card test must be constantly kept in mind: (1) it
does not register eye sickness due to dust, smoke, or disease germs;
(2) it does not show unconscious eye strain due to successful
accommodation. But it will discover a great part of the children who
most need care. Sooner or later, too, inflammation of the eyelids, due
to external causes, will affect the nerves of the eye and their power
to conceal by accommodation the eye's defects. Just as we
unconsciously open the mouth when a cold stops up the nose, the eye
adapts itself to our needs without our realizing it. We expect it to
see. It sees. If our eyes are not made alike, they do their best to
work together. Like a good team of horses, the slow one hurries, the
fast one holds back a little. But if one eye is 10/15 and the other
10/10, they will both be unnatural and strained if both read the same
type. The effects of this strain frequently upset the stomach before
the eyes rebel. I learned that I needed eyeglasses after a case of
protracted indigestion, first diagnosed as "nervous" and later traced
to eyes. Thousands of upper-grade children and college students are
dieting for stomach trouble that will last until the eyes are relieved
of the undue and unrecognized strain. [78]To prove the influence of eye
strain on indigestion, persuade some obstinate parent to wear
improperly focused glasses for a day; she will then be willing to have
her child's eyes attended to.

It is unfortunate that the eyes will overwork without protesting. For
years many persons suffer without learning that their eyes are unlike,
or, as often happens, that one eye does all the close range work. Even
when being tested, eyes will seem to see easily what requires a great
effort of "accommodation." To prevent this self-deception skilled
oculists do not trust the eye card, but put a drug in the eye that
benumbs the muscles of accommodation. They cannot contract or expand
if they want to. The oculist then studies the length of the eye and
the muscle of accommodation. With this absolute knowledge of how each
eye is made he knows what is wrong, exactly at what angle light enters
the eye, whether objects are focused too soon or too late, exactly
what kind of eyeglasses or what operation upon the eye is needed to
enable it to do its work without undue straining or accommodation. So
unconsciously do the eyes accommodate themselves to the work expected
of them that not infrequently a child with seemingly perfect sight may
be more in need of glasses than the child with imperfect sight.
Practically, however, it is out of the question at the present time to
have the majority of children given a more thorough test than that
provided by the Snellen card. Where eye strains escape this test
teachers will find evidence in complaints of headache, nervousness,
sick stomach, chorea, or even epilepsy. The constant strain may also
cause red or inflamed lids. Parents and teachers must be on the
constant lookout for these symptoms of good sight persisting in spite
of imperfect eyes.

An epidemic of eyeglasses is usually the consequence of eye tests. So
naturally do we associate eyeglasses with [79]eye defects that some
people assert that the eye tests at school originate with opticians
more intent upon selling spectacles than upon helping children. In
fact, even among educators who proclaim the need for eye tests there
has been far more talk of eyeglasses than of removable conditions that
cause eye strain. The women principals of New York City have sounded
an alarm, and urge more attention to light and to reading position,
more rest, more play, more hand work, less home study and less eye
work at school, rather than more eyeglasses to conceal temporarily the
effect of abusing children's eyes. Putting glasses on children without
changing causal conditions is like giving alcohol to consumptives. The
feeling of relief is deceptive. The trouble grows worse.

For some time to come eye tests will find eye troubles by the
wholesale in every industrial and social class, in country as well as
city schools. In 415 New York villages 48.7 per cent of school
children had defects of vision,       this without testing children under
seven,       while 11.3 per cent had sore eyes.

There are three possible ways of remedying defects: (1) changing the
eye by operation; (2) changing the light as it enters the eye by
eyeglasses; (3) decreasing the demands made upon the eye. To change
eyes or light requires a technical skill which few physicians as yet
possess. It will be remembered that it is but thirty years since the
medical profession in America first began to understand the relation
of eye defects to other defects. Until a generation of physicians has
been trained by medical colleges to learn the facts about the eye and
to apply scientific remedies, it is especially necessary that teachers
and parents reduce the demands made upon children's eyes; oral can be
substituted for written work, manual for optical work, relaxed and
natural movement for discipline, outdoor exercise for less home study.
Other requirements are [80]suitable light and proper position, and
abolition of shiny paper, shiny blackboard, and fine print. Even after
it is easy to obtain the correction of eye defects it will still be
necessary to adapt the demands upon children's eyes to the strength
and shape of those eyes. Because we are born farsighted, nearsighted,
and astigmatic, we must be watchful to eradicate conditions that
aggravate these troubles. Finally, there is no excuse whatever for
permitting the parent of any school child in the United States to
remain ignorant of the fact that it is just as absurd to go to the
druggist or jeweler for eyeglasses as to the hardware store for false
teeth.

The education of physician, oculist, and optician can be expedited by
eye tests in school and by the follow-up work of schools in removing
the prejudice of parents against glasses when needed. Because
knowledge of chemistry preceded knowledge of the human body, the
teaching of medicine still shows the effect of predilection for the
remote, the problematical, the impossible. This predilection has
influenced many specialists as well as many general practitioners,
both overlooking too frequently obvious causes that even intelligent
laymen can be taught to detect. Very naturally the man who makes money
out of attention to simple troubles has stepped into the field not as
yet occupied by the general practitioner and the specialist. Thus we
have the optician, the painless tooth extractor, and quack cures for
consumption. Opticians are placing before hundreds of thousands simple
truths about the eye not otherwise taught as yet. Because they make
their money by selling eyeglasses and because their special knowledge
pertains to glasses rather than to eyes they frequently fail to
recognize their limitations.

Physicians feel very strongly that it is as unethical for an optician
to fit eyeglasses without a physician's prescription as for a
pharmacist to give drugs without a physician's [81]prescription. The
justification for this feeling should be based not upon the commercial
motive of the optician but upon his ignorance. A physician uninformed
as to eye troubles is just as unsafe as an optician determined to sell
glasses. It must be made unethical and unprofessional for physician
and optician alike to prescribe in the dark. Laymen and physicians
must be taught that it is just as unethical and unprofessional for
oculists and physicians to fail to bring their knowledge within the
practical reach of the masses as for the optician to advertise his
wares. School tests will not have been used to their utmost
possibilities until optician and physician alike take the ethical
position that the first consideration is the patient's welfare, not
their own profits. It must soon be recognized as unethical and
unprofessional for an optician who is also a skilled physician to
refer patients to a medical practitioner ignorant as to optical
science.

Whether opticians and physicians are unprofessional or unethical may
be told by re      xamination if the examiner is himself competent and
ethical. There is no better judge of their efficiency than the patient
himself, who can tell whether the results promised have been effected.
Whether the work of a country oculist is efficient and ethical can be
learned: (1) by teaching country school children to recognize eye
strain; (2) by comparing his results with those of other physicians.
As soon as one or two states have tested eyes, we shall have an
average by which to compare each class, school, and city with others
of their size under similar conditions. If a particular physician
finds half as many more or only half the average number, the
presumption will be that his results are inaccurate and warrant an
investigation. The interested teacher or parent can render an
inestimable service to her local school and to the children of her
state by taking steps to secure state laws compelling eye tests in all
schools.

[82]Finally, it must be remembered by teachers, employers, parents, and
all eye users that eyes are constantly changing; that eyes may need
glasses six months after they are examined and found sound; that
glasses change or develop the eye, so that they may be unnecessary and
harmful six months after they are prescribed, or the eye may require a
stronger glass; that eyeglasses become bent and scratched, so that
they worry and strain the eye; that a periodic examination is
essential to the health of the eye.

In caring for the health of the eye, we should also remember that our
eyes are our chief interpreters of the world that gives us problems,
profits, and pleasures. Out of gratitude, if not out of enlightened
self-interest, we owe our eyes protection, attention, and training, so
that without straining we shall always be able to see truth and
beauty.

CHAPTER VIIIToC

EAR TROUBLE, MALNUTRITION, DEFORMITIES


The presence of adenoids is a frequent cause of both slight and
aggravated deafness. Of 156 deaf mutes examined 59 per cent had
adenoids, while only 6 per cent of the general run of the children in
the neighborhood had this trouble. In mouth breathing, the current of
air entering the mouth draws out some of the air from the Eustachian
tube which ventilates the middle ear and unequalizes the atmospheric
pressure on the eardrum, causing it to sink in and to blunt the
hearing. An examination of the eardrums of school children in New York
who are mouth breathers showed a high percentage of deafness,
incipient or pronounced, accompanying adenoids. For example, of 9
mouth breathers selected from one class (average age 7-8 years), 6
were well-marked cases of deafness. Of 8 mouth breathers (average age
8-9 years), and of 5 mouth breathers (average age 5-6 years), all had
noticeable defects of hearing. Many adults that suffer from deafness
maintain that they never had any trouble in childhood. Yet the
evidences of nose and throat trouble in childhood persist and disprove
such statements. The foundations of deafness in later life are, in
most instances, laid in childhood. Since the majority of cases of ear
trouble occurring in school children accompany diseased conditions of
the nose and throat, the proper care of nose and throat will, in large
measure, balance the shortcomings of the aural examinations. Since the
examination of the drum itself is not practicable, especial care
should be given to the examination of the nose and throat.

[84]The figures published by New York City's department of health show
that of 274,641 children examined from March, 1905, to January, 1908,
3540, or 1.2 per cent, gave evidence of defective hearing. Ear
specialists suggest that this small percentage results from employing
the whisper test at twenty feet. The whisper test at sixty feet has
been set by experts as a test of normal hearing. But preciseness with
this test is well-nigh impossible when we consider that the acoustics,
the quality of the examiner's voice, the weather, the vowel or
consonant sounds, all are variable quantities. The watch test is
frequently used, but since a young teacher in her enthusiasm used an
alarm clock to make the test, specialists have decided that the volume
of sound differs in watches to such a degree as to make the watch test
unreliable. The examination of the eye has been reduced to
mathematical precision, due altogether to the anatomy of that organ.
As yet there is no instrument for the ear comparable to the
ophthalmoscope. The acoumeter is largely used by aurists and can be
obtained from the optician. This instrument has an advantage over the
whisper or watch tests in that its tick is uniform.

Each ear should be tested separately. Let the child place his finger
against the flap of one ear while the other is being tested. Then
compare the farthest distance from the ear at which the tick can be
heard with the normal, standard distance. During the test all sound
should be eliminated as far as possible and the eyes should be closed.
At a demonstration of ear testing at Teachers College, one student
stated that she could not hear the tick of the watch at a distance
greater than twenty inches. Then the tester walked noisily toward her,
leaving the watch on the desk, five feet away from the patient. She
heard it now. When the class burst out laughing she opened her eyes,
and, seeing the watch so far away, exclaimed, "Why, [85]I thought I
imagined it." Be careful in testing a child to distinguish between
what he "thinks he imagines" and what he really hears. Because of the
difficulties of this test a doubt should be sufficient to warn the
teacher to send the child to be tested by an expert. Detection of
slight deafness may lead to the discovery of serious defects of nose
or throat. Inflammation from cold or catarrh may cause deafness, which
if neglected may permanently injure the ear. Often deafness is due to
an accumulation of wax. A running ear should receive immediate
attention, as it is an indication of inflammation which may imperil
the integrity of the eardrum, and, if neglected, may eat its way
through the thin partition between the ear and the brain and cause
death.

It should never be assumed that deafness is incurable. Stupidity,
inattention, and slowness to grasp a situation accompany difficulty of
hearing and should cause the teacher to examine the ears. No ear
trouble is negligible. Children and parents should be taught that the
normal ear is intended to hear for us, not to divert our attention to
itself. When the ear aches or "runs" or rumbles there is something
wrong, and it should be examined together with the throat and nose.



Nervousness

In New York City one child in ninety-one already examined has had the
form of nervous disease known as St. Vitus's Dance, or chorea. So
prone are we to overlook moderate evils and moderate needs that the
child with aggravated St. Vitus's Dance is apt to be cured sooner than
the child who is just "nervous." Teachers cannot know whether
twitching eyes, emotional storms, constant motion of the fingers or
feet are due to chorea, to malnutrition, to eye strain, or to habits
acquired in babyhood or early childhood and continued for the
advantage that [86]accrues when discipline impends. Many a child
treasures as his chief asset in time of trouble the ability to lose
his temper, to have a "fit," to exhibit nervousness that frightens
parent, teacher, or playmate, incites their pity, and wards off
punishment. The school examination will settle once for all whether
the trouble can be cured. The family physician will explain what steps
to take.



Tests of Malnutrition

We Americans were first interested in the physical examination of
school children by exaggerated estimates of the number of children who
are underfed. As fast as figures were obtained for eye defects,
breathing defects, bad teeth, some one was ready to declare that these
were results of underfeeding. Hence the conclusion: give children at
least one meal a day at school. Scientific men began to set us
straight and to give undernourishment a technical meaning,       soft
bones, flabby tissue, under size, an       mia. While too little food might
cause this condition, it was also explained that too much food of the
wrong sort, or even food of the right sort eaten irregularly or
hurriedly or poisoned by bad teeth, might also cause undernourishment,
including the extreme type known as malnutrition. In extreme instances
the symptoms enable an observant teacher who has learned to
distinguish between the pretty hair ribbon and clean collar and the
sunken, pale, or hectic cheek and lusterless eyes to detect the cause.
But as with eyes and nose, an unhealthy condition [87]of nourishment may
exist long before outward symptoms are noticeable. Therefore the value
of the periodic searching examination by the school physician.




SAME AGE, SAME SCHOOL, DIFFERENT NUTRITION





Bone Tuberculosis; Orthopedic Tests

Only recently have we laymen learned that knee trouble, clubfoot,
ankle sores, spine and hip troubles, scrofula, running sores at
joints, etc., are not hereditary and inevitable, but are rather the
direct result of carelessness on the part of adult consumptives. These
conditions in school are indices of homes and houses where
tuberculosis is or has been active, and of health boards that are or
have been inactive in checking the white plague. Early examination may
disclose the small lump on the child's spine,       which one mother
diagnosed as inherited "round shoulders,"       and save a child from being
a humpback for life. Moreover, the examination of the crippled child's
brothers and sisters will often show the beginnings of pulmonary
tuberculosis.




A GRIEVOUS PENALTY FOR NEGLECT BY ADULT CONSUMPTIVES


[88]

Enlarged Glands       Tuberculosis

In almost every class are one or more children who are proud of small
or big lumps under one or more jaws. Only physicians can find very
small lumps. Many family doctors will say, "Oh, he will outgrow
those," or "Those lumps will be absorbed." Like most other evils that
we "outgrow" or that pass away, these lumps shriek not to be
neglected. They mean interference with nourishment and prevent proper
action of the lymphatic system, as adenoids prevent free breathing.
Even when not actually infected with tubercle bacilli, they are
fertile soil for the production of these germs. If detected early,
they point to home conditions and personal habits that can be easily
corrected. In New York one child in four has these enlarged glands. If
the same proportion prevails in other parts of the United States,
there are 5,400,000 children whose strength is being needlessly
drained, many of whom, if neglected, will need repeated operations.

CHAPTER IXToC

DENTAL SANITATION


"Have their teeth attended to first, and many of the eye defects will
disappear." This was an unexpected contribution to the debate upon
free eyeglasses for the school children of New York City. So little do
most of us realize the importance of sound, clean teeth, and the
interrelation of stomach and sense nerves, that even the school
principals thought the eye specialist was exaggerating when he
declared that bad teeth cause indigestion and indigestion causes eye
strain.

"Bad" teeth mean to most people dirty teeth and offensive odors,
loose, crooked, or isolated teeth, or black stumps. Even among
dentists a great many, probably the majority, do not appreciate that
"bad" teeth mean indigestion, lowered vitality, plague spots for
contaminating sound teeth and for breeding disease germs. Until
recently the only rule about the teeth of new recruits in the United
States army was: "There must be two opposing molars on each side of
the mouth. It doesn't matter how rotten these molars may be." The
surgeon general was persuaded to change to "four opposing molars on
each side"; still nothing as to the condition of the two additional
molars! In the German army there is a regular morning inspection of
teeth and toothbrushes. Several German insurance companies give free
dental treatment to policy holders, not to bestow charity but to
increase profits.

Neglecting "baby teeth" and adenoids may mean crooked second teeth
that will cause: (1) hundreds of dollars for straightening; (2)
permanent business handicap because crooked teeth are disagreeable to
others, because mastication [90]is less perfect, and because a disfigured
mouth means dis-arranged nerves; or perhaps (3) large dental bills
because it is difficult to clean between cramped, crooked teeth.

Unfortunately the great majority of parents rarely think of their
children's teeth until too late to preserve them intact. Even among
families where the rule of brushing the teeth twice daily prevails,
regular dental examination is often not required. Doctors and dentists
themselves have not been trained to realize that the teeth are a most
dangerous source of infection when unclean. Does your dentist insist
upon removing tartar and food particles beyond your reach, upon
polishing and cleansing, or does he regard these as vanity touches, to
be omitted if you are in a hurry?




INDUSTRIAL HANDICAPS DISCOVERED AT SCHOOL


Physicians send tuberculosis patients to hospitals or camps without
correcting the mouth conditions that make it impossible for the
patient to eat or swallow without infecting [91]himself. Tonics are given
to women whose teeth are breeding and harboring disease germs that
tear down vitality. Nurses watch their suffering patients and do the
heavier tasks heroically, but are not trained to teach the simple
truths about dental hygiene. The far-reaching results of neglect of
teeth will not be understood until greater emphasis is placed on the
bacteriology, the economics, the sociology, and the        sthetics of
clean, sound teeth. Whether or not there is at present a tendency to
exaggerate the importance of sound teeth, there is no difference of
opinion as to the fact that the teeth harbor virulent germs, that the
high temperature of the mouth favors germ propagation, that the twenty
to thirty square inches of surface constantly open to bacterial
infection offer an extensive breeding ground, and that the formation
of the teeth invites the lodgment of germs and of particles of food
injurious both to teeth and to other organs.

By scraping the teeth with the finger nail and noticing the odor you
can convince yourself of the presence of decomposing organic matter
not healthful to be carried into the stomach. By applying a little
iodine and then washing it off with water, your teeth may show stains.
These stains are called gelatinous plaques, which are transparent and
invisible to the naked eye except when colored by iodine. These
plaques protect the germs, which ferment and create the acid which
destroys tooth structure. Their formation can be prevented by vigorous
brushing and by eating hard food.

The individual with decayed teeth, even with unclean teeth, is open to
infection of the lungs, tonsils, stomach, glands, ears, nose, and
adenoid tissues. Every time food is taken, and at every act of
swallowing, germs flow over the tonsils into the stomach. Mouth
breathers with teeth in this condition cannot get one breath of
uncontaminated air, for every breath becomes infected with poisonous
emanations from the teeth. Bad teeth are frequently the sole [92]cause of
bad breath and dyspepsia, and can convey to the system tuberculosis of
the lungs, glands, stomach, or nose, and many other transmissible
diseases. They may also cause enlarged tonsils and ear trouble.

Apart from decomposing food and stagnant septic matter from saliva
injured by indigestion, and by sputum which collects in the healthy
mouth, there are in many infected mouths pus, exudations from the
irritated and inflamed gum margins, gaseous emanations from decaying
teeth, putrescent pulp tissue, tartar, and chemical poisons. Every
spray from such a mouth in coughing, sneezing, or even talking or
reading, is laden with microbes which vitiate the air to be breathed
by others. Indigestion from imperfect mastication and imperfect
salivation (themselves often due solely to bad teeth) is far less
serious than indigestion from germ infection. Germs taken into the
stomach can so change the composition of saliva (a natural
disinfectant when healthy) as to render it no longer able to kill
germs. Indigestion may result in excess of uric acid and toxic
material, so that the individual becomes subject to gout and
rheumatism, which in turn frequently destroy the bony support of the
teeth and bring about Riggs's Disease. The last named is a prevalent
and disfiguring disease, whose symptom is receding gums. The
irritating toxins deposited on the teeth cause inflammation of the
tissues at the gum margins. The gums withdraw more and more from
sections of the teeth; the poisons get underneath and work back toward
the roots; the infection increases and hastens the loosening of the
teeth. I know of a man who had all of his teeth extracted at
twenty-one years of age, because he was told that this was the only
treatment for this disease, which was formerly thought to be
incurable. Yet thorough cleansing and removal of this matter from
under the edges of the gums, disinfection, a few visits to the
dentist, will stop the recession but cannot regain lost ground.

[93]Among those who regularly use the toothbrush, instinct, comfort, or
display is the ruling motive, while a small percentage have evolved to
the anti-nuisance stage, where the        sthetic standard of their group
forbids any member to neglect his teeth. The anti-slum and pro-slum
motives for mouth cleanliness and dental sanitation have been awakened
in but one or two places. A significant pro-slum activity is the
dental clinic organized by forty volunteer dentists, acting for an
industrial school maintained by the New York Children's Aid Society.




NEW YORK CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY'S DENTAL CLINIC FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN


Here 550 children have been examined, 447 teeth extracted, 284 teeth
filled, 200 teeth treated for diseased pulp (and only 24 sets
cleaned), 40 dentists taking turns in giving time to this work. The
equipment cost but $239; cards and stationery, $72; incidentals, $33.
The principal attends the clinic, because in her presence no child is
willing to confess fear or unwillingness. To supplement this work, the
dentists have prepared for free distribution a leaflet which tells in
short, clear sentences how to care for the teeth.

[94]






Such a leaflet should be given out at dispensaries, hospitals, dental
offices, schools, and from many Sunday schools and missions.[5]

[95]The time for the schools to begin is when the child is first
registered. Examination and re      xamination must be accompanied by
explanation of the serious disadvantages of neglected teeth, and the
physical, social, and economic advantages of clean, sound teeth.
Instruction at school must be followed by education of parents. The
school or health authorities should examine the teeth of all children
before issuing work certificates. Finally, the dental, medical, and
nursing professions and the press must be enlisted in the school's
campaign for dental hygiene. The Dental Hygiene Council of
Massachusetts should be copied in all states.

A preliminary examination of teeth can be made by parent or teacher.
Crooked, loose, dirty, or black teeth or receding gums can be detected
by a layman's naked eye. In fact, children can be interested in
finding the most obvious defects in their own or their brothers'
teeth. There could be no better first lesson than to ask each pupil to
look in a hand mirror and to count each tooth obviously needing a
cleaning or a filling. The most urgent need can thus be ascertained
without expert aid. But because parent, teacher, or child cannot
discover defects does not prove that dental care is not imperative;
hence the importance of examination by a dentist or by a physician
competent to discover dental needs. If a private, public, or parochial
school has no paid visiting dentist, a zealous school officer can, at
least in large towns, persuade one or more dentists or physicians to
make a few first tests to confirm the teacher's findings, and to
persuade the community that regular examination and re      xamination are
necessary and a saving of pain, beauty, and money.

Re      xamination is necessary because decay may start the day after a
dentist has pronounced a tooth sound. For most of us twice a year is
often enough. A re      xamination should be made upon the slightest
suspicion of decay, breaking, or loosening.

[96]Educational use should be made by the teacher of the results of school
examination. Children cannot be made self-conscious and cleanly by
telling them that their teeth will ache three or five years from now.
They can be made to brush or wash their teeth every morning and every
night if they once realize that cavities can be caused only by mouth
garbage. All decay of human teeth starts from the outside through the
enamel that covers the soft bone of the tooth. This enamel can be
destroyed by accidentally cracking or breaking it, or by acids eating
into it. These acids come from (1) particles of food allowed to remain
in the teeth; (2) tartar, etc., that adheres to the teeth and can be
removed only by a dentist; (3) saliva brought up from an
ill-conditioned stomach. Even where the enamel is destroyed, absolute
cleanliness will prevent serious decay of the tooth. A perfectly clean
tooth will not decay. Generally speaking, unless particles of food or
removable acids remain on or between the teeth long enough to
decompose, teeth cannot decay. Decay always means, therefore,
uncleanliness. To unclean teeth is due in large part the offensive
odor of many schoolrooms.




AN ARMENIAN SCHOOL GIRL


Uncleanliness becomes noticeable to our neighbors sooner or later.
There is no offense we are so reluctant to commit as that of having
uncleanliness of our bodies disagreeable to those about us. Very young
children will make every effort in their power to live up to the
school's standard of cleanliness. The other side to this reason for
having clean teeth is vanity. Because all cleanliness is beautiful to
us, clean teeth are one attribute of beauty that all of us can
possess.

Habits of cleanliness are easily fixed. In the most crowded, most
overworked section of large cities visitors from "uptown" are
surprised by the children's bright hair ribbons, clean aprons, clean
faces, and smoothly combed hair. It will be easy to add clean teeth to
the list of things necessary to personal and family standing. Armenian
children [97]are taught to clean their teeth after eating, even if only
an apple between meals. They covet "beautiful teeth." American
standards will soon prevent these Armenians from cleaning their teeth
in public, but desire for beautiful teeth will stay, and will remind
them to care for their teeth in private. As coarse food gives way to
sugars and soft foods, stiff toothbrushes must supplement tongue and
toothpicks.

Strong as are the instinct and display motives in cleaning teeth, both
parents and children need to be reached through the commerce motive.
Instinct makes children afraid of the dentist, or content when the
tooth stops aching. Display may be satisfied with cleaning the front
teeth, as many boys comb only the front hair or as girls hide dirty
scalps under pompadours and pretty ribbons. Desire to save money may
give stronger reasons for not going to the dentist than instinct and
comfort can urge for going. But parents can be made to see, as can
children after they begin to picture themselves as wage earners, that
a dentist in time saves nine, and that no regular family investment
will earn more money than the price of prompt and regular dental care.
A problem in arithmetic would be convincing, if, by questions such as
those on page 98, we could compare the family cost of neglecting teeth
with the cost of toothbrushes, bicarbonate of soda, pulverized chalk
or tooth powder, early and repeated examination by a dentist, and
treatment when needed.

[98]



  
  How many members in your family?
    How many teeth have they?
    How many teeth have they lost?
    How many false teeth have they?
    How many teeth have been filled?
    What is the total cost to date?
    How many days have been lost from work because of toothache?
    How many teeth are now decayed?
    What will it cost to have them attended to?
        
  What does a toothbrush cost?
    How many do you need in one year?
    How much does tooth powder cost?
    How much is needed for one year?
    How much would two examinations a year by a dentist cost?
  



The result will show that the money spent for one good "house
cleaning" of one child at fourteen or eighteen exceeds the cost of
keeping clean and in repair the teeth of the entire family. How
effective and economical is thorough cleaning is confessed by an
eminent dentist, who taught an assistant to clean his patients' teeth.
"Do you know," he said, "I had to stop it, so perceptibly did my work
decrease." The total time required to examine school children for
teeth needing attention is much less than the time now lost by absence
from school or wasted at school on account of toothache.




WON BY THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT


To remind school children regularly of dental hygiene is not more
important than for the school to remind parents repeatedly of the many
reasons for attending to their children's teeth. It is not enough,
however, to send one message to parents. Illustrated lectures,
mothers' meetings, demonstrations at hospitals and fresh-air homes are
all very serviceable, but listening is a poor substitute for
understanding. Schools should see that parents understand the
       sthetics, the economics, the humanity of dental hygiene. [99]The best
test of whether the parent has understood is the child's tooth.

Dental examination of children applying for work certificates gives
the health and school authorities a means of enforcing their precepts.
When no child is allowed to go to work whose teeth cause malnutrition
or disgust, the news will spread, and both child and parent will see
clearly the grave need for dental care.

Finally, local papers can be interested. They will print almost
anything the teacher sends about the need for dental care. They like
particularly facts about the number of cavities found, the number of
children needing care, efforts made to procure care, and new facts
about diseases that can be caused by bad teeth or about diseases that
can injure teeth. Teachers can persuade dentists and physicians to
write stories. No newspaper will refuse to print such statements as
this: "A tuberculous patient in six weeks lost ground steadily. I
persuaded him to go to a dentist to clean the vestibule to his
digestive system, and to have a set of false teeth. He enjoys his
meals, and has gained twelve pounds in six weeks." Popular magazines
and newspapers mention teeth seldom, because those who best know the
interesting vital things are making money, not writing articles or
otherwise concerning themselves with dental education. It is said that
of forty thousand American dentists not over eleven thousand are
readers of dental journals, and probably not three hundred contribute
to professional [100]literature. One dentist who is working for the
children's clinic described above, when asked by the board of
education to lecture to the people on the care of the teeth and to
recommend simple, readable books, told me that he knew no good books
to suggest.

Five obstacles exist to practicing what is here preached:

1. The expensiveness of proper dentistry.

2. The untrustworthiness of cheap dental service and "painless"
dental parlors; the domination of the supply houses wishing to
sell instruments and other supplies.

3. The ethical objection to any kind of advertising or to work by
wholesale.

4. The lack of dispensaries.

5. The profit-making basis of dental education.

Additional reasons these for cleanliness that will make the dentist
serviceable for his knowledge rather than for his time and gold.

Good dentists really "come too high" for both the poor and the
comfortably situated. Families in New York City that have four or five
thousand dollars a year hesitate to go to a dentist whom they
thoroughly trust, because his time is worth more than they feel they
can afford to pay.

The "free-extraction" dental parlors undoubtedly are doing a vast
amount of harm. In every city are dental quacks that injure
wage-earning adults as much as soothing-sirup quacks injure babies.
Instead of teaching people to preserve their teeth, they extract, and
then, by dint of overpersuading by a pretty cashier hired for the
purpose, make a contract for a gold crown or a false set at an
exorbitant price. A reputable dentist has said that a dental parlor
can do more damage to the welfare of the race in a few months than a
well-intentioned man in the profession can repair in a lifetime. Its
question is not, What can I do for this patient? but What is there in
this mouth for me? Many "parlors" never expect to see the same [101]person
twice, because they do not make him comfortable or gain his
confidence; they put a filling in on top of decayed matter or even
diseased pulp; put in plates and bridges that do not fit; charge more
than the examination at first leads one to expect; refuse to correct
mistakes; deny having ever seen the patient before. Yet true and
severe as this arraignment is, many of these parlors, with their
liveried "runners in," are doing an educational service not otherwise
provided; it is conceivable that in many cities they are doing less
harm by their malpractice than well-intentioned men in the profession
by neglect of public needs or by failure to organize facilities for
meeting those needs.

I realize that advertising is "unethical" among dentists as among
physicians. Humbug and imposition are supposed to go inevitably with
self-advertising by the methods used in selling shoes or automobiles.
Therefore such advertising is prohibited. But what seems to be
forgotten in this definition of ethics is that the need and the
opportunity for dental care must be advertised in some way, if we are
ever to control diseases and evils due to bad teeth. The rich that one
dentist can help are able to pay for his good taste, his neat
attendants, his automobile, his club dues, his vacations at
fashionable resorts, his hours without work, his standard of living.
All of these things advertise him, just as hospital appointments and
social position may and do advertise successful physicians. The
patients of moderate means that one dentist can treat cannot afford to
pay for rent, time disengaged, and indirect advertising. Either they
must have free treatment, must go without treatment, or must go to a
dental parlor where dental needs are organized so that a very large
number will contribute to rent and display. It is out of the question
to have both dentists and patients so distributed and prices so
adjusted that dentists can make a good living by charging what the
patient can afford, and at the same time admit of every [102]patient being
properly treated when necessary. Judging from every other branch of
work, the solution of the problem lies partly in free care for those
who can pay nothing or very little, and partly in co      perative
treatment through the heretofore objectionable dental parlors. If
instead of inveighing against advertisers, honorable and capable
dentists worked through dental and medical societies to secure
adequate public supervision of dental practice, more progress would be
made against dental malpractice.

Dental clinics will quickly follow the publication of facts that
schools should gather. In some places these should be separate; but at
first the best thing is to make every hospital, every children's home,
every settlement a clinic, and every school an examining center. A
skilled dentist informs me: "The demand that will follow examination
of school children's teeth will make it profitable for young dentists
to adopt a co      perative scheme, where several young men hire a parlor
in a cheap district, and, under the supervision of some experienced
dentist, give good advice at reasonable rates. This is the best
antidote to the dental parlor which exploits the public so
shamelessly." Bellevue Hospital in New York is the first general
hospital to establish regular dental examination; others will
undoubtedly soon follow.

Dental education for profit rather than for instruction and for health
has been the rule. Even where universities have put in dental courses,
they have demanded a net profit from tuition. Instead of protecting
society against men incapable of caring for teeth, the schools have
marketed certificates to as large numbers as slowly enlightened
self-interest would permit. Much progress has been made toward uniform
standards of admission and graduation, but dental colleges sadly need
the light and the inspiration of school facts about teeth.

Of fourteen dental journals in America, only one has the advancement
of dental science as its first reason for [103]existence. Thirteen are
trade journals. Not one of these would print articles proving that the
supplies advertised by their backers were inimical to dental hygiene.
Many dental colleges still retain on their faculties agents or editors
in the pay of supply houses, Harvard's new dental school being a
notable exception. This trade motive tolerates and encourages the
disreputable practices of existing dental parlors. Largely because of
this prostitution of the dental profession, patients generally neglect
the repairing and cleansing of the teeth and the sterilizing of the
mouth from which germs are carried to all parts of the body. Dental
journalism for the sale of supplies cannot outlive the dentist's
reading of the school's index.

Many dentists will say that they must learn dentistry before they
learn the economics and sociology of clean teeth. Being a young
profession, it is natural that dentistry should first devote itself to
learning its own mechanics,       the tricks of the trade       how to fill
teeth. But the fact that it took the medical profession centuries to
begin to feel responsibility for community health is no reason why the
social sense of the dentist should be dormant for centuries or
decades. We need training and exercise to determine what kind of
filling will be most comfortable and most serviceable; whether the
pulp of the teeth needs treating or removing before the filling is
inserted; whether it is worth while to fill a deciduous or baby tooth.
Sociology will never take the place of dental technic. The few
dentists who have studied the social significance and social
responsibility of their profession declare, however, that careless
workmanship and indifferent education of patients continue chiefly
because dentists themselves do not see the community's interest in
dental hygiene. The school can socialize or humanize the dental
profession if teachers themselves possess the social sense and make
known the facts about the need for dental care among school children.

CHAPTER XToC

ABNORMALLY BRIGHT CHILDREN


What is commonly considered abnormal brightness in a school child is
often a tendency to live an abnormal physical life. Being a child
bookworm means that time is spent indoors that should be spent playing
games with one's fellows. Excellence in the activities of children,
not ability to imitate the activities of adults, should be the test of
child brightness. To be able to hit a bull's-eye, to throw a ball
accurately, to calculate the swing of a curve or the bound of a
"grounder," these are tests of brightness quite as indicative of
mental power as the ability to win highest marks in school, while less
injurious to physical power. The child who is abnormally bright
requires special treatment just as much as the child who is abnormally
dull. The former as well as the latter must have his abnormal
condition corrected if he is to grow into a normally bright man.

The college man who sacrifices health to "marks" is thus described by
the director of physical training at Harvard University:

A drooping head, a pale face, dull, sunken eyes, flat chest and
rounded shoulders, with emaciated limbs, soft flabby muscles, and
general lack of good physical, mental, and moral tone.

For the protection of these physical defective grinds it is suggested
to put a physical qualification upon the candidates of Phi Beta Kappa
and their awards of scholarship. If scholarship men cannot be induced
to take time to improve their physique for fear of lowering their
college standing, then give them credit for standing in physical
work.

[105]The abnormally bright, at whatever age, is as much a subject for
examination and treatment as the child with adenoids and pulmonary
tuberculosis. Such attention will increase the percentage of
abnormally bright schoolmates who figure in active business in later
life. Moreover, it will decrease the number of high school
superintendents who declare that their honor pupils are physical
wrecks.

There are children who develop very rapidly, both physically and
mentally, and whose mental superiority is not at the expense of their
bodies. Protection of such children requires that their minds be
permitted to progress as rapidly as bodily health justifies. It is as
cruel to keep back a physically and mentally superior child, as to
push the physically or mentally defective beyond his powers. Worry and
fatigue can be produced by lack of interest as well as by overwork.
"Normal" should not be confused with "average." To keep a bright child
back with the average child       marking time till the dull ones catch
up       is to make him abnormal. The tests that we have employed for
grading pupils are either the tests of age in years or of mental
capacity. The first takes no account of slowness or rapidity of
physiological development,       of physiological age. The second
encourages mental activity at the expense of physique. The entrance of
a child into school, the promotion from one class to another, the
entrance into college, are thus determined either by the purely
artificial test of age or by the individual teacher's discretion.
There is nothing to prevent the ambitious teacher or the ambitious
parent from pushing a child into kindergarten at four, high school at
twelve, college at fifteen. If this cannot be done at the public
school, a private school is resorted to. A community of college
professors once started a school for faculty children. A tremendous
pressure was put upon these scions of intellectual aristocracy to
enter the high school at twelve. No thought was given to the
ventilation of the school. The [106]windows were so arranged that they
could not be opened without the air blowing on some child's back. "You
could cut the air with a knife" was a description given by one
sensible professor who had taken his sturdy girl of seven away from
the school, because he feared that in this environment she would
become like the other little puny, pale, undersized children of that
school.

The University of Pennsylvania has instituted a psychological clinic.
Parents and teachers are invited to bring any deviation from the usual
or the expected to the attention of this clinic. Every month a
bulletin is published called the Psychological Clinic, which will be
found of great service in dealing with the abnormally bright as well
as with the abnormally dull. Naturally the well-to-do and the rich are
the first to take advantage of these special facilities for
ascertaining just what work should be done by a precocious child or by
the mentally and morally retarded.

Abnormal brightness means power to be happy and to be serviceable that
is above the average. Every school can be a miniature psychological
clinic. While every teacher cannot be an expert, national and state
superintendents can constantly remind teachers that the abnormally
bright are also abnormally apt to neglect physical welfare and to
endanger future mental power.






[107]

CHAPTER XIToC

NERVOUSNESS OF TEACHER AND PUPIL


Nervousness of teacher and pupil deserves special mention. So
universal is this physical defect that we take it for granted,
especially for teachers. Teachers themselves feel that they need not
even apologize for nervousness, in fact they too frequently use it as
an excuse for impatience, ugly temper, discourtesy, and unfairness.
Children, slates, papers, parents, blackboards "get on their nerves."
Nervousness of teacher causes nervousness of pupils and adds to the
evil results of mouth breathing, bad teeth, eye strain, and
malnutrition. These conditions, added to bad ventilation, bad light,
and an overcrowded schoolroom, render the atmosphere thoroughly
charged with electricity       nerves       toward the end of the day. Lack of
oxygen to breathe as well as inability to breathe it; lack of
well-printed books and good light, as well as lack of the power to use
them; toothache, earache, headache, deplete the vitality of both
teacher and pupil.

Most of the disturbances at school are but outward signs of
unwholesome physical conditions. If the teacher attempts to treat
these causes by crushing the child, she makes confession of her own
nervousness and inadequacy and visits her own suffering upon her
pupils. A transfixing glance prolonged into an overbearing stare, a
loud, sharp voice, a rough manner, are successful only so far as they
work on the nervousness of her pupil. She finds that it is temporarily
effective, and so by her example and practice sets the child an
example in losing control of himself. The position often assumed by
school children when before authority, [108]of hands held stiffly at the
side, head drooped, and roving eye, does not mean control: it means a
crushed spirit, hypocrisy, or brooding anarchy. The mother or teacher
who obtains obedience by clapping her hands, pointing her finger,
distorting her face, is copying in her own home the attitudes of caste
in India, of serfdom in Russia, the discipline of the prison the world
over, a modern reminder of the power of life and death or of physical
torture.

A young college girl unfamiliar with the ways of the public school was
substituting in the highest grammar grade. The time for civics
arrived. Here, she thought, is a subject in which I can interest them.
The boys showed a vast amount of press information, as well as decided
opinions on the politics of the day. The candidates which they elected
for the position of ideal American patriot were Rockefeller, Lincoln,
and Sharkey the prize fighter. During the ensuing debate, which gave
back to Lincoln his proper rank, the boys in the back of the room had
moved forward and were sharing seats with the boys in the front. Every
boy was engrossed in the discussion. The room was in perfect
order,       not, however, according to the ideas of the principal, who
entered at that moment to see how the new substitute was managing the
class, famed for its bad boys. With the stern look of a Simon Legree
she demanded, "How dare you leave your seats!" When one child started
to explain she shouted: "How dare you speak without permission! Don't
you know your teacher never permits it? Every boy take his own seat at
his own desk." This principal was far more to be pitied than the boys,
for they had before them the prospect of "work papers" and a grind
less monotonous and more productive than the principal's discipline.
She was a victim of a nerve-racking system, more sinned against than
sinning.

There is nothing in school life per se to cause nervousness. Given a
well-aired, sunny room, where every child [109]has enough fresh air to
breathe, where he can see without strain, where he has a desk fitted
to his body and work fitted to his maximum abilities, a teacher who is
physically strong and mentally inspiring, and plenty of play space and
play time, there will be no nervousness. One who visits vacation
schools is struck with the difference in the atmosphere from that of
the winter day schools. Here are the same rooms, the same children,
and in many cases the same teachers, but different work. Each child is
busy with a bright, interested, happy expression and easy attitude.
Some are at nature study, some are weaving baskets, making dresses,
trimming hats, knitting bright worsted sacks and mittens for the
winter. Boys are at carpentering, raffia, or wrought-iron work. In
none of the rooms is the absolute unity or the methodical order of the
winter schoolroom, but rather the hum of the workroom and the order
that comes from a roomful of children interested in the progress of
their work. This condition only illustrates what a winter schoolroom
might be were physical defects corrected or segregated, windows open,
light good, and work adapted to the child.




VACATION SCHOOL INTEREST: AN ANTIDOTE TO NERVOUSNESS


[110]Nervousness is not a monopoly of city teachers and city pupils. In
country schools that I have happened to know, nervous children were
the chief problem. Nervousness led in scholarship, in disorder, in
absences, in truancy, and in backwardness. After reading MacDonald's
Annals of a Quiet Neighborhood, I became interested in one or two
particularly nervous children, just to see if I could overcome my
strong dislike for them. To one boy I gave permission to leave the
room or to go to the library whenever he began to lose his
self-control. My predecessors had not been able to control him by the
rod. A few weeks after Willie's emancipation from rules, the county
superintendent was astonished to see that the county terror led my
school in history, reading, and geography.

Had I known what every teacher should be taught in preparation,       the
relation of eye strain, bad teeth, adenoids, "overattention," and
malnutrition to nervousness and bad behavior,       I could have restored
many "incorrigibles" to nerve control. Had I been led at college to
study child psychology and child physiology, I should not have
expected a control that was possible only in a normal adult.[6] In its
primary aspect the question of nervousness in the schoolroom is purely
physiological, and the majority of principals and teachers are not
trained by professional schools how to deal with it. Normal schools
should teach the physical laws which govern the child's development;
should show that the pupil's mental, moral, and physical nature are
one and inseparable; that children cannot at one time be docile,
sickly, and intelligent,       perfect mentally and imperfect physically.
Until teachers are so taught, the condition cannot be changed that
makes of our schools manufactories of nervous teachers and pupils.

[111]Country nervousness, like city nervousness, is of three kinds: (1)
that caused by defective nervous systems; (2) that resulting from
physical defects other than defects of the nervous system, but
reacting upon it; (3) that due to habit or to lack of self-control.
Children who suffer from a defective nervous system should, in city
schools, be segregated where they can have special care under constant
medical supervision. Such children in schools too small for special
classes should be given special treatment. Their parents should know
that they have chorea, which is the same trouble as St. Vitus's Dance,
although often existing in a degree too mild to attract attention.
Special treatment does not mean that such children should be permitted
to interfere with the school progress of other children. In many rural
schools, where special privileges cannot be given children suffering
with chorea without injury to other children, it would be a kindness
to the unfortunates, to their parents, and to all other children, were
the parents requested to keep such children at home.

Nervousness that results from removable physical defects       eye strain,
adenoids, indigestion, earache       will be easily detected by physical
examination, and easily corrected by removing the physical defect.

Preventable nervousness due to "habit" can be quite as serious in its
effects upon the mind and health as the other two forms of
nervousness. Twitching the face, biting the nails, wetting the lips,
blinking the eyelids, continually toying with something, being in
perpetual motion and never relaxing, always changing from one thing to
the next, being forever on the rush, never accomplishing anything, are
common faults of both teacher and pupil. We call them mannerisms or
tricks of personality. They are readily imitated by children. I once
knew a young lawyer who had started life as an oyster dealer, whose
power of imitation helped to make him responsive to both helpful and
harmful influences. After [112]being at the same table for two weeks with
a talented man whom he admired, he acquired the latter's habit of
constantly twitching his shoulder and making certain gestures. These
habits in turn quickly produced a nervousness that interfered with his
power to reason straight.

Nervousness is often confused with aggressiveness, initiative,
confidence. "Think twice before you jump, and perhaps you won't want
to jump" is a very difficult rule to follow for any one whose bodily
movements are not under perfect control.

It is said that the confusion of city life causes habits of
nervousness. Unfortunately no one knows whether the city children or
the country children have the highest percentage of nervousness. There
is a general feeling that city life causes an unwholesome degree of
activity, yet one finds that those people in the city who least notice
the elevated railway are those whose windows it passes. City noises
irritate those who come from the country, or the city man on returning
to the city from the country, but a similar irritation is felt by the
city-bred man on coming to the country. Mr. Dooley's description of a
night in the country with the crickets and the mosquitoes and the
early birds shows that it is the unusual noise rather than the volume
or variety of noises that wreck nerves. At the time of the opening of
the New York schools in 1907 a newspaper published an editorial on
"Where can the city child study?" showing that in New York the
curriculum, the schoolhouse, and the tenements are so crowded and so
noisy that study is practically impossible. Lack of sleep, lack of a
quiet place in which to study at school and at home, are causes for
nervousness, whether these conditions are in the city or in the
country. What evidence is there that the country curriculum is less
crowded or country work better adjusted to the psychological and
physiological age of the country pupil? The index is there; it should
be read.

[113]In breaking habits of nervousness the first step is to explain how
easily habits are formed, why their effects may be serious, and how a
little attention will correct them. When a habit loses its mystery it
becomes unattractive. Children will take an interest in co      perating
with each other and with the teacher in curing habits acquired either
at home or at school. My pupils greatly enjoyed overcoming the habit
of jumping or screaming after some sudden noise. I told them how, when
a boy, my imagination had been very much impressed by one of
Thackeray's characters, the last remnant of aristocratic traditions,
almost a pauper, but possessing one attribute of nobility,       absolute
self-control. When his house burned he stood with his ankles crossed,
leaning on his cane, the only onlooker who was not excited. For months
I imitated that pose, using sticks and rakes and fork handles. The
result was that when I taught school, a scream, a broken desk, or
unusual noise outside reminded me of my old aristocrat in time to
prevent my muscles from jumping. In a very short time several fidgety
and nervous girls and boys had learned to think twice and to relax
before jumping.

One test of thorough relaxation in a dentist's chair proves the folly
of tightening one's muscles. When in school or out the remedy for
nervousness is relaxation. The discipline that prohibits a pupil from
stretching or changing his posture or seat is as much to be condemned
as that which flourishes the rod. It has been said of our schools that
children are not worked to death but bored to death. Wherever a room
must be stripped of all beauty and interest to induce concentration,
wherever the greater part of the teacher's time must be spent in
keeping order, there is confession either of inappropriateness of the
present curriculum or of the failure of teacher and text-book to
present subjects attractive to the pupils. Nervous habits will be
inevitable until the pupil's attention is obtained through interest.
[114]Sustained interest will be impossible until teacher and pupil alike
practice relaxation, not once a morning or twice a day, not during
recess or lunch hour, but whenever relaxation is needed.

In overcoming nervousness of teacher and pupil, both must be
interested in home causes as well as school causes of that
nervousness. Time must be found to ask questions about those causes
and to discuss means for removing them. Naturally it will be
embarrassing for a very nervous teacher to discuss nervousness with
children,       until after she has overcome her own lack of nerve
stability. To help her or to compel her to learn the art of relaxation
of bodily and of mental control is the duty and the privilege of the
school physician, of her doctor, and of superintendent and trustees.
The outside point of view is necessary, because of the peculiar fact
that almost every nervous person believes that he has unusually good
control over his nerves, just as a man in the midst of his anger will
declare that he is cool and self-controlled. Had Robert Burns been
thinking of the habit of nervousness he could not have thought of a
better cure than when he wrote:


Oh wad some power the giftie gie us
To see oursel's as ithers see us;
It wad frae mony a blunder free us,
And foolish notion.

CHAPTER XIIToC

HEALTH VALUE OF "UNBOSSED" PLAY AND PHYSICAL TRAINING


A boy without play means a father without a job. A boy without
physical training means a father who drinks. When people have
wholesome, well-disciplined bodies there will be less demand for
narcotics as well as for medicines. On these three propositions
enthusiasm has built arguments for city parks and playgrounds, for
school gymnastics, and for temperance instruction. We have tried the
remedies and now realize that too much was expected of them. Neither
movement appreciated the mental and physical education of spontaneous
games and play.

Like hygiene instruction, physical training was made compulsory by law
in many states, and, like hygiene instruction, physical training had
to yield to the pressure of subjects in which children are examined.
At the outset both were based upon distorted psychology and
physiology. Of late physical training has been revived "to correct
defects of the school desk and to relieve the strain of too prolonged
study periods." In New York grammar schools ten minutes a day for the
lower grades, and thirty minutes a week for the higher grades, are set
aside for physical training. With the exception of eighteen schools
where apparatus is used, the exercise has been in the class rooms. It
consists of what are known as "setting-up exercises,"       deep breathing
and arm movements for two minutes between each study period, often
forgotten until it is time to go home, when the children are tired and
need it least. Many teachers so conduct these exercises that children
keenly enjoy them.

[116]


SERVICEABLE RELIEF FROM SCHOOL STRAIN, BUT A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR OUTDOOR PLAY


Like hygiene instruction, physical training preceded physical
examination. Generally speaking, it has not yet, either in schools or
in colleges, been related to physical needs of the individual pupil.
In fact, there is no guarantee that it is not in many schools working
a positive injury on defective children or imposing a defective
environment on healthy children. Formal exercises in cramped space, in
ill-ventilated rooms, with tight belts and heavy shoes, are conceded
to be pernicious. Formal exercises should never be given to any child
without examination and prescription by a physician. Children with
heart weakness, enlarged tonsils, adenoid growths, spinal curvature,
uneven shoulders, are frequently seen doing exercises for which they
are physically unfit, and which but serve to deplete further their
already low vitality. Attention might be called to many a class
engaged in breathing exercises when by actual count over half the boys
were holding their mouths open. Special exercises are needed by
children who show some marked [117]defect like flat foot, flat chest, weak
abdominal muscles, habitual constipation, uneven shoulders, spinal
trouble, etc.

That no physical training should be provided for normal children is
the belief of many leading trainers. This special training is useful
to develop athletes or to correct defects. Like massage, osteopathy,
or medicine, it should follow careful diagnosis. The time is coming
when formal indoor gymnasium exercises for normal pupils or normal
students will be considered an anomaly. There is all the difference in
the world between physical development and what is called physical
training. The test of physical development is not the hours spent upon
a prescribed course of training, but the physical condition determined
by examination. To be refused permission to substitute an hour's walk
for an hour's indoor apparatus work is often an outrage upon health
laws. Given a normal healthy body, plenty of space, and plenty of
playtime, the spontaneous exercise which a child naturally chooses is
what is really health sustaining and health giving.

Mere muscular development artificially obtained through the devices of
a gymnasium is inferior to the mental and moral development produced
by games and play in the open air. Eustace Miles, M.D., amateur tennis
player of England, says:

I do not consider a mere athlete to be a really healthy man. He
has no more right to be called a really healthy man than the
foundations or scaffolding of a house have a right to be called a
house. They become a good house, and, indeed, they are
indispensable to a good house, but at present the good house
exists only in potentiality.

The "healthy-mindedness" and "physical morality" which play and games
foster rarely result from physical training as a business, at stated
times, indoors, under class direction. It is too much like taking
medicine. A certain breakfast food is said to have lost much of its
[118]popularity since advertised as a health food. When the National
Playground Association was organized President Roosevelt cautioned its
officers against too frequent use of the word "supervision" on the
ground that supervision and direction were apt to defeat the very
purpose of games and to stultify the play spirit. Is the little girl
on the street who springs into a hornpipe or a jig to the tune of a
hurdy-gurdy, or even the boy who runs before automobiles or trolley
cars or under horses' noses, getting less physical education than
those who play a round game in silence under the supervision of a
teacher in the school basement, or who stretch their arms up and down
to the tune of one, two, three, four, five, six? Who can doubt that
the much-pitied child of the tenement playing with the contents of the
ash can in the clothes yard or with baby brother on the fire escape is
developing more originality, more lung power, and better arteries than
the child of fortune who is led by the hand of a governess up and down
Fifth Avenue.

Children have not forgotten how to play, but adults have forgotten to
leave space in cities, and time out of school, home work, and factory
work in which children may play. Again, the child       whether a city
child or a country child       rarely needs to be taught how to play.
Teaching him games will not produce vitality. Games are the
spontaneous product of a healthy body, active mind, and a joy in
living. Give the children parks and piers, roof gardens and
playgrounds in which they may play, and leave the rest to them. Give
them time away from school and housework, and leave the rest to them.
Instead of lamenting the necessity for playing in the streets, let us
reserve more streets for children's play. There are too many students
of child welfare whose reasoning about play and games is like that of
a lady of Cincinnati, who, upon reading the notice of a child-labor
meeting, said: "Well, I am glad to see there is going to be a meeting
here for child labor. It is high time [119]some measure was taken to keep
the children off the streets." Physical examinations would prove that
streets are safer and better than indoor gymnasiums for growing
children. Intelligent physical training will train children to go out
of doors during recess; will train pupils and teachers not to use
recess for study, discipline, or eating lunch.




SPONTANEOUS PLAY ON ONE OF NEW YORK CITY'S SCHOOL ROOF PLAYGROUNDS


"After-school" conditions are quite as important as physical training
and gymnastics at school. Not long ago a nurse was visiting a sick
tenement mother with a young baby. She found a little girl of twelve
standing on a stool over a washtub. This child did all the housework,
took care of the mother and two younger children, got all the meals
except supper, which her father got on his return from work. As the
nurse removed the infant's clothes to give it a bath, the little girl
seized them and dashed them into the tub. "Yes, I am pretty tired when
night comes," she confessed. This child has prototypes in the country
as well as the city, and she did not need physical training. She did
not lack initiative or originality. She did need playmates, open air,
a run in the park, and "fun."

[120]The educational value of games and outdoor play should be weighed
against the advantages of lowering the compulsory school age, and of
bridging over the period from four to seven with indoor kindergarten
training. Neither physical training nor education is synonymous with
confinement in school. The whole tendency of Nature's processes in
children is nutritional; it is not until adolescence that she makes
much effort to develop the brain. Overuse of the young mind results,
therefore, in diverting natural energy from nutritive processes to
hurried growth of the overstimulated brain. The result is a type of
child with a puny body and an excitable brain,       the neurotic. The
young eye, for example, is too flat (hypermetropic)       made to focus
only on objects at a distance. Close application to print, or even to
weaving mats or folding bits of paper accurately, causes an overstrain
on the eye, which not only results in the chronic condition known as
myopia,       short-sightedness,       so common to school children, but which
acts unfavorably on the constitution and on the whole development of
the child. At the recent International Congress of School Hygiene in
London, Dr. Arthur Newsholme, medical officer of health of Brighton,
made a plea for the exclusion of children under five years of age from
schools. "During the time the child is in the infant department it has
chiefly to grow. Nutrition and sleep are its chief functions. Paints,
pencils, paper, pins, and needles should not be handled in school by
children below six." Luther Burbank, in an article on "The Training of
the Human Plant," says:

The curse of modern child life in America is overeducation,
overconfinement, overrestraint. The injury wrought to the race by
keeping too young children in school is beyond the power of any
one to estimate. The work of breaking down the nervous systems of
the children of the United States is now well under way. Every
child should have mud pies, grasshoppers, and tad-poles, wild
strawberries, acorns, and pine cones, trees to climb [121]and brooks
to wade in, sand, snakes, huckleberries, and hornets, and any
child who has been deprived of these has been deprived of the best
part of his education.

Not every child can have these blessings of the country, but every
child can be protected from the stifling of the nature instinct of
play by formal indoor "bossed" exercises, whether called games,
physical training, gymnastics, or Delsarte.




NEW YORK CITY'S SCHOOL FARM DOES NOT STIFLE NATURE INSTINCT


The answer to the protest against too early and too constant
confinement in school has always been: "Where will the child be if out
of school? Will its environment at home not work a worse injury to its
health? Will not the street injure its morals?" Because we have not
yet worked out a method of supervising the health of those children
who are not in school, it does not follow that such supervision is
impossible. Perhaps the time will come when there will be state
supervision over the health of children from birth, parents being
expected to present them once a year at school for examination by the
school physician. In this way defects can be corrected and health
measures [122]devised to build up a physique that should not break down
under the strain of school life. For children whose mothers work
during the day, and for those whose home environment is worse than
school, it might be cheaper in the long run to assign teachers to
protect them from injury while they play in a park, roof garden, or
out-of-door gymnasium. If parks and playgrounds come too slowly, why
not adopt the plan advocated by Alida S. Williams, a New York
principal, of reserving certain streets for children between the hours
of three and five, and of diverting traffic to other streets less
suitable for children's play? So great is the value       mentally,
morally, and physically       of out-of-door play that it has even been
suggested that the substitution of such play for school for all
children up to the age of ten would insure better minds and sounder
physiques at fifteen. It is generally admitted that the child who
enters school at eight rather than at six will be the gainer at
twelve. What a travesty upon education to insist upon schooling for
children because they are apt to be run over on the street, or to be
neglected at home, to shoot craps, or belong to a gang and develop bad
morals.

Educators will some day be ashamed to have made the schools the
catch-all or the court-plaster for the evils of modern industry.
Instead of pupils and mothers going to the school, enough hygiene
teachers, and play teachers, and district physicians could be employed
with the money now spent on indoor instruction to do the
house-to-house visiting urged in many chapters of this book. Such a
course of action would have an incalculable effect on the reduction of
tuberculosis, not only in making healthier physiques but by
inculcating habits of outdoor life and love of fresh air. The danger
of those contagious diseases which ravish childhood would be greatly
reduced. An ambition for physical integrity would make unnatural
living unpopular. Competition in games with children of the same
[123]physical class develops accuracy, concentration, dispatch,
resourcefulness, as much as does instruction in arithmetic. Smoking
can easily be discredited among boys trying to hit the bull's-eye. A
boy would sooner give up a glass of beer than the championship in
rifle shooting or a "home run."

The influence of the "spirit of the game" on practical life has been
described thus by New York's director of physical training, Dr. Luther
H. Gulick:

Play is the spontaneous enlistment of the entire personality in
the pursuit of some coveted end. We do not have to pursue the
goal; we wish to       it is our main desire. This is the way in which
greatest discoveries, fortunes, and poems are made. It is the way
in which we take the responsibilities and problems of life that
makes it either a deadly bore       a mere dull round of routine and
drudgery       or the most interesting and absorbing game, capable of
enlisting all the energy and enthusiasm we have to put into it.
The people who accomplish things are the people who play the game.
They let themselves go; they are not afraid. Under the stimulus
and enthusiasm of play muscles contract more powerfully and longer
than under other conditions. Blood pressure is higher in play. It
is far more interesting to play the game than to work at it. When
you work you are being driven, when you play you are doing the
driving yourself. We play not by jumping the traces of life's
responsibilities, but by going so far beyond life's compulsions as
to lose sight of the compulsion element. Play up, play up, and
play the game.






[124]

CHAPTER XIIIToC

VITALITY TESTS AND VITAL STATISTICS


Two things will disclose the strength or weakness of a bank and the
soundness or unsoundness of a nation's banking policy, namely, a
financial crisis or an expert audit. A searching audit that analyzes
each debit and each credit frequently shows that a bank is solvent
only because it is not asked to pay its debts. It continues to do
business so long as no obvious weaknesses appear, analogous to
measles, adenoids, or paralysis. A frequent disorder of banking
results from doing too big a business on too little capital, in making
too many loans for the amount of cash held ready to pay depositors
upon demand. This disorder always comes to light in a crisis       too
late. It can be discovered if looked for in advance of a crisis. Many
individuals and communities are likewise physically solvent only
because their physical resources are not put to the test. Weaknesses
that lie near the surface can be discovered before a crisis by
physical examination for individuals and sanitary supervision for
communities. Whether individuals or communities are trying to do too
much business for their health capital, whether the health reserves
will pay debts that arise in a crisis, whether we are ill or well
prepared to stand a run on our vitality, can be learned only by
carefully analyzing our health reserves. Health debits are compared
with health credits for individuals by vitality tests, for communities
by vital statistics.

Of the many vitality tests none is practicable for use in the ordinary
class room. Scientific training is just as necessary for such tests as
for discovering the quality of [125]the blood, the presence or absence of
tubercle bacilli in the sputum, diphtheria germs in throat mucus, or
typhoid germs in milk. But scientific truth, the results of scientific
tests, can be made of everyday use in all class rooms. State and
national headquarters for educators, and all large cities, can afford
to engage scientists to apply vitality tests to school children for
the sake of discovering, in advance of physical breakdown and before
outward symptoms are obvious, what curriculum, what exercise, what
study, recreation, and play periods are best suited to child
development. It will cost infinitely less to proceed this way than to
neglect children or to fit school methods to the loudest, most
persistent theory.

The ergograph is an interesting strength tester. It takes a picture
(1) of the energy exerted, and (2) of the regularity or fitfulness of
the manner in which energy is exerted. Perhaps the time will come when
science and commerce will supply every tintype photographer with an
ergograph and the knowledge to use it. Then we shall hear at summer
resorts and fairs, "Your ergograph on a postal card, three for a
quarter." We can step inside, harness our middle finger to the
ergograph, lift it up and down forty-five times in ninety seconds, and
lo! a photograph of our vitality! If we have strong muscles or good
control, the picture will be like this:




Fig. 1. Ergogram of T.R., a strong, healthy
girl, before taking 40 minutes' work in the gymnasium. Weight used,
3.5 kg. Distance lifted, 151 cm. Work done, 528.5 kg.-cm.


[126]If weak and nervous, we shall look like this before taking exercise:




Fig. 2. Ergogram of C.E., a weak and somewhat nervous girl, before taking
40 minutes' work in the gymnasium. Weight used, 3.5 kg. Distance lifted, 89 cm. Work done, 311.5 kg.-cm.


And like this after gymnasium exercise:




Fig. 3. Ergogram of C.E. after taking 40
minutes' work in the gymnasium, showing that the exercise proved very
exhausting. Weight used, 3.5 kg. Distance lifted, 55 cm.


In Chicago, two of whose girls are above photographed, the physician
was surprised to have four pupils show more strength late in the day
than in the morning. "Upon investigation it was found that the teacher
of the four pupils had been called from school, and that they had no
regular work, but had been sent to another room and employed
themselves, as they said, in having a good time." The chart on page
127 shows the effect of the noon recess and of the good time after
three o'clock.

Chicago's child-study experts concluded after examining a large number
of children:

1. In general there is a distinct relationship in children between
physical condition and intellectual capacity, the latter varying
directly as the former.

[127]2. The endurance (ergographic work) of boys is greater than that
of girls at all ages, and the difference seems to increase after
the age of nine.

3. There are certain anthropometric (body measurements)
indications which warrant a careful and thorough investigation
into the subject of coeducation in the upper grammar grades.

4. Physical condition should be made a factor in the grading of
children for school work, and especially for entrance into the
first grade.

5. The great extremes in the physical condition of pupils in the
upper grammar grades make it desirable to introduce great
elasticity into the work of these grades.

6. The classes in physical culture should be graded on a physical
instead of an intellectual basis.




Fig. 4.


To these conclusions certain others should be added, not as settled
beyond any possibility of modification, but as being fairly indicated
by these tests.

1. The pubescent period is characterized by great and rapid
changes in height, weight, strength of grip, vital capacity, and
endurance. There seems to accompany this physical activity a
corresponding intellectual and emotional activity. It therefore is
a period when broad educational influences are most needed. From
the pedagogic standpoint it is pre      minently a time for character
building.

[128]2. The pubescent period is characterized by extensive range of all
physical features of the individuals in it. Hence, although a
period fit for great activity of the mass of children, it is also
one of numerous individual exceptions to this general law. During
this period a greater per cent of individuals than usual pass
beyond the range of normal limits set by the mass. It is a time,
therefore, when the weak fail and the able forge to the front, and
hence calls for a higher degree than usual of individualization of
educational work and influence.

3. Unidexterity is a normal condition. Rapid and marked
accentuation of unidexterity is a pubescent change. On the whole,
there is a direct relationship between the degree of unidexterity
and the intellectual progress of the pupil. At any given age of
school life bright or advanced pupils tend toward accentuated
unidexterity, and dull or backward pupils tend toward
ambidexterity.... Training in ambidexterity is training contrary
to a law of child life.

4. Boys of school age at the Bridewell (reform school) are
inferior in all physical measurements to boys in the ordinary
schools, and this inferiority seems to increase with age.

5. Defects of sight and hearing are more numerous among the dull
and backward pupils. These defects should be taken into
consideration in the seating of pupils. Only by removing the
defects can the best advancement be secured.

6. The number of eye and ear defects increases during the first
years of school life. The causes of this increase should be
investigated, and, as far as possible, removed.

7. There are certain parts of the school day when pupils, on the
average, have a higher storage of energy than at other periods.
These periods should be utilized for the highest forms of
educational work.

8. The stature of boys is greater than that of girls up to the age
of eleven, when the girls surpass the boys and remain greater in
stature up to the age of fourteen. After fourteen, girls increase
in stature very slowly and very slightly, while boys continue to
increase rapidly until eighteen.

9. The weight of the girl surpasses that of the boy about a year
later than her stature surpasses his, and she maintains her
[129]superiority in weight to a later period of time than she maintains
her superiority in height.

10. In height, sitting, girls surpass boys at the same age as in
stature, namely, eleven years, but they maintain their superiority
in this measurement for one year longer than they do in stature,
which indicates that the more rapid growth of the boy at this age
is in the lower extremities rather than in the trunk.

11. Commencing at the age of thirteen, strength of grip in boys
shows a marked accentuation in its rate of increase, and this
increase continues as far as our observations extend, namely, to
the age of twenty. In girls no such great acceleration in muscular
strength at puberty occurs, and after sixteen there is little
increase in strength of grip. The well-known muscular
differentiation of the sexes practically begins at thirteen.

12. As with strength of grip, so with endurance as measured by the
ergograph; boys surpass girls at all ages, and this
differentiation becomes very marked after the age of fourteen,
after which age girls increase in strength and endurance but very
slightly, while after fourteen boys acquire almost exactly half of
the total power in these two features which they acquire in the
first twenty years of life.

13. The development of vital capacity bears a striking resemblance
to that of endurance, the curves representing the two being almost
identical.

Physiological age, according to studies made in New York City, should
be considered in grading, not only for physical culture classes but for
all high school or continuation classes. Dr. C. Ward Crampton,
assistant physical director, while examining boys in the first grade of
the High School of Commerce, noticed a greater variation in physical
advancement than in years. He kept careful watch of the educational
progress and discovered three clear divisions: (1) boys arrived at
puberty,       postpubescent; (2) boys approaching maturity,       pubescent; (3)
boys not yet approaching maturity,       prepubescent.

The work in lower grades they had all passed satisfactorily, but in
high school only the most advanced class [130]did well. Practically none
of the not-yet-maturing boys survived and few of the almost mature. In
other words, the high school course was fitted to only one of the
three classes of boys turned out of the grammar schools. The others
succumbed like hothouse azaleas at Christmas time, forced beyond their
season. Physiological age, not calendar years or grammar school
months, should determine the studies and the companions of children
after the tenth year. Physiological strength and vitality, not ability
to spell or to remember dates, should be the basis of grading for play
and study and companionship among younger children. Vitality, power to
endure physically, should be the test of work and recreation for
adults. Physicians may be so trained to follow directions issued by
experts that physical examinations will disclose the chief enemies of
vitality and the approximate limits of endurance.

Teachers may train themselves to recognize signs of fatigue in school
children and to adapt each day's, each hour's work to the endurance of
each pupil. One woman principal has written:

School programmes, after they have been based upon the laws of a
child's development, should provide for frequent change of
subject, alternating studies requiring mental concentration with
studies permitting motor activity, and arranging for very short
periods of the former. An       mic children should be relieved of all
anxiety as to the results of their efforts, and only short hours
of daylight work required of them. The disastrous consequences of
eye strain should be understood by all in charge of children who
are naturally hypermetropic. The ventilation of a class room is
far more important than its decoration or even than a high average
percentage in mathematics, and the lack of pure air is one of the
auxiliary causes of nervous exhaustion in both pupils and
teachers. Deficient motor control is a most trustworthy indication
of fatigue in children, and teachers may safely use it as a rough
index of the amount of effort to be reasonably expected of their
pupils. Facial pallor or feverish flushes are [131]both evidences of
overtasking, and either hints that fatigue has already begun. As
to unfavorable atmospheric conditions, the teacher herself will
undoubtedly realize them as soon as the children, but she should
remember that effort carried to the point of exhaustion, injurious
as it is in an adult, is yet less harmful than it is to the
developing nerve centers of the child.

Because adults at work and at play reluctantly submit themselves to
vitality tests, because few scientists are beseeching individuals to
be tested, because almost no one yearns to be tested, the promotion of
adult vitality and of community vitality can best be hastened by
demanding complete vital statistics. Industrial insurance companies
and mutual benefit societies are doing much to educate laborers
regarding the effect upon vitality of certain dangerous and unsanitary
trades, and of certain unhygienic habits, such as alcoholism and
nicotinism. Progress is slower than it need be because state boards of
health are not gathering sufficiently complete information about
causes of sickness and death. American health and factory inspection
is not even profiting, as it should, from British, German, and French
statistics. Statistics are in ill repute because the truth is not
generally known that our boasted sanitary improvements are due chiefly
to the efficient use of vital statistics by statesmen sanitarians.[7]

The vital statistics of greatest consequence are not the number of
deaths or the number of births, not even the number of deaths from
preventable diseases, but rather the number of cases of sickness from
transmissible diseases. The cost and danger to society from
preventable diseases, such as typhoid, diphtheria, scarlet fever,
measles, are imperfectly represented by the number of deaths. Medical
skill could gradually reduce death rates in the face of [132]increasing
prevalence of infectious disease. With few exceptions, only those
patients who refuse to follow instructions will die of measles,
diphtheria, or smallpox. The scarlet-fever patient who recovers and
goes to church or school while "peeling" can cause vastly more
sickness from scarlet fever than a patient who dies. Dr. W. Leslie
Mackenzie, who has recently written The Health of the School Child,
said ten years ago, while health officer of Leith:

Death is the ultimate and most severe injury that any disease can
inflict, but short of death there may be disablement, permanent or
temporary, loss of wages, loss of employment, loss of education,
increase of home labor, increase of sickness outlays, increase of
worry, anxiety and annoyance, disorganization of the household,
general impairment of social efficiency.

The best guarantee against such loss, the best protection of health,
and the most essential element of vital statistics is prompt, complete
record of cases of sickness. Statistics of sickness are confined to
sickness from transmissible diseases, because we have not yet arrived
at the point where we recognize the state's right to require
information, except when the sick person is a menace to the health of
other persons.

The annual report of a board of health should give as clear a picture
of a community's health during the past week or past quarter as the
ergograph gives of the pupils mentioned on page 126. As ragged,
rapidly shortening lines show nervousness and depleted vitality, so
charts and diagrams can be made to show the needless waste of infant
life during the summer months, the price paid for bad ventilation in
winter time, when closed windows cause the sickness-and-death line
from diphtheria and scarlet fever to shoot up from the summer level.
In cities it is now customary for health boards to report weekly the
number of deaths from transmissible diseases. Health officers will
[133]gladly furnish facts as to cases of sickness, if citizens request
them. Newspapers will gladly publish such information if any one will
take the pains to supply it. Wherever newspapers have published this
information, it quickly takes its place with the weather reports among
the news necessities. Marked changes are commented on editorially.
Children can easily be interested, as can adults, in filling out week
by week a table that will show increases and decreases in preventable
sickness due to transmissible diseases.

In cities where physicians are not compelled to notify the health
board of danger centers,       that is, of patients sick from measles,
smallpox, or diphtheria,       and in smaller communities where notices are
sent only to state boards of health, parents will find it difficult to
take a keen interest in vital statistics. But if teachers would start
at the beginning of the year to record in such a table the days of
absence from school because of transmissible disease, both they and
their pupils would discover a new interest in efficient health
administration. After a national board of [134]health is organized we may
reasonably expect that either state boards of education or state
boards of health will regularly supply teachers with reports that will
lead them to compare the vitality photographs of their own schools and
communities with the vitality photographs of other schools and other
communities working under similar conditions. Then children old enough
to study physiology and hygiene will be made to see the
happiness-giving possibilities of vitality tests and vital statistics.




VITAL STATISTICS CAN MAKE DISEASE CENTERS AS OBVIOUS AND AS OFFENSIVE AS THE SMOKE NUISANCE


Instead of discussing the theory of vital statistics, or the extent to
which statistics are now satisfactory, it would be better for us at
this point to make clear the significance of the movement for a
national fact center for matters pertaining to personal, industrial,
and community vitality. [135]Five economic reasons are assigned for
establishing a national department of health:

1. To enable society to increase the percentage of exceptional men
of each degree, many of whom are now lost through preventable
accidents, and also to increase the total population.

2. To lessen the burden of unproductive years by increasing the
average age at death.

3. To decrease the burden of death on the productive years by
increasing the age at death.

4. To lessen the cost of sickness. It is estimated that if illness
in the United States could be reduced one third, nearly
$500,000,000 would be saved annually.

5. To decrease the amounts spent on criminality that can be traced
to overcrowded, unwholesome, and unhygienic environment.

In addition to the economic gain, the establishment of a national
department of health would gradually but surely diminish much of
the misery and suffering that cannot be measured by statistics.
Sickness is a radiating center of anxiety; and often death in the
prime of life closes the gates of happiness on more than one life.
Let us not forget that the "bitter cry of the children" still goes
up to heaven, and that civilization must hear, until at last it
heeds, the imprecations of forever wasted years of millions of
lives.

If progress is to be real and lasting, it must provide whatever
bulwarks it can against death, sickness, misery, and ignorance;
and in an organization such as a national department of health,
adequately equipped,       a vast preventive machine working
ceaselessly,       an attempt at least would be made to stanch those
prodigal wastes of an old yet wastrel world.

Among the branches of the work proposed for the national bureau are
the following: infant hygiene; health education in schools;
sanitation; pure food; registration of physicians and surgeons;
registration of drugs, druggists, and drug manufacturers; registration
of institutions of public and private relief, correction, detention
and residence; organic diseases; quarantine; immigration; labor
conditions; [136]disseminating health information; research libraries and
equipment; statistical clearing house for information.

Given such a national center for health facts or vital statistics,
there will be a continuing pressure upon state, county, and city
health officers, upon physicians, hospitals, schools, and industries
to report promptly facts of birth, sickness, and death to national and
state centers able and eager to interpret the meaning of these facts
in such simple language, and with such convincing illustrations, that
the reading public will demand the prompt correction of preventable
evils.

Our tardiness in establishing a national board of health that shall do
this great educational work is due in part to the fact that American
sanitarians have frequently chosen to do things when they should
have chosen to get things done. Almost every state has its board of
health, with authority to require registration of births, deaths, and
sickness due to transmissible disease; with few exceptions the heads
of these state boards have spent their energies in abating nuisances.
In a short time they have degenerated into local scavengers, because
they have shown the public neither the meaning of the vital statistics
gathered nor its duty to support efficient health administration.

The state reports of vital statistics have not been accurate;
therefore in many states we have the anomalous situation of an
aggressive veterinary board arousing the farmer and the consumer of
milk to the necessity of protecting the health of cattle, and an
inactive, uninformed state board of health failing to protect the
health of the farmer and the consumer.

Vital statistics presume efficient health administration. An
inefficient health officer will not take the initiative in gathering
health statistics. If some one else compels him to collect vital
statistics, or furnishes him with statistics, they are as a lantern to
a blind man. Unless some one [137]also compels him to make use of them,
unless we remove the causes of transmissible or infectious diseases
and check an epidemic when we first hear of it, the collection of
information is of little social value. "Statistics" is of the same
derivation as "states" and "statesmen." Statistics have always been
distinguished from mere facts, in that statistics are instruments in
the hands of the statesman. Wherever the term "statistics" is applied
to social facts it suggests action, social control of future
contingencies, mastery of the facts whose action they chronicle. The
object of gathering social facts for analysis is not to furnish
material for future historians. They are to be used in shaping future
history. They are facts collected with a view to improving social
vitality, to raising the standard of life, and to eliminating
permanently those forces known to be destructive to health. Unless
they are to be used this way, they are of interest only to the
historical grub. No city or state can afford to erect a statistical
office to serve as a curiosity shop. Unless something is to be done to
prevent the recurrence of preventable diseases annually experienced by
your community or your school, it is not reasonable to ask the public
printer to make tables which indicate the great cost of this
preventable sickness. A tax collector cannot discharge his duties
unless he knows the address of every debtor. The police bureau cannot
protect society unless it knows the character and haunts of offenders.
A health officer cannot execute the law for the protection of
society's health unless he knows the haunts and habits of diseases.
For this he must look to vital statistics.

But the greatest service of vital statistics is the educational
influence. Health administration cannot rise far above the hygienic
standards of those who provide the means for administering sanitary
law. The taxpaying public must believe in the economy, utility, and
necessity of efficient health administration. Power and funds come
[138]from town councils and state legislatures. To convince and move these
keepers of the purse, trustworthy vital statistics are indispensable.
Information will be used for the benefit of all as soon as it is
possessed by all.

Fortunately the gathering of vital statistics is not beyond the power
of the kind of health officer that is found in small cities and in
rural communities. If years of study of mathematics and of the
statistical method were required, we should despair of obtaining light
within a century. But the facts we want are, for the most part,
common, everyday facts, easily recognizable even by laymen; for
example, births, deaths, age at death, causes of death, cases of
transmissible diseases, conditions found upon examination of children
applying for work certificates, etc. Where expert skill is required,
as at state and national headquarters, it can be found. Every layman
can train himself to use skillfully the seven ingredients of the
statistical method which it is his duty to employ, and to know when to
pay for expert analysis and advice. We can all learn to base judgment
of health needs upon the seven pillars,       desire to know, unit of
inquiry, count, comparison, percentages, classification, and summary.

public libraries and on the shelves of health officers,
public-spirited physicians, and school superintendents.

CHAPTER XIVToC

IS YOUR SCHOOL MANUFACTURING PHYSICAL DEFECTS?


Last year a conference on the physical welfare of school children was
told by a woman principal: "Of course we need physicians to examine
our children and to teach the parents, but many of us principals
believe that our school curriculum and our school environment
manufacture more physical defects in a month than all your physicians
and nurses will correct in a year." At the same meeting the physical
director of schools of New York City appealed eloquently for
"biological engineers" at school, who would test the child's strength
as building engineers are employed to test the strength of beams and
foundations.[8] As explanation for the need of the then recently
organized National School Hygiene Association, he elaborated the
proposition that school requirements and school environment damage
child health. "Ocular defects are in direct ratio to the length of
time the pupil has attended school.... A desk that is too high may
easily be the indirect agent for causing scoliosis, producing myopia
or astigmatism.... Physically examine school children by all means,
but do not fail to examine school desks."

Fifty schools in different parts of New York City were examined last
year with especial reference to the factors likely to cause or to
aggravate physical defects.[9] The results, [140]tabulated and analyzed,
prove that the woman principal was right; many schools are so built or
so conducted, many school courses are so devised or so executed, that
children are inevitably injured by the environment in which the
compulsory education law forces them to spend their formative years.




ONE OF NEW YORK CITY'S ROOF PLAYGROUNDS


Recently I noticed that our little office girl, so an       mic and nervous
when she left school that we hesitated to employ her, was becoming
rosy and spirited. The child herself explained the change: "I like it
better. I have more money to spend. I get more outdoor exercise, and
then, oh, the room is so much sunnier and there is more air and the
people are all so nice!" And these were just the necessities which
were lacking in the school from which she came. Moreover, it is a fair
commentary on the school work and the school hygiene in too many of
our towns and cities to-day. "I like it better" means that school work
is not adapted to the dominant interests of the child, that the
curriculum includes subjects remote from the needs and ambitions of
the modern school child, and fails to include certain other subjects
which it recognizes as useful and necessary, and [141]therefore finds
interesting. "I have more money to spend" means that this little girl
was able to have certain things, like a warm, pretty dress, rubbers,
or an occasional trolley ride, which she longed for and needed. "I get
more outdoor exercise" means that there was no open-air playground for
her school, that "setting up" exercises were forgotten, that recess
was taken up in rushing home, eating lunch, and rushing back again,
and that "after school" was filled up with "helping mother with the
housework." "The office is so much sunnier and I get more air"
accounts for the increase in vitality; and "the people are all so
nice," for the happy expression and initiative which the
undiscriminating discipline at school had crushed out.




BONE TUBERCULOSIS IS ONE OF THE PENALTIES FOR DRY SWEEPING AND FEATHER DUSTERS


For such unsanitary conditions crowded sections of great cities have
no apologies to make to rural districts. A wealthy suburb recently
learned that there was overcrowding in every class room, and that one
school building was so unsanitary as to be a menace to the community.
Unadjustable desks, dry sweeping, feather dusters, shiny blackboards,
harassing discipline that wrecks nerves, excessive home study and
subjects that bore, are not peculiar to great [142]cities. In a little
western town a competition between two self-governing brigades for
merit points was determined by the amount of home study; looking back
fifteen years, I can see that I was encouraging an       mic and
overambitious children to rob themselves of play, sleep, and vitality.
Many a rural school violates with impunity more laws of health than
city factories are now permitted to transgress.

After child labor is stopped, national and state child labor
committees will learn that their real interest all the time has been
child welfare, not child age, and will be able to use much of the old
literature, simply substituting for "factory" the word "school" when
condemning "hazardous occupations likely to sap [children's] nervous
energy, stunt their physical growth, blight their minds, destroy their
moral fiber, and fit them for the moral scrap heap."

Many of the evils of school environment the teacher can avert, others
the school trustee should be expected to correct. So far as unsanitary
conditions are permitted, the school accentuates home evils, whereas
it should counteract them by instilling proper health habits that will
be taken home and practiced. Questions such as were asked in Miss
North's study will prove serviceable to any one desiring to know the
probable effect of a particular school environment upon children
subject to it. Especially should principals, superintendents,
directors, and volunteer committeemen apply such tests to the public,
parochial, or private school, orphanage or reformatory for which they
may be responsible.

    a. How much is required?

    e. Is there too much close-range work?
    [150]f. Is it possible to give individual attention to individual
         needs so as to awaken individual interest?
  

3. Is follow-up work organized to enlist interest of parents, or, if
    necessary, of outside agencies in fitting a child to do that for
    which, if normal, he would be physically adapted?


By reducing the harm done by old buildings and by the traditions of
curriculum and discipline, teachers can do a great deal. Perhaps they
cannot move the windows or the desks, but they can move the children.
If they cannot insure sanitary conditions for home study, they can cut
down the home study. If the directors do not provide proper
blackboards, they can do less blackboard work. They can make children
as conscious, as afraid, and as resentful of dirty air as of dirty
teeth. They can make janitors believe that "dry sweeping" or "feather
dusting" may give them consumption, and leave most of the dirt in the
room to make work for the next day; that adjustable desks are made to
fit the child's legs and back, not the monkey wrench; that the
thermometer in the schoolroom is a safer guide to heat needed than a
boiler gauge in the basement; that fresh air heated by coal is cheaper
for the school fund than stale air heated by bodies and by bad breath.
Finally, they can make known to pupils, to parents, to principals and
superintendents, to health officials and to the public, the extent to
which school environment violates the precepts of school hygiene.

If the state requires the attendance of all children between the ages
of five and fourteen at school for five hours a day, for five days in
the week, for ten months in the year, then it should undertake to see
that the machinery it provides for the education of those children for
the greater part of the time for nine years of their lives       the
formative years of their lives       is neither injuring their health nor
retarding their full development.

If the amount of "close-range" work is rapidly manufacturing myopic
eyes; if bad ventilation, whether due to [151]faulty construction or to
faulty management, is preparing soil for the tubercle bacillus; if
children with contagious diseases are not found and segregated; if
desks are so ill adapted to children's sizes and physical needs that
they are forming crooked spines; if too many children are crowded into
one room; if lack of air and light is producing strained eyes and
malnutrition; if neither open air, space, nor time is provided for
exercise, games, and physical training; if school discipline is
adapted neither to the psychology nor the physiology of child or
teacher, then the state is depriving the child of a greater right than
the compulsory education law forces it to endure. Not only is the
right to health sacrificed to the right to education, but education
and health are both sacrificed.

In undertaking to enforce the compulsory education law, to put all
truants and child laborers in school, the state should be very sure
for its own sake that it is not depriving the child of the health on
which depends his future usefulness to the state as well as to
himself.

CHAPTER XVToC

THE TEACHER'S HEALTH


"Teachers, gentlemen, no less than pupils, have a heaven-ordained
right to work so adjusted that the highest possible physical condition
shall be maintained automatically." This declaration thundered out by
an indignant physician startled a well-meaning board of school
directors. The teacher's right to health was, of course, obvious when
once mentioned, and the directors concluded:

1. School conditions that injure child health also injure teacher
health.

2. Poor health of teacher causes poor health of pupil.

3. Poor health of pupil often causes poor health of teacher.

4. Adequate protection of children requires adequate protection of
their teachers.

5. Teachers have a right to health protection for their own sake
as well as for their children's sake.

Too little concern has hitherto been shown for the vitality of
teachers in private or public schools and colleges. Without protest,
and without notice until too late, teachers often neglect their own
health at home and at school,       recklessly overwork, undersleep, and
undernourish; ruin their eyes, their digestion, and their nerves.
School-teachers are frequently "sweated" as mercilessly as factory
operatives. The time has come to admit that a school environment which
destroys the health of the teacher is as unnecessary and reprehensible
as an army camp that spreads typhoid among a nation's defenders. A
school curriculum or a college tradition that breaks down teachers is
as inexcusable as a gun that kills the gunner when discharged.
[153]Experience everywhere else proves that periodic physical examinations
and health precautions, not essays about "happy teachers       happy
pupils," are indispensable if teachers' health rights are to be
protected.

Physical tests are imposed upon applicants for teachers' licenses by
many boards of education. In New York City about three per cent of
those examined are excluded for defects of vision, of hearing, of
probable endurance. Once a teacher, however, there is no further
physical examination,       no way of discovering physical incapacity,
nothing to prevent a teacher from exposing class after class to
pulmonary tuberculosis contracted because of overwork and
underventilation. The certainty of salary increase year by year and of
a pension after the twentieth year will bribe many a teacher to
overtax her own strength and to jeopardize her pupils' health.

Seldom do training schools apply physical tests to students who intend
to become teachers. One young girl says that before starting her
normal course she is going to the physician of the board of education
for examination, so as to avoid the experience of one of her friends,
who, after preparing to be a teacher, was rejected because of
pulmonary tuberculosis. During her normal course no examination will
be necessary. Overwork during the first year may cause pulmonary
tuberculosis, and in spite of her foresight she, too, may be rejected
four years hence.

The advantages of physical examination upon beginning and during the
courses that prepare one for a teacher are so obvious that but little
opposition will be given by prospective teachers. The disadvantages to
teacher and pupil alike of suffering from physical defects are so
obvious that every school which prepares men and women for teachers
should make registration and certification dependent upon passing a
satisfactory physical test. No school should engage a teacher who has
not good proof that she can do the [154]required work without injury to
her own or her pupils' health. Long before physicians can discover
pulmonary tuberculosis they can find depleted vitality which invites
this disease. Headaches due to eye trouble, undernourishment due to
mouth breathing, preventable indigestion, are insidious enemies that
cannot escape the physical test.

Three objections to physical tests for teachers will be urged, but
each loses its force when considered in the light of general
experience.

1. A sickly teacher is often the most efficient teacher in a school
or a county. It is true that some sickly teachers exert a powerful
influence over their pupils, but in most instances their influence and
their efficiency are due to powers that exist in spite of devitalizing
elements. Rarely does sickness itself bring power. It must be admitted
that many a man is teaching who would be practicing law had his health
permitted it. Many a woman's soul is shorn of its self-consciousness
by suffering. But even in these exceptional instances it is probable
that children are paying too dearly for benefits directly or
indirectly traceable to defects that physical tests would exclude.

2. There are not enough healthy candidates to supply our schools.
This is begging the question. In fact, no one knows it is true. On the
contrary, it is probable that the teacher's opportunity will make even
a stronger appeal to competent men and women after physical soundness
and vitality are made conditions of teaching,       after we all believe
what leading educators now believe, that the highest fulfillment of
human possibilities requires a normal, sound body, abounding in
vitality.

3. Examination by a physician, especially if a social acquaintance,
is an unnecessary embarrassment. The false modesty that makes
physical examination unwelcome to many adults, men as well as women,
is easily overcome when the advantages of such examination are
understood. [155]It is likewise easy to prove to a teacher that the loss
of time required in having the examination is infinitesimal compared
with the loss of time due to ignoring physical needs. The programme
for school hygiene outlined in Chapter XXVII, Part IV, assumes that
state and county superintendents will provide for the examination of
teachers as well as of pupils.




TEACHERS WILL PREFER PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS TO FORCED VACATIONS
Boston Society for Relief and Study of Tuberculosis


Because the health of others furnishes a stronger motive for
preventive hygiene than our own health, it is probable that the
general examination of teachers will come first as the result of a
general conviction that unhealthy teachers positively injure the
health of pupils and retard their mental development. Children at
school age are so susceptible and imitative that their future habits
of body and mind, their dispositions, their very voices and
expressions, are influenced by those of their teachers. Experts in
child [156]study say that a child's vocal chords respond to the voices and
noise about him before he is able to speak, so that the tones of his
voice are determined before he is able to express them. This influence
is also marked when the child begins to talk. Babies and young
children instinctively do what adults learn not to do only by
study,       follow the pitch of others' voices. Can we then overestimate
the effect upon pupils' character of teachers who radiate vitality?

The character and fitness, aside from scholarship, of applicants for
teachers' licenses are now subjected by the board of examiners of New
York City to the following tests:

1. Moral character as indicated in the record of the applicant as
a student or teacher or in other occupation, or as a participant
in an examination.

2. Physical fitness for the position sought, reference being had
here to all questions of physical fitness other than those covered
in a physician's report as to "sound health."

3. Satisfactory quality and use of voice.

4. Personal bearing, cleanliness, appearance, manners.

5. Self-command and power to win and hold the respect of teachers,
school authorities, and the community.

6. Capacity for school discipline, power to maintain order and to
secure the willing obedience and the friendship of pupils.

7. Business or executive ability,       power to comprehend and carry
out and to accomplish prescribed work, school management as
relating to adjustment of desks, lighting, heating, ventilation,
cleanliness, and attractiveness of schoolroom.

8. Capacity for supervision, for organization and administration
of a school, and for the instructing, assisting, and inspiring of
teachers.

These tests probably exclude few applicants who should be admitted.
Experience proves that they include many who, for their own sake and
for children's sake, should be rejected. The moral character, physical
fitness, quality of voice, personal bearing, self-command, executive
ability, [157]capacity for supervision, are qualities that are modified by
conditions. The voice that is satisfactory in conference with an
examiner may be strident and irritating when the teacher is impatient
or is trying to overcome street noises. On parade applicants are
equally cleanly; this cannot be said of teachers in the service,
coming from different home environments. Self-command is much easier
in one school than in another. Physical fitness in a girl of twenty
may, during one short year of teaching, give way to physical
unfitness. Therefore the need for periodic tests by principal,
superintendent, and school board, to determine the continuing
fitness of a teacher to do the special task assigned to her, based
upon physical evidence of her own vitality and of her favorable
influence upon her pupils' health and enjoyment of school life.
Shattered nerves due to overwork may explain a teacher's shouting:
"You are a dirty boy. Your mother is a dirty woman and keeps a dirty
store where no decent people will go to buy." A physical examination
of that unfortunate teacher would probably show that she ought to be
on leave of absence, rather than, by her overwork and loss of control,
to cause the boys of her class to feel what one of them expressed:
"Grandmother, if she spoke so of my mother I would strike her."

Just as there should be a central bureau to count and correct the open
mouths and closed minds that clog the little old red schoolhouse of
the country, so a central bureau should discover in the city teacher
as well as in the country teacher the ailments more serious than
tuberculosis that pass from teacher to pupil; slovenliness, ugly
temper, frowning, crossness, lack of ambition, cynicism,       these should
be blackballed as well as consumption, contagious morphine habit, and
contagious skin disease. Crooked thinking by teacher leads to crooked
thinking by pupil. Disregard of health laws by teacher encourages
unhygienic living by pupils. A man whose fingers are yellow, nerves
[158]shaky, eyes unsteady, and mind alternately sleepy and hilarious from
cigarettes, cannot convey pictures of normal, healthy physical living,
nor can he successfully teach the moral and social evils of
nicotinism. Both teacher and pupil have a right to the periodic
physical examination of teachers that will give timely warning of
attention needed. Until there is some system for giving this right to
all teachers in private, parochial, charitable, and public schools, we
shall produce many nervous, acrid, and physically threadbare teachers,
where we should have only teachers who inspire their pupils with a
passion for health by the example of a good complexion, sprightly
step, bounding vitality, and forceful personality born of hygienic
living.

PART III. CO      PERATION IN MEETING HEALTH OBLIGATIONS



CHAPTER XVIToC

EUROPEAN REMEDIES: DOING THINGS AT SCHOOL


Recently I traveled five hundred miles to address an audience on
methods of fitting health remedies to local health needs. I told of
certain dangers to be avoided, of results that had always followed
certain remedies, of motives to be sought and used, of community ends
to seek. Not knowing the local situation, I could not tell them
exactly what to do next, or how or with whom to do it; not seeing the
patient or his symptoms, I did not diagnose the disease or prescribe
medicine. Several members of the audience who were particularly
anxious to start a new organization on a metropolitan model were
disappointed because they were told, not just how to organize, but
rather how to find out what sort of organization their town needed.
They were right in believing that it was easier to copy on paper a
plan tried somewhere else, than to think out a plan for themselves.
They had forgotten for the time being their many previous
disappointments due to copying without question some plan of social
work, just as they copy Paris or New York fashions. They had not
expected to leave this meeting with the conviction that while the
ends of sanitary administration may be the same in ten communities,
health machinery should fit a particular community like a
tailor-made suit.

[160]American-like, they had a mania for organization. I once heard an aged
kindergartner       the savant of an isolated German village       describe my
fellow-Americans as follows: "Every American belongs to some
organization. The total abstainers are organized, the brewers are
organized, the teachers are organized, the parents are organized, the
young people and even the juniors are organized. Finally, those who
belong to no organization go off by themselves and organize a society
of the unorganized." Love of organization and love of copying have
given us Americans a feverish desire for what we see or read about in
Europe. When we talk about our European remedies we try to make
ourselves believe that we are broad-minded and want to learn from
others' experience. In a large number of cases our impatient demand
for European remedies is similar to the schoolboy's desire to show off
the manners, the slang, or the clothes picked up on his first visit
away from home. With many travelers and readers European remedies or
European ways are souvenirs of a pleasant visit, to be described like
a collection of postal cards, a curious umbrella, a cane associated
with Alpine climbing, or a stolen hymnal from an historic cathedral.

Experience proves, however, that just as Roman walls and Norman
castles look out of place in New York and Kansas, so European laws and
European remedies are too frequently misfits when tried by American
schools, hospitals, or city governments. Yesterday a Canadian
clergyman, after preaching an eloquent sermon, met a professional
beggar on the street in New York City and emptied his purse       of
Canadian money! Quite like this is the enthusiastic demand of the
tourist who has seen or read about "the way it's done in Germany." The
trouble is that European remedies are valued like ruins, by their
power to interest, by their antiquity or picturesqueness, or, like the
beggar, by their power to stimulate temporary emotion. [161]But we do not
sleep in ruins, go to church regularly in thirteenth-century abbeys,
or live under the remedies that fire our imagination. We do not
therefore see their everyday, practical-result side.

The souvenir value of European remedies is due to the assumption that
no better way was open to the European, and that the remedy actually
does what it is intended to do. Because free meals are given at school
to cure and prevent undernourishment, it is taken for granted that
undernourishment stops when free meals are introduced; therefore
America must have free meals. Because it is made compulsory in a
charming Italian village for every child to eat the free school meal,
it is taken for granted that the children of that village have no
physical defects; therefore let Kansas City, Seattle, and Boston
introduce compulsory free meals. But when one goes to Europe to see
exactly how those much-advertised, eulogized remedies operate from day
to day, it is often necessary to write, as did a great American
sanitarian recently, of health administration in foreign cities
continually held up as models to American cities: "In spite of the
rules and theories over here, the patient has better care in New York
City."

We have been asked of late to copy several very attractive European
remedies for the physiological ills of school children, and for the
physical deficiencies of the next generation of adults: breakfasts or
lunches, or both, at school for all children, rich as well as poor,
whether they want school nourishment or not; school meals for the poor
only; school meals to be given the poor, but to be bought by those who
can afford the small sum required; free eyeglasses for the poor, for
poor and well-to-do, for those who wish them, for those who need them
whether they want to wear eyeglasses or not; free dental care; free
surgical treatment; free rides and outings during summer and winter;
country children to visit the metropolis, city children to visit
country [162]and village; free treatment in the country of all children
whose parents are consumptives; free rides on street cars to and from
school; city-owned street railways that will prevent congestion by
making the country accessible; city-built tenements to prevent
overcrowding, dark rooms, insufficient air and light; free coal, free
clothes, free rent for those whose parents are unable to protect them
properly against hunger and cold. Every one of these remedies is
attractive. Every one is being tried somewhere, and can be justified
on emotional, economic, and educational grounds, if we think only of
its purpose. Let us view them with the eyes of their advocates.

Would it not be nice for country children to know that toward the end
of the school year they would be given an excursion to the largest
city of their state, to its slums, its factories, parks, and art
galleries? They would grow up more intelligent about geography. They
would read history, politics, sociology, and civil government with
greater interest. They would have less contracted sympathies. They
might even decide that they would rather live their life in the
spacious country than in the crowded, rushing city.

City children, on the other hand, would reap worlds of physical
benefit and untold inspiration from periods of recreation and study in
the country, with its quiet, its greens and bronzes and yellows, its
birds and animals, its sky that sits like a dome on the earth, its
hopefulness. Winter sleigh rides and coasting would give new vigor and
ambition. Why spend so much on teaching physiology, geography, and
nature study, if in the end we fail to send the child where alone
nature and hygiene tell their story? Why tax ourselves to teach
history and sociology and commercial geography out of books when
excursions to the city and country will paint pictures on the mind
that can never be erased? What more attractive or more reasonable than
appetizing, warm meals, or cool salads and drinks for [163]the boys and
girls who carry their little dinner pails and baskets down the long
road where everything runs together in summer and everything freezes
in winter? One needs little imagination to see the "smile that won't
come off," health, punctuality, and school interest resulting from the
school meal.

Again, if children must have teeth filled and pulled, eyes tested and
fitted for glasses, adenoids and enlarged tonsils removed, surely the
school environment offers the least affrighting spot for the tragedy.
Thence goblins long ago fled. There courage, real or feigned, is
brought to the surface by the anxious, critical, competitive interest
of one's peers.




A SOUTH IRELAND ARGUMENT FOR "DOING THINGS"


The economic defense of these remedies is many-sided. An English
drummer once instructed me during a railroad journey from southern to
northern Ireland. As we entered the fertile fields of Lord Dunraven's
estate near Athlone, I expressed sympathy for other countries
impoverished of soil, of wealth, and of thrift. My instructor replied:
"It would pay the government to bring them all to this land free once
a year, just to show them what they are missing." That his idea of an
investment is sound has been proved by railroads and land companies
and even by states, who give away excursions to entice settlers and
buyers. Ambition at almost any cost is cheaper than indifference to
opportunity. It would be cheaper for our American taxpayer to send
school children to city and country than to pay the penalty for having
a large number of citizens with narrow interests, unconscious of the
struggles and joys of [164]their co-citizens. Free meals, free books, free
rides, free eyeglasses, are cheaper than free instruction for the
second, third, and sixth terms in studies not passed because of
physical defects,       infinitely cheaper than jails and almshouses,
truant officers and courthouses.

The demoralizing results of giving "something for nothing" did not
follow free schooling or free text-books. Perhaps they would not
follow the free remedies that we are asked to copy from Europe. In
fact, the word "free" is the wrong word. These remedies rather require
co      peration of parent with parent. It has demoralized nobody because
the streets are cleaned by all of us, country roads made by the
township, police paid for by taxes and not by volunteer subscription.

The man whose children do not need glasses or nourishment or operation
for adenoids would find it cheaper to pay for European remedies than
for the useless schooling of boys unable to get along in school
because of removable defects. An unruly, uninterested boy sitting
beside your boy in public school, a pampered, overfed, undisciplined
child sitting beside yours at private school, is taxing you without
your consent and doing your child injury that may prove irreparable.

It costs $2.50 to furnish a child with eyeglasses. It costs $25 to $50
to give that child a year's schooling. If the child cannot see right
and fails in his studies, we have lost a good investment and, after
one year so lost, we are out $22.50. In two years we have lost $47.50.
But, what is more serious, we have discouraged that boy. Used to
failure in school, his mind turns to other things. He is made to think
that it is useless for him to try for first place. Perhaps he can play
ball, and excels. He chooses a career of ball playing. Valuable years
are lost.

Initiative and competition are not interrupted any more by free
eyeglasses and free operation for adenoids than by [165]free schooling.
There is only one place in the world where there is less competition
or less struggle than among the ignorant, and that is among the
ignorant and unwell. The boy who can't see the blackboard, who can't
learn to spell, who can't breathe through his nose, and can't be
interested, doesn't compete at all with the bright, healthy boy.
Remove the adenoids, give glasses, make interest possible, and fitness
to survive takes a higher level because larger numbers become fit to
survive.

Professor Patten says that it is easier to support in the almshouse
than in competitive industry a man who cannot earn more than $1.50 a
day. The question, therefore, regarding European remedies is not, To
what general theory do they belong? but, What will they accomplish?
How do they compare with other remedies of which we know?






[166]

CHAPTER XVIIToC

AMERICAN REMEDIES: GETTING THINGS DONE


In New York City there is a committee called the Committee on the
Physical Welfare of School Children. The word "welfare" was used
rather than "condition" because the committee proposed to use whatever
facts it could gather for the improvement of home and school
conditions prejudicial to child welfare. The following programme was
adopted:

1. Study of the physical welfare of school children.

a. Examination of board of health records of children needing
medical, dental, or ocular care, and better nourishment.

b. Home visitation of such children, in order to ascertain
whether their need arises from deficient income or from
other causes.

c. Effort to secure proper treatment, either from parents or
from free clinics or other established agencies.

d. Effort to secure proper physical surroundings of children
while at school       playgrounds, baths, etc.

2. Effort to secure establishment of such a system of school
records and reports as will disclose automatically significant
school facts,       e.g. regarding backward pupils, truancy,
regularity of attendance, registered children not attending,
sickness, physical defects, etc.

3. Effort to utilize available information regarding school needs
so as to stimulate public interest and thus aid in securing
adequate appropriations to meet school needs.

The committee grew out of the discussion, in the year 1905, of the
following proposition: To insure a race physically able to receive
our vaunted free education, we must provide at school free meals, free
eyeglasses, free medical [167]and dental care. Thanks to the
superintendent of schools of New York City, to Robert Hunter's
Poverty, to John Spargo's Bitter Cry of the Children, hundreds of
thousands of American citizens were made to realize for the first time
that a large proportion of our school children are in serious need of
medical, dental, or ocular attention, or of better nourishment.

Because physicians, dentists, oculists, hospitals, dispensaries,
relief agencies, had seemingly been unconscious of this serious state
of affairs, they had no definite, constructive remedy to propose.
Their unpreparedness served to strengthen the arguments for the
European method of doing things. France, Germany, Italy, England,
had found it necessary to do things at school. Arguing from their
experience, it was only a matter of time when American cities must
follow their example. Why not, therefore, begin at once to deal
radically with the situation and give school meals, school eyeglasses,
etc.? Those who organized the Committee on the Physical Welfare of
School Children realized the danger of trying to settle so great a
question with the little definite information then available. If
doing things at school were to be adopted as a principle and
logically carried out, vast sums must be added to the present cost of
the public school system. Complications would arise with private and
parochial schools, whose children might have quite as serious physical
defects, even though not educated by public funds. It would be
difficult to obtain proper rooms for medical and dental treatment and
meals, and perhaps still more difficult to insure proper food, skilled
oculists, dentists, surgeons, and physicians. No one was clear as to
how the problem was to be solved by small cities and rural districts,
whose needy children are no less entitled to public aid simply because
their numbers are smaller. Great as were the difficulties, however,
the committee saw that difficulties are in themselves no reason for
not doing the right thing. On the [168]other hand, if doing things at
school is wrong, if school meals fail to correct and remove physical
defects, great social and educational wrong would result from New
York's setting an example that would not only misdirect funds and
attention in that city, but would undoubtedly lead other cities to
move in the wrong direction. Right could be hastened, wrong could be
prevented more effectually by facts than by any amount of theory.
School meals had been made a political issue in England. The arguments
supporting them were stronger than any possible arguments against
them, except proof that they would be less effective in helping
children than other means that might be proposed. If the American
people must choose between sickly, unteachable, dull children without
school meals, on the one hand, and bright, teachable, healthy children
plus school meals, on the other hand, they will not hesitate because
of expense or eighteenth-century objections to "socialism."

During one year of investigation and of getting things done the
committee has prepared three studies for publication: (1) a report on
the home conditions of fourteen hundred school children of different
nationalities, found by school physicians to have defects of vision,
breathing, hearing, teeth, and nourishment; (2) an examination of
fifty schools       curriculum, buildings, home-study requirements, play
space and playtime, physical culture       in an attempt to answer the
question, How far does school environment directly cause or aggravate
physical defects of school children; (3) a comparative study of
methods now employed in a hundred cities to record, classify, and make
public significant school facts.

The results of the first year's work prove conclusively that physical
defects are not caused solely by the inability of parents to pay for
proper food. Among the twenty significant facts reported by the
committee are the following:

1. Physical defects found in public schools are, for the most[169]
part, such as frequently occur in wealthy families and do not of
themselves presume as the cause insufficient income. Of 145
reported for malnutrition, 44 were from families having over $20
weekly.

2. Few of the defects can be corrected by nourishment alone;
plenty of fresh air, outside nourishment at school, or extra
nourishment at home will not entirely counteract the influences of
bad ventilation and bad light in school buildings. Country
children have adenoids, bad teeth, and malnutrition. Plenty of
food will not prevent bad teeth and bad ventilation from causing
adenoids, enlarged tonsils, and malnutrition.

3. Children whose parents have long lived in the United States
need attention quite as much as the recent immigrant.

4. A large part of the defects reported could be produced by
conditions due directly to neglect of teeth.

From twenty such statements of fact and from its experience in
getting things done for one year, the committee drew fifteen
practical conclusions, among which the following deserve emphasis
here:

1. The only new thing about the physical defects of school
children is not their existence, but our recent awakening to their
existence, their prevalence, their seriousness if neglected, and
their cost to individual children, to school progress, to
industry, and to social welfare.

2. Physical deterioration, applied to America's school children,
is a misnomer. No evidence whatever has been given that the
percentage of children suffering from physical defects in 1907 is
greater than the percentage of children suffering from such
defects in 1857. On the contrary, the small proportion of defects
that are not easily removable, as well as a vast amount of
evidence from medical experience and vital statistics, indicates
that, if a comparison were possible, the children of 1907 would be
found to have sounder bodies and fewer defects than their
predecessors of fifty years ago. If there is an exception to this
statement, it is probably defects of vision, with regard to which
school authorities and oculists seem to agree that confinement in
school for longer [170]hours and more constant application under
unfavorable lighting conditions have caused a marked increase.
Positive evidence as to tendencies will be easily obtained after
thorough physical examination has been carried on for a
generation.

3. The effect of massing facts as to physical defects of school
children should not be to cause alarm, but to stimulate remedial
and preventive measures, to invoke congratulations and aggressive
optimism, not doleful pessimism and palliative measures born of
despair.




THE DARK-HALL EVIL IS HERE INDEXED BY ADENOIDS.


4. The causes of physical defects are not confined to "marginal"
incomes, but, while more apt to be present in families having
small incomes, are found among all incomes wherever there exist
bad ventilation, insufficient outdoor exercise, improper light,
irregular eating, overeating, improper as well as insufficient
food, lack of medical, dental, and ocular attention.

5. Whatever may be said of free meals at school as a means of
insuring punctual attendance or better attention, they are
inadequate to correct physical conditions that home and street
environment produce.

6. To remove physical defects, causal conditions among all income
classes should be treated, and not merely symptoms revealed at
school by children of the so-called poor.

7. Parents can and will correct the greater part of the defects
discovered by the physical examination of school children, if
shown what steps to take. Where parents refuse to do what can be
proved to be within their power, and where existing laws are
nonenforced or inadequate, the segregation of children having
physical defects in special classes might prove an effective
stimulus to obstinate parents.

8. Where parents are unable to pay for medical, dental, and ocular
care and proper nourishment, private philanthropy must either
provide adequately or expect the state to step in and assume the
duty.

9. Private dispensaries and hospitals must either arrange
themselves to treat cases and to educate communities as to the
importance of detecting and correcting physical defects, or must
expect the state to provide hospital and dispensary care. Until
private hospitals and dispensaries take steps to prevent people
[171]with adequate incomes from imposing upon them for free treatment,
it is difficult to make out a case against free eyeglasses and
free meals for school children.

10. Either private philanthropy or the state must take steps to
procure more dental clinics and an educational policy on the part
of the dental profession that will prevent the exploitation of the
poor when dental care is needed.

11. The United States Bureau of Education is the only agency with
authority and equipment adequate to secure from all sections of
the country proper attention to the subject. Nothing in the world
can prevent free meals, free eyeglasses, free medical care, free
material relief at school, unless educational use is made by each
community of the facts learned through physical examination to
correct home, school, and street conditions that produce and
aggravate physical defects. The national bureau can mass
information in such a way as to convince budget makers in city,
county, and state to vote gladly the funds necessary to promote
the physical welfare of school children.

How the committee got things done is often referred to. There is
something about a request for co      peration, whether by schools or by
any other agency, that enlists the interest of those whose help is
asked. The reason is not that people are flattered by requests to
serve on committees, or that human nature finds it difficult to be
unfriendly or unkind. On the contrary, men and women are by nature
social; there is more joy in giving than in withholding, in working
with others than in working alone. Men and women, official and
volunteer agencies, will co      perate with school-teachers when invited,
for the same reason and [172]with the same readiness that ninety-nine
farmers out of a hundred, on the prairie or in the mountain, will
welcome a request for food and lodging.




WHERE "GETTING THINGS DONE" IS POSSIBLE BUT "DOING THINGS" INEFFECTIVE


Mothers will naturally take a greater interest in the welfare of their
children if held responsible for proper food and proper home
surroundings than if not reminded of their responsibility. In New York
City a woman district superintendent of schools, Miss Julia Richman,
has organized a unique "social settlement." She and several
school-teachers occupy a house, known as "The Teachers' House." This
is their residence. Here they are subject to neither intrusion nor
importunity; no clubs or classes are held here; visitors are treated
as guests, not as beneficiaries. The purpose these teachers have in
living together is to work out the methods of interesting private and
official leaders in community needs disclosed at school.

[173]Where clubs and social gatherings are held in school buildings, it is
not unusual for a thousand mothers, recent immigrants, to meet
together in one hall to hear talks on the care of children. Thus,
instead of principals, teachers, and physicians taking the place of
mothers (which they nowhere have succeeded in doing), they do succeed
in harnessing mothers to the school programme. It may take two, three,
or ten visits to get a particular mother to do the necessary thing for
her child, but when once convinced and once inspired to do that thing,
she will go on day in and day out doing the right thing for that child
and for all others in her home. It may take a year to convert a police
magistrate whose sympathy for delinquent parents and truant children
is an active promoter of disorder; but a magistrate convinced,
efficient, and interested is worth a hundred volunteer visitors. To
get things done in this way for a hundred thousand children costs less
in time and money than to do the necessary things for one thousand
children.






[174]

CHAPTER XVIIIToC

CO      PERATION WITH DISPENSARIES AND CHILD-SAVING AGENCIES


Scientists agree that the human brain is superior to the animal brain,
not because it is heavier, but because it is finer and better supplied
with nerves. As one writer has said, the human brain is better
"wired," has better organized "centrals." A poor system of centrals
will spoil a telephone service, no matter how many wires it provides.
An independent wire is of little use, because it will not reach the
person desired at the other end. The ideal system is that which almost
instantly connects two persons, no matter how far away or how many
other people are talking at the same time on other wires.




ADEQUATE RELIEF RECOGNIZES THE FAMILY AS THE UNIT


The school that tries to do everything for its pupils without using
other existing agencies for helping children[10] will be like the man
who refuses to connect his telephone with a central switch board, or
like a bank that will not use the central clearing house. As one
telephone center can enable scores of people to talk at once, and as
one clearing house can make one check pay fifty debts, so hospital and
relief agencies enable a teacher who employs "central" to help several
times as many children as she alone can help.

It seems easier for a teacher to give twenty-five cents to a child in
distress than to see that the cause of the misery is removed. In New
York City there are over five hundred school principals, under them
are over fifteen thousand [175]teachers, and the average attendance of
children is about six hundred thousand, representing one hundred and
fifty thousand homes. If teachers give only to those children who ask
for help, many will be neglected. In certain sections of the city
principals have combined to establish a relief fund to be given out to
children who need food, clothes, shoes, etc. One principal had to stop
replacing stolen overcoats because, when it was known that he had a
fund, an astonishingly large number of overcoats disappeared. At
Poughkeepsie school children get up parties, amateur vaudeville,
minstrel shows, basket picnics, to obtain food and clothing for
children in distress. They are, of course, unable to help parents or
children not in school. Of this method a district superintendent in
New York said to his teachers and principals: "For thirty-two years I
have been working in the schools of this district. I have given food
and shoes to thousands of children. I know that however great our
interest in a particular child when it comes to us with trouble at
home, our duty as teachers prevents us from following our gift into
the home and learning the cause of the child's trouble. This last
winter we have made an experiment in using a central society, which
makes it a business to find out what the family needs, to supply
necessaries, country board, medicine, etc. We now know that we can put
a slip of paper with the [176]name and address of the child into a general
hopper and it will come out eyeglasses, food, rent, vacation parties,
as the need may be."

Relief at home through existing agencies was brought about by the
distribution of cards like those on opposite page, which offer winter
and summer co      peration.




FRESH-AIR AGENCIES LIKE SEA BREEZE PREFER TO AID CHILDREN IN ORDER OF NEED


When these cards were first distributed several teachers went from
room to room, asking children who needed help to raise the hand. In
many cases parents were very angry that their children should have
asked for help. But help given in instances like the following soon
proved to teachers that they could afford the time necessary to notice
children who appeared neglected, when so much good would ensue:

The father is sick and unable to work. They cannot get clothes for
the children, who are not attending school on that account.
Children were provided with shoes and clothes.

November 30, 1907, a school principal reported that six children
in one family needed underwear. A visitor discovered that one of
the boys who had the reputation of being unruly and light-fingered
also had adenoids. He was taken to a hospital for operation, and
was later interested in his school work.

[177]




[178]A little girl was unruly and truant. No attempt was made to keep
her at school, but she was reported to the Committee on the
Physical Welfare of School Children. The parents could not control
her. The girl was taken for examination by a specialist and found
to be feeble-minded. Later she was sent to a custodial institute.

Another little girl was nine years old, but could not talk. A
University Extension Society worker found that she was not kept at
school because it was too much trouble. The child was taken to a
physician who operated and corrected the tongue-tie.

A girl of twelve said she must stay home to "help mother." The
mother was found to be a janitress, temporarily incapacitated by
rheumatism. A substitute was provided until the mother was well,
and all the children were properly clad for school.

After the adenoid operations in a New York school that occasioned
the East Side riots of 1906, the physicians and principals who had
persuaded parents to permit the operations were fearful lest the
summer in unsanitary surroundings might make the demonstration
less complete. Over forty children in three parties were sent away
for the summer, where they had wholesome food and all the milk
they could drink and fresh air day and night. When they returned
in the fall the principal wrote: "The improvement in each
individual is simply marvelous. We shall try to continue this
condition and shall constantly urge the parents to keep up the
good work by means of proper food and fresh air."

In none of these instances could the teachers have accomplished equal
results for the individual children or for the families without
neglecting school duties. By informing other agencies as to children's
needs, teachers started movements that have since helped practically
every school child in New York City. Dispensaries are setting aside
separate hours for school children; fresh-air agencies are giving
preference to children found by teachers or school physicians to be in
physical need; relief agencies are making "rush orders" of every note
from teachers; the health board is more active because volunteer
agencies [179]have added their voice to that of teacher and health officer
in demanding adequate funds for physical examination of school
children.




"CENTRAL" FOUND THE MOTHER SICK IN A HOSPITAL, THE
FATHER KILLED       THE CHILDREN WERE BOARDED IN THE COUNTRY UNTIL THE MOTHER RECOVERED


Co      peration is at present easier in New York than in any other city.
Charitable societies, hospitals, dispensaries, are probably more
keenly alive to their responsibilities and are at least more apt to
have acquired the habit of co      peration when asked. Yet even here I
have been told repeatedly by teachers: "If we have to wait for that
hospital or that charitable society, our children will go barefoot."
In small communities where hospital and relief agencies are for
emergencies only and generally inactive, it seems that the first thing
to do is to ask some friends to establish a small relief fund, just as
it is easier to give a child a five-cent [180]meal than to teach its
mother how to prepare its food. But the school-teacher will find that
it takes very much less energy to arouse the relief society than to
maintain her own relief work. In fact, in many cities nothing could do
more to strengthen hospitals and charitable societies than to put them
in touch with the needs of school children. For a principal to make
known the fact that school children are neglected will help the
charitable society and hospital to get the funds necessary to do their
part better than they are now doing it and better than the school
could ever do it. Finally, one reason for a breakdown of charitable
societies is not their own inadequacy, but rather the failure of the
[181]school and church to make use of an agency better equipped than
themselves to give material relief. The teacher sees the child every
day, while the relief society will never see it and has no reason to
see it until some one calls attention to it. The very first step, and
an indispensable one in relief policy, is for teachers to be on the
lookout for children not adequately provided for, and then have the
physical evidence discovered at school followed to the home for the
cause of the child's distress.




HOME-TO-HOME INSTRUCTION IN COOKINGAn       mic condition of child due to bad cooking, not to lack of income


Co      peration removes the cause of distress; doing may aggravate it.
Teachers would do well to draw up for themselves a chart which will
show exactly what part of the community's work can be best done by
their school. On the following page is charted the social work now
being conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston. So far
as agencies exist to deal with any individual or family problem coming
into the social-work square, the hospital aims to utilize that agency.
Its own direct dealing with neurasthenics, with hygiene education,
with sexual deviates, is primarily for the purpose of giving adequate
treatment to the needy, and secondarily to demonstrate how adequate
treatment should be organized for the community. Please to note that
governmental agencies are not mentioned in Dr. Cabot's chart. This
does not mean that he would not emphasize the importance of those
agencies, but that up to the present time, for the particular cases
dealt with in his clinics, governmental agencies can be reached most
effectively through the private charitable agencies in the reference
square. So the teacher will frequently find that the relief bureau,
children's society, public education association, or church can get
better results for her pupils from public health and correctional
agencies than can she by writing directly.

[182]




[183]In country districts no plan has yet been worked out for adequate
relief. Fortunately, however, the distress is generally of such a
kind, and the teacher so well acquainted with all the parents of her
district, that it will not be difficult to procure such attention as
is necessary. Country schools should be furnished by county and state
superintendents with clear directions for getting the treatment
afforded in the immediate vicinity. Where teachers are alone in seeing
the need for co      peration they can quickly interest young and old,
physicians, dentists, pastors, health officers, in home visiting,
street cleaning, nursing, helping truants, needed changes of
curriculum, etc. Getting things done is easy because it is human to
love the doing; getting things done is doing of the highest order.

social treatment is presented in Edward T. Devine's Principles of
Relief, and in Homer Folks's Care of Dependent, Defective, and
Delinquent Children.






[184]

CHAPTER XIXToC

SCHOOL SURGERY AND RELIEF OBJECTIONABLE, IF AVOIDABLE


The popular arguments for free meals, free relief, free medical
treatment at school, are based upon the assumption that there are but
two ways to travel, one leading to a physically sound, moral,
teachable child, the other to an undernourished, subnormal, backward
child. They tell us we must choose either school meals or
malnutrition, school eyeglasses or defective vision, free coal or
freezing poor, free rent or people sleeping on the streets, free
dental clinics at school or indigestion and undernourishment, free
operation at school for adenoids or backward, discouraged pupils. If
there is no other alternative than neglect of the child, if we must
either waste fifty dollars in giving a child education that he is
physically unable to take, or pay two, three, four, or even fifty
dollars to fit him for that education, the American people will not
hesitate. Whether there are other roads to healthy children, whether
it is cheaper and better for the school to see that outside agencies
prepare the child for education rather than itself to take the place
of those outside agencies, is a question of fact, not of theory.

Facts prove, as we have seen, that there is more than one way to
prevent malnutrition. Parents can be taught to attend to their
children; hospitals and dispensaries will furnish eyeglasses where
parents are unable to pay for them; charitable societies will go back
of the need for eyeglasses to the conditions that produce that need
and will do vastly more for the child than can eyeglasses alone. If
[185]parents, hospitals, dispensaries, and charitable societies will attend
to children's needs, then relief at school is unnecessary, even though
it may seem desirable.

The objection to school surgery should be clearly before us, so that
we can judge of the two methods that are open to us,       treatment at
school vs. treatment away from school.

Society is so organized that the treatment of serious physical defects
and social needs at school would upset the machinery a very great
deal. For the school to do for its children whatever they may need
during their school years will require the setting up of a miniature
society in every school building or under every school board. Unless
schools are to equip themselves to take the place of all existing
facilities for relief and surgery, children would not be so well taken
care of as at present. It should not be forgotten that the physical
welfare of the school child is the most accurate index to the physical
needs of the community. After all, the child lives for six important
years before coming to the school and leaves at the early age of
fourteen or fifteen; even while attending school it sleeps at home and
is influenced more by home and street standards of ventilation,
cleanliness, and morality than by conditions at school. It would seem,
therefore, the wider use of the school's influence to use the child's
appeal to strengthen every agency having to do with community health,
rather than to concentrate upon the child himself. If babies were
properly cared for up to the sixth year, the protection of the school
child's health would be infinitely easier. To take our eyes from the
child not yet in school and from the child just out of school is to
make the mistake that so many advocates of the child labor movement
have made of going whither and only so far as our interest leads us
and of not continuing until our work is accomplished.




"DOING THINGS" THROUGH MODEL TENEMENTS


Do we want to make of our schools miniature hospitals, dispensaries,
relief bureaus, parks? Or shall we use the [186]momentum of society's
interest in the school child to put within the reach of every school
building adequate hospitals, dispensaries, relief centers, and parks
for school child and adult? Shall every little school have its
library, or shall the child be taught at school how to use the same
library that [187]is available to his parents and older brothers and
sisters? If the library is to be under the school roof, if dispensary
and relief hospital are to be conducted on the same site as the
school, shall they be known as dispensary, library, relief bureau,
each under separate management, or shall [188]they be known as school
under the management of school principal and superintendent? So
complicated and many-sided is the problem of working together with
one's neighbor for mutual benefit that it is a safe rule for the
schools to adopt: We shall do nothing that is unnecessary or
extravagant. We shall have done our part if we do well what no one
else can do. Whatever any agency can do better than we, we shall leave
to that agency. Work that another agency ought to have done and has
left undone, we shall try to have done by that agency.




IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE MODEL TENEMENTS, BUT UNINFLUENCED
"Getting things done" by the Tenement House Department their special need


I know a hospital where a welfare nurse was recently employed. Within
a few blocks were three different relief agencies and two
visiting-nurse's associations, having among them over one hundred
visitors and nurses going to all sections of Manhattan. This nurse had
the choice of telephoning to one of these agencies and asking it to
call at the needy home of one of her hospital patients, or of going to
the home herself. Had she chosen to use another agency, she could have
been the means of furnishing the kind of help needed in every needy
home discovered in her hospital rounds, but she chose to do the
running about herself and thus of helping ten families where she ought
to have helped five hundred. Much the same condition confronts the
school that tries to do all extra work for its child instead of seeing
that the work is done. Illustration is afforded by the New York
tenement department. Whereas European cities have built a few model
tenements, New York City secured a law declaring that everybody who
built a tenement and everybody who owned a tenement should provide
sanitary surroundings. At the present time a philanthropist, by
spending two million dollars, could give sanitary surroundings to
thirty-five families; by spending each year the interest on one tenth
that sum he could insure the enforcement of the tenement laws
affecting every tenement resident in New York City.

[189]If schools are to perform surgical operations, they are in danger of
being sued for malpractice; discipline will be interfered with.
Finally, let us not forget that we are dealing with buildings,
teachers, and school institutions as they exist. Where education is
made compulsory, the unpleasant and the controversial should be kept
out of school. Because a democratic institution, the American school
should represent at all times a maximum of general agreement.

To take palliative measures to public schools not only leaves
undone remedial work necessary for the health of public school
children but neglects entirely the still large numbers who go to
parochial, private pay, and private free schools; no one has had the
temerity to suggest that the public shall force upon nonpublic schools
a system of free operations, free eyeglasses, free meals.

Civilization has painstakingly developed a large number of agencies
for the education and protection of mankind. Of these agencies the
school is but one. Its first and peculiar function is to teach and to
train. This it can do better than any other agency or combination of
agencies. In attempting to "bring all life under the school roof," we
use but a small part of our resources. Instead of persuading each of
the agencies for the promotion of health to do its part for school
children, we set up the school in competition with them. Thus in
trying to do things for school children we are in danger of
crippling agencies equipped to do things for both school children and
their parents, for babies before they come to school, and for wage
earners after they leave school.

Getting things done will lead schools to study underlying causes;
doing things has heretofore caused schools to confine themselves to
symptoms. Getting things done will leave the school free to
concentrate its attention upon school problems; doing things will
lead it afield into the problem of medicine, surgery, restaurant
keeping, and practical charity.






[190]

CHAPTER XXToC

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FOR WORKING PAPERS


There is no sacred right to work when our work involves injury to
ourselves and to our neighbor. Work at the expense of health is an
unjustifiable tax upon the state. It is the duty of society to protect
itself against such depletion of national efficiency.

Three classes of workmen need special attention: (1) those who are
physically unfit to work; (2) those who are physically unfitted for
the work they are doing; (3) those who are subjected to unhealthful
surroundings while at work. Viewing these three classes from the
standpoint of their neighbors, we have three social rights that should
be enforced by law: (1) the right to freedom from unhealthy work; (2)
the right to work fitted to the body; (3) the right to healthy
surroundings at work.

It is undoubtedly true that just as the sick child may be found at the
head of his class, so unhealthy men and women are often good business
managers, good salesmen, good typewriters, successful capitalists.
They excel, however, not because of their ill health, but in spite of
it, excepting of course those instances where men and women, because
of ill health, have devoted to business an attention that would have
been given to recreation if bad health had not deprived recreation of
its pleasure. As statistics in school have proved that the majority of
mentally superior children are also physically superior, so statistics
will probably prove that the number of the "sick superior" among the
working classes is very small, while the danger of inefficiency that
comes from physical defect is very great.

[191]There is one time in the individual's working life when the state may
properly step in and demand an inventory of physical resources, and
that is when the child asks the state for permission to go to work.
Strategically, this is probably the most important of all contact as
yet provided between society and the future wage earner. Here at the
threshold of his industrial career the boy may be told for what work
he is physically fitted, what physical defects need to be remedied,
what physical precautions he needs to take, in order to do justice to
himself and his opportunity.

Every year from two to three million children leave the public schools
of this country to join the army of workers. The percentage of those
recruits who have physical defects needing attention is undoubtedly
great; how great we shall never know until the benefits of physical
examination are given to all of them. What steps is your state taking
to ascertain the physical fitness of the children who present
themselves each year for working papers? How does it insure itself
against the risk of their defective eyesight, chorea, deafness, or
general debility? Does it inform children of their defects, or tell
them how they may increase their earning power by correcting these
defects? What effort does it make to induce children to avoid
dangerous trades, or trades that are particularly dangerous for their
physiques?

At the close of school last spring I had my secretary look in upon the
New York board of health and see what demands that city makes upon its
boys and girls before allowing them to drive its machinery, to run its
elevators, to match its colors, to sew on its buttons, to set its
type, to carry its checks to the bank. The officer at the door of the
room where the children were being examined, greeted her as follows:
"You must bring your child with you; bring his birth certificate or
swear that he is fourteen years old, and bring a signed statement from
his teacher that he has been in school for one hundred and thirty
consecutive days [192]within twelve months." "Is there no physical
examination or test?" she asked. "No, no," he answered impatiently.
Yet the board of health certifies that "said child has in our opinion
reached the normal development of a child of its age, and is in sound
health and is physically able to perform the work which it intends to
do." In addition the blank calls for place and date of birth, color of
hair and of eyes, height, weight, and facial marks. Volunteer
societies in practically every state in the Union have been working
for years to have it made a criminal offense to employ a child who has
not been in school a minimum of days after a stated age (12, 13, 14,
15). Even in New York, however, the center of this agitation, no
strong demand was made upon the board of health to apply a
physical-fitness test as well as an age test until 1908 when
examination for working papers was added to the programme for child
hygiene. Yet who does not know girls and boys of sixteen less fit for
factory or shop work than other boys and girls of twelve? It is the
fetich of age which has made possible the "democracy" that permits a
child of fourteen to work all day on condition that he go to school at
night!




CHILDREN ENLISTING IN THE INDUSTRIAL ARMY


[193]


 WAITING TO BE EXAMINED FOR WORKING PAPERS
An excellent opportunity for physical-fitness tests


So great is the risk of defective, sickly, or intemperate employees,
that in some trades employers take every precaution to exclude them.
One man with defective eyesight or unsteady nerves may cost a railroad
thousands of dollars. As insurance companies rank trades as first-,
second-, or third-class risks, so many factories, from long
experience, debar men with certain characteristics which have been
found detrimental to business. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company
of New York City examines all applicants for employment, as to age,
weight, height, keenness of vision, hearing, color perception, lungs,
hearts, arteries, alcoholism, and nicotinism. Those who fall below the
standard are rejected, but in each case the physical condition is
explained to the applicant. Where defects are removable or
correctable, the applicant is told what to do and invited to take
another test after treatment. Moreover, accepted employees are
periodically re      xamined. While designed to [194]increase company profits
and to reduce company losses, this examination obviously decreases the
employees' losses also, and increases the certainty of work and
prospect of promotion.

Our states, and many of our industries, still have the attitude of a
certain manufacturer who employs several hundred boys and girls. I
asked him what tests he employed. "I look over a long line of the
applicants and say," pointing his finger, "I want you, and you, and
you; the rest may go." I asked him if he made a point of picking out
those who looked strong. "No. The work is easy, sitting down all day
long and picking over things. I select those whose faces I like. Yes,
there is one question we now ask of all the girls. One day a girl in
the workroom had an epileptic fit and it frightened everybody and
upset the work so that the foreman always asks, 'Do you have fits?
Because if you do, you can't work here.'" He makes no attempt to
determine the physical fitness and endurance of the children employed,
because when the strength of one is spent there is always another to
step into her place.

Because the apprentice's future is of no value to the manufacturer,
the state must restrict the manufacturer's freedom to spend like water
society's capital,       the health of the coming generation. Could there
be a grosser mis-management of society's business than to permit trade
to waste children on whose education society spends so many millions
yearly? The most effective and most timely remedy is physical
examination as a condition of the work certificate. A simple, easily
applied, inexpensive measure that imposes only a legitimate
restriction upon individual freedom, it is absolutely necessary in
order to get to the bottom of the child labor problem. If thoroughly
applied, children of the nation will no longer be exploited by
unscrupulous or indifferent employers, nor will their health be
hazarded by lack of discriminating examination that rejects the
obviously sick and favors the apparently robust. Furthermore,
knowledge [195]that this test will be applied when work certificates are
required, will be an incentive to the school boy and girl to keep
well. Tell a boy that adenoids or weak lungs will keep him from
getting a job, and you will make him a strong advocate of operation
and of fresh air. Show him that his employers will not wish his
services when his week is out if he is physically below par, and he
will gladly submit to a [196]board of health examination and ask to be
told what his defects are and how to correct them.




CHILDREN AT WORK BELOW BOTH AGE LIMIT AND VITALITY LIMIT
National Child Labor Committee


Some there are who will object to this appeal to the child's economic
instinct. This objection does not remove the instinct. The normal
child is greedy for a job. His greed, as well as that of the
manufacturer and parent, is responsible for much of the child labor;
his greed for activity, for association, for money, and so for work. A
little boy came into my office and wanted to hire as an office boy. I
looked at him and said: "My little fellow, you ought to be in school.
What do you want to hire out here for?" He said, "I am tired of
school; nothing doing." He doesn't care about work for its own sake;
he doesn't care about wealth for its own sake; he wants to get into
life; to be where there is "something doing." In this lies one potent
argument for vocational training. To tell a boy of his physical needs
just before he has taken his first business step is to put him
everlastingly in our debt. Then he is responsive, and, fortunately for
the extreme cases, necessarily dependent, for he knows that his
refusal would stand between himself and his ambition.

When boys and girls go for work certificates to Dr. Goler, medical
officer of health at Rochester, he requires not merely evidence of age
and of schooling, but examines their eyes for defective vision and for
disease, their teeth for cavities and unhealthy gums, and their noses
and throats for adenoids and enlarged tonsils. If a boy has sixteen
decayed teeth, Dr. Goler explains to him that teeth are meant to be
not only ornaments and conveniences, but money getters as well. The
boy learns that decayed teeth breed disease, contaminate food,
interfere with digestion, make him a disagreeable companion and a less
efficient worker. If he will go and have them put into proper
condition he will enjoy life better and earn good wages sooner. After
the teeth are attended to the boy secures his work [197]certificate. If
the boy's mother protests in tears or in anger that her boy does not
work with his teeth, she learns what she never learned at school, that
sound teeth help pay the rent. If a girl applicant for working papers
has adenoids, she is asked to look in the mirror and to notice how her
lips fail to meet, how the lower jaw drops, how much better she looks
with her jaws and lips together. She is told that other people breathe
through the nose, and that perhaps the reason she dislikes school and
does not feel as she used to about play is that she cannot breathe
through her nose as she used to. She is shown that her nose is stopped
up by a spongy substance, as big as the end of her little finger,
which obstruction can be easily removed. She is shown adenoids and
enlarged tonsils that have been removed from some other girl, and is
so impressed with the before-operation and after-operation contrast
and by the story of the other girl's rapid increase in wages, that she
and her mother both decide not to wait for the adenoids to disappear
by absorption. After the operation they come back with proof that the
trouble is gone, and get the "papers." Similar instruction is given
when defects of vision seriously interfere with a child's prospects of
getting ahead in his work, or when evidence of incipient tuberculosis
makes it criminal to put a child in a store or factory.




THE GRENFELL ASSOCIATION FINDS MOUTH BREATHERS AT WORK IN LABRADOR


No law as yet authorizes the health officer of Rochester to refuse
work certificates to children physically unfit to become wage earners.
A higher law than that which any legislature can pass or revoke, has
given Dr. Goler power [198]over children and parents, namely, interest in
children and knowledge of the industrial handicap that results from
physical defects. This higher law authorizes every health officer in
the United States to examine the school child before issuing a work
certificate, to tell the child and his parents what defects need to be
removed, for what trades he is physically unfitted, what trades will
not increase his physical weakness, and to what trade he is physically
adapted.

We should not forget that a large proportion of our children never
apply for work certificates; some because they never intend to work;
some because they expect to remain in school until sixteen or later;
some because they live on farms, in small towns, or in cities and
states where prohibition of child labor is not enforced. Because there
is no reason for this large proportion of children to visit a board of
health, some substitute must be found. This substitute has been
already suggested by principals and district superintendents in New
York City, who claim that the natural place for the examination of
children is the school and not health headquarters. Developing the
idea that the school should pronounce the child's fitness to leave
school and to engage in work, we are led to the suggestion that the
state, which compels evidence that every child, rich or poor, is being
taught during the compulsory school age, shall also at the age of
fourteen or sixteen require evidence that the child is physically fit
to use his education, and that it shall not, because of preventable
ill health, prove a losing investment.

Parochial and private schools, the ultra-religious and ultra-rich, may
resent for a time public supervision of the physical condition of
children who do not ask for work certificates. This position will be
short-lived, because however much we may disagree about society's
right to control a child's act after his physical defects are
discovered, few of us will question the state's duty to tell that
child and his [199]parents the truth about his physical needs before it
accepts his labor or permits him to go to college, to "come out," to
"enter society," or to live on an income provided by others. Thus an
invaluable commencement present can be given by the state to children
in country schools and to those compelled to drop out of fourth or
fifth grades of city schools.




THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S CLINICAL CARE AND HOME INSTRUCTION COME AFTER WAGE LOSSES,
WHILE WORK CERTIFICATES PRECEDE BREAKDOWNS FROM TUBERCULOSIS


A brief test of this method of helping children, such as is now being
made by several boards of health at the instance of the National
Bureau of Labor, will prove conclusively that parents are grateful for
the timely discovery of these defects which handicap because of their
existence, not because of their discovery. Of the cadets preparing for
war at West Point, it has recently been decided that those "who in the
physical examinations are found to have deteriorated below the
prescribed physical standard will be dropped from the rolls of the
academy." Shall not cadets preparing [200]for an industrial life and
citizenship be given at least a knowledge of an adequate physical
standard? To allow the school child to deteriorate whether before or
after going to work is only to waste potential citizenship. Citizens
who use themselves up in the mere getting of a living have no surplus
strength or interest for overcoming incompetence in civic business, or
for achieving the highest aim of citizenship,       the art of
self-government for the benefit of all the governed.






[201]

CHAPTER XXIToC

PERIODICAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AFTER SCHOOL AGE


Governor Hughes, in his address to the students in Gettysburg College,
pleaded for such lives that strength would be left for the years of
achievement. How many men and women can you count who are squandering
their health bank account? How many do you know who are now physically
bankrupt? The man who is prodigal of his health may work along all
right for years, never realizing until the test comes that he is
running behind in his vitality. The test may be hard times, promotion,
exposure to cold, heat, fever, or a sudden call for all his control in
avoiding accident. If his vitality fails to stand the test, his career
may be ruined, "all for the want of a horseshoe nail": because of no
health bank account to draw upon in time of need,       failure; because of
vitality depleted by alcohol, tobacco, overeating, underexercise, or
too little sleep,       no power to resist contagious diseases; because of
ignorance of existing lung trouble,       a year or more of idleness,
perhaps poverty for his family; or there is neglected ear or eye
trouble,       and thousands of lives may be lost because the engineer
failed to read the signals.

Adults are now examined when applying for insurance or accident
policies, for work on railroads, for service in the army and on the
police and fire forces of cities that provide pensions. It is somewhat
surprising that the hundreds of thousands who carry life insurance
policies have not realized that a test which is rigorously imposed for
business reasons by insurance companies can be applied by individuals
for [202]business reasons. Generations hence the state will probably
require of every person periodic physical examination after school
age. Decades hence business enterprises will undoubtedly require
evidence of health and vitality from employees before and during
employment, just as schools will require such evidence from teachers.
It is, after all, but a step from the police passport to the health
passport. Why should we not protect ourselves against enemies to
health and efficiency as well as against enemies to order? But for the
present we must rely upon the intelligence of individuals to recognize
the advantage to themselves, their families, and their employers, of
knowing that their bodies do not harbor hidden enemies of vitality and
efficiency. From a semi-annual examination of teeth to a semi-annual
physical examination is but a short step when once its effectiveness
is seen by a few in each community.




THE OLD SOUTHFIELD, NOW ANCHORED AT BELLEVUE HOSPITAL'S DOCK, NEW YORK CITY,
GIVES DAILY LESSONS IN THE PREVENTABLE TAX LEVIED BY TUBERCULOSIS


[203]Ignorance of one's physical condition is a luxury no one can afford.
No society is rich enough to afford members ignorant of physical
weaknesses prejudicial to others' health and efficiency. Every one of
us, even though to all appearances physically normal, needs the
biological engineer. New conditions come upon us with terrific
rapidity. The rush of work, noise, dust, heat, and overcrowding of
modern industry make it important to have positive evidence that we
have successfully adapted ourselves to these new conditions. Only by
measuring the effects of these environmental forces upon our bodies
can we prevent some trifling physical flaw from developing into a
chronic or acute condition. As labor becomes more and more highly
specialized, the body of the laborer is forced to readapt itself. The
kind of work a man does determines which organs shall claim more than
their share of blood and energy. The man who sets type develops
keenness of vision and manual dexterity. The stoker develops the
muscles of his arms and back, the engineer alertness of eye and ear.
All sorts of devices have been invented to aid this specialization of
particular organs, as well as to correct their imperfections: the
magnifying glass, the telescope, the microscope, extend the powers of
the eye; the spectacle or an operation on the eye muscles enables the
defective eye to do normal work. A man with astigmatism might be a
policeman all his life, win promotion, and die ignorant of his defect;
whereas if the same man had become a chauffeur, he might have killed
himself and his employer the first year, or, if an accountant, he
might have been a chronic dyspeptic from long-continued eye strain. It
is a soul tragedy for a man to attempt a career for which he is
physically unadapted.[11] It is a social tragedy when men and women
squander their health. A great deal of the success attributed to luck
and opportunity, or unusual [204]mental endowment, is in reality due to a
chance compatibility of work with physique. To secure such
compatibility is the purpose of physical examination after school age.

If the periodic visit to the doctor is the first law of adult health,
still more imperative is the law that competent physicians should be
seen at the first indication of ill health. Even when competent
physicians are at hand, parents and teachers should be taught what
warning signs may mean and what steps should be taken. In Germany
insurance companies find that it saves money to provide free medical
and dental care for the insured. Department stores, many factories and
railroads, have learned from experience that they save money by
inducing their employees to consult skilled physicians at the first
sign of physical disorder. Many colleges, schools, and "homes" have a
resident physician. Wherever any large number of people are assembled
together,       in a hotel, factory, store, ship, college, or
school,       there should be an efficient consulting physician at hand. If
people are needlessly alarmed, it is of the utmost importance to show
them that there is nothing seriously wrong. Therefore visits to the
consulting physician should be encouraged.

The reader's observation will suggest numerous illustrations of pain,
prolonged sickness, loss of life, that could have been prevented had
the physician been semi-annually visited. A strong man, well educated,
with large income, personally acquainted with several of the foremost
physicians of New York City, after suffering two weeks from pains
"that would pass away," was hurriedly taken to a hospital at three
o'clock in the morning, operated upon immediately, and died at nine. A
business man of means put off going to a physician for fifteen years,
for fear he would be told that his throat trouble was tobacco cancer,
or incipient tuberculosis, or asthma; a physical examination showed
that a difficulty of breathing and chronic throat [205]trouble were due to
a growth in the nose, corrected in a few minutes by operation.

A celebrated economist was forced to give up academic work, and
consecrated his life to painful and chronic dyspepsia because of eye
trouble detected upon the first physical examination. A woman
secretary suffered from alleged heart trouble; paralysis threatened,
continuous headache and blurred vision forced her to give up work and
income; a physical examination found the cause in nasal growths, whose
removal restored normal conditions. A woman lecturer on children's
health heard described last summer a friend's experience with receding
gums: "'Why, I never heard of that disease.' she said. 'Don't you know
you have it yourself'? I asked. She had never noticed that her gums
were growing away in little points on her front teeth. I touched the
uncovered portion and she winced. That ignorance has meant intense
pain and ugly fillings. If it had gone longer, it might have meant the
loss of her front teeth." A teacher lost a month from nervous
prostration; physical examination would have discovered the eye
trouble that deranged the stomach and produced the nerve-racking
shingles which forced him to take a month's vacation. A journalist
lost weeks each year because of strained ankles; since being told that
he had flat foot, and that the arch of his foot could be strengthened
by braces and specially made shoes, he has not lost a minute. A relief
visitor, ardent advocate of the fresh-air, pure-milk treatment for
tuberculosis, had a "little cough" and an occasional "cold sweat";
medical friends knew this, but humored her aversion to examination;
when too late, she submitted to an examination and to the treatment
which, if taken earlier, would most certainly have cured her. A
mother's sickness cost a wage-earning daughter nearly $3000; softening
of the brain was feared; after six years of suffering and unnecessary
expense, physical examination disclosed an easily removable cause,
[206]and for two years she has contributed to the family income instead of
exhausting it. Untold suffering is saved many a mother by knowledge of
her special physical need in advance [207]of her baby's birth. Untold
suffering might be saved many a woman in business if she could be told
in what respects she was transgressing Nature's law.




NEW YORK CITY'S TUBERCULOSIS SANATORIUM AT OTISVILLE IS
SENDING HOME APOSTLES OF SEMI-ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS





BOSTON'S PICTURESQUE DAY CAMP FOR TUBERCULOSIS PATIENTS
IS TEACHING THE NEED FOR A PERIODIC INVENTORY OF PHYSICAL RESOURCES


To encourage periodic physical examination is not to encourage morbid
thinking of disease. One reason for our tardiness in recognizing the
need for thorough physical examination is the doctor's tradition of
treating symptoms. After men and women are intelligent enough to
demand an inventory of their physical resources,       a balance sheet of
their physical assets and liabilities,       physicians will study the
whole man and not the fraction of a man in which they happen to be
specializing or about which the patient worries. By removing the
mystery of bodily ailments and by familiarizing ourselves with the
essentials to healthy living, we find protection against charlatans,
quacks, faddists, and experimenters. By taking a periodic inventory of
our physical resources we discharge a sacred obligation of
citizenship.

CHAPTER XXIIToC

HABITS OF HEALTH PROMOTE INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY


Education's highest aim is to train us to do the right thing at the
right moment without having to think. The technic of musician,
stenographer, artist, electrician, surgeon, orator, is gained only
from patient training of the body's reflex muscles to do brain
work.[12] The lower nerve centers are storehouses for the brain
energy, just as central power houses are used for storing electric
energy to be spent upon demand. From habit, not from mental effort, we
turn to the right, say "I beg pardon" when we step on another's foot,
give our seats to ladies or to elderly persons, use acceptable table
manners. No person seems "to the manner born" who has to think out
each act necessary to "company manners." How numerous are the mental
and physical processes essential to good manners no one ever
recognizes but the very bashful or the uncouth person trying to
cultivate habits of unconsciousness in polite society. The habit of
living ethically enables us to go through life without being tempted
to steal or lie or do physical violence. No person's morals can be
relied upon who is tempted constantly to do immoral acts; ethical
training seeks to incapacitate us for committing unethical deeds and
to habituate us to ethical acts alone.

Eight different elements of industrial efficiency are concerned with
the individual's health habits,       the industrial worker, his industrial
product, his employer, his employer's [209]profit, his trade or
profession, its product, his nation, national product. Obviously few
men have so little to do that they have time to think out in detail
how this act or that indulgence will affect each of these eight
factors of industrial efficiency. Once convinced, however, that all of
these elements are either helped or injured by the individual's method
of living, each one of us has a strong reason for imposing habits of
health upon all industries, upon employees and operatives, upon all
who are a part of industrial efficiency. When these eight relations
are seen, parents and teachers have particularly strong reasons for
inculcating habits of health in their children.

That industrial inefficiency results from chronic habits of unhealthy
living is generally recognized. The alcoholic furnishes the most vivid
illustration. The penalties suffered by him and his family are grave
enough, but because he has not full possession of his faculties he is
unpunctual, wastes material, disobeys instructions, endangers others'
lives, decreases the product of his trade and of his employer, lessens
the profits of both, depresses wages, increases insurance and business
risks. Because no one can foresee when the "drop too much" will be
taken, industry finds it important to know that the habit of drinking
alcoholics moderately has not been acquired by train dispatcher,
engineer, switchman, chauffeur. Because the habit of drinking
moderately is apt, among lower incomes, to go hand in hand with other
habits injurious to business and fatal to integrity, positions of
trust in industry seek men and women who have the habit of declining
drink.

In the aggregate, milder forms of unhealthy living interfere with
industrial efficiency even more than alcoholism. Many capable men and
women, even those who have had thorough technical training, fail to
win promotion because their persons are not clean, their breath
offensive, their clothes suggestive of disorderly, uncleanly habits.
Persons [210]of extraordinary capacity not infrequently achieve only
mediocre results because they fail to cultivate habits of cleanliness
and health. An employer can easily protect his business from loss due
to alcoholism among his own employees; but loss through employees'
constipation, headache, bad ventilation at home, irregular meals,
improper diet, too many night parties, nicotinism, personal
uncleanliness, is loss much harder to anticipate and avoid. Because
evil results are less vivid, it is also hard to convince a clerk that
intemperance in eating, sleeping, and playing will interfere with his
earning capacity and his enjoyment capacity quite as surely as
intemperance in the use of alcohol and nicotine. Where employees are
paid by the piece, instead of by the hour, day, or week, the employer
partially protects himself against uneven, sluggish, slipshod workmen;
but, other things being equal, he awards promotion to those who are
[211]most regular and who are most often at their best, for he finds that
the man who does not "slump" earns best profits and deserves highest
pay.




THESE PATIENTS ON THE OLD SOUTHFIELD ARE TAXING THEIR
UNIONS AND THEIR TRADES AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILIES AND THE TUBERCULOSIS COMMITTEE


There are exceptions, it is true, where both industrial promotion and
industrial efficiency are won by people who violate laws of
health,       but at what cost to their efficiency? Your efficiency should
be measured not by some other person's advancement, but by what you
yourself ought to accomplish; while the effect of abusing your
physical strength is shown not only in the shortening of your
industrial life and in the diminishing returns from your labor, but by
the decrease of national and trade efficiency. "Sweating" injures
those who buy and those in the same trade who are not "sweated" just
as truly as it injures the "sweated."




HABITS OF HEALTH AMONG DAIRYMEN MEAN SAFE MILK FOR BABIES


[212]What are the health habits that should become instinctive and
effortless for every worker? What acts can we make our lower nerve
centers       our subconscious selves       do for us or remind us to do? The
following constitutes a daily routine that should be as involuntary as
the process of digestion:

1. Throw the bedding over the foot of the bed.

2. Close the window that has been open during the night.

3. Drink a glass of water.

4. Bathe the face, neck, crotch, chest, armpits (finishing if not
beginning with cold water), and particularly the eyes, ears, and
nose. If time and conveniences permit, bathe all over.

5. Cleanse the finger nails.

6. Cleanse the teeth, especially the places that are out of sight
and hard to reach.

7. Breakfast punctually at a regular hour. Eat lightly and only
what agrees with you. If you read a morning paper, be interested
in news items that have to do with personal and community
vitality.

8. Visit the toilet; if impracticable at home, have a regular time
at business.

9. Have several minutes in the open air, preferably walking.

10. Be punctual at work.

11. As your right by contract, insist upon a supply of fresh air
for your workroom with the same emphasis you use in demanding
sufficient heat in zero weather.

12. Eat punctually at noon intermission; enjoy your meal and its
after effects.

13. Breathe air out of doors a few minutes, preferably walking.

14. Resume business punctually.

15. Stop work regularly.

16. Take out-of-door exercise       indoor only when fresh air is
possible       that you enjoy and that agrees with you.

17. Be regular, temperate, and leisurely in eating the evening
meal; eat nothing that disagrees with you.

18. Spend the evening profitably and pleasantly and in ways
compatible with the foregoing habits.

[213]19. Retire regularly at a fixed hour, making up for irregularity
by an earlier hour next night.

20, 21, 22. Repeat 4, 6, 8.

23. Turn underclothes wrong side out for ventilation.

24. Open windows.

25. Relax mind and body and go to sleep.

No man chronically neglects any one of the above rules without
reducing his industrial efficiency. No man chronically neglects all of
them without becoming, sooner or later, a health bankrupt.

In addition to this daily routine, there are certain other acts that
should become habitual:

1. Bathing less frequently than once a week is almost as dangerous
to health as it is to attractiveness.

2. Distaste for unclean linen or undergarments and for acts or
foods that interfere with vitality should become instinctive.

3. Excesses in eating or playing should be automatically corrected
the next day and the next. Parties we shall continue to have. It
will be some time before reasonable hours and reasonable
refreshments will prevail. Meanwhile it is probably better for an
individual to sacrifice somewhat his own vitality for the sake of
the union, the class, or the church. While trying to improve group
habits, one can acquire the habit of not eating three meals in
one, of eating less next day, of sleeping longer next night, of
being particularly careful to have plenty of outdoor air.

4. Visits to the dentist twice a year at least, and whenever a
cavity appears, even if only a week after the dentist has failed
to find one; whenever the gums begin to recede; and whenever
anything seems to be wrong with the teeth.

5. Periodic physical examination by a physician.

6. Examination by a competent physician whenever any disorder
cannot be satisfactorily explained by violation of the daily
routine or by interruption of business or domestic routine.

Health habits do not become instinctive until a continued, conscious
effort is made to accustom the body to them. When this is once done,
however, the body not only [214]attends to its primary health needs
automatically, but it rebels at their omission, as surely as does the
stomach at the omission of dinner. Witness the discomfort of the
consumptive, trained to fresh air at a sanatorium, when he returns to
his overheated and underventilated home, or the actual pain
experienced in readjusting our own healthy bodies to the stuffy
workroom or schoolroom after a summer vacation out of doors. I heard a
consumptive say that he left a sanatorium for a day class after trying
for three nights to sleep in an unventilated ward. For many people the
regular morning bath is at first a trial, then a pleasure, and finally
a need; if omitted, the body feels thirsty and dissatisfied, the eyes
sleepy, and the spirit flags early in the day.




IMPROVISED SEASIDE HOSPITAL FOR NONPULMONARY
TUBERCULOSIS AT SEA BREEZE TEACHES PASSERS-BY THE FRESH-AIR GOSPEL


Cold baths are not essential or even good for everybody. The same diet
or the same amount of food or time for eating is not of equal value
for all. The temperature of bath [215]water, the kind and quality of food,
are influenced by one's work and one's cook. Set rules about these
things do more harm than good. Such questions must be decided for each
individual,       by his experience or by the advice of a physician,       but
they must be decided and the decisions converted into health habits if
he would attain the highest efficiency of which he is capable. Here
again our old contrast between "doing things" and "getting things
done" applies. Get your body to attend to the essential needs for you,
and get it to remind you when you let the exigencies of life
interfere. Don't burden your mind every day with work that your body
will do for you if properly trained.




CRIPPLED CHILDREN LEAVING SEA BREEZE HOSPITAL FOR BONE
TUBERCULOSIS FIND STALE AIR OFFENSIVE BY NIGHT OR BY DAY


Obstacles to habits of health are numerous; therefore the importance
of correcting those habits of factory, family, trade, city, or nation
that make health habits impracticable. [216]We must change others'
prejudices before we can breathe clean air on street cars without
riding outside. When one's co-workers are afraid of fresh air,
ventilation of shop, store, and office is impossible. So long as
parents fear night air, children cannot follow advice to sleep with
windows open. Unless the family co      perates in making definite plans
for the use of toilet and bath for each member, constipation and bad
circulation are sure to result. Indigestion is inevitable if employees
are not given lunch periods and closing hours that permit of regular,
unhurried meals. Cleanliness of person costs more than it seems to be
worth where cities fail either to compel bath tubs in rented
apartments or to erect public baths. A temperate subsistence on
adulterated, poisonous, or drugged foods might be better for one's
health than gormandizing on pure foods. No recipe has ever been found
for bringing up a healthy baby on unclean, infected milk; for avoiding
tuberculosis among people who are [217]compelled to work with careless
consumptives in unclean air; or for making a five-story leap as safe
as a fire escape. Perfect habits of health on the part of an
individual will not protect him against enervation or infection
resulting from inefficient enforcement of sanitary codes by city,
county, state, and national authorities.




AT JUNIOR SEA BREEZE, TEACHING MOTHERS THE HEALTH ROUTINE FOR BABIES


The "municipalization" or "public subsidy" of health habits is
indispensable to protecting industrial efficiency. Public lavatories,
above or below ground, have done much to reduce inefficiency due to
alcoholism, constipation of the bowels, and congestion of the kidneys.
Theaters, churches, and assembly rooms could be built so as to drill
audiences in habits of health instead of fixing habits of uncleanly
breathing. Street flushing, drinking fountains, parks and breathing
spaces, playgrounds and outdoor gymnasiums, milk, food, and drug
inspection, tenement, factory, and shop supervision, enforcement of
anti-spitting penalties, restriction of hours of labor, prohibition of
child labor,       these inculcate community habits of health that promote
community efficiency. It is the duty of health boards to compel all
citizens under their jurisdiction to cultivate habits of health and to
punish all who persistently refuse to acquire these habits, so far as
the evils of neglect become apparent to health authorities. The
unlimited educational opportunity of health boards consists in their
privilege to point out repeatedly and cumulatively the industrial and
community benefits that result from habits of health, and the
industrial and community losses that result from habits of unhealthy
living.

CHAPTER XXIIIToC

INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE


To call the movement for better factory conditions the "humanizing of
industry" implies that modern industry not influenced by that movement
is brutalized. The brutalizing of industry was due chiefly to a
general ignorance of health laws,       an ignorance that registers itself
clearly and promptly in factory and mine. It is not that a man is
expected to do too much, but that too little is expected of the human
body. The present recognition of the body's right to vitality is not
because the employer's heart is growing warmer, or because competition
is less vicious, but because the precepts of hygiene are found to be
practical. Where better ventilation used to mean more windows and
repair bills, it now means greater output. Where formerly a
comfortable place in which to eat lunch meant giving up a workroom and
its profits, it now means 25 per cent more work done in all workrooms
during the afternoon. The general enlightenment as to industrial
hygiene has been accelerated by the awakening that always follows
industrial catastrophes, by the splendid crusade against tuberculosis,
and by compulsory notification and treatment of communicable diseases.

Catastrophes, however, have dominated the vocabulary that describes
factory "welfare work." Because accidents such as gas in mines, fire
in factories, fever in towns, and epidemics of diseases incident to
certain trades were beyond the power of the workers themselves to
control or prevent, wage earners have come to be looked upon as
helpless victims of the cupidity and inhumanity of their employers.
[219]This attitude has weakened the usefulness of many bodies organized to
promote industrial hygiene. Although the term "industrial hygiene" is
broad enough to include all sanitary and hygienic conditions that
surround the worker while at work, it is restricted by some to the
efforts made by altruistic or farsighted employers in the interest of
employees; others think of prohibitions and mandates, in the name of
the state, that either prevent certain evils or compel certain
benefits; for too few it refers to what the wage earner does for
himself.

Pity for the employee has caused the motive power of the employee to
be wastefully allowed to atrophy. Yet when a man becomes an employee,
he does not forfeit any right of citizenship, nor does being an
employee relieve him from the duties of citizenship. In too many cases
it has been overlooked that a worker's carelessness about habits of
health, as well as about his machinery, causes accidents and increases
industrial diseases. Too often the worker himself is responsible for
uncleanliness and lack of ventilation and his own consequent lack of
vitality. A study into the conditions of ventilation and cleanliness
of workers' homes will prove this.

Knowing that a light, well-aired, clean, safe factory would not of
itself insure healthy men, many employers have built and supplied
houses for their workmen at low rents. Just as these employers failed
to see that they could reach more people and secure more permanent
results if they demanded that tenement laws and the sanitary code be
enforced as well as the laws for the instruction of children in
hygiene, so the employee has failed to see that he is a part of the
public that passes laws and determines the efficiency of factory
inspection. The enforcement of state legislation for working hours,
proper water and milk supply, proper teaching of children, proper
tenement conditions, efficient health administration, is dependent
upon the interest and [220]activity of the public, of which the working
class is no small or uninfluential part.




COUNTRY CLUB HOUSE FOR NEW YORK SOCIAL WORKERS
Given by the founder of Caroline Rest Educational Fund


The first and most important step in securing hygienic rights for
workingmen is to make sure that they know the rights that the law
already gives them. Men still throw out their chests when talking of
their rights. The posting of the game laws in a club last summer, and
the instruction of all the natives of the countryside in regard to
their rights as against those of outsiders, meant that for the first
time in their history the game laws were enforced. All the natives,
instead of poaching as has been their wont, joined together in
protecting club property from intruding outside sportsmen. Poachers
were caught and served with the full penalties of the law. Over winter
fires these people's heroism will grow, but their respect for law will
grow also, and it is doubtful if the game laws can be violated in that
section so long as the tradition of this summer's work [221]lives. And so
it would be in a factory, if employees once realized that by uniting
they could, as citizens, enforce health rights in the factory.

The hygiene of the workshop is not the same problem as the hygiene of
the home and schoolhouse, because there are by-products of factory work
that contaminate the air, overheat the room, and complicate the
ordinary problems of ventilation. Certain trades are recognized as
"dangerous trades." The problem of adequate government control of
factories is one for a sanitary engineer. It has to do with
disease-bearing raw material that comes to a factory, disease-producing
processes of manufacture. There is need for revision of the
dangerous-trade list. Many of the industries not so classed should be;
many of the so-called dangerous trades can be made comparatively
harmless by devices for exhausting harmful by-products. Industrial
diseases should be made "notifiable," so that they can be controlled by
the factory or health department. It is those trades that are dangerous
because of remediable unsanitary and unhygienic conditions which demand
the employer's attention. Complaints should be made by individuals when
carelessness or danger becomes commonplace.

The manner in which many organizations have tried to better working
conditions is similar to the manner in which Europeans are trying to
help defective school children. Here, as there, is the difference
between doing things and getting things done. Here more than there
is the tendency to exaggerate legislation and to neglect enforcement
of law. Instead of harnessing the whole army of workingmen to the
crusade and strengthening civic agencies such as factory, health, and
tenement departments, houses are built and given to men, clubs are
formed to amuse factory girls, amateur theatricals are organized. All
this is called "welfare work." "What is welfare work?" reads the
pamphlet of a large national association. "It is especial
consideration [222]on the part of the employer for the welfare of his
employees." In the words of this pamphlet, the aim of this association
"is to organize the best brains of the nation in an educational
movement toward the solution of some of the great problems related to
social and industrial progress." The membership is drawn from
"practical men of affairs, whose acknowledged leadership in thought
and business makes them typical representatives of business elements
that voluntarily work together for the general good." As defined by
this organization, welfare work is something given to the employee by
the employer for the welfare of both. It is not something the employee
himself does to improve his own working conditions.

We are told that employees should assume the management of welfare
work.

Should they install sanitary conveniences? Of course not.

Would they know the need of a wash room in a factory if they never
had had one? No.

Should they manage lunch rooms? A few employers have attempted
unsuccessfully to turn over the management of the lunch rooms to
the employees, the result being that one self-sacrificing
subofficial in each concern would find the burden entirely on his
shoulders before working hours, during working hours, and after
working hours. Employees cannot attend committee meetings during
working hours, and they are unwilling to do so afterwards, for
they generally have outside engagements. Furthermore, the
employees know nothing about the restaurant business. If they did,
they would probably be engaged in it instead of in their different
trades. All experiments along this line of which we have heard
have failed. The so-called "democratic idea," purely a fad, never
has been successfully operated.

Many employers would introduce welfare work into their
establishments were it not for the time and trouble needed for its
organization. The employment of a welfare director removes this
obstacle. Successful prosecution of welfare work requires
concentration of responsibility. All of its branches must be under
the supervision of one person, or efforts in different directions
may conflict, or special and perhaps pressing needs may escape
attention. Pressure of daily business routine usually relegates
welfare work to the last consideration, but the average employer
is interested in his men and is willing to improve their condition
if only their needs are brought to his attention.

[223]


FIRST LESSONS IN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE


[224]


WELFARE WORK THAT COUNTS


[225]This method of promoting the welfare of the worker may have been a
necessary step in the development of industrial hygiene. Undoubtedly
it has succeeded, in many cases, in bringing to an employer's
consciousness the needs of his workmen, in accustoming employees to
higher sanitary standards, and in teaching them to demand health
rights from their employers. In many cases, however, "welfare work"
has miseducated both employer and employee. The fact that "the
so-called democratic idea, purely a fad, has never been successfully
operated," is due to the interpretation given to "democratic idea."
The two alternatives in the paragraph above quoted are lunch rooms,
wash rooms, as gifts from employers to employees, or lunch rooms and
wash rooms to be furnished by employees at their own expense. The true
democratic idea, however, is that factory conditions detrimental to
health shall be prohibited by factory legislation, and this
legislation enforced by efficient factory inspectors, regardless of
what may be given to employees above the requirement of hygiene.

Until employees are more active as citizens and more sensitive to
hygienic rights, it is desirable that welfare directors be employed in
factories to arbitrate between employer and employee, to raise the
moral standard of a factory settlement, to organize amusements.

Welfare work at its best is a method of dividing business profits
among all who participate in making these profits. Too often welfare
secretaries teach employees how to be happy in the director's way,
rather than in their own way. This adventitious position increases
suspicion on both sides, [226]disturbs the discipline of the foreman,
weakens rather than strengthens the worker's efficiency, because it
depends upon other things than work well done and the relation of
health to efficiency. In a small factory town the owner of a large
cotton mill has recognized the financial benefit of physically strong
workers, and is trying the experiment of a welfare director. The man
himself works "with his sleeves up." The social worker has an office
in the factory. A clubhouse is fitted up for the mill hands to make
merry in. A room in the factory is reserved for a lunch room, with
plants, tables, and chairs for the comfort of the women. Parties are
given by the employer to the employees, which he himself attends. He
has thrown himself into whatever schemes his director has suggested.
The director complained that the reason the new lunch room was not
more popular was because a piano was needed. A second-hand one would
not do, for that would cultivate bad taste in music. This showed the
employer that soon everything would be expected from the "big house on
the hill." An event which happened at the time when the pressure was
greatest on him for the piano, convinced him that his employees could
supply their real needs without any trouble or delay. The assistant
manager was about to leave, and in less than a week five hundred
dollars was raised among the workers for his farewell gift. Walking
home that night late from his office the owner was attracted by the
sound of jollity, and saw a little room jammed full of mill people
enjoying the improvised music of a mouth organ played to the
accompaniment of heels. He resolved henceforth to train his employees
to do his work well and to earn more pay,       and to let them amuse
themselves. From that time on he refused to be looked upon as the
deus ex machina of the town. He decided that the best way to give
English lessons to foreigners was to improve the school. His
beneficence in supplying them with pure water at the mill did [227]not
prevent a ravaging typhoid epidemic because the town water was not
watched. He saw that the best way to improve health was to strengthen
the health board and to make his co-workers realize that they were
citizens responsible for their own privileges and rights.

Emergency hospitals and Y.M.C.A. buildings are sad substitutes for
safety devices and automatic couplers. Christmas shopping in November
is less kind than prevention of overwork in December. Night school and
gymnastic classes are a poor penance for child labor and for work
unsuited to the body. The left hand cannot dole favors enough to
offset the evils of underpay, of unsanitary conditions, of inefficient
enforcement of health laws tolerated by the right hand.

Just because a man is taking wages for work done, is no reason why he
should forfeit his rights as a citizen, or allow his children,
sisters, neighbors, to work in conditions which decrease their
efficiency and earning power. What the employee can do for himself as
a citizen, having equal health rights with employers, he has never
been taught to see. Factory legislation is state direction of
industries so far as relates to the safety, health, and moral
condition of the people,       and which embraces to-day, more than in any
other epoch, the opinion of the workers themselves. No government,
however strong, can hope successfully to introduce social legislation
largely affecting personal interests until public opinion has been
educated to the belief that the remedies proposed are really
necessary. Until schools insist upon a better ventilation than the
worst factories, how can we expect to find children of working age
sensitive to impure air? Where work benches are more comfortable than
school desks, where drinking water is cleaner and towels more
sanitary, however unsanitary they may be, than those found in the
schoolhouse, the worker does not realize that they menace his right to
earn a living wage as much as does a temporary shut-down.

[228]Employers are by no means solely to blame for unhealthy working
conditions. A shortsighted employee is as anxious to work overtime for
double pay as a shortsighted employer is to have him. Among those who
are agitating for an eight-hour day are many who, from self-interest
or interest in the cause, work regularly from ten to sixteen hours.

Would it help to punish employees for working in unhealthy places? The
highest service that can be rendered industrial hygiene is to educate
the industrial classes to recognize hygienic evils and to co      perate
with other citizens in securing the enforcement of health rights.

CHAPTER XXIVToC

THE LAST DAYS OF TUBERCULOSIS


If the historian Lecky was right in saying that the greatest triumphs of
the nineteenth century were its sanitary achievements, the Lecky of the
twenty-first century will probably honor our generation not for its
electricity, its trusts, and its scientific research, but for its
crusade against the white plague and for its recognition of health
rights. Thanks to committees for the prevention of tuberculosis,       local,
state, national, international,       we are fast approaching the time when
every parent, teacher, employer, landlord, worker, will see in
tuberculosis a personal enemy,       a menace to his fireside, his income,
and his freedom. Just as this nation could not exist half slave, half
free, we of one mind now affirm that equal opportunity cannot exist
where one death in ten is from a single preventable disease.[13]




DR. TRUDEAU'S "LITTLE RED COTTAGE" AT SARANAC       BIRTHPLACE OF OUT-OF-DOOR TREATMENT IN AMERICA


Of no obstacle to efficient living is it more true than of
tuberculosis, that the remedy depends upon enforcing rather than upon
making law, upon practice rather than upon precept, upon health habits
rather than upon medical remedies, upon co      peration of lay citizens
rather than upon medical science or isolated individual effort.
Without learning another fact about tuberculosis, we can stamp it out
if we will but apply, and see that officers of health apply, lessons
of cleanliness and natural living already known to us.

[230]Perhaps the most striking results yet obtained in combating
tuberculosis are those of the Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston. To visit its tuberculosis classes reminds one more of the
sociable than the clinic. In fact, one wonders whether the milk diet
and the rest cure or the effervescing optimism and good cheer of the
physicians and nurses should be credited with the marvelous cures. The
first part of the hour is given to writing on the blackboard the
number of hours that the class members spent out of doors the
preceding week. So great was the rivalry for first place that the
nurse protested that a certain boy in the front row gave himself
indigestion by trying to eat his meals in ten or fifteen minutes. It
was then suggested that twenty hours a day would be enough for any one
to stay out of doors, and that plenty of time should be taken for
meals with the family and for cold baths, keeping clean, etc.
Interesting facts gathered by personal interviews of two physicians
with individual patients are explained to the whole class. Next to the
number of hours out of doors, the most interesting fact is the number
of hours of exercise permitted. A man of forty, the head of a family,
beamed like a school child when told that, after nearly a year of
absolute rest, he might during the next week exercise ten minutes a
day. A graduate drops in, the very picture of health, weighing two
hundred pounds. An apparently hopeless case would brighten up and have
confidence when told that this strong, handsome man has gained fifty
pounds by rest, good cheer, fresh air, all on his own porch. One young
man, just back from a California sanatorium where he progressively
lost strength in spite of change of climate, is now returning to work
and is back at normal weight.

[231]


OUTDOOR LIFE CHART.


[232]


FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS IN THE MOUNTAINS       SARANAC


Every patient keeps a daily record, called for by the following
instructions:

Make notes of temperature and pulse at 8, 12, 4, and 8 o'clock,
daily; movements of bowels; hours in open air; all food taken;
total amount of milk; total amount of oil and butter; appetite;
digestion; spirits; cough (amount, chief time); expectoration
(amount in 24 hours, color, nature); exercise (if allowed), with
temperature and pulse 15 minutes after exercise; sweats; visitors.

The following simple instructions can be followed in any home, even
where open windows must take the place of porches:

Rest out of doors is the medicine that cures consumption. Absolute
rest for mind and body brings speedy improvement. It [233]stops the
cough and promotes the appetite. The lungs heal more quickly when
the body is at rest. Lie with the chest low, so the blood flow in
the lungs will aid to the uttermost the work of healing. The rest
habit is soon acquired. Each day of rest makes the next day of
rest easier, and shortens the time necessary to regain health. The
more time spent in bed out of doors the better. Do not dress if
the temperature is above 99 degrees, or if there is blood in the
sputum. It is life in the open air, not exercise, that brings
health and strength. Just a few minutes daily exercise during the
active stage of the disease may delay recovery weeks or months.
Rest favors digestion, exercise frequently disturbs digestion.
When possible have meals served in bed. Never think the rest
treatment can be taken in a rocking-chair. If tired of the cot,
shift to the reclining chair, but sit with head low and feet
elevated. Do not write letters. Dictate to a friend. Do not read
much and do not hold heavy books. While reading remain in the
recumbent posture.




FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS IN DAY CAMPS       BOSTON


Once having learned the simple facts that must be noted and the simple
laws that must be followed, once [234]having placed oneself in a position
to secure the rest, the fresh air, and the health diet, no better next
steps can be taken than to observe the closing injunction in the rules
for rest:

There are few medicines better than clouds, and you have not to
swallow them or wear them as plasters,       only to watch them.
Keeping your eyes aloft, your thoughts will shortly clamber after
them, or, if they don't do that, the sun gets into them, and the
bad ones go a-dozing like bats and owls.




THE BACK OF A STREET-CAR TRANSFER, SUNDAYS, NEW YORK CITY


Important as are sanatoriums in mountain and desert, day or night
camps within and near cities, milk and egg clinics, home visiting,
change of air and rest for those who are known to be tuberculous,
their importance is infinitesimal compared with the protection that
comes from clean, healthy environment and natural living for those not
known to be tuberculous. This great fact has been recognized by the
various bodies now engaged in popularizing the truth about
tuberculosis by means of stationary and traveling exhibits,
illustrated lectures, street-car transfers, advertisements, farmers'
institutes, anti-spitting signs in public vehicles and public
buildings, board of health instructions in many languages, magazine
stories, and press reports of conferences. This brilliant campaign of
education shows what can be done by national, state, and county
superintendents of schools, if they will make the most of school
hygiene and civics.

[235]


AN EXAMPLE IN CO      PERATION THAT ANTI-TUBERCULOSIS CRUSADERS SHOULD FOLLOW


[236]Is it not significant that America's national movement is due
primarily to the organizing capacity of laymen in the New York Charity
Organization Society rather than to schools or hospitals? Most of the
local secretaries are men whose inspiration came from contact with the
non-medical relief of the poor in city tenements. The secretary of the
national association is a university professor of anthropology, who
has also a medical degree. The child victim's plea       Little Jo's
Smile       was nationalized by an association of laymen, aided by the
advertising managers of forty magazines. The smaller cities of New
York state are being aroused by a state voluntary association that for
years has visited almshouses, insane asylums, and hospitals. These
facts I emphasize, for they illustrate the opportunity and the duty of
the lay educator, whether parent, teacher, labor leader, or trustee of
hospital, orphanage, or relief society.

Three fundamental rules of action should be established as firmly as
religious principles:

1. The public health authorities should be told of every known and
every suspected case of tuberculosis.

2. For each case proved by examination of sputum to be
tuberculous, the public-health officers should know that the germs
are destroyed before being allowed to contaminate air or food.

3. Sick and not yet sick should practice habits of health that
build up vitality to resist the tubercle bacilli and that abhor
uncleanliness as nature abhors a vacuum.

[237]


FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS WITH A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION


All laws, customs, and environmental conditions opposed to the
enforcement of these three principles must be modified or abolished.
If the teachers of America will list for educational use in their own
communities the local obstacles to these rules of action, they will
see exactly where their local problem lies. The illustrations that are
given in this book show in how many ways these rules of action are now
being universalized. Three or four important steps deserve especial
comment:

1. Compulsory notification of all tuberculous cases.

2. Compulsory removal to hospital of those not able at home to
destroy the bacilli, or compulsory supervision of home care.

3. Examination of all members of a family where one member is
discovered to be tuberculous.

4. Special provision for tuberculous teachers.

5. Protection of children about to enter industry but predisposed
to tuberculosis.

6. Prohibition of dry cleaning of schools, offices, and streets.

7. Tax provision for educational and preventive work.

Compulsory notification was introduced first in New York City by
Hermann M. Biggs, M.D., chief medical [238]officer: 1893, partially
voluntary, partially compulsory; 1897, compulsory for all. Physicians
who now hail Dr. Biggs as a statesman called him persecutor, autocrat,
and violator of personal freedom fifteen years ago. Foreign
sanitarians vied with American colleagues in upbraiding him for his
exaggeration of the transmissibility of consumption and for his
injustice to its victims. As late as 1899 one British expert
particularly resented the rejection of tuberculous immigrants at Ellis
Island, and said to me, "Perhaps if you should open a man's mouth and
pour in tubercle bacilli he might get phthisis, but compulsory
notification is preposterous." In 1906 the International Congress on
Tuberculosis met in Paris and congratulated New York upon its
leadership in securing at health headquarters a list of the known
disease centers within its borders; in 1906 more than twenty thousand
individual cases were reported, ten thousand of these being reported
more than once. To know the nature and location of twenty thousand
germ factories is a long step toward judging their strength and their
probable product. To compulsory notification in New York City is
largely due the educational movements of the last decade against the
white plague, more particularly the growing ability among physicians
to recognize and to treat conditions predisposing to the disease. As
in New York City, the public should provide free of cost
bacteriological analysis of sputum to learn positively whether
tuberculosis is present. Simpler still is the tuberculin test of the
eyes, with which experiments are now being made on a large scale in
New York City, and which bids fair to become cheap enough to be
generally used wherever physical examinations are made. This test is
known as Calmette's Eye Test. Inside the eyelid is placed a drop of a
solution       95 per cent alcohol and tuberculin. If conjunctivitis
develops in twenty-four hours, the patient is proved to have
tuberculosis. Some physicians still fear to use this test. Others
question its proof. The "skin test" is also being thoroughly tried in
several American cities and, if finally found trustworthy, will
greatly simplify examination for tuberculosis. Dr. John W. Brannan,
president of Bellevue and Allied Hospitals, New York City, is to
report on skin and eye tuberculin tests for children at the
International Congress on Tuberculosis, mentioned later.

[239]


FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS BY ORGANIZED CO      PERATIVE DISPENSARY WORK





FIGHTING BONE TUBERCULOSIS AT SEA BREEZE, WHERE EYE AND SKIN TUBERCULIN TESTS ARE BEING MADE


[240]Compulsory removal of careless consumptives is yet rare. One obstacle
is the lack of hospitals. In New York ten thousand die annually from
tuberculosis and fifty thousand are known to have it, yet there are
only about two thousand beds available. So long as the patients
anxious for hospital care exceed the number of beds, it does not seem
fair to give a bed to some one who does not want it. On the other
hand, it should not be forgotten that patients are taken forcibly to
smallpox and scarlet-fever hospitals, not for their own good, but for
the protection of others. The last person who should be permitted to
stay at home is the tuberculous person who is unable, unwilling, or
too ignorant to take the necessary precautions for others'
[241]protection. A rigid educational test should be applied as a condition
of remaining at home without supervision.

The objections to compulsory removal are two: (1) it is desired to
make sanatorium care so attractive that patients will go at the
earliest stage of the disease; (2) an unwilling patient can defeat the
sanitarian's effort to help him and others. The alternative for
compulsory removal is gratuitous, and, if need be, compulsory,
supervision of home care, such as is now given in New York City. In
Brighton, England, Dr. Newsholme treats his municipal sanatorium as a
vacation school, giving each patient one month only. Thus one bed
helps twelve patients each year. Almost any worker can spare one month
and in that time can be made into a missionary of healthy living.

Family examining parties were begun in New York by Dr. Linsly R.
Williams, for the relief agency that started the seaside treatment of
bone tuberculosis. Many of the crippled children at Sea Breeze were
found to have consumptive fathers or mothers. In one instance the
father had died before Charlie had "hip trouble." Long after we had
known Charlie his mother began to fail. She too had consumption.
Family parties were planned for 290 families. Weights were taken and
careful examination made, the physician explaining that predisposition
means defective lung capacity or deficient vitality. Of 379 members,
supposedly free from tuberculosis, sixteen were found to have
well-marked cases. (Of twenty Boston children whose parents were in a
tuberculosis class, four had tuberculosis.) In one instance the father
was astonished to learn not only that he was tuberculous, but that he
had probably given the disease to the mother, for whom he was tenderly
concerned. Of special benefit were the talks about teeth and
nourishment, and about fresh air and water as germ killers. One
examination of this kind will organize a family crusade against
carelessness.

[242]


FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS IN SMALL CITIES
New York State Charities Aid Association


Tuberculous teachers ought to be excluded from schoolrooms not merely
because they may spread tuberculosis, but because they cannot do
justice to school work without sacrifices that society ought not to
accept. A tuberculous teacher ought to be generous enough to permit
public hospitals to restore her strength or enterprising enough [243]to
join tuberculosis classes. It is selfish to demand independence at the
price which is paid by schools that employ tuberculous teachers.




FIGHTING BONE TUBERCULOSIS WITH SALT WATER AND SALT AIR


Predisposition to tuberculosis should be understood by every child
before he is accepted as an industrial soldier. Many trades now
dangerous would be made safe if workers knew the risk they run, and if
society forbade such trades needlessly to exhaust their employees. A
perfectly sound man is predisposed to tuberculosis if he elects to
work in stale, dust-laden air. Ill-ventilated rooms, cramped
positions, lack of exercise in the open air, prepare lungs to give a
cordial reception to tubercle bacilli. Rooms as well as persons become
infected. Fortunately, opportunities to work are so varied in most
localities that workers predisposed to tuberculosis may be sure of a
livelihood in an occupation suited to their vitality. Destruction of
germs in the air, in carpets, on walls, on streets, is quite as
important as [244]destruction of germs in lungs. Why should not tenants
and workers require health certificates stating that neither house nor
working place is infected with tubercle bacilli? Some cities now
compel the disinfection of premises occupied by tuberculous persons
after their removal. Landlords, employers, tenants, and employees
can easily be taught to see the advantage of disinfecting premises
occupied by tuberculous cases before detection.




FIGHTING FEATHER DUSTERS IS ONE OBJECT OF SEA-AIR HOSPITALS FOR BONE TUBERCULOSIS


Dry cleaning, feather dusters, dust-laden air, will disappear from
schoolrooms within twenty-four hours after school-teachers declare
that they shall disappear. We have no right to expect street cleaners,
tenement and shop janitors, or overworked mothers to be more careful
than school-teachers. Last year I said to a janitress, "Don't you
realize that you may get consumption if you use that feather duster?"
Her reply caused us to realize our carelessness: "I don't want any
more than I've got now." Shall we some day have compulsory examination
and instruction of all cleaners, starting with school cleaners?

[245]


FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS IN OPEN TENTS


Taxing is swift to follow teaching in matters of health. Teachers can
easily compute what their community loses from tuberculosis. The
totals will for some time prove a convincing argument for cleanliness
of air, of body, and of building wherever the community is responsible
for air, building, and body. The annual cost of tuberculosis to New
York City is estimated at $23,000,000 and to the United States at
$330,000,000. The cost of exterminating it will be but a drop in the
bucket if school-teachers do their part this next generation with the
twenty million children whose day environment they control for three
fourths of the year, and whose habits they can determine.

The first meeting in America of the International Congress on
Tuberculosis was held at Washington, D.C., September 21 to October 12,
1908. For many years the [246]proceedings of this congress will
undoubtedly be the chief reference book on the conquest of
tuberculosis.[14]

How many aspects there are to this problem, and how many kinds of
people may be enlisted, may be seen from the seven section names: I.
Pathology and Bacteriology; II. Sanatoriums, Hospitals, and
Dispensaries; III. Surgery and Orthopedics; IV. Tuberculosis in
Children       Etiology, Prevention, and Treatment; V. Hygienic, Social,
Industrial, and Economic Aspects; VI. State and Municipal Control of
Tuberculosis; VII. Tuberculosis in Animals and Its Relation to Man.

[250]


BOSTON FIGHTS TUBERCULOSIS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
A-D, F, H-J, private hospitals and agencies reporting cases to the
official center; E, home care; K, L, M, day camp and hospitals for
incipient and advanced cases


A white-plague scrapbook containing news items, articles, and
photographs will prove an interesting aid to self-education or to
instruction of children, working girls' clubs, or mothers' meetings.
Everybody ought to enlist in this war, for the fight against
tuberculosis is a fight for cleanliness [251]and for vitality, for a fair
chance against environmental conditions prejudicial to efficient
citizenship.

So sure is the result and so immediate the duty of every citizen that
Dr. Biggs wrote in 1907: In no other direction can such large results
be achieved so certainly and at such relatively small cost. The time
is not far distant when those states and municipalities which have not
adopted a comprehensive plan for dealing with tuberculosis will be
regarded as almost criminally negligent in their administration of
sanitary affairs and inexcusably blind to their own best economic
interests.





FOOTNOTES:

[13] The best literature on tuberculosis is in current
magazines and reports of anti-tuberculosis crusaders. For a
scientific, comprehensive treatment, libraries and students should
have The Prevention of Tuberculosis (1908) by Arthur Newsholme, M.D.
A popular book is The Crusade against Tuberculosis, by Lawrence F.
Flick, of the Henry Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment, and
Prevention of Tuberculosis.

[14] Those desiring copies this year or hereafter will do
well to write to The National Association for the Study and Prevention
of Tuberculosis, 105 East 22d St., New York City. The congress is
under the control of the National Association and is managed by a
special committee appointed by it. Even after a national board of
health is established, the National Association for the Study and
Prevention of Tuberculosis will continue to be a center for private
interest in public protection against tuberculosis. One of its chief
functions is the preparation and distribution of literature to those
who desire it.

CHAPTER XXVToC

THE FIGHT FOR CLEAN MILK


"With the approval of the President and with the co      peration of the
Department of Agriculture,[15] the [national quarantine] service has
undertaken to prepare a complete report upon the milk industry from
farm to the consumer in its relation to the public health." This
promise of the United States Treasury insures national attention to
the evils of unclean milk and to the sanitary standards of farmer and
consumer. Nothing less than a national campaign can make the vivid
impression necessary to wean dairymen of uncleanly habits and mothers
of the ignorant superstition that babies die in summer just because
they are babies. When two national bureaus study, learn, and report,
newspapers will print their stories on the first page, magazines will
herald the conclusions, physicians will open their minds to new
truths, state health secretaries will carry on the propaganda,
demagogues and quacks will become less certain of their short-cut
remedies, and everybody will be made to think.

The evolution of this newly awakened national interest in clean milk
follows the seven stages and illustrates the seven health motives
presented in Chapter II. I give the story of Robert M. Hartley because
he began and prosecuted his pure-milk crusade in a way that can be
duplicated in any country town or small city.

Robert M. Hartley was a strong-bodied, strong-minded, country-bred
man, who started church work in New York City almost as soon as he
arrived. He distributed religious [253]tracts among the alleys and hovels
that characterized lower New York in 1825. Meeting drunken men and
women one after another, he first wondered whether they were helped by
tracts, and then decided that the mind befogged with alcohol was unfit
to receive the gospel message. Then for fifteen years he threw himself
into a total-abstinence crusade, distributing thousands of pamphlets,
calling in one year at over four thousand homes to teach the
industrial and moral reasons for total abstinence. Finally, he began
to wonder whether back of alcoholism there was not still a dark closet
that must be explored before men could receive the message of religion
and self-control. So in 1843 he organized the New York Association for
Improving the Condition of the Poor, which ever since has remembered
how Hartley found alcoholism back of irreligion, and how back of
alcoholism and poverty and ignorant indifference [254]he found indecent
housing, unsanitary streets, unwholesome working conditions, and
impure food.




FIGHTING INFANT MORTALITY BY A SCHOOL FOR MOTHERS IN
THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY,       JUNIOR SEA BREEZE





PROVIDING AGAINST GERM GROWTH AND ADAPTING MILK TO THE
INDIVIDUAL BABY'S NEED,       ROCHESTER'S MODEL DAIRY


Hartley's instinct started the first great pure-milk agitation in this
country. While visiting a distillery for the purpose of trying to
persuade the owner to invest his money in another business, he noticed
that "slops smoking hot from the stills" were being carried to cow
stables. He followed and was nauseated by the sights and odors.
Several hundred uncleaned cows in low, suffocating, filthy stables
were being fed on "this disgusting, unnatural food." Similar disgust
has in many other American cities caused the first effort to better
dairy conditions. Hartley could never again enjoy milk from distillery
cows. Furthermore, his story of 1841 made it impossible for any
readers of newspapers in New York to enjoy milk until assured that it
was not produced by distillery slops. The instinctive loathing and the
discomfort of buyers awakened the commerce motives of milk dealers,
who covered their wagons with signs declaring that they "no longer" or
"never" fed cows on distillery refuse. But Hartley could not stop when
the anti-nuisance stage was reached. He did not let up on his fight
against impure or adulterated milk until the state legislature
declared in 1864 that every baby, city born or country born, no
matter how humble its home, has the right to pure milk.

[255]




[256]




[257]




[258]Unfortunately Hartley and his contemporaries had never heard of
disease germs that are carried by unclean milk into the human stomach.
Science had not yet proved that many forms of barnyard filth could do
quite as much harm as distillery refuse. Commerce had not invented
milk bottles of glass or paper. The law of 1864 failed in two
particulars: (1) it did not demand cleanliness from cow to consumer;
(2) it did not provide means for its own enforcement, for learning
whether everything and everybody that had to do with milk was clean.
Not knowing of germs and their love for a warm climate and warm food,
they naturally did not prohibit a temperature above fifty degrees from
the time of milking to the time of sale. How much has been left for
our generation to do to secure pure milk is illustrated by the opening
sentence of this chapter, and more specifically by the programme of a
milk conference held in New York in November, 1906, the board of
health joining in the call. The four-page folder is reproduced in
facsimile (excepting the names on the fourth page), because it states
the universal problem, and also because it suggests an effective way
to stimulate relevant discussion and to discourage the long speeches
that spoil many conferences.

This conference led to the formation of a milk committee under the
auspices of the association founded by Hartley. Business men,
children's specialists, journalists, clergymen, consented to serve
because they realized the need for a continuing public interest and a
persisting watchfulness. Such committees are needed in other cities
and in states, either as independent committees or as subcommittees of
general organizations, such as women's clubs, sanitary leagues, county
and state medical societies. Teachers' associations might well [259]be
added, especially for rural and suburban districts where they are more
apt than any other organized body to see the evils that result from
unclean milk. The New York Milk Committee set a good example in paying
a secretary to give his entire time to its educational programme,       a
paid secretary can keep more volunteers and consultants busy than
could a dozen volunteers giving "what time they can spare." Thanks
chiefly to the conference and the Milk Committee's work, several
important results have been effected. The general public has realized
as never before that two indispensable adjectives belong to safe
milk,       clean and cool. Additional inspectors have been sent to
country dairies; refrigeration, cans, and milk have been inspected
upon arrival at night; score cards have been introduced, thanks to the
convincing explanations of their effectiveness by the [260]representatives
of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the national Department of
Agriculture; 8640 milch cows were inspected by veterinary
practitioners (1905-1907), to learn the prevalence of bovine
tuberculosis (of these thirty-six per cent reacted to the tuberculin
test); state societies and state departments have been aroused to
demand an efficient live-stock sanitary board; magistrates have fined
and imprisoned offenders against the milk laws, where formerly they
"warned"; popular illustrated milk lectures were added to the public
school courses; illustrated cards were distributed by the thousand,
telling how to keep the baby well; finally, private educational and
relief societies, dispensaries, settlements, have been increasingly
active in teaching mothers at home how to prepare baby's milk. In 1908
a Conference on Summer Care of Babies was organized representing the
departments of health and education, and fifty private agencies for
the care of sick babies and the instruction of mothers. The
superintendent of schools instructed teachers to begin the campaign by
talks to children and by giving out illustrated cards. Similar
instructions were sent to parochial schools by the archbishop.




NIGHT INSPECTION OF COUNTRY MILK UPON ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK CITY


As elsewhere, there are two schools of pure-milk crusaders: (1) those
who want cities to do things, to pasteurize all milk, start milk
farms, milk shops, or pure-milk dispensaries; and (2) those who want
cities and states to get things done. So far the New York Milk
Committee has led the second school and has opposed efforts to
municipalize the milk business. The leader of the other school is the
noted philanthropist, Nathan Strauss, who has established
pasteurization plants in several American and European cities. The
discussion of the two schools, similar in aim but different in method,
is made more difficult, because to question philanthropy's method
always seems to philanthropy itself and to most bystanders an
ungracious, ungrateful act. As the issue, however, is clean milk, not
personal motive, it is important [261]that educators and parents in all
communities benefit from the effective propaganda of both schools,
using what is agreed upon as the basis for local pure-milk crusades,
reserving that which is controversial for final settlement by research
over large fields that involve hundreds of thousands of tests.




A NEW YORK MILK COMMITTEE'S INFANT DEPOT AND SCHOOL FOR MOTHERS


Pasteurization, municipal dairies, municipal milk shops, municipal
infant-milk depots, are the four chief remedies of the doing things
school. European experience is cited in support of each. We are told
that cow's milk, intended by nature for an infant cow with four
stomachs, is not suited, even when absolutely pure, to the human
infant's single stomach. Cow's milk should be modified, weakened,
diluted, to fit the digestive powers of the individual infant; hence
the municipal depot or milk dispensary that provides exactly the right
milk for each baby, prescribed by municipal physicians and nurses who
know. That the well-to-do and the just-past-infancy may have milk as
safe as babies receive [262]at the depot, municipalization of farm and
milk shop is advocated. Some want the city to run only enough farms
and milk shops to set a standard for private farmers, as has been done
in Rochester. This is city ownership and operation for educational
purposes only. Finally, because raw milk even from clean dairies may
contain germs of typhoid, scarlet fever, or tuberculosis,
pasteurization is demanded to kill every germ. There are advocates of
pasteurization that deprecate the practice and deny that raw milk is
necessarily dangerous; they favor it for the time being until farms
and shops have acquired habits of cleanliness. Likewise many would
prefer private pasteurization or laws compelling pasteurization of all
milk offered for sale; but they despair of obtaining safe milk unless
city officials are held [263]responsible for safety. Why wait to discuss
political theories about the proper sphere for government, when, by
acting, hundreds of thousands of lives can be saved annually? These
methods of doing things will not add to the price of milk; it is, in
fact, probable that the reduction in the cost of caring for the sick
and for inspecting farms and shops will offset the net cost of depots,
farms, and dairies.




ONE OF ROCHESTER'S SCHOOLS IN CLEANLINESS





ROCHESTER'S MODEL DAIRY FARM


As to pasteurization, its cost is negligible, while the cost of
cleanliness is two, four, or ten cents a quart. Whether ideally clean
milk is safe or not, raw milk that is not clean is unfit for human
consumption. All cities should compel evidence of pasteurization as a
condition of sale. Large cities should have their own pasteurizing
plants, just as many cities now have their own vaccine farms and
antitoxin laboratories. Parents in small towns and in the country
should be taught to pasteurize all milk.

The getting things done school admits the need for modified milk of
strength suited to the infant's stomach; affirms the danger of milk
that contains harmful germs; demands educational work by city, state,
and nation; confesses that [264]talk about cleanliness will not make milk
safe. On the other hand, it denies that raw milk is necessarily
dangerous; that properly modified, clean, raw milk is any safer when
pasteurized; that talking about germ-proof milk insures germ
extinction. It maintains that pasteurization kills benign germs
essential to the life of milk, and that after benign germs are killed,
pasteurized milk, if exposed to infection, is more dangerous than raw
milk, for the rapid growth of harmful germs is no longer contested by
benign germs fighting for supremacy. While it is admitted that raw
milk produced under ideal conditions may become infected by some
person ignorant of his condition, and before detection may cause
typhoid, scarlet fever, or consumption, it has not been proved that
such instances are frequent or that the aggregate of harm done equals
that which pasteurized milk may do. Pasteurization does not remove
chemical impurities; boiling dirt does not render it harmless. The
remedy for germ-infected milk is to keep germs out of milk. The remedy
for unclean milk is cleanliness of cow, cow barn, cowyard, milker,
milk can, creamery, milk shop, bottle, nipple. If the sale of unclean
milk is prevented, farmers will, as a matter of course, supply clean
milk. By teaching farmers and milk retailers the economic advantages
of cleanliness they will cultivate habits that guarantee a clean milk
supply. By punishing railroads and milk companies that transport milk
at a temperature which encourages germ growth, and by dumping in the
gutter milk that is offered for sale above 50 degrees, the
refrigerating of milk will be made the rule. Purging magistrates'
courts of their leniency toward dealers in impure, dangerous milk is
better than purging milk of germs. Boiling milk receptacles will save
more babies than boiling milk. Teaching mothers about the care of
babies will bring better results than giving them a false sense of
safety, because only one of many dangers has been removed by
pasteurization. Educating consumers to demand [265]clean milk and to
support aggressive work by health departments leaves fewer evils
unchecked than covering up uncleanliness by pasteurization.




NEW YORK MILK COMMITTEE'S GRAPHIC METHOD OF SHOWING BABIES' PROGRESS





PRODUCING WINTER CONDITIONS IN MIDSUMMER BY PROPER REFRIGERATION FOR MILK IN FREIGHT CARS


When doctors disagree what are we laymen to do? We can take an
intelligent interest in the inquiries that are now being made by city,
state, and national governments. Because everybody believes that clean
milk is safer than unclean milk, that milk at 50 degrees will not
breed harmful germs, we can demand milk inspection that will tell our
health officers and ourselves which dealers sell only clean milk at 50
degrees and never more than 60 degrees, that never shows over 100,000
colonies to the cubic centimeter. We can get our health departments to
publish the results of their scoring of dairies and milk shops in the
papers, as has been done in Montclair. We can tell our health officers
that the best results in fighting infant mortality are at Rochester,
which city, winter and summer, [266]by inspection, correspondence, and
punishment, educates farmers and dealers in cleanliness, not only
censuring when dirty or careless, but explaining how to make more
money by being clean. Finally, mothers can be taught at home how to
cleanse the bottles, the nipples, all milk receptacles, and all things
in rooms where milk is kept. Absolutely clean milk of proper
temperature at the shop may not safely be given to a baby in a dirty
bottle. Infant milk depots, pasteurization, the best medical and
hospital care, breast feeding itself, cannot prevent high baby
mortality if mothers are not clean. The most effective volunteer
effort for pure milk is that which first makes the health machinery do
its part and then teaches, teaches, teaches mothers and all who have
to do with babies.




NEITHER PASTEURIZATION NOR INSPECTION CAN MAKE IT SAFE TO SELL "DIP MILK" UNDER SUCH UNCLEAN CONDITIONS


[267]"Clean air, clean babies, clean milk," has been the slogan of Junior
Sea Breeze,       a school for mothers right in the heart of New York's
upper East Side. In the summer of 1907 twenty nurses went from house
to house telling 102,000 mothers how to keep the baby well. This was
the only district that had fewer baby deaths than for 1906. Had other
parts of the city shown the same gain, there would have been a saving
of 1100 babies. The following winter a similar work was conducted by
nurses from the recently founded Caroline Rest, which has an
educational fund for instruction of mothers in the care of babies,
especially babies not yet born and just born. Heretofore the baby has
been expected to cry and to have summer complaint before anybody
worried about the treatment it received. If the baby lived through its
second summer, it was considered great good fortune. Junior Sea Breeze
and Caroline Rest start their educational work before the baby is
sick, in fact, before it is born. Their results have been so notable
that several well-to-do mothers declare that they wish they too might
have a school. Dispensaries and diet kitchens and more particularly
maternity wards of hospitals, family physicians, nurses, and midwives,
should be required to know how to teach mothers to feed babies
regularly, the right quantities, under conditions that insure
cleanliness whether the breast or the bottle is used. Perhaps some day
no girl will be given a graduating certificate, or a license for work,
teaching, or marriage, until she has demonstrated her ability to give
some mother's baby "clean air, clean body, clean milk."

CHAPTER XXVIToC

PREVENTIVE "HUMANIZED" MEDICINE: PHYSICIAN AND TEACHER


No profession, excepting possibly the ministry, is regarded with
greater deference than the medical profession. Our ancestors listened
with awe and obedience to the warnings and behests of the medicine
man, bloodletter, bonesetter, family doctor. In modern times doctors
have disagreed with each other often enough to warrant laymen in
questioning the infallibility of any individual healer or any sect,
whether homeopath, allopath, eclectic, osteopath, or scientist. Yet to
this day most of us surround the medical profession or the healing art
with an atmosphere of necromancy. Even after we have given up faith in
drugs or after belief is denied in the reality of disease and pain, we
revere the calling that concerns itself, whether gratuitously or for
pay, with conquering bodily ills.

Self-laudation continues this hold of the medical profession upon the
lay imagination. One physician may challenge another's faults,
ridicule his remedies, call his antitoxin dangerous poison, but their
common profession he proudly styles "the most exalted form of
altruism." Young men and women beginning the study or the practice of
medicine are exhorted to continue its traditions of self-denial, and
in their very souls to place human welfare before personal or
pecuniary advancement. Newspapers repeat exhortation and laudation. We
laymen pass on the story that we know is not universally
true,       physicians know, physicians apply what they know without
consciousness of error, physicians must be implicitly trusted.

[269]For a physician to give poison when he means to give food is worse,
not better, than for a layman to make the same mistake. Neither the
moral code nor the law of self-preservation enjoins a tuberculous
mother to take alcohol or to sleep in an unventilated room, even if an
uninformed physician prescribes it. Instruction in physiology and
hygiene would be futile if those who are educated as to the elementary
facts of hygiene and physiology must blindly follow blind physicians.
A family doctor who gives cod-liver oil for an       mia due to adenoids may
do a child as much harm as a nurse who drugs the baby to make it
sleep. The physician who refuses to tell the board of health when
smallpox or typhoid fever first breaks out takes human life just as
truly as if he tore up the tracks in front of an express train. This
is another way of saying that parents and teachers must fit themselves
to know whether the family physician and their community's physicians
are efficient practitioners and teachers. Every one can learn enough
about the preventable causes of sickness and depleted vitality to
insist upon the ounce of education and prevention that is better than
a pound of cure.

For its sins of omission, as for its sins of commission, the medical
profession shares responsibility with laymen. For years leading
educators, business men, hospital directors, public officials, have
known that communicable diseases could be stamped out. The methods
have been demonstrated. There is absolutely no excuse to-day for
epidemics of typhoid in Trenton, Pittsburg, or Scranton, for epidemics
of scarlet fever in the small towns of Minnesota, for uninterrupted
epidemics of tuberculosis everywhere. Had either laymen, physicians,
or school-teachers made proper use of the knowledge that has been in
text-books for a generation, this country would be saving thousands of
lives and millions of dollars every year. Our doing and getting
done have lagged behind our knowing.

[270]The failure of physicians to "socialize" or "humanize" their knowledge
is due to two causes: (1) no one has been applying result tests to
the profession as a whole and to the state in its capacity as doctor,
testing carefully the sickness rate, the death rate, and the expense
rate of preventable diseases; (2) physicians themselves have not
needed to know, either at college or in practice, the tax levied upon
their communities by preventable sickness. Public schools can do much
to secure result tests for individual physicians, for the profession
as a whole, and for boards of health. Schooling in preventive
medicine, or, better named, schooling in preventive hygiene, will fit
physicians to do their part in eradicating preventable disease.

Preventive hygiene is not an essential part of the training of
American physicians or nurses to-day. Not only are there no colleges
of preventive hygiene, but medical schools have not provided
individual courses. It is possible for a man to graduate with honors
from our leading medical colleges without knowing what "vital
statistics" means. Even boards of health, their duties and their
educational opportunities, are not understood by graduates; it is an
accident if the "social and economic aspects of medical practice,"
"statistical fallacies," "hospital administration," "infant
mortality," are familiar terms. It is for this reason, rather than
because physicians are selfish, that indispensable and beneficent
legislation is so generally opposed by them when the prerogatives of
their profession seem in danger. Practically every important sanitary
advance of the past century has been fought at the outset by those
whose life work should have made them see the need. Physicians
bitterly attacked compulsory vaccination, medical inspection of
schools, compulsory notification of communicable diseases. What is
perhaps more significant of the physician's indifference to preventive
hygiene is the fact that most of the sanitary movements that have
[271]revolutionized hygienic conditions in America owe their inception and
their success to laymen, for example, tenement-house reform,
anti-child labor and anti-tuberculosis crusades, welfare work in
factories, campaigns for safety appliances, movement for a national
board of health, prison, almshouse, and insane-asylum reform, schools
for mothers, and milk committees. The first hospital for infectious
diseases, the first board of health, the first out-of-door sea-air
treatment of bone tuberculosis in the United States, were the result
of lay initiative.

Dr. Hermann M. Biggs says that in America the greatest need of the
medical profession and of health administration is training that will
enable physicians and lay inspectors to use their knowledge of
preventive hygiene for the removal of living and working conditions
that cause preventable sickness. A physician without knowledge of
preventive hygiene is simply doing a "general repair" business.

For a few months in 1907 New York City had a highly efficient
commissioner of street cleaning, who, in spite of the unanimous
protests and appeals of the press, refused to give up the practice of
medicine. Hitherto the board of health of that city has been unable to
obtain the full time of its physicians because professional standards
give greater credit to the retail application of remedies than to the
wholesale application of preventives.

Statesmanship as well as professional ability is expected of
physicians in the leading European cities, more particularly of those
connected with health departments. There it is not felt that a medical
degree is of itself a qualification for sanitary or health work. After
the professional course, physicians must take courses in preventive
hygiene and in health administration. Medical courses include such
subjects as vital statistics, duties of medical officers of health,
sanitary legislation, state medicine.

[272]The needless cost for one year of "catching" diseases in New York City
would endow in perpetuity all the schools and lectureships and
journals necessary to teach preventive hygiene in every section of
this great country. That city alone sacrifices twenty-eight thousand
lives annually to diseases that are officially called preventable. The
yearly burial cost of these victims of professional and community
neglect is more than a million dollars. When to the doctor bills,
wages lost, burial cost of those who die are added the total doctor
bills, wages lost, and other expenses of the sick who do not die, we
find that one city loses in dollars and cents more every year from
communicable diseases than is spent by the whole United States for
hospitals and boards of health.

Many diseases and much sickness are preventable that are not
communicable. Indigestion due to bad teeth is not itself communicable,
but it can be prevented. One's vitality may be sapped by irregular
eating or too little sleep; others will not catch the trouble,
although too often they imitate the harmful habits. Adenoids and
defective vision are preventable, but not contagious. Spinal curvature
and flat foot are unnecessary, but others cannot catch them.
Preventive hygiene, however, should teach the physician's duty to
educate his patient and his community regarding all controllable
conditions that injure or promote the health.

In the absence of special attention to preventive medicine new truth
is forced to fight its way, sometimes for generations, before it is
accepted by the medical profession. So strong are the traditions of
that profession and so difficult is it for the unconventional or
heterodox individual to retain the confidence of conservative
patients, that the forces of honorable medical practice tend to
discourage research and invention. The man who discovers a surgical
appliance is forced by the ethics of his profession either [273]to
commercialize it and lose his professional standing, or to abide the
convenience of his colleagues and their learned organizations in
testing it. Rather than be branded a quack, charlatan, or crank, the
physician keeps silent as to convictions which do not conform to the
text-books. Many a life-saving, health-promoting discovery which ought
to be taken up and incorporated into general practice from one end of
the country to the other, and which should be made a part of the
minimum standard of medical practice and medical agreement, must wait
twenty-five or fifty years for recognition.




THE DISCIPLE OF FRESH AIR AND HOME INSTRUCTION IS STILL AN OUTCAST IN SCORES OF HOSPITALS


For want of a school of preventive medicine to emphasize universally
every new truth, the medical colleges are permitted to remain
twenty-five or fifty years behind absolutely demonstrated facts as to
medical truth and medical [274]practice. In 1761 a German physician,
Avenbruger, after discovering that different sounds revealed diseased
tissue, used "chest tapping" in the diagnosis of lung trouble. In 1815
L      annec discovered that sound from the chest was more distinct through
a paper horn. On that principle the modern stethoscope is built. He
made an accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis, and while suffering from
that disease treated himself as a living clinical study. In 1857
Pasteur proved the presence of germs "without which no putrefaction,
no fermentation, no decay of tissue takes place." In 1884 Trudeau
started the first out-of-door care of pulmonary tuberculosis in
America. In 1892 Biggs secured the compulsory notification of
pulmonary tuberculosis. In 1904 began our first out-of-door sea-air
treatment for bone tuberculosis. Yet there are thousands of physicians
to-day who sincerely believe that they are earning their fees, who,
from houses shut up like ovens, give advice to patients for treatment
of tuberculosis, who prescribe alcohol and drugs, who diagnose the
disease as malaria for fear patients will be scared, who oppose
compulsory registration, and who never look for the tuberculous origin
of crippled children. Just think of its being possible, in 1908, for a
tuberculous young man of thirty to pay five dollars a day to a
sanatorium whose chief reliance is six doses of drugs a day!

In 1766 America's first dentist came to the United States. By 1785
itinerant dentists had built up a lucrative practice. In 1825 a course
of lectures on dentistry was delivered before the medical class at the
University of Maryland. As early as 1742 treatises were written "Upon
Dentition and the Breeding of Teeth in Children." In 1803 the
possibility of correcting irregularities was pointed out, as was the
pernicious effect of tartar on the teeth in 1827. In 1838 attempts
were made to abolish, "in all common cases, the pernicious habit of
tooth drawing." In 1841 treatises were written on the importance of
regulating [275]the teeth of children before the fourteenth year and on
the importance of preserving the first teeth. Yet in 1908 it is
necessary to write the chapter on Dental Sanitation. Few physicians,
whether in private practice or hospitals or just out of medical
college, consider it necessary to know the conditions of the mouth
before prescribing drugs for physical illness.

Osteopathy furnishes an up-to-date illustration. Discredited by the
medical profession, by medical journals and medical schools, it has in
fifteen years built up a practice of eight thousand men, having from
one to three years' training, including over one hundred physicians
with full medical training plus a course in osteopathy. There were
means of learning fifteen years ago what was truth and what was
quackery about the practice of osteopathy. By refusing to look for its
truth and by concentrating attention upon its quackery the medical
profession has lost fifteen years. Whereas the truth of osteopathy
should have been adopted by the medical colleges and a knowledge of
its possibilities and limitations required of every practicing
physician, a position has been reached where alleged quackery seems in
several important points to be discrediting the sincerity, the
intelligence, and the efficiency of orthodox medicine. No appeal to
the natural can be stronger, no justification of schools of preventive
medicine more complete, than the following paragraph from an
osteopathic physician who is among the small number who, having both
the medical and osteopathic degrees, see both the possibilities and
limitations of manual surgery and demand the inclusion of this new
science in the medical curriculum.

The physical method of treating disease presents a tremendous and
significant departure from the empiricism of medicine and the
experimentation of dietetics, the restricted fields of
electricity, suggestion, water cures, and massage. The patient as
an individual is not treated; the disease as a disease is not
treated; the [276]symptoms are not treated; but the entire physical
organism, with its many parts and diverse functions, is
exhaustively examined until each and every abnormal condition,
whether of structure or of function, causing disease and
maintaining symptoms, is found and administered to with the skill
of a definite art, based upon the data of an exact science.

Likewise the truths underlying Christian Science have been disdained
by medical schools and medical experts, just as its spiritual truth
has been disdained by religious leaders, until it has grown to such
strength that laymen are almost forced to question the sincerity and
the efficacy of the conventional in religion as well as medicine. In
May, 1907, the Emmanuel Church in Boston organized a clinic for the
purpose of utilizing for neurasthenics particularly both the spiritual
and the physical truths underlying religion and the various branches
of medical science. Daily papers and magazines are giving a great deal
of space to this experiment in "psychotherapy," which is discussed in
the chapter on Mental Hygiene. Schools and chairs in preventive
hygiene would soon give to the medical profession a point of view that
would welcome every new truth, such as the alliance of religion and
medicine, and estimate its full worth promptly. Truth seeking would be
not only encouraged but made a condition of professional standing.

Just what attitude any particular physician takes can be learned by
the teacher or parents whose children he treats. If he pooh-poohs or
resents board of health regulations as to isolation of scarlet-fever
patients, he is a dangerous man, no matter how noble his personal
character. If he says cross-eyes will straighten, weak eyes will
strengthen, or nose-stopping adenoids "absorb," he is bound to do
harm. If he says tuberculosis is incurable, noncommunicable,
hereditary, or curable by drugs, or if he tries to cure cancer by
osteopathy, he can do more injury than an insane criminal. If he fails
to teach a mother how to bathe, feed, [277]and clothe the baby, how to
ventilate a room for the sick or the well, he is an expensive luxury
for family or for school, and belongs to an age that knew neither
school nor preventive hygiene. If he takes no interest in health
administration; if he overlooks unclean milk or unclean streets, open
sewers, and unsanitary school buildings, street cars, churches, and
theaters; if he does not help the health board, the public hospitals,
the schools, the factory, and tenement departments enforce sanitary
laws, he is derelict as a citizen and as a member of an "exalted
profession." [278]If he sees only the patients he himself treats or one
particular malady, he is derelict as a teacher, no matter how charming
his personality or how skilled in his specialty. If a school physician
is slovenly in his work, if he spends fifteen minutes when he is paid
for an hour, should the efficient school-teacher conceal the fact from
her superiors because he is a physician? If private hospitals
misrepresent facts or compromise with political evils for the sake of
a gift of public money, their offense is more heinous because of their
exalted purpose. The test of a physician's worth to his patients and
to his community is not what he is or what he has learned, and not
what his profession might be, but what happens to patient and to
community. Human welfare demands that the medical profession be judged
by what it does, not by what it might do if it made the best possible
use of its knowledge or its opportunity.




TOO MANY PHYSICIANS AND EVEN MATERNITY HOSPITALS FAIL TO TEACH MOTHERS, EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER BABIES ARE BORN
Caroline Rest Educational Fund was given to show the value of such teaching


A dispensary that treats more patients than it can care for properly
is no better than a street-car company that chronically provides too
few seats and too many straps. Unless physicians test themselves and
their profession by results, we shall be compelled to "municipalize
the medical man." Preventable sickness costs too much, causes too much
wretchedness, and hampers too many modern educational and industrial
activities to be neglected. If the medical profession does not fit
itself to serve general interests, then cities, counties, and states
will take to themselves the cure as well as the prevention of
communicable and other preventable sickness. Human life and public
health are more precious than the medical profession, more important
even than theories and traditions against public interference in
private matters. The unreasoning opposition of medical men to
government protection of health, their concentration on cure, and
their tardy emphasis on prevention have forced many communities to
stumble into the evil practices mentioned in Chapter XVI.
Incidentally, [279]the best physicians have learned that the prosperity of
their profession increases with every increase in the general standard
of living. It is the man in the ten-room house not the man in one room
who supports physicians in luxury. It is the healthy man and the
healthy community that value efficient medical service.

Many American cities maintain dispensaries and hospitals for the poor.
Whether they will go to the logical conclusion of engaging physicians
to give free treatment to all regardless of income depends largely
upon what the next generation of private physicians do. The state
already says when a physician's training fits him to practice. It will
soon expect him to pass rigid examinations in the social and economic
aspects of his profession,       its educational opportunity, vital
statistics, sick and death rates. Will it need to municipalize him in
order to protect itself?

Obviously the teacher or parent should not begin cooperation with
physicians by lecturing them or by assuming that they are selfish and
unwilling to teach. The best first step is to ask questions that they
should be able to answer:

What causes cholera morbus or summer complaint? When does milk
harm the baby? How can unclean milk be made safe? Whose fault is
it that the milk is sold unclean and too warm? What agencies help
sick babies? What is the health board doing to teach mothers?

Or, if a school physician, the teacher can ask:

Why not remove these adenoids? What causes them? When will they
disappear by absorption? What harm can they do in the meantime?
How long would an operation take? Would it hurt very much? What
would be the immediate effects? Why not act at once? What
provisions are there in town for such operations? Why have the
physicians paid so little attention to breathing troubles? What
could your state do to interest physicians in school hygiene? Will
the school physician talk to a [280]mothers' meeting? What agencies
will give outings to sick children? What dispensaries are
accessible? Who is the proper person to organize a public health
league?

Physicians love to teach. If teachers and parents will love to learn
and will ask the right questions, all physicians can be converted into
hygiene missionaries, heralds of a statesmanship that guarantees
health rights to all.



Licensing the Practitioner

Three parties are interested in setting a high standard for
physicians, dentists, druggists, nurses, and veterinary surgeons       the
profession itself, the schools that educate, and the general public on
whom the arts are practiced. The schools and the practitioners are,
for the most part, primarily interested in protecting a monopoly of
skill. Their interest in restrictive legislation is analogous to that
of the labor union which limits the number of apprentices. This trade
unionism among professional colleges and professional graduates of
these colleges has gradually developed a higher and higher standard
that results in greater protection to the public. The first step is
generally to demand that all persons entering a profession after a
given date shall prove to the state their ability to "practice"
without injury to clients. It is almost impossible to get such laws
through unless the original law exempts all persons by whatever name,
who are practicing the art in question at the time the law is passed.
Whether we are speaking of medicine, law, dentistry, accountancy,
osteopathy, or barbering, this has been the history of compulsory
restriction and of state examinations.

As with regard to most other legislation, the enforcement of the law
lags behind its definition. Moreover nothing is done after a man has
passed a certain examination to see that he remains fit and safe to
treat the public. Because no supervision is provided except on the day
of [281]examination, it is possible for men and women to fill their brains
for a week or two weeks with the information necessary to pass what
coaches and tutors have learned will, in all probability, be asked.
Forever after, the public is left to protect itself. Out of this
condition have arisen the evil, unethical, and unprofessional
practices represented particularly by painless dentists, by ignorant
or dishonest physicians, and by osteopaths and careless nurses.

The machinery for preventing these evils is discussed in Chapter XXIX.
Suffice it here to present to parents and teachers the need for
examination in advance of certification that will show whether or not
those who make a livelihood by caring for others' health are equipped
to mitigate rather than aggravate evils, and for further tests by
which the public can learn from time to time which, among those
professional men who are protected by the public against competition,
continue to be safe. Finally, if, as will be clearly seen, it is
desirable that what we call professional ethics persist and that
self-advertisement be discouraged, society must, for its own
protection, adopt some other means than epithets to correct the evils
of self-advertisement and quackery. Even though we admit the
responsibility of each citizen when he goes to the house of a private
practitioner who has made no other effort to lure him thither than to
place a card in the window, it must be seen that we cannot hold
responsible for their choice men and women who receive through
newspapers, magazines, or circulars convincing notices that Dr.
So-and-So or the Integrity Company or the Peerless Dental Parlor will
place at their disposal, at prices within their reach, skill and
devotion absolutely beyond their reach at the office of an efficient
private practitioner. Some way must be found by which departments of
health will currently impose tests of methods and results upon
physicians, opticians, pharmacists, manufacturers of medicine, and
dentists.

[282]As laymen become more intelligent regarding their own bodies and
healthy living, it grows harder and harder for quacks and incompetents
to mislead and exploit them. Better than any possible outside
safeguard is hygienic living. Fortunately, we can all learn the simple
tests of environment and of living necessary to the selection of
physicians, dentists, and opticians, or other "architects of health"
whose efficiency and integrity are beyond question.

PART IV. OFFICIAL MACHINERY FOR ENFORCING HEALTH RIGHTS



CHAPTER XXVIIToC

DEPARTMENTS OF SCHOOL HYGIENE


The term "school hygiene" generally suggests no other school than the
public school. State laws say nothing about compulsory hygiene in
military academies, ladies' seminaries, or other preparatory and
finishing schools. Yet when one thinks of it, one must conclude that
the right to health and to healthful school environment cannot
equitably be confined to the children whose tuition is given at public
expense. There is a better way to check "swollen" fortunes than by
ruining the health of "fortune's children." The waste and danger of
slow-minded, noticeably inefficient children are no less when parents
are rich than when parents are poor. There is no justification for
neglecting the health of children in parochial schools, in private
schools for the well-to-do or rich, or in commercial schools for the
ambitious youth of lower income strata. Nor has the commercial,
parochial, private school, or college, any clearer right than the
public school to injure or to fail to promote pupils' health. So far
as school hygiene is advisable, so far as it is right to make hygiene
compulsory, its personal and social benefits should be shared by
children of school age without regard to income, and its laws should
be enforced by all teachers, principals, and officers that have [284]to do
with school. In presenting a programme for school hygiene this chapter
refers to the hygiene taught, the hygiene practiced, the hygiene not
taught, and the hygiene not practiced in buildings and on grounds
where children and youth are at school, whether these children are in
kindergarten or high school, in reformatory or military academy, in
charitable school, or in finishing and preparing center for society's
juniors.

The question of the local, state, and national machinery by which
proper standards of school hygiene shall be made effective will be
taken up after we have considered individual steps in a comprehensive
programme for school hygiene.

1. Thorough physical examination of all candidates for teachers'
positions and periodic re      xamination of accepted teachers.

Teachers would be grateful to be told in time their own physical needs
and the relations of their vitality to the vitality of their pupils.
Are your teachers examined? Do they know the laws of health and the
signs of child health? Are they permitted to continue in schoolrooms
after tuberculosis is discovered? Are normal graduates given physical
tests before being permitted to teach and before being permitted to
give four years to preparation for teaching?

2. Thorough physical examination of every single child in every
single school upon entering and periodically during school life.

We believe a vast number of things that "ain't so" about the health of
country children as compared with city children, of private-school
children as compared with public-school children. Where do we find
more degenerate men, physically and morally, than in so-called
"American settlements," where, for generations, children have had all
outdoors to play in, except when in homes and schoolhouses that are
seldom cleansed and seldom ventilated? Open [285]mouths and closed minds
clog the "little red schoolhouse"; there headaches do not suggest eye
strain; there deafness and running ears are frankly attributed to
scarlet fever which everybody must have with all the other "catching"
diseases, the earlier the better; there colds begin in December and
run until March, to the serious injury of attendance and promotion
records; there bone tuberculosis is called "knee trouble" or "spine
trouble in the family"; there boys like my little friend Fred count
the bottles of cod-liver oil they take to cure adenoids that could be
removed in two minutes.

The index to community life and community living conditions should be
read in the country, not only for the country's sake, but also for the
sake of the city whose milk and water, poisoned in the country, cause
thousands of deaths annually, besides annual sick bills exceeding many
times over the Russell Sage and Carnegie Foundations, which we rightly
call munificent. Reading the index of private schools and colleges is
important for their children and youth, but still more important for
the community upon which unbridled passion, inability to work or to
spend properly, inconsequential thinking, medi       val ideals of caste,
etc., can inflict greater injuries than can typhoid fever or cholera.

The physical record of each child should be kept from date of entrance
to date of leaving school, showing condition at successive
examinations, absence because of illness, etc.

3. Thorough physical examination of children when leaving school, or
when passing compulsory school age, as a condition to "working papers"
and to "coming out."

To give working papers to children seriously handicapped by physical
defects is to buy future industrial trouble, hospital and poorhouse
bills. A boy with adenoids, a girl with eye trouble, should not be
permitted to begin the fight for self-support without at least being
clearly shown that the [286]correction of these defects will increase
their earning power. At present a schoolgirl with incipient
tuberculosis, or predisposed to that disease, can get working papers,
go to a hammock or tobacco factory, work long hours, breathe bushels
of dust, deplete her vitality, spread tuberculosis among her
co-workers and home associates, infect a tenement,       and all this
without any help or advice or any protection from society until she is
too sick to work and her physician notifies the health department that
she is a danger center. We may disagree about society's right to
control a child's act after the defects are discovered, but who will
question society's duty to tell that child and her parents the truth
about her physical needs before it accepts her labor or permits her to
"enter society"?

4. Supervision by physicians of hygiene practiced in schoolrooms and
on playgrounds.

Superintendent Maxwell, of New York City, and other educational
leaders urge teachers to do their utmost to learn the physical
conditions and home environment of the individual child, and to fit
school treatment to the individual possibilities and handicaps. But
experience proves conclusively that try as they will, teachers and
principals have neither the special knowledge nor the time to acquire
the special knowledge requisite to use the facts disclosed by the
physical examination of school children. Physicians and nurses are
needed, not so much for treating children, as for teaching children,
parents, teachers, family and dispensary physicians.

Private schools have visiting physicians who may be consulted; they
need physicians to supervise, with power to examine or to require
certificates of examination. The Committee on the Physical Welfare of
School Children found that when a visitor was detailed for that
purpose it was easy to secure the co      peration of parents, teachers,
family physicians, dispensaries, school boards, and [287]charitable
societies. The Hawthorne Club's school secretary has been similarly
successful in Boston, as have those of Hartley House, Greenwich House,
and the Public Education Association in New York.

5. Restriction of study hours at school and at home to limits
compatible with health.

Whether the hours of study at school and at home are excessive cannot
be learned from treatises on pedagogics or physiology. Because
children differ in vitality as in ability to learn, the maximum limit
for study hours should be determined by the individual child's
physical condition. When the Japanese went to war with Russia the
highest authority in the field was the army surgeon. To this fact was
largely due the astonishingly small amount of sickness and the high
fighting capacity and endurance of the Japanese, working under
unfavorable conditions. No board of school superintendents or board of
directors, no state superintendent of schools or college professor,
has the right to compel or to allow study hours beyond the maximum
compatible with the individual student's physical condition and
endurance. The physician responsible for school hygiene should have an
absolute veto upon any educational policy, method, or environment
demonstrably detrimental to children's vitality.

6. Establishment of a "follow-up" plan to insure action by parents to
correct physical defects and to attend to physical needs.

The advantages of getting things done over doing things have been
repeatedly emphasized. In smaller cities and in rural districts it is
particularly important for schools to get things done better by
existing local agencies, such as churches, health and street-cleaning
departments, hospitals, clinics, medical and sanitary societies, trade
unions, young people's societies, and women's clubs. Where parents who
have been followed up and taught, obstinately or [288]ignorantly refuse to
attend to their children's needs, the segregation of the physically
defective or needy will encourage the co      peration of children
themselves in persuading parents to act intelligently for the child's
sake. No child wants to remain "queer" or "dopey" or behind his peers.
The city superintendent of schools for New York City has asked for
laws compelling parents to permit operations and punishing them for
neglecting to take steps, within their power, to remove physical
defects discovered at school.




TEACHING A MOTHER TO CARE FOR ONE CHILD INSURES BETTER CARE FOR ALL HER CHILDREN


[289]7. Physiological age should influence school classification and
school curriculum. On this subject the studies of Dr. C. Ward
Crampton, referred to in the chapter on Vitality Tests, are invaluable
and as convincing as they are revolutionary. Scientists accept his
proof that our present high school curriculum is ill adapted to a
large proportion of children; the "physiologically too young" drop
out; only the physiologically mature succeed. The two physiological
ages should be given different work. Children whose bodies yearn for
pictures, muscular and sense expression, should be given a chance in
school for normal development. Analysis should wait for action.
Organized play and physical training antedated physical examination in
our schools. Like the curriculum they often disregard physiological
age, doing harm instead of good. Facts as to physical condition and
physiological development would enable us to utilize the momentum of
these two to broaden school hygiene and to insure proper physical
supervision. Only good would result from adopting Leipsic's plan of
having school children examined without clothing, in the presence of
parents if parents desire. Expensive? Not so expensive as high school
"mortality" due to maladjusted curriculums that force the great
majority of boys and girls to drop out before graduation and ruin the
health of a large fraction of those who remain.

8. Construction of school building and of curriculum so that, when
properly conducted, they shall neither produce nor aggravate physical
defects.

When the state for its own protection compels a child to go to school,
it pledges itself not to injure itself by injuring the child.
Thousands of children are now being subjected to conditions in school
far more injurious than the factory and shop conditions against which
the national and state child labor committees have aroused universal
indignation. Two illuminating studies of school buildings in New [290]York
City were made last year by the Committee on the Physical Welfare of
School Children, and later by the Board of Education. Similar studies
should be made of every schoolroom. Whereas our discussions of
buildings and curriculum have hitherto proceeded largely from abstract
principles of light, ventilation, heating, and pedagogics, these two
reports deal with rooms, equipment, courses of study, and school
habits as they are, with obvious detrimental effects on child victims.
Numerous questions that it is practicable to answer are given in
Chapter XIV.

What and when to build can be better determined after we have learned
the what and the where of present equipment.

In passing it is worth while to note that in large cities teachers are
frequently forced to choose between bad ventilation and street noises.
From Boston comes the suggestion that we avoid noises and evils of
congestion by building schoolhouses for city children on the outskirts
in the midst of fields, transporting, and, if necessary, feeding
children at public expense. While it is true that the public funds now
spent in attempting to cure physical and moral ills would purchase
ample country reservations, the practical next step seems to be to
provide ample play space and breathing space within the city for every
school building already erected, and without fail for all buildings to
be erected hereafter.

9. Hygiene should be so taught that children will cultivate habits of
health and see clearly the relation of health and vitality to present
happiness and future efficiency. Social rather than personal, public
rather than private, health needs emphasis. Children can be shown how
their health affects their neighbor; why money spent for health boards
is a better investment than money given to corrupt politicians; that
the cost of accepting Thanksgiving turkey or a park picnic from a
political leader who encourages inefficient government is sickness,
misery, deficient schooling, lifelong [291]handicap; that children and
adults have health rights in school and factory, on street and
playground, which the law will protect if only they know when these
rights are infringed.

10. Central supervision of school hygiene. In private and public,
boarding and day, country and city, reformatory and military,
commercial and high schools, the index       physical welfare of school
children       should be read and interpreted. Headquarters should learn
whether or not physical examinations are made and whether harmful
conditions are corrected. So far as public schools are concerned,
"headquarters" means for cities the fact center that informs city
superintendent or school board; for rural schools, it means the county
superintendent's office. Whether city or county headquarters have the
facts and act accordingly should be known by state superintendents.
Whether state superintendents are demanding the facts and educating
the county and city headquarters of their states should be known to
the national commissioner of education and by him published for all
the world. Some people think the state health board should be
responsible, others the state educational authority. The important
thing is to make some one officer responsible. Methods can be easily
worked out if the need is conceded. Legislatures will gladly confer
the powers necessary to reading the index of all public schools.

As for parochial and private schools, they may resent for a time
public supervision of their hygiene teaching and practice. However,
the case could be so presented that they would ask for it, because it
would help not only their pupils and society but the schools
themselves. No religious belief or private investment can afford to
admit that it disregards child health; state supervision would require
nothing more than evidence of adequate school hygiene.

11. Information gained at school regarding conditions prejudicial to
community health should be published and [292]made the basis of an
aggressive campaign for the enforcement of sanitary laws. Ten
thousand uses can be made of the information gained at school, ten
thousand forces can be made to do educational work, but only a few
kinds of work can be done effectively at school. Franklin Ford has
said: "You can relate school to all life, but you cannot bring all
life under the school roof." As Chapters XVI-XVIII make clear, to
socialize the point of view of dispensaries and hospitals is more
effective than to put clinics in school buildings. To do for or
give to people who can help themselves is to give up and do up
power of self-help.

Machinery that must some day exist for the execution of this programme
will be approximately the following:



I. National Machinery

1. Clearing house for facts regarding school hygiene as taught and
practiced in all schools under the Stars and Stripes; this to be a
part of the National Bureau of Education.

2. Scientific research to be conducted by the National Bureau of
Education or by the future National Board of Health.



II. State Machinery

1. Clearing house for facts regarding school hygiene taught and
practiced in all schools within state limits; this to be
maintained by the state educational authorities.

2. Agents to make special inquiries as to practice and teaching of
school hygiene.

3. Agents to inspect and to instruct county superintendents,
county physicians, teachers, normal schools, etc.

4. A bureau of experts       architect, sanitarian, teacher       whose
approval must be obtained before any school building can be
erected. (A plan which brought excellent results when applied by
state boards to charitable institutions, hospitals for the insane,
etc.)

5. Standard making by normal schools, state universities,
hospitals, or other educational and correctional institutes under
direct state management.



[293]III. County Machinery

1. Clearing house for facts regarding school hygiene taught and
practiced in all schools within county limits; this to be
maintained by the county superintendent of schools.

2. Physician and nurse to organize inspection and instruction for
rural schools, to give lessons and make demonstrations at county
institutes, to show teachers how to interest physicians, dentists,
health officers, and parents in the physical welfare of school
children.



IV. Town and Township Machinery

1. Teachers intelligent as to physical needs, as to sanitation of
buildings, etc.

2. An examining physician, to be salaried where the population
justifies; elsewhere to work as a volunteer in co      peration with
teacher and with county physician.

3. Physical history of each child from date of entrance to date of
leaving school, to be kept up to date by teacher.



V. City Machinery

1. A division to be known as the Department of School Hygiene,
headed by an officer who gives his entire time to that department.

2. A subcommittee of the Board of Education.

3. Clearing house for facts regarding school hygiene taught and
practiced in all schools within city limits.

4. Specialists to examine applicants for teaching positions, and
to re      xamine teachers to determine fitness for continuance, for
promotion, and for special assignments.

5. A bureau for inspection and control of all hygiene of school
buildings, old and new, with power to compel repairs or to reject
plans that do not make adequate sanitary provision.

6. Similar supervision of curriculum and of study hours
prescribed.

7. A bureau for the inspection and control of curriculum, required
home study, exercise, physical training, etc., so far as relates
to the health of pupils, and to the physical ability of children
to be in certain grades or to be promoted. This will decide [294]the
duration of lessons, frequency of intermissions, sequence of
subjects, time and method of recess throughout the various grades.

8. Supervision of indoor and outdoor playgrounds, roof gardens,
indoor and outdoor gymnasiums, swimming pools, etc.

9. Supervision of instruction in school hygiene.

10. A staff of inspectors for communicable diseases of pupils and
teachers, to be subject to the board of education or the board of
health.

11. A staff of examiners adequate to examine all children and
teachers at least once a year for defects of eye, ear, teeth,
nose, throat, lungs, spine, bones, glands, etc., and for weight
and height to be under the control of the board of education or
the board of health. The expense would not be as great as the
penalty paid for omitting such examination.

12. A staff of nurses to assist medical examiners to give children
practical demonstrations in cleanliness, to teach mothers the care
of children both at their homes and in mothers' meetings, to
enlist the co      peration of family physician and neighborhood
facilities, such as hospitals, dispensaries and relief agencies,
magistrates' courts and probation officers,       all to be under the
control of the board of education or the board of health.



Whether inspectors, examiners, and nurses shall be directed by the
board of education or the board of health is a question that it is
impossible to decide without knowledge of local conditions. So far as
state and county organizations are concerned, it is clear that
whatever the boards of health may do, it will be necessary for state
and county superintendents of education to equip themselves with the
machinery above recommended. In cities it is quite clear that a board
of education should be responsible for all of the machinery suggested,
excepting the three divisions that have to do with work hitherto
considered as protection against transmissible diseases, namely,
inspection, examination, district visiting. In Cleveland these are
school duties. In New York they are duties of the health department.
Boston has school nurses and health [295]department physicians. The state
law of Massachusetts provides that where health boards do not examine
school children, school boards may spend money for the purpose.

As to inspection for transmissible diseases, it seems quite clear that
health boards should not delegate their authority or responsibility to
any other body, for they alone are accountable to their communities
for protection against contagion. It is clear, too, that in the
interest of community health, departments of health are justified in
pointing out in advance of contagion those children most likely to
become a menace. Similar grounds of public interest justify the health
boards in sending nurses and physicians to the home as a means of
getting things done.

Dr. Biggs feels that responsibility for the physical welfare of school
children will strengthen health work in all cities, and, given proper
interest on the part of school officials, should make possible
universal co      peration in a constructive programme. On the other hand,
he believes that division of responsibility between school and health
boards will weaken both in their appeals for funds and for support of
a constructive programme. I have heard principals and superintendents
maintain also that the moral effect of a visit to the school by a
representative of the health board vested with powers of that board
was much greater than a visit by a representative of the school board.
They further allege that a physician coming from the outside is more
apt to see things that need correction and less apt to accept excuses
than an inspector who feels that he belongs to the same working group
as the school-teacher. Because the follow-up work in the homes
incident to successful use of knowledge gained at school involves so
many sanitary remedies, it is theoretically better organization to
hold the health authority responsible.






[296]

CHAPTER XXVIIIToC

PRESENT ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL HYGIENE IN NEW YORK CITY


Many of the elements of the machinery outlined in the preceding
chapter already exist in New York City. All of them brought together,
either by amalgamation or by proper co      rdination, would present a very
strong front. Unfortunately, however, there is not only unsatisfactory
team work, but the efficiency of individual parts is seriously
questioned by the heads of the health and school departments.

The inspection for contagious diseases, the examination for physical
defects, the follow-up work by nurses and physicians, are in charge of
the department of health. Physical training and athletics for
elementary and high schools, winter recreation centers, and vacation
playgrounds are under directors and assistants employed by the board
of education. Heretofore inadequate powers and inadequate assistance
for training or for research have been given to the physical director.

The city superintendent of schools, in his report for the year 1907,
presented to the board of education in January, 1908, declares that
the "present arrangements have been inadequate.... In only 248
schools       less than half the total number       were any examinations for
possible diseases made. In these 248 schools not more than one third
of the pupils were examined. It is only a few months since any
examinations for physical defects were made outside of the boroughs of
Manhattan and The Bronx, and then only on account of the New York
Committee on the Physical Welfare of School Children."

[297]As is so often the case, it is difficult to decide the merits of a
method that has not been efficiently executed. The department of
health has not hitherto done its best in its school relations. The
commissioner of health, in a public interview, expresses resentment at
the strictures by the school authorities. Yet in 1907 he permitted to
accumulate an unexpended balance of $33,000 specifically voted for
school inspectors, and repeatedly tried to have this amount
transferred to other purposes. The interest of the Bureau of Municipal
Research in municipal budgets that tell for what purposes money is
voted and then prevent transfers without full publicity, preserved
this particular fund. Moreover, the discussion that prevented its
diversion from physical examinations strengthened the health
department's interest in this important responsibility. Neither
physicians nor nurses have been adequately supervised. Instead of
seeing that defects were removed, the department of health sent out
postal cards like the following:






From 118,000 such notices sent out only 9600 replies were received, of
which only one in twenty stated that attention had actually been given
the needy child. The [298]department had been satisfied with evidence that
family physicians had advised parents properly, as in the case of the
child above reported:






For a candid, complete criticism of the medical examination work up to
June, 1908, consult the report of the Bureau of Municipal Research,
presented to the Washington Congress of Public Education Associations
in October, 1908, by Commissioner of Health, Dr. Darlington. The
bureau's study is entitled A Bureau of Child Hygiene, and, in
addition to the story of medical examination in New York City schools,
gives the blank forms adopted for use in September, 1908. Important as
are the facts given in this study, its greatest value, its authors
declare, is in its account of "the method of intelligent
self-criticism and experiment which alone enables a public department
to keep its service abreast of public needs."

The Bureau of Municipal Research made its study for the purpose of
learning whether the disappointing results emphasized by the school
authorities were due to "dual responsibility in the school       that of
the board of education and that of the department of health"       and to
"lack of power or inclination to compel parents to remedy defects,"
[299]or to deficient administration of power and inclination by health
officials. Co      perating with school physicians and nurses in three
schools, 1442 children were examined, of whom 1345, or 93.2 per cent,
had 3458 defects that needed treatment. The postal-card notice was
followed by an interview with the parent either at school or at home.
Only 4.2 per cent of the total number of parents refused to act, 81
per cent secured or permitted treatment for one or more defects, while
15 per cent promised to take the proper steps at the earliest possible
date. Three fourths of the parents acted after one personal interview.
"The net average result of a day's work by a nurse was the actual
treatment of over five children, three of them completely, and two of
them for one or more defects,"       sixty cents per child!




A PHOTOGRAPH OF MOUTH BREATHING MAY MAKE COMPULSION UNNECESSARY


Having established the willingness       even eagerness       of parents to do
all in their power to remove defects that handicapped their children,
it was obviously the duty of the health department so to organize its
work that it could insure the education of parents. The new Bureau of
Child Hygiene gives foremost place to instruction of parents in care
of babies, in needs of school children, and in the importance of
physical examination when enlisting in the industrial army. Whether
this work is well done is learned by result tests applied at
headquarters, where work done [300]and results are reported daily and
summarized weekly. No longer will it be possible, without detection,
for one physician to find only eye trouble and to neglect all other
defects; for two inspectors examining different children in the same
school to report results differing by 100 per cent; for physicians in
different schools to find one 18 per cent, another 100 per cent with
defects; for two inspectors examining identical children to agree on
51 out of 101 cases of vision, on 49 out of 96 cases of adenoids, or 3
out of 10 cases of skin disease.

So conclusive were the results of follow-up work efficiently
supervised by the department of health, that school officials are, for
the present, inclined to waive the demand for the transfer of
physicians and nurses to the board of education, and to substitute
education for compulsion with parents who obstinately refuse to take
proper remedial measures for their children when reported defective.

This present plan requires the entire working time of inspectors and
nurses for school work. Thus New York has for the present definitely
abandoned the plan of having the district inspection for contagious
diseases done by school physicians. The purpose of the change is not
to reduce danger of infection, which was negligible, but to increase
the probability of scientific attention to school children.

Before a final settlement is made for New York City there should be
tests showing what the school authorities would do if physicians and
nurses were subordinate to them. It is conceivable that one physician
working from nine to five would accomplish more than six physicians
working the alleged three hours a day. So imperative are the demands
of school hygiene that it seems probable that in New York and in other
large cities school physicians, whether paid by the board of health or
the board of education, must be expected to be at the service of
school children, subject to the call of school officers, during as
many [301]hours of the day as teachers themselves must give. It is even
conceivable that effective use of the knowledge gained by physical
examinations of school children, and by those responsible for school
hygiene, will require evening office hours or evening visits to homes,
and regular Saturday office hours and Saturday visits by school
physicians and nurses. Finally, it must be expected that the programme
for school hygiene will need the special attention of physicians and
nurses during the summer months, and other vacation periods when
children and parents alike have time to receive and to carry out their
instructions.

One danger in New York City is that the board of education, like the
board of health, when compelled to choose between so-called standard,
necessary, traditional duty and school hygiene, will sacrifice the
latter. The school authorities, without any more funds and without
physicians and nurses, could already have made, had they desired, eye
tests and breathing tests sufficiently accurate to detect the majority
of children needing attention. The outcome of the discussion as to the
jurisdiction of the two boards will undoubtedly be to interest both in
their joint responsibility for children's welfare, and to increase the
attention given by both to the physical condition of the child when he
presents himself for registration as a wage earner.






[302]

CHAPTER XXIXToC

OFFICIAL MACHINERY FOR ENFORCING HEALTH RIGHTS


The argument for getting things done presumes adequate active
machinery, official and private, for doing things that schools are
being urged to do. The chapter on Departments of School Hygiene
suggests local, county, state, and national machinery necessary (1) to
protect the child from injuries due to school environment, school
methods, and school curriculum; (2) to getting those things done for
the child at home and on the street, need for which is disclosed by
physical and vitality tests at school. It is unreasonable to confine
the school to the activities above outlined unless health machinery,
adequate to the demands placed upon it by school and other community
needs, is devised and kept in order.

Generally speaking, adequate health machinery is already provided for
by city charters and by the state laws under which villages,
townships, and counties are organized. Quite as generally, however,
machinery and methods of adequate administration are undeveloped. How
much machinery has already been set to work by New York City is shown
by the accompanying chart. A useful exercise for individuals or school
classes wishing to study health administration would be to chart in
this way the machinery actually at work in their locality, county, and
state. Even for New York it should be remembered that this chart does
not include national quarantine, the state protection of the port, the
state dairy and health commissions, or the state and national food
inspection. [303]To get an idea of the vast amount of attention given
to health in New York City there should be added to this chart the
work of many departments other than the department of health. The
building bureau, tenement-house department, board of water supply,
sewage commission, street cleaning, public baths and comfort stations,
the department of water, gas, and electricity, and finally the
department of hygiene and physical training in the public schools.

Five elements of adequate machinery are generally lost sight of:

1. The voter.

2. The nonvoter, subject to health laws and often apt to violate
them.

3. The mayor, governor, or president who appoints health officers.

4. The council, board of aldermen, legislature, or congress that
enacts health laws.

5. The police courts and the judiciary       police, circuit and
supreme       that decide whether society has suffered from violation
of law and what penalties should be inflicted for such violation.

Legislative bodies have hitherto slighted their responsibilities
toward public health. The chairman of a committee on public health of
a state legislature was heard to remark, "I asked for that committee
because there isn't a blooming thing to do." If voters, nonvoters, and
health officials will follow the suggestion of this book to secure
school and health reports that will disclose community and health
needs, it will be increasingly difficult for legislators to refuse
funds necessary to efficient health administration.

To the courts tradition has required such deference that one hesitates
to find out in how far they have been responsible in the past for the
nonenforcement of health laws. Yet nothing is more obstructive of
sanitary progress than the failure of magistrates to enforce adequate
[304]penalties for truancy, adulteration of milk, maintaining a public
nuisance, defiling the air with black smoke, offering putrid meats for
sale, running an unclean lodging house, defying tenement-house or
factory regulations, working children under age and overtime, spitting
in public places, or failing to register transmissible diseases.[16]

The appointing officer cannot, of course, be held responsible unless
voters and nonvoters know in how far his appointees are inefficient,
and in how far he himself has failed to do his utmost to secure funds
necessary to efficiency. Too frequently appointments to health
positions have been made on political grounds, and catastrophes have
been met by blundering incapacity. The political appointee has been
made the scapegoat, and the appointing officer, whether mayor,
governor, or president, has regained public confidence by replacing an
old with a new incompetent.

In order to have health machinery work properly, the appointing
officer should not be allowed to shift responsibility for failure to
his subordinates. For example, it was recently found in New York City
that while the tenement-house commissioner was being condemned for
failing to enforce the law, he had turned over to the corporation
counsel, also appointed by the mayor, for prosecution ten thousand
"violations" to which no attention whatever had been paid!

The voter, nonvoter, appointing officer, legislative officer, and
judicial officer determine the character and purpose of machinery and
are analogous to the surveyors, stock-holders, directors, and
constructors who provide railroads with tracks and with running stock.
The actual running force of health department or railroad is what is
meant by its official machinery. What this machinery should be
depends, of course, upon the amount of business to be [305]done, and
differs with the size of the district and the character of population
to be served.




FOR PUSH-CART FOOD, INSPECTION IS PARTICULARLY NEEDFUL


Local health machinery should guarantee protection against the evils
mentioned in preceding chapters. In general, one man is better than
three to execute, although three may be better than one to legislate.
Where small communities do not wish to have the entire state sanitary
code rigidly administered, they can adopt New York's method of a
legislative board of three members, headed by an executive, whose
business it is to act, not talk; to watch subordinates, and to enforce
rigidly and continuously ordinances passed by the board. The National
Bureau of Census places under the general heading Health and
Sanitation the following activities: health administration, street
cleaning and refuse disposal, sewers and sewage disposal. Sanitarians
generally emphasize also the health significance of efficient water
service.

[306]A community's health programme should be clearly outlined in the
annual budget. Where health work is given funds without specification
of the kinds of work to be done, serious evils may be overlooked and
lesser evils permitted to monopolize the energies of health officers.
Again, after money has been voted to prevent an evil, records should
be made of work done when done, and of money spent when spent, so that
any diversion will be promptly made known. The best present guides to
budget making, to educational health reports, and to records that show
efficiency or inefficiency of health administrators are the budget and
report of the department of health for New York City, and the story of
their evolution told in Making a Municipal Budget, by the Bureau of
Municipal Research.

To find out whether local machinery is adequate, the reader must
enumerate the things that need to be done in his community,
remembering that in all parts of the United States to-day there are
sanitary laws offering protection against dangers to health, excepting
some dangers not understood until recently, such as child labor,
dangerous trades, lack of safety devices. Adequate local protection,
however, will not become permanent until adequate state machinery is
secured.

State health machinery should be of two kinds,       fact-gathering and
executive supervision through inspection. The greatest service of
state boards of health is to educate localities as to their own needs,
using the experience of all communities to teach each community in how
far its health administration menaces itself and its neighbors. In
addition to registration of contagious diseases, facts as to deaths
and births should be registered. State health boards should "score"
communities as dairies and milk shops are now being scored by the
National Bureau of Animal Industries and several boards of health.
When communities persist in maintaining a public nuisance and [307]in
failing to enforce health laws, state health machinery should be made
to accomplish by force what it has failed to accomplish by education.




NATIONAL MACHINERY HAS STIMULATED LOCAL MILK INSPECTION AND STATE DAIRY INSPECTION


States alone can cope adequately with dangers to milk and water
sources and to food. The economic motive of farmers has developed
strong veterinary boards for the protection of cattle. Similar
executive precaution must soon be taken by cities for the protection
of babies and adults of the human species. It is far more economical
to insure clean dairies, clean water sources, and wholesome
manufactured foods by state inspectors than by local inspectors. At
present the task of obtaining clean milk and clean water falls upon
the few cities enlightened enough and rich enough to finance the
inspection of community foods. Once tested, it would be very easy to
prove that [308]properly supported state health authorities will save many
times the cost of their health work in addition to thousands of lives.

County or district machinery is little known in America. For that
reason rural sanitary administration is neglected and rural hospitals
are lacking. In the British Isles rural districts are given almost as
careful inspection as are cities. Houses may not be built below a
certain standard of lighting, ventilation, and conveniences.
Outbuildings must be a safe distance from wells. Dairies must be kept
clean. Patients suffering from transmissible diseases may be removed
by force to hospitals. What is more to the point, rural hospitals have
proved that patients cared for by them are far more apt to recover
than patients cared for much more expensively and less satisfactorily
at home, while less likely to pollute water and milk sources or
otherwise to endanger health.

With national machinery the chapter on Vital Statistics has already
dealt. We shall undoubtedly soon have a national board of health. Like
the state boards, its first function should be educative. In addition,
however, there are certain administrative functions where inefficiency
may result in serious losses to nation, state, and locality. National
quarantine, national inspection of meats, foods, and drugs are
administrative functions of vital consequence to every citizen.
Authorities are acquainted at the present time with the fact that the
sanitary administration of the army and navy is unnecessarily and
without excuse wasteful of human energy and human life. In the Spanish
American War 14 soldiers died of disease for 1 killed in battle; in
the Civil War 2 died of disease to 1 killed in battle; during the wars
of the last 200 years 4 have died of disease for 1 killed in battle.
Yet Japan in her war with Russia, by using means known to the United
States Army in 1860, gave health precedence over [309]everything else and
lost but 1 man to disease for 4 killed in battle. Diseases are still
permitted to make havoc with American commerce because the national
government does not apply to its own limits the standards which it has
successfully applied to Cuba and Panama.

"The Japanese invented nothing and had no peculiar knowledge or skill;
they merely took occidental science and used it. The remarkable thing
is not what they did, but that they were allowed to do it. It is a
terrible thing that Congress should choose to make one of its rare
displays of economy in a matter where a few thousand dollars saved
means, in case our army should have anything to do, not only the
utterly needless and useless loss of thousands of lives, but an
enormous decrease of military efficiency, and might, conceivably, make
all the difference between victory and defeat."

CHAPTER XXXToC

SCHOOL AND HEALTH REPORTS


For every school-teacher or school physician responsible for the
welfare of children at school, there are fifty or more parents
responsible for the physical welfare of children at home. Therefore it
is all important for parents to know how to read the index for their
own children, for their children's associates, and for their
community. School reports and health reports should tell clearly and
completely the story of the school child's physical needs.




NECESSARY TO EFFICIENT DEMOCRACY


It is impracticable at the present time to expect a large number of
men and women to be interested in the reports published by school and
health boards, for, with few exceptions, little effort is made to
write these reports so that they will interest the parent.
Fortunately, a small number of persons wishing to be intelligent can
compel public officials to ascertain the necessary facts and to give
them to the public. So backward is the reporting of public business
[311]that at the present time there is probably no service that a citizen
can render his community which would prove of greater importance than
to secure proper publicity from health and school boards.

Generally speaking, these published reports fail to interest the
citizen, not because officials wish to conceal, but because officials
do not believe that the public is interested. A mayor of Philadelphia
once furnished a notable exception. He called at the department of
health and complained against publishing the number of cases of
typhoid and smallpox lest stories in the newspapers "frighten the city
and injure business." A sanitary inspector who was in the room asked
if Philadelphia's business was more important than the health of
Philadelphia's citizens. As a result of her "impertinence" the
inspector was removed. That same year an epidemic of smallpox spread
through all the rural districts and cities of Pennsylvania, because
physicians thought it would be kinder to the patients not to make
known to their neighbors the presence of so disagreeable a disease.
Almost all health and school authorities, however, can be made to see
the advantage of taking the public into their confidence, because
public confidence means both public recognition and greater success in
obtaining funds. With more funds comes the power to do more work.

Other details with regard to health reports will be found in the
chapter on Vital Statistics. As to school reports, little thought has
been given in the past to their educational possibilities. A book was
recently published       School Reports and School Efficiency       by the
Committee on the Physical Welfare of School Children, which tells the
origins of school reports; contains samples of reports from one
hundred cities; gives lists of questions frequently answered,
occasionally answered, and never answered; and shows how to study a
particular report so as to learn whether or not important questions
are answered. The United States commissioner [312]of education has
organized among state and city superintendents special committees on
uniform and adequate reporting. His aggressive leadership is welcomed
by school men generally, and promises vast benefits.

Just because the physical welfare of the school child is an index to
health needs, the school report can put into one statement for a city
or a state the story told by the index. The accompanying card tells
facts that the individual teacher and individual parent want to know
about a child, what a superintendent wants to know about all children,
and what a community wants to know about all children. A modification
of this card will soon be adopted in New York City. It is both a card
index and a card biography of the individual boy or girl. It is
expected to follow the child from class to class, each teacher telling
the story of his physical welfare and his progress. When the boy goes
to a new school or new grade, his new teacher can see at a glance not
only what subjects have given him trouble, but what diseases or
physical defects have kept him out of school or otherwise retarded his
progress. With this card it is easy to take a hundred children of the
same age and the same grade, to put down in one column those who have
eye defects, and in another those who have no eye defects, for every
school, every district, and for the schools as a whole. Schools that
use these record cards are enabled, by thus classifying the total, to
learn where the defects of children are, how serious the problem is,
how many days children lose from school because of preventable
defects, and in what section of the city the defects are most
prevalent.

The mere reporting of facts will stimulate teachers, principals, and
parents to give attention. For example, assume a table:

Field of Inspection



  
  Total number of public schools
  7
  
  
  Public schools under inspection
  3
  
  
  Public schools not under inspection
  4
  



The reader wonders why four schools are neglected and which particular
schools they are. Let the next table read:

Examination



  
  Total registration in all schools
  1500
  
  
  Number of children examined
  500
  
  
  Number of children not examined
  1000
  



Parents begin to wonder whether or not their children were examined,
and why the taxes spent for school examination of all children go to
one third of the children. The next table arrests attention:

Treatment



  
  Number needing treatment
  200
  
  
  Number known to have been treated
  50
  
  
  Number not known to have been treated
  150
  



We ask, at once, if examination is worth while, and if treatment
really corrects the defects, saves the pupil's time and teacher's
time, discovers many defects; and we want to find out whether the one
hundred and fifty reported not treated have since been attended to.

[313]




[314]




[315]Again, if three out of five of those examined need treatment, people
will wonder whether among the thousand not examined there is the same
proportion       three out of five, or six hundred       who have some trouble
that needs attention. Having begun to wonder, they will ask questions,
and will expect the board of health or the school physicians to see
that the questions are answered. As has been proved in New York,
taxpayers and the press will go farther and will demand that the
annual budget provide for making general next year the benefits found
to result last year from a test of health policies.

The story of the prevalence of contagious diseases in school children
could be told by a table such as is now in use by New York's
department of health:

The effect of a report telling what schools have enough seats, proper
ventilation, adequate medical inspection, safe drinking water, ample
play space, and what schools are without these necessities is to cause
the reader to rank the [318]particular school that he happens to know;
i.e. he says, "School A is better equipped than School B; or, School C
is neglected." County and state superintendents in many states have
acquired the habit of ranking schools according to the number of
children who pass in arithmetic, algebra, etc. It would greatly
further the cause of public health and, at the same time, advance the
interest of education if state superintendents would rank individual
schools, and if county superintendents would rank individual schools,
according to the number of children found to have physical defects,
the number afflicted with contagious diseases, and the number properly
treated.

It is difficult to compare one school with another, because it is
necessary to make subtractions and divisions and to reduce to
percentages. It would not be so serious for a school of a thousand
pupils as for a school of two hundred, to report 100 for adenoids. To
make it possible to compare school with school without judging either
unfairly, the state superintendent of schools for Connecticut has made
tables in which cities are ranked according to the number of pupils,
average attendance, per capita cost, etc. As to each of these
headings, cities are grouped in a manner corresponding to the line up
of a battalion, "according to height." A general table is then shown,
which gives the ranking of each city with respect to each important
item. Applied to schools, this would work out as follows:

[319]Such a table fails to convey its significance unless the reader is
reminded that rank 18 in children not treated is as good a record for
a school that ranks 30 in register as is rank 6 for a school that
ranks 10 in register.

The Connecticut report makes a serious mistake in failing to arrange
schools according to population. If this were done, schools of a size
would be side by side and comparison would be fair. When, as in the
above table, schools are arranged alphabetically, a school with four
thousand pupils may follow or precede a school with four hundred
pupils, and comparison will be unfair and futile.

Where, on the other hand, schools are arranged in order of register, a
table will show whether schools confronted with practically the same
problems, the same number of defects, the same number of children
needing treatment, are equally successful, or perhaps equally
inactive, in correcting these defects. The following table brings out
clearly marked unequal achievement in the face of relatively equal
need.

If the number of schools in a state is so large that it is unlikely
that people will read the table of ranking because of the difficulty
of finding their own school, an alphabetical table might be given that
would show where to look in the general ranking table for the school
or schools in which the reader is interested.

[320]Experience will demonstrate to public school superintendents the
strategic advantage of putting together all the things they need and
of telling the community over and over again just what needs there
are, what penalties are paid for want of them, and what benefits would
result from obtaining them. If health needs of school children were
placed side by side with mental results, the relation would come out
so clearly that parents, school boards, and taxpayers would realize
how inextricably they are bound together and would see that health
needs are satisfied. To this end superintendents should require
teachers to keep daily reports of school conditions.

The teacher's daily report of the temperature of a schoolroom, taken
three times a day, tells the parent exactly what is the efficiency of
the ventilating and heating apparatus in the particular school in
which he is interested; whereas the report of the department of
buildings gives only the number of schools which have an approved
system of ventilation and steam heat. School authorities may or may
not know that this system of ventilation is out of order, that the
thermometer in the indoor playground of School A stood at forty
degrees for many days in winter. But they must know it when the
principal of School A sends in a daily record; the school board, the
parents, or the press [321]will then see that the condition is remedied.
If the condition is due to lack of funds, funds will never be
forthcoming so long as the condition is concealed.

Similar results will follow publicity of overcrowding, too little play
space, dry cleaning of school buildings, etc. The intent of such
reporting is not to "keep tabs" on the school-teacher, the school
child, the janitor, the principal, superintendent, or board, but to
insure favorable conditions and to correct bad conditions. This is
done best by giving everybody the facts. The objective test of the
efficiency of a method throws emphasis on the method, not on the
motive of those operating it. The blackboard method of publishing
facts concentrates attention upon the importance of those facts and
enlists aid in the attainment of the end sought.






[322]

CHAPTER XXXIToC

THE PRESS


The president of Princeton University declares that for several
decades we have given education that does not instruct and instruction
that does not educate. Others tell us that because we read daily
papers and magazines our minds become superficial, that our power to
concentrate or memorize is weakened,       that we read so much of
everything that we learn little of anything. As the habit of reading
magazines and newspapers is constantly increasing, I think we must
assume that it has come to stay. If we cannot check it, we can at
least turn it to good advantage, systematize it, and discipline
ourselves.

Among the subjects continually described in newspapers and magazines,
and even on billboards and in street-car advertising, is the subject
of hygiene. No greater service can be rendered the community than for
those who are conducting discussions of health to teach people how to
read correctly this mass of information regarding health, to separate
misinformation from information, and to apply the lessons learned to
personal and public hygiene. There is no better way of doing this than
to teach a class or a child to clip out of magazines and newspapers
all important references to health, and then to classify these under
the subject-matter treated. A teacher, parent, or club leader might
practice by using the classification of subjects outlined in the
Contents of this book. It is surprising how rapidly one builds up a
valuable collection serviceable for talks or papers, but more
particularly for giving one a vital and intelligent interest in
practical health topics.

[323]Interested in comparing the emphasis placed on health topics in a
three-cent paper having a small circulation with a penny paper having
twenty times the circulation, I made during one week thirty-eight
clippings from the three-cent paper and ninety-five from the penny
paper. The high-priced paper had no editorial comment within the field
of health, whereas the penny paper had three columns, in which were
discussed among other things: The Economics of Bad Teeth; Need for
Individual Efficiency; "Good Fellows" Lower Standard of Living by
Neglecting their Families. The penny paper advertised fifty-two
foods, garments, whiskies, patent medicines, or beautifiers urged upon
health grounds. In the three-cent paper twenty-six out of thirty-eight
items advertised food, clothing, patent medicine, or whisky. One issue
of a monthly magazine devoted to woman's interests contained
twenty-eight articles and editorials and fifty-five advertisements
that concern health,       thirty-seven per cent of total reading matter
and thirty-seven per cent of total advertisement.

Excellent discipline is afforded by this clipping work. It is
astonishing how few men and women, even from our better colleges, know
how to organize notes, clippings, or other data, so that they can be
used a few weeks later. There is a satisfaction in seeing one's material
grow, as is remembered by all of us, in making picture scrapbooks or
collections of picture postal cards and stamps. "Collections" have
generally failed for want of classification,       putting things of a kind
together. Chronological arrangement is uninteresting because
unprofitable. One never knows where to find a picture, or a stamp, or a
health clipping. Clippings, like libraries, will be little used if not
properly catalogued so that use is easy. If a health-clipping collection
is attempted, there are four essentials: (1) arrangement by topic; (2)
inclusion of advertisements; (3) inclusion of items from magazines; (4)
cross references.

[324]For classification, envelopes can be used or manila cards 10       12
inches. The teacher, parent, or advanced student will probably think
the envelope most useful because most easily carried and filed,       most
likely to be used. But clippings should be bound together in orderly
appearance, or else it will be disagreeable working with them.
Children, however, will like the pasting on sheets, which show clearly
the growth of each topic. Envelopes or cards should not have clippings
that deal with only one health topic. Unless a test is made to see how
many health references there are in a given period, it should be made
a rule not to clip any item that does not contain something new,       some
addition to the knowledge already collected.

Advertisements will prove interesting and educative. When newspapers
and magazines announce some new truth, the commercial motive of
manufacturer or dealer sees profit in telling over and over again how
certain goods will meet the new need. Children will soon notice that
the worst advertisements appear in the papers that talk most of
"popular rights," "justice," and "morality." They will be shocked to
see that the popular papers accept money to tell falsehoods about fake
cures. They will be pleased that the best monthly magazines contain no
such advertisements. They will challenge paper or magazine, and thus
will be enlisted while young in the fight against health
advertisements that injure health.

To clip articles from magazines will seem almost irreverent at first.
But the reverence for magazines and books is less valuable to
education than the knowledge concealed in them. Except where families
preserve all magazines, clippings will add greatly to their
serviceability.

The art of cross-referencing is invaluable to the organized mind. The
purpose of classifying one's information is not to show how much there
is, but to answer questions quickly and to guide constructive
thinking. A clipping that deals [325]with alcoholism, patent medicine,
and tuberculosis must be posted in three places, or
cross-referenced; otherwise it will be used to answer but one question
when it might answer three. If magazines may not be cut, it will be
easy to record the fact of a useful article by writing the title,
page, and date on the appropriate index card, or inclosing a slip so
marked in the proper envelope.

While it is true that the most important bibliography one can have in
his private library is a classification of the material of which he
himself has become a part while reading it, there are a number of
health journals that one can profitably subscribe for. In fact, it is
often true that the significant discoveries in scientific fields, or
the latest public improvements, such as parks, bridges, model
tenements, will not be appreciated until one has read in health
journals how these improvements affect the sickness rate and the
enjoyment rate of those least able to control their living conditions.
The physician and nurse in their educational work for hospitals are
distributors of health propaganda.

Wherever there is a local journal devoted to health, parents,
teachers, educators, and club leaders would do well to subscribe and
to hold this journal up to a high standard by quoting, thanking,
criticising it. In New Jersey, for example, is a monthly called the
New Jersey Review of Charities and Corrections that deals with every
manner of subject having to do with public health as well as with
private and public morality and education.

A similar journal, intended for national instruction, is The Survey,
whose topical index for last year enumerates two hundred and
thirty-two articles dealing with subjects directly connected with
public hygiene, e.g.:

Schools, 6; school inspection, 3; eyes,       school children, 1; sex
instruction in the schools, 2; psychiatric clinic, special
children, 2; industrial education, 5; child labor, 18;
playgrounds, 26; alley, crap, playing in streets, 3; labor
conditions, 18; [326]industrial accidents, 10; wage-earner's
insurance, 4; factory inspection, 1; consumer's league, 3; women's
work, 6; tuberculosis, 23; hospitals, dispensaries (social), 5;
tenement reform, 10; living conditions, 2; baths, 1; public
comfort stations, 2; lodging houses, 1; clean streets, 6; clean
milk, 6; smoke, 1; noises, 1; parks, 1; patent medicines, 2;
sanitary code, 1; mortality statistics, 2; social settlements and
public health, 1; midwives, 1; children's bureau, 1; juvenile and
adult delinquent, 25; dependent, defective, and insane, 7; blind,
5; cripples, 1; homes for aged, 1; inebriates, 3; Traveler's Aid
Committee, 1; infant mortality, 2; social diseases, 2.



The National Hospital Record, the Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette,
the Journal of Nursing, are three other magazines primarily intended
for nurses and physicians, but full of suggestive material for
unprofessional readers. National magazines concerned with health, but
seeking popular circulation, are Good Health and Physical Culture.
In England there is a special magazine called Children's Diseases,
which could be of great help to a school library for special
reference. The same can be said of the Psychological Clinic,
Pediatrics, and other technical journals published in this country.
For many persons, to make the best use of any one copy of these
magazines, clipping is of course impossible, but noting on a card or
envelope is practicable.

Of late many of the national popular magazines have several columns
devoted to health. We have not appreciated the educational
possibilities of these columns. In most large cities there are monthly
book reviews which may be profitably consulted in learning the new
thought in the health field. If teachers would either write their
experience or ask questions, if children knew that in a certain
magazine or newspaper questions as to ventilation, bathing, exercise,
would be answered, they would take a keen interest in the progress of
discussions. The large daily papers make a great feature of their
health hints. It is not [327]their fault if questioners care more about
cosmetics and hair bleaches than about the fresh-air cure of
headaches. They will co      perate with teachers and parents in securing
more general discussion of other problems than beauty doctoring.

Finally, persons wanting not only to have intelligence as to matters
promoting health, but actually to exert a helpful influence in their
community, ought to want the published reports of the mayor, health
department, the public schools, and other institutions, noting
carefully all that is said about conditions relating to health and
about efforts made to correct all unfavorable conditions. The best
literature of our day, with regard to social needs, appears in the
reports of our public and private institutions and societies. Of
increasing value are the publications of the national government
printing office. Because it is no one's business to find out what
valuable material is contained in such reports, and because no
educational museum is comparing report with report, those who live
nearest to our health problems and who see most clearly the health
remedies, are not stimulated to give to the public their special
knowledge in an interesting, convincing way.

Teaching children how to find health lessons in public documents will
advance the cause of public ethics as well as of public health. At the
New York State Conference of Charities, of 1907, one official
complained that the physicians made no educational use of their
valuable experience for public education. He stated that a study of
medical journals and health articles in popular magazines revealed the
fact that the number of papers prepared by physicians in state
hospitals averaged one to a doctor for every five or six years of
service. This state of affairs is even more exaggerated in strictly
educational institutions. Columbia University has recently instituted
a series of lectures to be given by its professors to its professors,
so that they may have a general knowledge of the work being done in
other [328]fields besides their own at their own university. This is
equally important for teachers and heads of departments in elementary
schools. It is now admitted by most educators that elementary schools
and young children present more pedagogical difficulties and pressing
biological problems than higher schools. If teachers and parents would
realize that their method of solving the health problems that arise
daily in the schoolroom and in the home would interest other mothers
and teachers, their spirit of co      peration would soon be reflected in
school journals, popular magazines, and daily newspapers.

PART V. ALLIANCE OF HYGIENE, PATRIOTISM, AND RELIGION



CHAPTER XXXIIToC

DO-NOTHING AILMENTS


"Men have died, from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not
for love"       nor for work. Work of itself never killed anybody nor
made anybody sick. Work has caused worry, mental strain, and physical
breakdown, only when men while working have been deprived of air, sun,
light, exercise, sleep, proper food at the proper time, opportunity to
live and work hygienically. Fortunately for human progress, doing
nothing brings ailments of its own and has none of the compensations
of work. As the stomach deprived of substantial food craves unnatural
food,       sweets, stimulants,       so the mind deprived of substantial,
regular diet of wholesome work turns to unwholesome, petty, fantastic,
suspicious, unhappy thoughts. This state of mind, combined with the
lack of bodily exercise that generally accompanies it, reacts
unfavorably on physical health. An editor has aptly termed the
do-nothing condition as a self-inflicted confinement:

A great deal of the misery and wretchedness among young men that
inherit great fortunes is caused by the fact that they are
practically in jail. They have nothing to do but eat, drink, and
enjoy themselves, and they cannot understand why their lives are
dull.

We have had the owner of a great railroad system pathetically
telling the public that he is unhappy. That is undoubtedly true,
[330]because with all his race horses, and his yachts, and all the
things that he imagines to be pleasures, he is not really doing
anything.

If he were running one little railroad station up the road,
handling the freight, fussing about dispatches, living above the
railroad station in two rooms, and buying shoes in a neighboring
village for fifteen children he would be busy and happy.

But he cannot be happy because he is in prison,       in a prison of
money, a prison that is honorable because it gives him everything
that he wants, and he wants nothing.

A New York newspaper that circulates among the working classes where
young men and women are inclined to associate health and happiness
with doing nothing recently gave two columns to "Dandy Jim," the
richest dog in the world. Dandy Jim's mistress left him a
ten-thousand-dollar legacy. During his lifetime he wore diamonds.
Every day he ate candy that cost eighty cents a pound. The coachman
took him driving in the park sunny afternoons. He had no cares and
nothing to work for. His food came without effort. He had fatty
degeneration of the vital organs. He was pampered, coddled, and killed
thereby. Thousands of men and women drag out lives of unhappiness for
themselves and others because, like Dandy Jim, they have nothing to
work for, are pampered, coddled victims of fatty degeneration. When
President Butler of Columbia University finds it necessary to censure
"the folly and indifference of the fathers, vanity and thoughtless
pride of the mothers" who encourage do-nothing ailments; and when the
editor of the Psychological Clinic protests that the fashionable
private schools and the private tutor share with rich fathers and
mothers responsibility for life failures,       it is time that educators
teach children themselves the physical and moral ailments and
disillusions that come from doing nothing.

Ten years ago a stenographer inherited two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars. Her dream of nothing to do [331]was realized. She gave up her
strenuous business life. Possessions formerly coveted soon clogged her
powers of enjoyment. She imagined herself suffering from various
diseases, shut herself up in her house, and refused to see any one.
She grew morbid and was sure that every person who approached her had
some sneaking, personal, hostile motive. Though always busy, she
accomplished little. Desultory work, procrastination, and
self-indulgence destroyed her power of concentration. She could not
think long enough on one subject to think it out straight, therefore
she was constantly deceived in her friends and interests. She first
trusted everybody, then mistrusted everybody. Infatuation with every
new acquaintance was quickly followed by suspicion. For years she was
a very sick woman, a victim of do-nothing ailments.

Doing nothing has of late been seriously recommended to American
business men. They are advised to retire from active work as soon as
their savings produce reasonable income. It is true, this suggestion
has been made as an antidote to greed rather than for the happiness of
the business man. What retiring from business is apt to mean, is
indicated by a gentleman who at the age of sixty decided to sell his
seat on the New York Stock Exchange and to enjoy life. He became
restless and very miserable. He threw himself violently into one thing
after another; in less than a year he became an ill, broken old man,
after trying vainly to buy back his business.

Both mind and body were made to work. The function of the brain is to
think to a purpose, just as the function of the heart is to pump
blood. The habit of doing nothing is very easily formed. The
"out-of-work" soon become "the work-shy." Having too little to do is
worse for the body and mind than having too little to eat. Social
reformers emphasize the bad effect on society of vagrancy. Evils of
indiscriminate relief to the poor are vividly described year [332]after
year. The philanthropist is condemned, who, by his gifts, encourages
an employee's family to spend what they do not earn, and to shun work.
Yet the idleness of the tramp, street loafer, and professional
mendicant is a negligible evil compared with the hindrance to human
progress caused by the idleness of the well-to-do, the rich, the
educated, the refined, the "best" people. It is as much a wrong to
bring up children in an atmosphere of do-nothingism, as to refuse to
have their teeth attended to or to have glasses fitted to weak eyes.

From the point of view of community welfare it is far more serious for
the rich child to be brought up in idleness or without a purpose than
for the poor child to become a public charge. Not only has society a
right to expect more from rich children in return for the greater
benefits they enjoy, but so long as rich children control the
expenditure of money, they control also the health and happiness of
other human beings. Unless taught the value and joy of wholesome work
they cannot themselves think straight, nor are they likely to want to
understand how they can use their wealth for the benefit of mankind.
To quote President Butler again:

The rich boy who receives a good education and is trained to be a
self-respecting member of the body politic might in time share on
equal terms the chance of the poor boy to become a man of genuine
influence and importance on his own account, just as now by the
neglect, or worse, of his parents the very rich boy is apt to be
relegated to the limbo of curiosities, and too often of decadence.

Nervous invalids make life miserable for themselves and for others,
when often their sole malady is lack of the right kind of work to do.

Suiting work to interest and interest to work is an economy that
should not be overlooked. The energy [333]spent in forcing oneself to do a
distasteful task can be turned to productive channels when work is
made pleasurable. The fact is frequently deplored that whereas
formerly a man became a full-fledged craftsman, able to perform any
branch of his trade, he is now confined to doing special acts because
neither his interest nor his mind is called into play. Work seems to
react unfavorably on his health. He has not the pride of the artisan
in the finished product, for he seldom sees it. He does a task. His
employer is a taskmaster. He decides that work is not good for him as
easily as when a school-boy he grasped the meaning of escape from his
lessons. By failing to fit studies to a student's interest, or by
failing to insure a student's interest in his studies, schools and
colleges miseducate young men and young women to look upon all work as
tasks, as discipline, necessary but irksome, and to be avoided if
possible. Just as there is a way of turning all the energy of the play
instinct into school work, so there is a way of interesting the
factory and office worker in his job. However mechanical work may be,
there is always the interest in becoming the most efficient worker in
a room or a trade. Routine       accurate and detailed work       does not mean
the stultification of the imagination. It takes more imagination to
see the interesting things in statistical or record work than to write
a novel. Therefore employers should make it a point to help their
employees to realize the significance of the perfection of each detail
and the importance of each man's part. The other day a father said to
me, "I want my boys to be as ashamed to do work in which they are not
interested as to accept graft." When interest in work and efficiency
in work are regarded as of more importance than the immediate returns
for work, when it is as natural for boys and girls to demand enjoyment
and complete living in work as it is to thrill at the sight of [334]the
Stars and Stripes, do-nothing ailments will be less frequent and less
costly.

Work       that one enjoys       is an invaluable unpatented medicine. It can
make the sick well and keep the well from getting sick. It is the
chief reliance of mental hygiene. "I should have the grippe if I had
time," said a business woman to me the other day; but she did not have
time, hence she did not have the grippe.


If you're sick with something chronic,
And you think you need a tonic,
Do something.
There is life and health in doing,
There is pleasure in pursuing;
Doing, then, is health accruing       
Do something.

And if you're seeking pleasure,
Or enjoyment in full measure,
Do something.
Idleness, there's nothing in it;
'Twill not pay you for a minute       
Do something.







[335]

CHAPTER XXXIIIToC

HEREDITY BUGABOOS AND HEREDITY TRUTHS


One of the red-letter days of my life was that on which I learned that
I could not have inherited tuberculosis from two uncles who died of
consumption. For years I had known that I was a marked victim.
Silently I carried my tragedy, suspecting each cold and headache to be
the telltale messenger that should let others into my secret. He was a
veritable emancipator who informed me that heredity did not work from
uncle to nephew; that not more than a predisposition to consumption
could pass even from parent to child; that a predisposition to
consumption would come to nothing without the germ of the disease and
the environmental conditions which favor its development; and that if
those so predisposed avoid gross infection, lead a healthy life, and
breathe fresh air they are as safe as though no tuberculous lungs had
ever existed in the world. Some years later I learned to understand
the other side of the case; I realized how I had been in real danger
of contracting consumption in the darkened, ill-ventilated sick room
of the uncle who taught me my letters and gave me my ideal of God's
purpose in sending uncles to small boys.

There are two distinct things which make each individual life: the
living stuff, the physical basis of life, handed down from parent to
child; and the environmental conditions which surround it and play
upon it and rouse its reactions and its latent possibilities. It is
like the seed and the cultivation. You cannot grow corn from wheat,
but you can grow the best wheat, or you may let your crop fail through
careless handling.

[336]It is well that we should think seriously about the part played by
heredity, for the living stuff of the future depends upon our sense of
responsibility in this regard. The intelligent citizen would do well
to read such a book as J. Arthur Thompson's Heredity (1908), in
which the latest conclusions of science are clearly and soundly set
forth.

The main problem of to-day, however, is to use well the talents that
we have. Here two things should always be kept in mind: First, the
inherited elements which make up our minds and bodies are complex and
diverse. Health and strength are inherited as well as disease and
weakness; they have indeed a better chance of survival. In the most
unpromising ancestry there are latent potentialities which may be made
fruitful by effort. No limit whatever can be set to the possibilities
of improvement in any individual.

In the second place, if science has shown anything more clearly than
the importance of heredity, it is the importance of environment. This
influence upon human lives is within our control, and it is a grave
error to neglect what lies clearly within our power and to bemoan what
does not. Science has wrought no benefits greater than those which
result from drawing a clear line between heredity bugaboos and
heredity truths. An overemphasis on the hereditary factor in
development at the expense of the environmental factor, I call a
heredity bugaboo; and it is a tendency which cannot be too strongly
condemned. To fight against the sins and penalties of one's
grandfather is a forlorn task that quickly discourages. To overcome
diseases of environment, of shop and street, of house and school,
seems, on the contrary, an easy task. Heredity bugaboos dishearten,
enervate, encourage excesses and neglect. Heredity truths stimulate
remedial and preventive measures.

We may well watch with interest the progress of eugenics, that new
science which biologists and sociologists hope will some day remake
the very living stuff of the human [337]race. But meanwhile let us take up
with hope and courage and enthusiasm the great hemisphere of human
fate which lies within our grasp. Good food and fresh air, well-built
cities, enlightened schools and well-ordered industries, stable and
free and expert government,       given these things, we can transform the
world with the means now at our disposal. We can reap, if we will,
splendid possibilities now going to waste, and by intelligent
biological and sociological engineering we can hand on to the next
generation an environmental inheritance which will make their task far
easier than ours.

"Physical deterioration" is a bugaboo that is discovered by some in
heredity and by others in modern industrial evils. The British
director general called attention a few years ago to the fact that
from forty to sixty per cent of the men who were being examined for
military service were physically unfit. A Commission on Physical
Deterioration was appointed to investigate the cause, and to learn
whether the low physical standard of the would-be Tommy Atkins was due
to inherited defects. The results of this study were published in a
large volume called Report on Physical Deterioration, 1904, in which
is set forth a positive programme for obtaining periodically facts as
to the physique of the nation. In the course of the commission's
exhaustive investigation there was found no evidence that any
progressive deterioration was going on in any function of the body
except the teeth. "There are happily no grounds for associating dental
degeneracy with progressive physical deterioration." The increase in
optical defects is attributed not to the deterioration of the eye, but
to greater knowledge, more treatment, and better understanding of the
connection between optical defects and headache.

[338]




[339]




[340]The commission hoped "that the facts and opinions they have collected
will have some effect in allaying the apprehensions of those who, as
it appears, on insufficient grounds, have made up their minds that
progressive deterioration is to be found among people generally." In
regard to the facts which started the fear, the report says: (1) the
evidence adduced in the director general's memorandum was inadequate
to prove that physical deterioration had affected the classes referred
to; (2) no sufficient material (statistical or other) is at present
available to warrant any definite conclusions on the question of the
physique of the people by comparison with data obtained in past times.




THE BEST INHERITANCE IS A MOTHER WHO KNOWS HOW TO KEEP HER BABY WELL


The topics dealt with in the report refer to only a partial list of
conditions that need to be carefully studied before we can know what
environment heredity we are preparing for those who follow us:




I. As to Babies

Training of mothers, provident societies and maternity funds,
feeding of infants, milk supply, milk depots, sterilization and
[341]refrigeration of milk, effect of mother's employment upon infant
mortality, still births, cookery, hygiene and domestic economy,
public nurseries, cr        ches.



II. As to Children

Anthropometric measurements, sickness and open spaces, medical
examination of school children, teeth, eyes, and ears, games and
exercises for school children, open spaces and gymnastic
apparatus, physical exercise for growing girls and growing boys,
clubs and cadet corps, feeding of elementary school children,
partial exemption from school, special schools for "retarded"
children, special magistrate for juvenile cases, juvenile smoking,
organization of existing agencies for the welfare of lads and
girls, education, school attendance in rural districts, defective
children.



III. As to Living and Working Conditions

Register of sickness, medical certificates as to causes of death,
overcrowding, building and open spaces, register of owners of
buildings, unsanitary and overcrowded house property, rural
housing, workshops, coal mines, etc., medical inspection of
factories, employment of women in factories, labor colonies,
overfatigue, food and cooking, cooking grates, adulteration, smoke
pollution, alcohol, syphilis, insanity.



IV. As to Health Machinery

Medical officers of health, local, district, and national boards,
health associations.

Scientists of the next generation will continue to differ as to
heredity truths and heredity bugaboos unless records are kept now,
showing the physical condition of school children and of applicants
for work certificates and for civil service and army positions. The
British investigators declared that "anthropometric records are the
only accredited tests available, and, if collected on a sufficient
scale, they would constitute the supreme criterion of physical
deterioration, or the reverse.... The school population and [342]the
classes coming under the administration of the Factory Acts offer
ready material for the immediate application of such tests." In
addition to the physical tests proposed in other chapters, there is
great educational opportunity in the records of private and public
hospitals. Every nation, every state, and every city should enlist all
its educational and scientific forces to ascertain in what respects
social efficiency is endangered by physical deficiencies that can be
avoided only by restricting parenthood, and the environmental
deficiencies that can be avoided by efficient health machinery.

The greatest of all heredity truths are these: (1) the deficiencies of
infants are infinitesimal compared with the deficiencies of the world
with which we surround them; (2) each of us can have a part in
begetting for posterity an environment of health and of opportunity.






[343]

CHAPTER XXXIVToC

INEFFECTIVE AND EFFECTIVE WAYS OF COMBATING ALCOHOLISM


Wherever the Stars and Stripes fly over school buildings it is made
compulsory to teach the evils of alcoholism. For nearly a generation
the great majority of school children of the United States have been
taught that alcohol, in however small quantities, is a poison and a
menace to personal and national health and prosperity. Yet during this
very period the per capita consumption of every kind of alcoholic
beverage has increased. Whereas 16.49 gallons of spirituous liquors
were consumed per capita of population in 1896, 22.27 gallons were
used in 1906. Obviously the results of methods hitherto in vogue for
combating alcoholism are disappointing.

Why this paradoxical relation of precept to practice? Why is this, the
most hygiene-instructed country in the world, the Elysium of the
patent-medicine and cocaine traffic? If we have only the expected
divergence of achievement from ideal, then there is nothing for us to
do but to congratulate ourselves and posterity upon the part played by
compulsory legislation in committing all states and territories to
hygiene instruction in all public schools. If, on the other hand, our
disappointment is due to ineffective method, then the next step is to
change our method.

The chief purpose of school hygiene has hitherto been not to promote
personal and community health, but to lessen the use of alcohol and
tobacco. Arguments were required against whisky, beer, cigars, and
cigarettes. As the strongest arguments would probably make the most
lasting impression upon the school child and the best profits for
[344]author and bookseller, writers vied with one another in the rhetoric
and hyperbole of platform agitation. What effect would it have upon
you if you were exhorted frequently during the next eight years to
avoid tobacco because a mother once killed a child by washing its head
in tobacco water? What is the effect on the mind of a boy or a girl
who sees that the family doctor, the minister, the teacher, the judge,
the governor, the President, and the philanthropist use tobacco and
alcoholic beverages, when taught that "boys who use tobacco and
alcoholic beverages will find closed in their faces the doors to
strength, good health, skill in athletics, good scholarship, long
life, best companions, many business positions, highest success"? It
is probably true that "a boy once drank some whisky from a flask and
died within a few hours." But that story is about as typical of boys
and of whisky as that a boy once drank whisky from a flask and did not
die for ninety years afterwards, or that George Washington drank
whisky and became the Father of his Country.

How special pleading has dominated the teaching of school hygiene is
illustrated by a recent book which, for the most part, successfully
breaks away from the narrow point of view and the crude methods
hitherto prevailing. It presents the following facts concerning New
York City:



  
  Saloons
  10,821
  
  
  Arrests
  133,749
  
  
  Expense of police department
  $10,199,206
  
  
  Police courts, jails, workhouses, reformatories
  1,310,411
  
  
  Hospitals, asylums, and other charities
  4,754,380
  



It is fair to the author to state that she does not declare in so many
words that the shutting up of the saloons would obviate all the
arrests and all the hospital, jail, and charity bills. Instead of
wipe out she says shrivel. No truth would have been lost by
avoiding all misrepresentation.

[345]The author probably felt as I did when I took my total abstainer's
protest to a celebrated scientist who had exposed certain
misstatements regarding the effect of small quantities of alcohol: "Is
not the untruth of these exaggerated statements less dangerous than
the untruth of dispassionate, scientific statement? So long as the
child mind takes in only an impression, is it not better to write this
impression indelibly?" He sadly but indulgently replied, "And in what
other studies would you substitute exaggeration for truth?"

The reaction has already begun against exaggeration in hygiene
text-books, against drawing lessons from accidental or exceptional
cases of excessive use of alcohol, against classing moderate drinking
and smoking with drunkenness as sins of equal magnitude, and against
overlooking grave social and industrial evils that threaten children
far earlier and more frequently than do tobacco and alcohol. Instead
of adding an ell to the truth, text-book writers are now adding only
an inch or two at a time. No longer do we favor highly colored charts
that picture in purple, green, and black the effect of stimulants and
narcotics upon the heart and brain, the stomach, the liver, the knee,
and the eardrum, assuming that all resultant evils are concentrated
in one organ. Menacing habits, such as overeating and indulgence in
self-pity, are beginning to receive attention. It is also true that
physiology and anatomy are progressively made more interesting.
Publishers are looking for the utmost originality compatible with the
purpose of the present laws and with the only effective public
sentiment that has hitherto been interested in the interpretation of
those laws.

A score of improvements in the method of carrying out a small ideal
will not take the place of enlarging that ideal. If existing laws
stand in the way of broadening the purpose of school hygiene, let the
laws be changed. If text-book publishers stand in the way, let us
induce or compel them to get out of the way. If we fear rumsellers,
their money, [346]and the insidious political methods that they might
employ to bring in undertruth if overtruth is once sacrificed, let us
go to our communities and locate the rumseller's guns, draw their
fire, tell the truth about their opposition, and educate the public to
overcome it. If, on the other hand, misguided teetotalism stands in
the way, then, as one teetotaler, I suggest that we prove, as we can,
in our respective communities that there is a better way of
inculcating habits of temperance and self-restraint than by telling
untruths, overtruths, or half truths about alcohol and tobacco. Let us
prove, as we can, that a subject vital to every individual, to every
industry, and to every government is now prevented from fulfilling its
mission not by its enemies but by its friends. We can learn the
character of hygiene instruction in our schools and the interest taken
in it by teachers, principals, and superintendents. We can learn how
teachers practice hygiene at school, and how the children of our
communities are affected by the hygiene instruction now given.
Finally, we can compel a public discussion of the facts, and action in
accordance with facts. Without questioning anybody's avowed motive, we
can learn how big that motive is and how adequate or inadequate is the
method of executing it.

Alcohol and tobacco really occupy but a very small share of the
interest and attention of even those men and women by whom they are
habitually used. Hygiene, on the other hand, is of constant,
uninterrupted concern. Why, therefore, should it be planned to have
alcohol and tobacco displace the broader subject of personal and
public hygiene in the attention and interest of children throughout
the school life? Beyond the text-book and schoolroom a thousand
influences are at work to teach the social evils, the waste of energy,
and the unhappiness that always accompany the excessive use       and
frequently result from a moderate use       of stimulants and narcotics. Of
the many reasons for not drinking and smoking, physiology gives those
that least [347]interest and impress the child. The secondary effects,
rather than the immediate effects, are those that determine a child's
action. Most of the direct physiological effects are, in the majority
of instances, less serious in themselves than the effects of
overeating, of combining milk with acids, of eating irregularly, of
neglecting constipation. Were it not for the social and industrial
consequences of drunkenness and nicotinism, it is doubtful if the most
lurid picture of fatty degeneration, alcoholic consumption, hardened
liver, inactive stomach lining, would outweigh the pleasing       and
deceiving       sensations of alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.

The strong appeal to the child or man is the effect these habits have
upon his mother, his employer, his wife, his children. The vast
majority of us will avoid or stop using anything that makes us
offensive to those with whom we are most intimately associated, and to
those upon whom our professional and industrial promotion depends.
Children will profit from drill in and out of school in the science of
avoiding offense and of giving happiness, but unless the
categories       acts that give offense and acts that give
happiness       are wide enough to include the main acts committed in the
normal relations of son, companion, employer, husband, father, and
citizen, those who set out to avoid alcohol and tobacco find
themselves ill equipped to carry the obligations of a temperate,
law-abiding citizen.

Things do not happen as described in the early text-book. Other things
not mentioned hinder progress and happiness. The child at work resents
the mis-education received at school and suspects that he has been
following false gods. The enemies that cause him trouble come from
unexpected sources. He finds it infinitely easier to eschew alcohol
and tobacco than to avoid living conditions that insidiously undermine
his aversion to stimulants and narcotics. The reasons for avoiding
stimulants in the interest of others are more [348]numerous and more
cogent than the reasons for avoiding stimulants and narcotics for
one's own sake. The altruistic reasons for shunning stimulants and
narcotics cannot be implanted in the child unless he sees the evil of
excess per se in anything and everything, and unless he becomes
thoroughly grounded in the life relations and health relations to
which he must adapt himself.

Unclean streets, unclean milk, congested tenements, can do more harm
than alcohol and tobacco, because they breed a physique that craves
stimulants and drugs. Adenoids and defective vision will injure a
larger proportion of the afflicted than will alcohol and tobacco,
because they earlier and more certainly substitute discouragement for
hope, handicap for equal chance. Failure to enforce health laws is a
more serious menace to health and morals than drunkenness or tobacco
cancer.

If it is true that we must attack the problem of alcohol from the
standpoint of its social and industrial effects, we are forced at once
to consider the machinery by which cities and governments control the
manufacture and sale of alcohol. It is not an exaggeration to say that
courses in regulating the traffic in alcohol are more necessary than
courses in the effects of alcohol upon digestion and respiration.

If Sunday closing of saloons, local option, high license, and
prohibition have failed, there is no evidence that the failure is due
to the principles underlying any one of these methods. Until more
earnest effort is made to study the effects of these methods, the
results of their enforcement and the causes of their nonenforcement,
no one is justified in declaring that either policy is successful or
unsuccessful. It is very easy to select from the meager facts now
available convincing proofs both that prohibition does not prohibit
and that high license leads to increased drunkenness. The consequence
is that the movements to control, restrict, or prohibit the use of
alcohol are emotional, not rational.

[349]It is impossible to keep emotion, sensation, sentiment, at white heat.
Most extremists worship legislation and do not try to keep interest
alive by telling every week or every month new facts about the week or
the month before. No new fuel is added to the anti-saloon fire, which
gradually cools and dies down. Not so, however, with those who make
money by the sale of intoxicants. The greater the opposition, the more
brains, the more effort, the more money they put into overcoming or
circumventing that opposition. Fuel is piled on and the bonfire is fed
freely. Every day the anti-restriction bonfire becomes larger and
larger, and the anti-saloon bonfire becomes smaller and smaller. By
carefully selecting their facts, by counting the number of arrests for
drunkenness and the number of saloons open on Sunday, by reiteration
of their story the pro-saloonists gradually win recruits from the
opposition, and, when the next election comes, their friends outnumber
their enemies and the "dry" policy of a city, county, or state is
reversed.

The failures attributed to prohibitive or restrictive measures are
probably no more numerous than the failures of government in other
respects. The present ambassador from England, James Bryce, writing
his American Commonwealth, declared that municipal government was
America's "most conspicuous failure." The mayor of Toledo, writing in
1907, says, "There has been a pessimism, almost enthusiastic, about
the city." These failures are due not to any lack of desire for good
government, not to any fundamental evils of cities, but to the fact
that municipal reform, like the crusade against alcohol, has been
based upon emotionalism, not upon definite proof. Reformers have been
unable to lead in the right direction, because they have looked at
their lantern instead of their road. Not having cumulative information
as to government acts, they have been unable to keep their fires
burning. To illustrate: in November, 1907, the governor of New York
state, the [350]mayor of New York City, and reformers of national
reputation eulogized the tenement-house department; yet this
department, whose founding was regarded as a national benefaction, was
the only department of the city government that did not receive an
increase for 1908. It is in the position of temperance legislation,
the facts of whose enforcement or nonenforcement are not promptly and
continuously made public.

Fear of the negro victim of alcoholism, social evils of intemperance,
whether among white or black, industrial uncertainty and waste due to
alcoholism, are the three chief motives that have swept alcohol
traffic out of the greater part of the South. Knowledge of
physiological evils has had little influence, except as it may have
rendered more acceptable the claim that alcoholism is a disease
against which there is no insurance except abolition of alcohol as a
beverage. Religious revivals, street parades by day and by night,
illustrated banners, personal intercession, lines of women and
children at the polls, made it necessary for voters to make known
their intention, and made it extremely difficult for respectable men,
engaged in respectable business, to vote for saloons. Some states have
gone so far as to prohibit the manufacture of alcoholic stimulants,
even though not offered for sale within state limits. In Georgia wine
cannot be used at the communion service, nor can druggists sell any
form of liquor except pure alcohol. In Louisiana it is illegal for
representatives of "wet districts" to solicit orders for liquor in any
of the "dry districts." In Texas the sale of liquor in dining cars is
forbidden, and the traveler may not even drink from his own flask.
Congress is being urged by senators and congressmen, as well as by
anti-saloon advocates, to pass laws prohibiting common carriers from
delivering alcoholics to any "dry" community. The more optimistic
anti-saloon workers believe it is but a matter of a short time when
Congress will pass laws prohibiting [351]the manufacture or sale of
alcoholic beverages within any limits protected by the United States
Constitution.

Southern states have been warned that they could not afford the
depreciation of real estate values, of rents, and of business that
would surely follow the "confiscation of capital" and "interference
with personal liberty." This warning has been met by plausible
arguments that the buyers of legitimate and nonpoisonous commodities
could pay better rents, better profits on business and on real estate,
if freed from the uneven fight against temptation to drink. The
argument that schools and streets and health must suffer if the
license money was withdrawn, has been met by the plausible argument
that the ultimate taxpayer       the family that wants clothing, food, and
shelter       will save enough money to be able to spend still larger sums
than heretofore upon education, health, and public safety.

For the first time dealers in alcohol recognize the possibility of a
great national movement and of national prohibition. Both the defects
in methods hitherto used to oppose saloon legislation and the reasons
for meeting the present situation by new methods are presented in the
May issue (1907) of the Transactions of the American Brewing
Institute. Under the title, "Social Order and the Saloon       the Measure
of the Brewer's Responsibility," Mr. Hugh F. Fox, known throughout the
Union as a defender of child rights, advocate of probation and
children's courts, promoter of health and education, outlined a plan
for research that is indispensable to the proper settling of this
great question. Whether brewer or anti-saloon leaguist, total
abstainer or moderate drinker, employer or trade unionist, it is
necessary to the intelligent control of alcohol that each of us
approach this momentous question of control or abolition of the saloon
in the spirit expressed in this paper, whose thoroughness and whose
social point of view would do credit to a church conference. The
address is [352]quoted and its questions copied because both show how much
depends upon knowing whether laws are enforced and how much greater is
the difficulty of coping with a conciliatory antagonist who professes
willingness to submit to tests of evidence.

The regulation of the liquor business involves fundamental
questions of the function and scope of government, and there is
hardly any department of organized human activity that has been
the subject of so much experiment and futile tinkering.... The
only people who are perfectly consistent are the prohibitionists,
whose policy is abolition. Let us, however, try to detach
ourselves from any personal interest that we may have in the
subject, and consider it impartially as a matter of public
concern.

What the brewer as an individual cannot do, the brewers as an
organization have done successfully in many places in spite
sometimes of official negligence, corruption, or incapacity. The
Texas Brewers' Association is reported as having successfully
prosecuted two thousand cases against keepers of disreputable
resorts during the past three years. The object of their campaign
was to purify the retail liquor trade from unclean and law-defying
elements.

The greatest gain that has come to society, as distinguished from
the individual, through the temperance movement is its effect in
unconsciously informing the public that the regulation and
administration of licensing is in itself a great and vital
problem; and as a secondary result of such agitation, I should
cite the growing sensitiveness of all persons in the business to
the power of public opinion.

The recognition by brewers of the force of public opinion is a
recent affair. In former years they were totally indifferent to
it, if indeed they did not openly flout it. Even now their appeal
to public sentiment is mainly a special plea for defensive
purposes, and has little or no educational value. Brewers have
opposed practically every effort to effect a change in excise
laws, often without any convincing reason, but simply because the
proposed change involved temporary inconvenience and uncertainty,
and perhaps a temporary loss. The brewing trade has utterly failed
to develop a constructive programme in connection with the public
[353]regulation of its affairs. It does not seem to have any fixed
principles or positive convictions as to excise methods and liquor
laws. Its policy has been that of an opportunist, at the best,       or
an obstructionist, at the worst. As in all other industries which
affect the welfare of the people, reforms have been forced from
the outside, with no help from within. Of course this is equally
true of insurance and railroad corporations, of food purveyors,
mine owners, cotton merchants, and a score of other interests. It
is due not merely to human selfishness but to shortsightedness; in
other words, to a lack of statesmanship.

To call your opponents hypocrites, cranks, fakirs, and fanatics
may relieve your feelings, but it doesn't convince anybody, and
only hurts a just cause. It is foolish to question the motives of
men who, without thought of personal gain, are trying to remedy
the evils of inebriety.

The church is perfectly right in urging total abstinence upon the
individual. The only path of safety lies in abstinence for some
individuals....

The recognition of the right of a community to establish its own
licensing conditions carries with it the right of the community to
determine whether there shall be any licenses at all!

To make the discussion of this subject as fruitful as possible, I
venture to submit the following questions for your consideration.
None of them involve any direct moral issue, but there is an
honest difference of opinion about each one of them, and they are
certainly of vital importance in determining the course of wise
and just administration.

What has been the effect of high license?

How much public revenue should the traffic yield?

Does high license stimulate unlawful trade?

How much license tax should be imposed upon local bottlers and
grocers? Should they be allowed to peddle beer or to sell it in
single bottles?

Should the place or the individual be licensed?

Should the licensing authorities be appointive or elective? By
whom should they be appointed, and for what term of office?

Have the courts made good or bad licensing authorities? Where the
courts issue licenses, what has been the effect on the court?

[354]Should the licensing authority alone have the power to revoke a
license, and discretion to withhold a license?

How can the licensing authority enforce the law? Should it not be
independent of the police?

What should be the penalty for breach of the law? Do not severe
penalties miscarry?

On what plea, and under what conditions, should licenses be
transferred?

What has been the effect of limiting the number of saloons?

Should limitation be according to area or to population?

Is there any relation between the number of saloons and the volume
of consumption?

What should be the limit to the hours of selling?

Should saloons be allowed to become places of entertainment?

How can the sale of liquor by druggists be controlled?

How can spurious drinking clubs be prevented or controlled?

How can the operation of disreputable hotels be prevented? What
should be the definition of a hotel? Who should define it? By whom
should it be licensed? What special privileges should be given to
it?

How can the "back-room" evil be stopped? Is it legal (i.e.
constitutional) to prohibit the sale or serving of liquor to
women?

Has the removal of screens reduced the volume of consumption? Has
it improved the character of saloons? Has it solved the problem of
Sunday prohibition for any length of time? What has been the
general effect of it in the tenement districts?

Should the state undertake to regulate the liquor business or to
enforce liquor laws?

Is it possible to devise any working plan which will apply with
equal effectiveness and equity in communities of compact and of
scattered population?

Should, or should not, the principle of self-government be
carefully preserved in the whole scheme of legislation to regulate
the liquor business?

Whether the present prohibition wave shall wash away the legalized
saloon, as ocean waves have from time to time engulfed peninsulas,
islands, and whole continents, [355]depends upon the power of American
educators and American officials to answer right such questions as the
foregoing. The great danger is that we shall, as usual, over-emphasize
lawmaking, underemphasize lawbreaking, and go to sleep during the next
two or three years when we should be wide-awake and constantly active
in seeing that the law is enforced. Unless exactly the same principles
of law enforcement are applied in "dry districts" as we have urged for
eradication of smallpox, typhoid, scarlet fever, and adenoids, local
and city prohibition are doomed to failure. There must be:

1. Inspection to discover disease centers       "blind pigs," "blind
tigers," etc.

2. Compulsory notification by parents and landlords, and by police
and other officials.

3. Prompt investigation upon complaint from private citizens.

4. Prompt removal of the disease and disinfection of the center.

5. Segregation of individual units that disseminate disease,
whether bartender, saloon keeper, owner of premises, or
respectable wholesaler, none of whom should be permitted to shift
to another the responsibility for violating liquor laws.

6. Persistent publicity as to the facts regarding enforcement and
violation, so that no one, whether saloon leaguist or anti-saloon
leaguist, shall be uninformed as to the current results of "dry"
laws.

It is perfectly safe to assume that none of these things will be done
consistently unless funds are provided to pay one or more persons in
each populous locality to give their entire time to the enforcement of
laws, just as the improvement of other ills of municipal government
require the constant attention of trained investigators. Cogent
arguments for such funds have recently appeared in the New York
Evening Post's symposium on "How to Give Wisely," by Mrs. Emma
Garrett Boyd, of Atlanta, and Miss Salmon, of Vassar College.

[356]If the saloon is here to stay, we must all agree that it is a
frightful waste of human energy and of educational momentum to be
appealing for its abolition when we might be hastening its proper
control. On the other hand, if the saloon is destined to be abolished
as a public nuisance and a private wrong, as a menace to industry and
social order, is it not a frightful, unforgivable waste of energy to
permit prohibition laws to fail, and thus to discredit the principle
of prohibition? Philanthropists have provided millions for scientific
research, for medical research, for the study of tuberculosis, and for
the study of living conditions. It is to be hoped that a large
benefaction, or that an aggregation of small benefactions, will apply
to governmental attempts to regulate the sale of alcohol those methods
of scientific research which have released men from the thraldom of
ignorance and diseases less easily preventable than alcoholism.






[357]

CHAPTER XXXVToC

IS IT PRACTICABLE IN PRESENTING TO CHILDREN THE EVILS OF ALCOHOLISM TO
TELL THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH?


If children are taught that the most effective way of combating
alcoholism is to insure the enforcement of existing laws and to profit
from lessons taught by such enforcement; if children are taught that
the strongest reasons for total abstinence are social, economic, and
industrial rather than individual and physiological,       there is much to
be gained and little to lose from telling them the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth about alcohol. To stimulate a child's
imagination by untruths about alcohol is as vicious as to stimulate
his body with alcohol. Whisky drinking does not always lead to
drunkenness, to physical incapacity, to short life, or to obvious loss
of vitality. Beer drinking is not always objected to by employers.
Neither crime, poverty, immorality, lack of ambition, nor ignorance
can always be traced to alcohol. On the contrary, it is unquestionably
true that the majority of the nation's heroes have used alcoholics
moderately or excessively for the greater part of their lives. It is
probably true that among the hundred most eminent officials, pastors,
merchants, professors, and scientists of to-day, the great majority of
each class are moderate users of one or more forms of alcoholics.
Overeating of potatoes or cake or meat, sleeping or working in
ill-ventilated rooms, neglect of constipation, may occasion
physiological and industrial [358]injuries that are not only as grave in
themselves as the evils of moderate drinking, but, in addition,
actually tempt to moderate drinking.

All of this can be safely admitted, because whether parents and
teachers admit it or deny it, children by observation and by reading
will become convinced that up to the year 1908 the noblest and the
most successful men of America, as well as the most depraved and least
successful, have used alcoholics. To be candid enough to admit this
enables us to gain a hold upon the confidence and the intelligence of
children and youth that will strengthen our arguments, based upon
social and industrial as well as physiological grounds, against
running the risks that are inevitably incurred by even the moderate
use of alcohol.

Other things being equal, the same man will do better work without
alcohol than with alcohol; the same athlete will be stronger and more
alert without alcohol than with alcohol; the clerk or lawyer or
teacher will win promotion earlier without alcohol than with alcohol;
man or woman will grow old quicker with than without alcohol. Other
things being equal, a man of fifty will have greater confidence in a
total abstainer than in a man of identical capacity who uses alcohol
moderately; a mother will give better vitality and better care to her
children without than with alcohol; a policeman or fireman or
stenographer is more apt to win promotion without than with alcohol.
Whatever the physical ailment, there is in every instance a better
remedy for an acute trouble, and infinitely better remedies for
deep-seated troubles, than alcoholics.

The percentage of failure to use alcoholics moderately is so high, the
uncertainty as to a particular individual's ability to drink
moderately is so great, as to lead certain insurance companies, first,
to give preference to men who never use alcoholics, and later, to
refuse to insure moderate drinkers. Life insurance companies have the
general rule [359]that habitual drinkers are bad risks, as the alcohol
habit is prejudicial to health and longevity; but they have no means
of studying the risk of moderate drinkers, because, except where
alcohol has already left a permanent impression upon the system, the
indications are by no means such as to enable the medical examiner to
trace its existence with certainty. For this reason the life insurance
companies have little effect in preventing alcoholism. Though they
are agreed that habitual drinkers ought to be declined altogether,
only a few companies have taken the decided stand of declining them.
"Habitual drinkers, if not too excessive, are admitted into the
general class where the expected mortality, according to the
experience of the Pennsylvania Mutual Life Insurance Company, is 80
per cent, as against 56 per cent for the temperate class. Though it is
only necessary to look over the death losses presented each day to see
that intemperance in the use of liquors, as shown by cirrhosis of the
liver, Bright's disease, diseases of the heart, brain, and nervous
system, is the cause of a large proportion of the deaths, these
companies prefer to grade the premiums accordingly rather than to
decline habitual drinkers altogether. While this is partly due to the
difficulty and expense of diagnosis, it is more probably due to an
objection to take a definite stand on the temperance question."

Thus the insurance companies' rules touch only the confirmed drinker,
whose physique is often irreparably injured. One company writes: "Men
who have been intemperate and taken the Keeley or other cures are
never accepted until five years have elapsed from the date of taking
the cure, and only when it can be conclusively shown that during the
whole period they have refrained entirely from the use of alcoholic
liquor, and that their former excesses have not in any way impaired
the physical risk."

Thus far American insurance companies are doing little preventive and
educational work on the alcohol question, [360]though they have the very
best means at their command for so doing. According to the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company nine tenths of the school children
in New York City are insured by them, and an even greater proportion
of workingmen. Even though this is done "at twice the normal cost,"
the most cursory medical examination is given and no attempt is made
to instruct them in the relation of their physical condition to their
working power, or in the evils of the alcohol and the smoking habits.

Naturally the moderate drinker is first rejected for positions where
an occasional overindulgence would be most noticeable and most
serious. The manager of a large factory tells his men: "You cannot
work here unless you are sober. If you must drink at parties, stay at
home if necessary until 12 o'clock the next day and sleep it off, but
don't come here till you are straight. We cannot afford it."
Occasionally his men stay at home and not a word is said, but the
minute they are found at work in an unsteady condition they are
summarily discharged. From this position it is but a step to that of
an upholsterer in New York City, who prints on his order blanks, "No
drinking man employed." His company recently discharged a man after
twenty years of service because a customer for whom this man was
working detected a whisky breath. Men reported to trade unions for
frequent intoxication are blacklisted. A certain financial corporation
permits no liquor on its grounds or in its lunch rooms. The head of
one of its large branches was heard to say recently that he would
discharge on the spot a man who showed evidences of drinking, even
though he had previously worked faithfully for years.

Rejection of moderate drinkers by business houses is not done on moral
grounds alone, but because experience has proved the danger of
employing men who have not their faculties fully under control all
the time they are at work. The rules are especially strict for men
working for a railroad [361]or street railway company. The Pennsylvania
Railroad Company replied to my inquiry as to their custom of
discriminating against drinking men in these words: "We have no
printed rules in regard to this except in a general way,       that no
employee is allowed to go into a saloon during his hours of work or
wearing the company's uniform. Of course the men are promptly
discharged or disciplined if they show the effects of liquor while on
duty, and the whole tendency of the administration of the rules is to
get rid of any men who are habitual drinkers, but the administration
of the rules and discipline is left to the superintendent of each
division." The Interborough Rapid Transit Company of New York has
these printed rules for the physical standard required for applicants
for employment:

1. Examination of heart and arteries. Rejection of candidates
showing excessive or long-continued use of tobacco and alcohol,
with explanation of condition, causes, and dangers of continued
use. Warning to chiefs of departments regarding those accepted who
show tendency to drink at times, but whose physical examination
does not disclose sufficient evidence to warrant their
disqualifications. Foremen and chiefs of departments to be
notified and to carry out the policy of employing only men who are
at all times sober and not under the influence of alcohol at all.

2. On re      xamination of employees. Warning to or rejection of
those showing, on physical examination, indulgence to excess of
alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. Warning to chief of department of
evidence of such habits on part of any employee examined for any
reason, but retained in service of the company with injunction to
chief of department to speak with such employee and have him under
proper supervision.

The blacklisting of habitual drinkers by their union, and the growing
tendency on the part of large corporations, factories, and business
houses to take a decided stand against drinking, are having a marked
effect in reducing drunkenness where it does most harm. This practice
has been declared by John Bach McMasters, the noted American
historian, to have exerted a stronger influence in promoting
temperance and total abstinence than all the temperance crusades from
Hartley's time to the prohibition wave of [362]1907. The school, by
instructing children how the alcohol habit will affect their chances
of business success, future usefulness as citizens, and enjoyment of
life, will inevitably reduce the evils of alcohol. By teaching based
on facts that intimately concern the life of the child, as well as by
caring for his health and his environment, the schools can help
supplant the desire for alcohol with other more healthy desires.

No truth about alcohol is more important than that the craving for
alcohol or something just as bad will exist side by side with
imperfect sanitation, too long hours of work, food that fails to
nourish, lack of exercise, rest, and fresh air. Conditions that
produce bounding vitality and offer freedom for its expression at work
and at play will supplant the craving for stimulants. Finally, the
great truth contained in the last chapter must be taught, that success
in coping with alcoholism is a community task requiring efficient
government above all else.

CHAPTER XXXVIToC

FIGHTING TOBACCO EVILS


"It is not necessarily vicious or harmful to soothe excited nerves."
This editorial comment explains, even if it condemns while trying to
justify, the tobacco habit. To soothe excited nerves by lying to them
about their condition and by weakening where we promise to nourish, is
vicious and harmful just as other lying and robbery are vicious and
harmful. Yet two essential facts in dealing with tobacco evils must be
considered: tobacco does soothe excited nerves, and the harm done to
the majority of smokers seems to them to be negligible. For these two
reasons the tobacco user, unless frightened by effects already
visible, refuses to listen to physiological arguments against his
amiable self-indulgence. Cheerfully he admits the theoretical
possibility that by its method of soothing nerves tobacco kills nerve
energy. But in all sincerity he points to men who have found the right
stopping point up to which tobacco hurts less perhaps than coffee or
tea, candy or lobster, overeating or undersleeping. Therefore the
physician, the bishop, the school superintendent, candidly run the
necessary risk for the sake of nerve soothing and sociability.

Less harm would be done by tobacco if it were more harmful. Like so
many other food poisons, its use in small quantities does not produce
the prompt, vivid, unequivocal results that remove all doubt as to the
user's injuries and intemperance. As inability to see the
physiological effect upon himself encourages the tobacco user to
continue smoking or chewing, so failure to identify evil physiological
effects upon the smoker encourages the nonuser to begin [364]smoking or
chewing. A very few smokers give up the habit because they fear its
results, but too often the man who can see the evil results would
rather give up almost anything else. The one motive that most
frequently stops inveterate smoking       fear       is the least effective
motive in dissuading those who have not yet acquired the habit; every
young man, unless already suffering from known heart trouble, thinks
he will smoke moderately and without harm. Unfortunately, every boy
who begins to smoke succeeds in picturing to himself the adult who
shows no surface sign of injury from tobacco, rather than some other
boy who has been stunted physically, mentally, and morally by
cigarettes.

For adult and child, therefore, it behooves us to find some other
weapons against tobacco evils in addition to fear of physiological
injuries. Among these weapons are:

1. Enforcement of existing laws that make it an offense against
society for dealer, parent, or other person to furnish children under
sixteen with tobacco in any form; and raising the age limit to
twenty-one, or at least to eighteen.

2. Enforcement of restrictions as to place and time when smoking is
permitted.

3. Agitation against tobacco as a private and public nuisance.

4. Explanation of commercial advantages of abstinence.

Because the childish body quickly shows the injurious effects of what
in adults would be called moderate smoking, the proper physical
examination of school children will reveal injuries which in turn will
show where and to what extent the cigarette evil exists among the
children of a community. Even the scientists who claim that "in some
cases tobacco aids digestion," or that "tobacco may be used without
bad effects when used moderately by people who are in condition to use
it," declare emphatically that tobacco "must not be used in any form
by growing children or youths." Prohibitive laws can be rigidly
enforced if a small [365]amount of attention is given to organizing the
strong public sentiment that exists against demoralizing children by
tobacco. Thus children and youths will not need to make a decision
regarding their own use of tobacco until after other arguments than
physiological fear have been used for many years by parent, teacher,
and society.

One effective weapon is the sign on a ferryboat or street car: "No
smoking allowed on this side," or "Smoking allowed on three rear seats
only." Public halls and vehicles in increasing numbers either prohibit
smoking altogether or put smokers to some considerable inconvenience.
The trouble involved in going to places where smoking is permitted
tends gradually to irritate the nerves beyond the power of tobacco to
soothe. Again, many men would rather not soothe their excited nerves
after five, than have their nerves excited all day waiting for freedom
to smoke. Restrictions as to time or place make possible and expedite
still further restrictions. Thus gradually the army of occasional
smokers or nonsmokers is being recruited from the army of regular
smokers.

The anti-nuisance motive follows closely upon the drawing of sharp
lines of time and place for the use of tobacco. Like treason, smoking
in the presence of nonsmokers can be considered respectable only when
the numbers who profess and practice it are numerous. If the two
first-mentioned weapons are effectively used, there will be an
increasing proportion of nonsmokers and not-yet-smokers who will give
attentive ear to proof that nicotinism is a nuisance. The physical
evidences of the cigarette habit can easily be made distasteful to all
nonsmokers if frankly pointed out,       the yellow fingers, the yellow
teeth, the nasty breath, the offensive excretions from the pores that
saturate the garments of all who cannot afford a daily change of
underwear. The anti-nuisance argument is always insidious and abiding.
In the presence of nonsmokers accustomed to [366]regard tobacco using as a
nuisance, smokers become self-conscious and sensitive. Men and women
alike would prefer a reputation for cleanliness to the pleasures of
tobacco. The educational possibility of fighting tobacco with the name
"nuisance" was recognized the other day by an editorial that protested
against a law to prevent women from using cigarettes in restaurants.
"The way for any man who has the desire to reform some woman addicted
to the cigarette habit is insidiously and gently to point out the
injurious effects on her appearance. Cigarette smoking stains a
woman's fingers and discolors her teeth. It also tends to make her
complexion sallow and to detract from the rubiness of her lips. It
bedims the sparkle of her eyes. It makes her less attractive
mornings." Chewing has practically disappeared, not because it ceased
to soothe excited nerves but because it was seen to be a nasty
nuisance.

Finally, the selfishness of the smoker is a nuisance that continues
only because it has not been called by its right name. "Do you mind if
I smoke?" was a polite question two hundred years ago when tobacco was
rare enough to make smoking a distinction, or fifty years ago when
everybody smoked at home and in public. But it is effrontery to-day
when people do mind, when smoking pollutes the air of drawing room and
office, and while soothing the excited nerves of the smoker lowers the
vitality of nonsmokers compelled to breathe smoke-laden air. It is
selfish to intrude upon others a personal weakness or a personal
appetite. It is selfish to divert from family purposes to "soothing
excited nerves" even the small amounts necessary to maintain the cigar
or cigarette habit. It is selfish to run the risk of shortening one's
life, of reducing one's earning capacity. Because the tobacco habit is
selfish it is anti-social and a nuisance, and should be fought by
social as well as personal weapons, as are other recognized nuisances,
such as spitting in public or offensive manners.

[367]The economic motive for avoiding and for eliminating tobacco is
gaining in strength. The soothing qualities of all drugs are found to
be expensive to physical and business energy if enjoyed during
business hours. Strangely enough, employers who smoke are quite as apt
as are nonsmokers, to forbid the use of tobacco by employees at work.
Some of this seeming inconsistency is due to a dislike for cheaper
tobacco or for mixed brands in one atmosphere; some of it is due to
the smoker's knowledge that "soothing nerves" and sustained attention
do not go hand in hand, while "pipe dreams" and unproductive
meditation are fast companions; finally no little of the opposition to
tobacco in business is due to fear of fire. These various motives,
combining with the anti-nuisance motive among nonsmokers, have led
many business enterprises to prohibit the use of tobacco in any form
on their premises or during business hours, even when on the premises
of others. Notable examples are railroads that permit no passenger
trainman to use tobacco while on duty. (Freight trainmen are
restricted more tardily because the risk of damages is less and the
anti-nuisance objection is wanting.)

From penalizing excessive use and prohibiting moderate use in business
hours, it is a short cut to choosing men who never use tobacco and
thus never suffer any of its effects and never exhibit any of its
offensive evidences. No young man expects to obtain a favorable
hearing if he offers himself for employment while smoking or chewing
tobacco. Business men dislike to receive tobacco-scented messengers.
Cars and elevators contain signs prohibiting lighted cigars or
cigarettes. Insurance companies reject men who show signs of excessive
use of tobacco. Why? Because they are apt to die before their time.
The Interborough Rapid Transit Company of New York City rejects
applicants for motormen and conductors "for excessive or
long-continued use of tobacco." Why? Because, other things being
equal, [368]such men are more apt to lose their nerve in an emergency and
to fail to read signals or instructions correctly.

Armed with these weapons against tobacco, parents and teachers can
effectively introduce physiological arguments against excessive use,
against use by those who suffer from nervous or heart trouble, and
against any use whatever by those who have not reached physical
maturity. By avoiding physiological arguments that children will
not       cannot       believe contrary to their own eyes, parents and teachers
are able to speak dogmatically of that which children will
believe,       injuries to children, evils of excess, restrictions as to
time and place, and offensiveness to nonsmokers. But even here it is
wrong, as it is inexpedient, to leave the physical strength of the
next generation to the persuasive power of parents and teachers or to
the faith and knowledge of minors. Society should protect all minors
against their own ignorance, their own desires, the ignorance of
parents and associates, and against the economic motive of tobacco
sellers by machinery that enforces the law.






[369]

CHAPTER XXXVIIToC

THE PATENT-MEDICINE EVIL


"Dhrugs," says Dock O'Leary, "are a little iv a pizen that a
little more iv wud kill ye. Ye can't stop people fr'm takin'
dhrugs, an' ye might as well give thim somethin' that will look
important enough to be inthrojuced to their important and fatal
cold in th' head. If ye don't, they'll leap f'r th' patent
medicines. Mind ye, I haven't got annything to say agin' patent
medicines. If a man wud rather take them thin dhrink at a bar or
go down to Hop Lung's f'r a long dhraw, he's within his rights.
Manny a man have I known who was a victim iv th' tortures iv a
cigareet cough who is now livin' comfortable an' happy as an opeem
fiend be takin' Dr. Wheezo's Consumption Cure." The Dock says th'
more he practices medicine th' more he becomes a janitor with a
knowledge iv cookin'. He says if people wud on'y call him in
befure they got sick he'd abolish ivry disease in th' ward except
old age and pollyticks.

Thus Mr. Dooley with his usual wit and insight tells the American
people why they spend over two hundred million dollars annually on
patent medicines. Americans consume more drugs and use more patent
medicines than the people of any other country on the civilized globe.
Self-medication has grown to tremendous proportions. Everywhere       in
cars, on transfers, on billboards, in magazines, in newspapers, in the
mails       are advertised medicines to cure disease and devices to promote
health. When we consider that electric cars contain from thirty-two to
fifty-two advertisements each, three fourths of which are directly or
indirectly concerned with health; when we multiply these by the number
of cars actually in use in American cities; when we consider the
number of advertisements in magazines and daily papers, and the
enormous circulation of these papers and magazines; [370]when we consider
that an increasingly large proportion of advertising space is devoted
to health,       we begin to realize the cumulative power for good or for
evil that health advertisements must have.

To illustrate advertisements devoted to health to-day, I have kept
clippings for one week of news items, editorials, and advertisements
in a penny and a three-cent paper, and had them classified according
to the subjects treated:

[371]Besides the classic patent medicines, such as Lydia Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound, Castoria, Cod Liver Oil, etc., there are "Colds
Cured in One Day," "Appendixine," health foods, massage vibrators,
violet rays, Porosknit underwear, sanitary tooth washes, soaps,
vitopathic, naturopathic, and faith cures. New ones appear every
day,       enough to make a really sick person dizzy, let alone a person
suffering from imaginary ailments. All seem to outline my particular
symptoms. After they have flamed at me in red letters in the surface
cars, pursued me in the elevated and underground, accompanied me out
into the country and back again to the city, greeted me each morning
in the daily paper and in my daily mail, each week or each month in
the periodical, the coincidence of a familiar package on a drug-store
counter seems to be providential and therefore irresistible. I know
that I ought to be examined by a physician, but I am busy and not
unwilling to gamble for my health; it cannot kill me and there is a
chance that it will cure me. If there is nothing the matter with us,
we may be cured by our faith. If we are taking a cure for consumption,
the morphine in it may lull us into thinking we feel better. If we are
taking a tonic for spring fever, the cheap alcohol may excite us into
thinking our vitality has been heightened. Soothing sirup soothes the
baby, often doping its spirit for life, or soothing it into a sleep
from which it never wakes.

In spite of the fact that the "Great American Fraud" has been exposed
repeatedly in newspapers and magazines of wide circulation, the appeal
of the quack still catches men and women of intelligence. The other
night a friend went out to a dinner and conference with a lawyer in
the employ of the national government. Annoyed by a nagging headache,
he made for the nearest drug store and ordered a "headache powder." He
admitted that it was an awful dose, but he had been told that it
always "did the business." [372]He knew the principle was bad, confessed
to a scorn for friends of his whom he knew to be bromo-seltzer fiends,
but he had the headache and the work to do       a sure cure and a quick
one seemed imperative. The headache was due to overwork, indigestion,
constipation. Plain food and quiet sleep was what he needed most. But
the dinner conference plus the headache was the unanswerable argument
for a dose with an immediate result.

Last winter an Irish maid slowly lost her rosy cheeks and grew
hollow-eyed and thin. She was taken to a specialist who discovered a
rapidly advancing case of consumption. He said that owing to the
girl's ignorance, stupidity, and homesickness, her only chance of
recovery was to return to the "auld countrie" at once. The girl agreed
to go, but insisted on a few days "to talk it over with her cousins in
New York." After two weeks had elapsed she was found in a stuffy,
overcrowded New York tenement. She had found a doctor who had given
her a little bottle of medicine for two dollars, which would cure her
in the city. It was futile to protest. Days in the unventilated
tenement and nights in a "dark room" meant that she would never live
to finish the bottle.

For a year Miss H. took a patent preparation for chronic catarrh. It
seemed to "set her up"; but it so undermined her strength, through its
artificial nerve spur, that chronic catarrh was followed by
consumption. It later transpired that the cure's chief ingredient was
whisky, and cheap whisky. A good grandmother, herself a vigorous
temperance agitator and teetotaler, offered to pay for it as long as
my friend would take it faithfully. The irony of it makes one wonder
how many earnest advocates of total abstinence are in reality addicted
to the liquor habit.

Last summer a district nurse of the summer corps who visited city
babies under two years of age encountered in the hallway of a tenement
a bevy of frenzied women. A [373]baby lay on the bed gasping and "rolling
its eyes up into the top of its head." The nurse asked the frightened
mother what she had been giving it. "Nothing at all," said the woman.
But a telltale bottle of soothing sirup showed that the child was
dying from morphine poisoning. Happily the nurse came in time to save
it.

Is it not pitiful, this grasping for a poison in an extremity; this
seizing of a defective rope to escape the fire?




LEARNING HOW TO KEEP BABY WELL WITHOUT PATENT MEDICINES
Recreation Pier, New York City, Summer, 1908


The patent-medicine evil cannot be cured by occasional exposure or by
overexposure. Nor can it be cured by legislation, legislation,
legislation, unless laws are rigidly enforced.

Occasional exposure is no better than occasional advertising of good
things. The patent-medicine business thrives on constant, not
occasional, advertising. Leading advertisers expect so little from the
first notice that they would not take the trouble to write out a
single advertisement. That is the reason merchants charge advertising
in [374]the programmes of church, festival, and glee-club concert to
charity, not to business. Warning people once does no more lasting
good than sending a child to school once a month. The exposure of
patent-medicine evils must be as constant as efforts to sell the
medicines.

Overexposure is ineffective. It is the evils of patent medicines that
do harm, not their name and not their patents. The medical profession
has in vain protested against proprietary medicines. Ethical barriers
cannot be erected by resolution. Calling things unethical does not
make them unethical. The mere patenting of medicines for profit does
not make the medicine injurious any more than the mere mixing of
unpatented drugs makes a physician safe. Physicians who would not
themselves patent a drug will use certain patented drugs whose
ingredients are known to be safe and uniform. True exposure of
patent-medicine evils will enable the average physician and the
average layman to distinguish the dangerous from the safe, the fraud
from the genuine, lies from truths.

Legislation is needed to crystallize modern knowledge and to establish
in courts the right to protection against the evils of patent
medicines. The national Pure Food Law, passed January 1, 1907, and now
in force throughout the country, requires on the "labels of all
proprietary medicines entering into interstate commerce, a statement
of the quantity or proportion of any alcohol, morphine, opium, heroin,
chloroform, cannabis indica, chloral hydrate, or acetanilid, or any
derivative or preparation of any such substance contained therein;
this information must be in type not smaller than eight-point capital
letters; also the label shall embody no statement which shall be
false or misleading in any particular." This law does not forbid
patent medicines nor the use of alcohol and narcotics in patent
medicines; it merely says, "Let the label tell, that all who buy may
read." It does not require that all [375]who run may read, for it does
not say that advertisements of a patent medicine shall tell the truth
about its ingredients or its action on the human body; only that the
label on the bottle shall tell. The object of this law is to explain
to the consumer the exact nature of the medicine. But to the majority
of people the word "acetphenitidin" on the label of a headache
medicine does not explain. The new order that requires manufacturers
to substitute acetanilid for acetphenitidin does no more than replace
fog with mist. Protection requires legislation that cannot be evaded
by technical terms. The present law requires that packages must be
properly labeled on entering the state. To carry out the national
law, state laws should make it an offense for dealers to have in their
possession proprietary medicines without explanatory labels that
explain. Where state laws to this effect do not exist, the packages
once in the state may be deprived of their labels and sold as secret
remedies, thus nullifying the whole effect of the national law.

Enforcement must be insured. Impure drugs may do as much harm as
patent medicines containing harmful drugs. In New York a vigorous
campaign was recently inaugurated by the department of health to drive
out impure drugs. Drugs are dangerous enough at their best. When they
are not what they pretend to be, whether patented or not, they may
take life. One extreme case where a patient's heart was weakened when
it ought to have been strengthened, led to the discovery that
practically all of one particular drug offered for sale in New York
City was unfit to use and calculated to kill in the emergency where
alone it would be used. Yesterday four lives and several million
dollars were lost in a New York fire because the hose was rotten or
weak. As inspection and testing were needed to insure hose equal to
emergency pressure, so inspection and testing of patent medicines and
drugs are needed to make legislation effectual.

[376]Legislation and enforcement should reach the newspaper, magazine,
billboard, street car, that advertises a falsehood or less than the
essential truth regarding drugs, foods, and patent medicines. Public
sentiment condemns the advertising of many opportunities to commit
crime or to be disorderly or indecent or to injure one's neighbor. The
facts about hundreds of nostrums can be absolutely determined. The
advertising agency, whether secular or religious, that carries
misrepresentation of drugs and foods should be forbidden circulation
through the mails. The existence of such advertisements should be made
evidence of complicity in a public offense and punished accordingly.
Treat them as we treated the Louisiana lottery. Boards of health,
instead of furnishing names to druggists and manufacturers who want to
sell patent foods and medicines, should print circulars exposing
frauds, and punish so far as the law permits.

While trying to secure adequate legislation and efficient
administration of the above-mentioned standards, there is much that
can be done by individuals and clubs. We can give preference to those
journals that refuse drug and food advertisements unless evidence is
produced that the truth is told and that the goods are not harmful. We
can refuse to have in the house a paper or journal which prints
notices that lie or that conceal the truth. If this drastic measure
would cut us off entirely from daily papers, we could choose the least
offensive and petition it to exclude specific lying methods. When it
preaches health, honesty, and philanthropy, we can cut out of one
issue the noble editorial and the exploiting advertisements and send
them to the editor with our protest. Knowledge of the ingredients and
dangers of patent medicines should be a prerequisite for the practice
of medicine or pharmacy. We can help bring about such conditions, and
we can patronize physicians who send patients to drug stores that
cater to intelligence rather than to ignorance.

[377]Fighting patent-medicine evils is a civic duty to be accomplished by
civic co      peration, not private effort. It is impossible to organize
unofficial educational agencies that can offset the cumulative, lying
advertisement. Personal opposition is but the beginning. Official
machinery must be set running and kept running so as to protect the
public health against the commercial motive that preys upon ignorance
and easily inspired faith.

CHAPTER XXXVIIIToC

HEALTH ADVERTISEMENTS THAT PROMOTE HEALTH


It is usually considered futile to attempt to defeat the devil with
his own methods, because he knows so much better how to use them. But
abuse does not do away with use, and the success of quacks in reaching
the people demands our respect. There is no reason why their methods,
based on a knowledge of human nature and human psychology, should not
be employed to appeal to needs rather than to weaknesses. A good thing
may lie unused because of lack of advertisement. Vitality is coming to
be the passion of the American people. It is on this sincere passion
that fakirs have so long traded.

There can be no doubt that advertisements of health-promoting goods
are quite as profitable as health advertisements that injure health,
when equally effective methods are used to make them reach the public.
The tradition has been repeatedly mentioned in this book that the
better the doctor, the less he advertises himself, except in medical
and scientific journals that notoriously fail to reach the people. The
same is too often true of reputable remedies and goods. The theory
that these things stand or fall on their merits is not borne out by
practical experience,       conspicuously in the case of "fake" remedies.
Purely philanthropic undertakings for the advancement of health fail,
if not placed before the people whom they aim to help in an
attractive, convincing form. Failure to advertise a worthy cause
limits its usefulness, and is therefore unjustifiable, whether we
speak of medicine, legal aid, or dental clinics.

[379]An intensive study of the methods used to advertise patent medicines
will suggest means of extending the usefulness of health-promoting
goods. Aside from clever methods of suggestion that lead many people
to take medicine for imaginary ailments, especially seasonal ailments,
patent-remedy advertisers have employed (as an argument for the
efficiency of their cures) scientific theory, bacterial origin of
diseases, recent medical or physiological discoveries, and state and
national movements for promoting health. In fact, they have turned to
their own uses the very law that seeks to control them and the
exposures that seek to exterminate them. Whatever may be the merits of
Castoria, the "Don't Poison Baby" advertisement on the following page,
printed just after the accompanying "Babies Killed by Patent
Medicines," which appeared in a home journal, was surely a clever bit
of advertising. Upon an editorial in a daily paper on the relation of
eyeglasses to headache and indigestion, an optician based a promise of
immediate relief for these ailments if he himself were patronized. The
recent investigations of the Department of Agriculture, and of
Professors Chittenden and Fisher, in regard to foodstuffs, are proving
helpful to food quacks and advertisers of pills for constipation and
indigestion. Since the passage of the Pure Food Law one health food is
advertised in a column headed "Pure Food."

When the season for pneumonia comes around numerous medicines are
"sure cures" for grippe and pneumonia. "Rosy teachers look better in
the schoolroom than the sallow sort," is surely a good introduction to
a new food. Woman's vanity sells many a remedy advertised to
counteract the "vandal hand of disease, which robs her of her beauty,
yellows and muddies her complexion, lines her face, pales cheek and
lip, dulls the brilliancy of her eye, which it disfigures with dark
circles, aging her before her time." Who in your town is as good a
friend to "owners of bad breath" as the advertiser who tells them that
they "whiff out odor which makes [380]those standing near them turn their
heads away in disgust"? The climax of effective educational
advertising as well as of consummate presumption and villainy is
reached in the notice of an alcoholic concoction that uses the
headline, "Medical Supervision Needed to Prevent the Spread of
Consumption in the Schools." Thus grafting itself on the successful
results of the medical examination in the Massachusetts schools, it
enlists the aid of teachers, trades on the fear of tuberculosis, even
indorses the fresh-air treatment. So convincing was this appeal that
it was reprinted in the [381]news columns of a daily paper in New York as
official advice to school children.






So clever are these methods of advertising and so successful are they
in reaching great numbers of people, that if reputable physicians
would take lessons of them, they might conduct a health crusade that
would exterminate tuberculosis, diminish the use of alcohol and
tobacco, and save thousands of babies that die unnecessarily. The
theory of patent-medicine advertising is sound. It emphasizes the joys
of health, the beauty of health, the earning power of health. It
adapts its message to season, event, and need. It offers testimonials
of real persons cured. It is all-appealing, promising, convincing,       a
fearful menace to health when the remedies offered are dishonest, a
universal opportunity for promoting health if the cure is genuine.

A classic example of health advertising that promotes health is
Sapolio. The various hygiene lessons that have promoted Sapolio have
done much to raise the standard of living in the United States. Few
eminent physicians have done so much for public health as the "Poor
M.D. of Spotless Town who scoured the country for miles around, but
the only case he could find was a case of Sapolio."

Recent press discussions about furnishing free eyeglasses to the
children in the public schools have so enlightened people as to the
need for expert examination of their eyes that opticians will be
forced to employ competent oculists to make the preliminary
examination and to see that the glasses are properly adjusted. In
spite of the long mis-education by makers of corsets, the persistent
advertising of "good health" and "common-sense" waists has gained an
increasing number of recruits from the ranks of the self-persecuting.
It is only a matter of time when the term "stylish" will be
transferred to the advocates of health, because advertisers who tell
the truth will, if persistent, gain a larger patronage than
advertisers of falsehoods; there [382]is profit in retaining old
customers. The advertisement of a window device for "Fresh air while
you sleep" will make prevention of tuberculosis more profitable than
"sure cures" that lie and kill.

A man deserves profit who sends this message to millions of readers:

There are three kinds of cleanliness:

First, the ordinary soap-and-water cleanliness.
Second, the so-called "beauty" cleanliness.
Third, prophylactic cleanliness, or the cleanliness that "guards
against disease."

But the man who sells soap ought to be the one to use this
advertisement, not a man who sells toothwash that, when pure, is
little better than water, that is seldom pure, and that always hurts
the teeth. Many children and adults are being cured of flat foot by
men who make money by selling shoes designed to strengthen the arch of
the foot. Millions would never know how to discover the evil effects
upon themselves of coffee and alcohol except for money-making
advertisements. Little Jo's Smile taught a nation that the majority of
crippled children are victims of neglect on the part of adult
consumptives.

Certain it is that advertising is an art promoted by the severest
competition of the cleverest brains. It is a force which we cannot
afford to ignore. If we can harness it to the promotion of aids to
health, it will do more good than all the hygiene books ever written.
To this end we must educate ourselves to distinguish between goods
which do what they profess to do and those which do not. A good eye
opener would be to keep for a week clippings from a high-priced daily
paper, a penny daily paper, and one or two representative magazines,
including a religious paper. Teachers and parents can very easily
interest children in such clippings. Moreover, they can use the
bulletin method, [383]the stereopticon exhibit, the cumulative
illustration of a fact, which is the essence of successful
advertising. Boards of health can use all the typographical aids to
clear understanding,       cuts, diagrams, interesting anecdotes. In New
York both the health board and the school board have issued circulars
and given illustrated lectures, some of them being in school and some
on public squares. Medical and sanitary societies and other educators
can be induced to follow what a successful business man has called the
three cardinal rules of advertising:

First, put your advertisement where it will be seen. (Tell your
story where it will be heard.)

Second, write it so that people will read it. (Tell it so that
people will understand it.)

Third, tell the truth, so that people will believe it.






[384]

CHAPTER XXXIXToC

IS CLASS INSTRUCTION IN SEX HYGIENE PRACTICABLE?


Among remedies for preventable disease and preventable poverty, the
following was urged at a national conference for the betterment of
social conditions: "We have been too prudish. Because we have been
unwilling to teach school children the evils of violating sex hygiene,
we have been unsuccessful in combating evils justly attributable to
ignorance on the part of girls as to the duties and dangers of
motherhood." This point of view is shared by so many men and women
that a national body was organized in 1905 to promote the teaching of
sex hygiene,       the Society for Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis. This
society has its headquarters in New York, and distributes at cost
lectures and essays. The second of its educational pamphlets is
addressed to teachers, and is entitled "Instruction in the Physiology
and Hygiene of Sex." The introduction asks eleven questions of the
teachers as follows:

1. Do you wish a pamphlet on sex subjects to hand to your pupils?
Why?

2. Do you wish separate pamphlets for boys and girls?

3. For what age limits and social conditions do you wish them?

4. What topics do you wish the pamphlets for boys to "handle"?

5. What topic do you wish the pamphlet for girls to "handle"?

6. If you think one pamphlet sufficient for both sexes, what
should it consider?

7. How far do you go in teaching sexual hygiene or reproduction?
By what method?

[385]8. What special difficulties do you find in teaching it?

9. What special need of teaching it have you found?

10. What special benefits (or otherwise) have you noticed from
teaching it?

11. What criticisms (favorable or otherwise) do you encounter?

The difficulty of introducing formal instruction in sex hygiene, even
in the upper grades of public and private schools, is hinted at in the
pamphlet. The purpose of the publishing society as given in its
constitution is "to eliminate the spread of diseases which have their
origin in the social evil." Although sex hygiene does not begin with
sex immorality, almost every text-book on sex hygiene, and almost
every pamphlet urging class instruction in sex hygiene, begins with
sex immorality. Yet only the exceptional school child is in danger of
violating sex morals, while every school child needs instruction in
sex hygiene.

Instruction in sex hygiene, whether at school or at home, should deal
with sex normality, sex health, sex temperance. Instruction in sex
immorality is objectionable, not merely because it offends prudists,
not because it is difficult, but because it can be shown by experience
to be less efficacious than training in sex health.

To expect fear to prompt sex hygiene is to make a mistake that has
retarded the development of sound measures in the treatment of
offenders against criminal law. For centuries man failed in attempts
to fit the punishment to the crime. To deter men from committing crime
by holding up a threat of prolonged and dreadful punishment has been
found futile. Individuals take the risk because they think they will
escape detection. It is an axiom of criminal procedure that a would-be
offender is deterred by the certainty, not by the severity, of
punishment. The modern theory of probation is, that children and
adults may be best led away from evil practices by crowding out old
influences with newer and stronger interests. Occupations [386]that are
wholesome are made to rival diversions or occupations that are harmful
and criminal.




OBJECT LESSONS FOR INSTRUCTION IN SEX HEALTH
Note the uncomfortable, unhealthy overdressing


Abnormal conditions of mind and body in regard to sex can almost
always be traced to general physical ill health or to an unhealthy
moral environment. Cure and prevention require two kinds of treatment
within reach of parents and teachers: (1) build up the child's
physical condition; and (2) give him other interests. Proper physical
care, and work adjusted to body and mind, may be relied upon to do
infinitely more to promote sex hygiene than instruction, either at
home or at school, in immoral sex diseases. That sex morality is weak
and untrustworthy which is based upon fear of sex diseases. Like
alcoholism and nicotinism, the saddest results of sex diseases are
social and economic. The strongest reasons against such diseases are
economic and social, not physiological.

[387]


THE STUDY OF INFANT HEALTH IS CONDUCIVE TO PURE-MINDEDNESS
Note the simple, comfortable, hygienic dress


Once having made up our minds to concentrate the teaching of sex
hygiene upon sex health rather than upon sex immorality, upon sex
functions rather than upon sex diseases, the chief objection to school
instruction and to instruction in class will disappear. Our school
text-books in history, literature, and biology abound in references to
sex distinctions, sex functions, and sex health. In enumerating the
daily routine of health habits I mentioned daily bathing of the
armpits and crotch. There is nothing in this injunction to offend or
injure a boy or girl. If studies and physical training are to be
adapted to physiological age, and if children are to know why they are
graded according to physiological age as well as mental brightness, we
shall soon be talking of mature, maturing and not-yet-maturing [388]girls
and boys, so that everybody will be instructed in sex hygiene without
offense. Any teacher who can explain the family troubles of King Henry
VIII without becoming self-conscious can easily learn to look a class
of girls and boys in the face and explain how a mother's health will
injure her baby before its birth, why breast-fed babies are more apt
to live than bottle-fed babies, why it is as important for the mother
to keep a nursing breast absolutely clean as to clean the nipple of a
nursing bottle. Words whispered by children, or marked in
dictionaries, to be stealthily and repeatedly looked upon and talked
over with other children, lose all their glamour when pronounced by a
teacher.

In these days of state subsidy of school libraries the child is hard
to find who has not free access to books of fiction full of voluptuous
allusions that make undesirable impressions which only blunt, candid
discussion of sex facts can make harmless. Children now learn, whether
in fashionable private schools or crowded slums, practically all that
is lascivious and unwholesome about sex. For teachers to explain that
which is wholesome and pure will disinfect the minds of most children
and protect them against miseducation.

Class instruction in hygiene is practicable for all matters pertaining
to normal sex health. Girls of thirteen should be taught in classes
the fact and meaning of menstruation, and its grave importance to the
health, in order that they may care for themselves not only before,
during, and immediately after the menstrual period, but throughout the
month, in order that menstruation itself shall not be unnecessarily
painful, enervating, and harmful to efficiency. It is not yet
advisable to discuss dangers peculiar to girls or dangers peculiar to
boys in mixed classes. Generally speaking, it is undesirable that men
teachers discuss girls' troubles with girl pupils. But why should it
not become possible for women teachers to explain health dangers
peculiar to girls to classes of boys?

[389]Individual instruction in sex matters should be reserved for the
diseased mind, for the boy or girl who has already been morbidly
instructed. Discussion of immoral sex diseases should be confined to
individual talk. This field teachers have already entered. Repeated
physical examination of children will detect symptoms of sex
abnormality. When detected, the fact and the meaning should be
explained to the individual by school physician, school nurse, or
school-teacher. While much can be done through mothers' meetings and
through individual instruction of parents, the most effective means of
improving the general attitude towards sex health is to give the
simple truth to the millions of children who have not yet left school.
Armed with the A B C's of sex hygiene at school, boys and girls will
be prepared to select employment, associates, and newspapers that will
permit normal, healthy sex development. Men and women who are leading
normal lives, who have plenty of work, sleep, fresh air, nourishing
food, amusement, and exercise are unlikely to be sexually abnormal.

After all, the question of instruction in sex hygiene will quickly
settle itself when it is made a condition of a teacher's certificate
that the applicant shall himself or herself know the personal and
social reasons for sex health. The woman who does not know how to take
care of her own sex health, the man who is ignorant of a woman's
special needs, cannot do justice to the requirements of arithmetic,
language, and discipline. Whether men and women teachers are mentally,
physically, and morally equipped to be sexually normal and to teach
the law of sex health will be disclosed as soon as trustees and
superintendent dare to ask the necessary questions. Whether an
instructor's personality will enable him to fill the minds of children
with interests more wholesome, more absorbing than obscene stories or
morbid sex curiosity can also be learned. When school-teachers are
prepared to teach the [390]social and economic aspects of general health
they will quickly solve the problem of instruction in sex health.

Just one word about country morality. It is customary to deplore the
influence of large cities on the young. Of late, however, there has
been a tendency to question whether, after all, sex morality is apt to
be higher in the country than in the city. Parents and teachers in
small towns and in rural districts will do well to take an inventory
of the influences surrounding their children. It will always be
impossible to give country children city diversions. One great
disadvantage of country children frequently counter-acts the
beneficial influence of out-of-door living; namely, isolation. The
city child is practically always in or about to be in the sight of, if
not in the presence of, other people. Numbers and close contact with
people, though they be strangers, mean restraint and pervading social
conscience. City children find it difficult to have good times in
pairs. No amount of instruction of rural pupils in sex hygiene will
take the place of amusements and entertainments for groups of
children, forming thus a special antidote for "two's company, three's
a crowd." Liberating and standardizing normal intersex relations and
discouraging cramped social intersex relations are more urgent needs
than instruction in sex diseases. A working environment that permits
pure-mindedness will do more to inculcate a reverence for sex
cleanliness and for parenthood than lectures and essays on moral
prophylaxis.






[391]

CHAPTER XLToC

THE ELEMENT OF TRUTH IN QUACKERY; HYGIENE OF THE MIND


Patent medicines and other forms of quackery could not pay such
enormous dividends unless there was some truth in their claims; unless
their victim found some beneficial return for his money. They win
confidence because they raise hopes and combat fear. They do cure
thousands of people of fear and of "ingrowing thoughts." In so doing
they remove the sole cause of much disability.[17] In so doing they
are merely applying by wholesale principles of mental hygiene that are
legitimately used by physicians, tradesmen, teachers, and parents who
deal successfully with nervousness.

Quackery makes cures and makes money because of the undoubted
influence of mind in causing and in removing those ailments that
originate in fear, imagination, or morbid introspection. A few years
ago a little out-of-the-way town in southern Minnesota was visited by
train loads of the sick and crippled from miles around. Miraculous
cures were heralded broadcast. Life-long cripples left wagon loads of
crutches and braces to decorate the little church with the enchanted
transom. People who had not walked for years returned to their homes
cured. The marvels of famous shrines were fast being duplicated when
the church authorities at St. Paul issued an explanation of the
alleged miraculous appearance of biblical figures in the transom of
the new church. The outlines of a mother carrying a baby had [392]been
vaguely impressed in the transom glass when molten. When the mystery
was explained the excursions and the cures stopped.

Nearly every physician and practically every medical charlatan can
count scores of cures of ailments that had previously defied the skill
of eminent physicians. A child's bumps actually stop aching after the
mother or nurse kisses the abused spot. Invalids forget their
limitations under stress of some great excitement or some intense
desire for pleasures incompatible with invalidism. Many a physician of
reputation owes his success in great part to the discriminating use of
the placebo,       a bread pill designed to supplant the patient's fear
with confidence. Hypnotism and "suggestion" have been successfully
used to cure alcoholism and to fill patients' minds with conviction
stronger than the fear that produced the sickness. A well-known writer
and preacher cures insomnia by auto-suggestion, telling himself he is
sleepy, is very sleepy, is going to sleep, is almost asleep, is fast
asleep. Treatment by osteopathy has been followed by disappearance of
diseases that cannot possibly be cured by osteopathy. Christian
Science has restored to health and happy usefulness hundreds of
thousands of chronic invalids. Verily is hygiene of the mind an
important factor in the civics of health.

Fear can originate with mind. Fear produces fear. Fear disarranges
circulation of the blood and the nourishment of muscle and nerve. Fear
can produce many bodily disorders which in turn feed fear. Fear cannot
last unless bodily symptoms exist or arise to justify and feed it.
Fear can be cured and removed in two ways: (1) by driving away fear
and releasing bodily disorders from its thraldom; (2) by removing the
disorders and making fear impossible to the logical mind. An enforced
sea voyage begins with the disorder; a clever, buoyant physician
begins with the fear. Patent-medicine proprietors, quacks, and fakes
of every [393]kind begin by displacing the fear with hope or cheer; the
physical disorders frequently vanish by the same window as fear. For
fear write self-pity, morbid self-consciousness, hypertrophied
submission; to hope and cheer add smile, relaxation, and
zest; and we have the chief elements of mental hygiene and the
reason why intelligent as well as unintelligent men like to be
swindled by medical or other quacks.

The social aspects of mental hygiene are particularly important. Once
admitting the power of the mind to decrease vitality, we recognize the
duty of seeming happy, buoyant, cheerful, vital, at least when with
others, for the sake of others' minds and bodies. Secondly, we find
the duty to refrain from commenting on others' appearance in a way
that will start "ingrowing thoughts." A "grouchy" foreman can give
blues and indigestion to a roomful of factory girls. A self-pitying
teacher can check the heart beats of her class, cause arteries and
lungs to contract, and deprive the brain of fresh blood. An
oversympathetic neighbor can put a strong man to bed by discovering
signs of nervous disintegration. Shall we gradually work out a code of
mental hygiene rights and nuisances that will require compulsory
notification of the "blues" and compulsory segregation of every person
unable to "smile dull care away"? Is the time coming when boards of
health will accompany infection leaflets with messages such as this
from James Whitcomb Riley:


Talk health. The dreary, never-changing tale
Of mortal maladies is worn and stale.
You cannot charm or interest or please
By harping on that minor chord, disease.

"Whatever the weather may be," says he,
"Whatever the weather may be,
It's the songs ye sing, and the smiles ye wear,
That's a-making the sun shine everywhere."


[394]Mental hygiene has hitherto enjoyed an evil reputation and has been
condemned to generally evil associations, because the rank and file
have been ignorant of hygiene of every kind. Medical science has so
long enveloped itself in mystery that it is in danger now of becoming
discredited and of falling heir to the mantle of quackery.

Quacks often get social and economic results more agreeable to the
patient and more helpful to society than orthodox medicine. "When
traitors become numerous enough treason becomes respectable." So when
mental hygiene succeeds, it becomes science for the case in question,
and for that case orthodox medicine loses its respectability. For the
layman there is no safety except in having intelligence enough to know
whether his trouble has defied the sincere application of mental
treatment, auto-suggestion, and loyalty to the health ideal.

Mental hygiene admits the existence of dental cavities, scarlet fever
germs, adenoids, cross-eyes, uncleanliness, broken legs, inflamed
eyes, overeating. The organic, structural defects which are to be
sought by physical examination are all admitted by mental hygienists.
They work for an orderly, daily routine and affirm the penalties of
its violation. They would even favor going periodically to a
physician, provided that we never go to him except when organic or
structural disorders may safely be assumed from the fact that cheer
and relaxation treatment does not give relief. Unhygienic living and
mind cure cannot go together. The mind that tries to deceive itself
cannot cure either mind or body. The man who violates the habits of
health cannot patch his injuries or conceal the ravages of dissipation
by mental hygiene. Here is the great advantage of knowing how to live
hygienically, of observing habits of health, and then concerning
ourselves not with ourselves, but with conditions of living for all
those whose health can be affected by our health, or can affect our
health and efficiency.

[395]The most recent practical application of mental hygiene for moral and
physical uplifting is the "moral clinic" or "psychotherapeutic" clinic
established by Emmanuel Church in Boston. This clinic represents the
union of three forces,       religion, medical diagnosis, mental hygiene.
As a result of this alliance it is anticipated that both religion and
medicine will be humanized, socialized, vitalized, made to express
more accurately and more consistently that community consciousness and
that yearning for equal opportunity and equal happiness which
constitute the profoundest religious impulse. No person is treated at
this moral clinic whose trouble is organic or structural. In
determining whether the case belongs to this clinic, expert medical
diagnosis is relied upon rather than the credulity of the patient or
the zeal of the clergyman. Medical scientists of highest repute can
consistently co      perate, because they recognize two scientific facts:
first, that many troubles are due primarily to mental disorder; and,
second, the greatest asset of the human mind is that something called
religion, which is no less real and potent because peculiar to each
individual. Whatever may be that deepest current of thought and
feeling, whatever that synthetic philosophy, that explanation of
being, which guides my life, it can be of inestimable aid if enlisted
in an effort to secure normal vitality of mind and body.

The controlling motive of the moral clinic has proved infectious.
There is reason to believe that the alliance of medicine and religion
has come to stay, and that the present excitement over
psychotherapeutics will settle down into a scientific utilization of
religious motive and medical knowledge to prevent mental and moral
disease. Unwholesome, morbid, self-centered thought is driven out. A
recognition of others' claims takes its place. Hypnotism, suggestion,
and group enthusiasm are used to their utmost possibilities. The
success of the Boston moral clinic is due to establishing [396]in the mind
of the neurasthenic, the alcoholic, the world-weary, and the
purposeless a truer conception of the pleasures that result from
vitality and from altruistic effort.

It is too early to classify by kind of functional disorder the
patients treated. Results from one patient have been described in
newspapers as follows:

A school-teacher, as a result of nervous collapse, had lost
control, began to fear the children under her care, and thought of
relinquishing her profession. She was instructed in the art of
self-control and the control of others; the notion of fear was
dislodged and a sentiment of love for her little charges took its
place. In the course of a few weeks this conscientious and
experienced teacher regained her poise and found herself
performing her duties better than ever before.

Many alcoholics have for months given evidences of complete cure.
Stories almost incredible are quickening pastor and physician alike
throughout the country. After individual treatments are given, after
religious motive is appealed to, and the soul stirred to heed the
lessons of religion, medicine, and sociology, patients are given the
work cure. Thus a branch of social service is established, where
after-treatment is given to the patient whose thoughts have been
turned from himself to others. All of a sudden the church finds itself
in need of definite knowledge as to opportunities for altruistic work,
as to definite community needs not met, as to people in distress who
can be relieved by volunteers, as to agencies which can be called upon
to co      perate both in treating the individual and in utilizing his
energies for others' benefits.

Because a relatively small percentage of men and women are
neurasthenic, melancholy, morbid, alcoholic, the lesson of the moral
clinic is most serviceable when extended for the benefit of the "not
yet alcoholic" and the "not quite neurasthenic." In other words,
individuals in thinking of [397]themselves must learn the health value and
soul value of purpose that centers in others' happiness. That thing
which we have called tact in personality, and which in the past was
discovered by induction, namely, the law of mental hygiene and the
control it gives over others' health, must be taught in schools to
children by wholesale, must be taught in medical and theological
schools, to all physicians and all pastors. This alliance of medicine
and religion, which is at present confined to one or two moral
clinics, should be incorporated into education, into social work, into
church work, becoming thus a part of civilization's normal point of
view.

Mental hygiene cannot survive conscious violation of the fundamental
laws of medicine and religion. The alliance of medicine and religion
will prove utterly futile unless habits of living and of thinking are
inculcated that conform to nature's law of self-preservation and to
God's law of brotherly love. Self-centered religion, like
self-centered medicine, destroys both body and soul.

CHAPTER XLIToC

"A NATURAL LAW IS AS SACRED AS A MORAL PRINCIPLE"


When a grammar-school boy I learned from the game "Quotations" that
Louis Agassiz, scientist, had written the sentence with which I
introduce a final appeal for living that will permit physical and
civic efficiency. Agassiz has been called "America's greatest
educator," and again "the finest specimen yet discovered of the genus
homo, of the species intelligens." The story of his long life as
teacher of teachers reads like a romance. But among his gifts to
education and citizenship none can be made to mean more than the
simple proposition that natural law is as sacred as a moral principle.
All who remember this "beatitude" will be helped to solve many
perplexing problems of dress, diet, play, education, philanthropy,
morals, and civics.

Reverence for the natural carries with it a distaste for the
unnatural. Those who obey natural law soon come to regard its
violation as a nuisance when not immoral. On the other hand,
compromise with the unnatural, like compromise with vice, quickly
leads first to toleration and thence to interest and practice.
Therefore the importance of giving children Agassiz's conception of
the sacredness of the laws that govern the human body. A passion for
the natural is a strong foundation for habits of health and a
priceless possession for one who wishes to know morality in its
highest sense.

"Natural" is less attractive to us than it would be had Agassiz first
interpreted it for us rather than Rousseau or present-day exponents of
"the simple life," "back to nature," [399]and "back to the land." It is
too often forgotten that no one sins against natural law more
grievously than the primitive man or the isolated man in daily contact
with non-human nature. Communing with nature seems not only to require
communing with man but to give joys in proportion as the nature lover
is concerned for the human society of which he is a part. Natural law
does not become a moral principle until man is benefited or injured by
man's use of nature's resources within and about him. Natural living
according to natural law must be something sounder, more beautiful,
and more progressive than can be read into or out of mountains, trees,
brooks, and sky, or primitive society.

Natural law points to a Nature Fore as well as a Nature Back, to a
Nature Up and Beyond as well as a Nature Down and Behind. The Nature
that was yesterday will not do for to-morrow, any more than a man is
willing to give up his nature aspirations for the careless, animal
ways of romping childhood. Civilization is constantly urged at each
step to repeat the prayer of Holmes's old man who dreams for the
Autocrat of the Breakfast Table:


Oh for one hour of youthful joy!
Give back my twentieth spring!
I'd rather laugh a bright-haired boy
Than reign a gray-beard king!

Off with the wrinkled spoils of age!
Away with learning's crown!
Tear out life's wisdom-written page,
And dash its trophies down!

One moment let my life blood stream
From boyhood's fount of flame!
Give me one giddy, reeling dream
Of life all love and fame!


But every experiment in turning back exalts the present and the
future. Gifts as well as problems are seen to come [400]with complexity,
and civilization flatly refuses to relinquish these gifts. Sound
maturity is better than youth or age:


The smiling angel dropped his pen,       
"Why, this will never do;
The man would be a boy again,
And be a father too!"


Problems of health and of civics can never be solved by appealing to
Nature Back, when only the few could be healthy, when one baby in
three died in infancy, when old age was toothless and childish, when
infection ravished nations, when the average life was twenty years
shorter than now, and when unspeakable filth was tolerated in air,
street, and house. They can all be solved by appeals to Nature Fore,
which holds up an ideal of mankind physically able to enjoy all the
benefits and to conquer all the dangers of civilization. It is not
looking back, but looking in and forward that reveals what natural law
promises to those who obey it.

By using numerous tests which have been suggested in preceding
chapters we can learn how far we and our communities obey natural law
when working and playing. Health for health's sake has nowhere been
urged. On the contrary, healthful living has been frankly valued for
its aid to efficient living by individual and by community; wherefore
the emphasis upon others' health and upon the civic aspects of our own
health. Tests furnish us with the technic necessary to efficient
living; civics, with the larger reason; natural law, with the "pillar
of fire by night" to help us choose our path among habits and
pleasures whose immediate results upon efficient living cannot easily
be determined.

Fashions, tastes, mannerisms, personal indulgences, have been left for
Agassiz to deal with. Generally speaking, we all know of numerous acts
committed and numerous acts [401]omitted in our daily routine that convict
us of not living up to our knowledge of physiology and
hygiene,       wearing tight shoes or tight corsets, drinking strong
coffee, smoking, reading while reclining, failing to insure clean air
and clean bodies. Then there are other acts whose omission or
commission violate no physical law so far as we can see, but whose
unnaturalness we concede,       putting chalk on the eyebrows, wearing
false hair or curious puffs, putting perfumery in the bath or on
handkerchiefs, assuming artificial poses of body or mouth. These
violations of natural law are forced upon us by "style" or "custom" or
family convenience. When we come to choose between following fashions
and disobeying them, we generally decide that it is better to do a
foolish or slightly harmful thing than to occasion criticism, mirth,
or even special notice by our dress or our abstemiousness.

Last night I went to a dinner party at eight. I ate and ate a great
variety of palatable foods that Nature Back never knew. After two
hours of eating I imbibed for two hours the tobacco smoke of the
gentlemen who made up the party. I knew that eight o'clock was too
late for me to begin eating, that two hours was too long to eat, that
the tobacco of others was bad for my health and for to-day's
efficiency. All this I knew when I accepted the invitation to dinner.
I went with no intention of preventing others from smoking or of
lecturing my host or his chef or his guests for the unhygienic
practices of our day. Yet the physical ills were more than offset by
certain definite gains to the school children of New York that will
result from last night's meeting. Natural law was abated in part. But
I declined certain dishes that would not agree with me, helped myself
sparingly of many dishes, avoided tobacco and wines, and by a
three-mile walk in the open air, a bath, and a good long night's sleep
have almost recovered my right to talk of the sacredness of natural
law.

[402]Nature Back says I should not have gone to this dinner. But I was
compelled to go. I know I am going to others. I cannot do my work
unless I overdraw my current health account. Nature Fore tells me that
effective co      peration with others will frequently require me to eat at
the dinner hour of others, to retire at others' sleeping time, to wear
what others will approve, to violate natural law. But Nature Fore also
tells me how to build up a health reserve so that I can meet these
emergencies without endangering my health credit.

Nature Back demands "dress reform." Nature Fore tells me that I can
march in step with my contemporaries without either attracting
attention or discrediting and affronting natural law. Passion for the
natural has effected numerous reforms in dress, diet, and social
habits, until commerce provides a natural adaptation of practically
every fashion. With regard to few things is it necessary to-day for
any one who reads magazines to do violence to bodily health for
fashion's sake. We may wear what we will, eat what we prefer, decline
what is unnatural for us, without inviting censure. The debauches of
those unfortunate people who live an unnatural, purposeless existence,
affect such a small number that their laws need not be considered
here. Natural law makes obedience to itself attractive; hence commerce
is rapidly learning to cater to distaste for the unnatural. With few
exceptions, only temporary concessions to unnatural living are
required in order to dress and act conventionally.

Nature Back throws little light upon conditions necessary for modern
labor. It can do nothing but demand the abolition of the factory, the
big store, the tenement, the school. Nature Fore says we cannot
abolish the means of working out the highest forms of co      peration. But
we can make them compatible with natural living. We can modify
conditions so that earning a livelihood will not compel workers [403]to
violate natural law at any or all times. The greatest need of factory
and tenement reform is for parents and teachers to make a religion of
Nature Fore and to instill its principles in the minds of children.
Parents and teachers must live the natural before they can make
children love the natural. Parents and teachers cannot possibly be
natural in this day, cannot live or love natural law unless they know
the machinery by which their communities are combating conditions
prejudicial to health, morals, and civic efficiency.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
